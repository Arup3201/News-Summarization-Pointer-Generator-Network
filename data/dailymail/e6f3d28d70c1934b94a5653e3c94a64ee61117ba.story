President Barack Obama said Monday that American politicians in an era of partisanship should try to carry themselves more like Edward M. Kennedy.

As politicians from both political parties lauded the late Massachusetts senator's collegial spirit at the dedication of an institute that bears his name, Obama said it was appropriate for Kennedy to want 'a monument not to himself but to what we the people have the power to do together.'

The $79 million institute, built next to the John F. Kennedy presidential library on Boston's Columbia Point, was envisioned by Kennedy before he was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. He died the following year.

The president said today that he he hoped the institute could help restore confidence in government at a time of great cynicism, giving a young student a chance to debate in its full-scale replica of the Senate chamber.

'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked.  

'What if our politics, our democracy, were as elevated as he envisions it to be?' Obama said. 

Instead, the president said citizens are cynical about government and disgusted by politicians' trivial pursuits and grandstanding for 'cameras instead of colleagues.'

'Fear so permeates our politics instead of hope. People fight to get in the Senate only to get afraid,' the president told some 1,800 Kennedy friends, family and politicians from both parties gathered for the dedication. 

He said Kennedy was never afraid to compromise with Republicans, even if it would anger his supporters. 

Speaker after speaker spoke of Kennedy's outsized influence on the Senate, where he served for 47 years, and held his consensus-building up in contrast to the gridlock that has become the hallmark of the modern Congress.

'No one made the Senate come alive like Ted Kennedy,' Obama said. 'It was one of the great pleasures of my life to hear Ted Kennedy deliver one of his stem winders on the Floor.'

Then an Illinois senator, Obama served in the upper chamber with Kennedy for roughly three and a half years before vacating office in preparation for his move to the White House.

Kennedy backed Obama for the Oval Office in 2008 over fellow senator Hillary Clinton of New York, comparing him in a speech to his brother John F. Kennedy, another young politician who ignored suggestions within the political class that he wait his turn in line and was successfully elected president.

The influential senator died the following year in August of 2009 several months after Obama took office.

Known as the 'Lion of the Senate,' Kennedy held his position as statesman in the U.S. Senate for nearly 50 years.

Obama praised Kennedy on Monday for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was on hand Monday for the event. 

It was 'common ground, not rooted in abstractions or stubborn, rigid ideologies, but shared experience, that led Ted and John McCain to work on a Patient’s Bill of Rights, and to work to forge a smarter, more just immigration system,' the president said.

'A common desire to fix what’s broken. A willingness to compromise in pursuit of a larger goal. A personal relationship that lets you fight like heck on one issue, and shake hands on the next -- not through just cajoling or horse-trading or serenades, but through Ted’s brand of friendship and kindness, and humor and grace.'

McCain remembered Kennedy's 'zest for political argument' and said they would often laugh together after fighting on the Senate floor. 

He said the Senate hasn't been the same without him. '

That's mostly for reasons unrelated to losing Ted, but I have no doubt the place would be a little more productive and a lot more fun if he were there,' McCain added.

Vice President Joe Biden said that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' when he arrived at the U.S. senate, and helped him into assignments usually not given to such junior politicians

'I miss fighting with him to be honest. It's gotten harder to find people who enjoy a good fight as much as Ted did,' he said to laughter.

Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Kennedy in the Senate as well, said he 'treated me like a little brother.' 

When Biden first arrived in 1973, Kennedy helped him land choice committee assignments not generally available to freshmen senators. Biden said Kennedy introduced him around the Senate and was a master at generating trust and mutual respect.

'All politics is personal,' Biden said. 'No one in my life understood that better than Ted Kennedy.'

Former Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott noted the irony of his inclusion on the institute's board of directors, along with former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle.

'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi,' said Lott, to laughter and applause, 'is proud to be here today.'

Lott said although the two disagreed and had 'some fiery discussions,' they came together sometimes in a bipartisan way. 

Lott recalled after he worked with Kennedy on an immigration bill that lost on a procedural vote in 2007, he told him, 'Ted, every time I work with you I get in trouble man.'

'But just think how different things would be now if we passed immigration reform in 2007,' he added to applause.

Kennedy's widow, Victoria Kennedy, said her late husband hoped the institute would honor the nearly 2,000 who have served there and inspire future senators. She said he wanted visitors to feel the awe of walking into the chamber.

Guests, including student groups, will be able to role-play as senators and debate some of the major issues of the day. The facility also includes a re-creation of Kennedy's Senate office, virtually unchanged from how it appeared when he died.

'He believed in the majesty of the place and its ability to inspire,' she said.

The Kennedys came out in full force on Monday to celebrate the memory of their late family member. 

Among the event's attendees were Jean Kennedy, the sister of Ted Kennedy, and former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Ted's son.

Joan Kennedy, Ted Kennedy's first wife, was also present at the event, as well as Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy - brother to Ted - and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and journalist Maria Shriver.

Shriver is a niece of the Kennedy family. Her mother, Eunice, was the sister of Ted. She died in August of 2009 just days before her younger brother.
