Derbyshire chief constable Mick Creedon said the Met's Special Demonstration Squad routinely gave officers false identities based on dead children

The use of dead children’s identities to create aliases for undercover police officers was ‘common practice’, a senior officer has admitted.

But none of the families of the children had been contacted by police, Chief Constable Mick Creedon said.

He is investigating undercover policing, including the use of dead children’s names by Scotland Yard’s Special Demonstration Squad.

Earlier this year it was claimed up to 80 identities were stolen over a  30-year period, without families knowing.

Officers used birth certificates from real people to create fake passports so that their aliases appeared genuine.

In one case, an officer infiltrating an anti-capitalist group took on the name John Barker, using the birth certificate of Philip John Barker, who died of leukaemia aged eight in 1968.

Sergeant John Dines used the identity for five years starting in 1987.

In February, Philip’s 81-year-old aunt Beryl Ramsell, said she thought it was a ‘sick joke’.

In a letter to MPs published yesterday, Mr Creedon, who is leading Operation Herne into undercover policing, said he was unable to say how many identities had been stolen.

His team of 23 officers and ten police staff has 50,000 documents yet to process.

The investigation has cost £1.25million and is expected to cost another £1.66million over the next year.

In a letter to Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, Mr Creedon said: ‘This issue is very complicated and mistakes could put lives in jeopardy.’

Asked how many dead children’s names 
had been used, he said: ‘I am not able to answer this question at this 
time with any degree of absolute certainty but I can say that this was 
common practice within the SDS. 

Former undercover cop Mark Kennedy told Channel 4 he 'devastated lives' when he took on the guise of eco protestor Mark Stone

‘No families of children whose identities have been used have been contacted and informed.’

Home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said victims must be given an apology

He added: ‘Unravelling all the complexities of this is going to take a considerable effort and not a little time.’

Operation Herne was set up in October
2011 to look into allegations made against the Met’s Special 
Demonstration Squad, including the use of dead children’s identities and
inappropriate sexual relationships.

The Derbyshire chief constable said 
it would not be appropriate to provide details on the number of children
born out of relationships with undercover officers.

Mr Vaz said: ‘With 50,000 documents 
to go through and years of undercover police operations to examine, it 
is vital that Herne does not go the way of the original phone-hacking 
investigations.

‘It is imperative that a timetable is
set for completion of the operation, and the victims informed and 
apologised to as soon as possible.’

A raft of allegations have been made 
since former PC Mark Kennedy was unmasked in 2011 as an undercover 
officer who spied on environmental protesters as Mark ‘Flash’ Stone – 
and had at least one sexual relationship with a female activist.
