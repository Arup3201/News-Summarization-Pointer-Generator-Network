A man who was handed in to a police station by a man dressed as Batman has admitted trying to cash a stolen cheque he said he found in the street.

Daniel Frayne appeared at Bradford Magistrates' Court today, nearly a fortnight after he was taken into Trafalgar House police station in the city by his friend, Stan Worby, who was dressed as the comic book hero.

Pictures of 39-year-old Mr Worby in the caped crusader's costume went round the world before his identity was eventually revealed.

The police station got a shock when Batman - also known as Stan Worby - arrived to hand in his friend almost a fortnight ago

When Mr Worby,  who unmasked himself as
a Chinese takeaway delivery driver, handed over Frayne, he calmly told 
the duty officer at the station: 'Here you are, it’s over to you now'.

Today, he accompanied Frayne to court but there was no repeat of his costumed antics.

He watched as Frayne, 27, admitted a charge of handling a stolen cheque and another of supplying a cheque with intent to commit fraud.

Magistrates heard that Frayne has 29 previous convictions relating to 49 different offences,

Frayne, of Aspen Court, Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, left court making rude gestures at waiting photographers and swearing at reporters who asked him to comment.

His case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports and he will be sentenced on April 8.

The footage had earlier caused a frenzy on the internet as viewers speculated who the superhero might be.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
