These pockmarked shells are all that's left of what their owners in Debaltseve used to call their homes.  

The strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine was stormed by Moscow-backed separatists two weeks ago in one of the most dramatic advances by the rebels since the start of the 10-month-old war.

Fighting over the city actually intensified in the days after a ceasefire deal, signed in Minsk on February 12, was meant to take effect on February 15.

Rebels who had encircled Debaltseve launched a massive assault, routing all Ukrainian forces by February 18, three days after the truce was meant to come into force.  

Nearly a week after the retreat of government forces, bodies and body parts still lie uncollected on the streets and outside the city.

A house ruined by fighting in the city of Debaltseve. The strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine was stormed by Moscow-backed separatists two weeks ago

The shelling which destroyed this house actually intensified in the days after a ceasefire deal was signed in Minsk on February 12

The battle for Debaltseve caught civilians, like those who lived here, in the crossfire on a scale not yet seen in the war that has killed nearly 6,000 people

A sofa still with cushions strewn across it is visible through a doorway of one ruined building.

In another haunting image all that's left of a house is one wall with three windows in it, glass long since blown out by the impact of shells. 

A third house is pockmarked by shrapnel, its residents having long since fled. Debaltseve used to have a population of 45,000, of whom only around 6,000 now remain. 

Sergei had the misfortune of living on the outskirts of city near the Ukrainian army's field camp which was destroyed during the attack, along with the modest one-storey brick houses lining the nearby streets.

Sergei's house was hit on February 18, right before Ukrainian forces left Debaltseve.

Asked by Reuters if he knew which side attacked his house, he replied: 'Of course, it's clear. I won't say it out loud. The other side entered and shelling stopped. Not a single shell landed after that.' 

Asked if he thought the rebels were responsible, Sergei answered: 'Of course. But I don't get it. Why did they do it?'

Kiev and Western governments have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support the separatists in east Ukraine, despite the peace deal agreed in the Belarussian capital Minsk. Moscow has denied this.

Separatist commanders said the advance at Debaltseve was necessary to 'straighten the frontline' and ease communications between their strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The battle for the city caught civilians in the crossfire on a scale not yet seen in the war that has killed nearly 6,000 people. Most residential buildings in the town have been damaged by shelling or are burnt out.

Nearly a week after the retreat of Ukrainian forces, bodies and body parts still lay uncollected on the streets and outside the city.

In neighbouring Vuhlehirsk some 10 kilometres away, conquered by the rebels before Debaltseve, smashed armoured vehicles with the insignia of the Ukrainian army are visible and there's heavy damage to almost every building in the town.

In the village of Nikishino, also near Debaltseve, the story is similar. 

Ukrainian military leaders and separatist commanders alike insist they never target residential areas. 

But rank-and-file fighters from both sides admit they used heavy weapons while fighting over the towns and could have missed targets. 

The remains of a house in Nikishino, located 20 km from Debaltseve, and abandoned by the Ukrainian military  four days ago after separatist forces attacked it for several days.

Next to the ruins of Sergei's house, a rebel gunman nicknamed Shuya was on guard at the destroyed Ukrainian camp, littered with ammunition boxes, pieces of burnt-out vehicles and unexploded shells.

'It was tanks, artillery ... I will be honest, the camp was hit very well,' he said with a smile.

Another separatist fighter, who gave his nickname as Zelya, conceded it was possible they missed targets during the attack.

'Debaltseve is in a lowland. They (the Ukrainians) put their artillery there, it was hard to hit right on target,' he said.  

The Ukrainian side also used heavy weapons, a member of a Ukrainian artillery crew, who gave his name as Nikolai, told Reuters after the retreat from Debaltseve.

'We got shelled every day, we sat in trenches ... We also fired, of course,' said the soldier who serves in the 55th brigade.

But according to his comrade who used the nickname Prapor, many areas that are now heavily damaged had been unscathed when Ukrainian forces retreated.

'We left Vuhlehirsk without any fighting... and many villages too. It should be investigated who took advantage of it,' he said.

Government troops began towing artillery away from the front line on Thursday, a sign the truce could at last be taking effect.
