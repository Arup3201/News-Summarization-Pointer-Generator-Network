Police are on alert for revenge attacks from Manchester United fans on Roma’s notorious ‘ultras’ ahead of the Italian club’s Champions League tie at the Etihad on Tuesday night.

Hundreds of officers are on duty to prevent trouble between Manchester City and Roma’s hardcore supporters, who have a history of violence and disorder around Europe.

But they are also aware that United’s troublemakers could use the occasion to seek reprisals for the violence that marred their infamous Champions League quarter-final against Roma in 2007.

Several United fans were stabbed before the first leg at the Stadio Olimpico and Italian police were accused of indiscriminately beating others in a series of baton charges.

Francisco Totti, who once again captains Roma against City on Tuesday night, later issued a public apology to one female fan who was seen on camera being attacked without provocation, while Amnesty International were among those who called for an inquiry.

Before the return leg at Old Trafford, 21 arrests were made as riot police tried to quell running battles between the two sets of fans.

Trouble flared again in Rome when the clubs met in the group stage later that year and a United fan was also stabbed before the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona in the Italian capital.

Roma’s return to Manchester has therefore raised as much concern over revenge attacks from United fans as the threat of clashes with City supporters.

As many as 200 ultras are believed to be among the 1,600 Italian fans who have come over for the game. Most of them are expected to gather in the city centre and then march to the stadium under heavy police escort and helicopter surveillance.

They were involved in clashes with CSKA Moscow fans before their opening Champions League game in Italy earlier this month and not surprisingly this match has been designated a maximum Category C with hundreds of extra police deployed on the streets of Manchester to make sure it passes off peacefully.

A spokesman said: ‘Roma supporters do come with a reputation and in 2007 when they played in Manchester we did experience some problems. However since then they have visited the city twice and there were no major issues.

‘We will continue to work with both clubs ahead of the return fixture in Roma later in the year.’
