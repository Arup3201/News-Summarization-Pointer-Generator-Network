For 200 years the iconic Natural History Museum in London has put together one of the biggest and most diverse butterfly and moth collections in the world.

And now it is putting its incredible collection on show in a special exhibition called Sensational Butterflies.

Visitors will see all stages of the butterfly life-cycle in the special enclosure. They will experience the wildly varied environments in which butterflies live in North America, Africa and Asia as well as the heart of the Amazon rainforest in South America, where there are more butterfly species than anywhere else on Earth

Butterflies develop from an egg to a caterpillar before cocooning themselves inside a pupa. They finally emerge as winged adults and set about reproducing.

However, butterflies don't survive for long as they cannot eat and can only drink through a straw-like mouth.

While this entire cycle only takes 137 days for some species like Blue Morphos, arctic butterflies are believed to have a two-year life cycle.

The exhibition, which opens on April 3, also includes two hatchery windows where butterflies will emerge from the pupae, as well as feeding tables.
