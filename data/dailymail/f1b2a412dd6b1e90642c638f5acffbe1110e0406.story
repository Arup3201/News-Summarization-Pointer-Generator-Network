An appeals panel has reversed the conviction of a man who was accused of killing the father and sister of his friend's ex-girlfriend in a fiery attack on their Orange County home. 

The three-judge panel ruled that Vitaliy Krasnoperov, 29, did not get a fair trial in 2011 when he was convicted of the murders of Jay Dhanak and his daughter Karishma.

Authorities argued Krasnoperov  plotted the murder with his friend Iftekhar Murtaza, in an ill-conceived plan to help Murtaza get his ex-girlfriend  back after she dumped him for being Muslim.

Vindicated: Vitaliy Krasnoperov is seen here before the start of his trial in Santa Ana, California, judges reversed his conviction the murder of his friend's ex-girlfriend

Attack: Vitaliy Krasnoperov was accused of  torching his friend's ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home

But appeal judges said that during the trial, prosecutors breached an agreement with Krasnoperov by using information he'd provided to authorities on the condition that it not be used against him.

Krasnoperov had been convicted of two counts of murder for the 2007 deaths of the Dhanaks and was sentenced to life without parole.

The crime was allegedly hatched after his friend, Murtaza, a Muslim, became angry that his ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak's family had opposed them dating.

Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'. 

At the time Dhanak said her Hindu parents also threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she didn't leave her Muslim boyfriend.

During his trial, Murtaza 
said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting
 with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead.

Religious differences: Iftekhar Murtaza, left, dated  Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007, but she broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued

'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech.'

'I was frustrated, I was upset,' he continued, 'I just wished they would accept me.'

'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.'

Murtaza burned down the family's Orange County home after becoming 'upset' when his then 18-year-old girlfriend dumped him. 

A pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire.

Meanwhile, autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury. 

A judge recommended the death penalty for Murtaza in December over the murders which he was convicted of carrying out with another friend, Charles Murphy Jr. 

Accomplice: Murtaza was later convicted of carrying out the killings with another friend, Charles Murphy Jr.

However in the case of Krasnoperov and Murphy, appeal judges ruled that prosecutors called a witness who they would not have known about until he was identified by Krasnoperov.

According to the judge's ruling, Krasnoperov had given this information in a proffer statement when plea negotiations were underway but the negotiations later broke down.

Krasnoperov's lawyer agreed that witness Jose Velasco could be called during the trial but was not to testify about any conversations with his client about securing a hit man to carry out the killings.

Velasco ended up discussing these conversations, in part, during questioning by Murphy's lawyer.

Michael Ian Garey, Krasnoperov's lawyer said: 'It is a vindication of Mr Krasnoperov's constitutional rights, and what happened in the trial was really quite unfair.' 

Howard Gundy, senior deputy district attorney for Orange County said it's likely that Krasnoperov will  be re-tried.
