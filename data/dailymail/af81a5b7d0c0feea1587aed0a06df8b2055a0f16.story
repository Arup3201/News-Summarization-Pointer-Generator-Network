Industry figures show Britain is losing its taste for baked beans with the amount spent on the snack falling by £21million this year

Sales in baked beans fell by more than £20million this year.

But while the figures are bad news for Heinz, they could be a sign of better things for the economy – as sales of tinned goods tend to go up when times are hard because they are cheap.

If people are buying fewer beans it suggests they could be spending on higher-grade foods.

The hot summer, compared with the gloom of 2012, may also have contributed as hot food is less of an attraction when the  temperature is soaring.

The total value of baked beans sold in the 12 months to October fell by £20.8million to £339.3million.

Sales at Heinz, which dominates the market ahead of Branston and Crosse & Blackwell, fell by £16.1million to £216million, said the study in trade journal The Grocer.

It said a lack of new product development also contributed to the fall in sales across the market.

Previous years have seen innovations such as plastic pots, new flavours and the introduction of lower salt and lower sugar versions.

Each helps to give the market a lift when introduced even if only for a limited period.

The
 Grocer's report said: 'Britain's off the beans. We've forked out £20.8 
million less on them in the past year, the biggest decline of all the 
canned food market.

'For Heinz, the £16.1 million it's haemorrhaged in lost sales in the past year far outweighs its 2012 growth of £7.4 million.'
