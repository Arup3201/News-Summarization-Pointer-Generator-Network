Lager tops and Frickley Athletic brought Blyth Spartans back to reality even before the departing TV trucks signalled the end of another FA Cup fairytale at Croft Park on Saturday night.

Captain Robbie Dale might have hoped for a bigger celebration after netting the two first-half goals which put the Evo-Stik League side on the brink of round four before a quick-fire second-half response from Championship Birmingham gave the visitors a 3-2 win.

Instead, just hours after starring on Match Of The Day, Dale was back at his job as a bar man at the Blacksmith's pub in Gosforth on Sunday morning, while Spartans boss Tom Wade was already planning for Tuesday's looming league trip to Frickley.

For lifelong Blyth fan Wade the inevitable disappointment of coming so close to a famous victory was quickly eased by his continuing focus on a job which he reluctantly accepted two years ago when the club were in dire straits.

Wade said: 'We've got Frickley on Tuesday night, but if we show the same resilience and character that we showed here today then we will be okay.

'Hopefully there will be a big crowd down there to support us again because we proved today just how much this team has got to give and the future is bright.

'I'm very proud of what we have achieved and the fact we scored two goals and dominated against a Championship side is a huge compliment to us. We have now got to get back to the league and hope to come again next year.'

Dale sent Croft Park wild with two well-taken finishes towards the end of the first half, which stirred memories of Blyth's most famous Cup run in 1978 when - watched by Wade - they eventually lost a fifth-round replay to Wrexham.

But Newcastle-born Lee Novak narrowed the deficit before two quick goals from Wes Thomas ensured Gary Rowett's Championship side wriggled out of another potential giant-killing.

Dale might have found his face plastered across Sunday morning's newspapers, but he was opening up at the Blacksmith's having failed to convince his bosses that he deserved a day off following his FA Cup exploits.

'It's back to reality on Sunday morning then away to Frickley on Tuesday,' said Dale. 'We can be proud of what we have done as a team because we have been close to going out a few times, but we managed to get to this point.

'At half-time we thought the shock was on and the aim was to keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes, but it didn't work out. In the last 20 we came again and we might have nicked something, but it wasn't to be.'
