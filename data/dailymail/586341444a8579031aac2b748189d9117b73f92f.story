Supermarkets will today be told to reduce excessive packaging within the next 12 months – or face new laws that will force them to.

Officials are understood to be examining radical options, including a legal right pioneered in Scandinavia for consumers to return plastic waste to the superstore where they bought it.

Britain produces the equivalent weight of 245 jumbo jets in packaging waste every week. Local Government Minister Grant Shapps, who is hosting today’s summit of supermarket bosses and waste experts, said the problem was particularly acute at Christmas.

At this time of year, the total potential cost to taxpayers could reach more than £168million, thanks to the price of landfill. For every ton, councils pay £56.

Around 227,000 miles of wrapping paper – enough to go round the world roughly nine times –  will be thrown away this Christmas, according to Government statistics.

Packaging for up to ten million turkeys and 25million Christmas puddings will also go in the bin. In total, enough waste will be produced to fill Big Ben 1,500 times.

The minister said supermarkets must make a significant effort to reduce their packaging by this time next year, or face Government action. He also urged shoppers to complain to retailers about pointless packaging.

‘Christmas should be a time for sharing and celebrating but every trussed up turkey, shrink-wrapped sprout and over-packaged pudding adds to the clean up cost,’ Mr Shapps said.

‘At a time when councils are watching every penny, supermarkets should be thinking about how they can help shoppers minimise their waste.

‘I want every supermarket to commit to culling packaging by this time next year. Consumers have a big interest in putting pressure on the supermarkets to reduce their packaging, since it will help reduce their tax bills.’

Too much: Sainsbury's narrowly escaped prosecution over the packaging of this Taste the Difference Roast Beef joint which had excessive wrapping

Though supermarkets have made efforts to reduce waste, campaigners point out that more rubbish goes to landfill in Britain than in any other European country.

Shoppers are routinely charged extra for buying fruit and vegetables that are wrapped in plastic rather than sold loose.

Last year Sainsbury’s narrowly escaped prosecution for using excessive wrapping on its Taste the Difference Slow Matured Ultimate Beef roasting joint, which came in a plastic shrink-wrap, placed inside a plastic tray with a plastic lid and finished with a cardboard sleeve.

Lincolnshire trading standards called off what would have been a landmark case after the store made voluntary reductions to  the packaging.
