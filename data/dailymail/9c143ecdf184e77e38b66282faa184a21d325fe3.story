David Cameron has been criticised for the ‘amazing’ omission of immigration from the top six issues on which the Conservatives will fight the forthcoming election.

Neither Britain’s borders nor the health service merited a mention in his party’s pitch to voters in May, which includes cutting the deficit, jobs, tax, education, housing and retirement.

This is despite polls consistently showing these are the two issues of greatest concern to voters, often eclipsing economic growth.

David Cameron was criticised yesterday after omitting immigration and health care from the top six issues on which the Conservatives will fight the forthcoming election 

Mr Cameron, who was addressing an audience party member in Nottingham yesterday, claimed it was not an oversight but would be addressed as part his offer on jobs and the economy.

In a long-awaited immigration speech last November, Mr Cameron announced that migrants would have to work in the UK for four years before being eligible for state benefits – up from three months – under a future Conservative government.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said immigration was part of his pitch that Britain ‘should live within her means’ and that the public could expect more detailed plans in the coming months.

‘These areas I am talking about are very directly related to people’s concerns about their lives and their security’, he said when asked about leaving it out.

‘It’s about people’s jobs, people’s taxes, the homes they want to buy, the schools they want to send their children to, and their retirement. Through this prism we will address every single issue.’

He said he had already set out ‘the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country’ to tackle European immigration through curbs on access to benefits.

Immigration is one of the areas in which the Prime Minister plans to push for further reforms as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union, if he wins a second term.

It is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the EU will be blocked by German chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured here) and others

But his party are under pressure for failing to deliver on their pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, with the latest figures showing it had leapt to 260,000.

And it is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the EU will be blocked by German chancellor Angela Merkel and others.

In his pre-election speech about jobs - in which he may elaborate on George Osborne’s pledge to create full employment - he will lay out ‘exactly how we will deal with this issue of immigration’, he said.

However Lord Green of Deddington, the head of the think tank MigrationWatch said the omission of it from his priorities was ‘amazing’.

FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:

No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years

No social housing for four years

No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK

FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:

No support from the UK taxpayer

Deportation if they do not get a job for six months

Other measures include:

Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU

Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK

Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals

Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels

He said yesterday: ‘Immigration has now come top equal with the economy the past six months among the issues the public are most concerned with. 

'It is amazing that the Conservative Party have not included it in their top six issues for the election campaign.’

Mr Cameron also insisted that the NHS was ‘at the heart of this commitment for Britain to live within her means’. Ed Miliband seized on its absence from the list yesterday saying it was the subject that ‘dare not speak its’ name’.

The Prime Minister said his party had protected the NHS budget, while making cuts elsewhere, over the last five years and would make the same commitment for the next Parliament.

‘Not a penny will be cut from the NHS budget - instead it will carry on rising,’ he said.

‘I am a father, a son and a husband who has relied on the NHS many times.

‘When you are sick, when your loved ones are ill, when you feel at your most vulnerable, you need to know the NHS is there. That is why we are making this commitment.

‘That is the right thing to do for the sick, the frail and the vulnerable in our country. And the right thing for the NHS long-term is to get Britain back to living within its means.’

Last night a ComRes poll for ITV News put ‘managing the NHS’ as voters top concern – overtaking ‘controlling immigration’ for the first time in six months.

Half of British people now list the health service as one of their top three priorities, compared with only 39 per cent last months. Immigration is a top three concern for 46pc of voters.

Third on the list, chosen by 25 per cent of people, was ‘keeping down the cost of everyday items, such as food, energy and travel’ and fourth was ‘promoting economic growth.’
