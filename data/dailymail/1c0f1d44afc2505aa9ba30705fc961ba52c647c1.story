Louise Whitaker lost 9st but was left with huge saggy breasts resembling 'coal sacks' (pictured)

After losing a staggering nine stone, Louise Whitaker expected to be brimming with confidence.

But her joy at dropping four dress sizes and shrinking from a 22 to a size 14 was shattered every time she caught sight of her chest in the mirror.

The 41-year-old said despite shedding the weight she was left with huge saggy breasts resembling 'coal sacks'.

She said she regularly had to 'tuck in' her 48EE breasts, leaving her feeling more embarrassed of her body than ever before. 

After being denied a reduction operation on the NHS because her body mass index still deemed her to be obese, the support worker turned to a private clinic in desperation.

And today, after having half her breast tissue removed in a three-hour operation, Ms Whittaker said she feels as though she has been freed.

She said: ' I absolutely hated my breasts. They were like giant coal sacks and I spent all my time trying to tuck them into place to stop them escaping from my bra.

'I was very self conscious, not to mention the back pain they caused.'

But she was rejected from the NHS waiting list for a breast reduction because after losing weight her BMI crept back up to a fraction over the 30 limit - at which point a person is thought to be obese.

Ms Whitaker has three children aged 20, 17 and 14 and lives in Bradford, said: 'I was on the waiting list for a reduction for two and a half years after I lost weight then one day I got a call telling me I would have to come off it because of my BMI.

'I was disappointed because this was not a cosmetic issue and because I felt my BMI was only just over because of all the excess weight I was carrying on my bust.'

She was estimated to be carrying at least 6lbs in breast tissue and without it her BMI would have fallen into the healthy range.

But as her marriage broke down Ms Whittaker felt unable to contemplate her future as a single woman without addressing the confidence issues that stemmed from her bust.

She said: 'I felt so much more healthy, happier and confident in every way thanks to my diet but my coal sack breasts were running everything because there was nothing I could do to change them.

'No amount of exercise in the gym made any difference. And swimming, running, anything like that was impossible due to the sheer size and weight of them.' 

Eventually seeing how distraught she was her parents helped her fund private surgery with Transform.

She said: ' I felt weird going for the consultation because to me this was not cosmetic surgery, this was absolutely necessary.'

Surgeons agreed her health and confidence would benefit from an uplift and reduction combined.

She underwent the £5,800 operation in September 2013 at the Transform Hospital in Manchester.

Her bust was reduced to a more manageable 40D thanks to the removal of half of her breast tissue.

Ms Whitaker said: ' I just lifted the bed sheet and said "wow". I couldn't believe the coal sacks had finally gone. I was over the moon to see the back of them.

'The surgeon was amazing and really did a wonderful job.'

After the reduction last year she says she felt less back pain and her confidence blossomed.

She said: 'People think large breasts are a blessing but they can be a curse.

'I'm delighted to see the back of them. Finally I can walk tall.'

Shami Thomas, spokeswoman from Transform Cosmetic Surgery said, 'Breast reductions are one of the most life changing procedures we offer here at Transform.

'The vast majority of patients see a significant improvement in their quality of life post op. 

'We hear patients talking of how much easier it is for them to exercise post op - going swimming, running, attending exercise classes are some of the activities patients are now able to take up which they would have struggled with before.

'We've seen a steady year on year increase in the numbers of women enquiring about breast reductions - between 2013 and 2014, 22 per cent up from the year before.

'It's great to hear about the positive effect it's had on this patient's life.'
