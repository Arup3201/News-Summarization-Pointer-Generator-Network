A litter of puppies less than a week old have been rescued after they were thrown in a trash can at a Colorado park and left to die.

A walker in Highland Heritage Park, Douglas County, rushed four of the puppies to safety after finding them shivering in a bin outside a restroom, but a fifth one had already succumbed to the cold.

'He heard what sounded like some puppies whimpering or crying,' Joe Stafford, director of Douglas County Animal Law Enforcement said.

Abandoned: These week-old puppies were dumped in a trash can in a Colorado park

Animal enforcement officers are now trying to find the person responsible for abandoning the defenseless creatures, who are being treated for cold.

'This is a senseless act of animal 
cruelty, and we are hopeful that the public will help bring the 
individual responsible for this crime to justice,' Sgt Erica 
Dalton said.

Mr Stafford believes the puppies were abandoned between 10am and 3pm on Tuesday, saying that the low overnight temperatures would have killed them.

'They were very cold and not doing so well,' he told ABC7.

When the litter was taken to a vet they were found to be suffering from low body temperature. And, although they have survived  their ordeal, their future is uncertain.

At seven days old, the puppies would have been blind and completely dependent on their mother for milk, warmth and cleaning.

Although their hearing would be starting to develop, the dogs would not be able to walk properly. Usually puppies are not separated from their mothers until they are at least eight weeks old.

The mother of the abandoned litter is also likely to be suffering from anxiety at the loss of her puppies.

The litter is being cared for by a foster owner, who will need to feed them every couple of hours.

'It never ceases to amaze me how someone
could literally take a creature that is helpless for itself, and do 
something this heinous,' Mr Stafford said.

He hopes the public will help them find the person responsible, who could be charged with a felony offense.

The owner could face felony charges for abandoning the dogs.

Animal enforcement officers are also keen to hear from anyone who knows of a dog who recently has a litter that gone missing.
