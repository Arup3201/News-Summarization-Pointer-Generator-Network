Harry Redknapp fought back tears in court today as he fiercely denied telling his tax evasion trial 'a pack of lies'.

The football boss shouted from the witness box at prosecutor John Black QC: 'You think I put my hand on the bible and told lies? That's an insult, Mr Black, that's an insult.'

Bespectacled Redknapp shook his head as Mr Black ended his cross-examination at Southwark Crown Court, in London, by saying: 'I suggest you have been telling the court a pack of lies.'

With a voice trembling with emotion, Redknapp replied: 'Everything I have told you is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.'

On trial: Harry Redknapp, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court with his son Jamie today, has admitted 'plucking the wrong figure' out of the air as he was quizzed by Premier League bung investigators

Earlier in the day, the football boss
admitted he 'plucked the wrong figure' out of the air as he was quizzed
by Premier League bung investigators.

The Tottenham Hotspur manager denied 
prosecution claims he 'desperately' tried to cover up allegations that 
£189,000 payments into a Monaco bank account were bonuses for transfer 
profits.#

Redknapp told the court: 'I wasn’t sure what the sum 
was,' when he first mentioned the account to Quest Premier 
League bung investigators.

When asked if he plucked a figure out of the air, Redknapp replied: 'I did and I plucked the wrong figure, didn’t I?'

He said that if he had not told the Quest inquiry about the Monaco account the issue would be 'dead'.

Other football managers did not voluntarily declare accounts, he told the jury.

Redknapp said: 'As I have said many times, if I don't go to Quest and tell them about that account, nobody knows.'

The 2006 Quest investigation into English football was led by Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

'Half the managers didn't even tell them,' Redknapp said. 'If I didn't tell them it's dead.'

On the stand for a second day, 
Redknapp also revealed that he deliberately gave News of the World 
sports journalist Rob Beasley the wrong information to prevent a story 
appearing in the Sunday tabloid on the day Spurs were to take on 
Manchester United in the 2009 League Cup final.

He
said: 'I don’t have to tell Mr Beasley the truth. I have to tell police
the truth, not Mr Beasley, he’s a News of the World reporter.'

When asked why he referred to payments he was due for the sale of striker Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa as bonuses, Redknapp added: 'I wanted to make the point to Mr Beasley that it was paid by my chairman.'

He added: 'I referred to it to him many times as my Crouch bonus [as] Crouch is an easy answer.'

Redknapp added: 'I just want to get Mr Beasley out the way - I just didn’t want a story in the paper...

'I was going to come down to breakfast and all my players were going to be looking at the back page of the News of the World. It was going to be embarrassing.'

Redknapp said 'I am not a liar' but giving Mr Beasley the wrong information was 'the easy way out'.

John Black QC, for the prosecution, accused Redknapp of 'letting the cat out of the bag' during the phone conversation.

Redknapp replied: 'Why would I let the cat out of the bag to the News of the World if I had done anything wrong?

'Do you think me and Mr (Milan) Mandaric are going to have completely different stories. Are we that stupid?'

When asked again why he had offered a
'false story' to Mr Beasley, Redknapp, wearing tortoise-shell glasses 
and a navy blue suit, added: 'I just want to get him off my back. This 
is the easy way out for me before a Cup Final.'

The payments were linked to Crouch 'in my mind', Redknapp added.

'In my mind it was always related to Crouch even though it wasn’t connected.

'I felt morally I was due that money even though legally I wasn’t.'

Tape recordings of Redknapp talking to Mr Beasley were played in court.

Mr Black focused on Redknapp saying, 'Well, what did he give it to me for then?' when Mr Beasley said Mandaric claimed the payments were an investment, not a bonus.

Mr Black asked earlier if Redknapp was 'desperately trying to hide' that it was a bonus.

Redknapp replied: 'Absolutely not.'

When asked if he had been misleading, Redknapp repeated: 'Absolutely not.'

He went on to say: 'You could be under the illusion (it was a bonus) but you would be wrong.'

The defendant was asked about the £300,000 he received outside his contract at West Ham United for the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United.

When asked whether responsibility for paying the tax was the club’s, Redknapp replied: 'Yes.'

Both former Portsmouth boss Redknapp, of Dorset, and Mandaric, 73, of Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public revenue.
