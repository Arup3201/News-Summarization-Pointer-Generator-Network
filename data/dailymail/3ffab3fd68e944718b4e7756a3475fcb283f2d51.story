Internet trolls who post one-off offensive messages may escape criminal charges, the country’s chief prosecutor announced yesterday.

Keir Starmer said court action would be taken only where there was a ‘sustained campaign of  harassment’ or a direct threat, as he stressed the need to protect free speech.

The Director of Public Prosecutions made his comments as he announced that a semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic diver Tom Daley would not face criminal charges.

He said the comments were not so ‘grossly offensive’ that they should lead to a prosecution.

Daniel Thomas sent the message about Daley, 18, and diving partner Peter Waterfield, 31, after the pair missed out on a medal on July 30.

Thomas, who plays for Welsh side Port Talbot Town, was arrested after the tweet spread around the internet. It falsely suggested that Daley and Waterfield were in a gay relationship and drew a link between homosexuality and HIV.

Under the 2003 Communications Act, it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive.

The popularity of social networking sites has raised concerns that police will be swamped by similar cases.

Last year officers dealt with 14,000 cases of abuse on Facebook alone.  Mr Starmer said new guidelines will be drawn up to deal with such abuse.

He indicated that in future, Twitter trolls could face some other sanction short of criminal prosecution, which should be used only in extreme cases. This could include a police caution or a fixed penalty notice.

He also suggested a greater role for social networking sites in moderating comments and cracking down on users who post deeply offensive messages.

He said: ‘Social media is a new and emerging phenomenon, raising difficult issues of principle, which have to be confronted not only by prosecutors but also by others including the police, the courts and service providers.

‘The fact that offensive remarks may not warrant a full criminal prosecution does not necessarily mean that no action should  be taken.’ 

Mr Starmer accepted Thomas’s tweet was ‘homophobic’ but said it had been a misguided attempt at humour.

The message was also not intended to go beyond his Twitter followers, who were mainly friends and family. And he said the message was quickly taken down and the footballer had apologised.

Prosecutors contacted the two divers and both said they did not want a prosecution.

Mr Starmer said: ‘This was, in essence, a one-off offensive Twitter message, intended for family and friends, which made its way into the public domain.

‘It was not intended to reach  Mr Daley or Mr Waterfield, it was not part of a campaign, it was  not intended to incite others  and Mr Thomas removed it  reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse.

‘Before reaching a final decision in this case, Mr Daley and Mr Waterfield were consulted by the CPS and both indicated that they did not think this case needed a prosecution.’

On the same day Thomas posted his message, Daley was also the subject of trolling by a 17-year-old boy who posted abusive and threatening messages on Twitter.

Teenager Reece Messer, from Weymouth, Dorset, was arrested after he tweeted: ‘You let your dad down. I hope you know that.’

Daley’s father, Rob, died of a brain tumour last year.

Daley, who went on to win bronze in the individual 10m diving competition, retweeted the message to his followers on the site with the comment: ‘After giving it my all . . . you get idiots sending me this.’

Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the diver but apologised when his messages provoked a storm of outrage.

He was later given a police caution for harassment.

Chief Constable Andy Trotter, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the new guidance would help police to focus on the most serious online abuse.
