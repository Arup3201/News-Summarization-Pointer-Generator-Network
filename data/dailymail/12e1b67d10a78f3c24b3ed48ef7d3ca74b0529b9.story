Rafael Nadal appears to have got over his Wimbledon woe after being photographed enjoying a romantic day with his girlfriend Xisca Perello.

The Spaniard suffered a shock fourth round exit to Australian Nick Kyrgios at SW19 earlier this month, losing his world number one ranking to rival Novak Djokovic after the Serb claimed the grass-court title.

However, life off-the-court seems a lot better at present for Nadal as he put on an amorous display with Perello as they soaked up the sun on a luxurious boat in Ibiza, Spain on Sunday.

Smitten! Rafael Nadal cuddles up to girlfriend Xisca Perello during a day out  in Ibiza, Spain on Sunday

Affectionate: The pair have been dating for over eight years but are more in love than ever 

In between ocean dips and sunbathing sessions, Nadal showered his girlfriend with kisses and cuddles.

The 28-year-old showed off his elite athlete figure in a pair of salmon-coloured board shorts while Xisca slipped into a white bikini with frilly details. 

Following her dip Perello enjoyed an al fresco shower, layering up in soapy suds to wash away the sea water.

Nadal began dating Perello in 2005 after they grew up together in their hometown of Palma de Majorca on the coast of Spain.

In 2011 the tennis star  told Harper's Bazaar about his deep love for Perello.'She is a lovely person, I feel great with her and [she] is probably the woman of my life,' he said.

Drying off... Rafa wrapped a fluffy towel around him post-dip 

Indeed, the stunning brunette has shunned the spotlight instead studying Business and English in London.

Pedro Hernadez, who is a friend of the couple, recently revealed: 'They are not at all interested in a celebrity lifestyle. They get together when the tournaments are over. That’s how Raf winds down.'

No doubt the Spaniard was in dire need of a holiday following his surprise Wimbledon exit.

Ready for the next adventure: Later on in the day Perello covered up in a red sun hat 

However, it’s not all bad news for the bandanna-wearing ace, as he’s just secured a place for the end-of-season Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London in November.

Held at the O2 arena the competition sees the top eight players from the year go head-to-head.

When it comes to his downtime Nadal told Harper's Bazaar he's all about the simple things in life. 

'I like to go fishing, waking up early and going with a boat to the middle of the sea. I enjoy going out for dinner with friends and then to the local bars. In my home town I can do this,' he told the publication.   

Lunch time: The couple and their friends lounged about on the boat
