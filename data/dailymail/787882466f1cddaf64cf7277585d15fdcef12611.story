Conservative MP Nadine Dorries is paying her daughter a salary of up to £39,999 to work as her office manager, it emerged today.

Philippa Dorries, 27, has been put on the public payroll while studying for a degree at London's BPP Law School.

The revelation has re-ignited the row over MPs employing relatives, which flared up following the case of former Tory Derek Conway, who was paying his sons, but offered little evidence they worked for him.

According to The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs' pay and allowances, Philippa is listed as earning between £35,000 and £39,999.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'All the information has been on our website for about a year. It's all part of being transparent.'

The spokesman said there was 'no suggestion' Phillipa was not doing the job, and said he was unable to reveal how many hours she is working or her precise income as it was only listed within a £5,000 income bracket.

Mrs Dorries, the member for mid-Bedfordshire, revealed on Twitter that her daughter is only paid the hours she works.

This morning she wrote that for the last two years her daughter had been working part-time at home with reduced pay because of her reduced hours. She said she had informed the IPSA.

MPs from outside the capital are allowed to claim up to £137,200 a year of taxpayers’ cash for staffing costs.

But campaign groups have urged the MP to be open about the payments and claimed it showed the disclosure rules should got further.

Disgraced: Tory MP Derek Conway was thrown out of the Conservative party after a probe found 'no record' of what work his son had done for him while paying him a £1,000-a-month salary

'The expenses scandal rocked the public's trust in politicians, so it’s right that all MPs should have to account for how they spend taxpayer-funded allowances,' Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance told MailOnline.

'This is especially important when that cash is being paid to family members working for them.'

Mr Conway, who was a Tory MP at the time, employed his son Freddie as a political researcher while he was a full-time student at Newcastle University, but a probe found 'no record' of what work he had done for his £1,000-plus a month salary.

His father was suspended from Parliament for 10 days, ordered to repay £13,000 and was thrown out of the party.

The number of MPs’ employing relatives has actually increased since the expenses scandal from 106 in 2008 to 124 last November.
