First picture: PC Toby rowland on duty in Downing Street

The Plebgate row exploded again 
yesterday when a former policeman insisted one of his   colleagues was 
called a ‘f****** pleb’ by  Andrew Mitchell.

Ian
 Richardson, 50, was one of four officers on duty at the gates of 
Downing Street when Mr Mitchell had the notorious run-in which cost him 
his job as Chief Whip.

The 
constable retired from the Met a month later but broke his silence 
yesterday to back the version of events given by PC Toby Rowland.

Mr Richardson said Mr Mitchell was 
‘officious and rude’ to his colleague but added that the Police 
Federation had hijacked the affair for its own ends.

He
 was ‘sad’ the Tory MP lost his Cabinet job over a ‘quirky incident that
 should have blown over’. The former PC, who served for 30 years, 
claimed that Downing Street officers were ‘betrayed’ by their Met 
bosses.

The latest twist in
 the saga came as the first picture emerged of PC Rowland on duty in 
Downing Street since the scandal broke in September 2012.

It
 was taken at the rear entrance last month as the  popular officer, who 
was not disciplined or charged over the affair, searched a car. Mr 
Mitchell was accused of abusing PC Rowland, 43, after officers refused 
to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street and asked him 
to use a side gate.

In a 
newspaper interview, Mr Richardson condemned the Police Federation for 
whipping up the case against Mr Mitchell, whom he felt was treated ‘like
 tethered prey’ as he was forced to resign.

He
 also said the officers at the gate were undermined by colleagues in the
 Diplomatic Protection Group, who leaked the log of the incident, and by
 PC Keith Wallis. He was jailed last week for 12 months for lying about 
witnessing the incident.

A police officer who witnessed the notorious Plebgate affair in Downing Street has accused the Police Federation of hijacking the incident for its own political ends.

Mr Richardson denied any of the four policemen at the gate were involved in any sort of conspiracy against Mr Mitchell.

He
 also accused Met chiefs of failing officers by focusing on who leaked 
the story instead of clarifying the incident and investigating what 
happened.

The former 
constable was the first person to speak to  PC Rowland after the 
incident although he did not actually hear the exchange, he has given three witness statements to Operation Alice, the inquiry into the affair.

Mr
 Richardson said that PC Rowland immediately recounted what was 
allegedly said and that he had warned Mr Mitchell that the MP could be 
arrested.

The senior Tory 
has conceded swearing in the presence of officers but vehemently denies 
using the other words attributed to him. He maintains he was stitched up
 by police, whom he claims lied in logs.

Giving
 support to PC Rowland, Mr Richardson told The Times: ‘Not for one 
second did I think “he’s making this up”. He repeated to us those exact 
phrases that were to become the focus of their exchange: the swearing, 
the insults and the threat that we “hadn’t heard the last of this”.’

Mr
 Richardson said that when Police Federation officials began to condemn 
Mr Mitchell, he pleaded with senior officers to put the record straight.
 But he claims he was told his views were ‘of no interest to anyone’.

Mr Richardson, 50, said he believed that Mr Mitchell did call the officers 'f****** plebs', as was claimed in the police log, but did not deserve to lose his job over the affair.

Friends
 of Mr Mitchell rallied to his defence. Former shadow home secretary 
David Davis said it was clear that Mr Richardson was unable to 
substantiate PC Rowland’s account.

He said: ‘The gaping hole in PC Rowland’s evidence is it’s impossible to have a 40-word conversation in six seconds.’

Another
 ally said: ‘The critical point is that he admits he didn’t hear what 
was said. To call this account “the truth” is completely misleading.’

Mr
 Richardson’s claims will stoke up pressure on the Police Federation, 
whose structure, finances and running will be debated by MPs today.

This week, it emerged that whistleblower Fiona McElroy was sacked after challenging rampant spending at the organisation.

The former senior Whitehall civil servant is said to have asked ‘difficult questions’.

Mr Mitchell and Mr Richardson both declined to comment further yesterday.

An earlier version of this article's headline has been amended to further clarify that the PC in question did not overhear Mr Mitchell's conversation.
