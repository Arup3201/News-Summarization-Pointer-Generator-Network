A German nymphomaniac arrested earlier this
year after imprisoning men for punishing sex ordeals has been found dead at her
home in Munich.

Antje
Crapnik, 47, hit the headlines when she reduced men to gibbering wrecks after locking them in her home.

The woman's first victim complained that she forced him to sexually perform
eight times before he finally escaped via her balcony wearing his underwear.

Another victim, an African man, aged 36, was found
weeping in the street outside her home after an ordeal lasting 36 hours.

Imprisoned: Antje Crapnik, 47, was found dead by her latest lover at her home in Munich. She was arrested earlier this year for imprisoning men for lengthy sex ordeals

Recalling his encounter with Miss Crapnik, the man said: 'I met her on a bus. She invited me back here. Oh God, it was hell. I can't walk. Please help me.'

She was
found lying dead next to her latest and last lover in her bed on Friday. 

The man, who was Miss Crapnik's neighbour, rang police to report her death when he woke up to
find her lifeless beside him.

He said: 'I knew something was wrong because usually she wanted it first thing in the morning.'

An
autopsy will determine what the cause of death was - and whether her insatiable
sex drive had anything to do with it.

Her last lover said to police that she had 'been
hitting the wine' before they retired to her room on Thursday night and that she had snorted a drug.

Miss Crapnik, dubbed the woman who could not say 'nein', formerly owned a fashion store before her sex drive forced
her into poverty and on to welfare.

She told social workers she needed
sex up to ten times a day, every day.

Antje's mother told Germany's Bild newspaper: 'She
was a sick person.' 

She spoke with her mother the night before she died.  Her
daughter complained that 2012 was a terrible year and that next year 'would be better'.

Her first victim Dieter Schulz, 43, met her in a bar in
the centre of his home city. She took him back to her apartment and they had
sex several times.

But when the woman demanded more, the exhausted man said
no. A police spokesman said: 'He complied with the woman's wishes another few
times so he could finally leave the apartment.

'But when she continued to refuse and demanded even more
sex from him, he fled to the balcony.'  Schulz phoned police and pleaded
for assistance.

'You have got to help me,' he told them. 'She is trying
to kill me with sex. I cannot get out - and I cannot go on!'

When police arrived to question the woman and free Schulz
she invited two officers to join her in bed for a 'quickie', but they declined.

She was taken for evaluation at a psychiatric hospital following the arrest.
