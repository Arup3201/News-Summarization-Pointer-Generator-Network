As the band churned out the familiar air, Wayne Rooney’s mouth formed a string of stilted, half-remembered phrases: ‘Send her victorious / Happy and glorious…’ The television director lingered on the close-up, searching for signs of patriotic fervour. Rooney simply frowned and mumbled on. Given the choice, he would surely have remained silent, since that is his preference. But he hadn’t been given the choice.

Roy Hodgson had insisted prior to the match against Ecuador that his players sing the National Anthem very loudly, in order to demonstrate that they are ‘proud and happy’ to wear the shirt. It was a fatuous gesture designed to win a tub-thumping headline and a younger, more confident Rooney might have ignored the demand. But these days he senses his England place is in the balance, so obedience was the prudent course. It all seemed dreadfully unfair.

The principle involved is self-evident. We have the good fortune to live in a robust democracy that respects our right to remain silent when the anthem is played. Clearly, it is not our most significant liberty but it is one we should not lightly surrender. Gary Neville, the England coach, would appear to share that view, since he declined to sing the anthem in each of his 85 international appearances. Yet here we had Hodgson denying that elementary freedom to Rooney and the others. It shone a worrying light upon the manager’s current state of mind.

In full cry: Wayne Rooney (right) toed the National Anthem line but did not appear comfortable

Edict: Roy Hodgson told his players to sing the National Anthem

The cliche insists that the England job drives them all mad in the end. It isn’t true but I can think of three or four who were just a stride or two ahead of the men in white coats before their term was over. Yet the present manager has always seemed immune to such pressures. This is partly due to the range of his managerial experience — which includes four international teams and four Premier League clubs — but still more to his personality. For Hodgson has a hinterland. This is not merely a matter of theatre, galleries and modern American novels but an abiding sense that his love for the game falls comfortably short of obsession; that he understands how the world works outside football. After the past fractious week or so, we are less certain.

At this stage of affairs, the phoney war, Hodgson finds himself giving a whole string of media conferences, despite having little to impart. His predecessors coped in their own, idiosyncratic fashion; from Fabio Capello, who said little since he mistrusted his English, way back to Sir Alf Ramsey, who said even less since he mistrusted his audience. But Hodgson has always possessed the ability to fill reporters’ notebooks with a stream of reassuring platitudes.

With the anthem misjudgment and the consequent embarrassment to Rooney, his assurance suddenly appears a good deal less serene. That impression is enhanced by the maladroit manner in which he dealt with Ross Barkley’s display against Ecuador.

A constant menace: Ross Barkley shows flashes of brilliance during his cameo against Ecuador

In seeking to spare the youngster the burden of excessive praise, he tilted the balance too far. ‘He’s got to learn when to release the ball… For every good turn, there was a time when he lost the ball,’ he said. He sounded almost curmudgeonly. In normal times, he would have  handled it with ease. But these pressurised days are quite different and, for a moment, he seemed to be floundering.

Now, trivial though it may seem, this actually matters because Hodgson matters. For the next few weeks, the manager of the England football team will become the most scrutinised individual in our public life. His moods will be interpreted, his utterances diligently analysed. Failure, in terms of a premature departure, will attract rancorous attacks. These will be led by the small tribe of armchair warriors who opposed his appointment, resent his indifference to their opinions and have spent these past two years willing him to stumble. The public at large, whose irrational expectations seem to be growing by the day, may be no less hostile.

But if he should succeed…? It would represent a miracle, of course; a squad selected from less than a third of his nation’s bloated Premier League, a team skilfully fished from a pitifully shallow pool of talent. The rewards would include an open-top bus ride, an automatic knighthood and the guarantee of immortality. We may be sure that the unthinkable has crossed his mind.

Relax: Leave England to the football and they will reap the rewards

The likelihood is that his fate will settle somewhere between the two, with honourable elimination the reward for his endeavours. But such matters are beyond a manager’s control and the realisation is proving unsettling. And so, in his desperation to affect events, he creates a distracting drama from a populist gesture. And all before a ball has been kicked.

One day, when he reflects on the World Cup of 2014, Hodgson will look back on his decision and wonder: ‘Was it really worth the fuss?’ I suspect I know what his answer will be.

Meanwhile, a young man with a mass of anxieties flooding his mind will stand in line, mumbling patriotic platitudes, aware of his duty to appear ‘proud and happy’. While the rest of the world gets on with the football.

Winning is everything, second is nowhere: that’s the line which sports people tend to recite when they want to appear mean and grimly purposeful.

But it isn’t always true and this was a case in point. Eden Park, Auckland, can be a tricky place for international rugby teams to visit. So tricky, in fact, that New Zealand hadn’t lost there for 20 years and 31 Test matches.

Yet England, whose chances were rated as lowly as 25-1 in some quarters, got within two heartbreaking minutes of a thoroughly deserved draw.

Deep breath now: Chris Robshaw cannot fail to hide his pain as England concede a crucial late try

This was an England side, remember, who were missing around half of their first choices through injury and fixture chaos. A side, moreover, who played most of the final 10 minutes with 14 men. In such circumstances, survival without disgrace tends to be the highest ambition. But England were braver and bolder. They went for victory, for a shuddering upset; and on a luckier day they might have landed it.

Of course, the All Blacks will be sharper next week; indeed, they might even inflict a degree of damage. But Stuart Lancaster’s England have made their statement, they have demonstrated their desire to compete and they know that a narrow defeat in Eden Park is worth a dozen cheap victories over some of the weaker Six Nations teams.

In short, they have succeeded in sharpening the appetite for next year’s Rugby World Cup. Which goes to show what an honourable second place can achieve.

Mike Ingham is old school. He does not answer to a laddish nickname, indulge in blokeish banter or crave the company of bumptious celebs.

Instead, he fulfils his role as BBC football correspondent with grace and flair and an understated eloquence.

He has held the job since 1991, explaining and informing, painting pictures on the mind, never coming between the event and the radio audience.

The voice: Mike Ingham (right, alongside fellow BBC stalwart Alan Green in 2006) brings dignity to the airwaves

He stands alongside such fabled figures as Peter Jones and Bryon Butler as a master of his medium. Ingham is stepping down from the role of chief football correspondent at the end of this World Cup.

And radio sport will lose a gently memorable voice.
