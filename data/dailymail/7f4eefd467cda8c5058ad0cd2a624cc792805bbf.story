An Eastern Washington University faculty member who grew up in Virginia and has always been fascinated with Thomas Jefferson is building a home that looks like Jefferson’s Monticello.

Dan Sisson has spent more than a dozen years working on what he calls 'Monticello West'.

The Spokesman-Review reports Sisson is using reclaimed materials such as salvaged bricks.

The home sits on land near Ford between state property and the Spokane Indian Reservation. 

Lifelong dream: Eastern Washington University faculty member Dan Sisson grew up in Charlottesville near the Montecillo, and has been building his own in Ford, Washington, since the early 1990s

Construction is about three-quarters complete.

Sisson grew up about an hour from Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia.

'We used to go and have the whole place to ourselves, just wandering, and I fell in love with it,' he told The Spokesman-Review. 

Jefferson, America's third president, started building Monticello - which means 'little mount' in Italian - when he was 26 years old after inheriting the land from his father.

Slaves worked the 5,000 acres of land farming tobacco and other crops. 

His design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture.

Throughout his presidency, he adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe.

Jefferson was buried on the grounds, which is now owned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.

Sisson, while always wanting to build a replica, saw his plan naturally get in motion in the early 1990's while working as the manager of a Forest Service recreation area near Bend, Oregon. 

He became friends with employees of the Pozzi Window Co., a business in Bend, and they offered him windows from their yard at $50 a piece.

He then happened upon a pickup truck load of marble for $300.

'At that point you can't turn back,' Sisson said.

After buying the land in East Washington, he was given 63,000 free bricks from the owner of an antique business in Spokane, which he hauled home '250 bricks at a time for years'.

When it came time to the build the iconic dome that sits atop the Monticello, Sisson was quoted $55,000.

However, in a major stroke of luck, he got in contact with a Spokane doctor who had heard about his project.

The doctor offered to build the dome for him, and did so in his garage in one winter.

It cost Sisson $1,650. 

But there is still much work to be done.

Many of the inside rooms are not finished and there is brick work to complete on the exterior.

'Jefferson took 43 years to finish his house,' Sisson said. 

'I’m never going to be done.'

Sisson is not the first to replicate the Monticello, although his will surely be the cheapest.

Another replica: This is a brick-for-brick replica in Somers, Connecticut, of Thomas Jefferson's neoclassical Monticello, that was recently listed for $6.5 million

Architect S Prestley Blake referred to the Charlottesville, Virginia, home as 'the country's most architecturally beautiful residence'

S Prestley Blake, co-founder of Friendly's ice cream parlor and an amateur architect, undertook his own replication as a 'swan song' in the run-up to his 100th birthday.

Construction began on the Somers, Connecticut, replica in the summer of 2013, after Blake purchased the ten-acre property, which connects to his own 80-acre property by a wooded horse trail.

He tore down the church and home that existed on the land.

The brick-for-brick replica was recently listed for sale at $6,500,000.
