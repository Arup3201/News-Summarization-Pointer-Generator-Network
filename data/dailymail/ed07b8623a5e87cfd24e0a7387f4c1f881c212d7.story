The family of an American-born beautician found stabbed to death at her family home have spoken of their grief days as her husband faces court, charged with her murder.

The sister of Janee Parsons, 31, said a ‘piece of me died’ the day she died, while her biological father said he was left with a ‘tremendous hole’ in his heart.

Mother-of-two Mrs Parsons died from multiple stab wounds and was discovered by police after they were called to her detached home in Bicester, Oxfordshire on Saturday.

'Piece of me died': The family of American-born Janee Parsons (right with husband Andrew), have spoken of their grief days after Andrew faced court charged with her stabbing murder

Her husband, 38-year-old Andrew Parsons, was found in their rented house with his severely injured wife after neighbours heard chilling screams and dialled 999.

He was remanded in custody after being charged with murder this week.

Parsons will appear at Oxford Crown Court on February 11 when he is expected to enter a plea to the charge.

Today the mother of Texan-born Mrs Parsons, who had two boys aged five and eight, said she was a ‘great gift from God’ who would be deeply missed.

Mary Brady said in a statement issued through Thames Valley Police: ‘Janee made me laugh and cry and was one of the brightest lights in my life.

‘She was a wonderful mother and was a tireless worker. I will deeply miss her and cherish her as the great gift from God that she was.’

'Great gift from God': Mother Mary Brady said Mrs Parsons was a 'wonderful mother' and a 'tireless worker'

Mrs Brady said that from the age of 
three, her daughter had big aspirations, adding: ‘She always wanted to 
be the best and smartest at everything she did.

‘She very rarely took no for an answer and her attention to detail was easily seen through her children and her career.’

Phil Brady, Mrs Parsons’ adopted father, said: ‘Janee left a huge impact on everyone she met, whether an acquaintance or myself - her father for 27 years.

‘There will never be a day in my life that Janee will not be missed.’

John Jacks, her biological father, said: ‘She was a child who never disappointed me and was very honest and loyal. I now have a tremendous hole in my heart.’

Muder probe: Police sealed off the house in Bicester where Mrs Parsons' body was found

Mrs Parsons’ sister, Jocelyn Brady, described her as ‘passionate, vivacious and magnetic’.

She added: ‘To say that I will miss her terribly cannot even begin to explain how I feel. A piece of me died the day she died.’

Shocked neighbour Andrea Duggan, 69, said at the time of the suspected murder: 'It’s such a horrendous thing to happen to a young family.

'You just can’t imagine what those two little boys are going through and you can only pray that they’ll be okay.

'It must be awful for their relatives too, being so far away in the US. It must be like a nightmare.

'I haven’t lived here long but it’s quite a close community. I think everyone is a bit shaken up by it, and a bit nervous.'

Tribute: One of many cards left outside the house by friends, neighbours and classmates of Mrs Parsons' sons

Neighbours said the family were under financial pressure and had recently set up two businesses in a bid to raise money.

One said: ‘My children are friends with the kids and they feel like they want to help but they just can’t.’

The couple are believed to have moved to Britain from the US after Mrs Parsons sold her health spa business in Oklahoma when it ran into financial difficulty.

Parsons, who has also worked as a fencer and builder, graduated from Bicester Community College in 1990. His mother Jean lives a short distance away.

Companies House records show he set up a heat pumps firm in October and his wife set up a company, called Wink Ink Ltd, two months earlier.

Mrs Parsons, a make-up artist and skin expert, worked for a series of cosmetic companies and at a Bicester beauty clinic. She specialised in make-up for professional modelling shoots and wedding days in the US and Britain.
