An MP who was suspended from the Liberal Democrats over claims he sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent publicly apologised to her yesterday.

Mike Hancock admitted he had ‘crossed the line’ and had an ‘inappropriate and unprofessional’ relationship with the woman after she asked him for help with noisy neighbours.

But in an extraordinary development last night, it emerged he will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog – meaning he could cling on as an independent MP until next year’s election.

The 68-year-old, who represents Portsmouth South, had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother, known only as ‘Annie’ or ‘AH’, during her four-year fight to obtain an apology. But yesterday as part of a High Court settlement he apologised unreservedly for any distress.

The case is a major embarrassment for Nick Clegg, who was accused of turning a blind eye to the claims, and follows a string of sex scandals to engulf the Lib Dems.

In a statement read at the High Court yesterday, Mr Hancock said: ‘In October 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your MP and councillor.

Subsequently and over several months I came to your home on several occasions, sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional.

‘I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and I crossed the line. As a political representative, there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which I was aware.

‘You had a right to trust me. Everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and I am sorry I made you feel otherwise. I have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again.’

He added: ‘I also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim. These statements sought to discredit and undermine you.

‘This should never have happened. I accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong.’

The 39-year-old woman had attempted to complain about Mr Hancock’s behaviour through the police, the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as well as the Liberal Democrat party and Portsmouth City Council, but her solicitor yesterday said she had been ‘blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage’.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had contemplated suicide over the ‘disgusting’ way she had been treated by the Liberal Democrats.

Yesterday she said: ‘I am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. Since the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my physical and mental health have suffered and I am grateful that I may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son.’

The woman first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours.

A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer.

■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she  targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat.

■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’

■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office.

■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann (right), a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’

■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’

In March 2011, the woman complained about Mr Hancock to senior Lib Dem officials at the party’s Westminster headquarters, but no action was taken against him.

In a letter to Mr Clegg’s office in February last year, she said Mr  Hancock had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her, but he was still not disciplined.

Last night she told the Mail: ‘Nick Clegg has been negligent. He should have acted sooner and taken notice of a woman in my position.’ The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards can examine financial wrongdoing but cannot investigate claims an MP has abused their position in other ways. It means Mr Hancock could keep his seat until the next election.

Portsmouth City Council did ask Nigel Pascoe QC to investigate the allegations. But his report was never published and the Lib Dem-controlled council voted to keep it under wraps.

In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.’

Mr Hancock was suspended from the Lib Dems in January after the case became public. The party yesterday said a disciplinary investigation will now be re-started.
