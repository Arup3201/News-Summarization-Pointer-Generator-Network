The country’s biggest car park chain has been fining drivers for putting pay-and-display tickets in the wrong place on their dashboards, according to a Tory MP.

Robert Halfon made the claim in Parliament yesterday as he called for an inquiry into the ‘disgraceful behaviour’ of NCP, which runs more than 500 car parks nationwide.

The MP for Harlow, in Essex, said he had been contacted by commuters complaining about the actions of wardens at his local railway station.  

Private parking firms like NCP 'fleece' motorists unfairly, Tory MP Robert Halfon (right) told the Commons today

They had ‘fined people for allegedly displaying their ticket on the wrong place on the car’s dashboard’, he said.

He asked William Hague, the Leader of the House: ‘Can you contact the transport minister and business minister and call for an urgent inquiry into this disgraceful behaviour by NCP?’

Mr Halfon said commuters had also complained about being fined for parking in a restricted area of the car park that had not been clearly signposted. 

‘My constituents have been fleeced by NCP, who have signposted restricted areas improperly and then fined people who innocently park in them,’ he added.

National Car Parks has been criticised in the past for high charges at hospital car parks and for increasing prices during big events such as the 2012 London Olympics.

Mr Halfon said residents using the station car park had been complaining since December about being unfairly targeted by wardens. 

Despite paying for parking and displaying a ticket, he added, drivers were told the area they were in was restricted for the use of council staff, whose offices are nearby.

‘These aren’t people trying to bend the rules,’ he said after the debate. ‘Why would you park on the third floor of a car park, and pay for your ticket, unless you thought you could park there? 

'They restricted this area and did not make it clear, and now the people who got caught out have contacted NCP and have heard nothing at all back.’

He added ‘a £50 fine is a lot for many people in Harlow’.

Mr Hague told MPs parking charges at stations are a commercial matter and complaints are investigated by the Office of Rail Regulation, which was not available for comment last night. 

Mr Halfon called for an urgent statement in Parliament on on the role of private car park owners like NCP

NCP denied it fined people over the placement of tickets. ‘NCP accepts any ticket that we can see clearly,’ a spokesman said. ‘We have no policy on where or how it is displayed, as long as we can see it.’

Mr Halfon ‘has not made any comment to us of late regarding “wrongly placed tickets”. He has, however, contacted us regarding our bay line markings.’

The spokesman said: ‘On the top level of this car park there is a section designated for customers who pay for premium bay parking. 

'These customers have paid for a designated bay and permit for their use when they park on the site; therefore we do patrol the site regularly to ensure that other customers who park in that area refrain from doing so in the future.

‘We have markings on the ground in front of all the bays that explain which spaces are restricted. 

'There are also large yellow signs in place when entering the car park and a restriction as the deck area is entered. 

'We have reviewed again all our restricted bay markings, which have been refreshed in the last eight weeks, and do believe these to be very clear.

‘We only issue (Penalty Charge Notices) if there is a strong reason for doing so, and always take photographic evidence.’

In 2003, motorist Vincent Ryan was fined £30 at an NCP car park in Ipswich for displaying his parking ticket upside down. The firm apologised and cancelled the penalty.
