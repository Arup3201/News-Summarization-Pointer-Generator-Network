'Three, four, five years ago we lost a big player every year,' he said.

'In the last two years we've added players like Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. I have more attacking options than I've had for a long time.'

The signing of £30million forward Sanchez has bolstered the FA Cup winners impressive front line, giving Wenger plenty of food for thought when all of his charges are fit.

1997/98

Main men: Nicolas Anelka, Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars Ray Parlour, Ian Wright

Wenger's second season at the club was a successful one winning the Premier League and FA Cup to complete the second league and cup double in the club's history.

With a stalwart defence, Wenger could utilise the talents of Ian Wright, Ray Parlour and Dennis Bergkamp alongside new signing Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka.

Bergkamp performed the role of the team's catalyst with 22 goals in all competitions for the Gunners, with Wright and Overmars also reaching double figures.

For many Gunners fans, Overmars winning strike at Manchester United in their 1-0 victory to help them turn around a 12-point deficit on the way to the title will never be forgotten.

2001/02

Main men: Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Nwankwo Kanu, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Sylvain Wiltord

After watching perennial domestic rivals United win the Premier League title three-years running, it was Arsenal's time to be crowned England's best in another glorious season for the north London outfit.

Still utilising the skills of Bergkamp, Wenger had made further additions since the 1997-98 season with Henry, Kanu, Ljungberg, Pires and Wiltord all joining the club since then.

The result? Another Premier League and FA Cup success as Arsenal won their second league and cup double in five years - with the title sweetly sealed at Old Trafford.

Henry scored 24 goals in the league, while Ljungberg doubled Arsenal's lead against London rivals Chelsea in their 2-0 FA Cup triumph.

2003/04

Main men: Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires

Arguably the greatest team ever to grace the Premier League era, the 2003/04 Arsenal team will forever be written in the history books.

Dubbed 'The Invincibles' the Gunners went unbeaten during the entire Premier League campaign as they ended the season as champions.

Winning 26 games and drawing 12, Arsenal's top goalscorer for the third year running was Thierry Henry - who scored 39 goals in 51 games.

The Frenchman was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and the FWA Footballer of the Year by the football writers.

To date nobody before or since has been able to match the Gunners feat in the Premier League.

2007/08

Main men: Emmanuel Adebayor, Nicklas Bendtner, Eduardo, Cesc Fabregas, Alexander Hleb, Tomas Rosicky, Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott

A season of hope and promise that all changed during one lunchtime kick off at Birmingham City.

The Gunners never fully recovered from their 2-2 draw at St Andrews in February in a league campaign that saw them challenge all the way for the Premier League title.

Club icon Henry had left for Barcelona before the season began, but Wenger looked to have remedied the blow with the arrival of Eduardo and with Cesc Fabregas becoming ever more influential in midfield.

Eduardo scored 12 goals in 31 games before breaking his leg in a horrible challenge with Birmingham defender Martin Taylor.

In the Croatia international's absence Emmanuel Adebayor continued to deliver the goods for the Emirates faithful in a breakthrough season for the Togo forward.

Adebayor ended as the club's highest scorer in all competitions with 30 goals as Wenger's side finished third in the league.

2008/09

Main men: Emmanuel Adebayor, Andrei Arshavin, Nicklas Bendtner, Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri, Tomas Rosicky, Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott

Fourth place, UEFA Champions League semi-finalists, FA Cup semi-finalists and League Cup quarter-finalists is all Arsenal had to show for in another season that the Gunners just came up short.

Summer signing Samir Nasri proved a hit in his debut season at the club, while Euro 2008 star man Andrei Arshavin showcased all his talents against Liverpool.

The Russian playmaker who joined from Zenit St. Petersburg in February 2009 scored all four of Arsenal's goals in a 4-4 draw at Anfield in a man-of-the-match performance.

With Fabregas continuing to pull the strings also; strikers Adebayor, Nicklas Bendtner and Robin van Persie all finished the season in double figures.
