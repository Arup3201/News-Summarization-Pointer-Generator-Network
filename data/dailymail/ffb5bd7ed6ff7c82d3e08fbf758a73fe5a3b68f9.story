He was so desperate to join the army he lied about his age to become part of the Royal Engineers. 

At the tender age of 17 Ted Young was part of the D-Day landings at Juno beach in France, and helped to push the Nazis out of the country and liberate it. 

Now, 70 years on and one of the youngest surviving veterans of the D-Day invasions, Mr Young has finally been honoured for his efforts with the highest decoration France can bestow.

Ted Young has been made a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur after he helped liberate France from Germany

Mr Young, 91, has been awarded the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur - the highest decoration in France - after he served in the Royal Engineers during the D-Day landings on Juno beach.

He was awarded the medal following a pledge by president Francois Hollande to honour those that helped liberate his country.

The veteran, from Poole, Dorset, was a sapper in the Royal Engineers on June 6, 1944 after he lied about his age - pretending to be 19 when he was actually 17. 

Mr Young had been rejected from the army once before when he tried to join up when he was 15-years-old.  

He landed on Juno beach alongside British and Canadian troops on D-Day and went on to help build bridges and Spitfire airstrips as the Allieds pushed the Nazis out of France.

Mr Young was part of the Royal Engineers who landed at Juno Beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944 

The veteran is now one of the youngest surviving of the D-Day landings after he lied about his age to join up 

Mr Young served in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany before being invalided home with a crushed ankle when a tank rolled over him.

The veteran was presented with the medal by honorary French consul Annie Burnside at a poignant ceremony in Bristol.

Irene Richards, his daughter, said: 'I am very proud of him. One of the most touching moment last year was when a boy of about 12 came up and shook Dad's hand and said, "Thank you for giving me the life I have today."'

Mr Young also wears his uncle William Young’s three WWI medals which includes the Mons Star, with the original ribbons. 

The National Order of the Legion of Honour is the highest decoration in France.  

It was established in May 1802 by Napoleon.  

Technically membership of the Legion d'Honneur is restricted to French nationals and Foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds.

However, foreigners who have served France may receive a distinction of the Legion, which is almost the same.

The order was created as a non-egalitarian award, with people being admitted to a degree regardless of their birth or religion. It was intended as a general military and civil order of merit.  

It is divided into five degrees; Chevalier (Knight), Officier (Officer), Commandeur (Commander), Grand Officier (Grand Officer), and Grand Croix (Grand Cross).

The highest order, Grand Cross, is limited to 80 members while the rank of Chevalier is unlimited.  

Famous
 British recipients include Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince 
Charles, Prince of Wales and the late Lord Mountbatten, author Graham 
Greene, actor Laurence Olivier and Sir Stuart Bell MP.

Last year Phyllis Latour Doyle, a British spy who parachuted behind enemy lines to collect intelligence on enemy positions ahead of the D-Day landings, was awarded the honour. 

In 2010 the membership consisted of; 67 Grand Cross, 314 Grand Officers, 3,009 Commanders, 17,032 Officers and 74,384 Knights.
