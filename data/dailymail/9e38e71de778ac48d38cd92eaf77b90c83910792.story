A former television star who once dated Katy Perry was not on drugs when he killed his landlady then died by falling off the roof of his home, an autopsy has revealed.

The death of Johnny Lewis was ruled an accident, despite speculation he had committed suicide after murdering 81-year-old Catherine Davis.

The autopsy also found that the actor had nail marks on his neck and had been partially strangled, suggesting that Davis tried to fight back when he attacked her.

Lewis was widely reported to have been on powerful hallucinogenic drugs or medication at the time of his death on September 26.

He had recently been released from 
jail and had a string of drug-related arrests before the killing, and 
his attorney had speculated he might have been in a drug-induced 
psychosis when he killed Davis.

But toxicology results found no 
traces of cocaine, alcohol, marijuana or any other types of drugs in the
actor's system. Officials checked for anti-psychotic drugs as well as 
psychedelic drugs.

His death was ruled accidental because there was no evidence he attempted to kill himself or had been pushed.

Horror: Lewis, 28, who once starred in the O.C. and dated Katy Perry, was also said to have savagely dismembered his landlady's cat before his fatal fall from the roof

Police believe Lewis fell while 
trying to flee the home after killing Davis, who operated a retreat for 
writers and actors out of her home.

He had been arrested three times 
during the past year. Probation officials earlier this year expressed 
concern about Lewis' mental health and his danger to others.

A probation officer who evaluated 
Lewis' case after he attempted to break into the home of a woman wrote 
that he was being 'very concerned for the well-being of not only the 
community but that of the defendant.'

The report added Lewis suffered from some form of chemical dependency and mental health issue, and was a transient.

'Given this, he will continue to be a threat to any community he may reside,' it said.

The break-in attempt came about six weeks after the actor hit two men over the head with a bottle during a fight.

Lewis' attorney, Jonathan Mandel, 
said after his client's death that drugs may have been a factor in the 
deaths. He said he recommended treatment for Lewis but the actor 
declined it.

Lewis, who had starred in The O.C. and more recently Sons Of Anarchy, had strong ties to the Church of Scientology.

Davis was found beaten and strangled in her bedroom at the property, according toÂ GMA. Her cat was discovered dead in a bathroom.

The property in Loz Feliz, popular with a
celebrity crowd, is composed of five suites and a guest house which 
each rent for $1,650 to $3,000 per month.

According to TMZ the
home was popular with celebrities including indie film actor Parker 
Posey, who starred in Dazed And Confused and You've Got Mail, and SNL 
star Chris Parnell.

Actor
Thomas Jane, star of films Hung and The Punisher, Matt Bomer from TV 
series White Collar and comedian Paula Poundstone are also past 
residents.

The rambling Spanish-style property is 'set up for creative people', according to its website.

Lewis, who dated singer Katy Perry around six years ago, was involved in Scientology. The controversial religion is followed by such celebrities as Tom Cruise and John Travolta.

The
church did not confirm whether the actor, who was released from prison 
only six days ago, was indeed a member of the organization.

The
actor had reportedly spent time in a Scientology drug rehab program 
called Narconon in 2004 and had spoken publicly about the method - 
although the organization removed all traces of him from their website 
after his death.

Lewis was also in the middle of a custody battle over his young daughter with her mother, who he had never married.

Devastated: Perry is said to have been left distraught by news of her ex-boyfriend's death

Katy Perry was left 'devastated'
after the death of her ex-boyfriend.

A source close to the singer, 27, who
dated the actor from 2005 to 2006, 
revealed that Perry could tell Lewis was on a destructive path back when
they were dating.

'She had to separate from him... to get ahead and focus on her career,' the source said.

'He was in trouble then and she couldn't help him. A lot of her songs were partially inspired by him,' the source told US magazine.

'I know The
One That Got Away and Circle the Drain are partly about him. But she
was young and it was a time in her life she cherishes.'

Neighbours called police after 
hearing a woman screaming and witnessing Lewis attack two men with a 
piece of wood out the front of Davis' property, where the actor was understood to be renting a room.

The other victims - a neighbor and a handyman - were badly beaten 
after the tussle, which lasted around four minutes and began when Lewis 
tried to break into the neighbor's home.

The men Lewis fought with told officers he showed 'super-human strength' and was 'phenomenally strong.'

In
an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the neighbor said Lewis was 
hardly deterred by the blows he took, that it was like 'hitting him with
a fly swatter.'
