A Samurai sword-fighting RAF Officer and cancer survivor has been crowned Britain's Manliest Man.

Flight Lieutenant Alun 'Peps' Pepper, 43, fought off more than 1,000 fellow testosterone-filled applicants to win the nationwide competition.

A true thrillseeker, Alun's favourite hobbies include skydiving, Thai boxing and he attends Japanese Samurai sword classes - all on top of his job as a Fast Jet Weapons System officer for the RAF.

The Samurai sword-wielding Alun has also battled testicular cancer, losing a testicle to the disease  

But judges said Alun stood out during the macho contest because of his bravery in speaking out about his struggles with testicular cancer in 2006.

And women will be glad to hear the newly crowned ultimate man is still single and looking for love.

Alun, from Crewe, Cheshire, said: 'I'm thrilled to have won the title of Britain's Manliest Man.

'The main reason I entered the competition is because the cause is something that really resonates with me.

'I do a lot of manly stuff but I know there are stronger, more muscly men out there.

'I think it was a combination of things, from all the sports I do and my job, through to the fact I was prepared to speak out about what had happened to me.

'I found out first-hand how vital it is to be aware of the early signs of testicular cancer, and if I hadn't known what to look out for then I might not be here today.

'I was diagnosed in the July of 2006 and by the October I was back flying again because they caught it early.

Alun, here on holiday in Italy, recreating the scene from James Bond, speaks openly about his experience with cancer, encouraging other young men to check regularly and know the signs 

'After having the testicle removed, I only needed one dose of chemo and that was fine. To be honest, I've felt worse after a hangover than I did after my dose of chemo.

'I'm chuffed to have been given the title. I got about 23,000 votes and the person in second place got about 11,000 so it was a real confidence boost for me.

'But the best thing about it has been the men and their girlfriends coming up to me and saying after seeing me talk about my experience of the disease they have now started checking too.'

The eligible bachelor now lives next to RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, and works at the base as a Flight Commander for the Initial Officer Training school.

He is also a qualified coach with the RAF Boxing Association, the Deputy Chairman of the RAF Martial Arts Association, and practices Japanese sword fighting.

The competition was run jointly by men's grooming brand The Bluebeards Revenge, Men's Fitness magazine and male cancer charity Orchid.

They launched the campaign in August to find the most masculine male in the UK with the aim of increasing awareness of testicular cancer.

More than 1,000 people entered the competition, and representatives from the companies that created the campaign whittled those entrants down to a shortlist of 40 men.

The public were then able to vote online from the start of November for who they believed deserved the macho accolade most.

The winner was to be given a year-long role as an ambassador for the Orchid charity and be given a modelling contract as the face of Bluebeards Revenge.

Nick Gibbens, spokesman for Bluebeards Revenge, said: 'We had a vast number of entries to the competition, and there were some really strong candidates boasting all manner of manly jobs, muscular physiques and macho hobbies.

'But what makes Alun a real winner in our eyes is his bravery in speaking out about his own experiences with testicular cancer.

'He is living proof that suffering the disease and receiving treatment for it will result in no loss of manliness whatsoever.

'He was the only man to make the short-list who has actually mentioned having testicular cancer, and he ended up getting a lot of female attention during the voting process through social media.

'I think it helped that he is still single, but he ended up winning the competition comfortably.'
