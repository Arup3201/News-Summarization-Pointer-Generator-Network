If Manchester United manage to bring Mats Hummels to Old Trafford, it would be the finest transfer coup of the club’s recent history.

Hummels has shown in recent years, and not least at the last World Cup, that he has the ability, the intelligence and the character to become one of football’s great defenders.

A ball playing centre half, Hummels not only controls the pace of the game from the back, he can also make surging runs forward, both at set pieces and in open play. His pace and intelligence give him the versatility to play either in a high line or as a deep lying centre back.

Right time and place: Hummels defensive capabilities were on show in the World Cup final

Over the last few years, Hummels has been perfectly suited to Jurgen Klopp’s revolution at Borussia Dortmund, both as a gifted player and as an on field leader. Under Klopp, he has won two German titles, a German Cup, and reached the Final of the Champions League in 2013.

Unlike the likes of Mario Gotze and Marco Reus, however, Hummels is not a product of the Dortmund youth system. The defender learnt his trade at Bayern Munich, where his father was in charge of the youth system between 1995 and 2012.

Bayern, though, squandered Hummels’ talent, loaning him out to Dortmund rather than giving him first team opportunities. In 2009, a permanent transfer was agreed. Hummels has since shown his former club what they are missing, pipping Bayern to several titles and vowing repeatedly never to return to the club.

Under Jurgen Klopp, who as a player also trained under Hummels’ father, the defender has developed into one of Europe’s most impressive, modern defenders. He has shown his class not only in the yellow and black of BVB, but also in the white shirts of the national team.

Hummels’ man of the match winning performance against France at the World Cup was his finest in a Germany shirt. It not only showed his footballing prowess, but also the strength of his will. He has had to fight almost incessant setbacks to establish himself under Joachim Low.

Just two years ago, Hummels was public enemy number one. His errors in the Euro 2012 semi-final saw Germany fall embarassingly against Italy. Hummels, who has always radiated confidence, was vilified not only for his mistakes on the pitch, but also his vanity off it. He was seen as arrogant, as a player who overestimated himself.

Joachim Low seemed to share the view, and over the following years often left Hummels out of the first team, opting instead for Arsenal’s Per Mertesacker. Hummels and Dortmund were so frustrated that they accused Low of making it difficult for Dortmund players to succeed internationally.

After 
finally regaining Low’s trust with a goal against Italy last autumn, 
Hummels then suffered an almost season ending injury, which looked set 
to shatter his World Cup chances.

But
 the Dortmund defender fought back. His performances at the World Cup 
were repeatedly brilliant, often being the only man to prevent Germany’s
 wobbly defence from collapse.

If Hummels’
 international career shows one thing, it is that he has an immense 
desire to prove himself on every single stage. He has not only the 
quality to boost Manchester United’s defence, but also the character to 
assimilate very quickly into Premier League football.

Whether he will leave Dortmund is another matter. When he extended his contract until 2017 two years ago, Hummels refused to add in a buyout clause, on the grounds that he did not want to leave the club on bad terms. His relationship to Dortmund and to Juergen Klopp is very strong. It will take Louis van Gaal a huge amount of persuasion to tempt the player to England.

If he manages it, though, United fans may rejoice. Hummels’ quality is out of the question. His character, meanwhile, means that you can never ever write him off.
