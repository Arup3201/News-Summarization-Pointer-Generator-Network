A former Royal Marine Commando has broken his own record for Britain's deepest ever freedive.

In a competition in the Bahamas, Michael Board, 42, swam to a depth of 328ft (100m) using only a fin on his feet for propulsion and a rope to make sure he stayed in a straight line.

The dive was deeper than the height of the Elizabeth Tower, otherwise known as Big Ben, and meant Micheal held his breath for nearly three minutes.

Micheal Board, 42, originally from London, has broken his own freediving record by reaching a depth of 328ft (100m) using only a fin on his feet and a rope to keep him in a straight line

During the dive Board's lungs would have been crushed to a quarter of their normal size, which made him black out on a previous attempt just a few days beforehand

During the dive Board held his breath for nearly three minutes. On land the former Green Beret can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds

At that depth the air in his lungs would have become compressed, crushing them to a quarter of their normal size, which can lead to blackouts.

Speaking after the event the freedive instructor said: 'The dive felt good. I was obviously apprehensive having blacked out in my previous attempt a few days before but I changed a few things for this dive, took a little less weight down, and had less pre-dive nerves.

'Not everything went right though, my nose-clip was not tight enough and I was losing air on the descent so I almost ran out of equalisation before the bottom and only just made it.

'However the ascent felt strong, the light was much better which really helped right at the end of the dive when surfacing.'

The previous record, set by Micheal in January this year, was 315ft (96m). He managed to dive to 100m on that occasion but was disqualified because his nose peg fell off.

The freedive instructor became interested in the sport while scuba diving and after realising he could hold his breath for longer than his friends

Micheal has actually reached 100m three times before but was disqualified when his nose peg fell off, ruptured an eardrum, and blacked out

The freedive instructor now lives in Gili Trawangan in Indonesia with his girlfriend Kate Middleton who holds the New Zealand record for Constant Weight freediving

Michael, who now runs a diving school in Indonesia with his girlfriend Kate Middleton (no relation to the Duchess), became interested in free diving while working as a scuba diving instructor.

He used to get into contests with his friends to see who could hold their breath the longest and found he was quite good at it.

So good, in fact, that on the surface he can hold his breath for six minutes and 32 seconds.

He said: 'I wanted to do more of it and learned to become a freediving instructor. I've been doing if for four-and-a-half-years now.'

The last freedive records not to be held by Michael was 298ft (91m) and held by Dave King, a geography teacher from Brighton who set it in 2009.

The world record holder for free immersion diving is William Trubidge, from, New Zealand, which stands at 397ft (121m), nearly twice the height of Tower Bridge.

The previous record holder before Micheal was held by Dave King, a geography teacher who set it in 2009

The Suunto Vertical Blue freediving competition is an annual competition which takes place at Dean's Blue Hole, the world's deepest known blue hole with saltwater

The current world record for freediving stands at 121m, nearly twice the height of Tower Bridge, and was set by William Trubidge, from, New Zealand

Board's record-breaking dive was his fourth attempt at reaching the 100m mark.

The Brit failed in his first attempt at last's years Suunto Vertical Blue, where he was disqualified for taking too long to complete the necessary surface protocol.

His second try was this year at the world championships in Kalamata where he had trouble equalising and ruptured his eardrum, which took eight weeks to heal.

His third attempt, a couple of days before his record-setting dive, saw him suffer a small blackout on the surface, before eventually succeeding with his forth.

The former Green Beret says he spends most of the year in Gili Trawangan in Indonesia where he runs the Freedive Gili school with Kate, who holds the New Zealand record for Constant Weight freediving.

He added: 'I have my own 25m pool there and unlimited depth but it is open water diving so conditions are not always ideal like here in the Blue Hole.

'However it does allow me to maintain dive fitness and flexibility throughout the year.'
