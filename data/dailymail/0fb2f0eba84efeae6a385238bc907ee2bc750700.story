Right wing bloggers have used the death of captured aid worker Kayla Mueller to criticise her humanitarian work with Palestinians and brand her a 'Jew-hating piece of c***.' 

Kayla Mueller was a dedicated humanitarian who worked across the world and in Palestine to help those displaced by war. She was confirmed dead last week after being held hostage by extremist group ISIS since August 2013.

While dozens of tributes have been paid to the woman who was captured in Syria as she tried to help refugees caught up in the conflict, bloggers have used the opportunity to criticise her for her work.

Right wing blogger Debbie Schlussel branded ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller a 'jew-hater' and 'anti-American' because of her work with Palestinians, following confirmation of Miss Mueller's death on Friday 

Right wing blogger Debbie Schussel called her death last week 'poetic justice', attacking the 26-year-old for supporting Palestinians and trying to help those displaced by the Syrian civil war. 

On her self-titled blog wrote: 'So, it’s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.'

The post was written under the heading: 'Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel B****.'

Schlussel accused Miss Mueller of writing anti-Israel blog posts and of supporting Palestinians and HAMAS to carry out attacks and smuggle weapons by trying to help them, and stopped Israelis demolishing the houses of extremist groups.

She claimed the 26-year-old 'helped Palestinians harass Israeli soldiers and block them from doing their job of keeping Islamic terrorists out of Israel' and dubbed her 'anti-American.' 

In a hate-riddled rant Schlussel said her reaction to news of the death of Miss Mueller and other hostages like her was 'so sad, too bad.'

Joel Pollak, a political commentator in America, branded Miss Mueller an 'anti-Israel activist' for her work 

Miss Mueller volunteered across the world to help refugees who had been displaced by civil wars 

Her comments have been echoed by other campaigners in America. 

Joel Pollack, an American political commentator and author, posted on Twitter: 'Sad that Kayla Mueller was anti-Israel activist. If she understood both sides she might have avoided idealizing the enemy that killed her.' 

The Gatewaypundit blog also accused the American of aiding terrorists and opposing Jewish people.

Miss Mueller, originally from Arizona, had been volunteering across the world since 2009 and was working at the Syrian-Turkey border in 2013. In August she travelled to Syria, desperate to help refugees displaced by the war, and was taken hostage with three other people. 

The 26-year-old was forced by ISIS to feature in a video to prove to her parents she was still alive and last Friday the terrorist group claimed she had died. They said she was killed by a Jordanian strike in Raqqa - a fact disputed by authorities in America and Jordan.
