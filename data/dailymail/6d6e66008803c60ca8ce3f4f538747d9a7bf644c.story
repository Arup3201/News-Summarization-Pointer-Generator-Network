Bearing down on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer can prove a daunting task for some of the world's best attackers, so the thought of seeing of two of the imposing 28-year-old is bound to put a shiver down the spine of most.

However, those who are in fear need not to panic as the Bayern Munich stopper's doppelganger is merely a wax figure of himself at Madame Tussauds in Berlin.

Neuer was in attendance to see his wax-work unveiling - depicted from his World Cup heroics with Germany following last summer's triumph in Brazil.

The Bayern ace was all smiles as he posed alongside his wax figure on Monday and tweeted after the exhibition: 'Now there's a new Neuer in #MadameTussauds in #Berlin.'

Neuer, who was voted third behind Lionel Messi and winner Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'or earlier this month, is back in Germany after enjoying a nine-day winter break training camp in the Middle East with Bayern.

Fresh from their trip, Neuer was back in action for Pep Guardiola's side as they swept aside German second-division side Bochum 5-1 on Friday night. 

Bayern, who are undefeated in the Bundesliga this season, resume their domestic campaign on Friday night at Wolfsburg.
