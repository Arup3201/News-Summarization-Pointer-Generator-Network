An investigation has been launched after a driver was killed when his car was hit by a train on a level crossing.

Emergency crews rushed to Pleasants level crossing near Downham, Norfolk, at around 1.15pm this afternoon.

The car was hit by the 12.56pm service travelling from Lynn to London Kings Cross and became 'impaled' on the front of a train.

Tragic: A driver was killed after his car was hit by a train on a level crossing. Emergency crews rushed to Pleasants level crossing near Downham, Norfolk, at around 1.15pm this afternoon

Safety: The crossing is fitted with red and green lights and a telephone - to ring for assistance, and requires drivers to leave their vehicle and open gates across the railway

The male driver, who was in a Kia Sportage 4x4, was pronounced dead at the scene and his family have been informed.

Approximately 70 passengers were on the First Capital Connect train when it smashed into the vehicle.

The car was pushed 500 yards down the
line by the train, which was believed to have been travelling at 70mph 
when the impact occurred on a straight section of single track.

All four coaches remained on the rails.

No one onboard was injured and buses were drafted in to collect the stranded passengers.

A passenger on the train described hearing a 'horrendous bang' before 'the train eventually came to a halt'.

He said: 'I've had a look outside and the car is impaled on the front of the train.'

Investigation: Police are currently working to establish the full circumstances including how the car came to be on the tracks

A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'BTP officers were called to Pleasant level crossing, near Downham Market, Norfolk, on Thursday, 12 July, following a report of a car being struck by a train.

'Norfolk and Cambridgeshire Constabulary officers also attended the incident, which was reported to BTP at 1.15pm, along with local fire and ambulance services.

'Police are currently working to establish the full circumstances including how the car came to be on the tracks.'

A rail company spokesman said no-one on the train was injured, although the driver was shaken by the incident.

Scene: Wreckage of the car on the rail line - the family of the male driver, who was in a Kia Sportage 4x4, have been informed

The crossing was fitted with red and green lights and a telephone - to ring for assistance, and requires drivers to leave their vehicle and open gates across the railway.

Network Rail yesterday confirmed the crossing was a 'user worked crossing'.

British Transport Police, said there were no suspicious circumstances and the crash was being treated as an accident

Joshua Palmer, who lives near the crossing, witnessed the aftermath of the crash after hearing a loud bang.

He said he saw a cloud of smoke outside and said the car had been pushed along the tracks to the next railway crossing.

A
woman on board the train who was travelling with her boyfriend said she
saw debris fly past her window after hearing a 'massive smash'.

Speaking
to a local radio station while on board the train she said: 'I felt bit
scared, a bit bit sad actually because of what happened to the driver.

'We were not supposed to be on this train because we were trying to get the earlier one.

'We got about 20 minutes into the 
journey and then suddenly there was this massive smash and me and my 
boyfriend looked at each other thinking what was that.

'Lots of things like debris pushed passed the window and there are scratches on the window still there now.

'Then
the train just started suddenly slowing down. We did not know what it 
was or anything and we have just been stuck here since.

'Everyone was just looking at each other like what's going on. There was a mild sense of panic.'

Inspector
Bob Munn, from British Transport Police, said there were no suspicious 
circumstances and the crash was being treated as an accident.

He said the train had come to rest in an upright position and had not been derailed.
