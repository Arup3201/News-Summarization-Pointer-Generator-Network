A coworker of the cab driver allegedly responsible for the crash that killed CBS correspondent Bob Simon allegedly warned management two days before the accident about his driving.

The New York Post reports a driver at the same cab company passed on passenger complaints about Abdul Reshad Fedahi, 44, to his bosses, but that didn't stop him from getting on the road.

'Management said they’ll check with the lawyers, and they said if he has a valid license, he can work,' one driver said. 'And then this happened.'

Veteran journalist Bob Simon, pictured in 2011 in his CBS office with his impressive collection of Emmys, was killed in a taxi crash in New York City on Wednesday 

Investigators believe that Fedahi, of Queens, may have been speeding along the West Side Highway on Wednesday, leading up to the crash that killed the 73-year-old CBS reporter.

A preliminary investigation showed Fedahi may have hit the gas instead of the brake before colliding with a Mercedes-Benz and then careening into the median.

The driver had been fired from his company, Skyline Credit Ride, before but came back two months ago after new management took over the business.

'Since he came back, customers were e-mail­ing the company,' one cab driver told the Post. 'They didn't feel comfortable riding with him.'

Fedahi, whose license had been suspended nine times, was leasing a car from Travez Transportation, which is invested in Skyline.

The arrangement allowed him to drive under a 'full-hire vehicle' license rather than a cab driver medallion, the latter of which requires going to taxi school.

Reshad Abdul Fedahi, from Queens, New York, also had two previous traffic convictions and his license suspended more than half a dozen times

Veteran correspondent Bob Simon was in a taxi that hit a Mercedes-Benz being driven by a 23-year-old man, and then slammed into the median on Manhattan's West Side on Wednesday night

'He hit me and he looked like he lost control of the car,' said the 23-year-old driver of the Mercedes about the livery cab driver following the accident on the West Side Highway. The car that Simon was traveling in is pictured 

He was also driving without the use of his left arm, which had gone 'dead' from injuries sustained in what the Post reports was a failed suicide attempt about a decade ago. 

CBS reports that Fedahi, an Afghan immigrant, had been living at a homeless shelter on Ward's Island towards the north of the city for at least four months before the crash. 

Simon, 73, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died after the crash on Manhattan's West Side Highway.

He was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt, and suffered a broken neck and stomach injuries in the crash according to the New York Post. 

Simon was on his way to hear a friend give a lecture about Ebola, which he was working on a segment about, downtown at the time.

His family were believed to be finalizing the award-winning journalist's funeral plans today to be held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home. 

It was suggested that Fedahi, may have suffered a heart attack shortly before the crash but the report was unconfirmed, according to the New York Daily News. 

He suffered two broken legs and a broken arm and was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was in a stable condition. 

Fedahi is estranged from his wife, Shekiba, with whom he has a daughter. 

His cousin, Rauf Sharif, claims that after the separation from his wife, Fedahi tried to take his own life.

'He was on a suicide mission,' said the man. 

'He dropped himself from a building. I don't know how many floors in Brooklyn. He went through hard days in his life.' 

From the catastrophic damage to the livery cab at the scene, investigators were planning to interview the driver because they believe speed may have been a factor in the crash. 

The Emmy-award winning reporter had been travelling south in a Lincoln when it rear-ended a Mercedes-Benz stopped at a red light on 12th Avenue near West 30th Street around 6.45pm, and then slammed into the metal barriers separating the lanes. 

The driver of the Mercedes-Benz was identified as  Zachary Miller, 23, of New Rochelle, by the Daily News.

Mr Miller told the New York Post on Thursday said: 'Obviously, I’m devastated to hear that he had died, and I wish there was something anyone could have done to prevent this horrible thing from happening.'

The 23-year-old, who was not injured, said that he had the utmost sympathy for Simon's wife and daughter. Mr Miller has given a full statement to the police.

Simon, who lived on the Upper West Side, had been traveling downtown to attend a medical seminar.

The crash was not caught on surveillance camera but investigators were expected to look at the livery cab's 'black box'. 

The NYPD refused to comment on the crash to Daily Mail Online on Thursday, citing an ongoing investigation. No charges have so far been filed. 

Simon is survived by his wife, Françoise Simon, daughter, Tanya, who is a producer for 60 Minutes, son-in-law Dr Evan Garfein and his grandson, Jack.
