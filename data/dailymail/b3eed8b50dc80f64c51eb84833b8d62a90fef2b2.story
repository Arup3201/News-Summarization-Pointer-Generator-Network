The cost of a one week holiday for a family of four has risen by an average of just 0.3 per cent (£23) since last October - significantly less than UK inflation (1.5 per cent).

Half of the top ten most affordable destinations are in Europe, demonstrating the strength of the pound, which has gained five per cent on the euro over the past year. Short haul flights for European sunshine destinations also deliver additional cost benefits compared to travelling further afield.

Tenerife is the most affordable sunshine destination this October half term, where a week long holiday will cost £450 per person. With nine hours of sun a day, and relatively short flight times, it is ideal for families on a budget looking for some warmer weather before winter sets in

Idyllic: Travelling to Antigua for October sun will not come cheap

In contrast, Antigua is the most expensive half term destination for sun seekers, costing £1,378 per person, with the higher price mainly due to the cost of travelling long haul

Menorca has seen the biggest reduction in price, falling by one per cent (£18) on last October half term, making it the second most affordable destination overall, at £453 per person

Meanwhile, a holiday to Florida has seen the biggest price increase; a family of four will see a rise of 2.1 per cent (£106) compared to October 2013. High flight and activity costs make it the second most expensive destination overall for those looking to get some sun this half term.

Cyprus offers the best weather in Europe for this time of year; boasting average temperatures of 22°C, ten hours of sunshine and just 40mm of rain. This compares to an average temperature of 13°C, five hours of sunshine and 71mm of rain in the UK. Cyprus is also the fourth most affordable destination overall, costing £604 per person and, with an average flight time of just four and a half hours, is an ideal choice for many families.

Long haul destinations offer the warmest weather, with Antigua and Barbados enjoying an average of 27°C in October, however the rainy season means higher levels of rainfall at this time of year. They are also among the most costly destinations, coming in at first and third most expensive respectively.

Paul Stokes, head of products at M&S Bank, who have conducted the research, said: 'Due to the strength of the pound against the euro, holidaymakers can take advantage of better value getaways this half term and our research shows that families don't necessarily need to travel far afield to enjoy some sun, with some European destinations promising plenty of sunshine and high average temperatures.'
