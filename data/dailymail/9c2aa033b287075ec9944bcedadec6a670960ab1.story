A newly-released surveillance video taken from inside an Oklahoma prison shows a former crime boss and key federal witness lured to his death by fellow inmates.

Six inmates have been charged with murder in what looks like a pre-planned attack in which they worked together, and even celebrated afterwards.

Anthony Mollman, a former motorcycle gang member and admitted drug trafficker, was found in a cell at the Grady County Jail on May 17, 2012.

Pre-planned: As the video begins, one of the inmates can be seen signaling to someone in a cell

Led to his death: Mollman, bald and dressed in his full prison jumpsuit, seen at right, enters the shot with two others

Marked for death: Mollman ascends the stairs with one of his attackers, unaware that he's walking into a trap

His death came just more than a year after his arrest in 2011. He had pleaded guilty to various drug charges and was a key witness for the government in an ongoing drug investigation.

The six inmates charged in Mollman's murder have been identified as Cody Sitlington, Grant Curry, Matthew Jackson, Joseph Hill, Jerry Gonzales and Steven Nidey.

Sitlington, whom Grady County Assistant District Attorney Leah Edwards calls one of the primary attackers, is the first inmate to appear before a judge. His next court date is next month.

She told News 9: 'Although much of what went on is obscured by the shutting of doors we still have a clearer picture of how the incident occurred and who the major players were.'

Defense: At one point, Mollman emerges from the cell, appearing to fight off his attackers

Death: After the inmates come out of the cell again, Mollman staggers before collapsing

The video begins with two inmates standing around a common area, appearing to watch TV.

Two more convicts then enters the frame, with one of them checking out doors and looking around the room.

He then jumps on a table, signaling another inmate inside a cell on the second level.

Brutality: The inmates can than be seen hoisting Mollman's body and dragging him into an adjacent cell

As you were: With Mollman lying motionless, some of the inmates continue watching TV as others scramble to cover up the crime

Not long after the gesture, Mollman, bald and dressed in his full prison jumpsuit, enters the shot with two others.

They lead Mollman up the stairs and into one of the cells.

While little can be seen on the video, it's clear that Mollman and the other inmates are involved in some type of scuffle.

At one point, Mollman emerges with his fists up, fighting back against his attackers in a desperate attempt.

When they come out again, Mollman staggers and collapses on the ground.

The inmates then drag his lifeless body into one of the cells.

With his feet sticking out of the cell door, the inmates appear to cover up the murder, with one of them wiping blood off the floor with a towel.

Jail officers responded minutes later and found Mollman dead in the cell with cuts on his body and apparently beaten to death.

While they examined Mollman's body, two of the inmates appear to fist bump right outside the cell.

His family had said that he was also attacked a week before his death.
