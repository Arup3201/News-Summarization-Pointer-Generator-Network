A department of Germany’s equivalent of the FBI installed surveillance cameras and assigned a surveillance officer to capture a suspected toilet roll thief on their premises.

The Landeskriminalamt, which track white collar criminals, organised gangs and terrorists, spent thousands on the investigation after cleaners reported an ‘unusally high’ usage of toilet paper.

A secret camera was installed in the stairwell of House 5 in Waltersleben, Thuringian and a detective who used to listen to covert 
telephone recordings of crooks was assigned to overall command of 
‘Operation Bog Roll,’ as the media have dubbed it.

Paper thief: The German federal police spent thousands of euros on the investigation to find out who stole the toilet roll

Cleaners in the building reported that rolls were going missing from their delivery bags when left unattended.

However, once the cameras were set up, and the bags containing the prize were left unguarded, the investigation failed to catch anyone stealing the loot.

The public prosecutor’s office in nearby Erfurt was informed of the secret op which ran for a year-and-a-half but was suspended in 2011.

It has only come to light now after an
internal inquiry ruled the ‘personal rights’ of all employees in the 
building had been violated.

Always watching: The department installed a CCTV camera which was watched by a designated investigator

Private investigation: The Landeskriminalamt department ran the secret operation for 18 months

Officials who sanctioned the covert 
operation would have needed the permission of a judge to make it legal -
something they didn’t do.

Lawyers have argued that the case is of 'petty crime' and the use of surveillance does not match up to the the thefts.

Germany’s main police trade union has 
now demanded an independent commission of enquiry about the affair and 
disciplinary proceedings against those who sanctioned it.
