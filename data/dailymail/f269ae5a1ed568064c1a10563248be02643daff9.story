Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross is at loggerheads with  his neighbours over plans to ‘substantially demolish’ his £17 million Grade II listed house.

The veteran broadcaster, 66, wants to rip out much of the building behind the historic facade and replace it with a new six-storey designer home, which would include five bedrooms, a garage, a two- storey basement, a gymnasium, projection room, staff quarters and a wine cellar. 

Ross and his wife Sarah Caplin also intend to transform the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of balconies to the house itself, giving views over their West London square.

But local residents claim the  couple’s plans for the Georgian villa, which dates back from 1826, are out of character with the area and would impinge on their privacy. 

Ross’s ambitious plans for the house, which will be considered by Westminster Council’s planning committee on Tuesday, could cost more than £10 million to implement. 

But local property experts say the alterations could more than double the current value of the house to an asking price of about £40 million.

Last year it emerged that Ross and Caplin had sold another luxury property for £35 million – more than 40 times what they paid for it in 1993.

The value of that house, which was bought by Saudi businessman Wafic Said, had been significantly raised by extensive renovations. 

But Ross’s plans for the new house, which he does not currently live in, could be rejected by Westminster councillors. The council’s officials have already recommended that the scheme be turned down.

Their recommendation follows complaints from residents who worry the pergolas are ‘too brutal’ and that the basement development would set a damaging precedent for the area. Three neighbours have also warned that the balconies would give intrusive views of their properties.

Christopher Wright, secretary of Bayswater Residents Association, accepts that the existing building is in need of renovation, but believes that the current design would be overbearing. In a letter to the council sent last month, he wrote: ‘We do not consider that introducing a  modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square, but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive.’

Local Tory council member Andrew Smith said: ‘There are concerns about both the design of the proposed building and the implications for privacy.’

Ross last night insisted he was doing his best to address the concerns and that the plans would transform a building that was currently ‘unloved and unlived-in’.

He said: ‘It’s always hard to reconcile different views on architecture, and most planning applications in central London meet resistance, which is why we’ve put this out to extensive consultation and made many changes as a result.’
