HBO has launched its HBO NOW channel on the Apple TV set-top box, iPhone and iPad ahead of the series premiere of HBO hit show Game of Thrones on April 12.

The announcement comes weeks after Apple cut the price of its Apple TV device from $99 (£65) to $69 (£45) in an effort to make it competitive with the likes of Google Chromecast.

HBO NOW's official iPhone and iPad app is also rolling out on the App Store today, according to MacRumours, and should become available for all users by the end of the day. 

After subscribing to HBO NOW through Apple TV or an iOS device, users can also access the HBO NOW website to stream content on the web using a Mac - similar to Netflix. 

However, it will only be exclusively available through Apple for three months before moving on to other platforms.

New York-based HBO, a unit of Time Warner, has so far been available only to customers with a pay television subscription.

The HBO Now service however, is currently only available in the US. The company has not yet revealed whether HBO Now will be rolled out internationally.

With HBO Now, the company is aiming to reach people who have broadband access but don't want to pay for a traditional TV package of dozens of other channels.

For the monthly fee, viewers will be able to get HBO content without having to pay for an entire cable package, the company said.

The first month is free for early-bird subscribers, the company added.

'This is a transformative moment for HBO,' said chief executive Richard Pepler after an introduction from Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.

The service will ship with the Apple TV in the US, which is now at a lower price of $69 (£45).

The price cut is a reaction to devices such as the Google Chromecast having lowered their price to $35 and Roku 2 costing just $70.

Time Warner said it wants to push its HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service.

It is also targeting the 70 million US cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers.

Outside the US, HBO shows are available through online and pay TV subscription services, such as Sky. They include Game of Thrones, the Sopranos, Veep, Silicon Valley and Sex in the City.
