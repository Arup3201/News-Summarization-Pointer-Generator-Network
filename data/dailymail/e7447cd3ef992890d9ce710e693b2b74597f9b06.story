Short people are up to 50 per cent more likely to die from dementia than the tallest, it is claimed.

And men are most at risk, according to a study.

Being short does not cause dementia, say the experts, but it may be a marker for poor nutrition in childhood or other early life factors that affect growth.

Such factors are already linked to a higher risk of heart disease among shorter people.

‘We found shorter adult height was associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia death and that this association was stronger in men,’ said Dr Tom Russ, who led the study.

Researchers from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at Edinburgh University analysed data from 18 studies involving almost 182,000 people between 1994 and 2008.

The height of participants was measured and other information, including social status and health history, collected.

Of 17,553 deaths during an average follow-up period of ten years, 1,093 were from dementia.

The study found the risk of dying from dementia was 50 per cent higher among the shortest men compared with the tallest.

For every 2.87in decrease in height from the average 5ft 6ins for men, a person was 26 per cent more likely to die from the condition

Among women, the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest. There was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height 

There was a 24 per cent increase in risk for every three inches of reduced height among those in the studies. 

Among women, the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest. There was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height.

Dr Russ, of the University of Edinburgh’s College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine, said it was the biggest study of its type.

Senior author, Dr David Batty, of the Department of Epidemiology & Public Health at University College London, added: ‘Short height in itself of course does not “cause” dementia. Rather, height captures a number of early life factors, including early-life illness, adversity, poor nutrition, and psychosocial stress, and so allows us to examine the effect of these on dementia more closely.’

Tim Frayling, professor of human genetics, University of Exeter Medical School, said: ‘The authors are not claiming that height directly alters risk of dementia. They are claiming something more subtle and less controversial – that height is a marker of early life factors which predict death from dementia.’
