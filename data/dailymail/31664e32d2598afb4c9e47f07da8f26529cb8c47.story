Astonishing new footage of the 2011 Japanese earthquake has been released and reveals in real time the panic caused as the 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit.

The dramatic video captures schoolchildren, office workers and parents with young children reacting to the force of the earthquake as it struck on March 11.

The collection of amateur film shows office workers diving under desks and heading for the emergency exits as the strength of the tremor scatters desks, computers and papers across the floor.

Hundreds of fans are shown sitting in a

crack within seconds of the earthquake hitting.

The footage provides a revealing insight into the immediate human reaction to the devastating natural disaster.

Almost 16,000 people died on March 11, 2011, when a huge earthquake struck off the coast of Japan about 70km from Tokyo and triggered a tsunami.

The waves, some reaching reported heights of 40metres, were responsible for the majority of deaths. 

It was most powerful earthquake to have ever hit Japan and one of the most powerful ever recorded anywhere in the world.

Almost two years after the disaster new footage is still emerging and has been compiled for a new Japanese documentary.
