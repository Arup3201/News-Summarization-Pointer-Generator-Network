The mother of missing girl Lisa Irwin has spoken of her ongoing anguish over the loss of her daughter - and revealed that she still looks into every passing stroller wondering if the child inside is actually hers.

Deborah Irwin also repeated how she regrets getting drunk with a friend on the night her daughter, aged just 10 months, vanished more than three years ago.

In a tearful interview alongside her husband Jeremy, she told how she felt kidnappers took advantage of a moment of weakness and snatched her child while she wasn't alert enough to react.

Tearful: Deborah Irwin spoke out in a Fox News interview - and said she still looks at girls in the street and wonders whether they are her missing daughter Lisa

Deborah remembers tucking her daughter in on October 4, 2011, then started drinking in the house with a friend, while Jeremy was working a night shift.

He came home to find the child missing, and despite years of searching neither they nor police have a clue what happened to her.

Speaking to Fox News anchor Megan Kelly, Deborah revealed how the loss still haunts her and has her constantly wondering whether children the age her daughter would be now - around four years old - are actually Lisa.

She told Kelly: 'I did it all day today when we were walking around before we came here to see you. We were standing on the corner and I see a little girl.'

'She was in her stroller, she was about Lisa's age, and I looked down at her and I said to Jeremy: "I'm really tired of looking at everybody else's kid hoping it's mine."'

Reward: A benefactor offered $100,000 for any information leading to Lisa's recovery. Police are said to be receiving around two leads per week in the case

The parents also said that they keep her room as it was when Lisa vanished - and keep filling in with presents after every birthday and Christmas for Lisa to open should she return.

Deborah said the room is a source of comfort to them. She said: 'It feels good to go in there, and smell her, and know that someday she's going to come home and she's gonna see all these presents and she's gonna be excited to open them and to watch her reaction and stuff like that.'

Police are still hunting for Lisa, and are called up with around two tips per week. A $100,000 reward has been posted for information leading to her safe return.

Recently a new missing poster was put out featuring a digital version of what her face may look like more than three years on, which Deborah and Jeremy hope will prompt more leads in the search.

However, the frantic night they realized their daughter was missing still haunts them, and their accounts have prompted waves of criticism from those who suspect or doubt their account. 

Returning to the desperate discovery that Lisa was missing, Deborah spoke of her biggest regret from that night - her decision to drink after putting Lisa to bed. She says the alcohol made her less alert for what she believes was a planned snatching.

She said: 'I wish I hadn't been drinking. I feel like it was planned and they were gonna take her... maybe if I hadn't been drinking I would have heard something and got up. I just feel like I didn't save her.'

Missing: Lisa's home is still plastered in missing posters, and signs referring to her pet name, Pumpkin
