A young woman diagnosed with cervical cancer managed to save her fertility as well as beat the disease after ignoring doctors' advice and seeking a second opinion.

Naomi Orme, 34, from Tamworth, West Midlands, feared the worst when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer just five months ago.

Doctors said her only chance of survival was to have a hysterectomy to remove her womb – but this would ruin her chances of ever becoming a mother.

Devastated - and desperate to keep her fertility  - Ms Orme began researching other options online.

Ms Orme (pictured before her diagnosis) was told her only option of survival was a hysterectomy to remove her womb, which would leave her infertile. Devastated, she began researching other options online

She found she was eligible for a second opinion and for a trachelectomy procedure. This removes the cervix and upper vagina, but leaves the womb in place so doesn't harm fertility (she is pictured before surgery)

The trachelectomy procedure to remove the cancerous tumour, is performed through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery.  Pictured are Ms Orme's scars following the operation, which was a success

She found she was entitled to a second opinion and that another operation existed that could cure her cancer but wouldn't destroy her chance of motherhood.

Ms Orme eventually underwent a trachelectomy – a procedure which removes the upper part of the vagina and the cervix, but without damaging fertility as the womb is left in place.

She documented her entire cancer journey through her blog and hopes that by sharing her story, other women will seek a second opinion.

Ms Orme, an air hostess, said: 'I am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the New Year.

'I still don't believe I've actually managed to beat cancer.

'Since my diagnosis in July, I have had to battle with doctors to get the right treatment plan.

'If I wasn't so persistent about getting a second opinion, I would be infertile now.

'Beating cancer was always my main goal but I wanted children in the future and I knew deep down there was a way to keep my dream alive.'

Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35.  

Ms Orme, who has never missed a regular smear test, first noticed something was wrong when she began bleeding after sex.

Ms Orme is now in remission, meaning she is cancer free, but will have to go for regular check ups every three months for the next two years. She is pictured here as a bridesmaid, before being diagnosed

Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35, according to Cancer Research UK. 

Rates of the disease had decreased by nearly half between the late 1980’s until the early 2000s.

But the last decade has seen an increase in rates in younger women.

The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus virus, which is spread during intercourse. 

Worldwide, more than 527,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2012, with incidence rates varying across the world.

Survival is higher in women diagnosed at a younger age. Ninety per cent of women diagnosed with cervical cancer under age 40 survive for at least five years. 

However women under 25 in the UK are not offered a smear test as cervical cancer is deemed so rare in women that young.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good.

However campaigners argue that with more young women suffering from the disease - the age should be lowered or smear tests at last be made available on request.  

She said: 'I'd had a smear test just eight months before so I wasn't too concerned but when it happened a second time I started to worry.

'I was living in Dubai at the time and two weeks later I booked in to see my regular doctor.

'Just weeks later I was diagnosed with cervical cancer, I booked a flight home the same day.

'I needed to be with my friends and family in England order to beat the disease.'

Terrified, she had to wait a week for an MRI scan before she was told how advanced her cancer was.

She said: 'I was luckily diagnosed with the early stages of cervical cancer but I still needed surgery to remove the tumour.

'I underwent a minor operation to remove the cancerous tissue from my cervix but doctors then found another deadly tumour.

'I was then told me that my only option of survival was to have a hysterectomy.

'I was devastated as I really want to be a mother one day and to have that suddenly ripped away from me was heart breaking.'

She urges other women in the same situation to seek a second opinion and carry out their own research, as this is how she found out about the trachelectomy surgery that meant she could save her fertility.

'After seeking a second opinion I found that I could keep my fertility, I was so relieved I burst into tears, it was life changing,' she said.

'I had wanted a trachelectomy from the beginning of my cancer journey but surgeons recommended the minor operation instead.

'I am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the New Year,' she said. She is pictured (left) celebrating the good news (right) in hospital for her trachelectomy procedure

For some women with a very early cancer of the cervix, it may be possible to have a trachelectomy.

In this type of surgery the cervix and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the rest of the uterus (womb) is left in place. 

The lymph glands in the pelvis are also removed. 

The operation may be done as an open operation of through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery

As the uterus is not removed, a trachelectomy allows for the possibility that the woman could have children. 

During the operation or during pregnancy, a stitch is made at the bottom of the uterus to keep it closed. 

There is a significantly higher chance of miscarriage or premature delivery after this procedure and the baby will be delivered early by Caesarean section.

Trachelectomy is only suitable for women with early stage cancer of the cervix.

This type of surgery is not common and is only done in Specialist Gynaecological Cancer Centres. 

Women interested in discussing this procedure should ask their gynaecologist to refer them to a specialist hospital.

'If I had just been given what I thought was best in the first place I wouldn't of had to go through two operations and weeks of sleepless nights.

She underwent the operation at the beginning of December and is now cancer free.

She said: 'I was so happy when I found out on December 18 that I was in the clear.

'It was a miracle that I had managed to keep my fertility but I fought so hard to be given the right procedure.

'I hope other women read my story and seek a second opinion, I have changed my future.

'Even though I've recently separated from my husband I hope one day to have children and that has always been something I have dreamed of.'

Ms Orme has documented her entire cancer journey online so she can help other women who are going through something similar.

She said: 'I started my blog just days after I was diagnosed, I was keen to get my thoughts written down.

'My experience of avoiding a hysterectomy was a difficult one, in some cases it can't be avoided but I would always recommend researching your options as it can be life changing.

She is now in remission, but will have regular check-ups every three months for the next two years.

'I can't wait to start 2015, I feel as though my life has just started over again and I'm excited to make plans for the New Year,' she said.

'When I was first diagnosed I never imaged I'd be cancer free and still able to have children just months later.'
