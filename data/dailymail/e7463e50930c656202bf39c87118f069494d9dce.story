NFL wide receiver Dont√© Stallworth has described the terrifying moment a romantic hot air balloon ride became a nightmare after it struck a power line, leaving him and his girlfriend covered in burns.

'It was the longest two or three second of my life,' he told ESPN. 'I literally thought I was dead.'

He also showed off the injuries that he and Soleil Guerrero suffered in the accident, which took place just south of Miami on March 16.

They shared images revealing their broken, charred skin and a picture of bandages covering Guerrero's entire body while she was being treated for third-degree burns.

Hurt: His girlfriend Soleil Guerrero was also in the basket when it hit a power line and she caught on fire

The start of the date - which had been arranged to celebrate Guerrero's 27th birthday - was peaceful, with the couple enjoying the views for more than an hour.

But things suddenly took a bad turn when the pilot told them they would not be able to land at their expected location - and Stallworth, 32, saw they were heading for powerlines.

'I became concerned when I was looking 
back behind me, and I saw that we were getting really close to the power
lines,' Stallworth told ESPN in his first interview about the accident.

'By the time I realized we were going to hit 
the power line, it was too late.'

When they hit the line, they were both electrocuted and Guerrero caught on fire in the corner of the basket.

'The shock felt like two or three seconds, but it was the longest two or three seconds of my life,' Stallworth said, adding that he was paralyzed by the shock.

'I started to get light-headed, and I 
remember telling myself, "Don't close your eyes, if you close your eyes 
you're going to die." I literally thought I was dead.'

Guerrero said she also believed they were going to die.

'I could feel the electricity... in 
my spine, from the top all the way through my body,' she said. 'I caught
on fire somehow. I couldn't believe how this was how it was going to 
end.'

Aftermath: The balloon's passenger basket crashed into electrical wires and then fell to the ground

The basket crashed to the ground and 
both were taken to hospital in a helicopter, and were treated with 
second- and third-degree burns. Guerrero's injuries were more severe.

After the basket crashed to the ground, both were airlifted to the hospital with second- and third-degree burns.

'This situation has made me realize that life is short,' he told ESPN.

Stallworth, a 10-year NFL veteran, is a free agent who played one game for the New England Patriots last season before he injured his ankle.

After the crash, his agent said he would not suffer permanent damage from the accident.

'He's going to be OK. He has some 
burns, but he's going to be fine,' Drew 
Rosenhaus told ESPN.

'He will be able to 
continue his NFL career. The injuries are not to the extent they will 
jeopardize his career.'

According to Miami-Dade Police 
spokesman Roy Rutland, the basket carrying the three passengers crashed 
into the power lines while airborne at Southwest 217th Avenue and 
Southwest 296th Street.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
