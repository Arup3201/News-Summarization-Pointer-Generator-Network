Scottish club Hibernian moved to clarify that they haven't made a bid for convicted rapist Ched Evans. 

The former Sheffield United striker is in fact a target for Maltese outfit Hibernians, who share a similar name to that of Alan Stubbs' side. 

And they are said to have offered Evans a deal for the remainder of the season.

Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans

The Scottish Championship side tweeted on Friday night: 'Just to clarify, we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. 

'See you the morn, HFC.' 

Malta's Hibernians, 15 points clear at the top of the country's domestic league having dropped just two points in 16 games, are keen, with club vice-president Stephen Vaughan saying: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill.

'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' 

Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close.

'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.'

He added on Sky News HD: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.'

Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.'

While reports that Evans might sign with a club in England set off a storm of controversy, Farrugia believed there would be no such reaction in Malta.

'We have no problem with that,' he said. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football.

'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.'

He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.' 

Evans scored 48 goals in 113 for Sheffield United before being convicted in 2012

Farrugia also believes that by moving to Malta, Evans can put himself in the shop window for other clubs.

He said: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football.

'(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.'

Scottish Championship side Hibernian took to Twitter to ease fans' fears that they had made an offer to Evans, posting: 'Just to clarify we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you in the morn, HFC'. 

Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. 

He was initially given permission by League One Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players' union, the Professional Footballers Association. 

But following a backlash from Blades supporters, sponsors and patrons opposed to Evans' return - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted the offer.

Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claimed the League Two club turned down an approach from associates of Evans' about the possibility of him playing for the club, before League One Oldham last month denied reports they had offered Evans the opportunity to train with the club.
