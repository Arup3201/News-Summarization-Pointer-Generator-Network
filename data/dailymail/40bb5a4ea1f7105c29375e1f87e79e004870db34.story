Most family disputes don't make headlines. But most families don't have the last name of Guggenheim, and most disputes aren't over an art collection forth tens of millions of dollars.

But that's exactly what's about to play out in a French courtroom after descendents of eccentric, millionaire art collector Peggy Guggenheim decided to sue the Guggenheim Foundation - to which Peggy left her vast collection of expensive art - over claims that the foundation is not honoring the wishes of the deceased heiress.

Essentially, the family feels the foundation is cheapening the collection by allowing other artists to display their collections at an Italian palazzo in Venice that was left to the foundation as part of the collection.

Dispute: The center of the dispute is this palazzo in Venice Guggenheim left to the Guggenheim Foundation

The palazzo is actually home to the tomb of Peggy Guggenheim - and 14 of her dogs.

The last straw for the family appears to have come when the foundation put the names of Rudolph and Hannelore Schulhof on an entrance to the palazzo that also has the name of Guggenheim - and dogs with names like Cappuccino and Sir; Guggenheim's 'beloved babies,' according to the New York Times.

The Schulhofs are the parents of Guggenheim Foundation trustee Michael Schulof, who included some of his family's collection with Guggenheim's at the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in Venice.

As is: The family claims the collection was to stay as it was when Guggenheim owned it, and the addition of names and artwork go against her wishes

'They are totally disrespecting my great grandmother’s legacy,' Guggenheim's great grandson Sindbad Rumney, 27, told The Independent. 'Basically…
 if you have [enough] money and you have a collection, you can show it 
at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice.'

Guggenheim left her collection - at the time worth about $40 million - the the foundation in 1975, four years before her 1979 death.

The family claims that the collection was given to the foundation on the condition that it stay together and not be altered in any way - not only does the family claim that pieces of the collection cannot be sold, they also claim pieces can't be added to the collection.

According to the family, of the 181 pieces currently on display at the palazzo, 75 are from the recently added Schulhof collection.

Additionally, the family also accuses the foundation of desecrating Guggenheim's grave because her tomb is in the palazzo in what is now a 'sculpture garden' that is often used for cocktail parties.

What once was Guggenheim's grave is now 'The Nasher Sculpture Garden' - named after Texas billionaires Patsy and Raymond Nasher.

Rumney's mother, art writer Laurence Tacou, told Paris Match that the foundation was using the Venice palazzo as 'an extraordinary cash machine' and that it should be turned over to a non-profit committee.

The foundation, however, claims there were no specific demands made by Guggenheim about how her collection was to be used.

Memorial: The names of some of Guggenheim's dogs - like Cappuccino and Sir - can also be found at the palazzo

'[Our] efforts have only honoured, preserved and enhanced the memory and
 reputation of Peggy Guggenheim,' Betsy Ennis, a Guggenheim 
spokeswoman, told The Independent.

Why is a dispute over something in Italy being resolved in a French court? As the publication explains, 'Like any good family quarrel, this one goes back a long way. The French 
judicial system declared itself competent to intervene when two 
“branches” of the Guggenheim family last fell out 22 years ago. Seven of
 Peggy Guggenheim’s Paris-based descendants have now asked the French 
courts to intervene again.'
