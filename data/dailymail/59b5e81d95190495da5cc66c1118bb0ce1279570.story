A holistic approach which sees face-to-face consultations with specially trained experts is behind the success of this year's CSIRO diet.

The CSIRO Simply Well diet book is the most successful weight-loss book in Australia and now in its 9th year, people can visit their local chemist to sign up to its Impromy Health and Weight Management Program.

As part of the program, experts are on-hand to check, guide and support people through their weight-loss journey in a pharmacy setting, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair.

The diet program features face-to-face consultations and testing to provide feedback on cholesterol and blood sugar levels

The program is designed to keep people focused on losing weight and has been hailed a success by the people it has help shed tens of kilograms

Adelaide CSIRO professor Manny Noakes was involved one-year of testing the program at laboratories and pharmacies.

She said there were a range of positive results for people on the program. 'People really do see very immediate changes to their blood pressure and blood cholesterol even in the first couple of weeks,' she said. 'That can be very motivating for people.'

Designed to keep people focused on losing weight, the program is being hailed a success by the people it has help shed tens of kilograms.Â 

Rhonda has been a client of the program and lost 12 kilos in 12 weeks following recipes in the book and going to the consultations.

In the same period her blood pressure dropped from 141/100 to 119/78 and her cholesterol went from 5.2 to 3.9.

She said called the results 'beautiful' and said it had given her more energy than what she previously had.

'You feel good about yourself,' Rhonda said.

During the program, participants are tested to check their progress and to give them current feedback by measuring cholesterol and blood sugar levels and guiding clients through the stages of the program.

'You can't do it alone, people do need the support of someone who's trained and can help motivated them,' Ms Noakes said.

'This isn't about wielding a stick over people - it's about helping them through that journey and making them feel empowered in the process.'

Other new elements of the diet are scientifically-formulated shakes and soups used as breakfast or lunch meal replacements as well as snacks.

The shakes are designed to people on the diet boost their weight loss.

'What we generally see is a healthy weightless of about a kilo of week and that's maintained up to a six month period.

Recipes include Middle Eastern shepherd's pie, warm chicken salad and other high-protein meals.

There is a focus on preservative and trans fat-free foods with fresh and affordable ingredients. 'If I can do this recipe, anyone can,' Rhonda said.

After a six month trial 70 per cent of people were still sticking to the diet.

A CSIRO-developed mobile phone app also provides ongoing support and personalised feedback for those using the program.
