At the end of the best year of her career, Jordanne Whiley's return to the Olympic Park this week gives her the chance to put the cherry on the cake.

Whiley, a bronze medallist at the London 2012 Paralympics, competes on home soil this week at the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters not just as a Grand Slam champion, but as the first ever British player to complete a calendar Grand Slam.

The 22-year-old was victorious in the women's wheelchair doubles with Japanese partner Yui Kamiji this year at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and then handled the pressure to make history at the US Open.

Whiley said: 'That was the most pressure I've ever felt because during the couple of weeks leading up to the US Open there was a lot of media attention around me saying "oh, if you win it's going to be history".

'It was going to be really disappointing if I got so far and didn't win the calendar Grand Slam. There was a lot of pressure and I definitely felt it but we managed to overcome it so that was good.'

Whiley admits the calendar Grand Slam was discussed with Kamiji at the start of the year but it was more in jest rather than it being a serious goal at that point.

She said: 'I said to Yuri going into the Australian Open that we could do the calendar Grand Slam but it was a bit of banter, a bit of seriousness.

'It was only really when we won the Australian Open that we really had that in our minds that that was going to be our goal this year.'

Whiley considers herself fortunate to have the opportunity to play at the four most iconic tennis venues in the world in Melbourne Park, Roland Garros, the All England Club and Flushing Meadows.

And part of the fun also is bumping into some of the professionals in the locker room.

Whiley said: 'I have said hello to a few of the guys. I met Martina Navratilova when I was a kid and I saw her at the changing rooms at the Australian Open this year and I said hi to her and had a little conversation.

'They are always really pleasant and you can always approach them to say hello, so it's really nice.'

Whiley returns this week to the venue formerly known as Eton Manor where she won bronze with Lucy Shuker in the women's doubles at the 2012 Paralympics.

This week, Whiley faces a tough task against the rest of the top eight women's wheelchair singles players but she is relishing the opportunity to play at a venue which means so much.

She said: 'The court that we won on is now a hockey pitch. We are playing on the indoor courts but it's the same venue so it will be nice to go back and relive some memories.' 

The NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters takes place at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from November 26-30. For more information, visit www.wheelchairtennismasters.com
