An elderly couple have had their festive spirit dampened after a thief stole their display of Christmas lights.

For the last ten years, Neville and Maureen Hoyland created their own version of the town's famous illuminations at their home in Blackpool, Lancashire.

But this year, a mean-spirited thief has taken £500 of lighting from outside their home as they slept.

Festive: Mr and Mrs Hoyland have been decorating their house in Blackpool, Lancashire, for ten years

Gone: The lights were removed over one night even though they were secured to the house and fence

Mr Hoyland, 74, said: 'The sad thing about it is we are near a school and a lot of people come with their kids through this way as a short cut and they all  stop and enjoy the decorations.

'We have got grandchildren who have grown up with them every year.

'They still come round and have Christmas dinner here.

'The lights are for our pleasure and other people's pleasure too.'

The couple woke up to discover the decorations had disappeared, despite being securely fastened to their property.

Mr Hoyland added: 'The decorations have been going up for the last ten years and we have never had any trouble.

Bright: Before the lights were stolen Mr Hoyland said they had a snowman, a train and other decorations

Illuminations: Mr Hoyland said they had built up the collection over the years for their grandchildren

'It is a quiet, lovely area here, with a lot of retired people, so you just don't expect it.

'It
 took me three and a half hours to put everything up and it would not 
have been a quick job to take them down - it's very frustrating.

'They were really securely fastened to the wrought iron railings at the front of the house.

'I'm surprised they weren't spotted because the lighting system here is brilliant and we have got one right in front of our house.

'I've also spoken to our milkman, who delivers at 2am, and he said the decorations were still up then.'

Police confirmed they are investigating the theft.
