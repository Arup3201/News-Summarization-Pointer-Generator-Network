Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are.

Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet.

The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting -  are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle.

But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual.

Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them.

Scientists studying the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools.

The analysis began when one chimp called Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female.

Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges.

Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way.

The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge.

A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first.

By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'naïve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour.

This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role. 

The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts.

Dr Katie Slocombe, a psychologist at the University of York who led the study, said she found she was able to identify individual chimps from their drumming style.

She believes her findings may also provide clues about how musical rhythm first began among humans.

She told the Mail Online: 'I wanted to know why the chimps choose to drum with some pant hoots and not others and whether drumming rhythms were individually distinctive.

The drums contain cues to individual identity – so chimps hundreds of meters away should be able to use drums to understand the location of individuals in the forest.

'The sound they create makes it ideal for long distance communication.

'We think drums help coordinate movement and grouping patterns, so advertising to others your location when travelling may entice others to join you, and other chimps may pant hoot and drum back, which may influence where the caller decides to travel to.'

Speaking to the journal Science, she added: 'This shows that rhythmic abilities are not uniquely human.'Coordinating movement over very long distances might have been why the earliest humans started to drum.'Chimpanzees can roam over territories the size of Manhattan Island, which can make it difficult for the chimps to find each other.They are known to use a series of hoots and bellows to communicate with each other, but some scientists have seen some males aggressively beat tree roots too.It was thought that this might be a way of showing dominance by the male chimpanzees.

However, Dr Slocombe and her colleague's research, which a troop of chimpanzees for three years, suggests that this is not the case.

Their study, which is published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, analysed the social context of 293 hooting and drumming events by the troop's 13 males.

They found that while the older more experienced males did drum more than other troop members, their rank and whether other males or females were nearby played little role.

Instead, the decision to drum seemed to be more influenced by what the group were doing.

If they were travelling, chimps drummed buttresses in 75 per cent of pant hoots but only 40 per cent of the time when resting and 10 per cent of the time when eating. 

Dr Slocombe found that travelling males tended to have their own distinctive flair. Recordings showed that the length of time each chimp spent drumming, their use for doublets and pauses and the number of beats varied by each animal.

Using computer software the researchers were able to identify the drummer 47 per cent of the time.

Dr Slocombe said: 'Drumming sequences produced with pant hoots may have contained information on individual identity and that qualitatively, there was individual variation in the complexity of the temporal patterns produced.

'We conclude that drumming patterns may act as individually distinctive long-distance signals that, together with pant hoot vocalizations, function to coordinate the movement and spacing of dispersed individuals within a community.'

She added that such behaviour could also be important in helping to allow rival chimpanzees keep their distance by knowing who is where.

The root drumming behaviour was only seen to be carried out by male chimps like the one above, but did not appear to be intended as a way of exerting dominance over others in their group in the area or to attract a mate

Magdalena Babiszewska, a PhD student at the University of Wrocław in Poland who also took part in the study, said: 'Chimps are amazing with their drumming ability, so we cannot say that they lack of musicality.

'The jungle is pretty busy and loud place so I assume that loud, structured drum is better recognised than vocalization, so why not to use it when you are away from your friends for several days.

'We have still a lot to discover in terms of chimpanzees behavior and music evolution.'
