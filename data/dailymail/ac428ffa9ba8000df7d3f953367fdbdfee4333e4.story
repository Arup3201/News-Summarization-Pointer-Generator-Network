Thousands of volunteers began a huge clean-up of Britain’s beaches yesterday.

Marks & Spencer has mobilised 4,500 staff to join local residents in mounting litter patrols on 100 of the country’s beaches.

The store is one of many businesses to have backed the Daily Mail’s Spring Clean for the Queen campaign, pledging to do its best to rid our environment of litter in the run-up to the main Jubilee celebrations next month.

The M&S staff – drawn from every level of the company – are joining an expected 3,000 community volunteers to clear beaches over the weekend.

Mucking in: Volunteers from Marks & Spencer help with the clean-up at Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex

Yesterday saw a combined total of some 4,000 staff and residents rally to the cause at the first 36 beaches on their hit list, including Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, Sand Bay near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, and Cramond in Edinburgh.

Between them, they filled 1,500 black bin bags with rubbish weighing 5,500kg. That included around 1,600 tin cans and 7,350 wrappers. 

The good spirit and fun of the operation was perfectly illustrated at Shoreham, where, despite blustery winds, around 150 people collected 31 black bin bags  full of litter weighing a total of 46.25kg in just over an hour, covering a mile stretch.

Graphic designer Lisa Doyle, 32, who had donned pink wellies to help out, said: ‘When we first  got here and looked at the beach it didn’t look like it had any litter on it at all.

'But when you start looking really close, you realise there’s all these little bits all over the place.’

Chloe Gray, 34, who works in M&S’s fish team, said: ‘It was mostly plastic, but we were amazed at some of the stuff we found... which included a pink thong.

‘It’s been a great day and it feels good to do your bit for the environment and help keep the  country clean.’

Shoreham is a shingle beach dotted with vegetation, including sea kale and curled dock.

It is one of only a few of its kind in the UK, New Zealand and Japan and is a Site of Special  Scientific Interest. 

Children from three schools also helped out there, using metal detectors to locate cans and aerosols while enjoying a sunny day out of the classroom at the seaside.

Laura Hollis, ten, from Glebe Primary School, said: ‘It was fun and we liked helping. We know it’s bad if people leave these things on the beach because they can stay around for ages.’

As well as being a blot on the coastline, much of the rubbish found at Shoreham, as elsewhere, would be harmful to birds and fish should they swallow it or become trapped in it.

Among the unusual items discovered on beaches during yesterday’s operation were a set of false teeth, a pair of tights, a baseball, various odd socks, a jumper, and some plastic ‘vampire fangs’.

All the litter collectors at each beach were issued with gloves, litter pickers and bin bags. The collected rubbish was later handed over to councils for disposal.

The M&S Big Beach Clean-Up project is run in conjunction with the Marine Conservation Society and is in its first year.

Bosses organised the events in response to surveys by the MCS,  which showed litter levels on beaches were unacceptably high.

Andy Bool, head of fundraising at the MCS, said most – around 60 per cent – of the litter found on UK beaches is plastic such as bottle tops and cable ties, followed by food wrappers, then rope from the fishing industry or sea anglers’ discarded line.

Richard Gillies, director of M&S’s ethical programme Plan A, said: ‘Our customers care passionately about where their food comes from, especially fish.

‘We only source from the most sustainable sources, but this is something more, this is our chance to get out on to beaches with our customers and take direct action to help protect marine life and our coastline.’

The operation is funded by the 5p carrier bag charge in M&S foodhalls, launched to combat the chronic number of bags littering our streets and waterways.

Since its introduction in 2008, the charge has reduced carrier bag use by 80 per cent and raised over £4million for charity.

M&S has pledged to give every volunteer who registers in advance a money-off voucher and provide snacks during the clean, which continues at locations around the country today and tomorrow.
