A video shows the incredible moment a female Good Samaritan bravely defends a Papa John's store from looters during riots that turned parts of Ferguson, Missouri, into an urban warzone.

The unarmed woman is seen using her hands to guide a masked man away from the storefront, after he starts punching the windows in an attempt to smash the glass.

She places her body between the store and the man and appears to be trying to reason with the looter, who squares up to her and jabs his finger aggressively in her face.

The looter continues raining blows on the storefront, kicking the glass furiously. He is joined by a second man who shouts in her face, but she refuses to back down.

Both looters seem to get angrier, and the masked man pushes the woman aggressively, before raising his fists at her. But he then backs off and is led away by the other man. 

In the background, a female voice can be heard shouting at the woman to 'move!' and telling her that 'this ain't your business.' 

Many at first thought the woman was an employee at Papa John's but that is not in fact the case.

'A lost of people thought it was the General Manager because we have a female GM,' store employee Jon Smith told MailOnline.

He then added, 'We sent everyone home between 7:00 and 8:00 to be safe Monday night, and this happened after that.'

He then said how much he admired the woman for protecting the store.

'For someone who has no vested interest to protect the store like that is amazing.'

The woman's identity is still unknown, even to employees at Papa John's

This same Papa John's was looted back in August in the immediate aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting, with the windows broken and goods stolen from inside.

Papa John's was one of the only businesses that suffered no damage in that section of West Florissant Avenue on Monday evening, with the Fashions R Boutique, a Title Max and an Auto Zone going up in flames.

Past looting: The Papa John's was looted back in August after the Michael Brown shooting

This as demonstrators in Ferguson broke windows at City Hall Tuesday night and set a squad car on fire, thought the protests were far less destructive than the previous night..

By the end of the night 45 people had been arrested in Ferguson, most for failure to disperse, though at least one person was taken in after being part of a group that was throwing smoke bombs, flares and frozen water bottles at a line of officers.

Some protesters also threw rocks, tent poles, and bottles - some containing urine - at officers.

It also came as tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict for a second night.

Enraged protesters set fire to buildings, and looted businesses in an orgy of violence and destruction

Within 30 minutes of the news that a grand jury had decided a white police officer Darren Wilson would not face criminal charges for shooting dead 18-year-old Michael Brown, the suburb and surrounding areas of the city of St Louis erupted on Monday evening.

At least one man died in a night of arson, looting, random gunfire and pitched battles, with heavily armed riot police unable to cope with the scale of the mayhem. 

Enraged protesters set fire to buildings and cars, and looted businesses in an orgy of violence and destruction. 

Protected by armored personnel carriers, police replied with tear gas and pepper spray, which made eyes and lungs burn.

This week, despite being bolstered by National Guard soldiers who had largely been deployed away from the trouble, overstretched police were unable to control the disorder, leaving streets lawless for long periods.

During the violence a black 20-year-old shop assistant, DeAndre Joshua, was shot dead in his car in an apparent robbery. Fourteen other people were injured.

In many cases, it was too dangerous for overstretched fire crews to reach the buildings and they were left to burn.

Rows of parked vehicles were also set on fire with lighter fluid, including two police patrol cars. Rioters hurled bricks and rocks at officers. 

Sporadic gunfire - police counted 150 rounds - could be heard throughout the night. Some sounded like it came from automatic weapons, though the police insisted they had not used their own firearms.

In the mayhem, looters moved in unmolested, robbing everything from an off licence to a branch of Toys R Us. A shop where Michael Brown had allegedly stolen some small cigars shortly before he was shot dead was also targeted by a crowd of looters.

Others protested peacefully, chanting: ‘Hands up, don’t shoot. No justice, no peace.’ Some rioters paused to explain that, since they hadn’t got justice over Michael Brown, there would be no peace in this town.

This woman was not an employee at Papa John's, but a Good Samaritan trying to protect the store
