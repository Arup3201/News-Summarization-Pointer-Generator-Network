They've lost parents, survived a financial crash and had a ringside view of the upheavals, deaths, births and intrigues that go on within Downton Abbey.

Luckily for the show's youngest stars, Oliver and Zac Barker, three, and Fifi Hart, four, the drama ends when the cameras stop rolling, although there's plenty of the former coming up in series five.

But the new season will also see the junior members of the Crawley dynasty make their presence felt, as a new set of photos released by ITV reveals.

Starring role: Four-year-old Fifi Hart (pictured with Allen Leech) will play Sybbie Benson in the new series

Adorable: Zac and Oliver Barker, three, share the role of Master George Crawley

Gone are the chubby babies of last season and in their place, a tiny version of Matthew Crawley, so memorably killed off at the end of season three, and a little Lady Sybil with a stylish 1920s bob.

So who are the young stars of Downton Abbey? Four-year-old Fifi, who hails from the Isle of Wight, has already racked up an impressive list of credits, despite her tender years.

She made her acting debut in Harry Enfield's comedy series Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul before going on to star in Enfield's tribute to BBC2, Harry and Paul's Story of the Twos, in May.

And Fifi isn't the only member of the Hart family with designs on an acting career.

Her older sister Mimi, 11, has enjoyed a varied career with appearances on radio and on TV with Vernon Kay among her credits.

She is also to star in Where the Land Meets the Sea, a short film by acclaimed director Christina Hardinge, whose credits include music videos, theatre and a series of live performances at the Whitechapel Gallery in London.

By contrast, Oliver and Zac Barker are completely unknown although both bear an uncannily close resemblance to their on-screen father, the late Matthew Crawley.

New series: Filming for season five has taken the cast to Northumberland and the majestic Alnwick Castle

Whatever their pedigree, all three are set to play a
 central part in the action during season five, with ITV promising 'touching scenes' between little Sybiie and her on-screen father, former chauffeur Tom Branson.

Speaking ahead of the new series, Allen Leech, who plays Branson, said: ‘Tom’s place is now at the Abbey – even he would admit that.’

Like his cousin Sybbie, heir apparent to the Earldom, Master George, also has a parent struggling to come to terms with the death of the other one.

According to producers, Lady Mary will spend the next series battling to put the death of her husband Matthew Crawley behind her in order to do the best for her son.

What does it all mean? Cast members Laura Carmichael (Lady Edith) and Lily James (Lady Rose) at Alnwick
