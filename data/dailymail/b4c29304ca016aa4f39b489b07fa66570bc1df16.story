This Argentinian naked chef is giving Jamie Oliver a run for his money with her saucy take on cooking that usually involves her covering up her assets with items of food.

The 24-year-old cook, known as Jenn to her fans, offers very simple recipes compared to the creations of Jamie Oliver, but nevertheless she has managed to build up a huge fan base with a series of YouTube videos offering 'quick and simple recipes'.

She said: 'I had a male friend who only ever wanted to eat fast food, and it's a problem many men have. But I want to show them that cooking is fun and to encourage more men to get involved in learning about recipes and preparation of food.

A-peeling: Jenn has built up a huge YouTube following

The programmer, who has an interest in amateur theatre, is now seriously considering a career as a presenter after building up a huge fan base.

And although the recipes usually work first time, the only difficulty she ever has is in the camera angles.

She says: 'Sometimes we have to make sure we film the same scene a dozen times just to make sure everything is properly covered by food so that we don't breach YouTube rules on nudity. But I don't care, it's really good fun making the videos and am really glad that they've gone down so well.'
