Gunmen in Pakistan attacked a training facility for airport police near the Karachi airport on Tuesday, forcing a temporary suspension of flights and triggering a brief shootout with security forces just days after a brazen Taliban assault on the country's busiest airfield.

Law enforcement personnel managed to quickly repulse the attack by as many as three gunmen, an assault claimed by a resurgent Taliban who warned its violence ‘wasn't over yet.’

Television stations aired footage of security guards frantically taking up positions behind buildings or earthen berms at the training facility, roughly half a mile from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. The Pakistani military also sent soldiers to assist.

A spokesman for the Airport Security 
Force, Ghulam Abbas Memon, said two to three gunmen tried to enter the 
training academy from two different entrances.

‘Our
 men retaliated and repulsed’ the gunmen, Memon said. Security forces 
chased the men to a drainage ditch where another firefight ensued but 
the gunmen escaped, he said.

Col.
 Tahir Ali, a senior official with the Airport Security Force, said two 
militants fired toward a hostel for female employees on the academy 
grounds. He said no one was hurt in the incident.

The
 Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for running the 
country's airports, initially said on Twitter that all flights at the 
airport were suspended but later reported that operations had resumed.

‘The
 aim of the attackers was to create a panic, and we shouldn't be playing
 into their hands,’ the head of airport force, Azam Khan, told Pakistani
 television.

The attack comes less than two days after gunmen laid siege to the Karachi airport in an attack that left 36 people dead, including 10 Taliban gunmen

The attackers 
retreated into the vast slum that borders the airport. Karachi is a 
sprawling city of at least 18 million people, and members of the 
Pakistani Taliban in recent years have migrated to the city from the 
northwest to escape military operations and drone strikes there. The 
result has been a steep deterioration in Karachi's security.

Tuesday's
 firefight came on the heels of a brazen siege Sunday night by 10 
Taliban fighters who stormed a VIP and cargo terminal at the Karachi 
airport in an attack that killed 26 people and the Taliban gunmen. At 
least 11 members of the Airport Security Force were killed during that 
attack.

Pakistani 
authorities discovered more bodies from that siege Tuesday morning. 
Airport authorities found seven bodies in a burned building at the 
airport, charred beyond recognition, said the head of the Karachi 
Municipal Corporation, Rauf Akhtar Farooqi.

The
 discovery of the bodies, roughly a day after Pakistani officials said 
the airport had been secured, will raise more questions about security 
at the country's busiest airport.

Relatives of the dead reported receiving telephone calls from their loved ones trapped inside the burning building.

‘The
 last I spoke to him, he said there was intense firing going on and that
 a building was also on fire,’ said Junaidul Haq, whose brother died. He
 said his brother told him that he was trapped with several of his 
colleagues.

Pakistani media reported that the seven were airport workers who hid from the fighting but got trapped and burned to death.

The
 head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mohammad Yusuf, said authorities 
tried to reach the building that was on fire twice during the siege but 
both times shots were fired on their vehicles. After security officials 
cleared the airport, they went back to search the building because there
 were reports of people trapped inside.

The
 Pakistani Taliban has been trying to overthrow the government and 
establish its hard-line rule across the country. The government of Prime
 Minister Nawaz Sharif repeatedly has tried to negotiate with the 
militants to end the fighting but those efforts have collapsed.

The
 airport attack, coming against a high-profile target in a city vital to
 the country's economy, has raised questions about whether Sharif will 
continue to pursue the negotiations policy or choose a more aggressive, 
military response.

Early 
Tuesday, Pakistani military airstrikes targeted the Tirah Valley in the 
country's northwest. The military said it killed 25 suspected militants 
in strikes on nine hideouts, but the information could not be 
independently verified. The area is part of a lawless terrain along the 
Afghan border that is home to a mix of local militants and 
al-Qaida-linked foreign fighters.
