Michael Strahan's new deal to work on Good Morning America has been unveiled as he joined his future co-anchors for a brief introduction this morning.

The former NFL player will be joining the morning news show 'several days a week' but will continue co-hosting 'Live with Kelly and Michael' every day.

Both 'Live' and Good Morning America are ABC programs and the anchors regularly fill in for one another when on sick leave, but this is the most permanent connection between the two staffs.

A part of the family: Michael Strahan (right) will be joining Good Morning America 'a few days' a week while still keeping his full time gig as a co-host on ABC's 9am talk show 'Live with Kelly and Michael'

George Stephanopoulos specifically cited 'the way that you and Kelly (Ripa) all stepped in while Robin (Roberts) was away with her transplant' as an example of how Strahan was already a part of the show.

'It's a family and we appreciate you guys too,' Strahan said of him and Ripa.

His introduction at the top of GMA's second hour this morning was brief- with a crowd cheering him in and gag gifts like an alarm clock and a giant coffee mug from his new colleagues- because he had to get out of the studio quickly to head uptown to the 'Live' studios to be there in time for the 9am show.

When he sat down next to Ripa on 'Live' an hour later, he said that the introduction was 'good, it was quick'.

'Hopefully it's a match made in heaven,' he said.

Strahan will formally start with GMA next week, working for the morning show a few times a week, but no one specified what time and filming constraints would be imposed in order for him to make his double shifts work.

Pre-taped segments with live introductions, creative use of the various ABC studios in Manhattan, and scheduling Strahan in the first hour of GMA could all be used as possible ways to make the situation work.

Earlier wake ups: The GMA co-hosts wake up between 2.45am and 3.45am to be ready for the 7am start to the show, so they welcomed Strahan to their ranks with a few helpful gifts

The addition of Strahan to the Good Morning America crew became more and more likely ever since Josh Elliott left on March 30.

Strahan took over as Regis Philbin's permanent replacement in September 2012 and the show's audience responded with a strong ratings surge.

Reports surfaced two weeks ago that the 42-year-old was in talks to join the GMA cast because Elliott's defection to NBC Sports left Stephanopoulos the only male co-host.

Now GMA is headed by Stephanopoulos, Roberts, Lara Spencer, Amy Robach and Ginger Zee who replaced Sam Champion when he left in December to head up his own program on The Weather Channel.

In the days immediately after Elliott's surprise departure, Strahan told the 'Live' audience that while he had gone for meetings with ABC executives about him working on GMA, nothing had been finalized and no version of the deal would result in him leaving the 9am talk show.

Back in his chair: Strahan, seen on the 'Live' set this morning following the GMA debut, said that they hope the partnership with GMA will be 'a match made in heaven'

'This is what I do. This is me. This is my home. I love you,' he said to Ripa on air on April 2.

Strahan already has a second job as a co-host on Fox NFL Sunday during football season, and he hinted that he plans to keep those ties strong though the evening filming schedule of the football program could cause an interference with his new extra-early morning wake ups.

Details of his contract have also not been revealed, but in an earlier New York Times interview, Strahan's Fox NFL Sunday co-host Terry Bradshaw joked that Strahan was making $16million as a result of his 'Live' deal.

Strahan wouldn't comment on his salary but brushed it off saying 'that's just Terry being a knucklehead. I wouldnâ€™t tell him what I was making because he might ask me for a loan.'
