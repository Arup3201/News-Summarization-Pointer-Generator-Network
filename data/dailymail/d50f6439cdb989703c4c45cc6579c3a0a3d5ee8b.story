They may have fled to safety, but these Syrian Kurds can't help but look back over the border they just crossed to watch their brothers-in-arms fight for the land they left behind.

In the last week alone, more than 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the  Islamic State fighters laying siege to their hometown, Kobani, some 15 miles to the south.

But while they are now safe, the war rages on as Kurdish Peshmerga warriors - backed by U.S. airstrikes - fight to hold their murderous enemy at bay.

Nervous: They may have escaped to freedom, but these Syrian Kurds can't help but look back over the border they just crossed to cheer on their brothers fighting back the jihadis overrunning their homeland

What they could see: This is how close the town of Ayn al-Arab is to the Turkish border

Close contact: In Sanlinurfa, Turkey, men climbed a hill with binoculars and watched the battle for the town of Ayn al-Arab unfold little more than a mile in the distance

Fear for their homes: Some 15 miles beyond that, smoke could be seen rising from Kobani, from which many of these refugees fled when the IS horde breached the town's defences

Smoke rising: Smoke rises from Ayn al-Arab city following shelling during clashes between Islamic State  and Kurdish armed troops

In Sanlinurfa, men climbed a hill with binoculars and nervously watched  the battle for the town of Ayn al-Arab unfold little more than a mile in the distance.

Some 15 miles beyond that, they could see smoke rising from  Kobani, the town from which most of these refugees fled when the IS horde breached the town's defences. 

Turkey had taken in well over a million Syrian refugees from the three-and-a-half year-old conflict already before the latest wave, but this influx is the largest yet, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.

Several hundred thousand refugees are reportedly still in Kobani and aid agencies are bracing for a massive exodus into Turkey. 

U.S.-led airstrikes and soldiers from the Peshmerga have managed to hold the brutal Islamic extremists back for now, but there are fears they could still take the town.

If that happens, many Kurds fear they will be massacred in the same way the Yazidis were after IS fighters seized Sinjar last month, forcing them to scatter into the hills. 

Safe at last: Some 150,000 Kurdish men, women and children have already crossed into Sanlinurfa, Turkey, to escape the onslaught on Kobani by Islamic State fighters

Influx: Syrian refugees carry their belongings at a border crossing point after crossing from Syria into Turkey in Yumurtalik, south of Sanliurfa, Turkey

So they fled to Turkey where they were met by barbed wire, soldiers and tanks as fears over the scale of this refugee crisis grew.

Turkish tanks took up positions along the Syrian frontier, opposite besieged Kobani where Islamic State shelling intensified and stray fire hit Turkish soil.

U.S.-led air strikes overnight hit a natural gas plant controlled by Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria, a monitoring body reported, part of an apparent campaign to disrupt one of the fighters' main sources of income.

The monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said planes also struck a grain silo in northern Syria killing civilians. This could not be immediately confirmed.

Getting ready? President Tayyip Erdogan, until now reluctant to commit to a frontline military role in the U.S.-led campaign against IslamicState, has said Turkish troops could be used to help set up such a zone

More tanks: At least 15 Turkish tanks were positioned at the frontier, some with guns pointed towards Syrian territory

U.S.-led strikes have so far failed to halt an advance by fighters in northern Syria on Kobani, a Kurdish town on the border with Turkey where the past week's battle caused the fastest refugee flight of Syria's three-year civil war.

At least 15 Turkish tanks were positioned at the frontier, some with guns pointed towards Syrian territory. More tanks and armoured vehicles moved towards the border after shells landed in Turkey on Sunday and Monday.

Among the 150,000 Kurds to arrive in Turkey in the last week is Mohammed Muslim. Dressed in a battered suit, his moustache flecked
with grey, he is distraught about having to leave, but fears what would have happened to him if he had stayed.

'I don't want to be in Turkey, I want to be in my village, I
want to die in Kobani,' Muslim said, running prayer beads
through his hands as he watched Kurdish and Islamic State
fighters exchange fire in the valley below.'

He added: 'If the war goes our way, then of course we'll go home, but
it looks like it will be difficult.'

Turkish police in the area have another fight on their hands as hundreds of Turkish Kurds descend on the Syria-Turkey frontier in the hope of joining the fight against IS

The Turkish government does not want its citizen Kurds joining the Peshmerga and are on standby ready to stop any groups attempting to cross into Syria

Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees
from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its
allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian
territory. A safe haven along the border would require a no-fly
zone policed by foreign jets.

President Tayyip Erdogan, until now reluctant to commit to a
frontline military role in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic
State, has said Turkish troops could be used to help set up such
a zone.

Meanwhile, Turkey has deployed riot police at the Mursitpinar crossing gate near the Syrian border in the southeastern town of Suruc to stop Syrian refugees entering Turkey.

U.S. air strikes have hit Islamic State targets around 140
km to the south of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, in the
militant group's heartland of Raqqa, and on Saturday also hit
sites to the east of the town.

But the heavily-armed Sunni insurgents appear gradually to
be forcing the Kurdish fighters back around Kobani, raising
fears that the town may fall. Either way, the tens of thousands
of refugees who have crossed the border in recent days may be in
Turkey for a long time, aid workers say.

'You've seen it in other places along the border. There's no
fighting anymore but people stay in Turkey,' said Umit Algan,
who runs the relief effort in the border town of Suruc for IMPR,
a Turkish aid organisation.

'I think it'll be the same here, they never know when
(Islamic State) might come back,' he said, adding that his
group's initial relief effort aimed to help refugees camping out
in mosques, schools and parks for a month only.

Crowds of mostly Syrian Kurds cheered from the Turkish
hillside as Kurdish shells kick up plumes of dust near Islamic
State positions just across the border, but the next day the
jihadists seized new ground
