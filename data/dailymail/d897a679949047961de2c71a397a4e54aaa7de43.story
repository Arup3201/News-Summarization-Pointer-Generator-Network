Jonjo Shelvey faces a four-match ban after he was charged with violent conduct by the FA for allegedly elbowing Emre Can in the face during Swansea City’s defeat at his old club Liverpool on Monday night.

However, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling will face no action over an apparent slap on Swansea defender Federico Fernandez later in the game because referee Andre Marriner said in his report on Tuesday that it was spotted by the match officials at the time.

Marriner confirmed that the incident involving Shelvey and Can went unseen, which has enabled the FA to act.

Shelvey has until 6pm on Wednesday to respond to the charge. He can either accept it and receive an automatic ban or ask for his case to be heard by a disciplinary commission at 7pm.

Either way, the 22-year-old will be suspended for four games if found guilty because he has already been sent off once before this season after picking up two yellow cards at Everton on his last return to Merseyside in November.

After the match, Shelvey's former Anfield team-mate Jamie Carragher criticised him afterwards, and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club's Melwood training ground when they were there.  

Shelvey took to Twitter to explain what happened and insisted he would not set out to hurt an opponent

'It's absolute madness,' said Carragher. 'You'd see this two or three times a week in training. He has bags of ability, Shelvey, but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too.' 

Shelvey, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million last year, had earlier pleaded his innocence on Twitter by saying that the elbow was unintentional and he had apologised to Can.

He wrote: ‘Just wanna say didn’t intentionally elbow emre can was just trying to get my arm across to get round him and it’s come off as I'm trying to hurt another play and I can assure you that, that isn’t the case. And I had apologised to emre can for catching him.’ 

Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth

Swansea boss Garry Monk also defended Shelvey, saying: ‘I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all. He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away.

‘I don’t think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed. No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn’t warrant any more action and the game went on.’

Carragher's fellow Sky TV pundit Gary Neville claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned Liverpool's Lazar Markovic a straight red card against Basle earlier this month.

'Garry Monk has already talked about the lack of discipline from Shelvey ahead of this game and this just proves it,' said Neville. 'When you first see it you can't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all. He swings into Can.

'The problem is the referee cannot put in his report that he hasn't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there. It's not as bad as the Papiss Cisse one (elbow on Everton's Seamus Coleman) but it is worse than the Markovic one we saw a few weeks ago.' 

'He has seen it (the Shelvey incident). There's no way he can't have not seen it. Andre Marriner can see it. 15 years ago you would have got a yellow card most, or maybe not even a yellow card, but he is a lucky boy because he throws the arm out.

'Andre Marriner needs to look at that freeze because he cannot say he has not seen that arm come out and hit him if he wants any credibility in the game.'
