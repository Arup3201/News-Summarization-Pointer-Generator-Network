Meet the young millionaire from Qatar who, at 26, has already owned a Bentley, a Ferrari and now drives a $270,000 Rolls Royce Ghost. 

Mohammed Al Kubaisi quickly built up a large fortune when his father handed over the reins to the family business - and like any young man with wealth, he indulged in his passion.

But he has also opened up the world of supercars to the masses by congregating dozens of the coveted luxury vehicles at events in capital Doha.

Usually locked away in the garages of the extremely wealthy or glimpsed roaring the streets of Doha - or Knightsbridge - Mr Al Kubaisi decided to feed his addiction to supercars by gathering together various models, including McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, in one place, for fans to admire.

He describes himself as 'a fan of supercars' and has owned an enviable fleet, including $235,000 Bentley Continental GT, a $221,000 (£140,000) Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and a Ferrari 458 Italia worth $240,000 (£160,000).

And his current ride is a powerful Rolls Royce Ghost - which comes with an eye-watering price tag of $270,000 (£175,000)/ 

Mr Al Kubaisi, who owns a small but successful real estate business which specialises in rentals for expats as well as a garage, said his events have been well received by Qatar's wealthy car enthusiasts.

From a wealthy Qatari family, he moved to Denver, Colorado, to study at the age of 18. Now, back in Qatar, he is single, and spends his time with friends, playing soccer or with his supercars. 

He says the first event, in 2012, featured around 30 models which were scouted from friends and contacts - and some were even featured after being spotted on the streets of Qatar. 

He said: 'Our first event in 2012 was during Ramadan and it went well. We gathered around 30 vehicles including supercars and European models,' said Mohammed.

'We got all the cars from friends and contacts, and also from spotting them on the streets.

'Our next event was held at Qatar Sports Club and was even bigger, we almost had too many cars, including McLarens, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Mercedes.'

A third event was staged in March last year - and attracted 50 extravagant supercars as well as numerous promoters and sponsors.

Mr Al Kubaisi adds he loves life in the fast lane - but his biggest problem is deciding which car he wants to drive.

'I had a Maserati Granturismo S - it was a nice car but I eventually sold it and bought an Aston Martin Rapide which I didn't think was very good,' he said.

'I sold that and bought my very first supercar, the Ferrari 599 GTB which was great but it wasn't quite powerful enough so I sold it and bought a (Mercedes-Benz) SLS 63 - but again I needed more power.

'So I waited around six months and bought the Ferrari 458 Italia - which is a great car.'
