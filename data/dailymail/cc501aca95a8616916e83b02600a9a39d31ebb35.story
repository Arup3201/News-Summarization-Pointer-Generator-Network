Jose Mourinho has returned from his family holiday in Greece ready to begin pre-season with Chelsea this week as he prepares for the new Premier League season.

The Blues boss will no doubt have had one eye on the World Cup as new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal masterminded Holland's penalty shootout win against Costa Rica to put the Dutch into the semi-finals.   

Van Gaal made the bold decision to bring on Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul in the closing stages of extra-time just to take part in the quarter-final shootout.

Krul managed to save two of the five penalties as Holland set up a semi-final against Argentina on Wednesday.

One of Mourinho key attributes is being able to change a game from the sidelines by making big decisions and will not think twice about hauling off a player before half-time if it means his team will benefit.

As Mourinho left the Mykonos Island airprot in Greece with his children and wife Matilde, his mind will no doubt have been racing with thought about how he is going to stop former Barcelona colleague Van Gaal in his new post.

The battle between the pair will surely become one of the most fascinating aspects of the new Premier League season as two hold friends lock horns.
