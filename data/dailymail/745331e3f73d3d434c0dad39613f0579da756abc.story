A pub has opened in Greater Manchester offering pints of beer for as little as £1.50 - but insists that it does not encourage irresponsible drinking.

The Pound Pub in Atherton, near Wigan, is the second location in a chain of new public houses offering no-frills booze at extremely low prices.

And - despite protests from some locals who prefer a pricier pint - the publican has insisted 'we don't encourage people to get drunk'.

Dave Sutton, 31, even says that the new budget drinking model could offer salvation for the British pub at a time when around 18 locals a week are closing across the country.

His pub has been open for around two weeks, and follows the first Pound Pub in Stockon-on-Tees which opened last month. Four types of booze - Fosters, Theakstons, Strongbow and John Smith's - are on offer there at £1 for half a pint or £1.50 for a whole.

The pub also offers bottles of Becks beer and fruit drink J2O for £1, and pints of Pepsi and R-Whites lemonade for the same price.

The location has an EasyJet-style logo and has the motto 'more round for your pound'.

Daytime: Drinking at the Pound Pub begins at 9am, which has prompted concerns from locals

Mr Sutton says the opening has riled other pub owners because it dominates daytime drinking in the area, but says he has seen 'no trouble'.

He said: 'At the end of the day, if you can only drink ten pints at £3, you are still only going to be able to drink that if they’re £1.50.

'We don’t encourage people to get drunk and there’s been no more trouble. In fact the pub is already going very well and the customers seem to be happy.

'The other pubs in the town are not so happy but that’s not our fault. That’s just because throughout the day we have the majority of customers in the town in here.

'Pubs around the country are shutting all the time so something has to be done - and this could be it.'

Mr Sutton said his clients are mainly old men drinking throughout the day, starting as early as 9am.

He said the the pub was only met with one objection when its application for an extension to its alcohol licence was put forward last year.

One daytime drinker said: 'People were expecting the street to be full of drunks but it’s not because even though the beer is cheap it’s still just passing trade.

'If people get out of hand they get kicked out - it’s like any other pub, only cheaper.'

Retired restaurant and factory worker Keith Emmott, 63, has been frequenting the pub in its various guises since 1963, when he says a pint was just 11 pence.

He added: 
'It’s always been a good pub and it still is, especially now it’s 
cheaper. They have a good landlord now who’s very caring because when I 
fall asleep he always wakes me up and that goes a long way.'

However,
 some residents of Atherton have criticsed the Pound Pub for taking 
advantage of 'vulnerable' drinkers and lowering the tone of the town.

Basic: The pub saves money by not offering entertainment or subscribing to Sky Sports

Busy: The pub's landlord says that trade has been strong since the pub opened

Salesman Adam Parkinson, 49, drinks in the nearby Last Orders Inn, for £3 a pint. He said: 'We don’t want the £1 pub around here. There are already enough pound shops and they’re rubbish too. All this bar is doing is selling cheap alcohol early in the morning to vulnerable people.

'It’s £3 a pint in here and I pay the extra because it’s civilised and not full of vulnerable people.'

Rival pub landlady Mary Bates, 44, who runs the nearby Jolly Nailor pub said she welcomed the pub for keeping 'bad people' out of her establishment.

She said: 'At least it keeps all the riff raff in one place. We are happy because it takes all the bad people out. Every town should have a pound pub because it attracts all the ne’er-do-wells.

'It used to be a cracking pub but it’s been going down and down.'

The local council has also raised fears that the pub will encourage 'irresponsible' problem drinking and threaten public health.

Wigan Council’s director of public health, Professor Kate Ardern, said: 'Alcohol used to be a luxury, but it is now widely available and often sold at pocket money prices. Research has proved that the cheaper alcohol is, the more people drink.

'Any promotion which potentially increases the supply of cheap alcohol and which appears to target those on limited incomes, especially young adults, who are cost-conscious, is highly irresponsible - particularly in a borough like Wigan which has high rates of alcohol harm.'

Hike: The average price of a pint of beer is £3.03, a five per cent increase since 2012
