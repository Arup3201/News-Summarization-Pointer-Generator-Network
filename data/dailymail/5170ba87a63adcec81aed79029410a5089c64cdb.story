This is the secret weapon which Hitler hoped would help destroy London during World War II.

Although 5,000 V1 rockets were launched by the Germans from France and Holland to bomb London, this is a rare Kamikaze-style version.

Because the aim of the rockets was so random - the 
bombs dropped when they ran out of fuel - 150 of them were modified with
 a small cockpit so they could be flown accurately into targets.

Dangerous: This is the secret weapon which Hitler hoped would help him to defeat the Allies in World War II

Lethal: This is a rare Kamikaze-style version of the V1 rocket which included a small cockpit so it could be flown accurately. It is pictured on display at the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum in Ashford, Kent

In a high-risk move, the pilot was meant
 to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a 
suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph.

None of the piloted rockets ever flew in
 anger, partly due to the lack of airmen willing to volunteer with the 
exception of a few Hitler fanatics.

This manned version of the fearsome flying missile, that was effectively a suicidal experiment by the Germans, has been owned by a British museum for over 40 years.

The piloted rocket was sent back to Germany to be restored by experts there to the condition it was in when it was found and seized by the Allies at the end of World War II.

Now complete after the £40,000 project, it is being returned by road to the museum in Kent.

Only six of them exist today, including 
the one that has undergone restoration. The other five are in museums in
 France, Holland, Canada, the US and Germany.

Rare: The piloted V1 rocket is pictured on display in Farnborough in 1945. Only 150 of them were made

Progress: The piloted V1 rocket receives some maintenance work at the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum in Kent

The V1 - or Fieseler Fi103R Reichenberg - is in full working condition, although it obviously does not contain one ton of explosives in the nose as it would have in the war.

The V1 rocket was the world’s first cruise missile causing massive loss of life.

The flying bomb was also known as the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug and was developed at Peenemünde Airfield by the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War.

They were designed for mass bombing of London and they were fired from launch sites along the French and Dutch coasts.

The very first V1 was fired at London on June 13, 1944. During their peak, more than 100 a day were lunched towards southeast England.

In order to try and stop the bombs from hitting targets, the British forces used guns and fighter aircraft to intercept the bombs. The launch sites and underground V1 storage depots were also targeted during strategic bombing.

In total, the bombs caused about 22,892 casualties, almost all of these were civilians.

Trevor Matthews, the founder of the Lashenden Museum near Maidstone, said: 'After 1945 the Fi103R initially made up part of an enemy aircraft exhibition at Farnborough.

'But because the British viewed the V1 as a munition and not an aircraft it was given to the army’s bomb disposal unit.

'We acquired it in 1970 from the army when our museum started up and we had itcosmetically restored then.

'But we have only been able to pull it out of a hanger when the weather has been okay to display it.'In 2000 we began a fundraising project to not only pay for its complete restoration but to also build a new display building for it.

'We found specialist restorers of wartime fighter planes based in Munich and the Fi103R was shipped over there four years ago.

'Since then they have restored it to how it was displayed at Farnborough in 1945.

'All
 the instruments in the cockpit were missing when we bought it but the 
specialists have sourced period instruments that are in working 
condition.

'It is now in full working order, although you would never get permission to fly it.'

The
 V1 and V2 flying rockets - or Hitler’s vengeance bombs as they were 
called - killed thousands of people and carried enough explosives to 
wipe out several buildings.

Restoration: The piloted V1 receives some maintenance work in 1970. It had recently been sent back to Germany to be restored by experts before heading back to the UK

Suicidal: In a high-risk move, the pilot was meant to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph

But due to their random nature, Hitler experimented with the idea of getting an airmen to steer them in the direction of a target.

Mr Matthews said: 'With a pilot you could aim it at a strategic target, like Buckingham Palace, until the last moment when they were meant to bail out.

'But it was totally kamikaze.

'The Germans dropped the idea in the end, largely because airmen realised it was a suicide mission.

'Also, at the time they were being tested the Allies were over-running their launch sites in France and then Holland.'

The rocket is 28ft long, has a wingspan of 22ft and is fitted with an Argus 109-014 pulse jet engine.The museum is due to take delivery of it later this week.

150 V1 rockets were fitted with cockpits so they could be steered into targets before pilots attempted to bail out

@highlight

But travelling at 550mph meant escape would almost be impossible and none were used in anger against the British people in World War Two

@highlight

Now a museum in Ashford, Kent has completed its restoration of a rare example - and although it will never be flown is considered airworthy
