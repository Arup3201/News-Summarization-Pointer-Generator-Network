This baby red deer appears to be in the middle of an identity crisis, as he has convinced himself he is a lamb and has joined a flock of sheep.

Shepherd Andrew Capell was shocked when he was counting his animals and noticed the male fawn had joined his 100 livestock on Dunwich Heath in Suffolk.

Mr Capell, who looks after the sheep which help maintain the National Trust land by grazing on it, said the lost deer became separated from its herd and attached itself to the flock.

Good friends: This baby red deer has lost his own herd so has joined a flock of sheep instead, and appears to be settling in well

One of the gang: The fawn (centre) has been widely welcomed by the rest of the flock, although his shepherd says he is towards the bottom of the pecking order

He has been living, eating and sleeping with his 100 new friends for about two weeks now and shows no sign of leaving.

The sheep do not seem to mind their new guest and have adopted him into the flock, giving him a warm welcome.

'I was counting the sheep when I spotted this little deer amongst the flock,' said Mr Capell.

'I think what's happened is that the main herd of deer have come through the field, jumped over the fence and then jumped out again and he's not gone with them.

'He seems to have adopted the flock and stayed with them and the flock have taken to him really well.

'There's a bit of a pecking order in the flock so he's finding his place within it. He sees to be the bottom of the ladder.

'He does seem to miss the sheep if he's too far away from them and does go looking for them.'

Cunfused: Shepherd Andrew Capell says that the deer seems convinced he is a lamb after a fortnight with them

Bonding: The deer has spent two weeks eating, drinking and sleeping with the 100 sheep is fully integrated

Sad: When the sheep move on to new pastures later this year, sadly the deer will be left behind

The National Trust had only recently moved the 100 sheep north from Orford Ness National Nature Reserve, where the fields become flooded with shallow water in the winter and so are too wet for the sheep to graze.

The deer now spends his day grazing with the sheep and does not seem to have noticed his lack of woolly coat or inability to bleat. He even sleeps in the field with the flock at night.

'I've never known of this happening before,' added Mr Capell.

'The big deer spend a lot of time in the field when the sheep are away in the summer and two winters ago we had a yearling in the field for two days but that did not hang around with the sheep.'

Surprise! 'I was counting the sheep when I spotted this little deer amongst the flock,' said shepherd Mr Capell

But sadly the young animal will not be able to stay a 'sheep deer' forever.

At the end of the winter the sheep will be taken back to their summer home, but the deer will have to stay behind on Dunwich Heath.

A spokesman for the National Trust added: 'It is hoped the young deer will rejoin his herd if they roam past the flock over the coming weeks.'
