This is the extraordinary moment a man kicked in a door, smashed panes of glass and sprayed two security guards with pepper spray in a violent attack at a McDonalds restaurant in Ireland.

Rafal Smolinski, 29, has been charged with criminal damage and public offences over the brazen attack at the fast food restaurant in Galway, which was captured by a witness on camera.

The footage, which at time of writing had more than 45,000 views on YouTube, shows a man furiously kicking in the glass of a door to the restaurant in the early hours of Friday, March 14.

Rafal Smolinkski launched a violent attack on a McDonalds in Galway, which was captured on camera

One of the security guards calls for help, as Smolinski managed to smash through the glass on the door

A male staff member holds the door shut while signalling for others to help him.

The man manages to kick the glass in, at which point he leans through the door frame and appears to yell: ‘So you want to f*** my mother?’

He then pulls out a can of pepper spray and sprays the staff member, who is seen later in the video wiping his eyes on his arm.

At this point customers start screaming and swearing in panic.

Another staff member attempts to stop Mr Smolinski, hitting him with a yellow cone, the type used to indicate that floors are wet.

Someone in the video can be heard yelling: 'He's got pepper spray!' as Smolinski leans inside the restaurant and sprays the security guard

A second security guard comes to the aid of his colleague, using a yellow cone as a weapon

The attacker flees temporarily, but then returns, launching another pepper spray attack while yelling ‘You want to f*** my mother? You f***ing bastard!’

He is then pulled away by his friends onto the street, though he returns to pull down his pants and moon the diners.

In a lighthearted moment, a customer can be heard asking in the video: 'Can I have a cheeseburger?', showing witnesses were not too traumatised by the event.

Police were called to the scene. Mr Smolinski was arrested shortly after the incident.

The security guards were taken to nearby Galway University Hospital but were later discharged.

Smolinski resorted to pepper spray again to ward off the second security guard

Both of the security guards were hit with pepper spray during the attack and were taken to hospital after the incident, though they were later discharged

Mr Smolinski appeared in Galway district court on March 15. He is due to appear again before the court on March 22.

It is unknown what prompted the attack.
