Raids on release: Joseph Williams targeted a number of bookies to feed his gambling habit

A convicted hammer killer carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers while he was on day release from prison. 

Joseph Williams was allowed temporary leave from his ‘open’ prison in preparation for permanent release from his life sentence for murder.

But the 52-year-old gambling addict took advantage of lax supervision to go on a robbery spree to pay for his habit.

Yesterday at the Old Bailey he was jailed indefinitely as the court heard he posed a ‘significant risk’ to the public.

The case raises questions over why he was let out and the failure of supervision while he was at large.  

Prison officials said all inmates on temporary release have to ‘meet strict criteria and pass a rigorous risk assessment’.

Williams was caught entirely by chance when he shunted an unmarked police car and a sharp-eyed officer recognised his face from a wanted poster.

Back bench Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This shows that there is something badly wrong with our criminal justice system. If people are going to have confidence in that system we need to hold to account the probation service, the courts and prosecutors.’

Williams, of Bolton, was jailed for life in 1996 for battering to death sociology lecturer Ayodele Odamttun with a claw hammer while high on crack cocaine.

On leave: Williams was granted day release from HMP Blantyre House to work as a lorry driver

Williams was jailed for life in 1996 
for battering Mr Odamttun to death with a claw hammer in the victim's 
flat in Battersea, South-West London.

He was high on crack cocaine when he inflicted at least 24 blows to his head as well as multiple stab wounds, on July 27 1995.

Williams, then 36 and from Bolton, 
Lancashire, confessed to the murder to a friend as they watched gangster
movie 'Carlito's Way', telling him: 'I just weighed somebody in.'

At the time Judge Alexander Hutchinson QC described it as 'a brutal murder' resulting from an 'explosion of violence'.

He was sentenced to a minimum 12 years, later increased to 13 years, and had become eligible for released on licence.

He rained at least 24 blows on his 45-year-old victim’s head and inflicted multiple stab wounds.

He confessed to the murder as he watched gangster movie Carlito’s Way with a friend, telling him: ‘I just weighed somebody in.’

At the time Judge Alexander 
Hutchinson QC said the attack involved an ‘explosion of violence’ and 
sentenced Williams to at least 12 years – a term later increased to 13 
years.

As he came to the end of his 
sentence, Williams was allowed day release from HMP Blantyre House in 
Kent. He took up a driving job with an insulation firm in  Croydon, 
South London, as the parole board considered letting him out 
permanently.

But the  court heard Williams blew his wages on gambling and turned to robbery to fund his betting addiction.

Armed with a spanner and paint brush 
taped together and wrapped in a carrier bag to look like a gun, he 
carried out his first robbery at Paddy Power in Wallington, South 
London, on February 24 last year, stealing £300.

Within six months he had committed 11 
robberies or attempted robberies at bookmakers in the area – including 
three more at the same branch of Paddy Power – netting him £3,300.

Prosecutor Kate Lumsdon said: ‘He was 
acting alone, he wore a black hooded coat or jumper with a scarf across 
his face, or sometimes a balaclava. He carried a plastic bag which 
appeared to have  something in it, and the way he held it was as if it 
was a gun. This “gun” was used to threaten staff in order to get them to
hand over the money.’

Williams was caught when he drove into
the back of an unmarked police car. The driver, Detective Constable 
Peter Jelly, then spotted his face on a Flying Squad wanted poster.

After the accident Williams apologised to the officer and laughed, adding: ‘I am on day release from Blantyre House.’ 

Williams was later picked out on CCTV 
from one of the betting shops, and his DNA was found on gloves dropped 
as he fled from William Hill in Hackbridge, South London.

After a week-long trial at the Old 
Bailey last month, Williams was convicted of eight robberies, three 
attempted robberies and nine counts of possessing an imitation firearm.

Yesterday, the judge, Recorder Joanna 
Greenberg QC, ordered he serve an indeterminate sentence for public 
protection with a minimum term of six years.

A probation officer who assessed him 
said he had ‘the capacity to cause very serious harm through extreme 
levels of violence’ and identified him as ‘high risk’.

Tory MP for Croydon Gavin Barwell 
said: ‘This story shows that when people are put in prison we need to do
a better job addressing the problems that lead them to commit crime.

‘And until we are sure they have done that, we shouldn’t release them early.’

The Prison Service said: ‘Cases like 
these are extremely rare. The overwhelming majority of releases pass 
without any problems and help to resettle prisoners back into the 
community.’
