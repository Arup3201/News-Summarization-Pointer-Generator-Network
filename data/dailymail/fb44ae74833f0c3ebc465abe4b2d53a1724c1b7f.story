A couple who spent a decade trying for a baby and endured seven stillbirths and miscarriages have finally had a healthy baby girl.

Last year Sara Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch and baby Mabel was born in April. Despite being born three months prematurely, she has now been able to go home.

Mrs Sills, 39, from Skellgate, North 
Yorkshire, said: ‘My husband Chris and I call Mabel our "rainbow baby” because after riding a
hard storm, there is always a rainbow, so she is definitely a miracle 
and she means the world to us all.’

Sara and Chris Sills, both 39, went through seven miscarriages and stillbirths over a period of ten years before Mabel was born in April this year

Over the past ten years, Mrs Sills tried time and again to successfully carry a baby, but faced the agony of losing each of her seven babies - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda.

Each of these pregnancies only survived up to 24 weeks so the couple faced a desperate wait to see if Mabel would survive.

Mrs Sills, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘I didn't know anything about stillbirths and miscarriages until we went through it.

‘I would be fine and then sometimes I would have bleeds and sudden pains and my waters would just go.

‘I would then be in labour for weeks where I was prone to infection, and it proved too much for all of the babies.

After her seventh miscarriage, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch which strengthened her cervix enough to enable her to carry Mabel

Mabel was born three months prematurely weighing just 1lb 6oz and spent the first two months of her life in hospital

‘Nothing can prepare you for a stillbirth. It's the silence that is the worst part.

‘Knowing you have been through a pregnancy, means you expect to have a baby at the end of it. You can't explain how hard it is.

‘Watching Chris was the hardest part because there was nothing he could do.’

Mr and Mrs Sills were already parents to Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10, but felt they should keep trying for a fourth baby.

‘We always wanted a big family. We wanted four children and so we thought it was something we were meant to do so kept trying,’ said Mrs Sills.

Mr and Mrs Sills say that they call Mabel their 'rainbow baby' because 'after riding a hard storm, there is always a rainbow'

When Mrs Sills was carrying Mabel she was put on bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital in an attempt to stop her waters breaking too early but she still went into labour when only 25 weeks pregnant

‘At first we decided not to try again but then we just couldn't. Some people think it's strange that we kept trying but if we hadn't we wouldn't have Mabel here today.’

Despite having a normal birth with Stefan, both Katie and Lily were born prematurely but went on to become healthy children.

After
the series of miscarriages, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch, a procedure known as a tracheloplasty, which helps to strengthen the cervix and helps prevent 
premature labour.

She 
said: ‘I was put on pure bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital and 
spent most of my pregnancy there in the hope it would stop my waters 
breaking.

‘I went into labour with Mabel at 25 
weeks but I managed to hold on to her for another two weeks and she was 
born by caesarean section.

The couple, who also have three older children - Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10 - were desperate to have a fourth baby because they had always wanted to have a big family

They say they will always remember the seven children they lost - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda. Mabel is pictured with her sisters, Lily, 10, (left) and Katie, 13, (right)

‘Mabel was delivered in a sack of fluid which was popped when she was born to make the birth less traumatic.’

She was born in April, weighing 1lb 6oz, however the family's fight was not over yet.

Mr Sills, 39, a training consultant, said: ‘We spent weeks by her bedside, praying that she was going to survive.

‘The
fact that she had been born alive was a step forward for us and we 
weren't prepared to let her go after all we had been through.

‘We
watched parents taking their babies home every day and we just dreamed 
of the day we could take Mabel home. I think we always worried it would 
never come.’

Now back at home, the family say they will never forget the seven members they lost.

Mr and Mrs Sills say that on each of the stillborn children's birthdays they will light a candle to remember them

Mrs Sills said: ‘We will always remember our other children. We are always talking about them - it's healthy for the children.

‘We have special boxes and teddies that we have bought for each of them and on their birthdays we will light a candle to remember them by.

‘We buy them all cards and balloons which we let off into the sky as a way of reaching out to them, and at Christmas we put their decorations on the tree to remember them by.

‘A baby is still a baby, which I carried and won't forget just because they're not with us today.

‘We would not wish anyone to have to go through what we have been through, but we are pleased we kept trying.

‘She's a little miracle and we will never take forget how lucky we are.’
