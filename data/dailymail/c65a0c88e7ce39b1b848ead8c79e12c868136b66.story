Can 'withstand even the most aggressive attempts on your valuables'

Whether lounging by the pool on a sunbed or lazing at the beach on a deckchair, holidaymakers need to ensure their valuables are kept safe.

A portable lock-box and safe is hoping to provide the answer, giving travellers a place to stash smartphones, wallets, jewellery, keys and cash.

At just 6.5ins high and 9ins long, the AquaVault is made from white durable plastic - 'to withstand even the most aggressive attempts on your valuables'.

Durable design: The device - on sale for £27 - can withstand 'aggressive attempts on your valuables'

The waterproof box, on sale for £27, fits on to 95 per cent of beach furniture, clipping around the back of the arms of the object, and bolting into place with a lock and a code.

Holidaymakers can use it around pushchairs, golf carts, a bike or even a rope while at a hotel, on a cruise ship or at a theme park to store their personal items.

The AquaVault is already available to rent at high-end resorts in Florida and California.

On its website, AquaVault claims: 'AquaVault​ is a unique, patented product with international patents pending that was created with the vision to revolutionize the level of safety and comfort you want to experience while you enjoy your time outdoors. 

And relax... The device claims to allow holidaymakers to store their valuables on the beach

Safe keeping: The AquaVault can store cash, wallets, smartphones, jewellery and cash

'We designed a stylish lock box that easily and quickly attaches to virtually all beach furniture without costly permanent additions.

'AquaVault is both a visual and functional deterrent to any would-be beach thief. 

'This allows you to enjoy the sun and the surf with peace of mind. Plus, AquaVault is compact and easy to store.  Pack it with your vacation items, or put it in your beach bag for your next excursion.'

It adds: 'The AquaVault is made of durable high impact ABS thermoplastic to withstand even the most aggressive attempts on your valuables and its anti-corrosion components prevent rusting.

Handy gadget: Where to store your valuables on the beach is an age-old problem

'The 120-square-inch cargo hull is roomy enough for wallets, watches, mobile phones, jewelry, keys and other valuables.

'And the best part? It is designed to fit over 95% of existing beach furniture.  Once your valuables are secure, you can start enjoying yourself without worry!'

It comes as a prototype for another beach safety device was launched. Marcal DaCunha's Beach Vault, which is expected to retail for £18, is closed by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside, and then covered by a towel and pillowcase.

Whenever a sun-seeker is lying on the towel to relax, the 12ins-deep and 6ins-wide container is completely concealed.

Hidden treasure: Laying on the towel over the beach vault means you can rest-assured your valuables will be safe

Passing thieves would then have no opportunity to steal any of the valuables if a user fell asleep because they would be on top of the locker.

The Beach Vault comes with a special towel that has a hole cut away for easy access, which is covered by an attached, inflatable pillow.

The idea is you then place the towel over the top of it, which has a hole in it so you can access the container, but covered by a built-in pillow.

'This means that when you are lying down you are directly on top of your stuff and you don't have to worry about someone taking anything,' the creator says. 

Practical: Your valuables will be safe hidden under your towel in the Beach Vault

Safety first: Items such as mobile phones and tablets can be hidden away when you go for a quick doze

Secure: The Beach Vault is closed by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside

'If you were to leave your stuff unattended the Beach Vault would remain completely out of sight.

'There is nothing to stop a thief from picking the whole thing up and leaving if they knew where it was, but this is the same risk as using a handbag.'

Marcal is raising money on a crowdfunding website to go towards the manufacturing of the Beach Vault.
