Ashley Cole proved he is still a Blue at heart by spending Monday night watching his former side Chelsea cruise to a 3-1 win over Burnley on his laptop.

Cole, who joined Roma on a free transfer after leaving Stamford Bridge at the end of last season, cheered on his ex-team-mates from thousands of miles away.

He tweeted the screen of his laptop and included a blue heart, indicating his feelings for the club, and several smiley faces as he watched the victory.

After the match, Cole posted his congratulations to his former side before revealing he was off to bed ahead of Roma's final pre-season match against Fenerbahce.

The former England full back would have been pleased with what he saw as Chelsea looked impressive throughout their opener at Turf Moor.

Burnley took the lead through Scott Arfield, however their lead lasted just three minutes as Chelsea new boy Diego Costa levelled the scoring on his Premier League debut.

Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic also netted in the first half to hand the west London outfit all three points.
