Not a single tackle was made but tensions were already heating up between both teams ahead of the junior rugby league Test.

While eyes were rolling and tongues flicking, players from the Junior Kangaroos and Junior Kiwis were clashing heads during the pre-match haka before match officials stepped in on Saturday night.

The video shows the players  standing just centimetres from each other as the Kiwis got up close to the Kangaroos before the pushing and shoving broke out at the Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland.

Referees stepped in to separate the two teams before things escalated in Auckland on Saturday night

Both teams were standing toe to toe while the young Australian players linked arms during the performance.

‘That was interesting viewing for sure,’ Junior Kiwis coach Brent Gemmell told NZ Herald. 

‘When I saw Australia advance and they crossed halfway and I knew our boys were still to walk forward and still to stick a hand out at them.

‘I thought this could potentially turn really sour but it calmed down and we got on with the footy which was good.’

New Zealand beat Australia 15-14 with a field goal in the last minute of the game.
