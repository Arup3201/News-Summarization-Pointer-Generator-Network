Imagine a miniature robo-surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach.

Once inside, the robot can expertly manoeuvre its way around the abdominal cavity, which has been filled with gas to make more room for work. 

It can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer.

This is the scenario being explored by 
Nasa in the hope that risky surgical operations in space will someday 
become a routine matter.

Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor.

The robot is due to have its first zero-gravity test in the coming months to prove its dexterity and ability to manipulate objects, according to a report New Scientist.

The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera.

Would you trust a robot with surgical tools? Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor

The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera.

The camera feed is sent to a control station, where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks.

The
 robot would be remote-controlled, although controlling it from as far 
away as Earth would mean impracticable delays in communication.

Instead, the plan is to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other.

'While this work is in an early phase, the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or Mars colony,' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype.

Instead, Nasa plans to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other.

Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station who face medical emergencies can be sent back to Earth in an escape capsule within a matter of hours.

But for longer missions, such to Mars, coming home quickly won’t be possible.  

So far, tests using the prototype have performed on pigs. The next step, said Nasa, is to work in human cadavers.

A recent study of 12 astronauts show the heart becomes more spherical when exposed to long periods of microgravity in space.

The change could lead to significant cardiac problems, according to research to be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 63rd Annual Scientific Session.

With implications for an eventual manned mission to Mars, the findings represent an important step toward understanding how a spaceflight of 18 months or more could affect astronauts’ heart health.

'The heart doesn’t work as hard in space, which can cause a loss of muscle mass,' said James Thomas, managing director of, Moore Chair of Cardiovascular Imaging and Lead Scientist for Ultrasound at Nasa.

'That can have serious consequences after the return to Earth, so we’re looking into whether there are measures that can be taken to prevent or counteract that loss.'

Nasa said exercise regimens developed for astronauts could also be used to help maintain heart health in people on Earth who have severe physical limitations.
