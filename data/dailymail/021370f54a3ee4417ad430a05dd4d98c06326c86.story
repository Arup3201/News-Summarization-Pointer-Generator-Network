Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger remains confident his side can reach boiling point over the next 10 games and force their way back into the  Premier League title race.

The Gunners head to Sunderland on Saturday in seventh place after five draws have left them eleven points behind leaders Chelsea, who are away to Manchester United on Sunday.

Only a dramatic late recovery, with two goals in the final two minutes, secured victory in the Champions League at Anderlecht on Wednesday night.

The French manager believes his side will hit top form in the coming weeks after a slow start to the season 

Wenger accepts his side need to add an efficiency to their game at both ends of the pitch, but feels it will all come together over the next few weeks.

'The main thing is there, the attitude and the quality, but water boils at 100 Degrees and not at 99, so we have to add that degree,' said Wenger.

'I look at how we can be more efficient, that is my only worry.

'We dominate our games. It is just that when we have a weaker moment we pay for it, which is why we have to produce more effort defensively as a team.

'If we are more efficient in 10 games time then we will be in a much better position, so let's start on Saturday (at Sunderland).'

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is set to return having served a one-match European ban in midweek.

Wenger feels the 24-year-old has continued his improvement but warns the Pole faces a 'big fight' to stay number one ahead of Colombian David Ospina, who is currently sidelined by injury, and Emiliano Martinez, the 22-year-old Argentinian who did not look out of place when standing in against Anderlecht.

The Gunners were poor against Anderlecht but won the game with a 90th minute winner from Lukas Podolski

'One of the problems he had recently (was coming out of his goal), but I don't think it is a deep problem,' Wenger said of Szczesny.

'I want him to come out, I encourage him to come out, but overall he is doing well and is improving always.

'Wojciech is (an) important (player), but he is in a big fight with Ospina and Martinez, I think that will keep him on his toes.

'At the moment I think he is doing alright, but he is in a big fight.'

Arsenal will be looking to put a few more goals past their former keeper Vito Mannone, who shipped eight at Southampton last weekend.

The Italian, who left last summer, wants the Sunderland players to repay the ticket and travel expenses of their 2,500 fans who made the 653-mile round trip from Wearside.

It is a gesture which comes as no surprise to Wenger.

'Vito is from a normal background like we all are. His gesture was spontaneous and not calculated because it was quite an expensive one, so I think he shows that he cares,' said the Arsenal manager.

'He did well (here), but was in the position of Martinez, a number three.

'Mannone had the quality, but didn't play the games and after a certain age you have to let them go.

'So he went to Sunderland, where he was not first choice at the start, but he gained his place and I was not surprised because he is quick, confident and overall he has done extremely well there.'
