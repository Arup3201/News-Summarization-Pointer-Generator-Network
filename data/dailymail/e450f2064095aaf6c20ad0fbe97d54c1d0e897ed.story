Dame Angela Watkinson has received two tickets to the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in London every year since 2011 from JTI

A Tory MP who tried to stop the introduction of plain cigarette packets has received £5,000 in Chelsea Flower Show tickets from a leading tobacco firm, it has emerged.

Dame Angela Watkinson has received two tickets to the Royal Horticultural Society show every year since 2011, at a total cost of £4,984.

Earlier this week, the Tory MP said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life-long non-smoker.

Speaking at the House of Commons' debate over plans to strip tobacco packaging of branding, the 73-year-old said: 'There can't be anyone in this country, young or old, who does not know about the health risks of tobacco.

'Nobody smokes in ignorance.'

The MP for Hornchurch and Upminster received tickets to the London flower show from tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Camel cigarettes.

Deborah Arnott, of Action on Smoking and Health, said Dame Angela was probably 'well worth' her invitation to the London horticultural event.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I am sure the tobacco industry thought Dame Angela was well worth a free invitation since she was the only MP prepared to stand up in the House of Commons to argue against standardised packaging.'

Dame Angela's office said that other MPs had also accepted tickets to the flower show and said she had made her interests on the tobacco matter 'quite clear' in debates.

Last July, the MailOnline revealed how a total of nine Tory MPs had accepted free tickets to the horticultural show, and opera performances, from JTI.

The Commons register of members’ interests revealed that seven Conservative MPs and one Labour MP accepted tickets for two to the Chelsea Flower Show from JTI in May 2013.

The Tories include Dame Angela, were Nigel Adams, Oliver Colville, Edward Garnier, Mark Pritchard, Laurence Robertson, Alec Shelbrooke, while the Labour MP was Lindsay Hoyle.

The Government has announced plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes that includes grisly warnings about the dangers of smoking. However, Dame Angela has said she will vote against plain packets

At the time. the MPs gave differing figures for the supposed value of the tickets, varying from £1,133 to £1,260. Mr Adams received Chelsea tickets on two successive days – May 22 and 23 – costing £1,188 and £1,050 plus VAT.

A further four MPs – two Conservative and two Labour – took tickets for last year's Glyndebourne opera festival at a country house in West Sussex.

These were Christopher Chope and Bob Walter, both Tories; and Jim Dowd and Gerald Kaufman, both Labour. The listed value for the tickets for two to see the opera Ariadne on Naxos vary from £1,278 to £1,534.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was also treated to more than £1,000 worth of hospitality at the Chelsea Flower Show by JTI in 2011, it was revealed.

He has also warned there are concerns over the plans to remove branding from tobacco products, suggesting it could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue.

JTI tried and failed to overturn a ban on the display of tobacco in shops introduced by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley.

All gifts accepted by the MPs were declared and allowed under parliamentary rules.

It comes after Mr Hammond opened up a Cabinet split in the House of Commons on Wednesday by questioning government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes.

He said there were concerns the scheme could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue.

His comments came a day after David Cameron finally threw his weight behind laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings.

MPs will have a free vote on the plans before the election but are expected to back them, with the law expected to come into force next year. 

But Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 5 Live the issue was complex, and he would look 'very carefully' at the evidence before deciding how to vote.

'It's a complex issue because experiments have happened around the world,' he said. 'It's very important to look at the evidence of those experiments and see what the evidence shows.

'Also some concerns have been expressed about whether it's going to make the counterfeiting of cigarettes easier and increasing trade, which deprives us of a lot of revenue.'

A packet of 20 cigarettes costs £8.47 on average, of which £6.49 is tax.

Medical experts say non-smokers, and younger children in particular, are likely to find plain packaging less appealing.

But right-wing Tory backbenchers see it as a 'nanny state' measure, and others are concerned it would lead to job losses.

One law firm said plain cigarette packaging could be the thin end of the wedge, with alcohol, chocolate and fizzy drinks targeted next.

Tom Scourfield, head of intellectual property at CMS, said: 'This is a first foray into depriving proprietary rights to perfectly legal products to discourage their consumption.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the plan was ineffectual and 'counter to freedom, the basic building block of prosperity'.

Liberal Democrat communities minister Stephen Williams admitted there was division within the Government over plain packaging.

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Dame Angela and Mr Hammond for further comment.
