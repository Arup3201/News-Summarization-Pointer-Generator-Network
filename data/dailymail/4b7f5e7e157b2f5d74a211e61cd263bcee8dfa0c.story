A 100-year-old Rolls-Royce built for an Indian prince is going under the hammer - and is set to fetch £400,000.

The Silver Phantom is customised to include a colourful umbrella, reminiscent of flashy Penelope Pitstop from classic cartoon Wacky Races.

The unusual addition was ordered by Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore, to shield his servants from the sun.

Luxury Rolls-Royces were popular among Indian rulers because their sturdy construction equipped them to negotiate the tricky terrain.

The maharaja who ordered this model in 1911 called it 'Victoria'. He was one of the world's wealthiest men, being worth the equivalent of £35billion at his death in 1940.

He was so keen on Rolls-Royces that he used to order them in batches of seven. Within the company, 'doing a Mysore' became a shorthand for placing bulk orders.

Krishna IV was the 24th ruler from the Wodeyar dynasty, which ruled Mysore in south-west India from 1399 to the country's unification in 1947. He was called 'Rajarshi' - 'Saintly King' - by Mahatma Gandhi.

His Silver Ghost 40/50hp Six Cylinder 
car is being sold by a private collector, and will be auctioned by 
Bonhams at the Goodwood Revival meeting on September 16.

A spokesman from the auction house said: 'The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was the origin of the company's claim of manufacturing the "best car in the world".

'Rolls-Royce began building their 40/50hp Six Cylinder model in 1907, and it quickly became known as the "Silver Ghost". This was a reference to the company's own silver-painted trials car, which earned the name for its pace and silence in operation.

'Such was the evolution of the model, with improved technical details each year and often many times within the year, that it has long been the desire of car collectors to acquire what they consider to be a "full set" of pre-war Silver Ghosts, one from each production year.'

A second Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, dating from 1908, is also being sold at the same time. It is one of only four surviving examples from that year and was restored in the 1990s.
