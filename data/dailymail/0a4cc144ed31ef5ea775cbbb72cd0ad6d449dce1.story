For most of us, the only recycling this Christmas involved large piles of wrapping paper.

But the BBC took things to a whole new level by re-using many of its biggest Christmas shows days – and in some cases, hours – after they first aired.

Viewers were shocked to see shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Gruffalo’s Child, which aired on Christmas Day, reappear on BBC1 on Boxing Day.

The festive episode of Doctor Who was not far behind as viewers were hit with it for a second time, just two days after it premiered on December 25.

The Christmas Eve episode of Winter Wipeout was on again on Boxing Day and another hotly anticipated Christmas Day show, Absolutely Fabulous, will be screened tonight.

Even one of the biggest films was being given a second outing – The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe, which aired on BBC1 on Christmas Eve, is on BBC3 tomorrow night.

Was this the worst Christmas ever on the BBC?

ITV gave shows such as Michael Buble: Home For Christmas and The Jonathan Ross Show more than one showing, and the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey will be screened again on New Year’s Day.

But viewers singled out the BBC for recycling so much of their new output over the festive period.

As well as its big  Christmas Day shows, the corporation also aired cookery shows The Hairy Bikers’ Christmas Party, Rick Stein’s Spanish Christmas and Lorraine’s Last Minute Christmas only 15 hours after their first slot.

Viewers have also complained that this year’s festive line-up was one of the worst in recent memory.

Shows such as the return of Absolutely Fabulous  did not live up to many people’s expectations and the new Sir David Jason comedy was another disappointment.

As well, the Downton Abbey special on Christmas Day did not get the huge ratings many were expecting.

One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message board: ‘What’s with all the repeats? On Boxing Day you repeated Strictly from Christmas Day, Winter Wipeout from Christmas Eve, not to  mention the numerous repeats of the Morecambe and Wise Specials.

‘There is no need to repeat programmes now as  most people have access to a digital recorder… can’t you spend the licence fee on some new programmes instead.’

A BBC spokesman  said: ‘We never repeat prime-time shows in the same slot.

‘This Christmas has seen brand new shows in  drama, factual, entertainment and religion.

‘Over 91 per cent of programming on peak-time on BBC1 is brand new and has never been shown before.’
