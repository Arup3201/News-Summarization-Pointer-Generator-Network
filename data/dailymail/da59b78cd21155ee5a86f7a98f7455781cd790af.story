Boston is 'wicked excited' to be the U.S. selection for the 2024 Olympics bid, city officials said today.

The Massachusetts capital beat tough competition from San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington to be the United States Olympic Committee's choice for the American bid on Thursday.

'I'm wicked excited, Boston is wicked excited,' Bid Chair John Fish said as he dipped into local dialect while responding to the result with other city officials on Friday.

Mayor Marty Walsh, who also addressed the media alongside Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, added: 'Wow, can you believe this?'

Assurances: Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he intended for the bid to be the most transparent in Olympic history so that skeptics would be assured funds were not being mishandled

He announced meetings would soon be held with residents to discuss the plans, vowing to make the process transparent and attempting to reassure those who fear public money will be misspent.

'I promise this will be the most open, inclusive and transparent process in Olympic history,' he said.

Boston joins Rome and an as yet undecided German city in the race to host the 2024 Games.

The International Olympic Committee's deadline for bid submissions is September 15 and the host city will be chosen in 2017. 

The U.S. has not held an Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. New York failed in a bid for the 2012 Games and Chicago failed in 2016. 

After Boston won the nomination, United States Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst said: 'We're excited about our plans to submit a bid for the 2024 Games and feel we have an incredibly strong partner in Boston that will work with us to present a compelling bid.

'We're grateful to the leaders in each of the four cities for their partnership and interest in hosting the most exciting sports competition on earth. 

'The deliberative and collaborative process that we put in place for selecting a city has resulted in a strong U.S. bid that can truly serve the athletes and the Olympic and Paralympic movements.'

The team has not yet released plans for the stadiums and event spaces, but have previously said they will rely heavily upon structures that already exist in the city, including the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, university arena, and the city's park system.

America last hosted the Olympic Games in 1996 when the prestigious competition was held in Atlanta 

Plans also include a temporary Olympic stadium in South Boston, which would be dismantled at the close of the Games.

Last year, organizers said the venues required to host the Games would cost approximately $4.5 billion in private funding as well as $5 billion in regional infrastructure improvements.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh previously said: 'It is an exceptional honor for Boston to be chosen as the U.S. representative in the running for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

'This selection is in recognition of our city's talent, diversity and global leadership.

'Our goal is to host Olympic and Paralympic Games that are innovative, walkable and hospitable to all. Boston hopes to welcome the world's greatest athletes to one of the world's great cities.' 

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Back said: 'The Boston bid will be a strong one.

Bostonians are well known for their enthusiasm for sport and the city has a great heritage in sport, science and education.'

Boston will have to beat off competition from the likes of Italy, Germany and France

Boston hopes the fact that most of the venues will be within walking distance of the city center will improve the chances of their bid.

So far, only Rome is the only other city to publicly announce its intention to bid for the games. Germany is expected to chose either Berlin or Hamburg, while Istanbul, Paris, Doha and an African city are also thought to be considering bids. 

Former Massachusetts governor and failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney has backed the Boston bid. He was part of the team that brought the 2002 winter games to Salt Lake City. 

Mr Romney said: 'We know Boston is the place to inspire a new generation of athletes to discover the greatness within.'

The USOC considered 35 cities over a 22-month evaluation process before deciding upon Boston.
