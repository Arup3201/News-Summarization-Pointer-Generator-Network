Former world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko was caught up in violent protests in Ukraine on Sunday.

The opposition leader attempted to stop the dissenters fighting with police but came under attack himself during the riots in Ukraine's capital city.

Klitschko, who was hosed down with a fire extinguisher, said: '[President] Yanukovich and his henchmen want to steal our country.

'Ukraine is united as never before in its struggle against those in power today, in its determination not to allow a dictatorship.'

Klitschko, who is leader of pro-European party UDAR, recently vacated his WBC title to focus on his campaign ahead of the presidential elections next year.

The belt will be contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne.

A group of radical activists began attacking riot police with sticks, 
trying to push their way toward the Ukrainian parliament building, which
 has been cordoned off by rows of police and buses.

The protesters, many wearing hard hats and gas masks, used stun grenades and fire extinguishers and threw flares as they attacked police in riot gear.

Numerous explosions were heard and plumes of smoke rose above the crowd. Activists chanted 'Shame!' and 'Revolution.' Some were injured and medics were seen treating them

The clashes occurred shortly after a large peaceful rally on Kiev's main square, part of the anti-government protests rocking Ukraine since President Viktor Yanukovich's decision to freeze ties with the European Union and embrace Russia instead.

Since then, Moscow has promised a $15billion dollar (Â£9bn) bailout loan to aid Ukraine's struggling economy.

Scores of opposition leaders and journalists have been attacked, harassed and prosecuted since the protests started on November 21.

Last week, Mr Yanukovich caused uproar at home and abroad when he approved a number of laws that limit Ukrainians' rights to protest, civic activism and free speech. The US called that legislation 'undemocratic'.

The laws prohibit demonstrators from wearing masks or hard hats at rallies, prompting many to don theatrical masks and kitchen pots at Sunday's rally. Several opposition leaders addressed the crowds from a giant stage, wearing bright construction workers' hats.

Other provisions of the controversial legislation restrict the activity of non-governmental groups funded by the West and seek to equate critical reporting with defamation.

Opposition leaders denounced Mr Yanukovich's legislation as unconstitutional and called for formation of parallel governing structures in the country.

'The power in Ukraine belongs to the people,' said Arseniy Yatseniuk, one of the several protest leaders.

Mr Yanukovich's government has ignored previous demands of the opposition.
