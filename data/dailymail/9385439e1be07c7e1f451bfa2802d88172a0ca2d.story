At the end of a working week, sitting up to watch a long film or reading a novel can see like too much effort.

But now there are glasses that allow apathetic telly addicts and lethargic book worms to kick back and watch their favorite shows lying down.

While the idea is a not a new one, the £10 'Lazyglasses' allow wearers to lie flat on their back without having to strain their neck to see a screen or page in front of them.

They work a little like a periscope, using mirrors to bounce light from one place to another to allow a wearer to effectively see in an unnatural direction.

The light bounces from a mirror placed at 45 degrees in the main body of the glasses and then out to a person's eye.

Retailer ThinkGeek describes the Lazyglasses as having 'special mirrored lenses' but also says that the spectacles can be worn over prescription glasses.

The website noted that lying flat on your back, as comfortable as it can be, is not at all conducive to watching TV or reading as people have to hold the book in front of them, or strain their necks to see the TV, expending precious energy.

Talking about watching a film or playing a game on a computer, It said: 'Your screen, sitting upright, is 
minus-90 degrees from your field of view.

'Sure, you can roll on your 
side, but you'd have to roll your screen, keyboard, and mouse over on 
its side, too. That won't work.'

Commenting on the glasses sold on the website, one prospective buyer said: 'I am not sure whether this is brilliant or preposterous...both?' while another wrote: 'there is a fine line between genius and insanity'.

Before every household had a television, so-called Hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 and never took off.

They were designed to make it easier for people to read in bed.

The words from the page were beamed to the reader's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and not have to strain their neck.
