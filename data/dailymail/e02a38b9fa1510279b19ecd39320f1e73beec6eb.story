Medium: Karl Lang is accused of persuading the woman to strip naked during a séance as it would increase her spiritual powers

A self-styled psychic who persuaded women to strip to enhance their chances of contacting the dead told a client to perform ‘like a porn star’, a court has heard.

Karl Lang is said to have ‘brainwashed’ two victims into believing being naked would increase their spiritual abilities.

One of them, aged 26, told a court she felt ‘embarrassed and ashamed’ that she was fooled into taking part in nude séances.

Giving evidence by live video link to avoid seeing 49-year-old Lang in the dock, she said she had been desperate to make contact with her grandfather. Describing Lang’s alleged method of improving her spiritual power, she said: ‘To get stronger, he told me I had to do things that mankind was afraid of.

‘This meant I had to get naked and perform a bit like a porn star. He said the more outrageous I performed, the stronger I would become.’

The woman, who first visited Lang when she was 19, carried on the sessions for more than three years, during which time she was instructed on reaching higher levels of ability, described in terms of ‘levels’ and ‘colours’.

She said: ‘If you didn’t dance to his tune, all hell would break loose. Bad things would happen. I’d lose my colours if I didn’t do what he wanted.’

The woman continued: ‘Thinking about it now it makes me feel sick. I’m embarrassed and ashamed about what I had to do, but I was completely controlled. He mentally abused me.

‘I met Karl at a very vulnerable stage in my life. He made me feel special. His eyes were warming and he made me feel safe and comfortable. I saw Karl as my saviour.’

She added: ‘After Karl was arrested, he rang me and begged me not to say anything. He said, “I’m big time in the s***, please don’t hang me”.’

Lang, of Newport, South Wales, is accused of tricking the two women into carrying out sexual acts during the séance sessions.

Newport Crown Court has heard they were also told to send him naked pictures of themselves on their phones.

The other victim, now 27, said: ‘The first time I stripped off my clothes he said “Well done! You’ve gone up a level in the spiritual world”. He told me the more outrageous I behaved, the higher level I would get. It was like a reward system.’

Trial: Lang, of Newport, South Wales, (Newport Crown Court is pictured) is 
accused of being a 'sexual fraudster' to trick two women into sexual 
acts during séance sessions

On one occasion after obeying his 
sexually explicit instructions, she told the court: ‘Karl congratulated 
me by saying: “I didn’t think you had it in you – you really pleased the
spirit world”. I felt uncomfortable.’

She added: ‘He asked me to talk about 
my sexual fantasies during meditations. I would be naked with my eyes 
closed. He told me to imagine having sex. He said: “Be as outrageous as 
you want, don’t just have one man, have five”.’

The alleged victim contacted Lang in 
an attempt to get in touch with her father, who died ten years ago. She 
later told police she felt ‘brainwashed, manipulated and groomed’.

The court heard that Lang had warned 
the woman not to tell anyone about his methods because he was the 
‘reincarnation of Jesus Christ’.

He told police he was ‘totally 
shocked’ when one of his alleged victims stripped in one of his 
sessions. He denied asking them to strip, perform sex acts on themselves
and send him explicit photos, describing their evidence as ‘wicked 
lies’.

He denies 12 counts of causing women to engage in sexual activity without consent. The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
