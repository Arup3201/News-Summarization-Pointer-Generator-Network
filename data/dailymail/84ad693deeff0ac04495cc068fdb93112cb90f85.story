This incredible image of Italy was captured by crew members aboard the International Space Station 200 miles from Earth.

NASA astronauts Alexander Gerst and Reid Wiseman, part of Expedition 40, shared their spectacular view on social media sites for the world to see.

Almost the entire country can be seen in the picture, recognisable by its iconic ‘boot’ shape, photographed last Saturday night from outer space.

A small part of Sicily can also be seen in the lower left-hand corner and allows people to see what the country looks like lit-up like never before.

The International Space Station (ISS) is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

The habitable satellite was launched in 1998 and has been continually occupied for almost 14 years - the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit.

Crew members have taken a host of stunning images, which they share via their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feeds.

They also post updates of their day-to-day life aboard ISS, giving viewers and insight into life as an astronaut.

The image of Italy received almost 5,000 likes on Facebook and was shared more than 7,000 times.

The space station travels at about 205 miles above the Earth and reaches speeds of 7.65km per second and has made 89,736 orbits.
