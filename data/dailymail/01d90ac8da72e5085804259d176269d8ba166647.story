For most school children, being a millionaire is something they dream of - but for Ollie Forsyth, it could be a not-too-distant reality.

The 17-year-old entrepreneur, who is studying at The Peter Jones Enterprise Academy backed by Dragons' Den's Peter Jones, is adamant he's going to hit the landmark by the time he's 20.

And if his career history to date is anything to go by, he could be right.

Ollie, pictured outside his home in front of his Herbie Beetle, started making money aged six when he made his parents tea and coffee and charged them 20p a cup - now his net worth is around £280,239

Ollie said he was determined to prove his haters wrong after suffering 'constant' bullying

Ollie started his first business aged 13, an e-tailer called Ollie’s Shop, and turned over £13,000 profit in the first year. Since then, the shop turns over £30,000 annually and is doubling yearly. 

Ollie, from Pury End, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, told FEMAIL: 'My entrepreneurial career started aged six when I made my parents tea and coffee and charged them 20p a cup.

'I didn’t need to pay for any of the resources, just the labour. 

'I had a car-wash business, sold my parents' vegetable patch yearly, and had a tuck shop at school making £7,000 a year.'

Like a lot of entrepreneurs - including Steve Jobs, Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Branson - Ollie is dyslexic and admits he 'really struggled at school'.

His father Angus, an insurance broker, and his mother Melanie, who runs an interior design business, sent him to the specialist Bruern Abbey School in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

Ollie said: 'I went to special needs school, which helped me with my dyslexia and was fantastic. 

'I then moved to Milton Abbey school in Dorset where I had the three worst years of my life, constant bullying and cyber bullying.'

Ollie didn't talk to anyone about the issues, but finally plucked up the courage to talk to the school's American counsellor who told him: ‘You've just got to go for it and you will be a billionaire one day, my friend.’ 

'This is what drove me to success,' Ollie said. 'I was bullied that much, I wanted to end my life, but, I said to myself: "I am going to be a millionaire one day and those bullies will be working for me".'

Undeterred by struggles with school work, the youngster turned to business and was determined to succeed, counting Virgin boss, Sir Richard Branson, as his idol.

'I wanted to create a luxury inexpensive gift shop,' he explains. 'Within the first year, I turned over £13,000 profit aged 13, since then, we are turning over £30,000 yearly and doubling yearly. 

'Since starting The Peter Jones Enterprise Academy, I have recently started my own enterprise magazine, The Budding Entrepreneur.

'I wanted a website that gives future budding entrepreneurs the resources, tools and business templates to make their business innovative but, most importantly, viable. 

'We launched on November 1 and since starting we have 4,000 readers and counting.'

If that wasn't enough, OIlie has a book coming out in America in 2016 and has 'lots of other exciting projects on the go'. 

He added: 'My passion is encouraging entrepreneurs to start their own business. Sir Richard Branson is the main entrepreneur who got me here, he has inspired me so much and he’s very dyslexic too and he started his magazine aged 16 too.' 

The budding businessman is even getting set to channel Lord Alan Sugar by launching his own enterprise competition, which will support and mentor other young entrepreneurs like him 

He also owns more than 500 diecast model cars potentially worth £10,000, which he bought for £800

Despite his riches, Ollie never keeps money in the bank. He has classic cars including a rare original Austin Ulster and The Herbie Beetle. He also has more than 500 diecast model cars potentially worth £10,000, which he bought  for £800.

The budding businessman is even getting set to channel Lord Alan Sugar by launching his own enterprise competition. 

'Students aged between 13-20 have the opportunity to pitch their ideas to me and the entrepreneur with the best idea will receive £1,000 investment from myself with a 50/50 partnership, as well as mentoring from myself and well-known entrepreneurs,' he explains.

He added: 'I aim to be a millionaire before I'm 20 so I can support future budding entrepreneurs. My net worth is currently £280,239 ($423,000). 

'I am determined to prove those bullies wrong and I guess I have done.'
