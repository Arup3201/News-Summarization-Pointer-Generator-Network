Fashion icon and former interior decorator Iris Apfel is selling more than 800 pieces of vintage furniture, jewelry, and accessories on the luxury flash sale website One Kings Lane.

Mrs Apfel, 92, who is based in New York, was involved in design restoration projects for nine different presidents at the White House including Kennedy and Clinton.

Now a trendsetter in her own right, and famed for her love of bold jewelry, she is clearing out her warehouse storage unit.

Treasures for sale: Fashion star Iris Apfel, 92, will sell more than 800 items from her personal archives on luxury flash sale site One Kings Lane

She told Refinery29: ‘I've had all 
these things for many, many years, and they were a part of my home 
furnishing career. I kept holding onto them because I was thinking I'd 
go back into that business, but then all the fashion stuff came my way. I
 had those beautiful things lying in fallow in a warehouse — it was time
 to let go.’

Among the items
 are vintage European frame chairs, etched Asian furniture, and objets 
d'art including a pair of porcelain poodles.

‘It's
 from so many years and so many places. Not just Europe, but the Middle 
East and Far East, so it's a very worldly collection,’ she said.

There is also an extensive array of pieces from Mrs Apfel's jewelry collection, including many of her trademark bangles.

The
 sale, which starts Saturday, will be divided into five categories: 
furniture and lighting, jewelry, art and wall decoration, decorative 
accessories and tabletop and textiles and rugs.

They will only be available to members of the site for seven days, and prices have not yet been released.

But Mrs Apfel did admit that their cost – much like many items on One Kings Lane – is rather high.

‘There are a number of things that are very unusual and ridiculously priced,’ she told Elle Decor.

While Mrs Apfel made her name in interior design, she has been known as of late for her eclectic taste in fashion.

Far away lands: Many of the items for sale were sourced from Mrs Apfel's travels, including this embellished elephant

In the last few years her bold, colorful wardrobe has spawned collaborations with HSN and MAC cosmetics.

But to her, ‘fashion and décor are one and the same.’

She
 explained: ‘One you're dressing yourself and the other you’re dressing 
the room. And, with myself I'm not changing my personality whether I'm 
in a room or in a dress. The same attitude applies — it's more of a 
lifestyle.’
