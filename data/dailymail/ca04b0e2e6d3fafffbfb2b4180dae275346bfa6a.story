Investigation: An inquest said the true details of Mr Duggan's death could take six months to emerge

Mark Duggan - the police shooting victim whose death sparked riots in Tottenham - did not fire at officers before he was killed, tests have suggested.

Ballistic analysis has indicated that a handgun found at the scene where Mr Duggan was killed by police had not been used, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed today.

The 29-year-old, said to be a key member of a crack-dealing gang, died from a single gunshot wound to the chest last Thursday.

It was the trigger for Saturday night's rioting in Tottenham which, in turn, led to the further unrest on Sunday and last night.

Investigations show that Mr Duggan's death came after two shots were fired by a Scotland Yard CO19 firearms officer.

The initial results confirmed reports that a bullet found lodged in a police radio at the scene was police issue.

Forensic officers have told the IPCC that it may not be possible to 'say for certain' whether the handgun found near Mr Duggan was fired.

Inquiry: The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now launched an investigation into the shooting at Tottenham Hale

But an IPCC statement said: 'At this 
stage there is no evidence that the handgun found at the scene was fired
 during the incident.'

The IPCC said investigation into the circumstances of the shooting were continuing with a CCTV trawl of the area.

Mr Duggan was a passenger in a silver
 Toyota Estima people carrier minicab in Ferry Lane, close to Tottenham 
Hale Tube station, which was believed to have been stopped by police.

Earlier it had been revealed Mr Duggan was carrying a blank-firing handgun converted to fire live bullets when he was killed.

The father-of-four was armed with the pistol converted to fire live bullets when he was shot by armed police officers.

Such a weapon is popular among London's drug gang members.

Reports
 have claimed that Mr Duggan did not open fire on police before he was 
shot dead at close range by a specialist firearms officer.

At the opening of the inquest into his death, it was revealed that Mr Duggan was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest.

He
 died last Thursday evening 15 minutes after reportedly sending a text 
to his partner Semone Wilson saying: 'The Feds are following me'.

It was also revealed at Mr Duggan's inquest that the investigation into the 29-year-old's death may take up to six months.

While the shooting is being investigated the family may not receive any details of what happened to Mr Duggan.

Mr Duggan's body was released for the family to prepare for the funeral. 

Mr Duggan was shot dead by armed officers from Operation Trident in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, shortly after 6pm on Thursday evening.

His death sparked three nights of rioting which began after a vigil outside Tottenham police station on Saturday evening.

North London Coroners officer Sandra Claxton said: 'On Thursday August 4th at 18.15 as a result of a pre-planned police operation by officers from Trident, he was stopped in a mini-cab in Ferry Lane.

'Police stopped the vehicle and then shots were fired resulting in his death.

'On August 5th a post mortem was carried out at Haringey mortuary. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest.

'Mr Duggan was formally identified by his family on August 6th.'

Coroner Andrew Walker, opening the inquest, said: 'I have reasonable 
cause to suspect that he died in circumstances that require an inquest.'

Deputy
 Senior Investigator Colin Sparrow, from the IPCC, told the hearing: 
'This is a complex investigation and yes, I request an adjournment.'

Mr Walker agreed to an adjournment, asking: 'How long do you need to prepare your report and investigation?'

Mr Sparrow replied: 'It is in its early stages, but I would say four to six months.'

Mr Duggan's fiancée Semone Wilson 
looked unhappy and shook her head when she heard how long the family 
would have to wait until the full details of how Mr Duggan was killed 
are revealed.

Mr Duggan's 
family said after the hearing they were 'deeply distressed' by the riots
 which swept London and other parts of the country in the aftermath of 
his death.

Helen Shaw, from
 charity Inquest, making a statement on behalf of the family outside 
North London Coroner's Court this morning, said: 'The family have asked 
me to say we came to the opening of the inquest today.

Inferno: Duggan's death sparked riots throughout Tottenham which proved incredibly destructive

Police: Officers had numerous show-downs with protestors angry at Duggan's death

'The investigation is ongoing and we want to establish the truth.

'The family want everyone to know that the disorder going on has nothing to do with finding out what happened to Mark.

'They also want people to know they are deeply distressed by the disorder effecting so many communities across the country.'

A pre-inquest review has been set for December 12.
