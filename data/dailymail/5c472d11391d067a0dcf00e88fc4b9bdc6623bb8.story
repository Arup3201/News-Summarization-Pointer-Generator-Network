For most people getting a parking fine would be enough to ruin their day.

But England captain Wayne Rooney could not stop smiling after  a traffic warden left a yellow ticket on his £100,000 silver Range Rover outside his favourite Chinese restaurant in Manchester.

Rather than deal with it himself he then handed the ticket to his long-serving agent Paul Stretford, who looked a little less pleased.

Just the ticket: Wayne Rooney was unperturbed after getting a parking ticket in Manchester and smiled as he handed it to his agent Paul Stretford

Small change: Rooney earns enough in two minutes to pay the £60 fine thanks to his £300,000-a-week deal with Manchester United 

Rooney is unlikely to be perturbed by the £60 ticket because it only takes him two minutes to earn the amount thanks to the  £300,000-a-week deal he signed with Manchester United last year.

The striker was filming a promotional campaign at Wing's Chinese Restaurant accompanied by his manager and brother-in-law Joe McLoughlin, his wife Coleen's younger sibling.

The 29-year-old star posed with a dragon mascot in the venue's dining area and posted the picture on his official Facebook account with the caption: 'Had a good day filming yesterday at my friend Wing's restaurant and learning about Chinese New Year.' 

Wing's is known to be a favourite for Rooney, who held his birthday celebrations there last October, dining out with his family and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart.

Wing's Restaurant is a popular haunt for Rooney and he held his birthday celebrations there last year with his family and other footballers

Rooney was not the only England star with a relaxed attitude to parking tickets this week.

Yesterday morning Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool's Melwood training ground  to prepare for tonight's important clash with Tottenham with a yellow parking ticket clearly visible on the windscreen of his white Range Rover.
