Rafael Nadal swept into the last four of the Madrid Open after beating Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2 on Friday to set up a semi-final against the tournament's surprise package, unseeded Spanish compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut.

World number one Nadal has not been his dominant best on his favoured clay this year, losing in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, but had a relatively easy ride against the outclassed Czech sixth seed, whom he has now beaten 18 times in 21 meetings on all surfaces and 17 times in a row.

The defending champion in the Spanish capital, Nadal broke the Berdych serve three times without losing his own and, with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic withdrawing and Andy Murray knocked out on Thursday, remains firmly on course for a fourth Madrid Masters crown.

Nadal said his performance was probably his best of the clay swing, good news for the Mallorcan as he gears up for a tilt at a record-extending ninth French Open crown later this month.

'My play is good when I'm hitting my forehand well, especially on clay,' said Nadal, who is vying for his third title in the Spanish capital.

'In Monte Carlo I used my backhand more and not my forehand, and when I have to hit five or six backhands in a row it doesn't help my game.'

'It was a match with a lot of intensity and perhaps it was my toughest match until now in the tournament,' Nadal told a news conference.

'To make it to the semi-finals for the first time in the clay season here in Madrid is great news for me,' added the 27-year-old, who is chasing a 63rd career title and a 44th on clay.

'I just managed to go over a barrier in the quarter-finals with a complex opponent.

'I've been two weeks without doing that and I'm happy for that. Now I just need to make an extra effort.

'I have to keep on going along the line that I've been going, which is each day a little bit better.'

'I brought great energy and intensity to it and that's the best news, that it's my best (on clay) yet,' Nadal said. 'The things that, historically, I've done well on this surface I managed to do them again today.'

Bautista Agut, ranked 45, had never reached the last eight of a Masters event before this week and continued his dream run with an efficient performance against Murray's conqueror, 46th-ranked Colombian qualifier Santiago Giraldo.

A promising soccer player in his early teens, the unheralded 26-year-old Bautista Agut has two top 10 wins this year, defeating number five Juan Martin Del Potro at the Australian Open and Berdych in Indian Wells.
