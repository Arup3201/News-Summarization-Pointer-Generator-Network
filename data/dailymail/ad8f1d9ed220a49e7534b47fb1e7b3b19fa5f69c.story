Catholic groups are up in arms with ObamaCare, President Barack Obama's flagship healthcare program, claiming that the government is 'blind' to the full implications of the contraceptive mandate.

Catholic groups - led by the Little Sisters of the Poor - are currently challenging the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court.

The groups say the ObamaCare requirement for group health plans to provide contraception violates their religious beliefs.

On New Year's Eve Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted a temporary injunction which meant the group - and others - can opt out while the challenge continues.

However, the government says the injunction should never have been granted as such groups are already exempt through an 'accommodation'.

Under an accommodation, religious non-profits sign a form which means contraception is administered - and paid for - through a third party organization.

The administration adds the Little Sisters are also part of the Christian Brothers Services - which also exempts them.

But Catholics argue they cannot sign away the responsibility to administer contraception to a third party - as they would then be sinning of their behalf.

Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer for 
the Little Sisters, says the government is 'simply blind to the 
religious exercise at issue: the Little Sisters and other applicants 
cannot execute the form because they cannot deputize a third party to 
sin on their behalf.'

In court papers, he says the government’s 'causal dismissal' of that 'religiously 
forbidden act as a mere "stroke of their own pen" perpetuates their 
claim below that the Little Sisters are fighting an ‘invisible dragon.'

Another lawyer for the nuns, Kevin C.
 Walsh of the School of Law University of Richmond writes, 'The 
government’s incomplete characterization of the form is that it is a 
simple opt-out form that does nothing but signal that the organization 
is claiming an exemption.'

However, Professor Michael C. Dorf of Cornell Law School says groups are wrong.

Speaking with ABC news, he claims the Little Sisters' emphasis on the form is misguided.

'I would say that even if the consequence of signing the paper were that the employees get contraceptive coverage, that still would not count as a substantial burden under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

'Suppose that a Quaker who is categorically opposed to war gets a draft notice. If the Little Sisters plaintiffs are right, then he is not only entitled to his exemption from the draft; he’s entitled to get his exemption without even signing the piece of paper saying he is entitled to his exemption. Why?

Because if he signs that piece of paper, then the government will draft the next person on the list and so he will be 'participating' in the war effort to which he is religiously opposed.'

The Little Sisters could be granted to opt out by the Supreme Court at any time.
