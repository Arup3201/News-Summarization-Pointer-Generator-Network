Smiling at the scene of a fatal bus crash in which 36 people died has led to a safety official losing his job.

After photos emerged on the internet of Yang Dacai grinning on a highway in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, province officials said in a statement they had stripped him of all his official duties for 'serious wrongdoing.' 

His jovial expression on August 26 was seen as unsympathetic and caused mass public outrage.

'My heart was heavy when I reached the scene... Junior officials appeared nervous when they were updating me on the situation,' he said to defend himself, reported the BBC.

'I was trying to get them to relax a little, so maybe, in an unguarded moment, I got a little too relaxed myself.'

Yang then found himself targeted by netizens when photos emerged of him wearing 11 luxury wristwatches.

Although Yang claimed he purchased the watches with his own salary, internet users argued that a public servant could not possibly afford the expensive watches.

The BBC reported that he explained that he 'used legal income' to buy a number of watches.

He claimed the most expensive one he owned was worth 35,000 yuan ($5,550, £3,420).
