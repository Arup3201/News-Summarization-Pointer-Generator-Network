Stuart Richmond, 30, hit Lucas Hibbert when his van was speeding in a 30mph zone, sending the boy flying through the air and causing serious head and body injuries

A judge has condemned a decision to prosecute a police patrolman for dangerous driving after he accidentally knocked down a schoolboy whilst answering a 999 call.

PC Stuart Richmond, 30, approached a red light at up to 40mph and hit 13-year old Lucas Hibbert on a pedestrian crossing whilst responding to an emergency request for help from a colleague.

The youngster, from Salford, Greater Manchester, suffered serious injuries to his head and body was left in a coma.

He later regained consciousness and was back in school several weeks later but is still said to be recovering from 'life changing injuries.'

Richmond had his blue lights flashing on his patrol van at the time of the accident and hit Lucas at 38mph in a 30mph zone.

But he was accused of dangerous driving and faced a possible two years in jail after prosecutors said he 'made little or no effort to slow down' at the crossing.

At Bolton Crown Court the case against him collapsed after a senior officer who investigated the crash said the officer responded 'appropriately' to the 999 call.

Instead, Richmond pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of careless driving and was fined £350. His licence will be endorsed with five penalty points.

It emerged he had been on restricted driving duties for 18 months since the accident. He now faces misconduct allegations.

Passing sentence Judge Peter Davies said the trial had been 'unnecessary' and it was 'regrettable' that it had gone ahead.

The judge added: 'It's a great shame that so much time and so much public money has been spent and a young man working hard on his profession should have to endure so much for 18 months.

'There should be some more objectivity at the CPS. There really should be some objectivity. In these days when public money is at a premium, it was not appropriate to put Mr Richmond in this ordeal.'

The accident happened in Swinton, Salford, on October 1, 2011, whilst Richmond was responding to a call from another police officer after trouble flared in a pub.

Lucas - who was with two friends - crossed the main road while riding his scooter and when the traffic signals turned red he began to cross.

PC Richmond overtook a line of traffic which had stopped at the traffic signal and struck Lucas.

Prosecutors said expert analysis showed that by the time he reached the pedestrian crossing Richmond was travelling at 42mph - and skidded and hit Lucas at 38mph.

Tests showed he had been travelling at up to 51mph in the run up to the crash. CCTV footage confirmed the traffic signal had been red for around five seconds before the impact.

Prosecutors say he failed to follow police driving guidelines stating that red lights should be treated like a 'stop' or a 'give way' sign.

But Inspector David Peach, a senior traffic officer at West Yorkshire Police, who investigated the crash said he believed PC Richmond had 'a momentary lapse of concentration' as he arrived at the crossing and didn't anticipate Lucas crossing the road.

During pre-trial proceedings the Crown Prosecution Service had been asked to review their evidence, but officials continued with the case.

Richmond's lawyer Robin Sellars said there had been a 'very prolonged failure' by the CPS to 'address the situation rightly'.

Today, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said Greater Manchester Police were considering misconduct matters against the officer.

IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'The public expects police officers to respond quickly to emergencies and as a result officers are given certain powers and rights.

'However those rights cannot and should not give permission to drive in a way that puts the public at risk.

'PC Richmond drove through a red traffic light without any caution and seemingly without any perception of the risk. As a result a young boy sustained life changing injuries.

'I wish Lucas well in his continued recovery. Today's outcome should serve as a reminder to police officers that their powers and rights must be used with caution and great care.'

A CPS spokeswoman said: 'We note the outcome of the case and we will carefully consider the remarks made by Judge Davies.'
