Driven up the wall by junk emails, cold calls and aggressive sales pitches?

Well, at least you’re not alone. Pushy salesmen, spam emails and having to deal with foreign call centres have topped a poll of Britain’s biggest modern life ‘bugbears’.

Other irritants include having to stand on the train, being bombarded with messages about mis-sold PPI policies and deliveries getting lost in the post.

Doorstep: Pressure selling - people continually trying to sell you something you don't want - topped the list

Among common household frustrations are forgetting to put the bins out and unloading the washing machine to find clothes covered in bits of tissue.

The study revealed the average person gets annoyed by something that is beyond their control up to seven times a day.

One-fifth of Britons admit they get irritated if they read a book and find spelling errors.

Losing the remote control, breaking a nail and missing the train also appear on the top 50 list.

Junk mail: Having to deal with spam emails is also a common bugbear for people, according to the research

Stacey Stothard from Skipton Building Society, which conducted the study of 2,000 adults, said: ‘For many Brits, their bugbears cause a short-term annoyance or an inconvenience.

‘Most are unavoidable and we have a little moan before showing true British spirit and getting on with the rest of our day.

‘But from the 50 bugbears, two out of the top three in our list are avoidable.
