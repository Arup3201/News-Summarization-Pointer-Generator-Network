Many children of single or separated parents long to see their mother or father find happiness with a perfect new partner.

But one daughter has gone a step further and has taken matters into her own hands - by using social media to help her mother find love.

Emily Wheeler from Bluntisham in Cambridgeshire has set up a Facebook page called Date My Mum to help mother Roz find a boyfriend.

Twice divorced Roz Naderer, 58, has had a string of unsuccessful relationships and disastrous dates over the years.

Emily, 30, created the Facebook page titled Date My Mum after growing frustrated with the men her mother had found through more conventional roots

The page, which features pictures of Roz along with life updates, had received 42 'likes' at the time of going to press

Tired with seeing her mother hurt, Emily, 30, took the unusual step of setting up a Facebook page to help her find a new man.

After years of seeing her mother date men who were ‘liars, cheats, smelly or plain weird’ Emily, has created the Facebook page titled Date My Mum.

She is desperate to find a new partner for her mother who she says ‘deserves to be treated like a queen.'

Emily came up with the idea after chatting to husband Simon, 42, who works as a graphic designer and helps companies to market themselves on Facebook.

He thought he could apply his expertise to help his mother-in law find a man with whom she can spend the rest of her life.

‘My gorgeous mum is single and looking for a man to sweep her off her feet,’ writes Emily on the Facebook page.

‘She's been on some dates with guys who have turned out to be liars, cheats, smelly or just plain weird - and so I'm taking it upon myself to try and find her someone suitable!'

Emily and Roz are obviously extremely close and share several snaps of them together on the Facebook page

Emily says on the page: 'As you can see, from head to toe, my Mum is gorgeous!'

Pictures of Roz can be seen along with little updates on her life and activities: 'The lovely Ms Naderer is off to live it up in 
the USA for a week, please keep sharing the page, although she may come 
back with an American Millionaire?!?'

In one sweet snap, Roz can be seen in a swimming pool with one of her grandchildren, both beaming at the camera in the sunshine.

Emily captions the picture: 'Mum on holiday spending some time with the grandkids. She's a real family woman and her children and grand-children come first in everything. Any suitor would have to share her family values and priorities.'

Emily says the idea for the unconventional dating method from talking with her husband Simon who help companies market themselves on Facebook

The page, which was only created 4 days ago, has so far received 42 ‘likes’ but Emily is keen to increase the number of people who see the site.

She asks visitors: ‘In order for the net to reach wide and far, and to stand the best chance of bagging that elusive 'normal man' could you please share with your friends and family.’

As she quite rightly points out: ‘You never know where he might be hiding!’
