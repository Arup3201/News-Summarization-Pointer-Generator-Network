Tiki Barber has revealed he and the 23-year-old woman he left his pregnant wife for are expecting their first child together.

The retired New York Giants running back married one-time mistress and girlfriend Traci Johnson in a civil ceremony in New York's City Hall in July, eight days after his divorce to his wife of 11 years, Ginny, became final.

Speaking on 'Bethenny,' he told America that his fifth child, and Johnson's first, was due in December before rubbing his young bride's belly as the live audience applauded. The episode will air this coming Tuesday.

The controversial former NFL star, 37, 
said on his way to the Manhattan Marriage Bureau in the summer: 'It's a 
great day. We're finally getting married.'

A polarizing figure, Barber left his 
wife, Ginny, in 2010, even though she was eight months pregnant with 
twin girls, after beginning an affair with Johnson in 2010.

At the time, Barber was working for 
NBC's 'Today' show with ambitions to be a serious journalist, but lost 
his job soon afterwards due to indifferent responses to his reporting 
skills.

The affair with the
 former NBC intern and Maxim pinup girl did not help his cause either, 
as public opinion turned massively against Barber, who appeared in the 
XXXV Superbowl in 2000.

Taking
 to Twitter to confirm the news of their marraige, Barber said, 'Many 
thanks to the NYC Clerk's office, especially James Mitchell who married 
me to my love @TraciLJohnson! Excited for the next chapters.'

Johnson
 and Barber had planned to get married on May 12 in the Hamptons, 
however, his divorce to his wife of 13-years had not been finalized and 
the ceremony was postponed.

After
 the ceremony, Jonson tweeted 'We're married @barber_tiki !!!!!!' and 
posted a variety of pictures from their happy day, including one of both
 bride and groom wearing their wedding rings.

Barber has hit the headlines repeatedly over the course of his playing career and in retirement.

During his final playing days at the New York Giants he became critical of the coach Tom Coughlin's playing style.

previously clandestine affair in 2010 and Barber met Johnson (right) 
when she was an intern at NBC and he was working on the 'Today' show

And in 2007, Barber questioned the 
leadership skills of the Giant's star quarterback, Eli Manning, who has 
since gone onto to deliver two Superbowl titles to the Giants, both 
without Barber.

Also, Giants fans angrily booed Barber when he was inducted into the Giants' Ring of Honor in October 2010.

Before
 his clandestine affair with Johnson became public, Barber was thought 
of as a committed family man, already the father of two sons and the 
expectant father of twin daughters.

He met his wife, Ginny Cha at the University of Virginia when they were both students.

Barber incurred the wrath of New 
York's Jewish community last year when he described his secret affair 
with Johnson conducted in his friends attic apartment as being like the 
tragic story of Anne Frank.

Meeting
 his bride-to-be at his lawyer, Mark Lepselter's apartment, to hide the 
tryst from his wife,Â  Baxter made ill advised comments.

'Lep's Jewish,' said Barber to Sports Illustrated's Jon Wertheim reported the New York Post.

'And it was like a reverse Anne Frank thing.'

Barber told the New York Post last year that Johnson helped him get through last year, in the aftermath of his firing from 'Today'.

'I have a wonderful girlfriend who lives me and got me through those bad times,' said Barber.

In attendance yesterday were only close friends of the couple, including Barber's twin brother, Ronde, who still plays in the NFL for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
