It’s been one of the most indulgent shopping sprees in Hollywood history.

In just eight weeks, Lily James, the British star of Disney’s new blockbuster Cinderella, has worn more than £300,000 worth of frocks, shoes and jewellery designed by the glitziest names in fashion as she’s promoted her film.

From £3,000 Jimmy Choo shoes to a £35,000 gown and a £40,000 necklace, Claudia Connell and Eliza Scarborough reveal how Downton Abbey star Lily’s very special wardrobe would be a stretch even for Prince Charming’s bulging wallet.
