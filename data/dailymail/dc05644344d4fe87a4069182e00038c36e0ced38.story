Pool parties, police line-ups and working behind the bar are some behind-the-scene scenarios graphic designers from around the world have dreamed up as world leaders caught up at the G20 Summit.

While Australians held its breath to see if Prime Minister Tony Abbott would follow through with his 'shirtfront' threats to Russian President Vladimir Putin, designers were asked by crowdsourcing website DesignCrowd to create graphics that met the brief of 'What really goes on at the G20 Summit?'

The site received 16 submissions and Australian graphic designer stevenphillips23 took out top prize with his interpretation of the frosty reception Mr Putin received when he arrived Down Under for the weekend meeting in Brisbane.

In the days leading up to the summit, heads of state - including British Prime Minister David Cameron - slammed the Russian strongman for his aggression towards the Ukraine and his treatment of downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

It came after Tony Abbott said he would 'shirtfront' - an illegal tackle made in Australian Rules football where a player's shoulder aggressively knocks the chest area of another - last month when it emerged Russian-backed rebels were responsible for the tragedy.

Other entries included a recreation of Leonardo Di Vinci's iconic The Last Supper painting with U.S. President Barack Obama as Jesus and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping as his disciples with a plaque which read: 'Check please?'

DesignCrowd community manager Jo Sabin said they had received submissions from all over the world - including Australia, France, the U.S., India and Guatemala.

She said the site was looking for unusual creators who could have a bit of fun with a serious subject matter.

'You have some sort of idea with the reporting of media outlets, but we thought it would be fun to generate what happens behind the scenes at the G20,' Ms Sabin told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's an inherently comical scenario where world leaders - who are mainly men - come to town and talk about how they can retain and increase their wealth. 

'We don’t want to take ourselves too seriously.'

DesignCrowd engages a community of 420,000 designers not only on a professional level but also to 'have some fun', Ms Sabin said.
