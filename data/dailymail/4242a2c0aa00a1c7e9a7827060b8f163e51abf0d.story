England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands at Villa Park but he will have left impressed by a save from an American goalkeeper late on that ensured a goalless draw which ultimately satisfied both teams.

Brad Guzan reacted quickly to block a powerful shot from Newcastle substitute Siem de Jong, put clear by Remy Cabella, and preserve a second successive clean sheet for the first time since last November.

Only six players eligible for Hodgson started this match and none are England regulars. Of those, Fabian Delph impressed most, and it was he who burst forward to launch a counter-attack in the final minute before being crudely blocked by Mike Williamson.

The central defender was shown a second yellow card by Mike Dean and as he trudged off Alan Pardew brought off forward Ayoze Perez 13 minutes after he had been sent on so Steven Taylor could help see out the game.

In truth, two moments on the touchline did most to entertain. In the first half Pardew tried to rouse misfiring winger Cabella, who did well on his debut against Manchester City, by dancing a jig and pulling a toothy smile with his fingers. A short clip of Pardew’s performance became a hit on Twitter.

‘My girls will be laughing at me tonight,’ said Pardew. ‘I just felt he was trying too hard. He had a lot of publicity last week and he was a bit tense to start here. He had a couple of great situations that he didn’t deliver, and that’s not like him. I was trying to get him to play with a smile.’

There was black humour when opposing manager Paul Lambert was struck in a sensitive area by a water bottle flung from the hand of No 2 Roy Keane during a fiery reaction to a foul by Daryl Janmaat on Alan Hutton.

Lambert had booted the ball down the line in anger and as he turned back he was inadvertently caught by Keane’s missile. The pair shared a hug and the Irishman growled his displeasure at Janmaat.

‘You try and tell him not to throw a water bottle,’ joked Lambert.

Last season Lambert’s team struggled at home, losing a record 10 matches. But the mood was positive here after an opening-day win at Stoke and with a revamped defence, Villa should prove robust this season.

Hutton, making his first appearance here since May 2012, was excellent at right-back — covering across the back line and bringing the ball out with assurance — while Aly Cissokho, signed for £2m, was equally strong on the other flank.

Ron Vlaar is continuing his fine form from the World Cup and Philippe Senderos looks more composed than during his troubled spell at Fulham.

There were no shots on target for Villa — Charles N’Zogbia’s first-half free-kick which whistled past the post was their closest effort — but once Christian Benteke is back from achilles injury a genuine striking thrust should emerge.

‘After everybody’s doom and gloom about the football club last season we’ve certainly took the challenge on,’ said Lambert. ‘We were resolute.’

Newcastle had the majority of possession and Cabella should have at least tested Guzan when the ball fell to him at the far post in the 26th minute after Yoan Gouffran’s deflected shot. But he side-footed wide.

The visitors’ best period came soon after the interval when three chances came and went. First Cabella’s deep free-kick was headed back across the six-yard box by Williamson and Janmaat connected well to force a fine save from Guzan.

Minutes later Janmaat went close again when he cut in from the right and hit crisp left-foot shot narrowly over the bar. Then Cabella dinked a pass to Williamson, but he slashed wildly and missed the ball.

‘I thought we deserved to win,’ said Pardew. ‘I felt we controlled 75 per cent of that game.’

After Guzan’s heroics and Williamson’s marching orders, the heavens opened and Villa pushed forward but failed to find the breakthrough.
