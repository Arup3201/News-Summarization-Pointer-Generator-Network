Ouch: Murray County Deputy Brett Morrison was badly bitten on the face when he tried putting his arm around a police drug dog and take a selfie

A Georgia deputy sheriff was rushed to the hospital Monday after a police bit his face, ripping open his chin and lip.

Murray County Deputy Greg Morrison put his arm around the Malinois after a job well done in an attempt to take a selfie with his cell phone.

But the professional pup was in no mood for camaraderie and proved it with a vicious snap at Morrison's chin.

'It’s an act of aggression to them 
whenever you do that,' Major Greg Fowler told the Dalton Daily Citizen, 
referring to Morrison's ill advised decision to wrap an arm around the 
dog.

'The canine just responded by what was presented to him based on his training.'

The dog went straight for Morrison's chin and bit hard.

The deputy was left with a slashed lip and chin after a handler ordered him to back off the the dog quickly complied.

Morrison was rushed to an area hospital where he eventually received stitches.

'They had to do quite a bit of stitching in the lip area where (it had been opened up) in a pretty good gash,' Fowler said.

'We’re
 praying for the deputy and everything to be fine with him. He’s 
recuperating well, and we’re sorry for the incident, but you train 
animals, you train them to do certain things, and you don’t deviate from
 the training.'

Fowler told the Daily Citizen that the animal had never bitten anyone before and that an investigation is underway.

No one has been disciplined in the mean time.

Morrison is now at home recovering after receiving his stitches and had the following to say in an email to WRCB:

'I
 had my phone in my hand when the dog began rubbing its body against my 
legs and the legs of another deputy. The dog raised up and put his front
 feet on the other deputy's chest and then he did the same to me. While 
he had his feet on my chest and I was petting him with my left hand, I 
thought that would make a good photo. It was then that he bit me.'
