Forget barefoot shoes and complex carbohydrates, the biggest improvement to your running times could come from this smart jacket.

The Glowfaster sports jacket syncs with a runner’s smartphone and then uses lights to indicate whether they are running at the right pace.

It can also make its lights flash in time to music to motivate runners to keep their pace and warns other pedestrians and vehicles of the runner’s whereabouts.

Lights: The jacket flashes lights to indicate if a person is running at the right pace.

Built-in lighting strips can also flash in time to music to motivate a runner.

They are held in place with 'double zip attachments' that can be swapped with another colour or upgraded.

The lights are designed to help runners train more 'instinctively'.

Design: The jacket is designed by Joanna Kent, who created clothes for Abercrombie and Fitch.

App: An iPhone app works with the jacket to track a runner's performance.

Runners can set goals, look at their biofeedback and stats from optional heart rate monitors.

Music can be controlled via the app and games like the Bleep Test are compatible.

Material: The jacket is waterproof, windproof, breathable and washable.

Cost: £99 with 10% of profits going to charity.

Ex-marine Simon Weatherall came up with the idea of the jacket, which has been designed by Joanna Kent, who has created clothes for Abercrombie and Fitch.

The first prototype was a home-made jacket with lights stuck on with Velcro and sticky tape, but the garment now has zip-off lighting strips that react according to a runner’s performance, The Telegraph reported.

The ‘double zip attachment’ means that people will be able to upgrade their lights or add different colours.

The lighting pattern on the jacket lets runners recognise and respond ‘intuitively’ to feedback, according to the start-up, which originally set out to raise money on crowd-funding website Kickstarter.

The company said: ‘Using our smart-jacket
 can help you train more instinctively. It allows you to sync your 
body’s biomarkers such as your heart rate, or measure speed versus 
target via GPS, letting you know when you are at your target.’

Mr Weatherall claims that people respond naturally to lights on the jacket and are motivated by them, allowing themselves to go all-out when exercising.

‘You will continue to react and the biofeedback loop will keep your body and your motivation going. Your motivation and confidence will grow as your workout progresses,’ he said.

The jacket can integrate with GPS trackers and heart rate monitors and feed the information to the app via Bluetooth.

The company said: ‘Our app comes fully loaded to connect to your smart jacket. You can set your running pace and sync it with your jacket, set you target heart rate, flash the light in time with training aids and sound driven games like the Bleep Test - you can even link up to music on your iPhone.’

The jacket's lights are powered using a Bluetooth receiver called a Gizmo (pictured alongside a heart rate sensor). The jacket is waterproof, windproof and breathable and will cost £99

The jacket is waterproof, windproof and breathable and will cost £99.  It could be the first of other wearable technologies designed by the duo.

Mr Weatherall, who fought in the Iraq war, said he will donate 10 per cent of profits from the jacket to the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund.
