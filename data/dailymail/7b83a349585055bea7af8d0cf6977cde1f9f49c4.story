It's been called the laminated book of dreams but now the Argos catalogue can take its place alongside more historical documents.

Because as these photos show, the trusty Argos tome so popular with children in the run up to Christmas, can provide a fascinating insight into the changing tastes and aspirations of the nation over the past 35 years.

When artist and vintage lava lamp collector Anthony Voz found the 1976 catalogue at a recent car boot sale in London he decided to scan every single page and upload every one to the internet.

Look back in time: The Argos catalogue from 1976, found at a car boot 
sale in London, is providing an insight into how we used to shop .. and live

It was only when the 27-year-old was inundated 
with the recollections of people who saw the online version of the 
catalogue that he realised just how the humble book could unlock the 
years.

The vintage 
memorabilia collector had originally uploaded the pages to act as a 
reference for others with a love of old fashioned items.

How times have changed: The Argos catalogue 2011 edition boasting 1000 pages compared with just 250 in the 1976 edition

But as soon as the pages went live the London-based collector was overwhelmed by hundreds of messages of nostalgia from web users.

He said: 'The images act as a way to connect with people to discover their stories, their past and their memories.

'For example, people see teddy bears 
that they owned, or games consoles that they longed to own as a teenager
and the catalogues also shed light into how it was to live back then.

'Looking at the catalogues makes people remember parts of their life that they had forgotten.'

Even
a glance at the front cover of the glossy book from 1976 and today's 
brochure shows just how far technology has come both in terms of what is
inside and how the Argos catalogue looks today.

The 1970's version shows a happy 
family on the front cover while the 2011 edition features a tablet PC 
displaying the Argos website and a range of online purchasing options.

Typewriters,
adding machines, cassette players and ashtrays are just some of the 
things that either no longer appear or have a minimal amount of space 
now dedicated to them.

Writing on the wall: Typewriters, with their range of features listed in the catalogue, are virtually a relic of a past age with the advent of personal computers and now tablets like the iPad

Sound investment: Handheld portable radios were on the up in 1976, but today music on the move can be accessed and stored on mobile phones.

But technology is not only an area of British life that has changed.

The
pages from 1976 show just how far the nation's obsession with personal 
grooming and fitness has developed. In the 1970s the contents page lists
just one page of 'Keep Fit Equipment', today there is an amazing 40 
pages of sports gear.

Male
grooming in 2011 requires an electric razor which moisturises the skin 
during shaving while a sideburn trimming feature was the unique selling 
point for rugged 1970s man.

Isabelle
Szmigin, professor of marketing at The University of Birmingham, said 
that the range of products available today shows a change in attitudes 
and lifestyle.

Before the keep fit revolution: Home gym equipment was less popular with fewer products on offer than in 2011

She said: 'We will always see products that reflect the concerns of the day both socially and economically - there is lots of money to be made out of keep fit as we are all struggling to keep our weight down.

'The fact of the matter is that the amount of high fat and sugar foods were just much less in the 1970s so some products really do change to reflect the changed environment.'

The toy pages of the issue could be seen to show how we have developed a more PC attitude towards our kids.

Blast from the past: Six Million Dollar Man toys were all the rage and an action figure cost only £3.99 in 1976

Family brands: Lego and Meccano were favourites in 1976 with a Lego train set retailling at just £11.95

Modern-day kid’s bikes are plastered with images of popular cartoon characters, and feature a ‘parent handle’, which worried mums and dads can use to prevent wayward toddlers from straying.

And the replica guns and Wild-West dress up sets missing from today’s catalogue, suggest that a Saturday game of ‘Cowboys and Indians’ is a thing of the past.

Former household names, such as Matchbox and Tonka, are also conspicuous by their absence from the newer edition.

But there are also a number of similarities between the older catalogue and its brightly-coloured modern-day counterpart.

Toy story: The toys of the age paint a portrait of a life long past for the UK with Tonka trucks and Stockcar Smash Up on every boy's wishlist.

Hairstyling
products for women feature prominently in both catalogues, although 
hair straighteners rather than curling tongs dominate the modern-day 
version.

And a surprising number of household 
names make appearances in both catalogues.  Kodak, Phillips and Lego are
still as popular as they were 35 years ago, although today’s 
suspension-equipped Lego sports cars make the humble train and ambulance
sets of 1976 look more than a little outdated.

But
Professor Szmigin said that there are echoes of the 1976 catalogue in 
the modern day version, particularly when it comes to their 
presentation.

She said: 'In some ways I think it is surprising how similar the items and ways of presenting them are.

Well groomed: The lady of the 1970s had a vast array of products at her disposal to ensure she achieved the look of the age.

Close shave: The gentleman of the 1970s was being encouraged to look 
after his appearance with the 'Philishave De Luxe' boasting 12 blades and
an integral trimmer for £15.75

'In marketing we talk about the product life cycle and it is fascinating to watch how toys go or don’t go through this cycle.

'Barbie and Lego have stayed more or less the same for years. Others, such as Action Man tendto come and go but toys remain largely the same.'

One thing that is very different between 1976 and 2011 is the number of products on offer - the old catalogue was just 250 pages, while this year’s contains over 1,000.

Professor Szmigin added: 'Whatever we hear about Austerity Britain the fact of the matter is that we just have a lot more stuff now than ever before - in some ways many of us don’t know the meaning of the word austerity.'

Timely reminder: In 1976 a ladies dress watch retailed for just £13.95 with Argos

Jewellery gifts today: Accessorize and Alexandra Burke gifts are on sale
in this year's Argos catalogue but more indicative of the times is the information line at the bottom 
which allows buyers to text or log in
