The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have proved their relationship is still very much in the honeymoon period during their tour of New Zealand and Australia.

As they prepare to celebrate their third wedding anniversary on Tuesday, the bond between the royal pair seems stronger than ever.

While some couples find their relationship can be strained by having a baby, the arrival of Prince George seems to have brought Kate and Prince William even closer.

Whilst they have posed for formal pictures at landmarks including Sydney Opera House and Ayers Rock, it has been the informal glimpses we have seen of the two that have given a real insight into their union.

Body experts agree that the chemistry between William and Kate is undeniable while they clearly appear to be best friends as well as man and wife.

Their genuine affection for one another has helped endear them to the public throughout their travels.

Nicky Park wrote in the New Zealand Herald: 'In between all the pomp and ceremony, it was all the seemingly "real" royal moments that endeared us to William and Kate the most. The smiles, brief brushes and bits of banter between the two made us coo.' 

Their banter was obvious on occasions when they showed their competitive sides such as when they played cricket in Christchurch and took part in a yachting race in Auckland.

Body language expert Judi James told MailOnline 
the playful competiveness between the Royal couple symbolises the great 
strength of their relationship.

‘The
 men of the Royal family are often celebrated sporting figures whilst 
their wives sometimes take a slightly more compliant role,’ says James.

‘I
 think William loves the fact that Kate joins in and they can share 
these moments, but also that they have this competitive, playful side to their relationship.

‘It
 shows that, despite being the future King and Queen of England, they 
are actually a rather normal couple, too, who like to joke around with 
each other.

‘It shows that they are a real couple: They can laugh together. They are playmates.’

Furthermore, says James, it's a nod to the incredibly strong yet competitive relationship that Prince William and his brother Prince Harry share.

'William and Harry are famous for having this joke-competitiveness too,' says James.

'The fact William also has that with Kate, I think, makes them even closer and proves that they really are friends as well as husband and wife.'

And the couple's tactile nature is just what will help them get through their busy royal tour as, according to experts, a loving hand from a partner will reassure and help to calm.

‘The more a couple touch, the stronger the connection,’ says love and relationship expert, Tracey Cox.

‘Touch
 is incredibly important because it has a calm, reassuring effect on the
 body. It establishes you as a couple and sends strong mateship guarding
 signals.

‘Touching also allows some bonding hormones to be transmitted through the skin.

‘Kate and Wills are very tactile and there's lots of intense eye contact as well.

‘Their body language is that of a very close and intimately connected couple.’

They may be royalty but, like any 
other young couple in love, Kate and William just can't get enough of 
each other. And, even right from the start of their relationship, they 
haven't been afraid to let the whole world see just how much they love 
each other. Take a look back at some of their loved-up moments
