Teenage Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha, who won a Glasgow 2014 gold medal before failing a drugs test, has tested positive in a B test and will face a hearing in front of the Commonwealth Games Federation on Friday.

CGF chief executive Mike Hooper said the follow-up examination backed up the initial finding of the doping control that Amalaha went through after her victory in the 52kg class at the Clyde Auditorium on July 25.

The test on 16-year-old Amalaha revealed traces of diuretics and maskings agents.

Hooper said on Friday: 'I can report that the analysis on the Nigerian weightlifting Chika Amalaha's B sample has been completed, and this has confirmed the analysis and finding of the A result.'

Amalaha set a new Games records in her weight category in both the snatch and overall elements.

Hooper added in the Games daily media briefing: 'In accordance with the CGF's anti-doping standard, the next step of the process is a formal hearing before the federation court chaired by His Royal Highness Prince Imran.

'That hearing will take place this afternoon, and we will of course issue a statement on the outcomes on that hearing following the court's decision.

'I can't and won't speculate on what the outcome might be. We have a robust process in place that must be followed to ensure fairness to all.'

Ruled out: Amalaha won gold in the women's 53kg class but was suspended after her failed drugs test

When the 
failed test came to light on Tuesday, World Anti-Doping Agency president
 Sir Craig Reedie expressed his shock that someone so young should have 
failed a doping test, saying: 'I am very disappointed that somebody as 
young as that appears to have committed an offence at a multi-sport 
event like the Commonwealth Games.'

Drug use in weightlifting has begged questions over the sport's continued participation in the Commonwealth programme.

Nigerian
 weightlifting also has a history of drugs offences. The Nigerian 
Weightlifting Federation was suspended for repeated doping violations by
 the International Weightlifting Federation in 2001 and banned from 
competing in the following year's Manchester Commonwealth Games.
