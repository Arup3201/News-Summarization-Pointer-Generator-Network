Internet auction site eBay has closed down the online shop of an artist who admitted selling fake copies of works by LS Lowry for up to £3,000 each.

David Henty, 56, from Brighton admitted that on occasion he is 'inspired' by the artist and suddenly another Lowry appears before him.

However, eBay confirmed that they will suspend the accounts of anyone selling fake paintings using their service.

David Henty's copy of The Postbox, left, was withdrawn from eBay after the company was told it was a copy while the real version of the painting was sold at auction for £500,000

Last week, Henty's eBay page boated an 'oil painting on canvas titled The Postbox. Signed LS Lowry.'

The advert continued: 'No paperwork or provenance, sold as after LS Lowry.'

Henty told the Sunday Telegraph from his £500,000 home where he also paints: 'Sometimes I have a power. I get relaxed and all of a sudden there is a Lowry. He has come down, inhabited my body and there is a picture. You do feel like that. I was the only one doing Lowrys at first and now everybody is doing them badly. This is what kills me.

'The one I did the other day [The Postbox] was a lovely Lowry. They are not knocked up in two hours.'

He added: “I also do Monets. I love Monet. The Impressionists are quite easy to do. I am self taught. I have stacks of art books I read through. I can just do the signatures. You do get an affinity for the artist. You see things through their eyes. When I was in Spain I did loads of van Goghs.'

LS Lowry is one of Britain's most influential artists of the 20th century whose work reflected industrial scenes in areas surrounding Salford

Lowry, who was born in Stretford, Lancashire painted his native north with his very distinctive characters often described as 'matchstick men'

A eBay spokesperson said: 'Counterfeits are illegal and are not welcome on eBay. We take action against those who attempt to list counterfeit items and we are investigating the way we handled previous complaints against these sellers.

'We spend millions of pounds each year maintaining a safe site and have advanced detection measures and tools but we are sorry that in this instance we did not live up to our usual high standards in identifying and eliminating counterfeits.

'We have reviewed these accounts and recognise that some complaints have previously been received regarding counterfeits. In light of this, all these accounts and any others used by the sellers have now been suspended, and these individuals will not be permitted to sell on eBay again.'
