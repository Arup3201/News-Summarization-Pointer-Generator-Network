Over 50 people have been sickened - with one child and adult airlifted to hospital in a critical condition - following a carbon monoxide leak inside a remote Utah elementary school on Monday morning.

The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office said the incident was reported around 9.30 a.m. local time at the Montezuma Creek Elementary School, prompting an evacuation, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

About 300 children are believed to attend the school.

Staff called the Sheriff's office reporting that students and staff were dizzy and sick.

San Juan School District Superintendent Douglas Wright said the leak occurred as people arrived at the school and before the day’s classes started.

The exhaust of a faulty water heater system is suspected to have caused the leak, according to Clayton Holt, the business administrator for the San Juan School District.

A carbon monoxide leak Monday at Montezuma Creek Elementary in southeastern Utah elementary sickened over 50 people, with more than half that number hospital and two considered critical.

County Emergency Services Director Rick Bailey said paramedics were rushed to the school from Bluff, Monticello and Blanding, along with three Navajo National ambulances and police officers from several jurisdictions.

'A total of 30 students and adults were triaged at the scene,' Bailey said.

'Two patients, including one student and one [female] adult were transported via medical helicopter to area hospitals.'

He said 23 other students and adults went to local hospitals by ground transport.

The remained of the students were transferred to White Horse High School.

Holt said that as of early afternoon, doctors at Blue Mountain Hospital in Blanding, and at other area medical facilities, reported that all their patients were in good condition.

He said he understood the one adult female and one child airlifted from the school to more distant medical facilities remained in 'serious shape,' but he had no further information.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, however it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities.In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable, short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. A major industrial source of CO is producer gas, which is used to create heat and fuel equipment like ovens.

The school remained closed for the day as authorities further investigated the leak.

The school is on the Navajo Reservation about 15 miles west of the Colorado border.

Shawna Hamm, who lives in Aneth, a town about 8 miles southeast of Montezuma Creek, said she saw a helicopter fly past her house, as well as two Navajo Nation police officers with lights and sirens.

Earlier, she had received a text message from her sister-in-law, a cook at the elementary school, saying that there had been a gas leak and she was feeling dizzy.

Hamm’s nephew, a student at the school, also complained of dizziness.

While other children were being air- lifted to the hospital, her nephew’s father picked him up and brought him home, where he seemed to be doing fine, Hamm said.

She said her sister-in-law, who is about three months pregnant, got a ride to a hospital in Blanding to get checked out.

Montezuma Creek is located about 10 miles east of Bluff.
