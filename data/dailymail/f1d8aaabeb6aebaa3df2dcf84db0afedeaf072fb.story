Every mother knows about the risks of delivering a baby prematurely.

A baby born even a month earlier than
it is due, or preemie as we know it, can develop pneumonia, poor vision
and hearing, sleep problems and may even die.

And that's not all. Now a major 
study published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood says 
preterm babies can develop severe mental health problems too.

Increased risk: Babies born more than eight weeks premature are '4.5 times as likely' to suffer from a severe mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis

This is the first study of its kind to show a link between 
premature babies and a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later 
life.

They are at a high risk of developing bipolar disorders, severe 
depression and even eating disorders.

Researchers say that subtle 
alterations in the brain development caused by early birth could be 
responsible for the problem, rather than restricted growth or lack of 
oxygen during childbirth.

The news has left doctors in Delhi concerned, 
in view of the surge in births of premature babies.

'There has been a 10
per cent rise in preemies because of different lifestyle-related health
problems pregnant women suffer from.

'Gestational diabetes, polycystic 
ovaries, hypertension and cases of amniotic fluid leaks are common now 
and these are the high risk factors for a premature delivery.

'Late 
pregnancy is another reason for this worrying trend,' said Dr Asha 
Sharma, consultant gynaecologist, Rockland hospital.

Doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies - which are defined as being born at least three weeks early

Ideally, a baby 
should be delivered close to the 40th week, but babies are being 
delivered as early as the 32nd week.

The study finds that babies born 
four to eight weeks earlier are more likely to develop schizophrenia and
bipolar disorders and those born after just 32 weeks in the womb are 
three times more likely to have a psychiatric disorder by the age of 16.

'Premature babies are kept in neonatal care from between a week to a 
month.

'They are away from the vital pheromones that their mothers 
secrete and this could be the reason for psychological problems later.

'These babies are generally of low weight at birth and that impacts their
health a lot,' said Dr Manika Khanna, director, Gaudium IVF Centre.

While pediatricians are able to save preemies with the advancement in 
the neonatal technology, there is hardly any followup on their health 
later.

'We have no clue on what happens to our preterm babies. In India,
there is no proper large-scale study on their health status,' said Dr 
Khanna.

Health experts pointed out that it is important to identify 
susceptible children and keep track of their health status.
