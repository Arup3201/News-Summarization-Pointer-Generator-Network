Eidur Gudjohnsen scored his first goal for Bolton since May 2000 as struggling Leeds were denied victory in their quest to avoid relegation from the Sky Bet Championship.

The 36-year-old forward, who re-signed for the Trotters last month, scored with a fine penalty in the 48th minute to cancel out a third-minute spot-kick from United midfielder Rudy Austin as the match finished 1-1.

The visitors led when Sam Byram was brought down by Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan and Austin fired home confidently before Bolton levelled when Luke Murphy felled Darren Pratley and Gudjohnsen blasted home from 12 yards.

The result took Bolton's unbeaten home run to eight games but left Neil Redfearn's visitors without a win in their last six Championship outings.

With Gudjohnsen and Emile Heskey starting together for the first time, Bolton's veteran strikeforce had a combined age of 72.

Teenager Zach Clough, who struck the winner on his debut against Wigan in last weekend's FA Cup win, was missing due to injury while Steve Morison was the surprise inclusion in Leeds' starting line-up.

It was only the former Millwall man's third league start of the season as Redfearn made four changes to the side which lost 1-0 at Sunderland in the FA Cup.

Byram, Giuseppe Bellusci and Lewis Cook also returned with Dario Del Fabro, Adryan, Brian Montenegro and Mirco Antenucci all making way.

Leeds were handed a great early chance to take the lead when Bryam latched onto Cook's clever through ball and was brought down by Lonergan as he rounded the goalkeeper.

Referee Andy Woolmer pointed straight to the spot and Austin struck a powerful right-foot penalty into the net.

Lonergan escaped without as much as a yellow card and Leeds should have doubled their advantage in the 10th minute.

A cross from the right flank found Morison unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box and his firm header drew an outstanding save from Lonergan.

Morison should really have scored and Bolton midfielder Liam Trotter was soon booked for a late challenge on left-back Charlie Taylor.

In the 15th minute, Taylor did well to deflect Trotter's shot out for a corner, from which Matt Mills narrowly headed wide from close range.

Gudjohnsen saw a 25-yard free-kick sail inches wide of Marco Silvestri's left-hand post before Murphy had a long-range strike deflected out for a corner at the other end.

A brief deluge of rain and hail midway through the first half made the conditions increasingly difficult but it soon subsided.

In the 28th minute, Trotter went close with a header from close range following a corner which Silvestri repelled before producing another smart stop to deny Pratley's follow-up shot.

In the 37th minute, Mills made a vital interception to deny Morison after Byram headed a cross into his path on the edge of the six-yard box.

Bellusci was booked for catching Heskey with a stray arm in added time at the end of a first half which saw Leeds establish a 1-0 advantage.

That was cancelled out when Liam Feeney's deep cross from the right was palmed away by Silvestri to Pratley, who was caught by Murphy's outstretched leg.

Gudjohnsen did the rest to fire high into the net, but chances remained scarce as the second half wore on.

Gudjohnsen had a powerful strike well blocked by Leeds captain Liam Cooper before Silvestri parried a fierce cross-shot from substitute Craig Davies.

Byram went close with a close-range shot for Leeds late on but both sides held on for a deserved share of the spoils.
