In egalitarian Sweden, not even a soon-to-be-married princess can get away with breaking the traffic rules. 

Princess Madeleine, 30, allegedly tried to dodge a fine for driving in the bus lane near the palace in Stockholm by claiming royal immunity.

The princess managed to convince the officer who pulled her over on Tuesday that her car had special permission to use bus lanes.

Royal bride: Sweden's Princess Madeleine faces a driving fine just a few days before her wedding

Lars Lindholm, who heads Stockholm's traffic unit, told the Aftonbladet newspaper:
'The policeman who stopped her felt an uncertainty around the immunity 
laws, and whether they applied to the whole royal family.

'Or if there 
could be an exception for cars from the Royal Court driving in the 
public lanes'

She now faces a fine of 1,000 krona (£100) on the basis that only her father,  the king of Sweden King Carl XVI Gustaf, has immunity in such cases.

However, according to the Aftonbladet newspaper, the controversy is not yet over.

Royal
Court spokesman Bertil Ternert argued that even though Madeleine 
herself does not have immunity, her royal car has special permission to 
use the public transit lanes.

Police spokesman Kjell Lindgren declined to comment. 

The princess, who is fourth in line to the Swedish throne, is also reportedly responsible for some of the 15 parking tickets that royal cars were issued in 2007.

Her fine comes four days ahead of her wedding to New York banker Christopher O'Neill.

On Friday, the eve of the wedding day, guests including the Earl and Countess of Wessexwill gather for a glittering dinner at Stockholm's Grand Hotel.

On Saturday, Princess Madeleine will marry at the Royal Chapel in Stockholm, followed by a 21-gun salute.
