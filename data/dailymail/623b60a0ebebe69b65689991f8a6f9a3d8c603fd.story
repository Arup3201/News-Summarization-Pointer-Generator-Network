Riot police clashed with hundreds of petrol-bomb hurling protesters in Athens yesterday as anger at austerity measures gripped Greece.

Up to 100,000 took to the capital’s streets during the largest anti-austerity protest seen there in more than a year.

They marched to the Greek parliament chanting ‘EU, IMF Out!’, on the day of a general strike against a new round of cuts demanded by foreign lenders.

As the rally ended, youths dressed in 
black threw stones, chunks of marble, petrol bombs and bottles at riot 
police, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray.

Several policemen were seen on fire as the battles continued, but it is thought that none was seriously injured.

Police chased the protesters through Syntagma Square in front of parliament as helicopters clattered overhead.

Smoke rose from small blazes in the 
streets. One group of hooded youths could be seen setting trees on fire 
in the National Gardens, causing flames and black smoke to fill the 
skyline above parliament. About 120 people were detained.

Dina Kokou, a 54-year-old teacher and 
mother of four who lives on £800 a month, said: ‘We can’t take it any 
more – we are bleeding. We can’t raise our children like this. These tax
increases and wage cuts are killing us.’

Demonstrators banged drums as they chanted, 'People, fight, they're drinking your blood' while other protesters hurled petrol bombs at riot police

Scenes of carnage: Everyone from shopkeepers and pharmacists to teachers, customs workers and car mechanics joined the demonstration, seen as a test of public tolerance for more hardship after two years of harsh spending cuts and tax hikes

The riots came less than 24 hours 
after similar disturbances in Spain where police fired rubber bullets at
protesters in Madrid, leaving some injured. Some demonstrators broke 
down barricades and threw rocks and bottles.

There was more violence during further anti-austerity protests in the Spanish capital yesterday.

In Athens, protesters marched to try 
to force the government to reject demands by the country’s international
lenders for additional cuts to salaries, pensions and benefits 
amounting to £9billion in savings over the next two years, along with 
another £1.5billion in taxes.

Greece has promised the spending cuts and tax increases in an effort to secure its next tranche of aid from the EU and IMF.

The 24-hour nationwide strike, called 
by the two biggest unions representing two million workers, is the first
test of whether prime minister Antonis Samaras can stand his ground.

Police estimated the demonstration was
the largest since a May 2011 protest, and among the biggest since 
near-bankrupt Greece first resorted to aid from international lenders in
2010 – which has come at the price of painful austerity cuts.

Ships stayed docked, museums and 
monuments were shut to visitors and air traffic controllers walked off 
the job for a three-hour stoppage.

Train services and flights were suspended, public offices and shops were shut, and hospitals worked on skeleton staff.

In another significant move towards 
EU ‘fiscal union’, eurozone leaders are to discuss establishing a 
central budget designed to help weak economies within the single 
currency area. It would be funded by rerouting a slice of national taxes
collected by eurozone members to Brussels.

The UK, which is not a member of the 
euro, will not contribute to the fund. But it will raise concerns that 
other countries are pushing ahead with integration that could hamper 
Britain’s interests, and it could strengthen Tory Eurosceptics’ desire 
to see powers ‘repatriated’ from Brussels. Yesterday it emerged that 
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has asked Tony Blair, Lord Mandelson 
and David Miliband for advice about how the UK should respond to 
ever-closer union.

The demonstration in Athens came just 24 hours after similar clashes in Madrid (pictured) where protesters battled with Spanish police
