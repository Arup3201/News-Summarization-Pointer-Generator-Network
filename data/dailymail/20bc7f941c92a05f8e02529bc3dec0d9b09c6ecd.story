Johnson started against Blackburn on Sunday and, asked afterwards about his contract, he said: 'No talks. At this point I have no idea (where I will be next season). 

'I haven't thought about it. It would be great for the kids to go abroad but I am not thinking about yet as we have two months left here and I'll think about it after that.

'We will have to wait and see.'
