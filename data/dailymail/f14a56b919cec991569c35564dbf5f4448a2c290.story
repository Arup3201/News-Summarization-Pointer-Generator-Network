Three Texas teenagers are dead and five were injured after the speeding truck they were in went out of control early Saturday morning with only one person wearing a seat belt.

Driver Robert 'Andrew' Russell, 18, Colbie Miller and Bailee Sims, both 19, died after his truck hit a tree and rolled several times into a ditch before 1.00 a.m., police said. Two of the five injured are hospitalized in serious condition, the other three were treated and released.

All eight injured were passengers inside Russell’s 2006 Chevrolet ‘Super-Duty’ pickup truck, according to KTVT. The only passenger wearing a seat belt suffered minor injuries and was released from the hospital.
