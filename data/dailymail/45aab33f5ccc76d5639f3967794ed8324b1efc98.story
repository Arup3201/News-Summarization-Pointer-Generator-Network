Former Labour minister Denis MacShane has had his court case for fiddling his expenses delayed until after his summer holiday, it emerged today.

Magistrates said they were 'mystified' by the decision to put off the case until after he returns from his pre-booked break on September 4.

The former Europe Minister has been charged with false accounting after prosecutors said there was enough evidence to bring a case over suspicious claims worth £12,900.

Former Labour MP Denis MacShane has been charged with false accounting over parliamentary expenses claims

The 65-year-old was given permission not to appear in court today to face a charge of false accounting over his expenses claims.

His lawyers told Westminster Magistrates' Court they needed more time to make progress with his case.

But Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said he was 'a little mystified' that yesterday another district judge had granted permission for the former Rotherham MP not to appear, but adjourned the case until September 10.

He said: 'There must be a large amount of paperwork that the solicitors need to go through. I'm a little mystified that the decision has been made and I can't look behind that decision.'

MacShane is accused of false accounting over alleged fraudulent claims of £12,900 for research and translation services.

Prosecutors announced earlier this month that he would face one count of false accounting following claims that he had faked receipts.

Today the court was told that he has a
pre-booked holiday from late-August until September 4, and that his 
legal team had asked for the case to be adjourned until after that date.

Prosecutor
William Hayes said that his solicitors had written to the court on July
19, mentioning 'the gravity and complexity' of the matter, and 
explaining the difficulty the team would have to 'make progress' by 
today.

MacShane quit the Commons last year, after 18 years as MP for Rotherham.

Prosecutors accuse the former outspoken MP of fraudulently charging taxpayers for research and translation services.

Announcing the decision to press charges earlier this month, Malcolm McHaffie, of 
the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘This charge 
relates to fraudulent claims with a total value of £12,900. The charge 
is of false accounting, contrary to the Theft Act 1968.

‘It is alleged that Denis MacShane claimed expenses for research and 
translation services carried out by a company that did not carry out 
that work. Denis MacShane now stands charged with a criminal offence and
has the right to a fair trial.’

In a statement, MacShane said: ‘I am disappointed at the CPS decision 
but as the matter is now in the hands of the court, I will be making no 
further statement.’

Denis MacShane was born in Glasgow in 1948 and was educated at the independent St Benedict's School, in Ealing, before reading history at Merton College, Oxford.

He worked for the BBC from 1969 to 1977.

He was policy director of the International Metal Workers' Federation from 1980 to 1992.

He served as an MP for Rotherham from 1994 until his resignation last year.

During this time he served under the Labour Government, including a period as Minister for Europe from 2002 until 2005.
