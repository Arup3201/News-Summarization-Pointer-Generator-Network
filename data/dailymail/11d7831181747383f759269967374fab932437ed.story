Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said police should not be left to decide what is acceptable free speech

Britain could be pushed towards a 'police state' in which officers are turned into Orwellian 'thought police' in the battle against extremism, one of the country's top cops has warned.

Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said police should not be left to decide what is acceptable free speech as the threat of severe terrorist attack intensifies.

Instead politicians, academics and others in civil society should have to decide when radical Islam veers into extremism and when anti-gay or anti-women's rights sentiments cross the line.

The vice-chair of the police's terrorism committee warned that unless this happened, it would be decided by 'securocrats' including the security service and police chiefs.

'If these issues [defining extremism] are left to securocrats then there is a danger of a drift to a police state,' he told The Guardian.

'I am a securocrat, it's people like me, in the security services, people with a narrow responsibility for counter-terrorism. It is better for that to be defined by wider society and not securocrats.

'There is a danger of us being turned into a thought police. This securocrat says we do not want to be in the space of policing thought or police defining what is extremism.'

He called on universities and colleges to improve the way they identify extremist speakers on campuses to prevent vulnerable girls leaving the country to become Jihadi brides.

'The police service does not want to be in school or on university campuses controlling thought,' he said.

'But the best way to avoid this is for such institutions to have procedures to know the messages which are being promoted and for student bodies to have policies on whether preaching hatred towards homosexuality, allowing segregated meetings or advocating violent action overseas is acceptable or not.' 

This comes as police were accused of misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists' phone records in a damning report by MPs.

Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee claim 'lamentably' poor records were kept of those who were targeted using the snooping legislation – making the process appear 'secretive and disorganised'.

They said using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) to unmask whistleblowers who help reporters made it 'not fit for purpose'.

Police and the security sources obtained communications records under the controversial legislation at a rate of about 10,000 a week.

Sir Peter gave the example of a protest earlier this year outside a shop selling Israeli products in Manchester, which attracted both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators.

'It is better for others in society to have that debate and not to have public order commanders decide that on the street, outside a shop,' he said.
