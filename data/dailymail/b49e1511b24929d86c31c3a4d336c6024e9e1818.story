Her little boy had a temperature, was sensitive to light and so poorly he couldn’t even get out of bed.

With the GP surgery shut for the weekend, Georgina Houghton-Small rang NHS Direct, who said it could be meningitis and told her to take seven-year-old Colby to hospital as fast as she could.

Mercifully, Colby was diagnosed with a viral infection and sent home with antibiotics.

Colby Houghton's mother was told by NHS Direct to take him to A&E with suspected meningitis. The family received a stinging letter from the local medical centre a few days later, accusing them of wasting NHS time

But Mrs Houghton-Small’s relief 
turned to outrage a few days later when a letter arrived from the GP 
addressed to Colby – admonishing him for going to A&E instead of the
surgery.

The practice said it had received a 
letter from the hospital about his visit, and continued: ‘A&E is for
life-threatening situations such as a heart attack or stroke and for 
the care of people who show the symptoms of serious illness or who are 
badly injured.’

A furious Mrs Houghton-Small condemned the surgery yesterday, saying its attitude could put lives at risk.

‘I was so angry that they would make 
us feel that we were wrong to seek medical advice over something like 
that,’ said the 33-year-old mother of four.

‘The letter said A&E is only for 
people with serious symptoms. How much more serious does it need to be 
for a child of seven?

‘This sort of thing needs to be 
stopped. It could put people off taking their children to hospital when 
they are seriously ill.’

Colby developed a temperature at his 
home in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, on November 9. The next day he started 
vomiting. By the third day he was too lethargic to walk or stand and was
highly sensitive to light.

Colby's parents rushed him to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage on the instructions of NHS Direct. Doctors there established he had a viral infection and sent him home with antibiotics

His parents tried giving him fluids 
and Calpol but eventually rang NHS Direct. Their local GP surgery was 
closed as it was the weekend.

‘He always has the energy to get up 
and play, but he didn’t get out of bed and all he wanted to do was 
sleep,’ Mrs Houghton-Small said.

‘We were really worried. If a kid is so ill they don’t want to watch TV or play with their toys, you know something is wrong.

‘NHS Direct said get him to A&E 
immediately and take another adult in case he takes a turn for the worse
on the way so someone is free to call 999 as the other drives. That 
scared us even more.’

She and her husband Gavin, 34, dashed
over to Lister Hospital in Stevenage. Staff there said he had a viral 
infection and prescribed antibiotics. A GP visited Colby the next day, 
and he soon recovered.

But on November 17 he received the 
admonishing letter from his surgery, the Arlesey Medical Centre. 
Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group, which is responsible  for 55 
GP practices, yesterday said the surgery had not realised NHS Direct had
given advice.

A spokesman added: ‘It’s current 
practice for some GP surgeries to write to their patients advising them 
of the importance of using their A&E departments for emergencies 
only and to promote the use of their GP service or the local 
out-of-hours GP service for non-emergencies.

‘We very much regret if the letter 
caused distress but it was intended to help the family make the right 
choice about the service they need to ensure they receive the best 
possible health care in the future.’
