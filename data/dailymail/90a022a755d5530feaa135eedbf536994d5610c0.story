Newcastle United Supporters Trust are to raise concerns over Mike Ashley’s dual interest in the English Premier League club and Rangers with government sports minister Maria Miller.

The supporters group will write to the Minister for Culture, Media and Sport and ask local politicians to raise the matter in the House of Commons.

They will also lobby the English FA, Premier League and Football League over fears Newcastle or Rangers could potentially be excluded from European competition for a season under UEFA regulations.

Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United and also has a stake in Scottish giants Rangers

The SFA have already charged Ashley with breaches of their rules on dual ownership, with a hearing due to commence on January 27.

And Newcastle’s supporters trust believe their owner is in further danger of breaching article three of UEFA regulations on the integrity of competitions.

Those ban any club participating in a European competition from having any influence ‘either directly or indirectly... in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition’.

Suspected of having pushed for the appointment of Derek Llambias as Rangers chief executive at Ibrox, Ashley has yet to respond to the challenge to his powerbase by former director Dave King and a second group of supporters, the so-called ‘Three Bears’, who have separately purchased blocks of shares representing 31 per cent of the club.

But Michael Martin of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust declared the latest front in a long-running war of attrition with the man blamed for Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Leicester by telling Sportsmail: ‘UEFA’s article three, regarding the integrity of the competitions, is clear cut.

‘Read through that and you see that the rules definitely catch Ashley out.

‘He owns 100 per cent of Newcastle United and just under 10 per cent of Rangers.

‘And he has the merchandising operation, is a major creditor and has tried to tie up various naming rights deals.

‘I don’t think anyone would argue that Llambias is also his appointment as chief executive at Rangers and has arranged for two directors to be removed from the board.

‘So we don’t think any reasonable person can dispute that he has a substantial interest in Rangers.

‘As a consequence of that he has dual interests in two clubs and once Rangers recover from their current situation and get back to where a club of their status should be they will definitely be competing in European competition.

‘And the likelihood is that would be in the Europa League to begin with where they might meet Newcastle because Ashley can’t compete with Manchester City, Chelsea or others.

‘Because of that we have drafted letters to the Secretary of State for sport, the Premier League, the Football Association and the Football League. Those will be going out next week.

‘We will also be approaching some local MPs we have good relations with and we will be asking them to raise this issue with the secretary of state for sport in the House of Commons.

‘If we don’t get anything from that we will then write to the sponsors of these competitions asking if they are aware that what they are buying is being sullied by the fact either Newcastle or Rangers won’t be able to compete.

‘The product of footballing being a sporting enterprise is being potentially sullied by Ashley’s dual interests. The SFA had led the way on this and we await their judgment later this month with some interest.’

Newcastle United have denied any potential future breach of UEFA rules on dual ownership, banning a newspaper which put the specific concerns to Europe’s governing body in September.
