Garden feud: Joan Rowe, 74, destroyed her neighbours' trees and shrubs during a six year battle over who owned a path, a court heard

The greenery hanging over a path at the bottom of her neighbours’ garden made Joan Rowe see red.

So the 74-year-old, who claimed  the 3ft-wide strip of land was part of her property, decided on direct action.

She went on a three-month hacking 
spree with an electric saw and shears, chopping down plants in the 
middle of the night and hacking at an apple tree.

After trying to persuade Rowe to stop,
her long-suffering neighbours, Anthony and Sophie Cook, reported her to
police to protect what they believed was their property.

Yesterday, Rowe was ordered to end to 
her campaign after a judge backed the Cooks and placed her under an 
indefinite restraining order.

The feud began after the pensioner 
insisted the path at the bottom of the Cooks’ garden was actually part 
of her land, which adjoins it.

She claimed to have pruned trees and 
shrubs there long before 2004, when the Cooks moved next door to her 
bungalow in Rusholme, Manchester.

However, they maintained that the path was theirs and politely asked her to stop pruning and mutilating their plants and trees.

Instead, her raids on their foliage 
escalated.

In all, she made more than 12 attacks on their property 
between August and November last year, at one point even hacking down 
bamboo at 4am.

Manchester Magistrates’ Court heard she also installed CCTV cameras overlooking the path.

The Cooks claimed she shouted at them 
and deliberately played loud music while they were outside to spoil 
their enjoyment of the garden.

Rowe said she was legally entitled to 
cut the shrubs and trees because they were encroaching on the path, 
which she said was hers.

But the Cooks showed the court Land Registry documents that confirmed the path was theirs.

They told how she had damaged several plants as well as a fence. Mr Cook told the court: ‘I went through every kind of emotion.

‘I was angry, upset, I was hurt. I couldn’t believe anyone was acting in that way.’

Mrs Cook added: ‘She was very aggressive. She would never listen to us.

‘We wanted to find a resolution to the
problem, to find out why she continued to come into our garden and 
destroy it, and find a situation where we could all live peacefully 
without interference.

‘We would like her to leave us alone. We would like to live our lives privately, with a private garden.

‘We want to go into our gardens 
without fear of being shouted at, or spied on, or to have music played 
loudly, without being watched, just as any other people would do.’ Rowe 
claimed she had a letter from 2007 proving her ownership of the path, 
but she was unable to produce it in court.

Speaking of the Cooks, she said: ‘I 
did always prune the silver birch. When they came here it was a 
different ball game. I was told to get off it [the path]. I don’t want 
to talk to them.

‘I told them I’m loath to have 
anything to do with them.’ Rowe denied one charge of harassment but was 
found guilty by District Judge Khalid Qureshi.

She was given a restraining order 
preventing her from going in her neighbours’ garden or having contact 
with them.

Rowe was also ordered to remove the CCTV and was told to pay 
£500 court costs.
