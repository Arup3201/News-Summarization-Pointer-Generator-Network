QPR manager Harry Redknapp fumed at what he thought was a ‘soft’ penalty for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Eden Hazard scored from the spot to secure a 2-1 victory, after being knocked off the ball by Eduardo Vargas, as he burst into the box.

Although the Chilean was on the outside of the Chelsea forward, Redknapp described the decision as ‘harsh’.

‘Two little men shoulder to shoulder, I thought it was a harsh one,’ the QPR boss said.

‘I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty. I just thought it was soft.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp saw his battle hard but come away empty-handed

‘We worked hard today and that will be important if we are to get out of trouble.’

Jose Mourinho was less impressed with all things Chelsea. 

‘I think the man responsible for the floodlights was in the same mood as the crowd because everyone was sleeping,’ the Chelsea manager said. ‘He took 20 minutes to understand it was dark and it took 30 minutes for me to understand the stadium was not empty. When we scored I realised the stadium was full.

‘I am not happy because my team didn’t play well, or as well as I was expecting.’
