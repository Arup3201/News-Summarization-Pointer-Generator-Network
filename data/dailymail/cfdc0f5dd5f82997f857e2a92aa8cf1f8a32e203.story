Sir Jimmy Savile was interviewed by police over child abuse allegations in 2007 but no charges were ever brought, it has emerged.

The late TV host was questioned about an alleged indecent assault at a children's home in Staines during the 1970s, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was 'insufficient evidence' to proceed.

This is the first time it has been revealed that Savile was ever questioned by police over sexual assault allegations.

Surrey police said in a statement: 'In 2007 Surrey Police received an historic allegation of indecent assault which is alleged to have occurred at a children's home in Staines during the 1970s.

The accusations made about Jimmy Savile have left many shocked, as women have come forward to allege that they were abused by the TV star

'The allegation was investigated and an individual was interviewed under caution.

'The matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action.'

The interview is thought to have related
 to alleged sexual abuse at the now-closed Duncroft Approved School for 
Girls near Staines, Surrey, where Savile was a regular visitor.

The revelation comes ahead of a TV documentary to be broadcast on Wednesday, which appears to show the late TV star defending child molester Gary Glitter during an interview, insisting that the disgraced pop star had 'done nothing wrong'.

Women have recently gone public with accusations that Savile, who died last year aged 84, groomed girls as young as 12 by offering them sweets, cigarettes and tickets to be in the audience of his shows.

Now, in the documentary Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, the presenter appears to come to Glitter's defence, insisting the sexual predator had only watched 'dodgy' films - referring to the child pornography that was discovered on the singer's computer.

Glitter was sentenced to four months' imprisonment after being convicted of downloading over 4,000 pornographic images of children, some as young as two and three, in 1999.

In March 2006 Glitter was jailed for three years for molesting two girls, aged 11 and 12, in the Vietnamese resort town of Vung Tau and made to sign the sex offenders' register.

Savile allegedly says in a recorded interview that Glitter - whose real name is Paul Gadd - had only used the films for his own 'gratification' and had not tried to profit from them by selling them.

The Jim'll Fix It presenter is shown in an interview with a journalist in 2009, suggesting that Gadd was more victim than predator.

He says: 'Now Gary, all he did was to take his computer into PC World to get it repaired.

'They went into the hard drive, saw all these dodgy pictures and told the police and the police then, "Oh we've got a famous person...Oh my goodness, yeah we'll have them."

'But Gary has not sold 'em, has not tried to sell 'em, not tried to show them in public or anything like that.

'It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is of course it's up to him as a person.

'But they didn't do anything wrong but they are then demonized.

'And of course, if you ever said to that copper, what's Gary Glitter done wrong? Well nothing really.

'He's just sat at home watching these dodgy dodgy films.

'He was like that but he wasn't public with it and he didn't do anything.'

The shocking interview comes in the same programme that features accusations from women who claim they were sexually abused by the former Jim’ll Fix It star in his Rolls-Royce, at a hospital, at a school and BBC Television Centre.

One of the alleged victims claims the former Radio 1 DJ raped her in his dressing room, while another says that the television star also fondled a teenager's breast in a caravan.

An ITV1 documentary to be aired on Wednesday night also features damning contributions from BBC production staff who claim Savile’s predatory behaviour was an open secret.

One former BBC producer who saw Savile in a restaurant with a girl aged around 12 describes Top Of The Pops as his ‘happy hunting ground’.

Broadcaster and ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen admits many in the television industry ‘blocked our ears’ to claims made about Savile during his 40-year career at the BBC.

Writing in today’s Daily Mail, she says: ‘I felt Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became untouchable.

'One of the assaults had even been witnessed by the member of a television production team. So why was nothing done?’

The BBC insists its ‘well resourced’ investigation into Savile was shelved by Newsnight editor Peter Rippon for editorial reasons.

But sources at the BBC claimed it was scrapped at the ‘eleventh hour’ because executives felt ‘incredibly uncomfortable’ broadcasting allegations of Savile’s sexual misconduct.

Peter Rippon has labelled such claims as ‘malicious’ and said that the piece was not broadcast because the story could not be substantiated.

It is also claimed the report would have clashed with a glowing Christmas Day broadcast about Savile on Radio 2.

The ITV1 documentary claims some BBC producers had been aware of Savile’s behaviour as far back as the mid 1960s.

The BBC last night said it found no evidence of any misconduct by the broadcaster in relation to its conduct towards Savile.

In a statement it said: ‘The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC. No such evidence has been found.

'Whilst the BBC condemns any behaviour of the type alleged in the strongest terms, in the absence of evidence of any kind found at the BBC that corroborates the allegations that have been made, it is simply not possible for the corporation to take any further action.'

Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has claimed Sir Jimmy Savile used his charity fundraising work as a lever to prevent his private life being exposed.

Gambaccini said his former Radio 1 colleague played tabloid newspapers 'like a Stradivarius' to keep any allegations of impropriety quiet.

Gambaccini, speaking on ITV1’s Daybreak this morning, said he had been 'waiting 30 years' for such stories to come out.

He said Sir Jimmy was 'about to be exposed' by one newspaper, but to prevent its publication he gave an interview to a rival tabloid which had the effect of stopping the negative piece.

Gambaccini went on: 'On another occasion, and this cuts to the chase of the whole matter, he was called and he said "well you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville - do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?" And they backed down.'

Sir Jimmy had raised millions of pounds over the years for his pet cause, Stoke Mandeville Hospital.Gambaccini added: 'It comes out when he’s dead because Jimmy Savile had an imperial personality in show business, I’m not talking about personal life. You just didn't mess with Jim.

'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops presentation, and you just let him have his turf.

'And none of us were interested in going there because he was away from us. At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be and he had his own life.'

Members of the Jim’ll Fix It star’s family and friends have expressed their disgust that the allegations are being made when the presenter, who died on October 29 last year aged 84, is no longer around to defend himself.

Roger Foster, Sir Jimmy’s nephew, said his family was 'disgusted and disappointed' by the programme.

Mr Foster, from Goole, East Yorkshire, said he was not only concerned for Sir Jimmy’s reputation, but also for the damage the allegations could do to his charities.

'The guy hasn’t been dead for a year yet and they’re bringing these stories out. It could affect his legacy, his charity work, everything. I’m very sad and disgusted,' he said.

'I just don’t understand the motives behind this. I just think it’s very, very sad you can say these things after someone’s died and the law says you can’t defend yourself when you’re dead.'

A spokesman for ITV defended its programme, saying: 'This documentary is the result of an in-depth investigation into long-standing allegations of serious and widespread sexual misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile. Because of the very serious nature of the claims made by several interviewees in relation to this, particular care and consideration was of course given to the decision to produce and broadcast this programme.

'The programme takes full account of the fact that Sir Jimmy is not here to defend himself against these claims.'
