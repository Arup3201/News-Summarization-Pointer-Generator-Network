After years of living in the shadows of its petrol-powered cousin, the electric car could soon have its day in the sun.

The Concept_One, from Croatian-based Rimac Automobili, is called an 'electric hyper car' and produces a staggering 1,088 brake horsepower thanks to it 91kWh battery.

Only 88 versions of the model are set to be produced, with rumours hinting towards a 2015 release date, and each will cost $1million each.

It can reach 0 to 60mph in 
just 2.8 seconds. It also has the ability to reach a top speed of 190 
mph and has a range of 373 miles on a single charge.

By comparison, the world’s fastest car is the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which can go from 0 to 60mph in 2.4 seconds.

While the fourth fastest - the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo - matches the Rimac at 2.8 seconds.

Rimac said it will only produce 88 models of the electric car, and each will cost $1million.

The battery produces the superfast speeds due to four sets of electric motors, fitted above each wheel.

All four systems work independently and are capable of accelerating and decelerating hundreds of times per second -  a system Rimac calls All-Wheel Torque Vectoring (AWTV).

It was created by 24-year-old Mate Rimac from Croatia. He said: ‘We started with a blank sheet of paper. The idea was to create an exceptional supercar with a new propulsion concept.

Rimac has also been working on a cheaper electric car, called the e-M3, dubbed Green Monster  -although similarly, no price or release dates have been announced. 

It has 600 horsepower and can go from 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds.  This is compared to Nissan’s electric Leaf model, for example, that reaches 60mph in 10 seconds.

The e-M3 has a top speed of 173mph and is officially the fastest accelerating vehicle according to FIA rules.
