From Baloo in the Jungle Book to Winne The Pooh, bears have earned a reputation for being rather lazy and it appears this young cub is no exception.

This Eurasian brown bear cub appeared more than happy just to sit back and relax while the rest of his family played in Cabarceno National Park in Spain.

Even when his brothers and sisters chased each other around, the cub was content to lie down while munching on a leaf.Â 

Forget about your worries and your strife: This brown bear cub appears to have taken the lyrics from the Jungle Book's Bare Necessities to heart as he sits back and relaxes in Cabarceno National Park, Spain

Rare insight: Photographer Nicolas Reusens captured these images of a family of European Brown Bears in Cabarceno Natural Park in Spain

This rare collection of images of the brown bear family was captured by Nicolas Reusens as he took a tour around the nature reserve.

The mother bear can be seen with at least four young cubs who will remain by her side until they reach four-years-old and are large enough to fend for themselves

But while they may look incredibly cute now, the cubs will weigh up to 635kg when they are fully grown.
