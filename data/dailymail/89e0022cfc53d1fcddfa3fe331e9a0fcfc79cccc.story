Every day in Britain, two people die waiting for a donor organ - and some experts believe this tragic situation needs a radical solution.

Currently you have to join a register if you wish to be an organ donor, an 'opt in' system. But even if a person is on the register, some bereaved families still refuse to give permission.

But from December 1 next year, Wales is changing to an 'opt out' system, where doctors will presume people have agreed to donate their organs after death, unless they have registered an objection and specifically chosen to opt out. Opt out, or 'presumed consent' systems can either be 'hard' - where the wishes of close relatives aren't considered, as in Austria, or 'soft' - where families can refuse organ donation if they think the person wouldn't have approved, as in Spain.

England has no plans to follow Wales's lead. Here Caroline Scott talks to two people affected by the issue.

Carla Gair had cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle

NO says Carla, although she could die waiting for a new heart

Carla Gair, 38, is waiting for a donor heart. She's divorced and lives in Southampton with her children Mai chi, 13, and Tylan, ten. She was a hairdresser before she became ill.

My heart consultant told me in February that I won't be here in two to three years' time without a new heart. I've since had the most devastating conversations with my daughter. She says: 'Mummy, who's going to look after me when you die?'

I just say: 'I can't promise you 100 per cent they'll find me a new heart in time, but we're 100 per cent hopeful they will.'

I can't lie to my children. They already know so much: they know I have cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that means eventually it won't be able to pump blood round my body. They know I've almost died once - I collapsed, and my heart had to be shocked back into a normal rhythm.

You can't pull the wool over children's eyes. All three of us have cried together.

Until eight years ago, I was fit and healthy. I danced, sang in a pop choir, had great friends, two wonderful children and loved my job. Then, in March 2007, I went to a nightclub with a couple of friends and collapsed on the dance floor.

I was in intensive care for ten days and in hospital for seven weeks. I was fitted with an internal defibrillator, which shocks my heart back into a normal rhythm if it starts racing too fast, and everything seemed well. But one morning in spring 2012, I suddenly felt so ill - clammy, sick and shaky.

I saw my heart consultant and I'll never forget his words: 'I think we should get you on the transplant list.'

Since then I've had four calls from the hospital, with a possible donor heart. On each occasion, the organ was either diseased or not a good match.

The last call was just last week. The ambulance arrived for me within an hour and I was prepped for surgery, but at the last minute they decided the heart wasn't a good enough tissue match. I rarely cry but it hit me a few days later and then the floodgates opened because I don't know how long I have left.

I'm only 5ft 1in and my chest cavity is small, so if the tissue type was the right match, technically, I could take a child's heart if a small adult heart wasn't available.

It's horrible and devastating even to say those words. And the only way I could take a child's heart - or anyone's heart - is if I felt the family would get a smidgen of comfort from knowing they had given me more time.

That's why, even though I am desperate to go on living for my children, I think donation has to be a gift - a personal choice - rather than an obligation. I don't want anyone to feel their loved one's heart was 'taken'.

What if someone meant to opt out but didn't get around to it, so I got that heart against their wishes? For me, that really matters.

Carla Gair is chronically ill and is waiting for a heart transplant

In Wales the system will be 'soft', so families have a clear right of objection. But they are already dealing with the worst thing to happen to them, and the bedside of a dying relative is no place to have this conversation.

I would be haunted for ever by that family's feelings. But if my donor had signed up to the donor register or expressed a wish to donate their organs, my conscience would be clear.

To join the NHS organ donor register, go to organdonation.nhs.uk or call 0300 123 23 23.

And don't forget to tell your family of your wishes.

Most importantly, I don't think presumed consent will result in more organs becoming available. If relatives haven't had the conversation beforehand, then in the horror of the moment they will simply say no, as they do now.

For me, it would be better to focus on raising awareness so more people choose to join the register. Death is still such a taboo subject and not enough people know the facts about organ donation to make an informed decision. I've met people who feel even talking about it is somehow tempting fate.

Registering as a donor won't make you more likely to die, but it might help someone after you're gone.

I think about death every day, but I still don't feel comfortable with the idea of an opt-out donor register.

Tor was diagnosed with cystic fybrosis

YES says Tor, who owes her life to a double lung transplant

Tor Tremlett, 27, runs cake makers Scrumdiddlyumptious from her home in Romford, Essex, where she lives with her parents. She had a double lung transplant on October 10, 2011.

When I was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis I was just two-and-a-half. The condition causes a build-up of sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system, which has to be dislodged with daily physiotherapy and exercises.

It dominated my childhood - Mum was told I'd probably die in my early 20s. When I was 16 my lung function began to seriously deteriorate; by the time I was 20 I couldn't move or even talk without getting breathless.

At that point, I was put on the transplant list. I waited four years for donor lungs, and I can't describe how hard it was getting through every day. My back and chest felt broken from the effort of trying to breathe and I was virtually housebound.

My friends were going to university and travelling, and all I could do was watch - not knowing if I'd survive the next few months.

I was on a lot of morphine, and breathing with a machine. I was fed via a naso-gastric tube, and Mum had to do everything - from washing to dressing me.

One day a doctor asked: 'Have you thought what you'd like to happen if you don't get a call?' She meant I needed to think about where I wanted to die.

In September 2011, the doctors told Mum it was unlikely I'd make it to Christmas. Then, on October 10, I woke up to the sound of the phone ringing.

There were some donor lungs, and the genetic match was as close as it could be. I went down for surgery at 4pm and came round the next evening.

It took a while for me to breathe on my own, and I was terrified. But I remember looking at my nails and realising they were pink instead of blue for the first time, because oxygen was circulating properly. The transplant coordinator told me my lungs came from a young man. I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd been like and what his family was going through at the same time my family was celebrating my chance of living.

People I've talked to have the most bizarre reasons for not being a donor. Some fear that doctors won't fight hard enough to save their life, or that their organs might be taken before they're dead.

But more often, people just haven't got around to it. So we miss a huge number who'd happily consent to give their organs - and that's why I think an opt-out system would be better.

But presumed consent isn't a quick fix. There'll need to be more doctors, more beds, more transplant coordinators and more retrieval teams.

And there has to be a more open discussion so people are aware they can opt out.

You can sign up for an NHS donor card

If even one more person gets their transplant as a result, I would rather have that one person saved. I have lots of friends who died waiting due to the lack of suitable donors.

Every year, on the anniversary of my donor's death, I write to his family through the coordinator. Sometimes I tell them something I've done, but usually it's just: 'I'm so grateful and I'm thinking about you.'

I never receive a reply - and I don't expect one. But I hope the family gets some comfort from the fact I'm able to keep going because of something my donor did.

I feel a responsibility to live my life not just for myself but for him - and for my friends who died waiting.
