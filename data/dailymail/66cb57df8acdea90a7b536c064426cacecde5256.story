Australian astronomers have found a star 13.7 billion-years-old - the oldest ever to be discovered in our universe.

The stellar body is thought to have formed from the materials left when the universe's first stars began exploding.

The discovery could help to resolve long-standing differences between observations and theories about the Big Bang billions of years ago.

Scientists believe the Big Bang gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen, helium, and a trace.

All the other elements that we see today were forged in
stars, which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae — huge
stars that explode at the end of their life.

This endless recycling process has yielded an intriguing
tool for astrophysicists.

One way of determining stellar age is iron, whose content in
a star enriches with every successive birth.

The lower the iron content in a star's light spectrum, the
older it is.

‘The iron level of the universe increases with time as
successive generations of stars form and die,’ said Dr Keller.

‘We can use the iron abundance of a star as a qualitative
“clock” telling us when the star was formed.

According to the researchers, the ancient star is about 6,000 light years from Earth - relatively close in astronomical terms.

After 11 years of searching, the star was discovered using the SkyMapper telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran in northern New South Wales.

The telescope is being used to search for ancient stars as part of a project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky.

‘This star was formed shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,’ said Dr Stefan Keller, lead researcher at the Australian National University Research School.

‘It's giving us insight into our fundamental place in the universe. What we're seeing is the origin of where all the material around us that we need to survive came from.’

The Big Bang was the inception of the universe, he said, and gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen, helium, and a trace.

All the other elements that we see today were forged in stars, which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae - huge stars that explode at the end of their life.

‘The iron level of the universe increases with time as successive generations of stars form and die,’ said Dr Keller.

‘We can use the iron abundance of a star as a qualitative “clock” telling us when the star was formed.

‘In the case of the star we have announced, the amount of iron present is less than one millionth that of the sun and a factor of at least 60 times less than any other known star.’

It was one of 60 million stars photographed by SkyMapper in its first year.

This is the first time researchers have unambiguously been able to say they have identified  material from the first generation of stars.

‘We're now going to be able to put that piece of the jigsaw puzzle in its right place,’ said Dr Keller.

Dr Keller said it was previously thought primordial stars died in extremely violent explosions that polluted huge volumes of space with iron.

But the ancient star shows signs of pollution with lighter elements such as carbon and magnesium - with no sign of iron.

The lack of iron changes our understanding of the early universe.

In current Big Bang modelling, those first-generation stars should have discarded iron as well as other elements – and that should be observed in a second-generation star.

This discovery suggests another process could be at work. Dr Keller suggests these first stars have these smaller explosions, and subsequent generations have more energetic explosions.Because the first generation stars had weaker explosions, they ended up consuming all their iron.

Previous sweeps of the sky have turned up four other stars with similar very low iron content, which suggests that these kinds of supernovae played a vital role in creating stars, and then galaxies, in the early universe.

‘A star is like an onion - it has all these layers and the heaviest material like iron is right down in the core.

‘The only thing to come out of it was the carbon and a little bit of magnesium from that supernova and that's what we're seeing today in the star that we've discovered.’

Previous contenders for the title of oldest star are around 13.2 billion years old—two objects described by European and U.S. teams respectively in 2007 and 2013.
