This is the adorable moment a brown bear cub relieved himself of an itch by using his mother as a scratching post.

The six-month-old was captured rubbing his back against the larger bear's body at Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in Alaska.

Just minutes earlier, he had been rolling around, dancing and wrestling with his brother.

The family's intimate interactions were captured by U.S. nature photographer D. Robert Franz.

'What we see in these photographs is the interaction between the mother brown bear and her two cubs,' said the 56-year-old.Â 

'The cubs play hard until they are exhausted and the mother keeps watch to protect them from danger.

'They are to me the symbol of true 
wilderness and one of my favourite species and it is a privilege to get a
 glimpse into their world.'

Mr
 Franz, from Cody, Wyoming, said living just outside Yellostone National
 Park meant he had been able to spend 'a lot of time' watching and photographing the bears.

Standing about 82 feet away from the cubs, he watched as they danced, wrestled and played games with each other, before capturing the intimate moments.

'The reaction to my photographs has 
been great, and most people seem to focus on how cute the cubs are and 
the interaction between them all,' said the photographer.

'I really feel that giving these species the space to live is vital. I
 see a real lack of understanding of wildlife behaviour from most 
people. I'm sure this is due to our increasingly urban society.

'This leads to people acting stupidly around wildlife which can be dangerous to them and to the wildlife.'

Cubs remain with their mother from two to four years, during which time, they learn important survival techniques.

Mr Franz said he did not fear getting so close to the bears - but added: 'I do realise that they can be very dangerous.'
