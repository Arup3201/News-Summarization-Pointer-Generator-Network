He overrode the wishes of householders to build a £100million golf course by their homes.

But it seems even Donald Trump cannot defeat Mother Nature.

The US billionaire’s controversial Aberdeenshire course, Trump International Golf Links – Scotland, was battered by North Sea storms last month, causing a large chunk of pathway to fall away.

The collapsed path, near the fourth tee, had been covered in neatly trimmed turf but now lies exposed to the elements with pipes running out of the ground.

The area of collapsed path is around 5ft deep and 15ft wide. Mr Trump’s spokesman confirmed the damage, explaining a burn had overflowed because of  the heavy rainfall.

However, the spokesman claimed to be ‘very pleased with how the course endured such an extreme weather situation’.

Last night, Suzanne Kelly, a local resident who discovered the damage, said it was ‘beautifully ironic’.

She added: ‘The amount I know about golf would fit into a teaspoon. However, I do know when I’m walking on a pathway and come to a big chasm, that’s not the best.

‘I’m just glad the light hadn’t gone by the time I got to that point on the course otherwise I’d be talking from a hospital bed with a broken leg.

‘There’s no fence, no sign, no warning you’re about to fall into a hole, just a few traffic cones.’

The 51-year-old secretary, a volunteer at community website Aberdeen Voice, continued: ‘I know there are all sorts of drainage issues across the site and it certainly doesn’t look like a bang-up job of drainage construction to me.’

Mr Trump’s spokesman claimed the pipes were simply for ‘diverting surface water’.

The golf course, which opened last July, has been beset by controversy.

US Apprentice star Mr Trump has been accused of bullying local people into accepting his plans. Last October, You’ve Been Trumped, a documentary by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter chronicling the tycoon’s battle against residents, was shown on BBC 2.

Last month, severe weather battered the East Coast, as a ‘perfect storm’ caused extensive damage. An unusual combination of tidal forces, strong winds and atmospheric pressure led to huge waves and high tides.

Mr Trump’s spokesman said: ‘The burn that runs through that part of the course was overrun with water and caused some damage. It’s easy to correct and we’ll certainly be prepared now.

‘When you have any kind of links course, occasionally you have devastating storms. I think we can all agree that the storms that hit the North-East three weeks ago were unprecedented situations of extreme volumes of water.

‘The course held up very well. There was some surface damage but actually we were very pleased with how the course endured such an extreme weather situation. There are two sections impacted because the burn burst its banks.

‘We have a 600-acre golf course which is sand-based and we have exceptional drainage. The pathway has collapsed into the burn.’
