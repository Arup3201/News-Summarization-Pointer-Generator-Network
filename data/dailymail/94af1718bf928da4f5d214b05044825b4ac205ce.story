The horrifying brutality with which an eight-year-old girl was raped and murdered has been laid bare as graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to a packed courtroom.

Tori Stafford may still have been alive as she was being stamped on and beaten with a hammer before her corpse was stuffed into plastic bags and buried beneath a pile of rocks, jurors heard.

But perhaps most haunting of all, was what she was wearing when her decomposed body was found 103 days later - just a Hannah Montana t-shirt with the words: 'A girl can dream.'

When Victoria Stafford was abducted, it was the first day she had been allowed to walk home from school on her own and it was for that reason she was singled out by Terry-Lynne McClintic and Michael Rafferty

Jurors wept and the little girl's father ran out as the court viewed the pictures, some of which were so horrifying that the judge banned even the reporting of their content.

The blonde and blue-eyed High School Musical fan went missing on her way home from school in 
Woodstock, Ontario, on April 8, 2009, sparking a hunt for the little girl that would last for three months.

Local drug addicts Michael Rafferty, 31, and Terri-Lynne McClintic, 21, were arrested a month later and charged with her murder.

In April 2010, McClintic pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life, while Rafferty denied all charges.

Before showing the pictures, Ontario state pathologist Dr. Michael Pollanen warned jurors at Rafferty's trial: 'While you might recognize 
some of the body, you might not recognize all of it.'

He went on to tell how the bottom half of Tori's body was so decomposed by the time she was found that it was impossible to tell if she had been raped or not.

But he did tell the court what was clear was that she had been stamped on, strangled and beaten with a hammer.

Trial: Michael Rafferty, 31, has pleaded not guilty to murder, sexual assault and abduction

He said 16 of her 24 ribs were broken and her liver was lacerated in injuries consistent with blunt trauma such as stamping.

He said there were 'so many fractured to the skull' that it was difficult to see where one ended and another began.

He told the courtroom, which included Tori's parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, that of four areas of her head that had been smashed, three were from a hammer's claw and one with its blunt end.

He said that various fractures to her face could have been the result of kicking, stomping or blows from a hammer.

In the end, Tori died due to bleeding from the head wounds, brain 
damage and asphyxiation, he said. It is not clear know how long she was alive 
after she was kicked and stomped.

Rafferty, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, 
sexual assault causing bodily harm and abduction, appeared unmoved by what the court heard. He sat in the prisoner’s box with his eyes either half
closed or looking up at the ceiling.

And in a further move that caused huge offence, Rafferty wore a new purple shirt and grey and purple tie - Tori's favourite colour and the colour that has become the emblem of her family throughout the trial.

Tori's body was found in woods adjoining a farmer’s field stuffed in plastic bags and buried under a pile of rocks.

Previously, Rafferty's girlfriend, McClintic, told the court how she and Rafferty singled out the little girl because she was on her own - the first day she was allowed to walk back from school alone - and lured her to the car by saying they had a schitzu puppy.

McClintic was high on Oxycontin, as she was most days, and had also smoked marijuana.

Happy child: Victoria Stafford loved Hannah Montana and was looking forward to going home that day so she could play in her newly decorated room and watch High School Musical

Parents: Rodney Stafford, father of slain

The drug-addicted couple made three stops, she said, to pick up Percocet, a highly-addictive narcotic pain killer, coffee and a hammer and garbage bags before arriving at the remote area chosen to kill the innocent school girl.

McClintic said she 'knew what was about to happen', so walked away from the car. When pressed as to what that was, she replied: 'I believed he was going to rape her.'

After Rafferty sexually assaulted Tori the first time in the front seat of his Honda Civic, during which time she could hear screams and cries for help, he called McClintic to take her to the toilet, she told the court.

Disturbing case: Victoria 'Tori' Stafford was only eight-years-old when she was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by a couple who were high on drugs

The 21-year-old recalled Tori was bleeding and crying and pleaded with her: 'Just don't let him do it to me again.'

'I told her I was sorry and that she was a very strong girl. And she said "Like you?" And I told her she was much stronger', she testified. The convicted child killer then took Tori back to Rafferty, so he could commit the senseless, depraved act again.

Rafferty's former girlfriend told the 
packed courtroom that as they were walking back to the car, Tori 
wouldn't let go of her hand. All she was wearing was her favourite 
Hannah Montana T-shirt.

'She asked me to stay with her. I tried to hold on to her hand but I 
couldn’t stay because I knew what was going to happen,' said the former drug addict. 'I couldn’t be there for that. I left.'

Testimony: Terri-Lynne McClintic, then 18, pleaded guilty to the murder of Victoria Stafford and is the key witness in the murder trial of Michael Rafferty, her ex-boyfriend and co-accused

'I kept having flashbacks. Sometimes 
it was like I wasn’t even there,' she said. 'I realized I needed to do 
something so I turned back to the vehicle and . . . when I saw what was 
going on, all I saw was myself when I was that age and all the anger and
hate and rage that I’d had and blame that I still feel towards myself 
came boiling up out of me.'

She
walked back to the car, put a garbage bag over Tori's head and started 
to kick her. She then struck her repeatedly with both sides of the 
hammer on the head, she told the court.

I went back to the vehicle and I savagely murdered that little girl,' she said to a stunned and horrified courtroom.

They both buried the body, she recounted, before washing themselves and the car so no evidence could be found.

The pair had been dating just over a 
month when they carried out the gruesome crime. McClintic said it was 
Rafferty's idea and said they would be like Bonnie and Clyde.

The trial continues.
