Thanks to a well-documented tanning obsession, Patricia Krentcil's skin is famously orange-tinged.

But the mother of five's face might take on a different shade when she catches sight of these pictures - blushing red.

The 44-year-old was kicked off the stage during an alcohol-fuelled appearance at a New York drag show, where witnesses claim she shouted expletives at the audience, kicked over her wine glass, and even tried to 'attack' the drag queen hosting the event.

Witnesses at Manhattan's XL Club said
Krentcil, of New Jersey, was so inebriated she fell over on the red 
carpet after turning up for her headline slot at the 'Tan Mom at Hot 
Mess' event.

The tanning 
addict was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after being 
accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter to a tanning booth.

The girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on her skin.

Krentcil denied taking her daughter to a tanning booth and said the child was burned by the sun while she played outside.

Jokes aimed at the mother at the comedy event - which was billed as a 'roast' of the internet celebrity - evidently failed to amuse, as she began shouting at the audience, sending staff scrambling to get her off the stage.

'She showed up for the red carpet and fell over,' one witness told the New York Post.

'She then got up and tried to attack the drag queen.'

Krentcil, who is holding a large glass 
of wine in photographs from the event, was said to be incoherent as the 
'mistress' of ceremonies tried to keep her focused.

Aftermath: A member of staff is left to mop up the mess left behind after Patricia Krentcil's curtailed appearance in New York

Bianca del Rio, one of the hosts at the club, said: 'We asked her what she wanted to drink and she slurred: "I didn't put my kids in a tanning bed!"'

She said staff had planned ahead in case things went awry during Krentcil's appearance.

'We came up with a code word earlier. It was "Christmas",' she said.

'After about five minutes, we were just screaming "Christmas", and security came and took her out.'
