Robin van Persie is determined to play for Holland at the 2018 World Cup and intends to carry on until the age of 40.

The Manchester United striker scored four goals to help his country to third place at this summer's World Cup in Brazil and has already set his sights on the next one in Russia, when he will be 35.

And thinking beyond that, Van Persie is keen to stretch his playing career for as long as possible despite suffering various injury problems over the years.

Back in action: Van Persie was given an extended break after the World Cup this summer but is back playing for Manchester United at the beginning of the Louis van Gaal era

Speaking about the next World Cup to Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, Van Persie said: 'I will be 35 then and I will do everything to be there.

'I live quietly, this saves a few years. My goal is to play at the highest level for as long as possible and being available for the national team is a part of that.

'I am 31 now and I have a little less than nine years to go. I won't be playing for a major club at the age of 40, although I do still want to be playing professional football at that age. That's my goal.'

Van Persie is already his national team's all-time leading goalscorer with 47 and is eight caps short of a century.

Having been given an extended break by Louis van Gaal, his former coach with Holland, after the World Cup, he has so far started two matches for Man United this season.

Van Persie has suffered a succession of injuries both with United and former club Arsenal but is confident he can continue until the age of 40.

The striker will captain the Dutch side in Guus Hiddink's first match in charge, the Euro 2016 qualifier with the Czech Republic in Prague on Tuesday night.
