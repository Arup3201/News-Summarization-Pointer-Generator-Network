Kiannah, 2, of Fairwater, Cardiff, keeps saying 'F***' after watching an episode of Peppa Pig in which one of the characters appears to say 'f****** gazelles'

Like most little girls her age, Kiannah Cox loves everything to do with Peppa Pig.

So her mother, Natalie, 30, thought there was no harm in indulging her daughter by letting her watch the cartoon each day.

But when Kiannah, two, began regularly using the F-word she was horrified to learn the tot had picked it up from her favourite Peppa DVD.

Miss Cox had bought her daughter the cartoon for Christmas, but it wasn't until Kiannah's older brother sat down to watch the DVD with her last month that she realised the youngster had copied the bad language from the television.

In the episode, named End of Term Party, Grandpa Rabbit is telling Daddy Pig about Peppa's school teacher Madame Gazelle, who used to play in a pop group.

He says the name of the rock band, which is supposed to be the 'Rocking Gazelles,' but Miss Cox claims it sounds like he is saying the 'F-ing Gazelles.'

Last night Miss Cox demanded the DVD be pulled from sale until the mistake could be rectified.

'My childminder came home from shopping with Kiannah one day and told me that had been saying 'F-ing' when she saw Peppa toys in a shop,' Miss Cox said.

'I'm a responsible parent and never swear in front of my kids, so I couldn't understand where it had come from.

'Then, a few days later my boy, Isaac, was watching Peppa with Kiannah and came running down the stairs to tell me he had heard it on her DVD.

'I was shocked. We watched it again and I was mortified.

'We realised she was just copying what she had seen on the television.'Â

Astley Baker Davies, creator of Peppa Pig, said any misunderstanding was unintentional

Miss Cox said the DVD was obviously not properly scrutinised before going on sale.

'The damage has been done,' Miss Cox, a mother-of-four, from Cardiff, added.

'I don't really care what Grandpa Rabbit is meant to be saying, to anyone who is watching it sounds like F-ing.

Peppa Pig is immensely popular with young children, with the series spawning toys, clothes, DVDs and other commodities

'It has caused me a lot of embarrassment. Kiannah can only say a handful of words, so it was all the more shocking that one of her first was the F-word.

'You don't expect language like that in a Peppa Pig DVD, it's disgusting.

'Nice things are supposed to come out of children's mouths, not that.

'I've tried not to make a big deal of it and now she knows that it is naughty. But I feel like she is being punished for something that's not her fault.

I feel bad because I gave her the DVD to watch but I've had to tell her off because of it.'

Miss Cox said that Kiannah, and her twin sister, Ebony, who suffers from cerebral palsy, were both born severely premature, at just 26 weeks, so when she decided to move them into their own bedroom just before Christmas it was a 'big deal.'

'We decided to decorate their room with everything Peppa Pig because it was a big deal them being in a bedroom,' she added.

'Now I just want it all gone, I don't want Peppa, she's got to go.' No-one from Entertainment One was available last night for comment.
