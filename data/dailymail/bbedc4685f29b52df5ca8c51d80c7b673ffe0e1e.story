An American man is accused of poisoning and trying to kill another
student while studying at Scotland’s elite St. Andrews University and is now
fighting extradition from the U.S.

Alexander Hilton, of Princeton, Massachusetts was partying
with some fellow students in March 2011 when Scottish authorities say he gave
one of them a bottle of wine laced with methanol, a deadly chemical found in anti-freeze.

According to court documents, Hilton then urged his victim
to drink the entire bottle ‘all in on go.’

The student, also American, reportedly did what he was told
and in the ensuing days experienced debilitating symptoms of dizziness and
balance problems, blurred vision, aching, wheezing, and severe headaches, and
even temporary blindness.

Hilton was arrested by American authorities last week under
the U.S. extradition treaty with the United Kingdom.

‘It's an attempted murder case…and we can't lose sight of
that," Assistant U.S. Attorney David D'Addio told the judge in a bail
hearing in which Hilton’s lawyer argued his client is mentally ill but denied
any wrongdoing.

Court documents also allege the victim, Robert Forbes of
Virginia, would have died from methanol poisoning had he not sought treatment
when he did and that now, nearly two years after the incident, Forbes still has
not fully recovered his vision.

‘In the opinion of the treating doctors,’ runs the
complaint, ‘the high levels of methanol in his blood would have resulted in death
had he not received medical attention and treatment.’

Scottish police reported finding in the course of the investigation an internet search for 'methanol mixed with ethanol' on Hilton's computer and a plastic funnel and measuring jug that Hilton had purchased.

Hilton reportedly left Scotland for the U.S. at the urging of St. Andrews authorities shortly after
the incident and attended a school in New Mexico for a year.

His attorney, Norman Zalkind, says Hilton left the school
and returned to his native Massachusetts to live with his parents once he
learned Scottish authorities were lodging charges against him.

Zalkind says Hilton made this move so that he could turn himself
into American authorities in the event of an extradition attempt.

Now that extradition is a real possibility and Hilton and
his attorney are in the process of fighting it.

While arguing for bail on behalf of his client, Zalkind told
the judge Hilton has a lifelong history of mental illness and is ‘going to get
sicker and sicker’ while he waits behind bars for an extradition hearing.

He also argued the extradition itself should be voided
because it fails to guarantee Hilton his constitutional rights as an American.

According to ABC News, Zalkind said Hilton ‘functions okay’
with the help of therapy and medication when he’s at home with his parents.

No ruling regarding bail was immediately made by the judge. An
extradition hearing is set for March 7.
