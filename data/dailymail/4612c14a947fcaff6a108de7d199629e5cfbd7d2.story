Princes William and Harry joined Charles and Camilla as they visited the Duke of Edinburgh last night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital a week ago.

The 92-year-old Duke had exploratory abdominal surgery on Friday and is described by his son as doing 'much better'.'

The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry's chauffeur-driven vehicle pulled up outside the hospital around 15 minutes after the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, so for a period of time the Duke had four members of his family with him at his hospital bedside.

Once out of hospital the Duke will spend two months convalescing but he is described as progressing well.

The Duke celebrated his 92nd birthday four days ago with a visit from the Queen and the Earl of Wessex.

Prince Charles and Camilla had been Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral.

Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke last week and said he was doing 'well' after his visit.

His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'.

The Duke had already received the good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes were fired across the UK to mark the milestone.

David Cameron took to Twitter to send a birthday message to Philip: 'Wishing the Duke of Edinburgh a very happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today.'

The Palace has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but sources said doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health check.

The Duke was then admitted to the London  Clinic ahead of Friday's pre-arranged operation on Thursday night.

The surgery, known as a laparotomy, was performed on Friday under general anaesthetic.

He was visited by the royal doctor, Professor John Cunningham, on Saturday and the results of the operation are expected later this week.

The Duke is likely to recover in hospital for the next two weeks.

It is not usual for members of the Royal Family to visit the duke in hospital, because he disliked ‘fuss’.

The duke’s latest admission is the fourth time in 18 months that he has needed hospital treatment.

In 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused to receive any well-wishers.

His eldest grandson Peter Phillips said last week that the family was kept informed but added: ‘He’s one of those people who wouldn’t want you to stop just because he’s gone into hospital.’

Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral.

He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest.
