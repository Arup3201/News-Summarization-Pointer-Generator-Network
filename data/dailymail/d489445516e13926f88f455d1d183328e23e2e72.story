An air force veteran who had to leave active duty after being blown up twice in roadside bomb attacks now captures the portraits of other veterans as a form of 'therapy'.

Stacy Pearsall, a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, suffered a devastating neck injury after being involved in IED attacks in Baghdad in February 2004 and March 2007.

Recurring neck pain forced her to leave active duty, and she risked falling into depression. 

Unforgettable: Stacy Pearsall, a retired U.S. Air Force sergeant who was forced out of active duty after being involved in two bomb attacks in Baghdad, now takes portrait photographs of fellow veterans, like the shirtless solider seen above staring at his uniform

'Therapy': Mrs Pearsall said taking pictures of other veterans was a therapeutic activity for her  

She said: 'When I left the military it was not on my terms and it was a very dark period. 

'Military service was my life. When it got taken away from me it was like having the wind taken out of my sails.'

However, Mrs Pearsall, 34, was able to stay connected to the military through her love of photography and began meeting and photographing veterans from the Second World War to the present.

Since August 2008 she has photographed more than 100 veterans of various conflicts for a series she has named 'Veterans Portraits'.

She said: 'I turned to portrait photography. I never anticipated it to be therapy but it was.'

Mrs Pearsall was just two weeks away from returning home after a tour of duty in Iraq when she was involved in the first bomb attack.   

Family bond: A veteran smiles as his daughter plans a kiss on his cheek as he balances her on his knee

Paying the cost: A veteran with a prosthetic leg stands proud and similes broadly for the camera 

Injured but not defeated: A disabled veteran looks lost in thought as he sits in his wheelchair 

Playing around: A former pilot gestures with a model airplane while resting on a chair; Mrs Pearsall said soldiers often opened up to her about their wartime experiences while having their pictures taken 

Good on ya: A veteran winks at the photographer as he has a close-up picture taken of his face

She said: 'I walked away from the explosion and didn't realise how badly I was injured. I didn't know it at the time, but when I was hit I seriously injured my neck and sustained brain trauma.'

Having returned home, she was cooking dinner when she realised just how seriously she had been hurt.

 She said:' The world flipped upside down. I fell to the floor, and had no idea what was going on.'

Despite being diagnosed with vertigo, she was still deemed fit enough to return to Baghdad in 2007 where she again had a narrow escape. After being involved in the second incident, Mrs Pearsall was forced to retire in 2008. 

In August that year her medical care was transferred to a Veterans' Administration Hospital where she began meeting other veterans and exchanging stories. 

At first, veterans thought she must have been there to visit a relative.   

What a character: A veteran with a walking frame, wore sunglasses and a cap to have his picture taken

Proud: An injured soldier, quietly poses for his picture; Mrs Pearsall approached organisations, including The Veterans' Health Administration, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the United Services Automobile Association to fund her portrait project

Way back when: A veteran holds a small photo of him taking during his time in the service

She said: 'I got to know a World War Two veteran. He leaned over and asked if I was there to support my grandfather. He was surprised when I told him I was actually the veteran. We soon began trading stories.

'This encounter made me realise a lot of people have a specific idea of what a veteran should look like - but despite the physical differences between me and him we shared many of the same experiences.'

Mrs Pearsall then approached organisations, including The Veterans' Health Administration, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the United Services Automobile Association to fund her portrait project.

Mrs Pearsall, of Goose Creek, South Carolina, said while having their picture taken, veterans often opened-up about their experiences. 

She recalled: 'A Vietnam veteran once came in for a portrait and told me his job was to identify bodies which were mutilated beyond recognition. War creates horror beyond comprehension.

'I hadn't noticed at the time but as he told me this his wife was in the corner of the room, crying. Afterwards she hugged me and told me she had lived with him for decades but had never been told about his experiences in the war.

'Why he chose to talk about it at that specific point in time I will never know. I just listened.'

Mrs Pearsall continues to travel around America, photographing her fellow veterans.
