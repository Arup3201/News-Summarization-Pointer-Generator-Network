Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the 23,000-strong Magistrates' Association in England and Wales, said courts were being closed and staff numbers were being 'decimated'

A magistrates' leader has claimed the whole courts system is ‘sinking’ and has accused Ministers of being more interested in cutting costs than seeing justice.

Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the 23,000-strong Magistrates’ Association in England and Wales, said courts were being closed, staff numbers were being ‘decimated’ and JPs themselves were ‘walking away’.

Mr Monkhouse claimed magistrates had even been told by the Courts & Tribunals Service not to ‘engage’ with adult defendants to find out more about their background before passing sentence.

In an article for Independent Monitor, a magazine for prison watchdogs, he explained: ‘The thought is a five-minute conversation with an offender is going to multiply up into extra days’ sittings.’

Mr Monkhouse pointed out that colleagues in youth courts were encouraged to talk to defendants.

‘By what logic  does an offender reach the age of 18 and suddenly be excluded?’ he asked.

A magistrate for more than  a decade, Mr Monkhouse said that discussions could lead  to the disclosure of issues  such as substance abuse or homelessness.

However, courtrooms ‘increasingly are focused more towards cost  and efficiency than justice’.

Since Coalition cuts took hold, 89 magistrates courts across England and Wales have closed, along with 48 county courts used for civil cases.

Ministers believe the move will save £99million over a decade.

HM Courts & Tribunals Service denied magistrates were being prevented from talking to defendants.

A spokesman said: ‘We fully support effective judicial engagement with offenders in both youth and adult courts.

‘It is entirely a matter for the magistrates as to how a particular hearing is managed.’
