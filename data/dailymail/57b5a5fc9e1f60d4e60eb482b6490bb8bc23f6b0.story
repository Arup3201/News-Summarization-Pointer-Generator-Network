Actor Bill Roache, 81, appeared at Preston Crown Court for a preliminary hearing to fix a trial date over alleged child sex offences, which he denies

Coronation Street star Bill Roache will face trial in January over allegations of historic sexual offences against five girls.

The 81-year-old actor, who was charged in May with two counts of raping a teenage girl in 1967, appeared at Preston Crown Court today so a trial date could be set.

The actor, who has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, last week faced fresh charges of five indecent assaults involving four girls aged between 11 or 12 and 16.

He denies all the charges.

Roache appeared today for a five-minute preliminary hearing and was bailed until his next court appearance on September 2 when he will enter formal pleas.

His trial date was fixed for January 13.

Last week, Roacheâ€™s lawyer said his client was looking forward to standing before a jury to 'vigorously protest his innocence' over 'deeply upsetting' child sex allegations.

The world's longest-serving soap actor will not be appearing in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded.

Today he entered the dock in Court 10 and spoke only to confirm his full name.

He was granted conditional bail by the Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC.

The latest claims arose from the publicity over his arrest at his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, on May 1, and his subsequent charging on the same day.

The fresh charges, which relate to separate alleged victims, are said to have been committed in the Manchester area in 1965 and 1968.

Roache is on bail with various conditions including residence, no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 and not to approach named witnesses.

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which are not linked to Roache.
