Growing fears that the end of the world is nigh due to either a natural disaster, terrorism strike or even a zombie apocalypse have sparked a sharp spike in interest in survivalism.

As many as three million Americans now fall into the category dubbed 'preppers' - people who are making detailed plans for the end of the world as we know it.

As their numbers grow so too does a booming industry of organizations ready to help teach wannabe survivalists the skills that could suddenly become very necessary in the event of a major catastrophic event.

One such organization catering for the growing number of 'preppers' is the North Florida Survival Group, which claims it can teach you and your family everything you need to know to survive including how to live off the land, how to purify water and how to handle heavy duty firearms including AK-47s.

The group is the brainchild of Jim Foster, 57, a retired police officer, who claims he has experienced a significant increase in interest from the public since the horrific massacre at a school in Sandy Hook late last year.

According to the group’s website it now has over 200 members and that is growing with about one person signing up per day, says Foster.

As these photographs of a recent training exercise show, it isn’t just adult males taking part. Concerned parents are bringing along their children - such as 9-year-old Brianna - so they too can learn valuable skills such as how to fire an AK-47.

The group passionately supports the right of U.S. citizens to bear arms and on its website it states that it aims to teach ‘patriots to survive in order to protect and defend our Constitution against all enemy threats’.

‘I am an American who believes our freedoms are in jeapordy (sic),’ explains Foster on his website.

‘We want people to know that we cannot depend on our government to take care of us in a catastrophy (sic). In fact, if our government is intent on moving us to socialism, they may even cause the catastrophy! (sic).

Training is free, although members are asked to supply their own gear.

So if you fancy spending your  weekends conducting field training exercises in a tactical harness this might be the group for you. You never know when the training might come in handy.
