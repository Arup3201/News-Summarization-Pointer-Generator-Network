They were hardly the first couple to argue over what to watch on television on a Sunday evening.

So Irene Clark and her husband Richard were astonished when four police officers turned up at their front door.

And they were horrified when Mrs Clark, 65, was arrested and led away – because she had swiped at her husband with a magazine during their row.

Row: Irene Clark, left, spent two nights in a police cell after beating her husband James, right, with a magazine in a row over whether to watch period drama Foyle's War

The grandmother spent two nights in a police cell and now has a criminal record after a neighbour reported the ‘domestic incident’.

Yesterday Mr Clark, 52, said: ‘It was a total overreaction. I did not consider myself being a victim for getting biffed over the head with a magazine after an argument over a TV programme.’

The couple, who have been married for 14 years, had the row because Mrs Clark wanted to watch period detective drama Foyle’s War, starring Michael Kitchen, on ITV1.

‘Richard wanted to see some plane programme. We were arguing,’ she said. ‘There was a Sunday magazine on the edge of the chair and it was like a swipe on the top of the head. [The magazine] was open.

‘It wasn’t even folded. ‘We started watching Foyle’s War. I was in my dressing gown.

‘The next thing we heard was bang, bang, bang at the door.

‘Richard answered it and four police officers piled into the house. Two took him away to a bedroom and two came in with me to the living room. The policewoman said they’d had a report of a domestic incident.

‘I said, “Yes, we had an argument and I slapped him with a paper.” She said, “We’ll have to take you in now”. It was surreal. I was taken into the street and put in the van.’

Mr Clark said: ‘All I had on my forehead was a mark like I’d scratched a pimple.

‘They sent for paramedics for me and my wife was apprehended and handcuffed. It was a total overreaction.’

His wife added: ‘They said that there had been a complaint from the neighbours and they were arresting me for an assault on Richard. There was a tiny paper cut on his forehead which neither of us had noticed.’

Arrested: After a night in the cells in Cupar, pictured, near St Andrews, Mrs Clark was taken to Dunfermline and spent two nights behind bars before being 'admonished' by the courts

Because the next day was a court holiday in Scotland, Mrs Clark, a retired social worker from Tayport, Fife, spent two nights in custody.

‘I was put in a cell with just a blanket and lunatics shouting and screaming next door,’ she said. ‘I had to wait in the cells there with drug addicts and didn’t get out until 6pm.’

Mr Clark said: ‘I was very concerned for her. I phoned up continuously.’

Mrs Clark was admonished – a verbal punishment – at Dundee Sheriff Court last week after she admitted striking her husband with the magazine during the incident in July.

Her solicitor William Boyle said: ‘Either the law or those applying the law have gone mad. This politically correct madness must stop.’

A Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service spokesman said: ‘Domestic abuse is never trivial and our prosecutors take it extremely seriously.’
