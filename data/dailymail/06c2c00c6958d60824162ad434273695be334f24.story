Nevada Democrat Harry Reid's party took a beating in the November elections, and now he has the bruises to show it.

Reid, who will switch from majority leader to minority leader this weekend, broke some ribs and facial bones on Thursday while he was exercising at his home in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson.

His Senate office told reporters on Friday that he would be at work in Washington, D.C. in the coming days, following treatment at University Medical Center in Las Vegas.

'A piece of equipment Senator Reid was using to exercise broke, causing him to fall and break a number of ribs and bones in his face,' read a statement from his office.

Reid's doctors 'expect a full recovery.'

'Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene,' the statement continued.  

'Senator Reid was first brought to St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson by his security detail. He was then transferred to UMC for further testing, where he was admitted overnight as a precaution.'

'Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene. His doctors expect a full recovery,' the statement added. 

Reid is no stranger to bumps and bruises. 

He and some staffers sustained minor injuries during a chain-reaction car accident in October 2012. 

Reid walked in an out of the hospital under his own power.

And Thursday marked Reid's second exercise-related mishap in three years.

WALKING WOUNDED: Reid dislocated his shoulder and bruised his face in 2011 after he leaned on a wet car in the rain and slipped

He dislocated his shoulder and bumped his forehead in May 2011 when he slipped and fell during a morning jog in the rain.

Reid leaned on a wet car near his home in Washington, D.C.'s Ritz-Carlton hotel and tumbled to the ground.

That fall left him with a contusion just below his left eye, but he was back in action later that night at a fundraiser for California Sen. Barbara Boxer.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters on Friday in Hawaii that President Barack Obama phoned Reid earlier in the day 'to wish him a full and speedy recovery.'

'The president was glad to hear the Leader is doing well, and will be back in Washington this weekend,' Schultz's statement read.
