Among those to respond to his post was BBC sports presenter Jacqui Oatley, who used to work with Peacock and was the first female commentator on Match of the Day. She wrote 'Gav?!' 

She went on to post: 'Gav’s a really good man with strong religious views. Many will disagree, though.'

Before adding: 'Not ideal timing to be talking about female submission with the Ched Evans story ongoing.' 

In the first tweet Peacock wrote: 'Husbands: one of your primary duties in loving your wife is to feed her with the Word of God daily.' 

This was followed moments later by: 'Wives: one of the primary ways you are to respect your husband is by gladly submitting to and encouraging his leadership.'

Finally he told his 4,992 follower's: 'God's divine design for marriage in male headship and female submission is complementary not competitive.'

Talksport commentator Nigel Adderley said: 'I used to really enjoy working with Gavin Peacock on the radio but won't be implementing his views on marriage at home...'

Peacock, who has been a Christian since he was 18, abandoned his broadcasting career in 2008 to become a pastor

Comedian Josh Widdicombe tweeted: 'Oh my, Gavin Peacock is having a disaster on twitter today. Has Eddie Newton got hold of his account as part of a dressing room prank?'

Another user said: 'Remember Gavin Peacock who played for Chelsea? He's found God and he's tweeting some DELIGHTFUL things about women.'  

Peacock scored 108 goals in an 18-year professional career, before briefly working with the BBC and Chelsea's official website.

He abandoned his broadcasting career in 2008 after answering a religious calling  and is now a pastor at the at the Calvary Grace Church in Calgary, Canada. 

Amanda, his wife of 25 years, and their two children Jake, 21, and Ava ,18, also made the move. 

Peacock, who has been a Christian since he was 18, told the Express: 'I started doing some preliminary Old and New Testament studies.

'I knew then I was being called to it full-time. I call it my joyful compulsion. I love it, but I must do it.'

Peacock has been contacted by the MailOnline for comment.
