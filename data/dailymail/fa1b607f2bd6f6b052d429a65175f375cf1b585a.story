Wowsers! Harry Needs tweeted the picture of the four-time Olympic medalist in a tight blue dress

One comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin while Twitter trolls attacked her about her weight and her nose. 

Earlier this year, Miss Adlington underwent surgery to have her nose reduced and bump removed.

She told the Mail earlier this year: 'Obviously, being a swimmer, you never think you’re going to get any sort of profile, so I didn’t know what fame was. I didn’t expect it.

'The thing that I found very difficult when it all started happening after Beijing was that people were commenting on something that I just didn’t understand – on the way I look – and I thought, “What’s that got to do with swimming?” So that hit me.

‘I also thought, well I’m trying to represent my country and you should be wanting to help everyone – all the British team get behind each other.

'At first it definitely upset me. I’d burst into tears when I first started reading things but as I’ve grown up I’ve learnt to think, you know what, I don’t know them, they’ve never seen me in real life, they’ve never spoken to me.'

Miss Adlington, who marries fellow swimmer Harry Needs next month, is now carving out a successful TV career.

During her appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, she regularly broke down in tears after comparing herself unfavourably to fellow contestant model Amy Willerton.

When she was swimming Miss Adlington needed to consume up to 3,500 calories a day.

She would eat six Weetabix for breakfast, four sandwiches for lunch, a huge spaghetti bolognese in the evenings as well as constantly snacking.

However when she stopped swimming, she began to put on weight.

The former athlete lost most of the weight - about two stone - when she was on I’m A Celebrity and judging by this later photo she has lost more. 

She is now presenting the Glasgow Commonwealth Games full of confidence.

She has also appeared on the show A Question of Sport and A League Of Their Own.
