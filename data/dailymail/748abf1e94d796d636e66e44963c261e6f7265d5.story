The nail-biting rescue of a Brooklyn dog trapped on a window ledge ended in triumphant cheers from the gathered crowd below.

The whole episode, which was caught on tape, involved a Chow being saved from a second story ledge in Carroll Gardens by an FDNY communications worker.

The lucky pooch was successfully caught by emergency worker and safely returned to solid ground.

A scared dog in Brooklyn was trapped on a second story window ledge before being rescued by an FDNY worker

James Morgan, who captured the tense rescue on his camera was shocked and nervous to see the dog in peril, he told The Daily News.

Just passing by the window ledge in his Brooklyn neighborhood, Morgan originally thought the Chow was just sticking its head out the apartment window for some fresh air.

'At first, I see this dog and I’m thinking, ‘Oh, that’s cute, the dog’s getting a little fresh air,’' recalled Morgan. 'Then I noticed he had gotten through the child window barrier and couldn’t get back in,' he told The New York Post.

The rescue: A FDNY civilian worker in the area was called into to help bring the dog down from the ledge using his cherry picker

Gaining trust: The rescuer offered the dog a bowl of water, but the Chow looked back at him uninterested

New tactic: After rejecting the water, the FDNY worker offered the Chow dog treats (which he places on the window ledge here) that the pooch happily accepted

Spotting the dog in danger two stories up Morgan and a crowd of concerned locals found a FDNY worker in the area who conveniently was working in his cherry picker.

The civilian FDNY member is caught on camera trying to lure the dog into his cart with the help of suggestions from unidentified Samaritans below.

A man at the front of the crowd is heard on video giving advice to the  worker, such as 'try to pet him slowly.'

Contact: After offering dog treats the FDNY worker finally gained the Chow's trust and pictured here, pets the dog before attempting to grab it

Happy: The Chow appears to smile as the FDNY worker stroked his plush coat before grabbing him from the ledge

Leashing: At the suggestion of a Samaritan below, the emergency worker places the dog on a leash in case he tries to jump during the rescue attempt

He also told the rescue worker to leash the dog in case it tried ti jump off the 6 inch ledge.

Later the same man handed the rescue worker a dog bowl filled with water that was supplied by a nearby pet store, The Post reported.

However, the Chow seemed uninterested in the water.

Going for it: the worker grabs the dog from under neath as the Chow, at first slightly resistant, looses his footing a little on the ledge

Safe: The rescue worker successfully gets the pooch into his cherry picker and begins to lower him back to safety on the ground

It wasn't until he was offered dog treats a few minutes later that the rescuer successfully gained the canine's trust and was able to grab him off the ledge.

Though rescuers and passerby's were not sure exactly how the dog got into his precarious situation, it is believed the fluffy pooch managed to wriggle his way out onto the ledge by slipping between a small gap in the child protective railing on the window, The News reported.

Landed: The cherry picker with the dog safely in tow touches down on the pavement as the assembled crowd cheers

Morgan told NBC News that watching the situation from below it was, 'pretty nerve-wracking.'

'It looked like his paws slipped a few times, like maybe he thought he could make the jump down,' Morgan told The Post.

After a few attempts the FDNY worker was able to grab the dog and lower him down from the ledge to cheers from the assembled crowd.

Morgan told The News that the dramatic rescue was 'a real community effort.'
