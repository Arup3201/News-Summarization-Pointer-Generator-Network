Daniel Levy's massive restructuring programme at Tottenham has started with an attempt to bring in Southampton’s head of recruitment Paul Mitchell.

The Spurs chairman, furious with the team’s attitude in the club’s 2-1 defeat by Stoke at White Hart Lane on Sunday, has made it known there will be major changes of personnel in the coming weeks.

Mauricio Pochettino worked with Mitchell, very much man of the moment after his remarkable success recruiting players for Southampton, at St Mary’s last season.

Daniel Levy begins his Spurs restructuring by trying to lure Southampton's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell

Pochettino, who admitted he was under massive pressure to change the culture at the club after Sunday’s defeat, is in favour of the move for Mitchell.

The Southampton manager worked with him at St Mary’s last season and has made it known to Levy that he trusts Mitchell’s judgement of players.

Mitchell is very much the eyes and ears at Southampton and he is largely credited behind the scenes at the club for their hugely successful recruitment policy.

Southampton are second in the Barclays Premier League after an extraordinary start to the season under new coach Ronald Koeman.

They will fight to keep Mitchell, a former professional player with Wigan and MK Dons, on the south coast despite Tottenham’s advances.

Mitchell, 33, travels the world for Southampton and is credited with the majority of incoming transfers since his arrival at the club two years ago.

Levy is determined to shake up Tottenham’s backroom team and has already started to make changes following the club’s poor start to the season.

Former Spurs midfielder Steffen Freund has now been shifted to his third position at White Hart Lane in less than a year.

Freund, who was headhunted from a good job at the German football federation, was a coach under Andre Villas-Boas, but was sidelined at the start of his second season at Spurs.

He was eventually given another coaching role, but is now in the position of club ambassador after Pochettino made it known he wanted to work with his own coaching staff.

Freund was sent to China two weeks ago as part of a marketing exercise and has only just returned to London.

The existing scouting system at White Hart Lane is set to be shaken up by Levy after poor recruitment 

Levy is pressing ahead with other major changes at the club and determined to shake up their existing scouting network.

Spurs have fallen behind the top teams in Europe because they do not have enough scouting staff out on the road watching matches before statistics appear on the widely used Scout7 and WyScout computer systems.

Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal have scouts based around the world and they are identifying talent long before they appear on the computer system used by most Premier League teams.

That has given them a competitive advantage over Tottenham, but Levy is determined to put things right at White Hart Lane.
