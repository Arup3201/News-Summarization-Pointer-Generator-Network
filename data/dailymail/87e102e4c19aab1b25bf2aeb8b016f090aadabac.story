It looks like something from outer space, but the 'alien of the deep' is found much closer to home. 

With its fleshy snout, nail-like teeth and flabby pink body it wouldn't look out of place in a science fiction film, but the rare sea goblin shark described as an 'alien of the deep' has been found off Australia's southeast coast and delivered to the Australian Museum in Sydney.

The prehistoric-looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives. The shark had died by the time it was handed over, but it was still a priceless asset as only four of them have been acquired by the Sydney museum - the first two collected back in the 1980s.

'It's pretty impressive, it's not hideous it's beautiful,' said the Australian Museum's fish collection manager Mark McGrouther, who described its teeth as looking like 'little daggers'.

'They are not caught terribly often. They are not encountered terribly often at all.'

The latest was picked up by a fisherman in January. It was found near Eden, off Australia's southeast coast, at a depth of about 200 metres and delivered in excellent condition to the museum.

McGrouther said he was 'thrilled' to handle the shark, which is found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. 

The species, whose scientific name is 'Mitsukurina owstoni', is thought to be a living fossil dating back some 125 million years. 

The animal's jaw mechanism, which shoots forward when it detects prey and then retracts under its fleshy, spade-shaped snout, was what fascinated McGrouther the most.

'I suspect because it has got soft, flabby musculature, it doesn't need much energy... so it will swim slowly over the bottom just using its snout like a metal detector,' he said.

'It will be sweeping over the bottom and when it detects a small fish, or a crab or a squid it will shoot those jaws out 'wham' and capture whatever it is. 

'It will spear it with those sharp pointed teeth and then just wolf it down whole.'

The latest goblin shark specimen, from which tissue samples have been taken for genetic testing, will be preserved by the museum and made available for research.
