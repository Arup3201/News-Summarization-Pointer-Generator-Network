Deadly: Alethea Parker, 51, almost died and lost both her legs and one hand after inhaling the deadly bacteria while in Tuscany in Italy

When Alethea Parker arrived at her rented Tuscan farmhouse for a holiday with her husband and friends, it seemed the dream destination.

But, unbeknown to the holidaymakers, the house harboured a life-threatening bacteria: legionella.

Their planned happy week in Italy was to leave Alethea in intensive care for months – and cause her to lose most of her limbs.

For while, to many people, legionnaire’s disease has an almost mythical status, considered little more than scare stories about toxic water in taps, it remains a very real danger.

Although she can’t be sure, legionella thrives in water systems and it is most likely Alethea was infected whilst showering.

Just
 last week, Public Health England issued an urgent alert after a newborn
 child was admitted to intensive care with the illness, thought to have 
been contracted from a contaminated home birthing pool.

Up
 to 15 per cent of people who contract the pneumonia-type lung 
infection, caused by breathing in droplets of water contaminated with 
the aggressive bacteria, will die.

And those who survive can be left 
with lifelong disabilities, like Alethea.

Although
 cases of UK infection have dropped, those contracted abroad have 
remained steady, accounting for more than half of  the 235 instances in 
2011, when the last statistics are available.

Yet
 most of us, like Alethea, barely register the risks.

The 51-year-old 
retail manager from Farnborough, Hampshire, arrived in Italy in July 
2010 as the final destination of a two-week driving holiday around 
Europe with her husband Barry, now 66, a retired warehouse manager, and 
another couple.

But Alethea soon started feeling very unwell.

‘I
 developed a headache and became constantly thirsty. I felt lethargic 
but assumed it was lingering work stress. Then, towards the end of the 
holiday, I started being sick. We thought it was food poisoning.’

Back in Britain, her condition worsened and she began slurring her words, then fainted in the shower.

‘Barry rang our doctor. When he relayed my symptoms, they told him to call an ambulance,’ says Alethea.

When paramedics arrived, Alethea was struggling to breathe. She was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, where she was so unwell that doctors put her into an induced coma while they carried out checks.

Barry, along with Alethea’s mother, brother and two sisters, were told that she was very seriously ill with legionnaire’s disease.

‘I’d heard of it but had no idea  how serious it was,’ he says. ‘We all burst into tears as the doctor told us she could die.’

The consultant said the only treatment was an ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation) machine  at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester. This complex equipment works like an artificial lung, taking blood from the lungs, removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it, before returning it to the body.

Alethea was moved to Leicester, but things didn’t improve. ‘The doctors tried different types of antibiotics but nothing helped. Then, in the second week, her hands and feet started dying – they were shrivelling and becoming hard and locked,’ says Barry.

The drug given to keep her alive – noradrenaline, injected into her heart to reduce the size of the blood vessels so it is easier for the heart  to pump – can cause blood vessels in hands and feet to shut off.

In the second week, Alethea was taken off ECMO, transferred back to intensive care at Frimley and slowly brought out of the coma.

She says: ‘It was like a weird dream – even seeing my hands and legs in such a bad way. I kept telling Barry to explain my absence to work.’

As Alethea slowly recovered, doctors said they would need to amputate her left hand, both legs just below the knee, as they had gangrene, and some fingers on her right hand.

‘My left hand was so painful and useless that I knew I couldn’t keep it, but I was really upset as I didn’t know how I’d work again. I coped because I never dwell on things. I had to go forwards and do the best I could.’

Barry says: ‘Alethea cried for about 20 seconds then said, “Right, I’m not going to cry any more, let’s get on with it.” She had this strength of character that seemed able to deal with it and not crumble – the rest of us took strength from that.

‘Removing the legs required a four-hour operation, yet she was  still quite chirpy afterwards. When I arrived in recovery, she was having a cup of tea and said, “You do realise you’re married to someone disabled?” I said I’d always wanted a blue badge for parking.’

Alethea returned home in February 2011 for the first time since her collapse in the shower the summer before.

She is now able to drive thanks to a special handle on her car’s steering wheel and has regained her licence from the DVLA. She still visits a rehabilitation unit for maintenance on her prosthetic legs and hand but is now medically well, with no lasting problems with her organs.

‘You get used to it,’ she says. ‘It gets on my nerves needing someone with me all the time. Barry has to come on our girls’ weekends away now but I wanted life back to as normal as possible and that’s what we used to do every year.

‘I still think, “Gosh, this really has happened to me.” It feels surreal. But I’m adapting. People don’t realise how serious legionnaire’s is. When I hear about an outbreak now it sends shivers down my spine.’
