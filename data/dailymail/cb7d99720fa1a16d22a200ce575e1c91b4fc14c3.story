Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla has said he is happy to stay at Arsenal despite interest from Atletico Madrid, although he admits that 'you never know what the future will bring'.

Cazorla is enjoying one of the best periods of his career, having scored seven goals and provided eight assists in 29 Barclays Premier League appearances this season for Arsenal.

The 30-year-old Spaniard's impressive displays have seen him linked to a return to his homeland with Atletico Madrid, and Cazorla admits he has heard about interest from the Spanish capital.

But despite the possibility of a move back to his home country, Cazorla says he is happy with his life at Arsenal and with his wife and children in north London. 

'I've heard (about Atletico's interest), like everybody,' he said. 'But at the moment there is nothing concrete, only rumours. I don't worry about that.

'I'm focused on Arsenal, where I am very happy. I have another year on my contract and the option for one more.'

Cazorla signed for Arsenal in the summer of 2012 for a £16.5million transfer fee from Malaga, and he has been a key man in Arsene Wenger's squad ever since.

With speculation of summer moves to bring big stars to the Emirates Stadium inevitable, Cazorla admits it remains important for him to be a valuable player and hinted that if that was compromised he could eventually leave. 

'As long as I feel valued, I will continue here,' he told El Mundo. 'Although you never know what the future will bring in football. 

The Spaniard did say that his continuing at the club would depend on him still feeling valued by Arsenal

'I live in Hampstead, 15 minutes from the training ground, and it's really nice.

'It's the perfect place for my kids to go to school... very calm. They're picking up the language quickly, which is really important for me and my wife.'
