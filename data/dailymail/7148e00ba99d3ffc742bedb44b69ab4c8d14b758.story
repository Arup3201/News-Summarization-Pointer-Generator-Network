A female prison guard has claimed that she was sexually assaulted by 17 inmates - and that it took her bosses more than two months to call the police.

The woman, who has not been identified, was on duty in December at a Miami-Dade correctional facility in south Florida when she was cornered by a gang of men while responding to an out-of-control murder suspect.

While she was dealing with the prisoner, other inmates flooded into the enclosed areaÂ  after a cell door that should have been closed was left open.

In the prison surveillance footage, a riot breaks out among inmates at the Florida jail leaving corrections officers struggling to regain control. It was during this time that one female officer claims to have been sexually assaulted

The open house prison in south Florida erupted into violence on December 30 - but a female officer who was allegedly assaulted said that her attack was not reported to police

The prison door on the upper left of the surveillance tape screen was left open by mistake which allowed men to pass into another area where one female guard was trying to restrain a prisoner

She told NBC 6: 'I was devastated. I was traumatized. I was physically and sexually assaulted.'

In a horrifying video, prison guards can be seen struggling to get control of dozens of inmates in the open housing bay. Three other guards were also hurt in the December 30 incident.

Shortly before the situation gets out-of-control, the surveillance footage shows show several inmates slipping through an open cell door.

Off-camera, the female guard said she was on the other side of that open door, trying to get control of Derrick Harrell, 23, who was awaiting trial for murder.

In a later report, the female officer told her supervisors: 'I was pushed, punched... in my head,
 face, neck... abdomen and back; the inmates began to grab my vaginal 
area, breast, and buttocks.

'I was kicked in 
the vaginal area and groped by several inmates. While I was being 
sexually assaulted... I thought I was about to be gang raped.'

The woman, who has not been identified, said that the sexual assault had left her 'traumatized'

The female guard was 
rushed to hospital after the attack where she assumed she 
would speak to police officers as was standard practice.

She
 spent 60 days off work while recovering from the assault and when she 
returned, the woman was shocked to find that no one had taken the 
incident to police.

She threatened to call police herself if no one took action. On March 15, police were notified - 73 days after the attack took place.

Harrell was arrested the next day for battery on a law enforcement officer. He has pleaded not guilty.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the corrections department's interim director Marydell Guevara.

Derrick Harrell, 23, who was awaiting trial for murder, was also charged with battery on a law enforcement officer following the assault
