Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted that he was drinking after being caught on video on Monday night incoherently rambling in what appears to be a Jamaican accent.

In the video, immediately posted on YouTube and going viral, Ford is seen in a fast food restaurant, swearing and talking about police surveillance.

The video is titled 'New Video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Drunk, Swearing in Jamaican Patois? Bumbaclot.'

An undated video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was posted to YouTube this week where he rambles incoherently in what sounds like an imitation of Jamaican Patois

On the tape, Ford rants incoherently in what appears to be an imitation of a Jamaican dialect while throwing a series of random shapes with his arms.

Ford said in November that he quit drinking following his crack-smoking scandal.

In a TV interview at the time, Ford said: 'I've had a come-to-Jesus moment if you want to call it that. Just the humiliation and the belittling and the people I've let down.

'And it's all because of alcohol. Excessive, stupid, immature behavior and that's it.'

The mayor acknowledged last year that he smoked crack 'in one of my drunken stupors' after police said they obtained a copy of a tape that appears to show him smoking crack.

Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced in May when reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video.

Before the mayor admitted the video was filmed on Monday, his brother and fellow politician Doug Ford defended him by saying it was not filmed recently because his brother had stopped drinking in November.

Doug Ford said: 'He's a lot heavier in that picture than he is now...It couldn't have been last night.'

When asked whether it was appropriate for his brother to put on an accent, Doug Ford ducks the question saying he hasn't actually seen the video.

Ford gestured wildly and appeared to not know he was being filmed during his drunken rant

Earlier this month, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process.

Muzik is known party palace for both 
locals and visitors, in the past entertaining touring musicians like 
Justin Bieber as well as celebrities and sport stars.

Numerous
 photos of the 44-year-old looking hot and sweaty popped up on Instagram
 and Twitter, posted by revelers surprised to see Ford wandering around 
the dance floor.

Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's 
brother and campaign manager, said the appearance was in the name of 
drumming up support for the forthcoming election, set for October 27.

He said the mayor consumed only a sugar-free energy drink and was at the club for about an hour.

'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford earlier told The Toronto Sun. 'There
 have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, thereâ€™s been the 
Bieber there and no one got a response like Rob did.

'The place went upside down ballistic.

'All he did was take pictures.'
