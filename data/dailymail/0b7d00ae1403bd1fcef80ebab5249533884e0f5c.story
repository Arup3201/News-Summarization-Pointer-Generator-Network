Town hall chiefs have been condemned as ‘ruthless’ after claims they pursued a sick man over a disputed £35 council tax bill as he lay dying in hospital.

A council employee telephoned the intensive care unit of the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke where Michael Smith, 56, was being treated for a lung infection a week before he died.

When told by nursing staff he was unable to take the call since he was in a coma, the official added to the family’s stress by leaving a message for the patient’s 84-year-old disabled mother – who was at his bedside – to call him back.

‘Someone called while I was there, asking to speak to Michael, but he was on a life-support machine,’ said Mr Smith’s mother Audrey.

‘The nurse was left a number for me to ring them back. It was rotten of the council to do that.’

Mr Smith’s friend Ian Howgate, said: ‘They were ruthless and harassed him right to the time he died.’

Mr Smith, from Hungerford, Berkshire, a former road sweeper, died on August 15 and his funeral took place last week.

Local Conservative MPs Richard Benyon and Sir George Young have said they will investigate the matter.

West Berkshire Council refused to discuss its decision to telephone the hospital.
