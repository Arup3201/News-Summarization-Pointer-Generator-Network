Princess Eugenie's boyfriend has had pictures of him engaging with a naked stripper leaked online.

The six images allegedly show Jack Brooksbank, 27, groping the naked woman's breasts and being blindfolded while covered in candle wax.

Jack, who works in the gastropub trade, is also seen on all fours on the floor as the stripper, reportedly twice his age, straddles him using leather bondage gear

Shame: Jack Brooksbank, pictured with his royal girlfriend Princess Eugenie last month, is allegedly depicted in close contact in six raunchy images leaked online

The six images, described as 'too raunchy to publish' by the Sun on Sunday, were removed shortly after Buckingham Palace was alerted to their existence.

'What's especially embarrassing is the pictures were posted by a close friend who has many royal connections,' a source told the Sun on Sunday.

The stripper photographs were published by a female friend who attended the party, reportedly Jack's 21st birthday celebrations, which took place before he started seeing his royal partner, according to a Palace source.

'A group of friends arranged it for a prank to celebrate his 21st birthday,' the insider told the newspaper, adding that it was not Jack's 'usual sort of behaviour'.

Blast from the past: The pictures of Jack, 27, and the stripper were reportedly taken at his 21st birthday party which took place before he started seeing his girlfriend of three years

The couple have been dating since 2010 
and maintained a long-distance relationship throughout Eugenieâ€™s studies
at Newcastle University.

She graduated last year with a 2:1 in English and history of Art and is set to take up a full-time position at U.S. auction house Paddle8, based in New York, in October.

The princess and her Stowe-educated boyfriend are planning to go back to a long-distance relationship as he keeps his bar job in London.

Jack and Eugenie, who are distant cousins, are expected to join Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas on their safari trip to Botswana this week
