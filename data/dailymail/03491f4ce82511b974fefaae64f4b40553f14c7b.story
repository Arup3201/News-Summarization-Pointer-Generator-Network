When Bernard Cribbins wants to get something off his chest about children's TV, the powers that be might want to take notice.

A legend of the genre, during his 71-year showbiz career Bernard's not only voiced 70s hit The Wombles (yes, every character), but he's also read more Jackanory stories than anyone else and, in 2009, was awarded a BAFTA for his children's TV work. But today he's not happy.

'Children's TV is so frantic now, they've neglected the fundamentals of traditional storytelling,' he says.

'There's too much fast editing and CGI - the very opposite of Jackanory.' Which is why he became involved with the popular BBC teatime TV series Old Jack's Boat, a mix of live action and animation in which he plays a retired fisherman who tells tall tales about his fantastic adventures with his faithful Hungarian Vizsla dog Salty.

'What I like about Old Jack's Boat is that it's just like Jackanory - me telling a tale straight to camera with my lovely dog.'

The sad irony of Bernard's life, however, is that he and his wife Gill - who've been married since 1955 - couldn't have children of their own in those pre-IVF days after she suffered an early miscarriage. 'It would have been nice to be parents, but I don't feel wistful about it any more,' he says.

'If we'd had our own children, they'd all be bigger than me now and shouting at me,' he adds wryly.Instead they acquired lots of godchildren and a succession of beloved dogs. 'They could well have been child substitutes without us knowing,' admits Bernard. 'The thing about dogs is they give you unconditional love - and they don't have teenage years!'

Their last dog Rosie was a 'delightful' Jack Russell that died three years ago, and they haven't been able to bring themselves to replace her. Naturally, Bernard was involved in the casting of Salty, whose real name is Scuzz.

There's talk of a new series of Old Jack's Boat spin-off, Salty's Waggy Tales, as well as a dog show for the Parachute Regiment's Afghanistan Trust charity next year, to which Bernard - who did his National Service in the Paras - hopes to take Scuzz along as star guest.

Meanwhile, his latest family project sees him recording the narration for Sir Richard Stilgoe's children's musical Brilliant - The Dinosaur, which begins a UK tour of theatres next spring. He hopes the show will introduce a new generation of children to the simple joys of live theatre.

The Dinosaur show tells the story of how a hurricane opens up a cave in England and reveals a reptile that's been hibernating for 65 million years. 'The dinosaur will be 100ft long, female and wearing pink lipstick,' says Bernard.

Old Jack's Boat is shown on CBeebies, weekdays at 5.45pm

Now 85, Bernard's been performing for as long as Sir Bruce Forsyth, and says he has no plans to retire. 'Showbusiness keeps me young. I'll carry on until I have to stop. If I wasn't producing the goods they'd get someone else in.'

He's worked with everyone from comedy legend Peter Sellers and the first Bond girl Ursula Andress to Catherine Tate and David Tennant in Doctor Who.

He was even a pop singer in the early 60s with the novelty hits Right Said Fred and The Hole In The Ground. One of the last survivors of the Carry On films, Bernard never thinks of himself as a star.

'I'm like an itinerant fruit-picker, going from orchard to orchard to pick up work,' says the Oldham-born son of a plumber's mate.

He met Gill when he was a young stage manager/actor in Oldham and she was his assistant. 'She would often join me on tour or on foreign film shoots. It's very easy to get tempted in my business if you're feeling fruity,' says Bernard, who claims he still gets a funny turn at the memory of working with the beautiful Ursula Andress in the 1965 adventure film She.

'But I always wanted to keep on the straight and narrow, just do the job I love and go home,' he concludes.

And his favourite audience of all? 'Children - they're wonderfully receptive. So although I don't have any of my own, I feel very lucky I've got lots of other children who sit and listen to my stories.'

Old Jack's Boat, CBeebies, weekdays, 5.45pm. Brilliant - The Dinosaur will begin a UK tour next spring.
