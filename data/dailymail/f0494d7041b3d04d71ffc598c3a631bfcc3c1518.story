This is the shocking moment a paramedic looks on with his hands in his pockets as a man collapses and dies right in front of him.

CCTV footage shows the moment Carl Cope falls to the ground in agony - but paramedic Matt Geary simply watches on instead of helping the dying man. 

Despite confessing he had done nothing to help Mr Cope, Geary, 36, escaped a jail term and instead was sentenced for health and safety offences for failing to examine or resuscitate him.  

Shock: Heartless paramedic Matt Geary (in white shirt) looks on with his hands in his pockets as Carl Cope lies dying in front of him just yards from Walsall Manor Hospital accident and emergency department

Panic: CCTV footage shows security guards rushing to help Mr Cope, as Geary (in white shirt) can clearly be seen with his hands in his pockets refusing to help

Geary and a colleague were called when Mr Cope, 47, dialled 999 after collapsing on a grass verge suffering chest pains close to his home early on 23 June 2012.

Paramedic Geary − who was responsible for determining the course of treatment for Mr Cope − then took him to Walsall Manor Hospital accident and emergency department.

Footage from the hospital waiting room shows Mr Cope struggling to make himself comfortable and visibly in a lot of pain. After seven minutes, he leaves to visit a nearby shop to get a drink.

But on his way back through the car park shortly after 11.13am, Mr Cope is seen collapsing close to the hospital doors.

Geary can clearly be seen watching from the ambulance as Mr Cope remains on the ground for more than 30 seconds.

Struggling to his feet, Mr Cope only manages a few steps before fatally collapsing for a second - and final - time.

Geary, who was fully aware of Mr Cope's condition having brought him to the hospital, is seen looking on from his ambulance before finally going to his patient.

But he takes no equipment with him and instead casually stands over Mr Cope with his hands in his pockets, talking to him for two minutes. 

After taking a closer look at Mr Cope, Geary then asks the hospital security to deal with him, before returning to his ambulance at 11.15am.

When the security guard is seen arriving a full five minutes later, Mr Cope did not appear to be showing any signs of life.

A post mortem examination later revealed Mr Cope died of a heart attack. 

Expert evidence indicated that had Mr Cope's chest pain been considered cardiac and had he been monitored properly then his chances of survival would have been significantly higher. 

Staggering: Mr Cope (circled) is seen stumbling through the hospital car park after leaving accident and emergency to buy himself a drink. Seconds later, he collapses after suffering a heart attack  

Collapse: Immediately after Mr Cope falls to the ground at 11.13am, Geary (circled) can be seen looking on calmly from his ambulance to the right of the screen as cars swerve to avoid him

Approach: Reluctantly, Geary (circled) then calmly strolled toward Mr Cope and spoke to him for two minutes before deciding not to help the dying man

Abandoned: But Geary is then seen turning his back on Mr Cope at 11.15am and instead alerts hospital security and asks them to deal with the dying man 

Ignored: Geary is then seen calmly strolling back to his ambulance, having deciding not to help Mr Cope. He is left alone and in agony just yards outside the hospital doors

Dying: A full seven minutes after Mr Cope first fell to the ground in agony, Geary (in white shirt) can be seen looking on after security guards finally arrived to help. By now, it was 11.20am and Mr Cope was not showing any sign of life

Geary was handed an eight month suspended sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 240 hours community service. 

Brian Dean, defending him, said: 'His career as a paramedic is now over.' 

Sentencing, Judge John Warner described Geary's treatment of Mr Cope as a 'truly lamentable' sequence of events. 

Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, who led the two-year investigation into Mr Cope's death, said: 'Carl had a serious heart condition - that's why he dialled 999.

'After Carl collapsed outside the hospital, Geary did nothing on that day to care for him and there is a chance that if he had actually done something, then Carl would still be alive today.

'Geary's actions were purely his own, as indicated by the CCTV which shows him with his hands in his pockets while Carl dies in front of him. 

'He is no way an example of other ambulance staff, the vast majority of whom do a wonderful job in challenging circumstances.

'The CCTV was handed to us by West Midlands Ambulance Service, who were also concerned about what they had seen.' 

Devastated: Mr Cope's brother Paul outside Wolverhampton Crown Court tonight. In a statement, the family said: 'It's hard to lose a loved one but to lose a loved one under such tragic circumstances has had a devastating effect on our family'

He added: 'We hope this case reassures people that where we find evidence of wrongdoing and if proved, we will work tirelessly to secure a conviction.

'As ever, our condolences remain with Carl's family who continue to grieve for their loss in these tragic circumstances.'

Mr Cope, from Bloxwich, near Walsall,  would have celebrated his 50th birthday last year.

In a statement, his heartbroken family of four brothers and two sisters, said: 'Nobody should ever have to go through what we have endured for the past two-and-a-half years.

'It's hard to lose a loved one but to lose a loved one under such tragic circumstances has had a devastating effect on our family.

'We still can't understand what happened to him that day and none of us can come to terms with the loss that someone - who was such a big part of our family - was taken from us so unneccesarily.'

Scene: Walsall Manor Hospital where Mr Cope died in June 2012. Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, who led the investigation into his death, said: 'Carl had been treated very poorly and we were determined the circumstances surrounding his death were not simply swept under the carpet'

Geary was among five ambulance and hospital staff arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with Mr Cope's death in December 2012.

However, detectives were unable to proceed with the manslaughter charges as there was a chance Mr Cope may not have survived his heart attack.

Det Insp Spanner added: 'We had seen the CCTV footage of Carl collapsing and listened to his 999 call.

'Carl had been treated very poorly and we were determined the circumstances surrounding his death were not simply swept under the carpet.

'We couldn't move forward with a manslaughter prosecution so we began to investigate what other offences may have been committed.

'Three people − Geary, another ambulance worker and a nurse − who were no longer working in their jobs as a result of the initial investigation, were then charged with failing to discharge their duties in taking care of the health and safety of Carl Cope.'

Geary, from Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, admitted the charge against him in December 2014 with charges against the other two later being dropped.
