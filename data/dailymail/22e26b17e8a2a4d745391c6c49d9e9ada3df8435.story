A foster carer has claimed her husband was killed by the stress of a 'botched' £120,000 council extension to their home.

John Gibbins suffered a heart attack and died at just 52 after battling with the local authority for 17 months to sort out the problems.

The project - built to help house their six foster children - allegedly left water streaming down the walls, a flooded cellar and a damp kitchen after being built in 2013.

'The stress of the whole situation was too much for him,' said Sue Gibbins, of Llanarth in Ceredigion, Wales 

'He was extremely upset, and knew as a builder what they were doing wrong.

'He was very upset about the whole thing; we just wanted more space for the foster kids.

'One day, after months of getting nowhere with the council, he just went and sat down in the front room.

'When I went in, he was dead.He had suffered a massive heart attack.'

Mr Gibbins died in June this year. 

The couple, who had looked after the six children aged seven to 18 since 2006, had to wait over two years after plans were approved for work to even start on the extension.

'What was supposed to be a help to our family, turned out to be the worst situation imaginable,' added 54-year-old Sue.

'We were just trying to do our best for the foster kids and Ceredigion Council offered the extension and at the time we were glad. We had no idea it would end up like this.'

The extension, which provided three bedrooms and two bathrooms, has still not been fixed despite repeat promises.

Mrs Gibbins claimed the extension carried out by Ceredigion County Council has still not been fixed

'I am getting nowhere with the council,' she said.

'People come round and disappear, but we have heard nothing.

'It has dragged on for 17 months and it needs to be sorted for the sake of my family.'

Back in November 2012 Mr Gibbins, who was a builder by trade, said  that the extension was causing 'a lot of stress'.

'There's a lot of stress that's been put on the family,' he said.

'My wife has been crying her eyes out and there's no need for it. It's breaking us all up.'  

 A spokesman for Ceredigion County Council said today: 'The Council has been involved in this large scheme which involved the construction of an extension to the property. 

'The majority of this scheme has been satisfactorily completed, although it is acknowledged that as there are inherent difficulties with carrying out works to old properties, a snagging list of additional works has been identified and agreed. 

'We are currently liaising with the client to agree a convenient and appropriate time for these works to be completed.

'We were saddened to hear of the client’s family loss.'
