Accused: Lori Carmichael Quigley has been charged with having sex with at least two of her students, but police believe she may have bedded more

A 41-year-old teacher has been accused of having sex with two students - with police fearing there could be many other victims.

Lori Carmichael Quigley was arrested at her home a week after she resigned her position as a math teacher.

She is alleged to have had sex with the students at the McIntosh County Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, sources told WTEV.

Police have charged her with three counts of sexual assault upon a person under supervision or discipline, said Maj. Danny Lowe from McIntosh County Sheriff's Office.

He said the investigation was ongoing and feared other students were victims of the married mother of two.

'We think there's more out there,' said Major Lowe.

All three of the male students at McIntosh Academy were at least 16 years of age, Lowe said.

Although 16 is the age of consent in Georgia, the law forbids school personnel from having sex with students.

All of the alleged sexual encounters occurred on school property, Lowe said.

He did not elaborate on where the sex supposedly took place but said Quigley had taught the assumed victims.

'The charges are serious, all three felonies,' said Lowe.

Quigley, who was arrested Friday, was denied bail.

Students and parents at the school told WTEV they were shocked by the arrest.

'I'm just really surprised its going on here, I'm sorry it's happening,' said Bonnie Cobb.

Schools Superintendent Tina Kirby said she could not comment due to the pending criminal charges.

'I'm really not at liberty to say anything because it's an ongoing criminal investigation,' said Tina Kirby.

Quigley had been teaching advanced level math to ninth- through-12th graders since 2005 at the school.
