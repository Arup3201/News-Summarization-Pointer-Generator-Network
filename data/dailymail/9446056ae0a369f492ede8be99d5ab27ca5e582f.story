Filmmaker Roman Polanski appeared in a court in Poland on Wednesday for a hearing concerning a U.S. request for his extradition charges of sex with a minor, a case that has haunted him since 1977.

Judge Dariusz Mazur was not expected to make a ruling on Wednesday and scheduled another hearing, buying time to study documents that arrived this week from Switzerland, which in 2010 refused to extradite Polanski. 

The next hearing could be in April or sooner, according to court spokeswoman Grazyna Rokita.

Wearing a dark suit, the Oscar-winning director entered the court in Krakow with his two Polish lawyers. On the attorneys' request, the court banned media from the hearing.

Polanski, 81, is in Poland preparing to make a movie about Alfred Dreyfus, a 19th-century French army officer wrongly accused of spying.

Prosecutors in Polanski's childhood city of Krakow, where he has an apartment, have refused a U.S. request to arrest him, but have said there are no legal obstacles to his extradition and have asked the court for a ruling.

If the judge refuses to hand Polanski over, the case is closed. If he allows the extradition, the final decision will belong to the justice minister.

The Oscar-winning director is a celebrity in Poland, where many politicians have indicated reluctance to hand him over, arguing he has already paid a heavy price and repented for what he did.

An Interpol warrant for Polanski's arrest is in effect in 188 countries. He avoids extradition by traveling only between France, Poland and Switzerland. He has French and Polish passports.

Polanski, director of classics like Rosemary’s Baby and Chinatown, pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los Angeles.

He served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain in 1977 before he fled the United States on the eve of his sentencing the following year.

In 2009, he was arrested in Zurich on a U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest but was freed the following year after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him.

In 2013, Mrs Geimer described in graphic detail for the first time what happened on the day of the attack in Jack Nicholson’s LA home.

In her book, The Girl, she wrote about how Polanski told her mother he wanted to take pictures of the teen for French Vogue but would not allow her to accompany her daughter.

In her book, The Girl, Geimer, left, revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her underwear before giving her a sleeping pill

Describing the sexual assault, Mrs Geimer revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her underwear before giving her a sleeping pill.

During the screening of a documentary of his life at the Zurich Film Festival in 2011, Polanski said Mrs Geimer was a ‘double victim’ after she was caught up in the media glare of his arrest in 2009.
