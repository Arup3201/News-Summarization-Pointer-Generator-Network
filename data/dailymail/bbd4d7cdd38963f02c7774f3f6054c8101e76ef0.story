Sir Ian Botham says his Twitter account was hacked by 'idiots' today after a picture of a penis was published on his timeline.

The explicit image was sent with the caption: 'What are you thinking....xx' but the former England captain says he is the victim of a tasteless joke.

The 58-year-old, who is married with three children, told followers he was 'hacked' and 'not very funny whoever did that' minutes after the photograph appeared.

Upset: Sir Ian Botham says 'idiots' have hacked his Twitter account and posted a picture of a penis on his timeline

Message: This tweet accompanied the explicit picture that appeared on his timeline this morning

Response: Sir Ian told people he was hacked and that the message was 'not very funny'

The former Test team captain later tweeted: 'I would like to thank the hacker....I've just got 500 hits in 20mins !!' He later added: 'Make that 700 in 25 mins !!!'

Poking fun: 'Beefy' retweeted this top trumps spoof

Mr Botham is being widely lampooned after the incident by friends, colleagues and others online - many using the hashtag #middlestump.

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said he had been put off having sausages for breakfast and has chosen granola instead.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan said in reference to Botham's account that someone has been taking 'selfies to another level today' before trying to copy the pose in the photo with his clothes on.

Others online speculated the picture was published to celebrate England's emphatic victory over India yesterday. 

Sir Ian was famous for being arguably England's greatest ever cricket and his flamboyant antics on and off the field.

In his autobiography he admitted that during his last ball in first class cricket he unzipped his trousers and let 'his "old man" dangle free'.

In 1986 he was suspended for two months by the England and Wales Cricket Board for smoking cannabis. 

In 2001, Sir Ian’s two-year affair in the 1990s with Kylie Verrells – a waitress he met while working in Australia – was on the verge of being exposed and he was forced to confess all to his family.

The 58-year-old admitted to Piers Morgan in an interview this year: ‘I don’t know why [the affair] started. I’d pushed myself into a very awkward corner and there was only one way I could get out – by being honest, by confronting it and moving on.

‘I had to rebuild the whole family. It wasn’t so much saying, it was doing, and being there, being available, going out of my way to be available. In fact doing everything a normal father does.’ 

Kathy Botham was also interviewed for the show and told Morgan: ‘Ian would get on the phone and say, “Hi, there’s going to be something in the papers over the next few days”, and my heart would just sink.

He has fallen out publicly with a number of cricketers, including Imran Khan, who won the most expensive libel case in cricketing history in 1996 - leaving Botham with a £500,000 legal bill when he lost. 

MailOnline has approached Sir Ian's agent for comment.
