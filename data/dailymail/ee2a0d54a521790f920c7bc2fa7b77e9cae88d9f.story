It certainly isn’t the first time she has been handed a bouquet – but judging by the Queen’s delighted expression the novelty never wears off.

Her Majesty was approached by schoolgirl Martha Campbell as she left a service of celebration yesterday to mark the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible.

The service at Westminster Abbey was led by the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. The Queen, 85, was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales.

Dr Williams paid tribute to the ‘extraordinary’ and ‘abiding importance’ of the King James Bible - so named because it was a translation ordered by James I. Early editions were presented at the altar at the service attended by 2,000 people.

The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales led around 2,000 worshippers at the service in Westminster Abbey where early editions of the Bible were presented at the altar.

Dr Williams told the congregation that the translators would have been 'baffled and embarrassed' by the idea of a perfect translation but had sought instead to convey the 'almost unbearable weight of divine intelligence and love' into the English language.

'The temptation is always there for the modern translator to look for strategies that make the text more accessible - and when that temptation comes, it doesn't hurt to turn for a moment - for some long moments indeed - to this extraordinary text,' he said.

The service was attended by senior clerics including the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, the Bishop of London Dr Richard Chartres and Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, former head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales.

Aversion of the People's Bible, hand-written by more than 22,000 people, formed part of the procession of Bibles to the altar.

Organisers said the contributions came from a five-month tour of Britain with visits to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Devon, Whitby, Glasgow, Swansea, Wrexham and London, including verses written by protesters at the Occupy London camp outside St Paul's Cathedral.

Celebrities who hand wrote verses included the Prince of Wales, who is patron of the King James Bible Trust, David Cameron and Dr Williams.

Other backers included comedian and broadcaster Frank Skinner and the actors Timothy West and Prunella Scales.

The congregation also heard a new composition by one of the winners of the King James Bible Trust composition awards, US composer Zachary Wadsworth.

The service comes after lectures, educational programmes and theatre performances around the world marking the anniversary of the Bible dubbed the 'DNA of the English language' by broadcaster Melvyn Bragg.

The translation was first ordered by James I at Hampton Court Palace in 1604 as he attempted to forge unity between England and Scotland.

The Bible, also known as the Authorised Version, was the work of 54 scholars working in six translation committees - or companies - based in Oxford, Cambridge, and Westminster.

The final editing took place in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey where the translators read their new version of the Bible aloud.

Expressions in the Bible such as 'the powers that be' 'the apple of his eye' 'signs of the times' and a 'law unto themselves' are still part of the English language.

The global impact of its language was famously highlighted when US civil rights campaigner Dr Martin Luther King used its version of Isaiah chapter 40 verses 4-5 in his 1963 'I Have a Dream' speech.
