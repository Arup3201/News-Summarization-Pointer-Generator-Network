A man from southern New Jersey has apparently killed his wife and young son before taking his own life in what police consider to be a murder-suicide.

The tragedy unfolded Tuesday in Pitman - a town of about 9,000 located 15 miles south of Philadelphia - where local authorities found the bodies of 49-year-old Francis Adolf, his 44-year-old wife, Bonnie, and the couple's 6-year-old son, Francis Jr.

Authorities say when they arrived at the home of the Adolf family, they found the husband's writings indicating that he intended to harm himself and his loved ones.

Crime scene: A police vehicle is parked outside the Adolfs' home on Kenton Avenue in Pitman, New Jersey, where three family members were found dead

The medical examiner is expected to perform autopsies on the bodies to determine the cause and manner of death.

Police arrived at 65 Kenton Avenue at around 10am Tuesday to perform a welfare check after getting a call from someone expressing concern. As officers walked into the house, they discovered the bodies of Francis Adolf, his wife and son.

Handwritten notes and emails authored by Francis Adolf led investigators to believe that he had planned to kill his family and then himself. 

Mr Adolf worked as a nurse at Virtua Health System along with his wife, and was a self-described Christian libertarian. According to his Facebook page, he attended Gloucester County Community Church.

According to Bonnie Adolf's page, the woman graduated from Helene Fuld School of Nursing in Camden in 1990. The couple married in 2004.

Francis Adolf had been active on Twitter and had 210 followers. Outlining his personal philosophy, he wrote: ‘I'm a Christian Libertarian but I frequenty [sic] find myself tweeting in the flesh, and sometimes in the nude too.’

Alarming: Officers were performing a welfare check after getting a phone call when they came upon the dead family. Cops also found Francis Adolf's writings indicating that he had been planning to harm his family

The 49-year-old nurse posted messages criticizing President Barack Obama and his signature health care legislation; the Catholic Church and social welfare. Some of his tweets were particularly odd.

On July 27, he wrote: ‘Finally, out of the ER. Driving/texting and the Percocet is kicking in. Weeeeeeeeeee!!!’

Three days later, Mr Adolf posted an enigmatic message on Twitter, writing: 'Goodbye forever twitter. My Marriage is too important. Pray for me, my wife and family. Love you all. Thanks.' 

Local authorities have said that there was no history of domestic abuse in the Adolf household, although one neighbor recalled hearing loud arguments between Bonnie and Francis.

Other homeowners in the area described the 49-year-old husband and father as asocial and not very talkative, with at least one person, Gus Bader, labeling him as ‘strange,’ according to NJ.com.

Members of the tight-knit community were left in equal measures shocked and puzzled after learning of the tragedy.

Neighbors told NBC 10 Philadelphia that Francis Adolf Jr, known to all as Frankie, was about to turn 7 years old and was getting ready to enter second grade at Memorial Elementary School.

Pitman Mayor Russ Johnson III said the slain boy and his own son were classmates.

‘You've got to do your best as parents but I don't know how I can possibly explain it to my kid -- to any of those kids in that school,’ the mayor said.

The elementary school sent a statement out to parents, saying that Frankie died in a tragic incident.

‘Everyone here in the district -- especially those within the Memorial School community -- is heartbroken about the loss of Frankie,’ the missive read. ‘We extend our sympathy to all of Frankie's family and friends, and to the wider community of Pitman, on this very sad day.’

Local resident Jack Klose, 66, described the 6-year-old victim as a 'beautiful boy' who was his grandson's best friend.

Francis Adolf’s mother, Delores, told The Philadelphia Inquirer she could not explain what happened.

‘Bad things happen to good people,’ she summed it up.
