David Cameron will leave his political woes behind over Easter by flying off for a break in the sun.

The Prime Minister, who spoke on Wednesday of his ‘difficult week’, will head off to Lanzarote for a holiday with his family.

The revelation came just hours after he told listeners on BBC Radio Norfolk that he would be spending Easter with his wife Samantha’s family – with no mention of plans to spend a week in the Canary Islands.

Asked about his intentions for the break, he said: ‘I am going to be spending time with my mother-in-law.’ He added: ‘I think I am spending Easter Day with Samantha’s family.’

Downing Street refused to comment on security grounds. Aides are also sensitive about publicity surrounding thePrime Minister’s frequent foreign holidays at a time of continuing austerity at home.

But Spanish media quoted police sources on Lanzarote as saying security measures were being put in place for his expected arrival on the island on Saturday, along with Samantha and their children Nancy, Arthur and Florence.

Local sources reported the family will be staying in an upmarket hotel in a rural setting, a few miles from the coast.

Mr Cameron took his brood on several holidays last year, including one to Ibiza in May and to the Algarve, Portugal, in July.

Director of the island’s tourist board Hector Fernandez described the Prime Minister’s choice as an ‘important pat on the back’ for Lanzarote’s reputation, as it shakes off the nickname ‘Lanzagrotty’ it acquired during the early days of package holidays.

On their return, the Camerons are expected to travel to the Oxfordshire manor house owned by Samantha’s mother Annabel and her husband Viscount Astor, a former Tory minister.

Around 1.6million tourists visit Lanzarote each year – the majority (around 800,000) from the UK. The weather over the next week will be mainly sunny, with temperatures ranging between 21-23C (70-73F).

The Prime Minister revealed his Easter plans after he spoke of his Christian faith at a Downing Street reception on Wednesday, saying he believes the ‘Big Society’ project is doing God’s work.

The island was formed 15million years ago from the solidified lava streams and rock formations of a volcanic blast.

Tourist beaches have golden sand shipped in from the Sahara – but others retain their volcanic sand which is naturally black.

It is 78 miles from the coast of Morocco and is the fourth largest of the Canary Islands at 327 square miles.

The outdoor scenes of the 1966 caveman film One Million Years BC, starring Raquel Welch in a fur bikini, were shot there.

The sun shines for ten hours a day in summer, while in winter temperatures rarely fall below a balmy 21C (70F).

One of the island’s lagoons, formed during a volcanic eruption, is home to a unique species of blind albino crab.
