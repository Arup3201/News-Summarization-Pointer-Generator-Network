They followed all the procedures of a typical 'man overboard'-type rescue.

But despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR, there was nothing that could be done for a man found floating in Lake Michigan this week.

After all, its pretty hard to revive a plastic zombie corpse.

The Chicago Coast Guard received a call over something suspicious in the water and arrived to find a head bobbing in the lake.

Eerie: The body seemed as if it could be a particularly gruesome discovery

Phew: Fortunately, it turned out to be a life-sized Halloween zombie prop

Eek: Albeit a seriously scary one, dressed as a surgeon

Chief Petty Officer Alan Haraf told WGN TV a boat crew from Station Wilmette Harbor 'rescued' the 120-pound mannequin.

Haraf said the zombie posed a hazard to navigation in the area.

He added that it should also be returned to its owner.

Making light of the situation, one member performed mouth-to-mouth on the creepy Halloween prop.

Gruesome: The zombie was part of a Haunted House-themed barge that sank nearby in a storm

The Coast Guard said the zombie was part of the The Zombie Containment Haunted House, which was set up for Halloween at the nearby Navy Pier.

However the barge sank at the weekend after being hit by freak weather.

Waves and powerful winds smashed the pier in a storm and caused the floating structure to partially sink.

Events along the pier, including the Ferris wheel, Grand Ballroom and East End Plaza, had to be cancelled.
