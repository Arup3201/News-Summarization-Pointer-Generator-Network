A suspected terrorist granted refugee status by Britain has been banned from flying back into the country over fears he could be plotting a terror attack, it was revealed today.

It is understood that security officials have ordered airlines around the world to stop Reda Taher Nasouf boarding planes bound for the UK.

Steps are also being taken by officials to strip the Algerian, who is believed to be in the north African country, of his refugee status, according to the Daily Mirror.

Flight ban: It is understood that security officials have ordered airlines around the world to stop Reda Taher Nasouf boarding planes bound for the UK

It is the first time such a ban has been used to prevent a suspect flying into Britain because of terror fears, according to the newspaper.

The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases, but a spokesman told the Mail Online: ‘We make no apologies for refusing people access to the UK if we believe they represent a threat.

‘Coming here is a privilege we refuse to extend to those who seek to subvert our values.’

A source told the Mirror: 'It is about disrupting something in the planning stages before it becomes a risk to British citizens and it was not done without careful consideration.

'Everything is being done to strip this man of his refugee status.'

Under the Aviation Security Act 1982, the Secretary of State is able to direct any airline operating in the UK to take any measure necessary to counter any threat to aviation.

Intelligence officers have been tracking Nasouf for months and suspect he could be in the early stages of plotting a terror attack against UK civilians, according to The Mirror.

It is thought he may have already spent some time in Britain as a refugee but returned to Algeria allegedly to plot his atrocity and was hoping to return soon.

The UK Border Agency will today begin proceeding to revoke Nasouf's refugee status, the tabloid claimed.

The security alert threat level last night remained at 'substantial' meaning a terror attack in the UK is a 'strong possibility'.
