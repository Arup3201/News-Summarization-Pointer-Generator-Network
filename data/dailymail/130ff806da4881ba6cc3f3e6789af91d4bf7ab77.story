A camper impressing his friends camping in Oregon with some mean licks on his guitar attracted a nasty admirer earlier this month - a rabid bat.

Derrick Skou, from Oregon was jamming away when the bat swooped down from the sky and landed on the startled guitar players neck.

Expecting the bat to fly off once it had realized where it has landed, Skou was obviously shocked to get a nip on the neck from the blood-thirsty creature.

Swooped: The bat can be seen on Skou's neck - having flown around the three men who were relaxing while camping 

Luckily for Skou, a quick thinking friend fired a BB gun at the bat and killed it, enabling them to take it along with their friend to hospital for testing.

Once there they discovered that the bat had the fatal condition rabies, which animals pass on through their saliva and blood.

Skou was started on an immediate regime of drugs to battle the effects of rabies, which have left him tired and exhausted.

'This thing came out of nowhere,' said Derrick Skou to KBOI. 'I was thinking it was a good day until then.'

Get off! The bat crawls up Skou's neck and bites him with its rabies infected teeth

'Something hit me. I was concentrating on staying in time and all that, and it hit me here, and I kind of saw something out of my peripheral vision. And then it's there, and then it just bit me.'

The first that Skou knew was when he saw the bat land on his neck.

'It was like a cold dog nose,' said Skou. 'It was a cold bat nose, mouth, whatever. It didn't sting. I wasn't injected with anything. It was just a cold bite.'

The bat tried to swoop down for two more passes before it was shot dead.

'Whether we would get in trouble for shooting it, and I said well, it drew first blood. We need to take care of this thing,' Skou said.
