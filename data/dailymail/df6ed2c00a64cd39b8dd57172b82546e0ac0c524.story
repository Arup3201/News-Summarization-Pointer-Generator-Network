A Chinese elevator engineer was crushed to death when the chair he had wedged in the door to stop the lift from moving was pulled away.

Repair man Wu Ming was standing on top of a lift in a block of flats in the city of Fuzhou, south-east China, when the chair was removed by someone who did not want to use the stairs.

Mr Ming was killed instantly when the lift moved upwards, crushing his head and torso.

Mr Ming had been called to the 16-storey block of flats to carry out routine maintenance on the elevator.

Instead of cutting off the power, he had simply stuck a chair in the door to stop it moving, and then climbed up onto its roof. 

The police said the person who moved the chair would not face criminal proceedings because they would not have known the fatal consequences when they decided not to take the stairs.

A spokesman for the company that employed Mr Ming said: 'We are investigating but it is company policy and part of our training that the power is always cut off while work is being carried out.

'It certainly isn't standard to put a chair in the door in the hope that it will remain there while work is being carried out.' 

The crush was recorded as an accident at the workplace. Health and safety inspectors are investigating the incident.
