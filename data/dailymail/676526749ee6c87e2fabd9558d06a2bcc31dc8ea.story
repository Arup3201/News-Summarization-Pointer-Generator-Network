There can be few sights more welcome first thing in the morning than a turquoise sea, a white sandy beach and palm trees swaying in the wind.

At Thomson's Sensatori resort - on the eastern, Caribbean side of the Yucatan Peninsula in the south east of Mexico - you're greeted by this sight every morning.

The resort is on its own beautiful stretch of beach, protected from some of the fiercer waves you get further down the coast, and the wind is more of a breeze.

Come on in, the water's lovely: The Sensatori resort sits on Mexico's Caribbean coast, on the Riviera Maya

Straw-topped cabanas dotted across the sand provide the ultimate way to while away the day, either in the shade or on a lounger just in front of it. As you relax in the cabana, all that lies between your feet and the sparkling water is a few yards of perfectly manicured sand.

The first thing that strikes you when you arrive at the resort, on the Riviera Maya, is the abundance of pools. There are three main ones and a series of 'swim-up' pools attached to some rooms, which mean you can laze in the water without having to leave your accommodation.

Each room also has its own Jacuzzi, perfect for an evening drink as the sun sets - or, as my friend Jo and I discovered during a rare cloudy period, ideal for sitting in and reading a book.

One of the pools is definitely geared towards those who want to take advantage of the array of cocktails on offer as part of the all-inclusive deal.

Though the resort is quiet during the day and even the night time, if you do fancy a daytime drink, this is the place to do it. There's a swim-up bar and the friendly bar men will fix up anything.

For some inexplicable reason, Baileys seemed to be the most popular drink while I was there - not my first choice in 30C weather, but what do I know? The occasional cocktail aside, our daily routine at Sensatori was pretty much set in stone.

The day kicked off with breakfast at one of the six restaurants.

The buffet had everything you could want in gargantuan amounts: continental and cooked, and unlimited fruit and fresh juice meant you were definitely full until lunchtime.

One of the best things about being in an all-inclusive is that you don't have to carry anything around with you. The restaurant staff simply take your room number and you can eat and drink as much as you like.

There are lots of choices when it comes to the food. There are Mexican, Italian, Caribbean and American restaurants and also fine-dining at Le Cirque, the only one where you need to make a booking, and it isn't included in the all-inclusive deal.

We'd become so used to our routine of relaxation and eating that we really didn't want to go home. But it was only a short journey to Cancun airport, and stepping on to a new Dreamliner made the end just about bearable. 

Thomson (www.thomson.co.uk, 0871 230 2555) offers 11 nights at the Sensatori Resort Mexico on an all-inclusive basis from £1,728 per person.

This includes return flights from Gatwick on April 16, 2015.
