Patients with life threatening conditions are struggling to get hold of drugs in 80% of NHS trusts in England and Wales, a survey suggests.

Four out of five trusts are reporting delays because medicines intended for NHS patients are exported to other EU countries.

Quotas have been introduced to control the amount of drugs set aside for the NHS but this has been found to exacerbate the problem.

Shortages: Delays are reported in four out of five trusts because medicines intended for NHS patients are exported to other EU countries

Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies is calling for action from both the Government and industry, after more than 60 health authorities responded to his freedom of information request about drug shortages.

The member for Ogmore in Wales wrote on Twitter: 'Not good enough: over 60 responses from health authorities show gov't & industry need to act on medicine shortages.'

The Department of Health said it is considering an investigation into the scale of the problem.

A spokesman said: 'It is for manufacturers to ensure that any quotas set are flexible enough to cope with reasonable fluctuations in demand. Where quotas are used, companies setting them should also make sure that they are set fairly.

'Manufacturers should have their own contingency arrangements in place for pharmacies to be able to obtain medicines directly if they have problems getting hold of them.

'The government does maintain a buffer stock of certain essential medicines that can be released in emergencies. We will take any action necessary in the event of disruption to supply and distribution of medicines that causes serious risk to patients.'

In April health minister Simon Burns told Parliament that the department is considering a one-off survey of shortages of medicines at local pharmacies.

Last month MPs in the All-Party Pharmacy Group published a report on their inquiry into medicine shortages, which found that the problem is caused principally by the export of medicines intended for NHS patients to other EU countries. The practice is legal under European provisions for the free movement of goods.

The shortages are worsened by attempts by those in the supply chain to solve the problem through quotas and other alternative supply mechanisms, the report said.

Pharmacists then spend long periods of time sourcing medicines in short supply, meaning they have less time to spend with patients.

Also, patients were found to be suffering as a result of the shortages, with the group citing examples where those with serious conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and diabetes are unable to get crucial medicines when they need them.

There were also incidents of people being admitted to hospital as a direct result of medicine shortages.

The problem, ongoing for four years, is said to be getting worse, despite attempts by the Department of Health to address it.

The MPs said the government could take action as there is scope within European legislation for it to exempt certain goods if their free movement threatened public health.

But the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) defended the use of quotas as a legitimate means of ensuring UK patients receive the medicines they need. Their aim is to ensure that pharmacists do not present excessive orders to be fulfilled.

ABPI chief executive Stephen Whitehead said: 'We know that quotas are not the perfect answer to the problem: they are a sticking plaster not a cure.

'There have been occasions where manufacturers have received orders for medicines which represent more than the entire UK requirement for one particular medicine in one go. In one example a manufacturer received orders equivalent to 26 years' worth of the entire UK supply within a three-month period for one medicine.

'If orders of this excess were fulfilled then we would be left with no stock available for other UK pharmacists and patients wouldn't have access to the medicines they need, when they need them.

'If all the medicines manufacturers provided went to UK pharmacists, they would have in excess of what they need, but while these medicines continue to flow out of the UK these problems will persist. And make no mistake, patients will be affected.

'Removing quotas would not benefit patients but it could cause great harm. The only group who would benefit are the small percentage of pharmacists and wholesalers who actively sell medicines intended for UK patients abroad for a profit.'
