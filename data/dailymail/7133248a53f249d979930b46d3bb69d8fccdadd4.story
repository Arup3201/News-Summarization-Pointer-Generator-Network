The most depressing words of this young sporting year were spoken last week by Jimmy Anderson. 

By common consent, the England fast bowler is a gentle, pleasant, rather shy individual, whose attitudes change dramatically when he walks on to a cricket pitch. He then becomes a stage villain; angry, confrontational and abrasively insulting.

One of the more discordant sounds of an English summer is the distant drone of Anderson sledging his chosen victim. But he has no regrets; indeed, he is actually proud of his behaviour.

One of the more discordant sounds of an English summer is the distant drone of James Anderson sledging

England's Anderson (right) believes sledging is entertaining when done in the right manner 

‘I don’t think at the moment there is any more sledging than there’s been in the history of cricket,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it should disappear from the game. I think it’s quite entertaining when it’s done in the right manner.’

Equally smug is the Australian wicket keeper Brad Haddin, who defended David Warner after the serial buffoon had been heard to bawl ‘Speak English!’ at India’s Rohit Sharma. ‘We know the brand of cricket we want to play and Davey’s no different to all of us,’ said Haddin. ‘Every Australian team I’ve played in respects the game of cricket and respects the opposition. We’re pretty comfortable with the way we’re playing.’

He was supported by Australia’s coach Darren Lehmann, aka ‘Boof’. ‘If the ICC decides it’s not in the spirit of the game or we cross the line, it’ll come down on us,’ he said. ‘We’re always going to teeter pretty close to it, that’s just the way we play, but we’ve got to make sure we don’t cross it.’

Interestingly, Boof has some form on the disciplinary front. There was that unfortunate business in 2003, when he shouted ‘black *****’ in the dressing room after being run out against Sri Lanka at Brisbane. He was banned for five matches, thus escaping far too lightly. Then there was his jibe at England’s paceman Stuart Broad, shortly before the 2013-14 Ashes series Down Under: ‘I just hope the Australian public give it to him right from the word go for the whole summer, and I hope he cries and goes home.’ That’s Boof, one of nature’s line-crossers.

Now it is probably true that few people outside Australia take Lehmann seriously, but Anderson’s position is far more disturbing. For he sincerely believes that sledging, the crude, ugly, choreographed abuse of an opponent, is not only legitimate but ‘quite entertaining’. Andrew Flintoff exposed the fallacy of that approach in two concise sentences. ‘It seems you can walk onto the field, say anything you want about somebody and then walk off and forget about it,’ said Freddie. ‘You wouldn’t walk into somebody’s office and let rip at them for 10 minutes and then go for a cup of tea.’

Jonathan Agnew, the former England fast bowler and BBC cricket correspondent, expressed his concern rather more vigorously. ‘It’s all you hear on a field — “Knock his head off, knock his head off”,’ he said. ‘Cricket has gone too far. It shouldn’t be posturing, abusing.’

He defended aggressive bowling, but insisted: ‘It’s the histrionics, the nonsense, the prancing, the in-your-face nastiness. It’s become accepted, and actually it’s not acceptable at all.’

Agnew was absurdly attacked for his stand, on the grounds that cricketers have been behaving badly throughout the history of the game; as if oafishness was sanctified by custom. But he was undeniably correct. There is a worrying belief that the game alone is incapable of holding the public’s attention. Hence the search for trivial solutions and cheap gimmicks. Less a game, more a game show, in which nothing succeeds like excess.

Queens Park Rangers' Joey Barton is one of football's most prolific self-promoting 'characters'

Football has travelled some way along that path, with a turgid cast of self-promoting ‘characters’, along with talkSPORT, Robbie Savage, Joey Barton, and lashings of banal banter from mirthless celebs.

A wonderful game, intelligently administered, yet selling itself short by embracing embarrassing distractions.

As for professional boxing, it long ago abandoned any ambition to be treated as serious sport. The fighters themselves remain wonderful athletes and admirable people, but the sad old game is now a branch of showbusiness, with its ring-walks and its trash-talk, its scripted threats and its phony feuds.

The sport which once gave us Ali and Frazier now offers Bermane Stiverne and Deontay Wilder, not to mention Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora. The well is dry, the end is a matter of time.

If all this should sound unremittingly bleak, then the impression is false. Despite the dreary drip of resentful criticism, the 2012 Olympics left our sport in a healthier, more confident condition.

Despite an unprecedented number of counter-attractions, sport at large — and most prominently the crown jewel sport of cycling — is fighting the good fight for attention and participation.

Those of us who stood on the packed pavements to watch the Tour de France speed through the glories of the Yorkshire countryside will testify that the British respond to genuine sporting events like no other nation. We remain hopelessly in thrall to sport, yet that sport must be valid, authentic, untainted by contrivance.

And that is why Anderson’s remark was so concerning. For there is no right to abuse, no licence to insult. The belief such behaviour is ‘quite entertaining’ is the cod philosophy of the professional wrestling ring.

It is a great pity, for English cricket is currently facing all manner of demanding problems. Jimmy Anderson has made their solution no easier.

Neville’s reputation dented by his drivel

By the knee-jerk standards of television punditry, Gary Neville is a serious man. But even serious men can be swept away by the pressure to transform the mundane into something guaranteed to start an argument in the pub.

Hence his reaction when an Everton footballer named Kevin Mirallas became involved in a foolish spat with his colleague and designated penalty taker, Leighton Baines, over who should take a penalty in the match with West Bromwich. Having insisted on taking the kick, Mirallas missed it, thereby costing his team two crucial points.

Now we can probably agree that Mirallas is an irksome clown, that Baines is more docile than an England defender ought to be and that the Everton captain Phil Jagielka has the leadership qualities of a garden gnome.

Gary Neville described Mirallas' decision to take the penalty as a 'despicable breach of team orders'

Jamie Carragher said Everton's senior players should have intervened and told Mirallas to let Baines take it

But that did not go nearly far enough for our Gary. It was, he said, ‘a scandal’. ‘One of the most despicable breaches of team spirit you can possibly have. You do not do that at any cost!’ And there was more. ‘It doesn’t get much worse,’ said Neville. ‘You can punch someone, you can go over the top and break someone’s leg, which is unnecessary, in a tackle, but to go against team orders in the dressing room is terrible. It’s one of the worst things you can do.’

The entire diatribe was delivered with an heroically straight face.

Yet Neville was talking the kind of nonsense he would have mocked without mercy in his days as a player. Does he seriously believe that snapping an opponent’s leg is merely ‘unnecessary’, but taking a penalty against orders is scandalous, selfish and despicable? Of course not.

But Sky Sports is never knowingly undersold, so he delivered his drivel in apocalyptic tones, while the suits in the studio stared on in mute approval.

Next time controversy comes along, we must hope that Neville resists the lure of amateur dramatics. For he is a serious man, with points to make and things to say.

And now, a reputation to retrieve.

P.S.

He has a formidable record at major football clubs. He also enjoys an imperious air, a disdainful stare and a way with an empty platitude. And yet, his tactics appear to bewilder his own players and his team is frequently sterile and unappealing. If he possessed an ordinary name — something like ‘David Moyes’, perhaps — the manager of Manchester United might be under a great deal of pressure. Instead, his name is Louis van Gaal and he is currently immune from criticism. He really ought to make the most of the truce. For it may not last. 

Louis van Gaal has hardly fared any better than David Moyes but has so far been immune from criticism
