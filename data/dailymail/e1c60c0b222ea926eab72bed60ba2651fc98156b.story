The father-daughter duo who have been the focus of national attention since he shot her laptop, following a Facebook rant against her parents’ chore demands, seem to have come to a truce.

Speaking out about the incident for the first time, Tommy Jordan's daughter Hannah Marie tersely admitted to learning her lesson.

‘We
got home, we talked about it, and then we went our separate ways for a 
little while but we came back together but we were laughing about it 
soon afterwards,’ she said Wednesday morning.

The whole gang: Hannah's mother and Tommy's wife Amy (left) joined the pair on the show and said that they talked about the shooting before he did it, deciding it was a good way to show how internet postings can go viral

‘I think he overreacted a little bit but I understand.’

Mr Jordan and his daughter appeared on
the Today show this morning talking about how their lives have changed 
since he videotaped himself shooting off a round of his .45 at the 
center of her laptop one month ago.

Though he believes that what he did 
was right and he stands by his decision, he did express some slight 
remorse on presenting his parenting lesson on such a public stage rather
than simply within the confines of their family.

‘Possibly in hindsight, considering all of the(Children’s Protective Services) and (Division of Social Services) involvement in that kind of stuff, maybe that was the right thing to do,’ Mr Jordan told interviewer Matt Lauer.

‘However I can't change that I did what I did and I stood behind what I did and I still do.’

Mr Jordan said how he has received anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 emails in response to the incident, as it has sparked public outcry and support from fellow parents.

Tense truce: Tommy Jordan and his daughter Hannah Marie talked about how she is still grounded and does not have a new computer

Angry: Tommy Jordan, of Albemarle, North Carolina, reads out his 15-year-old daughter Hannah's grumbling Facebook post in which she complains about having to do chores at home

Aim: Mr Jordan gets out his pistol to shoot the

starts to fire at it, right, shooting nine bullets including one from 
Hannah's mother

‘There's more good mail then bad mail, but there is a large amount of bad mail,’ he lamented.

‘I have an email folder called good, bad, and press.’

Still in trouble: Hannah Marie appeared on the Today Show but was mostly quiet and kept her answers short

Since
the video has become viral, Mr Jordan has written a series of posts on 
his Facebook page, saying that he’s not an awesome parent, just a 
‘normal guy with a reasonable moral compass that I try very hard to keep
pointed North.’

The incident started when his 15-year-old daughter posted a scathing rant on her Facebook page that complained about the chores she was made to do- like making her bed and emptying the dishwasher.

While she hid the rant from her groups
labelled Family and Church, her father saw it when he posted a funny 
photo of the family dog on the profile that they have for the animal.

On
the Today show, Mr Jordan and his wife Amy said that they were 
consciously trying to make a point about how careful their daughter- and
children in general- have to be when they post things online.

‘That's
the point: a lot of what we were trying to make with her in the 
beginning was don't post anything on the web that you don't want the 
entire world to see and that's one of the reasons why we were upset with
her in the first place,’ Mrs Jordan said.

To date, the video of Mr Jordan shooting her laptop has been viewed over 31 million times on YouTube.

‘I think all of this has driven the point home,’ Mrs Jordan continued.

Irreparable: He shoots nine bullets into the computer, which he tells Hannah she will have to pay for as well

Crumpled: After reading his daughter's rant bemoaning her chores, Mr Jordan crumpled the paper in his hand

The message in question: Tommy Jordan sat in a wooden chair with his daughter's rant and read it in its entirety

Hannah is still grounded and still does not have a new laptop, but that is all a part of the lesson that her parents were trying to show her.

In her original Facebook rant, she complained about how she should get paid for doing her chores and that her parents always want her to get a job. Though they did not address the money issue directly, it seems unlikely that it changed.

To prove that he did not act purely out of rage, Mr Jordan surprised Hannah with her hard drive on the morning show.

‘I didn't just go out there and empty an entire clip into my kids laptop, there was a little bit of thought in it,’ he said.

While she did not seem over the moon about the fact that she still had all of her data and photos, that was surely part of the lesson too.

To my parents,

I'm not your damn slave. It's not my responsibility to clean up your s**t. We have a cleaning lady for a reason. Her name is Linda, not Hannah.

If you want coffee, get off your ass and get it yourself. If you want a garden, shovel the fertiliser yourself, don't sit back on your ass and watch me do it. If you walk in the house and get mud all over the floor that I just cleaned, be my guest, but clean it up after you are done getting s**t everywhere.

I'm tired of picking up after you. You tell me at least once a day that I need to get a job. You could just pay me for all the s**t that I do around the house. Every day when I get home from school, I have to do dishes, clean the counter tops, all the floors, make all the beds, do the laundry and get the trash. I'm not even going to mention all the work I do around your clinic.

And if I don't do all that every day, I get grounded. Do you know how hard it is to keep up with chores and schoolwork? It's freaking crazy.

I go to sleep at 10 o'clock every night because I am too tired to stay up any longer and do anything else. I have to get up at five in the morning, to get ready for school. On the weekends, I have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother won't come get me up at six.

I'm tired of this bulls**t. Next time I have to pour a cup of coffee, I'm going to flip s**t. I have no idea how I have a life. I'm going to hate to see the day when you get too old to wipe your ass and you call me, asking for help. I won't be there.

Signed, Your Pissed Kid, Hannah
