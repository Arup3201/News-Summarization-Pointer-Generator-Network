Former England full back Delon Armitage has been handed a three-month ban for verbally abusing Leicester fans during Toulon's European Cup defeat at Welford Road 11 days ago.

Armitage, a serial offender who has received a previous ban for abusing a doping official and has a catalogue of on-field misconduct charges, contested the charge but was found guilty by a three man disciplinary panel.

The panel found inconsistencies in his evidence.

Toulon full-back Delon Armitage has been suspended for 12 weeks following a misconduct complaint

The incident occurred duing Toulon's 25-21 loss to Leicester at Welford Road 11 days ago  

He would have only received an eight week ban if he had a clean record but the former London Irish star found his poor disciplinary record counted against him.

'The misconduct complaint against Armitage was that during and after the match he was alleged to have conducted himself in an unsportsmanlike manner by making a number of comments to, or within earshot of, spectators using foul and abusive language and may have brought into disrepute the sport of rugby union, the European Rugby Champions Cup, other clubs and persons and/or EPCR in contravention of the Disciplinary Rules of the European Rugby Champions Cup Participation Agreement 2014/15,' A statement read.

'After considering evidence and hearing submissions on behalf of Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, and on behalf of the EPCR Disciplinary Officer, the independent Disciplinary Committee was not satisfied that a comment allegedly made by Armitage during the match had been made as the inconsistencies in the evidence were too great.

'However, the Committee was satisfied that Armitage had directed abusive language at Leicester Tigers supporters after the match, and while it found that his comments were provoked, the Committee decided he was guilty of misconduct.

'The Committee determined that the sanction entry point should be eight weeks, and as this was Armitage's second post-match misconduct case in the last four years, and as there were no mitigating factors, it decided to add four weeks to the ban before imposing a suspension of 12 weeks. Armitage was also ordered to pay costs.'
