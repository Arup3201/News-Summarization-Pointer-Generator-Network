The relentless snow and winter storms sweeping the country will continue into March after one of the coldest months in history.

Dozens of states will be hit by yet another Arctic blast over the weekend and into next week with meteorologists predicting almost everywhere east of the Rockies will experience temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees below average, and on Saturday there is snow expected in all 50 states, something that has not happened since the second week of February in 2010.

And with many bodies of water on or near the Eastern seaboard freezing over, the U.S. Coast Guard has been forced to deploy ice breakers to clear shipping lanes in the Hudson Valley and the Delaware River in Philadelphia. 

In Wisconsin meanwhile, conditions have allowed for the creation of beautiful ice caves, as the water trickling down the caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore on lake Superior freezes over.

Meanwhile, parts of the East and the Midwest will be hit with sub-zero conditions so severe that more daily records are, yet again, set to tumble.

The mercury has dropped so low that three of the five Great Lakes have completely frozen over.  

As February draws to a close, records will likely show it is the fifth coldest on record for swathes of the east coast, according to ABC. 

In Detroit, the month is expected to be the second coldest since records began in 1874. Temperatures in the Michigan city dropped to 14.6 degrees on Wednesday. The record was set in 1875, according to the Detroit News. 

With below freezing temperatures forecast for the remainder of the month, Chicago is set to beat the record for the coldest February set in the same year.

The Weather Channel's Michael Palmer told NBC: 'We're almost into March now so it's pretty late to see this kind of cold. The cold this February has been brutal, and there doesn't look like there will be any let-up until late next week.'

At 4am ET on Friday, the mercury had already dropped below zero in North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa. The frigid conditions are set to move towards the eastern seaboard as the day goes on with freezing conditions predicted in the Midwest and Great Lakes.

According to ABC Syracuse, New York, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Bangor, Maine, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and New York City could have a top-three coldest February on record if the temperature continues to drop. 

The only areas getting snow early Friday were Oklahoma, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Another band of snow was forecast to hit the Midwest on Saturday and shift into the Northeast on Sunday.

The snow in Alabama has also delayed jury selection in the capital murder trial of a woman accused of making her granddaughter run until she died.

Some roads were still icy in northeast Alabama around Etowah County early Friday, and officials say Joyce Hardin Garrard's trial won't get started until Monday as a precaution.

Authorities say Garrard forced nine-year-old Savannah Hardin to run for hours as punishment for a lie three years ago. The girl eventually collapsed and died days later in a hospital. The defense says Garrard is innocent.

Attorneys were first supposed to begin questioning jurors in court on Wednesday, but the judge postponed the session because of winter weather. The same thing happened Thursday when snow blanketed the county. 

On Thursday most of the country had a break from the snow - despite storms earlier in the week forcing schools, roads and businesses to close.

Thousands of people in the Carolinas, Virginia, Alabama and Georgia were also left without power as falling trees knocked down power lines. 

This is the third storm to hit the Deep South in less than a week. Since the storms began, airlines have been severely affected, canceling nearly 7,000 flights in the past seven days. For Thursday, more than 1,300 flights had been canceled nationwide and another 4,400 delayed, according to tracking site FlightAware.com.

By 11.45 on Friday, more than 4,000 flights had already been affected - 399 were cancelled and 1,049 delayed. 

Huntsville, Alabama, received 8.1 inches on Wednesday, breaking a daily record. It was also the snowiest February day and the second snowiest day of any month on record there.
