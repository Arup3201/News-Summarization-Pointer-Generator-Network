This sequence of never-before-seen photographs shows the Challenger space shuttle disaster from a dramatic new perspective as it explodes over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven crew on board.

They were uncovered by a Reddit user who was sorting through the attic of his recently deceased grandmother nearly 30 years after the tragedy.

American Mustache, who posted the photos, says they were given to his NASA-contractor grandfather by a co-worker and despite all efforts, he hasn't found pictures from the same angle.

Countdown to disaster: The Challenger Shuttle took off for the ninth and last time on January 28, 1986

New perspective: Reddit user American Mustache posted a series of never before seen photos  that document the Challenger disaster from beginning to end on Tuesday

Once hopeful: America was full of hope as the very symbol of the space age achieved liftoff and began its ascent towards the vast cosmos

America watched: The launch appeared to go smoothly at first, a launch which American Mustache says he witnessed on television from his fourth grade classroom

Something amiss: As seconds continued to pass, unusual changes in the smoke plume and pitch of the shuttle made it progressively clearer to layman viewers that something was amiss

The shots capture the tragedy 
beginning to end: from the anxious yet hopeful moments before take-off 
through to the devastating end when all that's left of the once-mighty 
spacecraft is a lingering plume of smoke off the Florida coast.

'My grandfather worked for NASA as a contractor for years,' writes American Mustache.

'So he got to see just about every launch. His
 friend was the one who took these shots.

'He gave him a copy of the 
prints and somehow they got mixed in and forgot about for years until I 
found them the other day.'

Doomed from the start: NASA experts who witnessed the disaster saw things the untrained eye could not. The color and size of the smoke indicated there were serious problems just seconds after takeoff

All too real: The extent of the tragedy became all too clear as the smoke plume grew ever large and then was seen to envelope Challenger itself (left)

Horrifying: Fuel tanks began to jet away in opposite directions spewing white vapor and leaving behind a startling pyrotechnic display

All seven Challenger crewmembers - 
Christa McAuliffe, Michael J. Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison
 Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik - perished in the disaster 
on January 28, 1986.

The 
launch had received particular attention because of the inclusion of 
McAuliffe, the first member of the Teacher in Space Project, after she 
beat 11,000 candidates to the coveted role.

The
 unique trip, where she planned to teach American students from space, 
gained the program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had
 an immediate rapport with the media.

But
 the excitement quickly turned to horror when the shuttle exploded about
 10 miles in the air, leaving a trail debris falling back to earth.

Rest in peace: The seven astronauts who died onboard were Francis R. Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Gregory B. Jarvis, Christa McAuliffe, Judith A. Resnik, Ellison S. Onizuka and Ronald E. McNair

All was lost that January day as the shattered remains of the Space Shuttle Challenger plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean

Everything changed: The immense explosion was seared in the minds of a generation of Americans who would no longer see NASA and its once-inspiring Space Shuttle program the same way again

The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks.

The
 shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts, but it became known 
later that at least several of those on board survived the initial 
explosion.

Then-president 
Ronald Regan ordered a probe into the Challenger catastrophe, where it 
was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were 
said to have played a role in the accident.

Grounded: The smoke would soon settle, but it would be two years before the pioneers at NASA would again take to the skies in a Space Shuttle

It
 resulted in a nearly three-year lapse in NASA's shuttle program, with 
the next shuttle, Discovery, taking off on September 29, 1988.

NASA
 ended the shuttle program for good last year, retiring the remaining 
vessels and instead opting for multimillion-dollar rides on Russian 
Soyuz capsules to get U.S. astronauts to the International Space 
Station.

Private U.S. companies hope to help fill the gap, beginning with space station cargo and then, hopefully, astronauts.

In their honour: The Challenger Memorial Plaque at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, in memory of the seven crew members who died in the 1986 disaster

Challenger was one of NASA's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies.

It was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle, but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft.

In its heyday, it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut.

But it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off.

Roger Boisjoly, a NASA contractor at 
rocket-builder Morton Thiokol Inc, warned in 1985 that seals on the 
booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures.

'The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order — loss of human life,' he wrote in a memo.

On
 the eve of the ill-fated flight, Boisjoly and several colleagues 
reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of 
predicted cold weather at the Kennedy Space Center. 

But they were overruled by Morton Thiokol managers, who gave NASA the green light.

After the accident, Boisjoly testified to a presidential commission investigating the Challenger accident. 

The
 group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the 
booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of 
the shuttle's hydrogen fuel.

Boisjoly died in 2012 aged 73.
