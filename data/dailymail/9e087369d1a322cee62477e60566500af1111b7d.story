A former monk hanged himself in the Catholic church where he worshipped after becoming convinced he was possessed by demons, an inquest heard today.

Dominic Bell, 47, was found dead at St John the Evangelist Church in Horsham, West Sussex, shortly after telling psychiatrists he needed to harm himself to save his loved ones.

The devoted Catholic had been a regular worshipper at the church, attending confession in the run up to his death. His body was found by a young parishioner who had gone to the church to pray.

An inquest heard today how Mr Bell had lived as a monk and head gardener at an historic monastery on the Isle of Wight before returning to the family home in Horsham.

His emotional mother, Julia James, told the inquest that her son was a ‘gentle child’ who had spiralled into depression after getting into financial difficulties and being declared bankrupt.

It was then that he turned to religion and travelled to Quarr Abbey to become a monk and decided to take a job as head gardener and tended the monastery’s manicured grounds for a decade.

She told the coroner that, after becoming disillusioned with monastery life, her son briefly moved to the Orkney Islands but this left him feeling depressed and ‘in need of support.’

The inquest jury heard that after returning to live with his mother he would take to his room for long periods and she regularly heard him crying.

Shortly afterwards he left home and stabbed himself in the chest in an apparent suicide attempt, telling her: ‘You need to let me go.’

The worshipper was sectioned under the Mental Health Act in September 2013 and detained at Langley Green Hospital in Crawley, where he was said to be a quiet but popular figure who got on well with other patients.

However the jury heard that Mr Bell, who was subsequently released on the basis that he would continue to live at the hospital voluntarily, walked out on day leave on the morning of January 2 this year and was found dead at the church seven hours later.

Student worshipper Andrew Penson described the moment be made the discovery, saying be entered the church and approached the font before turning around and seeing the body of a man hanging.

Psychiatrist Dr Mihaela Bucur told the hearing in Horsham today: ‘He didn’t have any insight into what was going on in his life. He thought everything was real and that he was possessed by demons.

‘He said that he wanted to protect people around him by hurting himself. He thought that he had to hurt himself because at that point he thought he was evil and he was doing bad things to people around him.’

However she said Mr Bell had shown significant improvements in the three weeks before his death and that staff had believed he was no longer psychotic or depressed.

A jury concluded that Mr Bell died of self-inflicted injuries but that his intention that day was unclear.

Assistant Coroner for West Sussex Michael Burgess said: ‘I’m sure he will be remembered for the better moments in his life rather than how he died.’
