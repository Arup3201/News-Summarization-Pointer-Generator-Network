Time stops for no man - but it appears that horologists will force it to wait just a little on Saturday.

Timekeepers will add an extra second to the last minute of June 30 to compensate for Earth's movements.

The 'extra' second is vital to keep 
clocks on Earth in sync with 'solar time', so that our days and nights 
match up to light and darkness.

Time on Earth is measured using atomic clocks, and has to be adjusted to keep pace with Earth's wobbly orbits.

Standing still: Timekeepers will make a minute last 61 seconds on Saturday

Coordinated Universal Time is manually adjusted ever so often to keep pace with the Earth's slightly irregular orbit - and has been since the Seventies.

Universal Time - agreed to be the global standard time - is used to set PCs and phones around the world.

More crucially, it also ensures GPS devices can navigate accurately.

Time on Earth is 'counted' by a network of 400 atomic clocks and 
sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night, due to 
fluctuations in earth's rotation.

Atomic
clocks measure time to incredibly precise accuracy by measuring 
vibrations caused by the decay of radioactive particles to count the 
seconds.

The planet takes just over 86,400 seconds for a 360 degree revolution.

But it wobbles on its axis and is affected by the pull of the Sun, Moon and tides meaning it gets out of step with International Atomic Time (TAI).

To avoid solar time and TAI moving too far apart, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is adjusted to give us the odd 86,401 - second day.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has,
since the Seventies, been the agreed universal standard which dictates 
what time it is in every time zone on the planet.

The speed of the 
Earth's rotation varies, however, meaning that while one rotation is one
day, some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others.

Scientists
allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every 
year-and-a-half to keep UTC synchronised with our traditional, sun-based
concept of time.

They are 
added once the International Earth Rotation Service, which monitors the 
planet's activity, finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart
by 0.9 seconds.

Under threat: The U.S. wants to move to a new man-made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky, rendering sundials useless

Leap-second: It won't mean much of a lie in but Saturday night will be a second longer than usual

'Today, time is constructed defined and measured with atomic clocks' said Noel Dimarcq, director of the SYRTE time-space reference system at the Paris Observatory.

'This allows us to ensure that everyone on Earth is on the exact same time.'
