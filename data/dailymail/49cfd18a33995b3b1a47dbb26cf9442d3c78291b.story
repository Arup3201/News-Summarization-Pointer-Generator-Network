America's most hated mother Casey Anthony wants to escape Florida and move to Costa Rica as soon as her probation ends this summer, it has been claimed.

The 26-year-old was found not guilty of the murder of her two-year-old daughter 
Caylee 10 months ago, despite a string of inconsistencies in her trial 
defence.

She is serving a year of probation after admitting she stole a friend's check book and wrote out five checks for $644.35 - but when it ends later this summer she hopes to escape to Central America.

'Casey is counting the days until her 
probation ends,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She has been researching countries that she could move 
to and Costa Rica is at the top of the list.'

She's back: Sporting short, blonde hair and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognisable on the October YouTube diary she filmed. She is now hoping to escape to Costa Rica when her probation is complete

The country's warm weather and low cost of living appeals to the woman who has spent months in hiding in her South Florida home since the acquittal, the source added.

'She 
wants to put as much distance as possible from Florida... and 
she feels this is the best place to start a new life,' the source said.

Sources have already claimed that Anthony is restless, as she has been going out regularly - yet she has put on so much weight she is not recognisable.

After her dramatic acquittal, she has
spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the 
computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds.

But a source has revealed that this 
new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh 
courage as she has been leaving her home regularly.

'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.'

The source added that she has turned 
to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food 
from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long.

'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added.

It comes after a source told People magazine that Casey remains unemployed and has little money, while probation reports show she recently stopped attending counseling sessions.

However, she has apparently started 
speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their 
relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father.

Anthony
is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at 
the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted a 
defamation subpoena.

She is being sued by Zenaida
Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter Anthony initially told police had kidnapped her daughter. Anthony admitted
fabricating that story.

Gone: Anthony's toddler daughter Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008

Anthony had been planning to leave 
Florida after her probation ends in August but this new court order 
means she will have to stay.

The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.'

But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video 
diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes
for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Anthony is being sued by Zenaida
Gonzalez, who shares the name of 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony 
initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating
that story.

It later emerged that Anthony, whose 
acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, 
did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a
nanny.

Now Miss 
Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due 
to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was 
found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release.

Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

Hidden: Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction.

But, as Anthony had not been seen in 
public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and 
decided to track her down.

They
staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be 
served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and 
said she would attend the court hearing.

'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine.

'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'
