Former champion jockey Jamie Spencer has made the surprise announcement that he will retire at the end of the season to take up a full-time role in the Qatar Racing management team.

Spencer, 34, will continue to ride for Qatar Racing for the remainder of the year before embarking on his new career in January 2015. Qatar racing have around 250 horses in training around the world.

Spencer said: 'This is a fantastic opportunity and if I have learned anything in my riding career it is that you should take such opportunities when they come along.

The end: Jamie Spencer revealed he will retire from racing at the end of the current season 

'As much as I love race riding, it is not something I want to do for the rest of my life and while I am not necessarily ready to retire now, I feel at a stage when I am ready for a change.

'I really enjoy being part of the Qatar Racing team, working with Sheikh Fahad, (racing manager) David [Redvers] and everyone in the team, and so the opportunity to continue that and at the same time start the next chapter in my career appealed to me.

'This has been a big decision and not one I have taken lightly. My priority is my family, and thinking of them and their future has played a key part in my decision. I feel I still have a lot to give to racing, and not just as a jockey.

'I would like to thank all the owners and trainers who have supported me throughout my career. I will always be grateful to them for the success I have had and the friendships built along the way.'

Sheik Fahad, the man behind Qatar racing, said: 'I am delighted that Jamie will remain part of the team in his new role. I very much enjoy working with him and I am sure he will continue to be a great asset to Qatar Racing.'

Spencer, who spent a season as stable jockey to Aidan O'Brien, was champion jockey in 2005 and then shared the title with Se Sanders in 2007.

He burst on to the scene and won the 1998 Irish 1,000 Guineas on Tarascon when only 17-years-old.

One of his biggest wins in Britain came in the 2009 Oaks on Michael Bell-trained Sariska. He also won the 2011 Ascot Gold Cup on O'Brien's Fame And Glory.
