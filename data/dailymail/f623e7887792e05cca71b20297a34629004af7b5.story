Nigel Clough's brother Simon has noticed how the Sheffield United manager is subconsciously picking up some of the mannerisms of their legendary dad Brian.

And certainly Brian would have been impressed with his son's cup record with the Bramall Lane club – 13 wins in 16 ties after taking another Premier League scalp Southampton on Tuesday night.

Clough Sr famously won the league championship with Derby County and Nottingham Forest, and his cup record wasn't too bad either.

He won the European Cup and League Cup twice each with Nottingham Forest – Nigel played in both League Cup triumphs – although 'Old Big 'Ead' never lifted the FA Cup despite reaching the final in 1991.

Some of that knockout magic has clearly rubbed off on Clough Jr.

Earlier this year he took League One Blades to the FA Cup semi-final, defeating Premier League Fulham and Aston Villa on the way before losing 5-3 to Hull City in a thriller at Wembley.

This season they beat West Ham on penalties at Upton Park and a Marc McNulty goal was enough to beat the Premier League's fifth-place side Southampton, whose manager was so upset with Clough's animated presence on the touchline, he refused to shake hands with him afterwards.

Certainly, Clough Jnr doesn't adhere to his father's rule of never criticising or berating officials. But he would be proud to see the way his son, who he fetchingly referred to as 'our No 9' at Forest, can maximise the talents of his players.

Brian signed a striker called Gary Birtles for £2,000 from Long Eaton and used him to win the European Cup. Nigel signed a striker called Che Adams from Ilkeston Town and gave him his debut against Southampton as a half-time substitute.

Brian transformed Kenny Burns' career by converting him from centre-forward to centre-half, Nigel played right-winger Ryan Flynn at right-back against Southampton to cope with injuries and the loss of cup-tied players, and it worked.

Clough believed that if a player was good enough he was old enough. Clough had no hesitation in starting with 17-year-old Louis Reed on Tuesday and he didn't look out of place against established Premier League players Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama.

Bramall Lane was bouncing with the Clough effect – a sop to any club that doesn't take domestic cup competitions seriously.

'It was a remarkable effort by the players, and the supporters too,' said Clough. 'We try to go for it in every game.

'Nights like this are special. I was talking to (Southampton coach) Sammy Lee, he knows as a former Liverpool player that you don't want to come to a place like this when everything is buzzing.

Brian would have been proud. Just cut out the backchat to the officials!
