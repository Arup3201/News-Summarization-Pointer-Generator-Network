Brazil World Cup chiefs are jubilant at the end of the group stage as to how well the tournament has gone, on and off the pitch.

But despite the triumphant attitude of sports minister Aldo Rebelo and Ricardo Trade, CEO of the organising committee, at the FIFA briefing, there are serious concerns within the IOC at Rio’s behind-schedule preparations for the 2016 Olympics.

The fear is that rushing to complete a huge construction project — temporary and permanent — will lead to safety issues, with Brazil’s building and planning controls not nearly as rigorous as London 2012’s.

A roaring success: Aldo Rebelo (right) celebrates alongside Prince Harry as Neymar scores for Brazil against Cameroon... but will the Olympics be such a success?

Volunteers are also seen as a big problem, with worries inside the IOC over ensuring that the 70,000 temporary workforce turn up every day. Then there is the problem of traffic chaos in Rio that will be even worse when the obligatory Olympic lanes are installed.

Rio has coped with the traffic issue during the World Cup by making every match day in the city a public holiday. But that cannot be done for 16 successive days of Olympic sport.

The biggest panic is among international sport federations — many of whom are due to hold test events in Rio next year, with facilities nowhere near complete.

A Rio 2016 spokesman said they are looking forward to giving a full update on progress to the IOC Coordination Commission on their next visit at the end of September. And they have promised to give a million Brazilians the opportunity to learn a second language. This will include all those who apply to be volunteers, whether or not they are accepted.

Complaints: Phil Neville was slammed for his co-commentary debut

Phil Neville has been given no opportunity by the BBC to remedy his nightmare, monotone debut as co-commentator in the England v Italy match in Manaus, for which he was widely castigated and which saw the Beeb swamped with 445 complaints.

Neville, who is going home tomorrow, is a studio pundit for the Brazil v Chile first-pick, last-16 game, with Martin Keown in the co-commentator role.

The BBC would not commit to whether Neville would have remained as co-com if England had stayed in the tournament.

Probably not.

The fall-out from the Luis Suarez biting incident is set to run for the rest of the summer.

The Uruguayan FA are not likely to receive any reduction in the Suarez sentence from the FIFA appeals committee.

But the next step will be to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who temporarily overturned Mohamed bin Hammam’s lifetime ban from football for lack of evidence.

After that, there is the Swiss Federal Tribunal, who called FIFA’s banning of Brazilian midfielder Matuzalem following a breach-of-contract row with Shakhtar Donetsk ‘fundamentally unlawful.’

Sepp Blatter’s unilateral decision to spend £16million on his FIFA history film United Passions has not been reflected in box-office interest.

It is understood only Portugal and Serbia have taken up Blatter’s vanity project, which FIFA say will get another airing at the Zurich film festival.

Vanity Project: Sepp Blatter's film has not received universal popularity

Meanwhile, FIFA somehow deny that Blatter is purposely being kept away from appearing on the big screen during matches to avoid being booed.

When asked why the cameras focused only on German Chancellor Angela Merkel when she was sitting next to Blatter during the Germany v Portugal match, FIFA secretary Jerome Valcke replied: ‘Maybe the guy on the camera had a preference for Angela Merkel.’

Cruise control: Shane Warne was on a boat around Greece as England lost to Sri Lanka

Shane Warne, the rent-a-quote former Aussie cricketer, has laid into Alastair Cook over his woeful captaincy during England’s defeat by  Sri Lanka at Headingley.

But it emerges that Sky Sports pundit Warne wasn’t at the game at any stage — and was instead on holiday on a boat around Greece for most of the match.

It is also claimed that bon viveur Warne needed to set an alarm to wake him up to do his commentary stints at Lord’s during the first Test against Sri Lanka.

Sky claim Warne had not been partying too hard, is always highly professional and, if he had set an alarm, it would be to remind himself about his commentary slots.
