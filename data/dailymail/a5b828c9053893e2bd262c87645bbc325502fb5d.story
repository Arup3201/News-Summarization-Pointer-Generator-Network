Sydney man Peter Gardner, who has been detained in China on suspicion of drug smuggling for more than three months, is still languishing in a Chinese jail as he awaits a decision on whether his case will go to trial.

New Zealand-born Gardner was arrested on November 8 in Guangzhou, where authorities allege he tried to smuggle 40kg of methamphetamine out of China.

His travelling partner, Sydney woman Kalynda Davis, 22, was released without charge in December after a month in custody.

But Gardner, a 25-year-old from Richmond in northwest Sydney, could face the death penalty.

New Zealand human rights lawyer Craig Tuck has joined Gardner's defence team and will travel to China soon to work with his client's Chinese legal counsel.

'Mr Gardner has had his file transferred from the police to the prosecutor's office,' he said in a statement.

'He is detained in a cell while he awaits the decision about whether or not his case will proceed to trial.

'He is grateful for the love and support of his family and friends in New Zealand and Australia.'

The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds.

When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared because she had carry-on luggage only.

She had been shackled in a small cell during the 30-day interrogation, was allowed no contact with the outside world and had her long, blonde hair cropped. 

But after her month-long imprisonment in a Chinese jail late last year, Ms Davis' life appears to have returned to normal.

Social media photos last month showed Ms Davis enjoying the sunshine, much of it with her best friend Dan Stella, who posted a touching tribute to the friend with which who he shares a 'magical bond' with.

'I'm blessed n thankfull I have this girl back home n in my life, best friends for life (sic)', he wrote earlier this month.

Mr Stella went on to describe the emotion he felt when he discovered he may never see Ms Davis again, saying he felt truly 'blessed' to have her back.

The pair visited Naru Beach in Newcastle together in the first week of 2015, with Ms Davis joking she wanted to forget how sunburnt she was after spending the day in the sun.

Mr Stella likened Ms Davis' return to 'winning the lottery' to which she replied 'love you so much' and 'Makes each time we spend together so much more special'.
