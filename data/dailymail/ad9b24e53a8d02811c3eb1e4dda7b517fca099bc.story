Amanda Bynes has backtracked on her earlier claims that her father mentally physically and even sexually abused her as a child.

The troubled 28-year-old had posted numerous tweets accusing Rick Bynes of inappropriate of fondling himself in front of her.

The actress then - hours after her initial Twitter posts - said her dad never abused her and she only said so because of a 'microchip' in her brain.

Taking the abusive comments back she said: 'My dad never did any of those things. The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me.'

While she took the comments back they had already done a lot of damage with the embattled star's mother Lynn telling Hollyscoop the family was heartbroken.

She said in a statement: 'I am heartbroken today for my husband of 47 years. Rick has been the best father and husband a family can ask for.

'He has never abused Amanda or our other children [Tommy and Julian] physically or sexually. These accusations are absolutely horrible and could not be further from the truth!'

'These allegations stem from Amanda's mental state at the moment. They have no basis in reality. It saddens me beyond belief that my husband's character could be slandered in such a way.'

Amanda's sister Jillian O'Keefe also came out in support of her father, tweeting a picture of herself with her parents saying 'I love  my mom and dad with all my heart.'

Shortly after, the star stopped following her sister on Twitter.

Explaining why she did not want to live with her father and mother in California - where she has been since been released from an inpatient psychiatric facility in December - the actress said on Twitter she could not be in the same house as her father.

The embattled star wrote: 'My dad was verbally and physically abuse to me as a child.

'He called me ugly as a child and then asked me if I wanted to have sex with him and I did not know how to respond and I said no and then.

'I was forced to live with my dad which was a total nightmare.'

Disturbing turn: The 28-year-old went on to describe what she says her father did to her 

A few minutes later her tweets took an even more disturbing turn.

She wrote to her more than 3 million followers: 'My dad fondled himself in front of me so many times that I started recording him on my phone in hopes of catching him...  saying or doing something inappropriate around me so I could get him arrested & put in jail for the rest of his perverted life.'

The star then accused her mother of knowing that her father was abusing her and not stepping in to help.

'My mom knows that my father's literally and physically incestual towards his own daughter and the fact that she never called the police on.'

Their lawyer, Tamar Arminak, told MailOnline: 'My clients are heartbroken by these false accusations. Their older children [Jillian and Tommy] are also horrified at the situation.'

The star said she plans to get her own lawyer to get a restraining order against her father, a respected dentist. 

'Him [sic] embarrasses me to no end.

'So, today I am meeting with a lawyer to get a restraining order against my dad.

'I cannot hear the sound of his incestually charged voice ever again and I'm just being honest.

'I will not be manipulated or brainwashed by anyone anymore. So let me live my own life free of unhappiness and misery.'

Anticipating many will dismiss her claims the star pleaded for her followers to take her seriously.

'So call me what you want but please do not call me crazy or insane because that's a joke.' 

Erratic behaviour: On Friday, video of the star emerged of the star dancing to herself at boutique Pookie & Sebastian emerged two days prior

Amanda's parents are reportedly on their way to New York to try to encourage their daughter into a mental health facility.

TMZ reports in an effort to avoid her parents Amanda has tried to flee the city.

The website reports the star 'first went to LaGuardia to get out of town but was ordered out of the airport after screaming at a ticket agent. She was agitated that a flight wasn't immediately leaving. She then jumped in a car to make her way to JFK.'

On Friday, video of the star also emerged showing her dancing around and behaving unusually at boutique Pookie & Sebastian emerged.

Unable to get it off, the star has to buy the accessory, and leaves still behaving erratically.

Just an hour later, the child star was accused of trying to shoplift from Barneys on New York's Madison Avenue after she reportedly tried to leave wearing a $200 hat that she had not purchased.

The 28-year was allegedly detained by store security but later released, according to TMZ.

Amanda has been struggling with mental illness since last year and is believed to have taken a turn for the worse after she moved out of her parents' home in Thousand Oaks, California, as soon as their conservatorship of her ended August. 

The troubled She's The Man actress was pulled over in the San Fernando Valley, just outside Los Angeles, on September 30 at 4 am and taken into custody, the California Highway Patrol confirmed with MailOnline.

She was cited for being under the influence of a controlled substance while driving her Mercedes-Benz. The 28-year-old star was released at 12 noon that same day on $15,000 bail.

The former child star is set to appear in court on October 23 in Van Nuys.
