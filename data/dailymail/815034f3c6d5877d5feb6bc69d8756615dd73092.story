Spain will have an extra incentive to win their friendly with Holland on Tuesday night, according to Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind.

Blind was part of the Holland side which demolished Spain 5-1 at last summer's World Cup, a result which contributed to the holders exiting the competition at the group stage.

Vicente del Bosque's men travel to Amsterdam to face Holland again - in a game which will be broadcast live on MUTV - and Blind believes they will be out for revenge.

Speaking to MUTV ahead of the game, Blind said: 'It's always nice to play against big teams like Spain. We know it will be difficult and a totally different game to the one at the World Cup.

'I would have some revenge feelings if I lost against a team too! That wouldn't only be after a game at the World Cup though. If you lose against any team you always want to win the next time you play them. So I think they will have those feelings.'

Blind could come up against  David de Gea on Tuesday and he is well aware how tough it will be to beat his in-form United team-mate.

'David is doing a great job here this season. He's one of the best keepers in the world at the moment. We're very happy that he's in the goal and he has made some great saves,' added Blind. 

'All the credit goes to him. He works very hard and is getting better all the time.

'His shot-stopping is one of his best skills but you also have to look at how he plays [with his feet] and how he comes for crosses - the way he has improved that is very impressive.

'He has got better in every way. The skills when he is saving goals and also the skills with his feet - they make him an all-round keeper and that's one of the best things about him.'

Daley Blind is set to face David De Gea's Spain with the Netherlands tonight. Fans can watch the game exclusively live only on MUTV in the UK and Ireland. Coverage from 19:30, kick off 19:45.
