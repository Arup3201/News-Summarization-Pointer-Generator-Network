When Moonlight the cat went missing almost nine years ago, his distraught owners tried everything to find him, before giving him up for dead six months later.

But now the beloved pet has been reunited with owner Rosie Collier, 52,  after turning up at a vet's surgery two miles away from her house in Chediston, Suffolk, earlier this week.

Mrs Collier, who lives with husband John, and 17-year-old daughter Melba, says the beloved animal is now back living with them and their other pets. 

Moonlight initially disappeared while staying with Mrs Collier's parents, Denise and Chris, in Wenhaston, while Mrs Collier was on holiday.

Mrs Collier said Moonlight went missing nine years ago while she was on holiday, and the family gave him up for dead after a cat matching his description was found in the road, but he miraculously survived

When she returned the family spent months looking for Moonlight, before a cat matching his description was found dead in the road.

Mrs Collier said the family were 'devastated' at the loss, and even planted a special memorial tree for Moonlight in their back garden.

However, unbeknownst to them, the pet was actually alive, and is believed to have survived wild on a nearby heath, hunting and killing his own food.

Believing he was a neighbour's cat, a female animal-lover in the village occasionally fed Moonlight whenever he stopped by, but took him to the vet after noticing he had lost some fur.

When the cat got there, medics discovered he had been microchipped, and were able to track down his owners.

Mrs Collier said: 'I simply couldn’t believe it - it’s just miraculous! I was just so surprised, I really did not expect to ever get good old Moonlight back.

'I was in shock at first but then I had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day.'

The news was particularly exciting for Melba, who was just eight at the time the cat went missing, and was distraught over losing him.

Mrs Collier explained: 'There were buckets of tears. Melba was very distressed, even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic.'

But rather than inform her daughter straight away, Mrs Collier waited until Melba, who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday, returned from Bungay college that evening to break the news.

Mrs Collier believes Moonlight was living wild on a nearby heath, eating whatever he could catch. A female animal-lover also fed him scraps, and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing

Melba said: 'I was just really shocked. Eight years is a really long time and so I was not expecting it at all - it’s just so good to have our Moonlight back after all this time.'

After a cautious reintroduction to Echo, the family’s golden retriever, and two new pets, Tilly the black labrador and Dusty the cat, Moonlight is happier than ever.

Mrs Collier said: 'I was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us.

'He obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog.' 

'We always knew he was a good hunter, so if he was alive he would probably be OK looking after himself.

'We think he must have been living wild on the heath near here, killing rabbits and mice, but also taking advantage of people who would feed him.

'We are just so happy to have Moonlight back - it’s a genuine miracle.'

Vet Jenny Reason, who discovered Moonlight was microchipped, added: 'When a missing pet turns up, it’s usually a matter of days, sometimes a little longer, but I’ve never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years.

'It’s a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it’s so absolutely vital to chip your pet.'
