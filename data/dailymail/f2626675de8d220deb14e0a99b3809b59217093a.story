Demands: Cecilia Giménez wants Santuario de Misericordia Church, near Zaragoza, to hand over a share of the thousands of euros

The Spanish 80-year-old whose DIY restoration ruined a 19th-century work of art is suing the church where it hangs after her hapless handiwork became an unlikely cash cow.

Cecilia Giménez wants Santuario de Misericordia Church, near Zaragoza, to hand over a share of the thousands of euros it has earned in admission fees since her disastrous decoration job became a tourist attraction.

And she is also instructing a legal team to explore copyrighting her rough and ready renovation to retain future profits, reports national television station TVE.

The octogenarian sparked widespread 
outrage in August when she marched, oil brush and paint in hand, into 
the tiny church in the town of Borja and daubed over Elías García 
Martínez’s Ecce Homo (Behold the Man) without permission.

The
 120-year-old fresco of Jesus Christ wearing a crown of thorns was 
terrifyingly transformed into what many have said now looks like a 
monkey.

She was 
labelled insane and the worldwide attention reportedly brought on a 
series of panic attacks, but she insisted throughout that the church’s 
priest had allowed her to repair the piece.

Locals
 were horrified and, to add insult to injury, it emerged that a local 
Catholic cultural foundation had earlier received money from Martínez’s 
granddaughter, Teresa Garcia Blanc, to restore the crumbling damp-ridden
 fresco to its former glory.

But Giménez’s sloppy workmanship has 
ended up as a mixed blessing for the church that, despite being mocked 
across the world, has seen a huge upsurge in the number of visitors.

It
 was to prevent what town Mayor Miguel Arilla described as ‘disruptive 
pilgrims’ from overtaking the area that the Santi Spiritus Hospital 
Foundation, the church’s owners, started charging a €1 entrance fee.

And Ecce Mono, or Behold the Monkey as it has now jokingly been called, made more than €2,000 in just the first four days.

A
 staggering 30,000 visitors are said to have passed through the doors 
since August, but the fee was only introduced on Saturday. The current 
total of ‘gate receipts’ is not known.

Spokesman José María Aznar told El 
Correo newspaper: ‘Out of 20 people who came in, only one person put in 
any money, so we decided to introduce an admission fee.

‘Although, despite that, it’s true that one day we also had someone who dropped in a €50 note.’

And
 visitor Carmen Udaeta said: ‘As we were in the area, we thought we’d go
 and see the work. It’s true that before all this we never knew, or had 
heard of, or even knew where Borja was.’

The
 interest has led to Giménez and her family hiring lawyers to seek 
royalties, and the Foundation also hiring its own legal team to counter 
the claims.

Since its inception, her ‘art’ has been spoofed by millions across the world with many others seeking to cash in on the calamitous creation.

A Madrid bakery honoured the work by squirting chocolate replicas onto crepes, and it is available to buy as an investment in best-selling EA computer game The Sims.

Several smartphone apps have also sprung up, allowing users to ‘eccehomonise’ themselves by restoring their pictures in a similar style.

And budget airline Ryanair has launched a €12 flight for tourists to travel to Zaragoza from any of their airports to see the ‘creative restoration’.
