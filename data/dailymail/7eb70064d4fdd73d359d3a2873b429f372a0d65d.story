The son of a Florida fertility doctor has pleaded guilty to tricking his pregnant ex-girlfriend into taking a pill that caused her to suffer a miscarriage.

John Welden, 29, faced a judge in Tampa on Monday on charges of tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud after tricking his ex, Remee Jo Lee.

Welden, who faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, will be sentenced on December 5.

Lee, her attorney and federal prosecutors have claimed Welden forged his father's signature on a prescription for Cytotec - which is used to induce labor - and relabeled a pill bottle as 'amoxicillin'.

She lost her seven-week-old fetus after taking the pill.

After the charges against Welden emerged, it was claimed that he gave her the pills so that his other girlfriend, a woman named Tara Fillinger, would not find out about their relationship.

According to evidence filed in federal court, Welden had been dating Fillinger for seven years and had been seeing Lee for about seven months when she fell pregnant.

Fillinger had
become suspicious about their relationship after she found Lee's positive pregnancy test 
and prenatal vitamins in his car. Welden lied and told her that both items 
belonged to his sister.

After the charges against him were filed, Fillinger asked a judge to grant him bail so he could be released. She said they had spoken about getting married and were looking to buy a house together.

Other woman: He was reportedly worried his other girlfriend, Tara Fillinger, would learn of the pregnancy

When Welden was arrested in May, it emerged that Miss Lee had had an ultrasound at the office of his father, Dr Stephen Welden, which 
confirmed she was pregnant.

John
Welden told her his father had prescribed her antibiotics and gave her a
bottle of the abortion drugs.

Miss Lee told authorities she never 
called the doctor's office to confirm the prescription because she 
trusted Welden.Â 

She took a pill on the way to work and immediately began to bleed and suffer from pain.

She lost the baby at the hospital. It was there, that a doctor saw the 
pills Miss Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy -
or abortion.

Federal 
prosecutors said Welden never wanted Miss Lee to have his baby - even 
though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child.

Authorities released a transcript of a conversation Miss Lee had with 
Welden. After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and
agreed have her conversations with Welden recorded.

Welden told Miss Lee that Miss Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious.'

Miss Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara.

'Weapon of choice': This is the bottle of 
abortion pills that Welden gave to Lee after changing the label

'I
woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my 
parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I
wouldn't have bothered you at all.'

'I didn't want to be that guy,' Welden replies.

'So you're going to be the guy that goes and just kills the baby without even letting me know?' Miss Lee says. 'To save your own precious hide? Right?'

Welden responds: 'I guess. If I saved anything, I didn't really save anything.'

Welden also takes time during his conversation with Miss Hill to pity himself.

'My life is over,' he whines. 'I just wanna kill myself.'

After
he admits to giving Miss Lee the abortion drug he says: 'I'm just a 
horrible person, Remee. I'm sorry I ruined everything.'

Welden's father has not been accused of wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime.

Welden was also recorded on jailhouse 
phone calls threatening to smear Miss Lee's reputation and told Miss 
Fillinger that she didn't have to testify in the case, according to 
court documents.
