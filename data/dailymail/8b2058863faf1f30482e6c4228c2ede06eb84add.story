Tottenham are prepared to drop their interest in Ben Davies as they grow increasingly frustrated in their attempts to land the Swansea man.

New Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants the Wales international to be his first choice left back next season.

But the club's failure to strike a deal with Swansea has left Tottenham officials considering alternatives.

All smiles: Swansea left back Ben Davies has had a fine season and attracted interest from Spurs

Spurs and Swansea have been locked in talks over a proposed move for Davies - who is valued at £12million - to White Hart Lane.

Tottenham thought they had made a breakthrough in discussions towards the end of last month, after tabling an offer for the full-back that they believed was enough to snare Davies.

However, Swans chairman Huw Jenkins pulled the plug on the deal at the last minute leaving Tottenham frustrated.

On hold: The 21-year-old left back has been attracting attention after a great season in the Premier League

Tottenham have tried to revive the deal but their attempts have so far proved unsuccessful.

Pochettino remains interested in Davies, but is now assessing alternative options.

Spurs have been linked with a move for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno, but the cost of a deal would prove a stumbling block.
