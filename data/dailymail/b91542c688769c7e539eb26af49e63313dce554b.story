Fraternities are more powerful than the colleges and universities that host them, according to a new expose into their relationships with schools.

The influence on campuses of fraternities is immense, from masses of off-site student housing to donations, fraternities control many aspects of life, according to an article in The Atlantic this month.

The Atlantic also uncovered surprising numbers about crimes committed in fraternity homes – violence is the biggest problem, followed by sexual assaults and intoxication.

‘In many substantive ways, fraternities are mightier than the colleges and universities that host them,’ Caitlin Flanagan wrote after a year looking into the notoriously private organizations referred to as ‘Greeks’ for their use of the Greek alphabet in official names.

Fraternities soldier on through numerous hazing scandals because one out of every eight American college students lives off-campus in a fraternity house.

Off-campus housing relieves schools of costs involved with maintenance and insurance, and allows them to shift resources elsewhere.

‘Getting rid of all that housing would be a huge problem for the colleges,’ Flanagan told CBS News.

The risk, though, of having all those students off-campus is that schools don’t supervise students as they do in dormitories.

No rules: Many fraternities post rules of conduct, but members rarely follow them - excessive drinking and drug use often occurs

This has led to dramatically higher incidents of assault and battery and sexual assault, The Atlantic’s year-long investigation revealed.

‘These kids get liquored up and they get in horrible fights,’ Flanagan continued. ‘There's a kid in a coma in Pennsylvania… Somebody punched him, roundhouse punch. He hit the cement, and he's in a coma.’

That student was pummeled trying to break up a fight.

The second-most committed crime is sexual assault, but Flanagan revealed fraternities are fairly transparent about the number of sexual assaults and more often than not deal with them appropriately.

Hazing is also surprisingly not nearly the problem many perceive it to be.

‘I had assumed before I wrote the piece that hazing was the number one problem… [but] hazing is the least common problem, it's only seven per cent,’ she said.

Not surprisingly though, many of the issues facing fraternities can easily be traced back to binge drinking - even non-violent or hazing-related deaths.

Perception flying in the face of actual reality has forced one fraternity to ban pledging beginning this Sunday, CBS News reported.

The off-campus institutions are able to continue on despite all these issues because colleges don’t want to shoulder the cost of housing the influx of on-campus students that would result from such a move, but also because they are worried about funding.

Fraternity members often give to both their school and their Greek organization.

Removing Greeks from schools would result in alums of both limiting donations.

‘If a college president does something to the fraternity chapter that the fraternity men don't like, they'll cut the money off instantly,’ Flanagan said.

Many successful people, including CEO’s, CFO’s, senators, governors and even a few Presidents pledged fraternities during their college years, the article notes.

‘College presidents aren't as powerful against fraternities as people often think.’

The schools also face the dilemma of not realistically being able to limit students’ off campus behaviors.

‘The university can't come and say, 'You can't belong to a private club that exists on a private land,’ Flanagan explained.

‘It's sort of like saying, 'You can't go to 7-11 off-campus,' she continued. ‘You can go to 7-11, you can go to the Elks Club, you can join the fraternity.’

And students do by the thousands each semester, something that will likely not change any time soon.
