Locked in a tiny cage in a Cypriot dog pound, underfed, his great muscles wasting away, Basil the St Bernard seemed destined for an unhappy ending.

But 3,000 miles away in Grimsby, a barmaid had other ideas.

Natalie Luckhurst, 21, launched a rescue effort befitting Basil’s courageous breed after seeing a photograph of him posted on Facebook by an animal charity.

Tragic: Basil's plight started after he escaped from his home in Cyprus  and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound

Convinced she had to save him but without the money to do so, she raised £1,000 for his medical treatment and flight to the UK, persuaded the animal charity on the island to help her – and eventually succeeded with the help of the local mayor.

Basil, now two, is believed to have been picked up by a dog warden and put in a pound in the Cypriot capital Nicosia after escaping from his home.

Desperate and hungry, Basil was shut up in a 10ft by 3ft cage for eight months after fighting with other dogs. 

The dog weighed just 49kg - when a 
healthy St Bernard should weigh 70kg - and because he wasn’t exercised 
he had severe muscle wastage meaning he couldn’t even sit down.

At first the manager of the pound refused to give Basil up for adoption. But after a long battle, he was released on the mayor’s orders. The charity nursed him back to health, and two weeks ago he arrived at Manchester Airport to be met by his new owner – Miss Luckhurst.

Caged: This was the 3 x 1 metre cage Basil was kept in while at the Nicosia pound in Cyprus. He weighed just 49kg - when a healthy St Bernard should weigh 70kg - and due to severe muscle wastage he couldn't even sit down.

New life: Basil's new life in Grimsby with owner Natalie Luckhurst, 21, is a world apart from his old one where he spent eight months in a cage in Nicosia

She said: 'It cost all that money for flights, food, vet fees and his crate but it was worth every penny.

'It only took just over two months from when I first saw him to organise everything and get him over to the UK.

After a three-month campaign, she 
finally met the dog she had worked so hard to rescue two weeks ago at 
Manchester Airport, and says it’s the best money she’s ever spent.

'As far as I can make out, he escaped from home and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound.'

She said: ‘My mum has St Bernards so I’m used to their size. Basil’s been eating really well and he’s getting to where he should be. I’m just delighted.’

During his early weeks at the pound, 
Basil showed signs of aggression and fought with other dogs - and so was
 moved into a small cage - his home for eight months.

Facebook: Ms Luckhurst found Basil here on the Cyprus Animal Liberation Front (CALF) at which point her campaign to rescue him started

Friends for life: After a three-month campaign to adopt Basil and free him from his life of misery, Ms Luckhurst finally met him at Manchester Airport and he hasn't left her side since

But
 his aggression was only because he was hungry and was trying to get 
food from other dogs. Natalie says the pound kept Basil isolated and 
malnourished, but volunteers tried to give him extra food and monitor 
his welfare.

His chances of
 escape were thwarted because the manager of the pound wanted to keep 
Basil as a guard dog, so all offers to adopt him were rejected.

But
 his plight was noticed by the Cyprus Animal Liberation Front who 
started to lobby for his freedom, which is when Natalie noticed him.

She
 said: “I started my campaign for his freedom in early July submitting 
formal offers of adoption, all of which were ignored. I made contact 
with a woman from a cat and dog sanctuary in Cyprus.

Hand-in-hand: Ms Luckhurst said she was overcome with emotion after seeing Basil in his cramped and cruel conditions in the Cypriot pound and just had to get him to the UK

Home at last: Ms Luckhurst raised over a £1,000  to fly Basil away from his nightmarish ordeal in Cyprus and says it is the best money she has ever spent

He tested positive for Ehrlichia - a 
bacteria transmitted by ticks - and was started on his treatment, before
 being micro-chipped, lead trained and taken out to get used to crowds 
and noises before being flown to the UK.

Natalie said: 'It was so strange when I met him at the airport. I wasn’t sure what his behaviour or temperament would be like.

'But I’m so lucky, because he’s the best dog I’ve ever met. He’s so friendly.

'He loves people, and I was worried he would be afraid of them.

'He’s
 loving and happy, and he just wants to impress people. He can push the 
boundaries a bit but you can tell someone’s hit him before because he 
does cower sometimes.'

Natalie,
 who lives with her boyfriend, 24-year-old steel worker Kyle Suddaby, 
said she was now hoping to build Basil into the big strong dog he should
 be.

Campaign: Ms Luckhurst started her campaign for his freedom in early July submitting formal offers of adoption, all of which were initially ignored

Determined: Ms Luckhurst continued to appeal for Basil's release and adoption, and with the help of the local Nicosian mayor, won the right to have him sent to the UK

A dog's life: 'When I met him at the airport I wasn't sure what his temperament would be like. But I'm so lucky, because he's the best dog I've ever met. He's so friendly', said proud Ms Luckhurst
