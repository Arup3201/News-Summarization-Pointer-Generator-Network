Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list of MPs vulnerable to voters in private rented accommodation

Ed Balls was yesterday named on a hit list of MPs warned they face losing their seats in parliament if they neglect private home renters.

Research suggests the nine million Britons forced to rent because they cannot afford to buy a home will have a crucial sway at next year's general election.

Campaigners have now identified 86 MPs who stand to lose if they alienate 'Generation Rent' and fail to crack down on high rents, poor conditions and abuses by landlords and estate agents.

More than half of the politicians listed are Tories or Lib Dems - suggesting the issue could directly impact the coalition's ability to hold on to power.

The most senior MPs under threat individually, however, are from the Labour Party.

Shadow chancellor Mr Balls is among five shadow cabinet members who feature on the list. Also at risk are Mary Creagh, Chuka Umunna, Sadiq Khan and Gloria de Piero.

The study, produced by ComRes for the campaigning organisation Generation Rent, found 35 per cent of the nine million people in the private rented sector describe themselves as floating voters, who could sway at the next election.

Mr Balls, MP for Morley and Outwood, holds a majority of just 1,101. Some 5,222 voters in his constituency rent their homes privately and the research suggests almost 2,000 of them could switch their vote as the undecided 35 per cent.

Ms De Piero, Labour MP for Ashfield and shadow minister for women and equality, is particularly at risk with a vote margin of just 192 and more than 5,000 private renters in her constituency.

According to the ComRes poll, 46 per cent of those in privately rented homes said they would currently support Labour based on its policies and 23 per cent would vote Conservative. One in ten who voted Tory at the 2010 General Election said they would now vote Labour.

Researchers found 12 per cent would vote Liberal Democrat and 11 per cent would vote for the UK Independence Party.

Alex Hilton, from Generation Rent, said: 'After years of being ignored by Westminster, Britain's private renters will decide whether MPs will keep their jobs.

'The election won't be about Mondeo Man, Worcester Woman or Basildon Man. Anyone who wants to move into Downing Street in 2015 needs to win over Generation Rent.'

Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We are taking action against the small minority of rogue landlords and letting agents, but avoiding excessive red tape, which would force up rents and reduce choice for tenants.'
