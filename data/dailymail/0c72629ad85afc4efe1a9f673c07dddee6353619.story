The taxpayer is being saved millions of pounds by a group of internet geeks in jeans, a long way from the buttoned-up formality of mandarins in Whitehall.

Jordan Hatch is the youngest, having walked away from a degree or even A levels to join the Government’s Digital Service aged just 17.

Tasked with dragging the civil service into the 21st century, he aims to make government relevant to a generation more used to smartphones than form-filling.

Web genius: Jordan Hatch was just 17 when he swapped the classroom for life as a civil servant but he is responsible for some of the most popular features on gov.uk

The team is based in Holborn, halfway between Whitehall and the trendy ‘Silicon Roundabout’ of internet start-ups in East London.

Jordan is the youngest member of a team of 250 which by 2015 is expected to have saved the taxpayer £1.2 billion.

Most of the savings come from mothballing scores of websites for ministries and quangos, to create a single site – www.gov.uk – which becomes a one-stop site for anyone wanting to find out what the government is doing, or access forms, data or advice.

The site has faced criticism for its over-simplified look, but this year beat the Shard and the Olympic cauldron to win Design of the Year.

The chance to work on the mega-site, from its early beta stages, proved too much for Jordan.

His parents bought their first computer when he was only six and at secondary school he designed websites and taught lessons in IT for other students.

He later quit college after completing AS levels in politics, economics and business studies after his freelance computing work took over.

He said: ‘It got to the point where I thought: I've got to make a call.

‘Do I want to focus on my studies or do I want to leave college and do other things?,’ he told The Times.

As a 17-year-old in a government workplace he was too young to officially go to office parties. ‘It was orange Juice and don't tell anybody I'm here,’ he added.

Swapping the classroom for the ultra-informal offices of GDS meant he could quickly put his theory into practice. Now 19, he still lives at home with his parents in North London.

But he is responsible for some of the most popular sections of the site, including an updating calendar on when the next bank holiday is and when the clocks change. He has also designed a tool for paying council tax online.

He could easily get snapped up by internet giants like Apple or Google.

But Jordan insists that part of the appeal is making life easier for the Great British public.

He said: ‘It's very nice to work for your country in a sense. The Civil Service is the ultimate British institution and it's great to be a part of that."

‘Working for the public sector is great. You can actually making user's lives easier. That's what keeps me coming back to work.’

Cabinet office minister Francis Maude has already met Jordan, and believes the use of the internet can transform the way the government works – and spends money.

Launching GDS’s new offices, Mr Maude said: ‘We are determined to offer world class digital products that meet people’s needs and offer better value for taxpayers’ money – and that is why we have set up the Government Digital Service.

‘The GDS will be the centre for digital government in the UK.

‘It will transform the way people access government information by using digital technology to deliver services that put the user first and give them the smartest and most cost-effective service possible.’
