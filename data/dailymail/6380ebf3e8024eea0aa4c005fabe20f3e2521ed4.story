Samuel Eto'o is understood to have refused to take part in an afternoon training session which Sampdoria manager Sinisa Mihajlovic ordered following their 5-1 defeat in Serie A against Torino. 

Mihajlovic scheduled two training sessions on Monday - one in the morning and another in the afternoon - as punishment for his team's performance on Sunday.

But Eto'o, who only joined Sampdoria from Everton less than a week ago, left after the morning session without telling his manager and reportedly did not return.

Mihajlovic, a notoriously tough manager, ordered the double workout after saying he was ashamed of Sampdoria's performance against Torino, where Eto'o came on a second-half substitute.

'There wasn't an argument with Eto'o, for the simple reason that there has to be two people to argue. And instead he did everything by himself,' Mihajlovic said. 

'I didn't see him again after the morning training session nor did I speak to him. 

'I don't know why he left, nor do I know what the club plans to do now. All that is certain is that the player didn't give me any explanation. I consider it a serious lack of respect toward me and the squad.'

However, Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero played down a row. 'It was only a difference of opinions and, truthfully, a small one too,' Ferrero told Italian national news agency ANSA. 'We are calm. Samp is very stable.'

The former Cameroon striker joined just six days ago but there have been reports Sampdoria are prepared to rip up his contract after he allegedly went AWOL.
