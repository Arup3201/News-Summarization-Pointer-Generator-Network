Water drips from the ceiling and splashes on to chairs and the large desk in Barnet manager Martin Allen’s office. It is two hours until their game against bottom-of-the-table Alfreton Town kicks off.

Allen has invited Sportsmail behind the scenes of his Conference table-topping side and there is a small gathering of us. He is behind his desk, partner Lisa is in a chair opposite, on a sofa to the right sit a young couple in their mid-20s, Iain Dalziel and his girlfriend Maddie Bines.

Dalziel is a life-long Barnet fan who never missed a game until they moved to The Hive in 2013. Out of protest he has not been since, but Allen has invited him as a VIP guest to change his mind. Next to them is Tom Clee, the club’s media man.

Sharing a laugh: Allen invited Sportsmail to Barnet to get behind the scenes of the Conference-topping side

Marcus Maddison, Peterborough’s 20-year-old midfielder, scored his second goal in three games since moving from Conference side Gateshead in their 3-1 win over Port Vale. Maddison impressed at the start of the season with four goals in five matches, earning a move to Peterborough. The victory kept them top of League One.

Cheltenham Town have now gone six games unbeaten to move top of League Two. Their goalless draw away to Morecambe, who are now in second place, edged them ahead of Burton to the summit of the table.

Conference side Woking maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 3-1 victory against Lincoln. They sit third in the table behind Barnet and Halifax but are the only side in the league not to lose this season. They have won four — including three in succession — and drawn the other three to stay three points off the top.

There is a stack of white envelopes to Allen’s left on the desk. He picks the top one up — which is soaked in water — curls it into a ball and throws it in the bin.

‘That’s the third one I’ve thrown away since we got here,’ he says. ‘I’ve been told it’s OK by the health and safety man as it’s not near the plug sockets.’ His eyebrows rise slightly in alarm as he nods at the electrical sockets less than a metre away.

Mad Dog Allen points around the room at the orange-and-black paint which covers the grey bricks. ‘When I was out of work I watched a series called Prison Break on Netflix,’ he adds. ‘When I arrived here in March, that’s what this office looked like — a prison cell. So we got it painted in the club’s colours.’

Allen is completely relaxed ahead of kick-off: conversation flows — ranging from his gardening hobby to the 16-year-old striker who is on the bench for the first time. Lisa has to move seats at one point because a drip from the dodgy plumbing has developed over her chair.

There is a knock at the door, swiftly followed by a voice anyone who loves football would recognise. It’s John Motson. Allen gets up to shake his hand, Motson wishes the team luck and the pair walk out of the room.

While they’re gone, Dalziel explains that Motson is a huge Barnet fan, lives locally and is a regular at The Hive when he is not working.

The dream: Allen was completely relaxed before kick off and gave off lively conversation with Sportsmail

The dreaded leak: The room is a constant flow of activity in and out - almost as constant as the drips

Allen returns five minutes later. ‘He just gave the players a team talk,’ he reveals, excitedly. ‘I like to let people into the dressing room for matches. It keeps the players relaxed.

‘For away games we even surprise some fans by picking them up on the team bus near to the stadium.’

The room is a constant flow of activity in and out. Almost as constant as the drips.

Player-coach Jon Nurse steps in to update Allen on the players arriving on time. Allen has barely any staff at his disposal to free up extra money for player wages. Nurse, a forward, and goalkeeper Graham Stack, 32, help out with coaching.

Allen explains that Nurse, 33, brought up his brother when he was 16 after their mother died of breast cancer. ‘I could barely look after myself at the time,’ Nurse adds.

At 2pm, Allen ushers everyone else out of the room and their analyst-cum-scout Omar Yabroudi, 24, enters with the Alfreton team-sheet to go through some final preparations for the game.

‘When Omar arrived he told me he wanted to be a scout,’ Allen says. ‘But he couldn’t drive. The next day, he turns up in the back of a silver Mercedes driven by a bloke wearing a black cap. It turns out his dad is a billionaire from building tower blocks in Dubai. He’s got to be the richest scout in the world.’ Barnet pay him nothing.

Just before the players go out to warm up, Allen’s final team talk is brief, but stern. Arms flail and fingers point at the players whose attention is trained on him.

It is goalless at half-time and Barnet are lucky to still have centre-back David Stephens on the pitch after an altercation with Alfreton striker Massiah McDonald. Referee Paul Rees shows just a yellow card.

Back: Allen is furious with his team’s performance and storms back to the dressing room at half time

Allen is furious with his team’s performance and storms back to the dressing room. Alfreton manager Nicky Law is just as angry.

He follows the referee down the tunnel, where he explains he does not have to speak to him at half time. ‘Hear me out,’ Law says, wide-eyed. ‘He had both hands around his neck.’

Alfreton take a shock lead just after the break — McDonald heading in — but 15 minutes later Barnet are level when John Akinde is fouled for a penalty and Lathaniel Rowe-Turner is sent off. Charlie MacDonald scores the spot-kick.

From the touchline Allen is exerting as much, if not more, energy than his players. It is all worth it when substitute Luisma Villa hits a bullet free kick to win the game in stoppage time.

Rap music pumps from a speaker in the dressing room as the Barnet players celebrate the victory. Allen gives a speech then ends it with: ‘Jack Saville, you showed a lot of courage today so you get the pen.’

He throws a pen to the defender, who strolls up to a white board, as the players cheer in a crescendo, and writes ‘72’ in the corner.

Back in his office, Allen explains: ‘We started the season with 90 in the corner of the board, that’s how many points we need to win the league. After every game, provided we pick up points, I pick a player who deserves to write up how many we have left. We need 72 points to win this league.’

Perhaps if Allen’s team win promotion to the Football League, those leaks in the office will finally be repaired.
