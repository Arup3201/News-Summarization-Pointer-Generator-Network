Horrific: Dr James Bridges and his professor wife Olga were repeatedly stabbed just minutes after arriving at a £1.3million villa in Barbados

A leading British professor has told how he fought to save his wife as she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder at their villa on the Caribbean island of Barbados.

Dr James Bridges, one of the country’s leading experts on toxicology, and his professor wife Olga were repeatedly stabbed just minutes after arriving at a £1.3million villa.

Dr Bridges, 72, of Guildford, Surrey, was stabbed three times while his wife suffered grievous wounds, including a punctured spleen and diaphragm.

The 62-year-old underwent emergency at a hospital in the Barbados capital of Bridgetown, where she is said to be in a stable condition.

Speaking from the hospital Dr Bridges described the ‘sheer terror’ of being attacked soon after they arrived at their luxury beachfront villa.

He said: ‘We had only just let ourselves into the villa. I was downstairs and my wife was upstairs. I heard screaming and rushed upstairs and saw her being stabbed by a masked man with a knife.

‘I tried to pull him off, but he just started stabbing me. It was awful, just terrifying. After he stabbed me he just went back to stabbing my wife who was lying on the floor. It was just sheer terror. I still have a picture in my mind of him standing over here and repeatedly stabbing her.’

Dr Bridges was stabbed three times while his wife suffered a total of seven wounds.

Popular area: The attack on Friday evening took place in the Speightstown Parish on the west coast of the island that is often visited by tourists from Britain. A file photo of a local pub in the area is pictured

‘She was in a much worse way than me,’ he added. ‘Her diaphragm was ruptured and her spleen was also ruptured. She also has a broken rib.

‘She had to undergo emergency surgery, but fortunately she is quite tough and will pull through.’

Dr Bridges, who is chairman of the European Commission’s Committee on Emerging Health Risks, said they had only been in the villa for 40 minutes when the attack took place last Friday evening.

He believes the masked intruder scaled up the back of the beachfront house and entered through the balcony.

The couple had been loaned the villa by a friend and had planned to stay two weeks on the island.

Dr Bridges said the masked intruder stole all their money and credit cards as they lay bleeding on the bedroom floor.

‘The intruder took every penny that I had before getting away,’ he said. ‘To make matters worse I was robbed of the only money I had left when I got to the hospital.’

He added: ‘We are regular visitors to 
Barbados and usually stay in an apartment in Speightstown. On this 
occasion a friend said we could stay in his villa. We were here part on 
business and part holiday.’

The attack on Friday evening took place in the Speightstown Parish on the west coast of the island that is popular with British visitors.

Police said a masked intruder looking for money broke into the property. A neighbour alerted by the couple’s screams called police.

The Bridges were taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the Barbados capital of Bridgetown.

A hospital spokesman said Dr Olga Bridges is in a stable condition. A police spokesman said a local man was being questioned over the attack but declined to give any further details.

Dr Bridges is recognised as one the leading experts on toxicology and environmental health. He has served on many Government committees advising ministers on environmental issues.

He has also written 17 books with his Russian-born wife who is a professor of nutrition. Dr Bridges was for many years head of toxicology and environmental health at the University of Surrey in Guildford.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that a British couple were attacked in Barbados and consular assistance had been offered.

Barbados is one of the most popular Caribbean destinations with British tourists as it is considered one of the safest. It is also a regular haunt of celebrities during the cold British winter months.
