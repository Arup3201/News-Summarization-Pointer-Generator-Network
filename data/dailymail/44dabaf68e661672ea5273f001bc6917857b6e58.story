Sam Vokes has told Sean Dyche he is ready to play a full part in Burnley's fight for Premier League survival as soon as the Clarets boss needs him.

The striker's 20 goals were crucial in Burnley's unexpected promotion from the Championship last season but he missed the final few weeks after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in March.

Vokes finally made his comeback as a late substitute in Burnley's 1-0 loss to Liverpool on Boxing Day, earning a rousing reception both when his name was read out before the game and when he came on.

The 25-year-old has shown in the development games he played in to build up his fitness that he has not lost his eye for goal and, with Burnley having scored only 12 goals in 18 Premier League matches, there is no doubt he has been missed.

Dyche does not feel he is quite ready to start yet and he will almost certainly be among the substitutes again when the Clarets visit Manchester City on Sunday.

Vokes said: 'It was great to be back. It was obviously a tough one to take with the result, going on how we played, but on a personal note it's nice to be back out on the pitch.

'I've been itching to get back. It's been a long-term plan and it's coming together nicely. I got told to aim for the new year so nine months ago I'd probably have taken this.

'I've got three or four 90 minutes under my belt now in the reserves and that's a big thing for me. Whenever the gaffer calls upon me, I'm ready.'

The Wales international accepts, though, that he may have to bide his time even when Dyche does deem him ready.

Ashley Barnes has established himself as Danny Ings' strike partner and scored winning goals against Hull and Southampton while Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Sordell are also on the books.

'There's a lot of competition and that's only good for the club,' said Vokes. 'Barnesy came in and has done fantastically, got a couple of great goals, and match-winning goals as well. It's important we keep that competition and everyone fighting for a place.'

Vokes and Ings were the most effective forward pairing in the Championship last season and Ings has already shown he can be a big danger at Premier League level.

'I'm not surprised at all,' said Vokes. 'We all saw it last year and over the last few years. He's kicked on another level this year. It's good to get back alongside him.'

The Liverpool defeat saw Burnley drop to 19th in the table but there was plenty of room for optimism after a first-half performance Dyche rated as the best of his time at the club.

Ings hit the post and Burnley dominated possession and chances only to be caught out by a Raheem Sterling break in the 62nd minute.

Vokes has seen his team-mates grow into the challenge after a difficult start but knows good performances are not enough.

He said: 'The lads have definitely come on. The first 10 games was obviously getting used to it but we definitely look like we deserve to be here now. We're not getting turned over in games.

'It was always going to be tough but, if we look at performances like (Liverpool), we came up against a strong Liverpool side and held our own for most of the game. It's just important that we come out of games like this with points now.'

The challenges do not get any easier, with second-placed City looking to make it 10 wins in a row on Sunday.

Dyche is hoping Burnley's underdog status can help them, saying: 'You have freedom in those games.

'That doesn't guarantee you a result, they're fantastic. They could change the whole team and still be very powerful at this level.

'But we know the expectation is totally on them, as it was with Liverpool. It means the players can go and play. We believe in what we're doing, that's quite obvious.'
