Agony: Frances Andrade was traumatised by the trial of her former tormentor Michael Brewer and killed herself. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Coopers says she was 'let down' by the criminal justice system

The Home Secretary will look for lessons in the handling of a sexual abuse case after a witness committed suicide but warned police forces must have operational independence.

Theresa May was pressed in the Commons on the case of Frances Andrade, who killed herself after undergoing cross examination on evidence against her former music teacher Michael Brewer.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper urged Mrs May to hold a formal review into the case and said she was 'let down by the criminal justice system whose job it was to help and protect her'.

She compared the approach of Greater Manchester Police in offering counselling and Surrey Police not doing so.

Ms Cooper said: 'The Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner has said in the last couple of days, "it's the responsibility of the police to present evidence to the court with the victim in a way which is untainted".

'That means they will not and should not refer a victim for counselling until after they have given their evidence.

'Do you agree this approach by Surrey Police is completely unacceptable, goes against national guidance, and that victims of sexual abuse should never be denied the support and counselling they need?

'Will you tell all police forces they need to make sure counselling is available?

'And will you ensure a proper review takes place into the handling of this entire case so lessons can be learned from this dreadful tragedy?'

Mrs May replied: 'This was a terrible case when you look at the details of this and we all have sympathy with the family and what they have gone through.

'Obviously this whole question of how the police deal with rape cases is one that is being looked at and we have been trying to improve the police handling of this under both governments, over a number of years.

Guilty: Michael Brewer was found guilty of indecently assaulting Frances after she won a place the music school where he was choirmaster

'We all recognise that one of the issues here is the difficulty victims feel in coming forward and sadly when we see incidents such as has happened in this case, I fear others may be put off from coming forward rather than encouraged from coming forward.

'I think we do need to look very carefully at what has happened at what has happened in this case and very carefully at how we can further improve the system to ensure victims feel they will be believed when they come forward and they can have the confidence of taking their case through the courts.'

Answering a follow up question, Mrs May added: 'We will look to see what lessons should be learnt from this particular case but you will be aware the Home Secretary does not instruct police forces to take particular routes - they do have operational independence and decisions as to how they deal with particular cases.'
