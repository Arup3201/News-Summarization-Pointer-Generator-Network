'Treat patients like people': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will outline plans for just one doctor to take charge of each patient in hospital

NHS patients should be treated as people rather than a collection of body parts, Jeremy Hunt will tell doctors today.

The Health Secretary warns that hospital care has become a series of ‘brief encounters’ with staff and calls for the end of ‘ping pong’ referrals that leaves patients feeling ‘like parcels’.

He will today announce plans for a single doctor to take charge of each patient from the minute they are admitted to the second they are discharged.

Calling for a ‘culture change’ in the NHS, Mr Hunt will say: ‘That means reasserting a simple truth: every patient is a person.

‘A person with a name. A  person with a family. Not just a body harbouring a pathology; not a diagnostic puzzle; not a four-hour target or an 18-week problem; not a cost pressure – and most certainly not a “bed-blocker”.’

Mr Hunt will say he has seen countless examples where care has simply concentrated on ‘a part of the body where things had gone wrong’.

The Mail revealed last month that the NHS will once again write the name of the doctor responsible for each patient above their bed.

Mr Hunt will use a speech at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospital in London today to go further, saying that ‘whole-stay doctors’ should take charge of a patient’s entire period in hospital – rather than pass them from one consultant to another.

The Health Secretary will cite evidence from the US which found that doing so leads to lower rates of readmission and fewer cases of heart failure and pneumonia.

He will also call for doctors to draw up fresh plans to reduce the number of ward transfers. Evidence shows that for elderly patients, every change of ward lengthens the average stay in that ward by more than a day.

'Ping pong' referrals: Mr Hunt wants to end the practice of passing patients from one consultant to another

‘The basic principle should be care being organised around where the patient is, not patients organised around where the care is,’ he will say.

‘I want to see proper, seamless discharge handovers from named consultants to named GPs with direct communication between both parties that ensures care is never interrupted.’

A Royal College of Physicians survey found that nearly a quarter of consultants rated their hospital’s ability to deliver continuity of care as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’.

Mr Hunt will call for hospitals to rethink doctors’ rotas and indicate that the Government will challenge EU working time edicts to improve 24-hour care and weekend cover.

U.S. studies have found that having 'whole-stay doctors' who oversea patients from the moment they are admitted to when they are discharged lowers rates of readmission and heart failure

He will say: ‘One doctor told me that hospital care today has become a series of brief encounters. Another said there has been a loss of long-term relationships because the way rotas worked meant you often never saw the same patient twice. Someone else spoke of a ping pong of referrals.’

The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges has been asked to develop guidance on how to implement the changes by March. Professor Norman Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, welcomed a more ‘streamlined and compassionate’ approach to care.

He added: ‘We have to end the situation where patients are shuttled from one member of staff to another with no one individual taking responsibility for ensuring they receive the right treatment at the right time and in the right place.’
