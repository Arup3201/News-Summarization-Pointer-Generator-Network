Roy Hodgson claims Everton starlet Ross Barkley can have the same impact on the England set up as former midfielder Paul Gascoigne.

England’s head coach recalled Barkley, who has nine caps for his country, to the squad after three months out with a knee injury.

Gascoigne won 57 caps for the country and was the star of Italia 90, but Hodgson believes Barkley can emulate his achievements in the game.

England’s head coach said: ‘He’s got great potential as an impact player, he’s a magnificent runner with the ball, he’s very powerful running with the ball, in terms of being able to run with the ball with pace and power, you could compare him to Paul Gascoigne. 

‘That’s dangerous because now you will make all sorts of comparisons but Paul Gascoigne was a powerful player, powerful runner with the ball, once he set off and went by people they didn’t catch him. Ross Barkley is the same.

‘I think he’s a player with excellent technique, can score goals, interprets the role well, that role, if you like, in behind the front player is a role that Roberto Martinez at Everton believes in strongly, they do a lot of work on it and he interprets the role very well.

‘Obviously we lost him through a long period of time through injury, pleased to have him back, he does give us that enormous possibility if he doesn’t start the game he is a player coming off the bench who can make a difference.
