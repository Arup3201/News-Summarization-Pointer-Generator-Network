This is the touching moment the mother of one of Scotland’s youngest surviving babies got to hold her daughter for the first time.

Claire Cressey said cuddling and kissing baby Emily - born at 24 weeks - was ‘the best moment of my life’.

Ms Cressey, 34, from Coldstream, in the Scottish Borders, enjoyed a precious 20 minutes with her daughter on Mothering Sunday.

Claire Cressey held her baby, Emily, for the first time on Sunday. Emily was born at 24 weeks and weighing just 1lb 3oz. Until now, she had been too vulnerable to be held

Emily was so premature that when she was born it would still have been legal for her to be aborted

Emily, who weighed just 1lb 3oz when she was born on February 27, was so premature she could legally have been aborted.

But after receiving ‘fantastic’ care at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, she is thriving and now weighs just over 1lb 10oz.

The mother-of-four admitted she was physically sick on Sunday morning because she was so worried something might go wrong when Emily was taken out of her incubator.

But the planned 10 minute cuddle was stretched to 20 minutes because Emily responded so well to her mother’s touch, maintaining an even heart rate and temperature throughout.

A delighted Ms Cressey said: ‘I’ve waited for over a month to be able to hold her and it is something I will remember for the rest of my life.

Emily is now a month old and 1lb 10oz. She was briefly able to breathe on her own but now needs ventilation

‘I cried before the nurse even took her out, it was so emotional, I’ve never experienced anything like it before.

‘She snuggled up to my chest and fell asleep, the nurses kept checking her heartbeat and temperature and they were fine so I got longer with her than expected.’

Ms Cressey added: ‘It was very scary. She is so tiny, she can fit in the palm of your hand. I was scared something might go wrong but she coped really well.

‘Actually holding her was quite a shock because it was only then that I realised just how tiny she is.

‘To me she is perfect and I’m very lucky.’

Baby Emily is being carefully watched and kept in a special incubator.

Her father, Alan Coultas, was not able to visit his daughter on Sunday because the couple could not find anyone to look after their other children.

They have to spend more than £110 a week making the 100 mile round trip to the hospital, parking, and paying for childcare.

Kind-hearted members of the public are already donating towards the cost of visiting Emily.

Ms Cressey said: ‘She came so early that any money we had saved has now been spent. At this moment we are having to choose between petrol and food.’

Ms Cressey arrived at the hospital with just minutes to spare before Emily was born after a four hour labour.

After the birth, Emily was rushed straight off to the neonatal unit and placed in an incubator.

At three-days-old, Emily was able to breathe by herself and doctors put her on a lower dependency CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine.

But ten days later, she started to struggle so doctors were forced to ventilate her again, a necessity not uncommon with babies born before 29 weeks.

The couple have been sharing Emily’s journey on a Facebook page, uploading photographs and daily updates on Emily’s condition, receiving messages of support from all over the world.
