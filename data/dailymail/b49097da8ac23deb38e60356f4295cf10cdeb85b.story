The number of patients languishing for hours on trolleys in A&E has doubled in a week.

A total of 16,234 patients waited on trolleys for between four and 12 hours last week, the worst since records began in 2010.

Another 241 were waiting for more than 12 hours, again the highest number ever recorded. These are seriously ill patients whom doctors have decided need to be admitted to a hospital ward.

But a critical shortage of beds means they have to wait hours for one to become available. 

Ambulances queuing up outside Wrexham Maelor Hospital earlier this week as number visiting A&E departments soared  

This week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents due to soaring numbers arriving in A&E. They called in off-duty staff, cancelled non-urgent operations and created makeshift wards.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: ‘These figures show the Tory A&E crisis is intensifying … David Cameron’s failure to produce a plan to deal with this cannot carry on. 

'Their complacency is exposing far too many vulnerable people to too much risk.’ 

The figures for last week also show nearly 11,000 ambulances queued outside A&E for more than half an hour – more than twice as many as this time last year.

The crisis has been blamed on patients being unable to see their GP, particularly out of hours, forcing them to go to casualty instead. 

Cuts to social care also mean hospitals cannot discharge many elderly patients, causing a bed shortage. 

The Government injected £700million into hospitals in the autumn.

Yesterday NHS England, which oversees the health service, gave further details of how the money is being used, such as funding the equivalent of 4,500 full-time nurses and 700 doctors – including locums, staff from overseas and overtime by existing employees – and an extra 5,000 beds.
