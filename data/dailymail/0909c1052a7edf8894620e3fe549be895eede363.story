A teenager accused of planning a pipe bomb attack was allegedly targeting a further education college, police have revealed.

Around 50 homes had to be evacuated in Newcastle after police received reports from concerned neighbours and sent in a bomb disposal squad to Hamilton Place.

Liam Lyburd, of Hamilton Place, has been charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life. 

The teenager has also been charged with five counts of possessing an explosive substance, namely a pipe bomb, with intent to endanger life.

Police claim there was 'intent to cause serious harm' at Newcastle College. 

Officers said they believe their actions prevented an incident taking place.

After they received a report from neighbours at about 11.30am on Monday they searched a property. The neighbour had become concerned after seeing posts of Facebook. 

Police then evacuated the area and people were housed in Westgate Community College overnight. 

Further searches were carried out at the premises overnight and officers found officers found pipe bombs, firearms and three cannisters containing 94 lots of live ammunition as well as a black 'killbag' including black balaclava, knee and elbow pads, nail covered pipe bombs and a lanyard for holding a firearm.

The items are now being forensically examined.

Following completion of the searches, residents returned home on Tuesday morning.

Newcastle College worked  with police throughout their investigation. 

Carole Kitching, principal of the college, said students should attend the college as usual and that officers would be patrolling the campus.

She said: 'I would like to reassure staff, students and their families that their safety has been paramount to us and the college remains a safe place to study.

'Officers will be on patrol around the campus to offer reassurance and anyone who is concerned can speak to an officer or contact the college's welfare team.
