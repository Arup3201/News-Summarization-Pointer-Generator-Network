The Supreme Court handed a victory to religious conservatives this morning, ruling in favor of Christian craft store Hobby Lobby in its lawsuit against the federal government.

In a narrow 5-4 ruling the court said 'closely held' businesses with religious ties like Hobby Lobby are eligible for exemption from a provision in Obamacare that requires private businesses to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception.

A 'closely held' corporation is one in which more than 50 percent of the company's shares is owned by five or fewer people.

At the heart of the case was whether Obamacare's contraception mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which states that the government 'shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion' unless it has a compelling reason to do so.

Hobby Lobby and aligned groups argued that providing some forms of contraception like the morning after pill were tantamount to abortion, which goes against the company's religious beliefs, because life begins at conception.

The court held today that for-profit businesses are afforded the same religious protections as persons under the RFRA.

'Today’s decision is an enormous
victory for personal freedom in America,' said Joshua Hawley, a lawyer at the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, the organization that represented Hobby Lobby.

'This decision confirms that people of
conscience are welcome in business and that all Americans have the right to
follow their moral and social convictions in every walk of life,' he said.

Republican lawmakers and conservative institutions rushed to issue their own statements after the ruling celebrating the court's affirmation of religious liberty and its ruling against the Obama administration and its allies.

'Americans of faith and conscience have been vindicated and this will be a galvanizing moment for the vast majority of citizens who vehemently objected to this mandate and the elected leaders who thrust it upon us,' Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said.

'Today’s Supreme Court decision makes clear that the Obama administration cannot trample on the religious freedoms that Americans hold dear,' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a lawmaker who voted in favor of the RFRA two decades ago and filed a friend-of-the court brief in favor of Hobby Lobby.

McConnell added that, 'Obamacare is the single worst piece of legislation to pass in the last 50 years.'

Senator Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general for Texas who argued in front of the high court multiple times before being elected to federal office, said in a statement, 'This ruling is a repudiation of the Obama Administration’s untenable position that people with sincerely held religious beliefs should be forced to comply with an unconstitutional mandate while a parade of waivers, exemptions, and delays are granted for purely commercial and political interests.'

'The fact that Americans had to bring 
this case in the first place reveals once again just how intrusive 
ObamaCare is. It's a misguided one-size-fits-all policy that not only 
failed to fix our healthcare system but has trampled on our 
Constitutional rights,' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.

The high-profile ruling is a defeat for 
Democrats in Congress and progressive activists who have fought tooth and nail to protect 
provisions of the president's signature law that pertain to women's 
health.

'Make no mistake: Today, once again, the Supreme Court ruled against American women, Planned Parenthood, a pro-choice organization that provides women's health services, defiantly said on Twitter.

'We’re not going to let a handful of extreme bosses & politicians turn back the clock. Forward, not backward,' read another one of the organization's tweets.

'It's unacceptable that in 2014 we are still fighting over women's access to birth control,' said New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of 20 women serving in the upper chamber.

NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading pro-choice organization, criticized the 5-4 ruling as sexist.

'Today's decision from five male justices is a direct attack on women and our fundamental rights. This ruling goes out of its way to declare that discrimination against women isn't discrimination,' the group said in a statement.

The court's three women justices, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagen, made up the majority of the court's dissenting side. All three women were nominated by Democratic presidents.

Pro-choice activists, including the ones pictured here from the progressive group CodePink, were on the scene as well

In addressing the Supreme Court's 
decision today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, 'Today's decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies.'

During his daily briefing Earnest said the president believes in religious liberty and that is why he and his administration have taken steps to provide religiously affiliated non-profits with exemptions from the contraception mandate. However the president does not believe that private businesses ought to be able to 'assert their personal religious views to deny their employees federally mandated benefits,' Earnest said.

It is 'too
 early to say' what kind of steps that the president could take even take if 
he wanted to push back on the high court's decision, Earnest told reporters, but the president has said he will work with Congress to make sure the women affected by today's decision are covered.

Asked if he agreed with Republicans who say the decision was 'a devastating blow' to Obamacare, Earnest said the decision applied to a 'specific' set of businesses and women and the rest of the law remains intact.

What would have been a devastating blow, Earnest said, was if the Supreme Court had ruled two years ago that Obamacare violated the Constitution by requiring Americans to purchase health insurance.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a 
chief proponent of Obamacare, slammed the court's decision as one that 
'jeopardizes women’s access to essential health care' and vowed to 
'continue to fight to preserve women’s access to contraceptive coverage 
and keep bosses out of the examination room.'

'The bottom line is
 that today’s decision is wrong for women. Your boss should never be 
able to make your health care decisions for you,' Reid said.

'A woman's personal health decisions about choosing to use contraception and when to start a family should stay strictly between her and her doctor — not her boss,' Colorado Sen. Chuck Udall, a Democrat facing a stiff reelection battle this fall, said.

'The U.S. Supreme Court's decision unacceptably takes these choices out of doctors' offices and into the workplace,' he continued.

House Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Louise Slaughter of New York and Diana DeGette of Colorado said in a statement blasting the decision that the Supreme Court 'has awarded another one of our precious constitutional rights – the right to free exercise of religion – to for-profit corporations.'

'Despite the Court’s attempt to single out women’s health care in today’s opinion, it leaves the door open to employers being able to deny coverage of other essential health services such as a child’s vaccine or a life-saving blood transfusion based on religious beliefs,' they said.

The women also noted that the ruling would allow businesses to challenge other federal laws on religious grounds.

In the majority opinion the Supreme Court stated that its ruling would not allow businesses to use the religious exemption to discriminate against employees on the basis of race because 'the government has a compelling interest in providing equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.'

It did not specifically address other types of workplace discrimination such as sexual orientation - something liberals are trying to ban via the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

Obama has reportedly said he will issue an Executive Order prohibiting the workplace practice if Congress does not bring the legislation for a vote.
