Mary Johnston, 60, has been voted Glasgow's 87th most popular tourist attraction after being accidentally registered on TripAdvisor

A mother has been voted Glasgow's 87th most popular tourist attraction after being accidentally registered on TripAdvisor.

Mary Johnston, 60, from Bellahouston, in the south side of Glasgow, was given four five star ratings on the popular review website.

A smiling photo of Ms Johnston accompanied her ranking which saw her sandwiched between 88th placed gig venue
 - The Hydro - where Beyonce recently performed - and 86th Ruchill Park, which is said to offer 'the best 
view in Glasgow'.

Trip Advisor’s automatically generated text 
asks users on the website: 'Been to Mary Johnston? Share your experiences!'

Ms Johnston is rated far higher than many of the 
163 attractions listed in the Scottish city.

One TripAdvisor, Perrierdoumbe, wrote
 in his review of Mary: 'This attraction wasn’t in the guidebooks but is
 fun for all the family if you’re a fan of people called Mary or 
rotationally-challenged photos.

'The doorman seemed a bit grumpy though and didn’t seem to want to let us in.'

Jon
 Pavelin wrote: 'I’ve met other Mary Johnstons around the world but 
never a sideways one. Mary, put the kettle on, i’m on my way round after
 work the night. Top banana.'

But when Ms Johnston, who has two grown-up children, found out she was on the website she was horrified and blamed a glitch in the system for her being signed up.

Ms Johnston featured higher than Glasgow's Grosvenor casino, but lower than Ruchill park touted 'as the best view in Glasgow'.

She told the Scotsman: 'I didn’t set it up. It must be a bug in the system or it is malicious.

'I’m already a user and I went on recently to review somewhere in Amsterdam so it may have happened then.

'I’m
 not a huge traveller, but I do like city breaks and have visited places
 such as Prague, Krakow, Lisbon and places like that.

'At least it is a good picture of me.'

Browsers are asked to consider other 
attractions near her including Bellahouston Park and House for an Art 
Lover which are all within 1.1miles of her.

Her profile, which has her photo on sideways, has now been removed.
