The Football Association are confident the FA Cup semi-final between Arsenal and Reading will draw a much larger television audience than Manchester United’ s Premier League trip to Chelsea after revealing the matches will clash.

Just 10 minutes separate the kick-off times of two of the biggest games this season, with the FA Cup encountering an awkward conflict on what is supposed to be a standout weekend for the competition.

Arsenal face Reading at Wembley on Saturday April 18 at 5.20pm for a place in the FA Cup final, with Chelsea hosting United at Stamford Bridge at 5.30pm the same evening in a hugely important Premier League encounter.

Much of the build-up to that slot will focus on Jose Mourinho facing Louis van Gaal, with points on the line for the title race and Champions League qualification. Arsenal’s game against Championship Reading may play second fiddle in the eyes of many neutral football fans.

But FA sources insist viewing figures for their match, broadcast on the BBC, will far outstrip the Premier League contest shown on Sky.

United v Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals managed peak figures of 8.9million people. The terrestrial advantage in this battle is highly significant.

The BBC had first pick of the semi-finals and elected for the time and day that is likely to yield their greatest TV audience. The scheduling of the Premier League match would not feature heavily among considerations.

BT Sport picked up Aston Villa’s semi-final against either Liverpool or Blackburn and that will kick-off at 3pm on Sunday April 19.

It does mean an trickier trip home by train for northern supporters than a Saturday fixture would have represented, but it is understood Metropolitan Police were reluctant to have Liverpool and United fans potentially travelling to and from London Euston at similar times.
