With a wealth of personal connections to the country and a sense of Italian identity ‘rooted' in her psyche, Alex Polizzi's latest series for Channel 5 was always going to be an emotional affair. 

In a touching scene from the first episode of Alex Polizzi’s Secret Italy, the presenter is shown sampling some frittelle - a type of Venetian doughnut, which her late grandmother often used to make. One bite is enough to transport her back to her nonna’s kitchen and tears well up in her eyes.

‘She was an amazing cook and I’m really sad that I didn’t take more advantage at the time. Coming back here has reminded me just how much this city means to me’, she says.

All four of Polizzi’s grandparents were Italian and she considers the show to be a homage to her family and the regions they came from. It’s a heartfelt love letter to the country - one that is littered with superlatives and will have viewers researching their next trip as soon as the credits roll.

Polizzi, who is best known to viewers as The Hotel Inspector, admits that Italy is a ‘well-trodden path’ but most of the locations that feature in the programme have some sort of personal significance, including the hillside village of Monforte, which was her late grandfather’s home, and the Amalfi coast, which she visited on her honeymoon.

By ‘secret’ she means the side of the country that tourists usually don’t get to see, including lace-making on the island of Burano, a family cheese-making business in Bagolino and a women’s prison that makes toiletries for luxury hotels.

Going back to her roots: The presenter has a strong connection with Venice and has visited more than 40 times

Her grand tour starts on Friday with a visit to Venice, which is ‘achingly, achingly beautiful’ and gives her ‘shivers to be back’.

The city, she asserts, is one of the wonders of the world and stirs up further emotion: ‘I feel tearful of the beauty of it, it takes my breath away. It’s places like Venice that marks us out as a civilised world and it makes me sad because I don’t think we’re creating anything these days that is as impressive.’

It’s a city that Polizzi knows well: her grandmother, who died five years ago, was Venetian and her mother’s best friend still lives there. She has visited at least 40 times but admits that, while there’s much to love, there is one thing that detracts: the crowds of tourists.

‘Venice has become so touristy and it is so crowded, it can be really off-putting’, she says. ‘ Lots of people go to Venice with a kind of ‘tick box’ mentality, you know, ‘must see the Guggenheim, must go over Accademia bridge, must, must’. And actually, they are so busy doing that that they don’t really take time to look around.’

Like many people, Polizzi is not a fan of the big cruise ships that sail into Saint Mark's Basin, which she says dwarf Venice and don’t add enough to the local economy: ‘People come off with a packed lunch and a bottle of water. They might buy a coffee but that’s all they buy and then they throng the streets like some mad, baying pack all with the same list of things to see. 

'It makes it a pretty miserable experience really. I would say that between the hours of 10am and 6pm central Venice is pretty impassable.’

But, Polizzi claims, escaping the tourist hordes isn’t all that difficult: one way is to get up very early in the morning or go out late at night. In the show, she heads to Piazza San Marco in the heart of the city at day break and has only early morning joggers and sweet sweepers for company: ‘It feels as if it is a stage set, it is so beautiful.’

At a deserted Bridge of Sighs she realises it’s the first time in years that she hasn't had to fight her way through ‘six layers of tourists with cameras’.

Another of Polizzi’s tips is to get the number one water bus - or vaporetto - which takes you all the way up the Grand Canal: ‘Instead of spending €80 for 40 minutes in a gondola you get to actually travel in comfort and see these amazing palazzi. It’s really exciting how beautiful everything is.’

Another drawback to the city is just how expensive it is. Polizzi takes the cameras into the Bauer Hotel’s opulent Royal Suite, which once hosted Charles and Camilla and costs a regal €15,000 a night. And the world got a glimpse of how extravagant life in the city could be when George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin at the seven-star Aman Canal Grande Hotel last month.

‘I know the Aman and it is unbelievably beautiful, it really is’, Polizzi says. ‘But I think what’s sad in Venice, even to stay somewhere really pretty nasty costs €250 to €300 a night. There’s not much option. You either stay on the mainland and come in very early in the morning or you come on a cruise ship. Otherwise, most people just can’t afford it.

‘Every time we go I’m just astonished at how expensive it is. It’s the only place in the world that my husband has ever refused to let me touch the mini bar. It’s €10 for 30ml of coke, it’s really ridiculous.’

Another highlight of the series for Alex was returning to Rome, where she lived for three years in her twenties. Her father, Count Alessandro Polizzi (he was killed in a car accident when Alex was nine), was Roman and his family still live there.

Polizzi lived with her boyfriend in the city’s Jewish Quarter which she says felt like a little village and boasts the best ice cream in Rome. The quarter also has one of the city’s oldest bakeries, which is known for its excellent kosher cakes and infamous customer service.

Pasticceria Boccione is run by three formidable sisters and is so famous it doesn’t need a name above the door. But service comes without a smile: ‘When I lived there I visited this shop almost every day and every time it was like the first time they had ever seen me’, laughs Alex. Even in front of the camera, the ladies remain poker-faced. Her guide, Micaela Pavoncello explains: ‘They pretend they are annoyed but inside they love it.’

Alex cut her teeth as a restaurant manager working for her uncle at the city’s Hotel de Russie, which is owned by Rocco Forte Hotels (Alex’s grandfather was Lord Forte who founded the Forte Group). The hotel boasts a spectacular garden, which Polizzi describes as a ‘secret oasis of calm’ and which the artist Pablo Picasso at one time treated like his ‘own Roman living room’.

‘It’s very special. As far as I know it’s the only garden in a hotel in the whole of Rome. Anyone who is in Rome should go there for a drink just for a break from the frenetic pace of life’, Polizzi says.

But her three yearsin Rome weren't a bed of roses and Polizzi describes the period as a ‘very bittersweet time’.

‘When I was growing up, I always felt very Italian when I was in England and very English when I was in Italy. I thought I was going to put that to bed when I fell madly in love and moved to Italy full time’, she explains. 

‘And I realised when I was in Italy that England is an amazing place to live in just because it has order, there are rules. I found the kind of chaos of the Italian systems completely overwhelming. I was happy to move back actually.’

Polizzi may not want to live in Italy but she returns to the country several times a year and is keen to introduce her two small children to their heritage. The show allowed her to spend more time in Naples, which she says people avoid because it is big, chaotic and associated with the mafia, but which she found to be fascinating. She also advises sunseekers to head to Sardinia if they want beautiful coastline: ‘The Amalfi coast is very scenic but it’s not the most beautiful sea in Italy by any means.’

But The Hotel Inspector reveals that even she made some bad choices when it came to accommodation: ‘I'm just like everyone else, when I was planning this trip I had to stick a pin in lots of hotels. I actually walked out of one hotel. They knew I had a one-and-a-half year old child and it had an unenclosed staircase in it. I could just see him falling to his death immediately!’
