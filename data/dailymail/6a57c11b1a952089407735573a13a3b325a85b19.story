One of Britain's leading family judges said the greatest pain of family breakdown is inflicted on children. File picture

The impact of divorce should be counted not in money but in sheer pain and human suffering, a High Court judge has said.

Sir Paul Coleridge said the real cost of family breakdown comes in the pain of parents who part and the children who are affected by it deep into their adult lives.

He called for parents to learn  ‘personal restraint and self-imposed boundaries’ to replace the taboos against divorce and single parenthood that have faded from life in Britain over the past five decades.

Sir Paul, who sits in the family court as Mr Justice Coleridge, said in a speech published on the eve of a conference of his think tank, the Marriage Foundation, that the greatest pain of family breakdown was inflicted on children.

‘That is where I encounter it, day in day out, in the arena of the family courts,’ Sir Paul said.

‘Let it not be forgotten that 50  per cent of all children are not living with both parents by the time they are 15.

‘There are millions of them and it is they who are the real victims and casualties.

‘Their parents are too, of course, but the children are given no choice, are never consulted and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives, slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives.’

Sir Paul said: ‘Let us never forget, when we are debating in a theoretical way, the pros and cons and ramifications of this subject, what the real cost of family breakdown is and what it looks like.

Sir Paul Coleridge, said: 'Children are given no choice, are never consulted and only rarely considered'

‘It is not measured primarily in money but in sheer pain and human suffering for all the adults and  children involved. And in lives permanently affected to a greater or lesser extent.’

Sir Paul said families were no longer held together by unwritten rules which forbade husbands and wives to split, or unmarried women to  have children.

‘In the old days society was held together by rigid taboos and stigmas which prevented parties from divorcing and stigmatised illegitimate children,’ he said.

‘These taboos were indiscriminate in their application and led to much inhuman behaviour and unhappiness. I am genuinely thankful they have evaporated and been consigned to the scrap heap of history in favour of individual choice.

‘However, if we are to enjoy freedom to choose we must be helped to understand and make the right choices for ourselves and our children.

‘A society without boundaries is not the only alternative to nasty taboos.

‘If we are not to have restraint by taboo, we must have personal restraint and self-imposed boundaries born of a sophisticated understanding of what makes us all, as individuals and as a society, happy and fulfilled.’
