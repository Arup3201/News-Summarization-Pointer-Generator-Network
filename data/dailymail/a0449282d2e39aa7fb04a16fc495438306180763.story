Arch-Blairite: Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke has revealed that he is 'pessimistic' about the Labour party¿s chances at the next General Election

Fears that Ed Miliband could be leading Labour to defeat against David Cameron were last night raised by one of the party’s most influential figures.

Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke revealed that he was ‘pessimistic’ about the party’s chances at the next General Election.

In an interview with Catholic newspaper The Tablet, Mr Clarke warned: ‘I don’t think the Opposition is doing very well at the moment.’

The blunt warning will chime with  the private fears of many Labour MPs who feel their party should be much further ahead of the Tories in the polls.

Without mentioning the Labour leader by name, Mr Clarke – who backed Mr Miliband’s brother David in his leadership bid – laid bare his concerns Mr Cameron could cling on in No10.

The former Norwich South MP said he did not think Labour was in a ‘very good state of affairs’ and hinted many colleagues were too optimistic about the outcome of the next Election.

Mr Clarke said: ‘I’m pessimistic from a Labour point of view, more pessimistic than I think many in Labour are.’

Warning his party had to do more  to ‘earn respect’, the former Blairite heavyweight insisted the economy would determine the outcome of the 2015 contest. But he suggested the Coalition had wrongly succeeded in blaming the economic downturn entirely on Labour.

He said: ‘I think the Government has succeeded with the – in my view, completely false – assertion that [the downturn] was all the fault of Labour. But I don’t think we contested it in the first few months, and I’m not even sure we’re really contesting it effectively now.

'Therefore the [Conservative] argument that says: “We’ve inherited this mess, we are certainly making progress .  .  . do you really want Labour to come back in?” – is going to be a very powerful argument.’

The remarks come two years after he raised doubts about the ‘coherence’ of Mr Miliband’s message to Labour’s 2011 party conference and warned Mr Miliband had a ‘long way to go’.

He said then: ‘I didn’t think there was coherence, let’s put it politely, in what Ed Miliband was saying and the main job for the new team is to get a coherent set of policy propositions.’

Two Eds: Mr Clarke's comments follow polls 
showing the public has more trust in David Cameron and George 
Osborne to steer the country back to health than they do in the Labour 
counterparts Ed Miliband and Ed Balls

Mr Clarke’s intervention comes amid mounting doubts among Labour MPs that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is the man to persuade voters to let Labour get their hands on the economy again.

It also follows polling evidence the public has more trust in Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne to steer the country back to health than they do in Mr Miliband and Mr Balls.

One Labour MP said: ‘Two years ago, Charles Clarke wasn’t convinced that Ed Miliband was the man to take us back into power. It looks as though he hasn’t really changed his mind.’
