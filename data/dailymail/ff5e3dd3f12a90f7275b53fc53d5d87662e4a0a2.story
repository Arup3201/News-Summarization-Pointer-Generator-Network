You might think of cats and dogs as merely faithful companions.

But a new book says we are starting to treat them more and more like humans.

And it may affect our laws, not only legally but socially as well, in ways we hadn’t imagined.

Mugshot: A new book claims that cats and dogs are being treated more and more like humans

In the US, 90% of pet-owners regard their animals as part of the family.

And $60 billion (£35 billion) was spent on companion animals in the US alone in 2013.

The implications of this are that owners are treating their pets just like they would another human.

‘People are shelling out money and risking their lives to save their pet,’ David Grimm, author of Citizen Canine: Our Evolving Relationship With Cats and Dogs tells MailOnline.

‘You wouldn’t do that for a bird or a toaster. Cats and dogs are getting this rarefied status in the home.'

Grimm, who also teaches science journalism at John Hopkins University, Maryland, says that cats and dogs have achieved a status in Western cultures that is unheard of for any other animal.

They are being treated more like people in society and law, blurring the lines between animals and person.

Research has found dogs are the most popular pets for animals lovers.

Married men living in the countryside are most likely to own a dog.

While single women in their twenties are most likely to own a cat.

More than half of dog owners describe themselves as hardworking.

Whereas the majority of cat owners claim to be introverted and messy.

‘In some legal cases the best interests of the cat and dog are considered,’ Grimm continues.

‘And judges are awarding more emotional distress damages from killing cats and dogs.

‘In the past it used to be $50 (£30), now it’s in the tens of thousands of dollars.

‘And during Hurricane Katrina, rescuers were saving pets as well as people.

‘It’s a revolution not only in our homes, but in society and law.’

While the change in status of the animals may give rise to complications, it also has some benefits.

Not least, the animals now have greater protection than ever before.

But this could have some far-reaching connotations.

For example, Grimm envisages a future where if a pet owner didn’t walk their dog enough, or it wasn’t given proper medical treatment, an organisation could turn up and take it away like a child.

‘There are a lot of bizarre consequences, and perhaps if pets were regarded as people they couldn’t be neutered.

‘So there’s a really interesting precipice for where we decide to go next.’

Doctor, doctor: Treating pets more like people could make trips to the vet more complicated

In ancient Egypt cats were worshipped as gods and given ethereal status, but this is one of the first times in history that they have been given almost an equal footing to humans.

According to Grimm, some people are fighting for cats and dogs to be considered more like children.

They could one day be allowed into restaurants, and apartments would not be allowed to have ‘no pet’ policies.

But from the perspective of the cats and dogs themselves, we’re not quite sure if they are starting to think like us yet.

‘From more than a dozen labs around the world studying dogs, we know they have a sense of morality, justice and jealously,’ says Grimm.

‘We are discovering more going forwards.’

‘Cats are harder to study, there hasn’t been a lot of research into the feline mind.’

‘But as a cat owner myself, I hope we’ll discover they’re just as capable as dogs are.’
