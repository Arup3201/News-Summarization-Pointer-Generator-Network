Bare facts: Naked rambler Stephen Gough has lost his appeal at the European Court of Human Rights

At last, the Naked Rambler has reached the end of the road.

After almost a decade in and out of prison, Britain’s most surprising inmate — real name Stephen Gough — has lost his chance of freedom at the European Court Of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

He must now keep serving his two-and-a-half-year sentence in Winchester Prison for breaching an indefinite Asbo against being naked in public.

The former Royal Marine from Eastleigh, Hampshire, had claimed the right to remain naked under Articles Eight and Ten of the European Convention On Human Rights: the right to freedom of expression and the right to a private life.

The Court — normally so indulgent of all sorts of crackpot human rights dreamt up by greedy lawyers — accepted that the 54-year-old had a right to freedom of expression; and that the ‘acceptance of public nudity in a modern society is a matter of public interest’.

The judges did not accept that this gave him the right to strip off in public. Nor did they agree his cycle of imprisonment, freedom and imprisonment violated his rights.

Is he cowed? Not a bit of it. When Gough next steps outside Winchester Prison, you can bet he’ll still be in his birthday suit.

He even insists on going naked in jail, which is why he has spent much of his prison time in solitary confinement.

‘I expected them to take the wider view,’ he said on hearing the verdict. ‘They have not. Then again, what great endeavour ever succeeded without having to surmount many obstacles that stood in its way? Why should it be any different for me? I have no choice but to continue.’

Gough, the son of a carpenter, left the Marines at 21 to explore Thailand and take up Buddhism, and then join the Moonies. ‘I was looking for the answer,’ he said — but eventually came back to live in Hampshire, working as a lorry driver.

Now, his life is dedicated to the open road — with no clothes on.

He first started walking naked in Canada, where he’d moved for a spell with his partner and two children.

As he has put it, one day he had an ‘epiphany’: that he was ‘good’ on a fundamental level — as was his naked body, too.

He embarked on his public naked campaign in Britain in 2003, on a nude walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats during which he was arrested 15 times and imprisoned for 140 nights.

That didn’t stop him doing the same walk — and being arrested and imprisoned all over again — in 2005.

On the most recent occasion he was released, in April this year, he strolled out of Winchester Prison wearing only his shoes and was promptly rearrested for breaching a pre-existing Asbo, which had been imposed in 2013.

He was convicted over that matter last month, leading to his current two-and-a-half- year sentence.

Mr Gough is pretty hardline about nudism. He feels it’s something of a mission — and certainly not an activity to be confined behind closed doors.

‘I stand for freedom,’ he has claimed. ‘Some people heat up their house especially so they can go naked and I think that’s nuts.’

Others fear that description might better apply to him. Even his own mother, Nora, has never understood his motivation. ‘I know it’s something to do with freedom but he’s not free, is he? Stuck in jail,’ she commented earlier this year.

Certainly, Gough has forfeited a normal life: wife, family, career. Before prison, he had no obvious source of income, describing his naked antics as his version of ‘getting a proper job’, and reportedly sleeping rough on his rambles. His two children are teenagers, and he is no longer with their mother.

During a 2012 court appearance he broke down in tears, saying: ‘There’s nothing about me as a human being that is indecent or alarming or offensive. That’s where I’m coming from, which is deep inside.’

It takes around £65,000 to imprison a person in Britain, after police and court costs are taken into account; the actual prison term then costs around £40,000 a year. Over the past 11 years, Gough has been arrested more than 50 times.

Practically every time he walks out of prison, he is arrested again for being naked. And whenever he appears in court, it is normally an extended hearing because of his refusal to wear clothes — which can lead to extra contempt of court charges.

At a conservative estimate, more than half a million pounds has been spent on convicting and jailing him.

The waste of police and court time has been immense, too, at a time when the judicial, policing and prison system is severely overstretched. He is currently among 85,720 people behind bars in Britain. Meanwhile, his lawyers say there’s been ‘no discussion, certainly no ruling, on Stephen’s mental health’.

In Britain, there is no single, simple law against public nudity. That means you’re not immediately breaking the law if you go skinny-dipping on your summer holidays. Naturism, too, is allowed by the law, which exempts those ‘whose intention is limited to going about his or her lawful business naked’ from prosecution under the 2003 Sexual Offences Act.

That Act rightly outlaws flashing — the exposure of your genitals with the intention of causing harm or distress.

Naturists are also exempted from the laws on outraging public decency, under which you can be prosecuted for public acts of a lewd, obscene or disgusting nature. But Gough doesn’t think of himself as a naturist, nor do naturists think he is one of them.

Where Gough runs into trouble is under the Public Order Act 1986, which criminalises ‘disorderly behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress’.

With this Act, Gough’s own intentions are neither here nor there. What matters is the effect on other people’s minds.

Understandably, parents of small children are particularly alarmed when Gough comes striding along, naked except for his boots, socks and, on sunny days, a hat.

On these occasions, he is often his own worst enemy. ‘How can nature expressed in human form be indecent?’ he said on hearing that his appeal had failed in Europe.

‘Yet it is these absurd beliefs that form the underlying assumptions of the countless criminal charges and convictions against me, resulting in over nine years in solitary confinement in British prisons.’

The European Court case goes back to an incident in 2011, when he was asked by two policemen in Perth to put his clothes on. He had just walked out of HM Prison Perth — naked, of course.

When the case got to court, he again appeared naked and refused to heed the sheriff’s warnings that he would be held in contempt if he didn’t get dressed.

The sheriff duly sentenced him to 330 days for breach of the peace and 90 days for the contempt charge, along with 237 days unspent from a previous sentence — a total of one year, nine months and 18 days.

And, as the law stands, complicated as it is, the conclusion is clear — Gough will go on being arrested until he puts his pants back on.

Gough’s lawyer, Mike Schwarz of firm Bindmans, acknowledges this is the case.

‘As the law stands, even if there’s no one around to be offended, he could go to prison for several years. In our view, that’s disproportionate.’

His client, he expects, will probably be released from his current sentence in a year and a half — and is ‘pretty set’ on continuing his campaign.

Indeed, Gough’s lawyers are now launching an appeal against his conviction for breaching his ASBO, on the basis that he was not allowed to appear naked in court to defend himself.

Perhaps Gough’s mad, inconvenient but single-minded crusade will eventually force the police and courts to reconsider those endless prosecutions.

After all, who breaks a naked butterfly on a wheel?
