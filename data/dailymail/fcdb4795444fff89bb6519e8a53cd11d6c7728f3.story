Jonas Gutierrez could yet be afforded an emotional farewell appearance for Newcastle United after his proposed move to Velez Sarsfield broke down.

The 31-year-old – who has twice beaten testicular cancer – returned to Argentina last week for talks with the club where he made his professional debut.

But Gutierrez was back on Tyneside on Monday morning after a deal to satisfy all parties failed to materialise.

Gutierrez was thought to be on his way out of the club, but now could be set for an emotional farewell

With his contract set to expire in the summer, the former Real Mallorca winger has spoken of his desire to appear one more time for the Magpies.

That dream appeared to have gone when he opened talks with Velez, with whom he had trained following his all-clear from cancer in November.

But Gutierrez will now resume training with the Magpies and his next outing is likely to be for their Under-21 side.

Supporters, however, will be hoping to see him in the first-team before his exit in the summer after seven years at St James’ Park.
