Ronaldo used to be one of the most feared goalscorers in world football.

But  his weight has fluctuated in the later years of his career and into his retirement, and now the World Cup winner has shown he wants to rediscover his athletic touch.

In a series of posts uploaded via Instagram, the former Brazil marksman has been hitting the gym and demonstrated he is trying to regain the agility he would once use to escape the attention of defenders during his career.

But in later years, striker Ronaldo struggled to stay in shape and had problems with his weight

And he showed he can jump an incredible 113 centimetres, so could be giving basketball star Kobe Bryant a run for his money soon.

During his playing career, Ronaldo spearheaded the Brazil attack in the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, scoring both goals in the final as his side beat Germany.

He also enjoyed spells across Europe at Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven at club level.
