A firefighter who was left paralysed for life by a motorbike crash battled 16 years of pain but ended up committing suicide after doctors told him there was ‘nothing wrong with him’.

Derek Tonks, 43, was left with only the use of his right arm after he suffered a major spinal injury when he was crushed under a car in June 1998.

He had been travelling to his second ever shift after spending 10 years trying to join West Midlands Fire Service when he was struck by a car in Willenhall, West Midlands.

Accident: Derek Tonks, 43, was left with only the use of his right arm after he suffered a major spinal injury in a motorbike crash in June 1998 and lived with 16 years of pain

An inquest heard how, following the accident, Mr Tonks bravely battled his disability to live as independently as possible.

He taught himself to drive again, went on holidays, enjoyed diving and lived on his own in a specially adapted flat.

But the hearing was told Mr Tonks killed himself at his home on February 4 after ‘going downhill’ following a confrontation with doctors earlier this year.

The inquest heard how he had gone to The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, in Oswestry, Shropshire, because he was having trouble swallowing.

Mr Tonks told doctors he felt full after only a small amount of food and thought his spleen, which had been ruptured in the accident, had swollen to block his digestive system.

Giving evidence his mother Patricia Tonks, who went to the hospital with her son, said: ‘He was told there was nothing wrong and was shouted at by a doctor.

‘After that his mood changed from trying to fight to get better to giving up.

‘It was downhill from there.’

She also said he felt uncomfortable and could not sleep at night, feeling his body to be twisted and deformed, but doctors said this was not supported by X-rays.

She told the inquest at Walsall Manor Hospital how she begged her son not to give up and even offered to accompany him to the Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland, for assisted suicide.

Mr Tonks, who was known as Andy, left notes for his parents, sister and a former girlfriend before taking a fatal dose of prescribed antidepressants.

On Friday, the inquest heard he had told a friend he intended to commit suicide and coroner Robin Balmain concluded that he killed himself from an overdose.

He said: ‘This was a young man who’d got lots going for him, who was clearly a very determined character.

‘This is in every way a tragedy.’

Mrs Tonks said her son had always refused to give up over the years, despite everything life threw at him.

He spent weeks in intensive care after his spine was crushed as he rode to work at Handsworth Fire Station, in Birmingham, on June 5, 1998.

It was his dream to follow in the footsteps of his father, also called Derek, who was a firefighter in nearby Dudley.

Mrs Tonks said: ‘He got on a course in January 1998 and then in May 1998 the course ended.

‘He started work, did one shift and then, on the way to his next one, he had his accident.

‘All his dreams ended. Even after that he didn’t give up.

‘The last few years wore him down and it was so out of character. But he was such a strong, amazing person.

‘He was such a nice person. Everyone liked him. Now he’s gone, I just hope to God he’s happy.

‘We loved him. He was an amazing young man. As much as I miss him, I’m happy he is at peace.’
