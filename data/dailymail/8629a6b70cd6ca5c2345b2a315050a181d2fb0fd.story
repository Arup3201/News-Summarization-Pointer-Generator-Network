Cricket commentary box legend Richie Benaud has revealed he is receiving radiation treatment for skin cancer.

The development comes a little more than a year after Benaud, 84, suffered serious injuries in a car crash while returning from a game of golf. 

His iconic voice has been missing from the Nine Network's commentary since the accident thirteen months ago.

Doctors are pleased with Benaud's progress, who told reporters he was 'coping with it very well'. 

The cricket legend said he believed the cancers, on his forehead and the top of his head, were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen.

'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the Nine Network. 

'I wish I had. You live and learn as you go along.'

The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun.

'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said. 

'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' 

He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae.

However, he confirmed he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in his home town.

'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking.

'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.'

Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great allrounder Keith Miller.

'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said.

'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat.

'We follow various people and 'Nugget' Miller never wore anything on his head, so I didn't.

'I wish I had.'
