The 23-year-old Maryland man who climbed over the White House fence Wednesday night has been charged with felonies for assaulting two police dogs and making threats, the Secret Service said Thursday.

Dominic Adesanya of Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for previous outstanding warrants, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. Adesanya has also been charged with four misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest and unlawful entry.  

The Los Angeles Times reports that Adesanya had tried to access the White House before when he jumped a security barrier on July 27.

The 23-year-old has since been charged with assault, resisting arrest, and unlawful entry 

An agent said Adesanya told him it 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.' 

He was released two days later after a mental evaluation found him 'incompetent' to stand for trial, but the next day, he was again taken into custody as he tried to enter the Treasury Department.

He got into a scuffle with three police officers before being detained. He was released, but missed a trial scheduled for September 9, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

On Wednesday, video showed the moment Adesanya jumped the White House fence just after 7:15pm and stood on the North Lawn, gesturing and lifting his shirt, until he was taken down by K-9 units and the Secret Service.

On the lawn, Adesanya kicked a Secret Service K-9 unit that ran at him before another dog wrestled him to the ground and he was taken into custody.

Agent John Grimsley, in an affidavit filed Thursday, said that Adesanya told him he 'was going to keep coming back until he saw President Obama.' 

'Dogs got him,' a spokesperson for the Secret Service told Reuters after the incident. The White House was put on lockdown for a little over an hour but was not evacuated. 

The Secret Services dogs, named Hurricane and Jordan, were taken to a veterinarian after the incident to be treated for minor bruising. Both have since been cleared to return to work.  

Adesanya's last post to Instagram on Tuesday showed an I Voted sticker captioned 'Voted for this B #ImpeachObama.'

Other photos show him in action for Stevenson University in track and field, or showing off his physique in shirtless selfies. 

Speaking with ABC 2, Adesanya's father said his son had been arrested at the White House before and that he wanted to speak to the president about how people were out to get him.

He also seemed to have an obsession with the Rothschild family, in particular Nathaniel Philip Rothschild, the British-born Swiss financier. 

On a LinkedIn page with zero connections, in place of a job title, he describes himself as an 'American Slave' and rants about the Rothschild banking family.

Lockdown: The grounds of the White House were placed on lockdown after the jumper scaled the fence and ran onto the lawn

'Still waiting for Nathaniel Philip Rothschild and his father; Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild-4th Baron Rothschild to let me go,' his profile states. 

After his previous arrest, Adesanya claimed the banking family that he said 'owned the Federal Reserve Bank' was targeting him, and he said he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed, according to a court document. At the time, he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening and return to court September 9.

Adesanya was reported to be unarmed at the time of his arrest and was taken to the hospital.

The incident comes a time when tensions and security concerns are high. 

Earlier Wednesday, a Canadian soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa before gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeauinto was shot and killed by the sergeant at arms.

Subdued: The man punched a USSS K-9 unit as it tried to knock him to the ground and was transported to the hospital, though it was not clear what the injuries were (brightened to show detail)

Adesanya is the seventh person who has made it over the fence this year.

The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper carrying a knife sprinted across the same lawn, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before he was felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody.

That embarrassing September 19 incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job.

After Pierson resigned, an agent who once led Obama's protective detail came out of retirement to lead the Secret Service until Obama names a new director, pending the completion of internal and independent reviews of agency practices.

This week, a federal judge delayed the arraignment of Omar Gonzalez, the man charged in September's fence-jumping incident, because of questions about his mental fitness to stand trial.

Gonzalez has been indicted on several charges, including carrying a knife into the White House and assaulting two Secret Service officers.
