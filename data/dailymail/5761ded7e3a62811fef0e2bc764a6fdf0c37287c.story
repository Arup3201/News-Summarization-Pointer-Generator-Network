A U-2 spy plane is being blamed for a software glitch at a Californian air traffic control center which led to delays earlier this week.

Hundreds of flights were either cancelled or delayed on Wednesday afternoon and it was a relic from the Cold War that appears to be to blame.

According to NBC News, the U-2 was flying at 60,000 feet, but air traffic control computers were attempting to keep it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it.

Hidden disruption: A Cold War-era U.S. Air Force U-2 spy plane forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at and around LAX on Wednesday afternoon

The computers at the L.A. Center are programmed to keep commercial airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other.

The spy plane’s altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called ERAM, which generates display data for air-traffic controllers. Back-up computer systems also failed.

The U-2 spy plane is the same type of aircraft that flew high-altitude spy missions over Russia 50 years ago and more recently Afghanistan.

The aircraft passed through the airspace monitored by the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, California.

On Wednesday, Government officials were not immediately sure why the system had failed.

Areas affected by the shutdown included Southern California, western Arizona, southern Nevada and part of Utah.

Going nowhere: Hundreds of flights were either cancelled or diverted from Los Angeles Airport, one of the countries biggest airports. The FAA announced on Monday that it was the high-flying plane's complex flight plan that overloaded flight tracking systems, not 'spy signals'

The center handles landings and departures at the region’s major airports, including Los Angeles International (LAX), San Diego and Las Vegas.

At LAX there were 27 cancellations of arriving flights, as well as 212 delays.

The FAA said that it was 'investigating a flight-plan processing issue' at the L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center.

It has not confirmed that the glitch was related to the presence of the spy planes operation.

'FAA technical specialists resolved the specific issue that triggered the problem on Wednesday, and the FAA has put in place mitigation measures as engineers complete development of software changes,' said the agency in a statement.

The computer that failed is part of the En Route Automation Modernization system, known as ERAM. The F.A.A. has been rolling it out since 2008 in an effort to integrate data from more sources, increasing the number of planes that can be tracked and allowing more direct routing, among other improvements.

'The FAA will fully analyze the event to resolve any underlying issues that contributed to the incident and prevent a re-occurrence.'

NASA uses the planes to conduct scientific research. The U.S. Air Force is still flying U-2s, but plans to retire them within the next few years.

The U-2 planes which were created in the 1950s to monitor Soviet nuclear sites. More recently they listened to Taliban phone calls and gave information on where Predator and Reaper drones should be deployed.

They U-2 was once the workhorse of U.S. airborne surveillance, able to fly higher and faster than any other military jet at 70,000 feet.

Glitch occurred on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m.

Despite U-2 spy plane flying at 60,000 feet, air traffic control software was unable to distinguish it from commercial aircraft

@highlight

The problem at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center, which handles higher-altitude aircraft, meant planes bound for the region were also grounded

200 flights at LAX alone were either cancelled or diverted

Other airports across the southwest were also affected
