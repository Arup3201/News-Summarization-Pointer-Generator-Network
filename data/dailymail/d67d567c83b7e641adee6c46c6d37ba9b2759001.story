Sarah Dahane was found by police yesterday morning after members of her family raised concerns for her well-being

The father of a 20-month-old toddler who was found dead at a house has spoken of the loss of his 'uniquely beautiful' daughter who meant the world to him.

The body of Sarah Dahane was found by police at a property in Bicester, Oxfordshire, yesterday morning after members of her family raised concerns for her well-being.

Her mother, who has not been named by police, is believed to have left the UK and travelled to Kenya, according to Thames Valley Police.

The girl's father, Nabil Dahane, who is separated from her mother, said in a statement released through police: 'To my uniquely beautiful Sarah: You have meant the world to me.

'The time spent with you, though has been cut very short, was an absolute joy and the sweet memories we made together will stay with me for as long as I live. May you rest in peace babe and I will surely see you in heaven. Inchallah.

A post-mortem examination carried out on the child's body, who was formally identified by her father, was inconclusive and further tests are to be carried out to establish a cause of death.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Hunter said: 'Whilst the circumstances of Sarah's death remain unexplained, we are carrying out a detailed and thorough investigation to establish exactly how and why she died.

'We are supporting Sarah's father, who is separated from her mother, with dedicated family liaison officers.

'From information available to us at this time, it would appear Sarah's mother has left the UK at some stage during Wednesday evening.

'She is believed to have travelled to Kenya. Her exact whereabouts are unknown and we are working with other authorities to establish her exact location.

'While we are working with those individuals and authorities that were in contact with both Sarah and her mother prior to her death, we urgently wish to speak to Sarah's mother to better understand exactly what has happened. We strongly urge her to present herself to the authorities.'
