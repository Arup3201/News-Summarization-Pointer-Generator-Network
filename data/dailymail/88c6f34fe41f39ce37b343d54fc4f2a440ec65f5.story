Chris Ramsey believes three wins from the last five games will be enough to secure Queens Park Rangers' top flight status.

Rangers are in the drop zone of the Barclays Premier League with 28 points as they prepare for a London derby at home to West Ham.

'If you win three games you're probably going to stay up,' said Ramsey. 'As long as we're above the line come the end of May we'll be happy. I just care if we win. I just take care of our own game. If we don't get good results it doesn't matter what they do.

Ramsey spoke of his dismay at the nature of the late defeat by Chelsea in their last game

'We know the enormity of the task ahead but you can only plan and prepare as best you can and what happens happens. We understand there is pressure in these last few games. I can't say I don't feel pressure but it depends on how you deal with it.'

He believes QPR's chances of achieving these victories from games against West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester will hinge on their an ability to kick the habit of conceding late goals, like the one which turned a draw into defeat on their last outing against Chelsea.

'It is down to a lack of continued concentration,' said Ramsey. 'The managers of other teams near the bottom would say the same. 

'Not many teams are getting slaughtered but the quality at the top end is why they're there. We're not happy with late goals. We need to stop conceding those late goals.

'We were quite frustrated at the end of the last game as we played well but didn't get a positive result. We had good form and momentum and we'd have liked to have played straight away.

'I didn't get over it quickly. We had a game-plan and we didn't do it until the end. It was more for the players who ran their legs off. When you're dealing with the players and coaches of the class of Chelsea you have to be on it and we weren't.'
