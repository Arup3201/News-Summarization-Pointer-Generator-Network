An elderly hospital consultant who allegedly fell asleep in an operating theatre during an emergency caesarian has been allowed to return to work.

Senior anaesthetist Michael Cowen's behaviour was investigated after the operating surgeon claimed he nodded off during surgery.

Hospital bosses confirmed today that an inquiry had been held but decided that the woman patient had not been put at risk by the consultant, who is understood to be aged in his 80s.

Nodding off: Senior anaesthetist Michael Cowen allegedly fell asleep during an emergency caesarian but has been allowed back to work

A hospital source, who asked not to be identified, said of Mr Cowen: 'His head was slumped on his chest and he was apparently fast asleep. He didn't even wake up when the surgeon asked him to adjust the anaesthesia.

'The surgeon was furious apparently. It happened towards the end of the operation, when the surgeon instructed Mr Cowen to do something with the anesthetic - to adjust the mixture or something similar.

'Mr Cowen did not reply and when everybody looked at him he was sitting in his chair with his head slumped forward onto his chest - sound asleep.

'The surgeon said something else and Mr Cowen still didn't wake up. In the end the surgeon had to do whatever it was himself.'

Two midwives and the surgeon involved made an official complaint to hospital chiefs after the incident earlier this year at Milton Keynes General Hospital.

The source added: 'The patient's partner was in the theatre, sitting near her head. He saw what happened and was a bit shaken. But afterwards he was so thrilled about being a new dad and so relieved the baby was alright, that he didn't want to complain.'

Abroad: Mr Cowen, who was unavailable for comment at his home today, will not be barred from returning to the hospital where the incident allegedly happened

Mr Cowen, who qualified as a doctor in 1965 and registered as an anaesthetist 12 years ago, was suspended for nine months on full pay while the investigation took place. He lives in Milton Keynes, Bucks.

This month he was allowed to return to work at the Milton Keynes hospital. He is also continuing his work as a private consultant at the nearby BMI Saxon Clinic.

Milton Keynes General Hospital's medical director, Martin Wetherill, said today: 'A concern was raised about an anaesthetist allegedly falling asleep during a caesarean section procedure.

'A full investigation into the events was conducted.

'The patient involved was not put at risk during the procedure and no concerns were raised by the patient or relatives in regard to the care they received.'

The unnamed source said: 'People have decided to speak out because of the safety aspect. How can the hospital say there was no risk to the patient when the anesthetist falls asleep?'

Mr Wetherill added that no other claims had been made against Mr Cowen.

A spokesman for the General Medical Council, which regulates anaesthetists and requires all practitioners to register with it, declined to comment on the case.

The GMC website shows that no referral has been made to it regarding Mr Cowen, who was unavailable for comment and currently on leave doing charity work in Pakistan.Â
