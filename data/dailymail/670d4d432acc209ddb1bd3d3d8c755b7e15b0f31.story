On trial: Davina Travi, 42, arrives at Bournemouth Crown Court charged with sexually assaulting two underage boys

A mother-of-five had sex with two underage boys as a reward for them vandalising a love-rival’s car, a court has heard.

Davina Travi, 42, from Bournemouth, Dorset, ‘struck a deal’ with the schoolboys aged 13 and 14 after she was dumped by her boyfriend for another woman, it is alleged.

She is said to have asked them to damage the car of his new girlfriend Stacey Allright in return for sex.

In April 2010 the teenagers found Miss Allright’s Peugeot 306 and smashed it up bringing Travi the number plate to prove they had kept their end of the deal, it was said.

Travi was 'as good as her word' and allegedly had full sex with the older boy in her bedroom before summoning the second one up.

Her children, two of whom are thought to be the same age as the victims, were not at home at the time of the alleged incidents. The court heard that after having sex with the boys Travi threw the pair out.

But she continued to keep in contact with the teenagers by sending them sexual text messages while they were at school, it was alleged.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard evidence she had been in touch with one of the boys, either by phone call or text, 548 times in the space of several months.

It was said she formulated a secret code with both boys and would text them three question marks if she wanted to have sex. She ended up bedding the younger boy at least one more time, it was claimed.

It was only when the girlfriend of one of the teenagers discovered what had happened that they were encouraged to tell a school social worker five months later.

Travi was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting the teenagers who are now 15 and 16.

Stephen Dent, prosecuting, told the court the boys were part of a group of school pupils who used to visit her house and drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes.

He said: 'Davina Travi treated children like adults. She was allowing them to drink and smoke in her house.

'That irresponsible attitude came to a peak when she decided to use them to get back at her former boyfriend by bribing them to damage his girlfriend’s car for the reward of having sex with her; a reward that she gave them.'

Mr Dent said the school later became aware Travi was hosting parties for pupils and warned other parents not to let their children go there.

He added there was no suggestion the boys had been raped and that they had been willing participants, but were not legally capable of giving their consent.

He said: 'At the age of 13 a lot of boys have hormones coursing through their veins and are perfectly capable and willing to have sex but they are mentally immature.

'They are not able to properly decide whether they should have sex and they are unable to deal with the potential consequences.'

Travi denies three charges of sexual activity with a child.

The trial continues.
