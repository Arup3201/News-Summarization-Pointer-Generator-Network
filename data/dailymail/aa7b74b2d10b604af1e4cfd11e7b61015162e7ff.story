Amber Vinson, who caught Ebola while treating the first patient diagnosed in the U.S., has revealed that her engagement ring was incinerated during the hazmat clean-up.

The 29-year-old ICU nurse said on Thursday that the ring, given to her by fiancé Derrick Markray, was destroyed along with the binder where she kept the details and arrangements for her wedding next year.

The ring was lost amid many of Miss Vinson's personal possessions at her home in Dallas, Texas, which were burned by hazmat clean-up crews to prevent the spread of Ebola.

Nurse Amber Vinson, 29, contracted Ebola last month but has since recovered from the virus.  Miss Vinson is due to marry fiancé Derrick Markray (pictured on June 22) next year. Mr Markray is a former college football star who went on to the New Orleans Saints. She admitted that she was crushed when Ebola clean-up crews destroyed her engagement ring (pictured)

She told CNN: 'I was crushed. It's a thing, but it has sentimental value to me... We've got to rebuild.'

And losing the ring may have been for nothing after infectious disease expert Dr William Schaffner told ABC that some bleach would have killed any trace of the virus which touched the jewelry. 

The nurse could look on the bright side on Friday, however, after she got a kiss and a hug from former president George W. Bush who visited her and her colleagues.

Bush dropped by Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas where he posed for pictures with dozens of delighted doctors and nurses.  

Dallas calmly marked the end of its Ebola crisis on Friday, when the last of the 177 people who were being monitored for symptoms of the deadly virus were to be cleared at midnight.

She said on Thursday that she wasn't careless or a risk-taker and defended her decision to board a flight shortly before being diagnosed. 

She described her worst days fighting the Ebola virus in a special quarantine unit as a 'blur' where she felt awful and was unsure she would survive.  

Some have criticized the ICU nurse for her decision to fly from Texas to Ohio on October 10 after she treated Duncan. 

Nurse Vinson flew to her home state for the weekend to plan for her wedding next year to former college football star Derrick Markray.  

She told Today on Thursday that she would never have put anyone at risk and  was never told by her ICU management team or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that it was unsafe to travel. 

The nurse said she was completely healthy and 'felt great' when she landed in Cleveland, Ohio, to visit her mother, Debra Berry.

She told People Magazine: 'I hung out with my mom and her dog, and we ordered pizza and relaxed. The next day, I went out to the bridal store with some of my bridesmaids and we had a great time.'

She said that while in Ohio she learned that her fellow ICU nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, had contracted Ebola and that the news 'floored her'. 

Miss Pham worked the day shift caring for Mr Duncan, a Liberian national who had traveled to the U.S. at the end of September, before Miss Vinson took over on the night shift. 

Miss Vinson said: 'I was afraid for myself, for my family, because I did everything that I was instructed to do, every time, and I felt like, ''If Nina can get it, any one of us could have gotten it.''' 

Miss Vinson said reports that she had been feeling 'weird' before she boarded her return flight  were 'completely false' and deeply hurtful.

She checked her temperature multiple times before boarding the plane and it was normal.

'I never felt ''weird,''' she said on Thursday. 'I felt fine, I felt completely normal.' 

Due to her concern, Miss Vinson called Texas Health before boarding her return flight and was once again cleared to travel.

It was only once she landed in Dallas that she discovered that she had a temperature of 100.3F and reported to the hospital. 

When her fever became worse and she developed sickness and diarrhea, Miss Vinson said she knew that she had developed Ebola. 

She told People that her mom was strong but the news deeply-affected her fiancé.

"I was sitting next to Derrick, and I saw one big tear hang from his eye and fall... I rubbed his back and then I turned around and cried,' she told People.

She said her condition initially worsened and that she prayed to God to save her life. But as she began to feel better she was able to contact family and friends via Skype and sent text messages with her colleague Nina.  

She said reports that she had traveled with Ebola symptoms had left her feeling 'terrible'.

'I'm not careless, I don't take risks. I'm an ICU nurse... I embrace protocol and guidelines because in my line of work it's a matter of life and death,' she said. 

The nurse admitted that she had not been given thorough training before treating Mr Duncan in the highly contagious stages of the Ebola virus.

She described the training to People as 'a crash-course education'.  

She said: 'We did not get much training. The first time I put on the protective equipment, I was heading in to take care of the patient. We didn't get training in putting on and taking off the equipment... so we could feel comfortable with it.'

Miss Vinson said that after treating Mr Duncan, she would dream about work and going over every little detail of her care while continually taking her temperature.  

The 29-year-old was infected while caring for Mr Duncan who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas on October 8.

She told People that his death left her 'distraught'.

She inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids, all while wearing protective gear. Ebola is only caught through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is contagious.

Miss Vinson didn't show symptoms before flying to Cleveland, Ohio on October 10.

She reported her temperature to the CDC, as part of self-monitoring guidelines, on October 13, and was cleared to fly back to Dallas.

The next day, the nurse developed a temperature, and on October 15, she tested positive for Ebola.

In Ohio, 163 people were  monitored due to contact or potential contact with Miss Vinson in a bridal shop and on flights. To date, no cases of Ebola have been reported. 

She was initially treated at her own Dallas hospital before being transferred to a specialized unit at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia. Miss Vinson received blood plasma from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly.

She was declared free of the disease on October 28 and said on Thursday that she is feeling good but gets 'a little tired as the day goes on'.

A family friend set up a GoFundMe account which has raised $20,000 for Miss Vinson.  

The nurse said that she would absolutely treat someone with Ebola again as it is her duty to take care of anyone that she sees is suffering. 

Her colleague Nina Pham, 26, who also was infected with Ebola was released on October 24 from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after being declared virus-free.
