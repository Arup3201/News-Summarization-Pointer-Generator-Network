Victorian Police hold concerns for two missing toddlers, who are believed to be with their 25-year-old mother.

Two-year-old Bodi Jordan and three-year-old Lylah Jordan were last seen on 18 August at a residence in Sale, in the Gippsland region of Victoria.

A Facebook account which appears to belong to the mother, Rebecca McGuiness, commented on the Victoria Police's Facebook post on Friday night and again on Saturday morning, insisting that she wasn’t missing, but ‘trying to escape hell’.

Police are appealing for public assistance to help locate two missing Sale children. Investigators have been told two-year-old Bodi Jordan and three-year-old Lylah Jordan were last seen at a residential house in Sale on 18 August.

A Victoria Police media contact told Daily Mail Australia that they are aware of the comments, but they ‘are still looking for the children. Nothing has changed, the children are still missing.’

Victoria Police believe the children may be travelling in taxis with their 25-year-old mother and were in Tarneit, west of Melbourne, on Friday at 7am.

It is believed the children may be travelling in taxis with their 25-year-old mother Rebecca McGuiness. Investigators hold concerns for Rebecca and the children, and appeal for them to make contact with police.

Investigators are appealing for the mother to formally make contact with them.

They have released photos of the trio ‘in the hope that someone may recognise them.’

Bodi has light brown hair and blue eyes, while Lylah has brown hair and brown eyes.

Members of the public who locate the missing persons are urged to call 000.
