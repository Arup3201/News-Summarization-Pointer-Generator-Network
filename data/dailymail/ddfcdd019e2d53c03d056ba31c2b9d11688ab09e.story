Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao scored his first international goal since November 2013 as Colombia eased past El Salvador in New Jersey.

Making his first start for his country in 11 months, Falcao, who missed the World Cup in Brazil with a serious knee injury, took just eight minutes to break the deadlock.

The 28-year-old met a Santiago Arias cross with a superb header from near the penalty spot to give Colombia the lead. ~

El Salvador worked hard throughout, and almost got themselves back in the game before half time when the score was still 1-0, but Arias cleared off the line to preserve Colombia's lead.

But, in a match Los Cafeteros dominated, Sevilla striker Carlos Bacca scored twice, from a combined distance of no more than four yards, as the El Salvador defence crumbled after the break.

The first of Bacca's goals, just four minutes after half time, saw the striker smash the ball home from barely a yard out after some calamitous defending.

Then, just three minutes later, he was able to sneak in, again inside the six yard box, to ensure a Falcao knock-down ended up in the back of the net.

After the game Colombia boss Jose Pekerman paid tribute to his returning captain Falcao, and said it was important for the striker to get back on the scoresheet for his country.

'I think we're happy to be able watch Falcao once again score a goal with the national team,' said Pekerman. 'We were hoping that it was going to happen. And that's very important tonight.'

Colombia will face Canada in their next friendly on Tuesday, while El Salvador take on Ecuador.
