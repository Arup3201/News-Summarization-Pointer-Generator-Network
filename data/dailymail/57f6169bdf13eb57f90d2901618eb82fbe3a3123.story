A retired NYPD deputy inspector has revealed his shocking ties to violent gangs and drug-dealing before he joined the force.

Retired officer Corey Pegues admitted that he once attempted murder and was good friends with a notorious, cop-killing crack dealer. 

Mr Pegues revealed his dark secrets on a podcast last month as part of the promotion for his upcoming book, From The Streets To The Beat - much to the anger of fellow officers.

The statute of limitations has handily expired on 45-year-old Mr Pegues' alleged crimes meaning he is beyond the reach of any court, leaving him to enjoy his $135,000 disability pension (which is also tax free). 

Mr Pegues left the police force at the age of 45 in 2013, after more than 20 years service. He had reached the rank of deputy inspector at the 67th Precinct in East Flatbush.

He publicly shared the years that he spent in the drug and gang underworlds in his teens and early twenties in Queens, according to the New York Post.  

During the interview, Pegues said he had been on the streets since the age of 13 when he began selling loose joints to help provide for his family.

'In the late 80s, it almost seemed like the thing to do,' he told the show.

Pegues said that he always traveled 'strapped' as a young teen - carrying a .22 nickel-plated gun.  

The former cop also admitted how close he had come to killing a rival drug-dealer - but his weapon misfired. He told the podcast: 'I was maybe like 17. I was like, ''Yo, I’m going to murder him''... It was all about street cred.'

He also claimed that he trusted no one on the streets as that was the best way to survive after bragging about owning piles of expensive trainers and gold chains with his name in diamonds.

Pegues, who is married and has a daughter in the NYPD, revealed he was friends with cop killer David McClary. 

McClary shot rookie cop Eddie Byrne, who was alone in a squad car  in February 1988, protecting the home of a witness in a drug case who had been threatened by dealers. 

The retired cop revealed in an interview last month that he was friends with cop-killer David McClary who shot dead rookie officer Eddie Byrne while he was protecting a witness's home in 1988 

It was about 3am and he was alone at the wheel when five bullets were pumped into his head.

Days earlier, a powerful drug dealer had ordered a hit from jail on any cop as payback for his arrest and offered $8,000 as a reward. 

Pegues also used his interview to say that he believed Eric Garner - who died after being put in a chokehold by a Staten Island cop in July - was murdered. 

He said: 'I'm a cop with 22 years service and for the record, Eric Garner was murdered.' 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the NYPD today but on a popular cop website, The Rant, one user posted the podcast and wrote: 'If you can stomach this interview it starts at around the 13:00 minute mark. 

'He talks about running with a gang, selling drugs and even witnessing murder. Amazing that this perp was a DI. What an embarrassment to the department.'

The NYPD has a strict vetting process for new employees but since Pegues sailed through unnoticed, he presumably was not charged with any crime and kept his past a secret. 

Pegues, an NYPD inspector with 22 years service who recently retired, is currently promoting his new book about his time as a teenage gang-banger
