A daughter who had to identify the bodies of her mother and sister who were shot by a puppy farmer has said she sees them 'every time she shuts her eyes'. 

John Lowe, 82, was found guilty of murdering 66-year-old Christine Lee and her daughter Lucy Lee, 40, with his shotgun at his home near Farnham, Surrey, in February and sentenced to life imprisonment at Guildford Crown Court today.

Stacey Banner, daughter of Christine Lee and sister of Lucy, criticised Surrey Police after it emerged a number of Lowe's guns were returned to him just months before he carried out the shootings.

In a statement read to the court, Ms Banner said she was 'haunted' by her mother and sister's murders and her grief 'came crashing down' when she had to identify their bodies.

'Every time I close my eyes I see them,' she said. 'I have nightmares. I'm haunted by what John did to them.'

Ms Banner said counselling had not helped her and her relationship with her husband had suffered.

In another statement read by the prosecutor, Christine Lee's sister Julia James said she had felt 'physically and emotionally weak' since the deaths.

'Christine and Lucy were lovely people - kind, witty and generous,' she said. 'I miss them more than I can say.' 

Sentencing Lowe to life imprisonment, Mr Justice Singh praised the 'extraordinary courage' of Lucy Lee, who returned to face her killer following a frantic 999 call on the day of the shootings.

Lowe, flanked by three security officers, winked at those seated in the public gallery as he was brought into the dock.

Jailing him, the judge said: 'Having heard the evidence at your trial, I have come to the conclusion that you did have an intention to kill both Christine Lee and Lucy Lee rather than to cause them serious bodily harm.

'I form that view because of the close range with which you used the shotgun, firing at their chests.

'I also form that view because in statements which you made to the police after the incident you said that you had to "put them down".' 

Elderly Lowe was also convicted of murdering Mrs Lee's 40-year-old daughter Lucy Lee (pictured)

Ian Lawrie QC, mitigating, said his client was 'highly likely' to die during his sentence and Lowe had perceived his two victims as 'his jailers.'

'For several months prior to the deaths of these ladies, there were difficulties in Mr Lowe's life,' he said.

'The tragic death of Miss (Susan) Wilson (Lowe's long-term partner)... and over the pursuing months he experienced a decline in his personal affairs, business affairs and in life generally.'

Mr Lawrie said the difficulties in Lowe's life could 'possibly explain why he erupted in anger and committed these terrible acts'.

He added: 'The reality is, whatever term is given, he is going to die in prison.'

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Singh said: ' On the morning of Sunday 23 February you lost your temper and took your shotgun out of its locked cabinet and used it to kill Christine Lee.

'She died of a single shotgun wound to the chest fired at close range from above.

'Lucy Lee was able to use her mobile phone to make a frantic and desperate call to the emergency services on 999.

'She said that you had shot her mum and she feared that you were going to shoot her as well.

'Nevertheless in an act of extraordinary courage, she went back; no doubt to see if there was anything she could do to help her mother.

'You then used the shotgun to shoot her twice, once to the back of the head and then fatally to the chest, again from an angle from above.In the meantime you must have had to reload your weapon because it had two barrels.' 

Lowe - pictured with dogs at his puppy farm - initially told police he had to 'put down' his victims, but later claimed the killings were an accident. He was found guilty of murder this week

After sentence was passed there was an outburst from the public gallery with a woman screaming: 'What about all the animals he has killed.'

Mr Justice Singh was forced to ask for quiet so that he could express his condolences to the families of the victims.

Grieving Stacy Banner sobbed loudly with her head in her hands as Lowe was led down to the cells.

Speaking on the steps of the court today, she spoke of her relief that it was 'all over,' after Lowe was sentenced for the murder of her mother and sister.

'I am just relieved that it is all over. He (John Lowe) is never getting out and he can never hurt anyone again.' 

Friends of Lowe heckled her as she made the brief statement.

Armed police arrived at Keepers Cottage Stud puppy farm on February 23, where they found the two women dead.

The trial heard that Lowe told officers the women 'treated me like s***', accusing them of starving him and trying to put him in a home so they could take his land.

He told one officer: 'They had to be put down. There was nothing else I could do. I have had terrible problems with Christine. They have not let me eat.'

It was only later that he began to tell police that their deaths were accidental. 

The double murder took place on February 23 this year off a quiet country lane in rural Surrey

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an investigation into why police officers repeatedly ignored the danger posed by Lowe and gave him back his lethal weapons.

In 1997, a registered police informant told a special squad that Lowe had tried to hire him as a hitman to kill his then-partner, Susan Wilson, who later died of cancer.

Lowe, who will have his 83rd birthday in jail in two weeks, was not questioned and no action was taken against him.

Then, just months before the bloodbath at his ramshackle Surrey farm, the 82-year-old had threatened to kill step-daughter Stacy Banner.

Police confirmed they removed Lowe's guns from his farm in March 2013, after she reported the threats.

But his seven shotguns - including the weapon used in the murders - were then returned to him in July after he was deemed fit to have a firearm. 

Speaking earlier this week, Ms Banner said: 'John Lowe pulled the trigger but it was the Surrey Police who put the gun in his hands.'

She said her sister and mother did not stand a chance when they were 'brutally and deliberately murdered' at close range with a shotgun.

'The shotgun was one of seven that had been returned to him by the police only months before he used it kill,' she added.

'He held a shotgun licence despite the police being repeatedly warned by me and others about the danger he posed to society, allowing him to kill and kill again. Surrey Police should not be allowed to escape their responsibility for these deaths.'
