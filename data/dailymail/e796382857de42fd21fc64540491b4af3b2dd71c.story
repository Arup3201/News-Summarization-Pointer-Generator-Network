A family friend charged with killing a baby girl and her grandmother told police he dropped the baby as he wielded a knife and the grandmother charged at him during a botched kidnapping, authorities said Friday.

Raghunandan 'Raghu' Yandamuri, a native of India, targeted the family for a $50,000 ransom because he knew both parents worked, and he left copies of a ransom note, according to a police affidavit filed in suburban Philadelphia.

'It's up to you to decide, do you want your one-year-old or five months of your income?' the lengthy note said.

Raghunandan 'Raghu' Yandamuri, a native of India, targeted the family for a $50,000 ransom because he knew both parents worked

Ten copies of the note were left at the family's apartment, but no one ever contacted the baby's parents, both software engineers, after the grandmother was found dead Monday and the baby went missing.

Authorities instead found the body of 10-month-old Saanvi Venna in a bloody white dress early Friday beneath a bench in a basement fitness room at the sprawling apartment complex where Yandamuri and the victims lived.

The 26-year-old Yandamuri, interviewed Thursday as police canvassed the family's friends, had told officers where to find the body, District Attorney Risa Ferman said.

Investigators had hoped to find Saanvi alive even as the week wore on. But she may have been dead before she left the apartment, Ferman said.

Yandamuri told police that he put a handkerchief in her mouth to quiet her, tied a towel around her head and put her in a suitcase before he left, according to the affidavit.

Yandamuri was being held without bail on two counts of murder, kidnapping, robbery and other charges pending a preliminary hearing next week. He does not have a lawyer and did not enter a plea at a brief arraignment Friday afternoon.

The murders occurred at this apartment block in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County

He told a judge he is not a U.S. citizen and was given time to make a private call to the Indian consulate.

The baby's father, Venkata Konda Siva Venna, and mother, Chenchu Latha Punuru, moved to the United States from India in February 2007 and moved into the apartment in June. The ransom note referred to them by family nicknames, leading police to hone in on friends and acquaintances.

The paternal grandmother, 61-year-old Satyavathi Venna, arrived from India in July and was scheduled to return home in January.

She opened the door to Yandamuri on Monday morning only to see he was armed with a kitchen knife, authorities said. She retreated to the kitchen, while he picked up the baby from the couch, the affidavit said.

Investigators believe Saanvi may have been dead before she left the apartment

Yandamuri told police he dropped the 
baby and the grandmother came toward him and walked into the knife, 
leaving a deep gash in her throat, the affidavit said.

Yandamuri,
who lived in a different building than the parents, told police that he
had printed nearly 200 missing-child posters at work, distributed them 
and attended a vigil for the baby.

But
he later detailed the botched crime to police and said he had stolen 
jewelry, some of which he threw in the nearby Schuylkill River, the 
affidavit said.

A throng of
people jeered at him, shouting 'Hang him!' and other taunts, as he was 
led into court Friday afternoon in a bulletproof vest.

'We had been hopeful that Saanvi was still alive,' said Ferman, the prosecutor. 'Tragically, that is not the case.'
