An allotment holder who tends to his plot all year round has been landed with  an eviction order - because he took a fortnight off.

Robert Stone, who has tended to the plot for the past eight years, received a  letter from the council giving him a month's notice on the tenancy after  claiming he was not 'cultivating the plot to the required standards'.

The 64-year-old grandfather admits he took a two-week break from tending his plot in Scotchman Road allotments, Manningham, BradfordÂ - but only because of heavy storms and rain.

He said: 'For about two weeks we couldn't get on to the ground at all. There had  been a lot of wet and stormy weather and it would have done more harm than good.'

Facing eviction: Robert Stone, 64, received a letter from Bardford City Council telling him he is being evicted from his allotment for failing to 'cultivate the plot to the required standards'

Keen gardener: Mr Stone says he tends his allotment all year round - growing vegetables and herbs - but admits to having had two weeks off over winter when heavy gales meant he couldn't work on the plot

Mr Stone responded to the letter with a detailed 
account of the  vegetables grown on the plot and fruit trees that his 
wife Wendy uses to make jams,  but received no response from Bradford 
City Council.

He added: 'After I received the notice I worked the land for two days and dug up some  plants to give them away.

'The land was 80 per cent cultivated anyway because we grow a  lot of fruit and flowers for the house. I took photographs to show the  condition after two days but have had no response.

'In the first instance I thought it was a genuine mistake. I thought they've  got the wrong allotment and that it would be sorted out. But after sending two  emails I've heard nothing from the council and as far as I'm aware the notice  still stands.'

The letter sent to Mr Stone, an aerial and satellite rigger, who grows a vast array of herbs, fruits and vegetables on the plot, also had three photos attached to support the eviction.

But Mr Stone said the pictures were taken
 during the winter when the allotment was dormant, with  some photos 
actually showing an overgrown tree outside the boundaries of his  plot.

He
 added: 'The pictures they took were just dried plants, which you can't 
do anything  about in the winter. The council must have come to plot on 
the first dry day of  the year to take the photograph.

Working progress: Mr Stone has been slowly cultivating his plot over the course of eight years

Stunned: Mr Stone initially thought his eviction notice must be a mistake after receiving this letter from Bradford City Council

Evidence: Bradford City Council attached three images with the letter as proof that the plot in Scotchman Road allotments, Manningham, was not being 'cultivated'

'I get a lot of
 use from the allotment and my grandchildren love it too. They  don't 
come to help, they come to eat peas off the pod and grow sunflowers. I  
just don't want to lose it.'

Mr Stone said he will do everything he can to keep the plot which has become a 'huge part' of his life.

He said: 'The letter broke my spirit, if I'm honest. I've had no response from  the Council, and the thought of having to leave is absolutely devastating.

'At the moment I am digging my heels in until someone puts pen to paper and  informs me what's happening.

'I plan to fight my cause, but I hope common sense will prevail. I feel  helpless. I'm just an ordinary man who enjoys growing and planting things, but  I'm here every week, and my allotment is a huge part of my life.'

The Council has said it has revamped its allotment services, speeding up the  process of transforming derelict or vacant sites to reduce waiting lists.

Devastated: Mr Stone, pictured in his plot, goes to the allotment every week and says he doesn't want to lose such a 'huge part' of his life

Waiting game: Mr Stone has sent a letter of appeal to the council but has still not been told whether it was successful

But Jane Robinson, from the Bradford Community Environment Project, which  allocates temporary starter plots at the Scotchman Road allotments in  Manningham, said that while recent improvements in certain council services had  been welcomed, communication problems still existed.

'We all want uncultivated plots to be moved on swiftly, but the process has to  be effective,' she said.

'This case emphasises how important it is to be careful and get things right. Some long-standing plot holders who have received warnings about their level  of cultivation felt the letters were both unprecedented and heavy-handed.'

Belinda Gaynor, Bradford Council's operational estate manager, said 32  tenancies had been terminated so far during 2013/14, with approximately ten of  those evictions leading to appeals.

'There are waiting lists for council allotments and we have a duty to make sure  that those who have plots are actually working them,' she said.

Prior to any termination notice being issued plot holders are given a written  warning and advised that improvement is required.

Ms Gaynor continued: 'The termination of Mr Stone's tenancy will be put on hold to allow time for  his appeal to be determined.'
