Poland's Michal Kwiatkowski stole the men's road race title in a gruelling battle at the World Road Championships in Spain.

The 24-year-old double European champion picked the perfect time to strike for the lead, on the final climb, to claim world title glory.

The Polish all-rounder then drove for the finish on an extended descent, able to hold the lead he had boldly wrestled in the final stages.

Kwiatkowski slowed to the finish line after his punishing finish, eventually pipping Gerrans by one second in the official timings.

Britain's Ben Swift kept himself in contention for much of the race in Ponferrada, but the 26-year-old was unable to stay the course and wound up in a photo-finish for 12th place.

Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara just pipped Swift into 11th.

Nicolas Roche came home in 26th place for Ireland.
