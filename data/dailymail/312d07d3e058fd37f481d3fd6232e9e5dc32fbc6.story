Disgraced Silvio Berlusconi has launched a furious attack against the Italian justice system after a  supreme court ruling upheld a tax fraud conviction against the billionaire.

The decision yesterday has left the fate of Italy's fragile ruling coalition in the balance - although Berlusconi's supporters said the government would not be brought down.

The 76-year-old reacted angrily to the decision by the supreme court to reject a final appeal against his conviction, protesting his innocence and accusing magistrates of persecuting him since his entry into politics 20 years ago.

Disgraced: Silvio Berlusconi launched a furious attack against the Italian justice system after a supreme court ruling which upheld a tax fraud conviction against the billionaire

Furious: The 76-year-old protested his innocence and accused magistrates of persecuting him since his entry into politics 20 years ago

The ruling, confirming a sentence for tax fraud involving inflated invoices at his Mediaset broadcasting empire, was the first definitive sentence he had received after dozens of previous trials on charges ranging from tax to sex offences.

In a video message broadcast on Italian television after the verdict last night, he said: 'No one can understand the real violence which has been directed against me.

'A genuine campaign of aggression that has no equal.'

Just three months after centre-left Prime Minister Enrico Letta took 
office at the head of an uneasy coalition with Berlusconi's People of 
Freedom party (PDL), Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, is 
again mired in uncertainty.

Berlusconi is unlikely to have to serve any time in jail because of his age. The supreme court ordered part of the original sentence - imposing a ban on holding political office - to be reviewed. But the ruling has dealt an unprecedented blow to the man who has dominated Italian politics for two decades.

Berlusconi said he would continue his
political activities under the 'Forza Italia' (Go Italy!) name of his 
first party and press for a reform of the justice system, but he made no
direct reference to the future of the coalition with Letta.

Senior
allies also reacted with bitterness, but also said the ruling would not
bring down the coalition between Letta's centre-left Democratic Party 
and Berlusconi's People of Freedom.

'This
sentence will not affect the Letta government, which was created to 
serve the country and which will continue to serve it as far as we are 
concerned,' former Justice Minister Nitto Palma said after a meeting in 
Berlusconi's Rome residence.

Berlusconi has faced 20 years of 
legal skirmishes and at least two dozen trials since entering politics 
in 1994, but all previous convictions have been thrown out, overturned 
on appeal or timed out.

But yesterday, Italy’s highest court 
handed the billionaire media magnate a four-year jail sentence for using
offshore companies to dodge Italian taxes in the acquisition of 
Hollywood films for his TV networks.

However, under an amnesty law, this 
has been reduced to one year – a punishment he will most likely serve 
under house arrest or through community service.

Meanwhile, judges refused to uphold a five-year ban from public office, instead sending it back for judicial review.

This means that for now Berlusconi, 
who has no official role in government, can continue leading his 
centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party and sitting as a senator in 
Parliament.

'Honour and solidarity with Silvio Berlusconi, who is certainly more innocent and clean than those who unjustly condemned him'

He is expected to be placed under 
house arrest from October, which will prevent him from attending. Even 
with this restriction he will remain an MP, pending the review of his 
ban.

Berlusconi, who has always claimed he 
is the victim of a left-wing conspiracy among the judiciary, was not in 
court but awaited the news at home.

Members of the PDL, which is in an 
uneasy coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party, have threatened 
to bring down the government in retaliation for a conviction.

Luca D’Alessandro, an MP in 
Berlusconi’s party, said: ‘Honour and solidarity with Silvio Berlusconi,
who is certainly more innocent and clean than those who unjustly 
condemned him’.
