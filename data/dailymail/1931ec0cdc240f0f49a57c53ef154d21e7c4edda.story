A masked bandit forced an Amish horse and buggy off a road and robbed them at gunpoint.

Three people were travelling along East Eby Road, near Leola, Pennsylvania, in the buggy at 12.40am on Monday when a white minivan suddenly pulled into their, forcing the driver to stop.

A bandit, who had his face covered, jumped out of the van wielding a gun and demanding money, police say.

Many Amish communities shun modern technology - including phones, the internet and even cars - making horse-drawn buggies a popular mode of transport (file picture)

The man held the horse and buggy's three passengers at gunpoint just south of Leola, Pennsylvania

East Lampeter Township police say the three occupants threw their wallets to him, before the buggy driver quickly steered into a field to escape.

The gunman got back into the minivan and drove away west, Lancaster Online reported.

No one was injured in the incident.

East Lampeter Police  urged anyone with information on the attack to come forward.

More than 200,000 Amish people live in the USA, and speak Pennsylvania Dutch - a form of German.

Most  families shun modern technology, including cars, making horse-drawn buggies a popular mode of transport.

Phones, the internet and electricity are also banned in older Amish communities, although there is variation in different areas, with some allowing modern technology to help with work and medical care. 

Horses are still used for farm work and getting around, but some Amish families hire taxis or vans to help carry groceries home if they live out of town (file picture)
