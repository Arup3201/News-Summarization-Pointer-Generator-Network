A report said had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Rigby’s murder could have been avoided

The family of Lee Rigby today accused Facebook of failing to help stop his killers as it emerged the social network has still not handed over data from five accounts opened by one of his extremist murderers. 

His sister Sara said the internet giant had ‘blood on its hands’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier’s murderers and an Al Qaeda extremist, in which the former said: ‘Let’s kill a soldier.’

However, the social network’s staff failed to tell MI5 about the ‘graphic and emotive’ posts from Michael Adebowale, made just six months before the atrocity took place.  

Incredibly, Facebook had already disabled seven of his accounts – five of which were flagged over links to extremism – without informing security services. 

The damning report by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee released yesterday also revealed that Adebowale had 11 Facebook accounts but GCHQ has still only been given the contents of six.

It said in 'over a year since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, GCHQ has not received all the information requested. Having not seen the content of the other five accounts, GCHQ cannot be certain that there is no evidence of attack planning in the rest of these accounts'. 

But civil liberties campaigners fear Drummer Rigby's appalling murder is being used as 'an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population'. 

And former MI6 director Richard Barratt said today it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for businesses like Facebook to hand over  terror related activity to the security services.

He told the Today programme: 'I think it's unfair to ask companies to make that decision. I think there has to be a legal basis for them so they know what they are to do and what not do to'.

Barrett added it was 'almost impossible' because of 'legalities' and because there are 125million posts a day on Facebook passing on terror-related posts would be an 'enormous job'.

Fusilier Rigby’s sister, Sara McClure, 25, said: ‘Facebook have my brother’s blood on their hands. I hold them partly responsible for Lee’s murder.

'I suppose it has given me someone to blame but I’m not sure that’s what I wanted. Knowing it could have been prevented and it wasn’t prevented. I blame the failings of MI5 and the internet companies. Mainly the internet companies’

Response: Former MI6 director Richard Barratt said it would be 'almost impossible' and 'unfair' for  Facebook to hand over terror related activity but David Cameron claims: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this'

In a long-awaited report, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee yesterday said that had MI5 known about Adebowale’s messages, Fusilier Rigby’s murder could have been avoided.

And in a damning indictment of US-based tech firms, it said the same mistakes could have been made by websites run by Google, Yahoo, Apple, Twitter or Microsoft, which have become a ‘haven’ for terrorists. 

Lee Rigby's step-father Ian said: ‘We are left with questions. The report doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. It has brought back memories - A lot of the feelings are back and it doesn’t give the correct information as to the reason the delays happened. 

‘The companies’ duty of care to its customers is to use information like that if necessary when the discover it'.  

David Cameron said the internet companies – once frequently courted by his government – were being ‘used to plot murder and mayhem’, adding: ‘It is their social responsibility to act on this ... we expect them to live up to it.’

The murdered soldier's family said today that the Prime Minister is the only person with the answers they need.

Ian Rigby said: 'He's the only one who has the full report and probably the only one who could get the answers that we want'.

Background: Adebowale had fewer convictions than Adebolajo but it was his interest in extremist material and posts on Facebook that has sparked debate over whether social networks should have told MI5 and MI6

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said today: ‘Any meeting they ask for they will get.’ 

Talking about the affect his brutal murder had on his family he said: ‘When we are together as a family we laugh about memories of Lee. But we all have difficulty  talking about the murder and what has happened since. We are a normal family drawn into this situation.

‘We have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn Lee. 

'The loss of Lee will never go away. You learn to live with it over time, but it's still with you over time.

Former home secretary Jack Straw said there was a ‘cultural problem amongst the leadership of some of these [sites] who have got a distorted libertarian ideology, who believe that somehow this allows them to be wholly detached from responsibility’.

Miss McClure told The Sun newspaper: ‘It is totally clear from this report that information so vital could have alerted our security services to this terror plot.’

The ISC criticised both MI5 and MI6 for a string of blunders when tracking Fusilier Rigby’s killers, Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo – but, controversially, it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time, they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder. This is despite the fact that:

An application for intrusive surveillance on Adebowale in 2013 took ‘nearly twice as long as it should have’ amid internal wrangling by MI5. Home Secretary Theresa May signed the warrant only after Fusilier Rigby was dead.

However, the ISC’s 191-page report also highlights an exchange on Facebook between Adebowale and a fanatic since codenamed FOXTROT. Adebowale expressed his desire to murder a soldier in retaliation for UK military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was advised on different methods of murder.

Announcing £130million in funding to help the fight against ‘self-starting’ terrorists, the Prime Minister declared: ‘We must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the authorities or the internet companies themselves. Their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem.’

But Isabella Sankey of Liberty said: ‘The ISC shamefully spins the facts, seeking to blame [websites] for not doing the agencies’ work for them.’

Executive director Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: 'To pass the blame to internet companies is to use Fusilier Rigby’s murder to make cheap political points.

'The committee should not use the appalling murder of Fusilier Rigby as an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population,' he said.

A senior internet industry source told the Independent there has been a 'coordinated' attempt by the security services 'to attack US-based technology companies in particular'. 

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear – we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.’
