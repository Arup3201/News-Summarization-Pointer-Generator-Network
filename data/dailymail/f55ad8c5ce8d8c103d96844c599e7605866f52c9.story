A cruel comment from a school boy over her weight has prompted a teacher to lose almost nine stone.

Claire Mills, 31, was mortified when she
overheard students poking fun at her size, with one pupil calling her an 'upside down king prawn' because he'd 'keep the head but throw away the body.'

'Hearing that comment broke my heart, but it gave me the motivation I needed to shift the flab,' said Claire,  from Llandrindod, Powys.

Who's laughing now? Claire Mills lost nearly nine stone after hearing school children mocking her size

The mum-of-one was a size 26 and tipped the scales at almost 18 and a half stone at her heaviest. But after cutting out comfort food 
and taking up jogging, she has shed almost nine 
stone - and now weighs just over 10 stone.

She said: 'I was always one of the bigger children in school, and as I got older, I became very conscious of my size. I was so much bigger than all my friends, but I never had the motivation to do anything to change the way I looked.

'I got upset about it, so I'd stay in at night, sitting on the sofa, eating comfort food.'

Claire said her weight then crept up further after she married husband, Darren and had a daughter, Jessica.

'When I met Darren, a farmer, and got 
married, I was so happy, I couldn't believe that someone would want me 
to be their wife - so I didn't worry about losing weight then either,' she explained. 'And when I fell pregnant in 2008, I took that as licence to eat whatever I liked.

'I was so unhappy with myself when 
Jessica was born though, I refused to have my photo taken with her - I 
really regret that I only have a handful of snaps of us together when 
she was a baby.'

The teacher also found her size was affecting her work. Part of her job as a Duke of Edinburgh Development Officer involved 
accompanying groups of young people on Duke of Edinburgh expeditions. But 
she couldn't keep up with her pupils on the outdoor treks and had to 
completely rule out fun activities like canoeing.

'King prawn': A pupil said he would 'keep the head but throw away the body' when Claire looked like this, prompting her to lose weight

She said: 'I love my job, being outdoors with the 
children, and I wouldn't change it for the world - but I was so big I 
couldn't do it properly.

'My job also involves a lot of driving 
round the country to different sites, so I'd always have plenty of 
sweets and sandwiches in the car for when I got bored.'

It
was on one of these trips that Claire heard some children mocking her 
figure and that finally gave her the push she needed to lose weight.

'One day I overheard a group of 
boys talking about me. They didn't know I was there, and they were 
laughing about how fat I was,' she recalled.

'One of them said: "Her face is alright,
but you wouldn't want the body. She's like an upside down prawn - keep 
the head, chuck away the rest."

'I pretended I hadn't heard, and carried
on as normal, but when I got home I broke down in floods of tears. I 
realised I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my 
health, my family and my pride.'

Claire signed up with the Cambridge Weight Loss plan which restricts dieters to eating only soups and shakes for a set period
of time.

'The first week of sticking to the plan 
was really tough - but I soon realised that once I stopped thinking 
about what I was going to have for tea every night, and obsessing about 
food, it didn't matter that much,' she said.

New wardrobe needed: The teacher once tipped the scales at almost 18-and-a-half stone but is now a size ten

'Once it was time for me to reintroduce 
healthy cooked meals back into my diet, food wasn't such a big issue for
me, and I'd lost so much weight, I wasn't going to spoil it by eating 
takeaways every night.'

As the pounds fell off, Claire then took up running and two years after being spurred into action, she is now 
thrilled to be able to slip into a size 10 dress.

Health kick: Claire said she hasn't been happier since losing weight as she can now be a more active wife and mother to husband Darren and daughter Jessica

She said she couldn't be happier with her new figure.

'It wasn't long before people at work started to notice the difference in me, and I was soon the talk of the village.

'My little girl looks at pictures of me 
now from a few years ago and doesn't recognise me. It's wonderful to be 
able to do so much with her now.

She added: 'My husband, Darren, has been so supportive of me - he'd love me no matter what I look like, but he's pleased there is a bit more room for him in the bed now!'I feel so much better for being fitter and healthier - losing weight is the best thing I've ever done.'
