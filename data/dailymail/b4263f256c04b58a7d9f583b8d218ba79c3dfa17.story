The 28-year-old is modelling high street store's collection of occasionwear

It's no wonder Elettra Wiedemann has supermodel looks. Her mother is the model and actress Isabella Rossellini, her grandmother the beautiful Swedish film star Ingrid Bergman.

And now, Elettra has lent her excellent genes to high street store Coast, who have just signed the model as the face of their new spring/summer collection.

The model showcases the store's new collection of occasionwear, which will be sold in the brand's new flagship store, set to open on London's Oxford Street on 28 June.

Dress, £195, sizes 6-18; hair clip, £20 for two; clutch, £100 (available from flagship store only from June), and Sandals, £75, sizes 4-8, all Coast

Coast said they had selected the model thanks not only to her natural radiance, but also for her 'impeccable' pedigree.

'Her natural, timeless beauty and radiance aligns perfectly with the contemporary glamour of Coast,' they said.

'We chose Elettra for her flawless style and impeccable fashion lineage.'

Indeed, Elettra has seen her career go from strength to strength since landing her first modelling job at the age of 18, for youth clothing brand Abercrombie & Fitch.

She has since appeared in ads for Bill Blass, Ferragamo and Samsonite, and walked the runway at global fashion week shows.

Dress, £275, sizes 6-16; Hair clips, £18 each; Bracelets, £40 each (available from flagship store only from June), and Sandals, £75, sizes 4-8, all Coast

And since 2006 she has been a spokesmodel for Lancome, appearing in a number of their advertising campaigns. 

Like many of her contemporaries, Elettra has graced the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar - but she has talents that lie far beyond her ability to look good in a frock.

Thanks to her Italian heritage, Elettra has a passion for food, and each New York fashion week opens up a pop-up restaurant called GOODNESS at the city's Columbus Center where she feeds up her peers and fashion industry folk during the week's events.

The food is conjured up courtesy of the Big Apple's celebrity chefs including Mario Batali, Julian Medina, and Alain Allegretti, who all take a night each.

And in addition to coordinating the social calendar for the city's fashionistas, she also finds time to dedicate herself to good causes too, with environmental issues particularly close to her heart.

All this and a conscience too. She really is a supermodel. Someone get that girl a cape.

Then and now: Elettra's first modelling job was for photographer Bruce Weber who chose her for a campaign he shot for Abercrombie & Fitch when she was 18 years old. Right, Elettra at a Dior show earlier this year
