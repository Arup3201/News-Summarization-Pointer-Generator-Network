A high school football team achieved a feat considered almost impossible in the sport, after the ball bounced off a defender's helmet to score a freak 'own goal'.

On an extra point attempt, kicker Keegen Hemenway was disappointed when the ball came out low and looked likely to land well below the crossbar.

But to his surprise - and that of everyone watching - the ball slammed into a defender's head before bouncing off and sailing through the uprights.

The lucky bounce took the Dell Rapids a 38-0 lead over their South Dakota rivals Milbank High School. Clearly, their luck didn't end there as the Dell Rapids went on to win the game 51-0.

A video of Keegen scoring the lucky extra point has gone viral on YouTube, with close to 400,000 views.

Big Sioux Media’s Matt Larson had live-streamed the game and realized that he had recorded a once in a lifetime play and immediately posted the clip online.

Although relatively common in soccer, an 'own goal' is almost unheard of in American football. 

Milbank High School were already trailing 37-0 when kicker Keegen Hemenway lined up for the extra point

'I didn't know how to react,' Keegen, an 18-year old in his senior year, told the Dell Rapids Tribune. 'Once they said it was good, I was just pumped. As long as it gets through (the goal posts) it counts.'

Keegen said he was shocked by the surprise goal but added that his classmates think it's a bigger deal that he does.

'They won't stop talking about it,' he told the paper. 'People will come up to me and say 'Hey, you're famous.' But it was just one play.'

Since play like this is so rare, there was some confusion initially whether the extra point should be allowed
