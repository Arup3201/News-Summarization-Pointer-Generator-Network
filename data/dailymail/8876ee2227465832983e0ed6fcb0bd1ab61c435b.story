Outrage: Uriel Landeros, who defaced a valuable Pablo Picasso painting has been given his own art exhibition

A vandal who sprayed graffiti over a valuable Pablo Picasso painting has been handed his own art exhibition.

The Cueto James Gallery in Houston sparked outrage among the art community by offering a show to 22-year-old Uriel Landeros.

In June this year Landeros was charged with felony graffiti and felony criminal mischief after allegedly defacing Picasso's 1929 artwork 'Woman in a Red Armchair', worth several million dollars, as it hung on a gallery wall at Houston's Menil Collection.

A video posted on YouTube showed a man holding a stencil up to the work of art and spray-painting it, leaving behind an image of a bullfighter, a bull and the word 'conquista,' Spanish for conquest.

Cueto James Art Gallery owner James Perez said he found the incident 'inspiring' and expects a full house for tonight's opening of 12 works by Landeros.

He said: 'It made me happy that someone could evoke this kind of emotion in people,' Perez said.

'It's just taking something and making it your own. I like what Uriel did. That it makes it yours.'

But the claim that act was in itself a work of art has provoked fury among the arts community.

'You don't destroy someone else's artwork and call that art,' said artist Mitch Cohen, an arts promoter and founder of the First Saturday Arts Market. 'I've never seen such a backlash against a show.'

And Kristen Kramlich, who creates 
jewelry and sculptures, said: 'It's all about the sensationalism and 
that's what (Landeros is) riding on and that's what the gallery is 
riding on.'

Perez denied the show is meant to draw attention to himself, saying: 'I'm already popular. This is for Uriel.'

Art
community members also say it's galling to see so much attention being 
paid to this show when local gallery shows usually escape widespread 
notice.

'The greatest 
gallery exhibit in history would not get this publicity,' said Houston 
art blogger Robert Boyd, who noted he'd not heard of Landeros prior to 
the vandalism charge.

Andree
Bober, director of Landmarks, a public art program at the University of
Texas at Austin, said this vandalism incident isn't unique.

'It's not a new statement. It's a derivative one,' she said.

Earlier this month, a second art vandal 
scrawled graffiti on a mural by modern American master Mark Rothko at 
London's Tate Modern.

Perez said Landeros will speak with 
attendees via Skype at Friday's gallery opening, but that the fugitive 
artist would not speak with the media until then.

Perez said that he expects 200-300 people to stream through his 3,000-square-foot gallery Friday night to see paintings that he deems 'revolutionary' in subject matter. One painting is of a half-skeletal person.

Landeros, who Perez says is in Mexico, posted a video on YouTube in August in which he explains that he didn't intend to 'destroy Pablo's painting or to insult the Menil.'

He said if he wanted to destroy it, he would have slashed it with a knife or burned it. Landeros also claimed the Picasso could be restored with 'a little bit of Windex.'

Menil spokeswoman Gretchen Sammons said the institution had no comment on the show. She said restoration is still under way on the piece and they expect 'a full recovery.'

Donna Hawkins, a Harris County assistant district attorney, said Landeros faces two to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
