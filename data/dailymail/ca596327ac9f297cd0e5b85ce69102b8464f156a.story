An alopecia sufferer who lost all the hair on her body has miraculously regrown a full head of hair after taking steroid medication for a chest infection.

Sarah Ford’s hair started falling out in patches when she was 15 as the result of stress.

She hated going to school as she was tormented by bullies - the police even had to be called on two occasions after she was assaulted.

Happy family: Sarah Ford who started losing her hair when she was 15 with her children, Emily, eight and five-year-old Jay. Her hair erturned when she began taking steroid medication for a chest infection

By the age of 20 she was bald and by the age of 22 she had lost all the hair on her body – including her eyelashes and eyebrows.

Mrs Ford, 26, said: ‘I was devastated when it started to go patchy – at that age all you think about is hair and make-up.

‘I felt like I didn’t fit in and I was bullied quite badly at school. Losing my hair didn’t help matters. I made every excuse not to go to school.’

Her confidence plummeted and the mother-of-two spent nearly a decade bald and refused to go out without a scarf tied around her head.

Hair loss – known as alopecia - can affect anyone. Some studies have found that women are more likely to be affected than men and alopecia in all its forms is estimated to affect one in 100 people in the UK - up to 600,000 sufferers.

Mrs Ford began losing great clumps of hair. She could hide it when her hair was patchy but was devastated when it all fell out

Mrs Ford said: ‘I thought it was bad when I started to get patches but at least I could try and hide that. It was awful when I lost it all.

‘People would look at me and think I had cancer. I felt really self-conscious.

‘A woman even stopped me in the street and asked me what type of cancer I had because she’d had cancer. People just assume.’

She married her childhood sweetheart Neil Ford when she was 23 but instead of wearing a tiara with a flowing veil, she had to have a special headdress tailor-made.

The full-time mother went to the doctor in April last year as a chest infection was causing her asthma to flare up.

They prescribed her a short-term high dose of steroids and within weeks her hair follicles were starting to regrow.

Mrs Ford said: ‘I was so excited but I didn’t know if it was going to stay. It looked as if someone had shaved my head when it was starting to come through.

‘I’ve got a full head of hair now. I don’t have to think about how people will react or what scarf I will have to wear – I always tried to match them to my outfits. My confidence is improving.’

Alopecia is usually treated with steroid injections or creams, but it does not work for everyone.

Mrs Ford had not tried any treatments as a specialist had told her they were a ‘waste of time’.

She said: ‘The dermatologist I saw back then was quite ignorant and just told me not to bother.

‘I want people with alopecia to know there is the possibility of your hair growing back even when you have been bald for years and to look into all the options.

‘I feel more confident and am getting used to going out without a scarf on. It had become a kind of security and it was very weird going out without it for the first time, but all my friends and family were very supportive.’

Husband Neil, 31, a construction worker, said: ‘I met my wife when she had alopecia and it’s never bothered me. I’ve always been saying to just go out and not worry.

‘If it makes her happy then it makes me happy. Her confidence has really improved and it’s great to see that.’

Mrs Ford asked her doctor if she could keep taking a low dose of the steroid medication but was told it would not be safe for her health.

If oral steroids are taken for more than three months they can have serious side effects, including weight gain, thinning skin, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and cataracts.
