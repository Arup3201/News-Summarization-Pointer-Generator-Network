You’d be forgiven for thinking console gaming was thriving - following major launches of new consoles from Microsoft and Sony, plus a series of high-profile games.

But some experts are taking a much more sober view.

Although video games spending is expected to grow by 10 per cent this year, only $4 (£2) in every $10 (£6) in the industry is set to come from disc-based games played on consoles and PCs.

The rising popularity of online games, and the increase in mobile gaming, has led to a drop in traditional games as we know them.

Experts predict only $4 (£2) in every $10 (£6) in 2014 will come from console games. Disc-based games will account for just 41% of all video games revenue, down from 68% in 2009, while online games will jump to 31% and mobile will account for 28% of games

Strategy Analytics claim that over the next year, disc-based games will account for just 41 per cent of all video games revenue, down from 68 per cent five years ago.

Online games will make up 31 per cent of revenue - up from 21 per cent in 2009 - while mobile is expected to account for 28 per cent of games sales – two and a half times its 11 per cent share, five years ago.

‘Disc-based games have suffered from the emergence of digital gaming and won’t ever recapture the peak years of the PS2 and Wii generations,’ said Eric Smith, analyst at Strategy Analytics’ Digital Consumer Practice.

Senior Analyst Michael Inouye from ABI Research told MailOnline: ‘In addition, more consumers are downloading games, eschewing the physical copies.

 of revenue - up from 21 per cent in 2009.

While mobile is expected to 
account for 28 per cent of games sales - two and a half times its 11 per
 cent share, five years ago.

Around 28 million consoles were shipped 
globally in 2013, half the volume shipped five years ago.

However 
shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units. This has been helped by the release of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.

Experts predict spending on disc-based 
games to peak again 2016, but further growth depends on more the launch of Android micro-consoles such as Ouya, nVidia’s Shield and 
Huawei’s Tron.

‘Mobile is popular because so many of us have these devices in our possession throughout most of the day, but it’s important to see the delineation between mobile and what many call core gaming.’

And Brian Blau, research director of consumer technology and markets at Gartner added: ‘Console games today are still very expensive when you compare purchase price with mobile games, and gamers are starting to realise they can get value from less expensive content.’

Mobile gaming is popular because the devices are portable and the games are cheap – usually selling for less than £3 ($5), or are free, but funded by in-app purchases.

While mobile games are still relatively small in download size, console titles can be quite large, too.

Due to the recent surge in mobile gaming, the industry is increasingly supporting mobile, and the processors are steadily becoming more powerful, in order to rival consoles.

Blau told MailOnline: ‘Mobile is the fastest growing category in the video game market and because mobile game apps are always with you, there is also a large number of players and also a big engagement with those types of apps.

‘So as part of an overall game market, because of the rise of mobile, you can say that other parts of the market are shrinking.’

‘It’s important to note that the console manufacturers also considered going ‘disc-less’ for this generation but determined the market wasn’t ready yet - so the removal of the disc drive is not necessarily indicative of a decline in the console market but rather a likely inevitable transition down the road,’ Inoyue continued.

‘When you factor in download speeds, data caps, and limited storage space, the timing wasn’t right for disc-less gaming on a wholesale level.

‘It’s also worth noting Sony and Microsoft are helping to explore the opportunities with cloud gaming.'

Smith explained console obituaries are premature for three reasons: ‘Firstly, a large enough gaming enthusiast segment remain devoted to console gaming.

'Secondly, while smartphone and tablets have taken market share they have exposed more people to gaming than ever before - a small but significant proportion of ‘mobile first’ gamers graduate to dedicated handheld or home consoles, sustaining the market.

‘Thirdly, the companies are deeply committed to investing in the perpetuation of the console model. Aside from games, it’s a key [strategy] into the connected living room for Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and perhaps others in future such as Amazon and Apple.’

Console sales to date have been strong for Sony and Microsoft, but weak for Nintendo, the Nintendo Wii U pictured, and this is contributing to overall lower numbers for the 8th generation of consoles

However, shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units.

‘It will take years before the consoles fully transition to digital downloads and that will remove some of the buying friction,’ continued Blau.

‘There is a very loyal console and PC user base, and those types of gamers drive a significant portion of the game market.’

Analyst Eric Smith said: 'Humans have always played games. Given the breadth of innovation set to hit the market over the next few years - whether its the Oculus Rift VR, pictured, or the lively Android-based micro-console scene - there has never been a better time to love playing video games'

Smith claimed there should be enough interest to sustain ‘at least two high-end games consoles for another hardware generation after the current one.’

Experts predict spending on disc-based games to peak in 2016, but further growth depends on more value-oriented plays from Android micro-consoles such as Ouya, nVidia’s Shield and Huawei’s Tron.

‘Humans have always played games, it’s up to the industry to provide the outlets which best match contemporary habits.
