Today France threatened to pull out early from the NATO-led war in Afghanistan after a rogue Afghan soldier opened fire on French soldiers, killing four and wounding about 15 others.            

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said all French operations on the ground were being suspended and his defence minister was dispatched to clarify things on the ground in Afghanistan.  

'If the security conditions are not clearly established then the 
question of an early return of French forces from Afghanistan will 
arise,' said Sarkozy.

Statement: Today France threatened to pull out early from the NATO-led war in Afghanistan after a rogue Afghan soldier opened fire on French soldiers, killing four and wounding about 15 others

'It’s unacceptable that our soldiers are killed by our allies,' Sarkozy said.  

If the security conditions are not clearly established then the 
question of an early return of French forces from Afghanistan will 
arise,' said Sarkozy. 

France has almost 4,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the 130,000-strong NATO-led force there.

French troops mainly patrol Kapisa, an often restive province in 
mountains near Kabul. They are due to leave by around the end of 
2013.     

Cease operations: Mr Sarkozy said it was 'unacceptable' that Afghan troops would attack French soldiers

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news conference about 15 
other soldiers were wounded, eight of them seriously.       

The Taliban said that they could not confirm whether or not the 
killer was a Taliban member but signalled that such attacks were part of
its strategy.

NATO has been rapidly expanding the size of the Afghan security 
forces so that they will be able to take over all responsibility for 
security by the time Western combat forces leave in 2014.            

Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in a statement: 'In regard to the 
killing of four French soldiers in Kapisa, I would like to express my 
deep sadness and condolences to the families of the victims as well as 
to the French people.'       

In an email statement to media, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid 
said: 'There are a number of Afghan soldiers who have an Afghan, Islamic
dignity in their hearts and who have carried out a number of attacks 
against foreign troops.' 

The Taliban 'has skillfully placed the Taliban inside enemy ranks who
have carried out attacks, however it is not clear whether the shooter 
(in Kapisa) belonged to the Islamic Emirate', he said, using another 
name that the Taliban call themselves.             

Jimmie Cummings, spokesman for the NATO-led International Security 
Assistance Force in Kabul, said: 'There is no indication that these 
incidents are linked or part of any larger coordinated effort.'     

More than 2,500 foreign troops have died in Afghanistan since the NATO-led war began in 2001. The latest killings take the French toll to 82.

The shooting was the latest in a string of attacks by 'rogue' Afghan soldiers and police on their foreign partners, or by insurgents who had infiltrated security forces.   

Dozens of foreign soldiers have been killed in recent years by what NATO dubs the 'insider threat', complicating coalition efforts to train Afghanistan’s army and police force.               

Two French Foreign Legion soldiers and one American were killed in separate episodes of so-called “green-on-blue” shootings last month, which refer to the colours of the Afghan army and the symbol of NATO.

The coalition no longer releases the number of its troops killed by Afghan soldiers.   

French Defence Minister Gerard Longuet said he would report back to Sarkozy by next Tuesday after his trip to Afghanistan.  

Late Thurday six U.S. marines were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, American officials said today.

The crash in Helmand Province is the worst since last August when 30 soldiers, including elite U.S. Navy Seals, were killed.

The cause of the accident is unknown - although there was no enemy activity area at the time of the crash.

The Nato helicopter involved was believed to be a Marine CH-53 Sea Stallion.

The crash happened hours after seven civilians were killed in a suicide bombing outside Kandahar Air Field - a base for U.S. and Nato operations.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said they were targeting a Nato convoy.

Two witnesses said they suspected the suicide car bomber was trying to hit U.S. forces because he detonated his explosives just as two pick-up trucks, which they say are often used by American special forces, were leaving the base.

Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef said Nato forces opened fire after the bombing and that they killed three of the seven civilians who died. The coalition denied this, saying there was no fighting after the blast.

Earlier, officials reported that the suicide bomber was walking near the gate, but the Afghan Ministry of Interior later said the attacker was driving a Toyota Corolla.

Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor, said two children were among the seven civilians killed.

He said eight other civilians, including two children and one woman, were injured in the explosion.
