A 67-year-old serial rapist suspected of committing nearly 100 rapes in his lifetime has been caught in Russia.

Valery Makarenkov prowled the streets and parks of capital Moscow preying on women in a reign of terror that spanned more than 30 years.

Always wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables.

Campaign of fear: Valery Makarenkov prowled the streets and parks of capital Moscow preying on women in a reign of terror that spanned more than 30 years

Cowardly: Always wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables

And his campaign of fear finally came to an end last month when Makarenkov attacked a 29-year-old woman in a park in the city.

His brave victim was able to fight him off and get a good look at his face after pulling off his mask in the tussle that ensued.

After escaping the attack, the woman alerted police nearby who tracked him down and arrested him, after the woman identified his as the face behind the mask.

'Old age finally caught up with him and he was unable to complete the act, as his victim was able to beat him off,' said a police spokesman.

The investigators were able to 
establish the involvement of Makarenkov in numerous crimes, some of them
 through DNA. The most recent victims were also able to identified him.

In
 the years leading to Makarenkov's arrest, detectives studied 
handwriting they had of the suspect and compiled a list of around 20,000
 Moscow residents who bore resemblence to the suspect's description.

Police say Makarenkov didn't targeted women who would be easy to subdue, acting spontaneously

'After several years of hard analytical work, Valery Makarenkov, who was born in 1947, was detained,' Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia's Investigative Committee, said. 'According to investigators, in the period from 1987 to 2014, he carried out a series of attacks on women in Moscow that were associated with robberies.'

Investigators say many of the attacks followed a specific 'modus operandi' in which Makarenkov would pose as an ordinary cyclist late at night or early in the morning.

He would follow his victims in Moscow parks or in the backyards of apartment buildings, where he would choke the women unconscious and rape them before stealing any valuable possessions they were carrying.

'Thanks to the modern high-tech equipment of the Russian Investigative Committee's Main Criminalistics Department, a rapid molecular-genetic study of the suspect's DNA samples allowed investigators to quickly establish his involvement in 19 crimes,' Markin explained. 'The young woman who was attacked three days earlier confidently identified the suspect.'
