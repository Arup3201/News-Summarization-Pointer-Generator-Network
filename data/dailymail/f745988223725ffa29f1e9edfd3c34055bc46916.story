Lenny Henry received mixed reviews when he guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today Programme

Comedian Lenny Henry has said work has 'simply dried up' for black, Asian and minority ethnic actors  in the UK.

He said that 'colour-blind casting' has not caught on in the UK and the likes of Idris Elba, who has been touted as the next James Bond and actress Thandie Newton are not getting the job offers they should.  

Henry made the comments after he guest-edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme, when the on-air line-up was altered to ensure every member of the team was from black or ethnic minority background. 

The comedian told The Guardian: 'Whereas I have only dipped my toe into news, I know much more about another part of the creative industries - acting.

'And here in the UK, work has simply dried up for Bame actors. 

'People such as David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Cush Jumbo aren't getting the offers one might expect. 

'Colour-blind casting hasn't quite caught on in the UK, so jobs in high-end drama are dribbling away."

In yesterday's programme, regular presenter Mishal Husain was joined by Nkem Ifejika, with Reeta Chakrabarti reading the news, and Jay Wynne presenting the weather.

Linda Yueh was handling the business news while Karthi Gnanasegaram presented the sport.

Henry challenged Culture Secretary Sajid Javid on whether the next BBC charter should include minimum targets for diversity among staff and on-screen talent, but agreed with the Cabinet minister that simple quotas would be ineffective.

While some people supported the programme calling it 'refreshing' others criticised it for not being diverse enough.

Broadcaster Jeremy Vine was quick to come out in support of the show calling it 'thought-provoking.'

Bethany Skinnard tweeted: 'Really enjoyed your guest edit@LennyHenry on @BBCRadio4 #todayshow really refreshing perspective and let's not forget # devilsavocado'

However, others described the decision to exclude white presenters as 'positive race discrimination' and described Henry as a 'hypocrite.'

Steve Speck tweeted: 'R4 Today Prog - prime example of positive race discrimination. Lenny Henry insisted all presenters from ethnic minorities. #bbcr4today' 

During the show Henry revealed that he had been the victim of racism his 'whole life.' 

He said that included during the programme and  after he made earlier in the year to BAFTA about the lack of black and ethnic minority people on screen.

'I'm very aware there's still a way to go,' he said.

'But what's great is there's a tolerance in this country that is extraordinary and to be proud of and I'm proud to be British and my mum was proud to be British too.'
