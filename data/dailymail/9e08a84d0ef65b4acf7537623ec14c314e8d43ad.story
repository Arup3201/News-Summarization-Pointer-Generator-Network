Shrien Dewani, pictured at his trial, 'threw a pizza party for 500 people days after ordering the hit on his new wife, Anni', her family claim 

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani threw a pizza party for 500 people days after allegedly masterminding a hit on his new wife, her family allege.

The millionaire businessman was also so controlling during his engagement to Anni Dewani that she described him as behaving 'like Hitler', her‎ father Vinod Hindocha has claimed.

Mr Hindocha said he was upset by the party - which took place six days after her murder in 2010 - because it was not in keeping with the family's Hindu religion. 

He said: 'I was offended by this as it is customary that no parties are held during the period of mourning yet Dewani did this stating that Anni loved pizza and chips and the pizza party was a memorial service to her.

'All the elder people - not just we relatives - were disappointed and questioned that such a party had been planned.'

Dewani is accused of organising the murder of his wife in a staged carjacking as they drove through a Cape Town township.

Mr Hindocha told police how his Swedish daughter often fought with Dewani during their courtship.

After one row she told him 'not to regard her as a possession and threatened to leave him and return to Sweden,' he said.

'She also stated, "Pappa, he is like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get married."'

On one occasion she was so upset by Dewani she announced she would 'manage her own life' after their wedding, he said.

‎Mr Hindocha also told how 'arrogant' Dewani upset the family after his daughter's death and allegedly 'manhandled' her body.

He said Dewani insisted on helping his elder daughter Ami, 37 and her cousin Sneha, 31, prepare the Swedish engineering graduate for her funeral.

He added: 'It serves to mention that this is out of the ordinary in the Hindu custom as only females are tasked with this when a female dies. 

'After their return from the funeral parlour both Ami and Sneha came to report to me that some strange thing had happened at the parlour.

'Ami stated that Dewani had attempted to place some gold bangles onto Anni's wrist and when he experienced trouble doing this, tried to force then on and then asked for some soap, hoping this would solve the problem.

'Ami had then stopped him as she as of the opinion that he was manhandling Anni's body. She also thought him to be insensitive, as he rushed them along, stating that had to leave the funeral parlour.'

Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, said he was upset by the party which he claims took place six days after his daughter's death in November 2010

Dewani also refused to allow his wife's mother and other family members to spend just 30 minutes with the body to pay their last respects privately, saying there was not enough time, Mr Hindocha claimed.

The next morning he said the care home tycoon stormed into the funeral parlour and forbade the Hindochas, who were gathered around Anni, from putting roses in her coffin.

Mr Hindocha added: 'l was the first person to walk up to the coffin to do so but when I tried to, Dewani refused, stating "I don't want this coffin to look like a dustbin".

'He also gave me a look I can only describe as vicious.

'The roses were placed in a corner. After the ceremony Preyen intervened and handed the roses to Dewani to place in the coffin.'

Dewani threatened to call off Anni's memorial service if any of the Hindochas attended, claiming to have been upset by his father-in-law, it was claimed.

‎Mr Hindocha also told how as suspicions grew over Dewani in the days after the murder, the businessman's brother Preyen took him to to a meeting with the the now disgraced PR guru Max Clifford.

He said: 'Preyen asked me to accompany him to a man called Max Clifford where he wanted me to make a statement denying that there was any animosity between the two families… he also wanted me to sign a document stating this but I declined.'

‎Mr Hindocha made his claims in a statement given to police which formed part of the case against Xolile Mngeni who was earlier convicted of shooting Anni.

Mngeni died in jail on Saturday from cancer.

Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, denies murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.
