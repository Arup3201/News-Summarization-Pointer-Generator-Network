A nine-year-old boy was stalked down the street on his way to school, grabbed, then stabbed in the neck.

Jermaine Colver, from Staten Island, New York, was walking down a snow-covered street when an unidentified man crept up behind him and lashed out with a bladed weapon.

He was jumped by the man at 7.55am Friday as he walked to school through the Mariners Harbor neighborhood.

Surveillance footage captured the attack, which shows the man approaching from behind, grabbing the small boy and swinging his arm in a stabbing motion three times around his head and upper body.

The fifth-grader stumbles to the ground then flees. The attacker does not appear to follow him.

According to the New York Post, Jermaine described his attacker to police as an old man, and said he was wearing a blue hoodie. 

Despite the apparent viciousness of the attack, Jermaine was reportedly not badly wounded. 

The New York Daily News reported that Jermaine ran home and told his older brothers about the attack, who called 911 and went looking for the attacker.

Jermaine was eventually taken to Richmond University Medical Center on Staten Island. He was said to have non life-threatening wounds, including a graze to the shoulder.

His family hopes that he will be able to come home tomorrow.
