Over the years his property portfolio has grown every bit as impressively as  his fortune. But Tony Blair has not always enjoyed success with the buying and selling of his many homes.

Until now, for I learn that he and his wife Cherie have scooped £170,000 on a recent sale.

The bonanza profit — more than the UK average price for a whole house — was made in just four years on a home in Marylebone they bought for their son Nicky in 2009.

Bonanza profit: Tony Blair and his wife Cherie made £170,00 on the sale of a house they owned for just four years

They paid £1.13 million to purchase the four-bedroom Georgian townhouse for cash, and have sold it for £1.3 million to a former Pakistani politician and would-be Tory MP.

The new owner, Dr Ashraf Chohan, who has British and Pakistani citizenship, says he was selected by the Conservatives as a potential parliamentary candidate. Instead, he stood for election in Pakistan.

Dr Chohan, 59, already owned the house next door to Nicky, from where he runs a medical clinic. He says Cherie had initially tried to buy his house from him.

‘I bought my house in 2009, the same time as the Blairs,’ he says. ‘Mrs Blair contacted me and asked if we wanted to sell our house. I think she wanted it for her daughter. But I did not want to sell.

‘Then, a few years later, I made an offer to the Blairs they found difficult to turn down, and we bought their house.’

Dr Chohan says being a neighbour of Nicky had been an eye-opening experience for him. ‘It has been shocking to see children of Tony Blair doing their own shopping at Tesco, and cycling around like ordinary children. We would never see children of ministers in Pakistan mixing with anyone other than their own class.’

He adds: ‘The Blairs have been very good neighbours, always courteous. The Blair children were very down to earth, very polite.’

Nicky, 27, moved out last month to a larger property nearby, which the Blairs bought for him for £1.35 million in cash.

The Blairs still maintain a portfolio of eight properties worth an estimated £21 million. Their two other elder children, Euan, 29, and Kathryn, 25, also have their own houses.

Earlier this year, the Blairs bought a woodland retreat for the former PM’s sister Sarah close to their Buckinghamshire mansion, which they paid £5.75 million for in 2008.

'I can't believe I'm still working': Anita Harris, 72

Once the highest paid cabaret artist in the world, Anita Harris lost everything in a Swiss banking fraud — but now at the age of 72 she has become a workaholic as she battles to regain fame and fortune.

‘I can’t believe I’m still working, but now I’ve got two jobs,’ Anita reveals at the opening night of Wag! The Musical, at the Charing Cross Theatre.

‘I’m touring the country in  A Murder Has Been Arranged and also rehearsing for my new one-woman show,’ she adds. ‘It’s tough going at my age — I had thought I might be retired by now.’

A former Carry On star, convent-educated Anita has been married to artist Mike Margolis for almost 40 years. In 1985, they lost millions after, she claims, a bank embezzled their savings.

Her woes were compounded by the loss of their £1 million Barnes home and personal tragedy — both she and Mike have suffered cancer.

‘But being a workaholic is saving me,’ beams Anita. ‘I look on the bright side.’

In 2008, Paul Stewart was snowboarding in the French Alps when an avalanche swept him over the side of a mountain, dumping him on his back 200ft below. He was paralysed from the waist down and told, at the age of 27, he would never walk again.

But Paul has astonished doctors and now gets around, largely under his own steam, on sticks and with leg braces. And next month he will take on a remarkable physical challenge.

Over two weeks Paul, son of stockbroker and racing figure Andy Stewart, will swim two-and-a-half miles, cycle 112 miles, walk 26 miles and then, uniquely, climb the face of the very cliff from which he fell.

It is called the Iron Spine Challenge and has inspired a host of celebrity figures from David Cameron to Sir Alex Ferguson to back him. Paul, a member of England’s wheelchair tennis team, tells me: ‘I want to do a challenge for charity and going back to the scene of my accident seems very appropriate.’

He hopes to raise £350,000 for Spinal Research and Wings For Life.

Childhood sweetheart: Daisy Fellowes could be heading for a marriage proposal from gentleman farmer and longtime beau Frederick Brun

Prince Harry and girlfriend Cressida Bonas are not the only couple going from strength to strength — one of Cressie’s pals Daisy Fellowes could be heading for a marriage proposal.

‘Don’t tell her yet but my secret plan is to ask Daisy to marry me under the Northern Lights,’ Daisy’s beau, handsome gentleman farmer Frederick Brun, 25, tells me.

The couple are childhood sweethearts, but Tudor Hall-educated Daisy, also 25, who  runs her Lilah design company making elegant silk jackets for clients including Pippa Middleton, prefers to keep a low profile.

This weekend, they are heading to the posh Secret Garden music festival, which is held in the grounds of her father landowner Lord de Ramsey’s 6,000-acre estate, where he lives with second wife Alison at Abbots Ripton Hall near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire. Old Harrovian Freddie is from the neighbouring Norfolk, where he lives at stately Fring Hall.

‘We’ve known each other for ever and have a lot in common like countryside conservation and preservation, although I don’t begin to understand fashion,’ says Freddie, who runs a green fuel company.  

‘I’ve been looking at original ways to propose and want to do something more adventurous like take a trip up to the Arctic Circle.’

█ Andy Murray’s triumph at Wimbledon has had an unexpected spin-off — equality for women.

Councillors in Merton have decided to give Murray the Honorary Freedom of the London borough where the championships are held, but realised, to their horror, that they hadn’t done the same for three other Britons who have won the singles — all of them women.

So, after quite a wait, the Freedom Of Merton is also being granted  to Angela Mortimer Barrett (who won  in 1961), Ann Haydon-Jones (1969), and Virginia Wade (1977).

Better late than never.

PS The excitement of the royal baby has not escaped Prince Charles’s goddaughter India Hicks in the Bahamas.

She is thrilled that William and Kate chose Louis, her grandfather Earl Mountbatten’s name. ‘I was in boarding school when William was born and so only vaguely aware that one of his names was in memory of my grandfather, who mentored Prince Charles and kept a protective arm around him through his tricky teenage years,’ she says.

Another of her cousins, Nicholas Knatchbull, was asked by Charles to keep an eye on William at Eton.  It was not a success. Nicholas has had a troubled life fighting crack cocaine and heroin addiction.
