A distraught mother has made an international appeal for the return of her five-year-old daughter who was snatched in Egypt.

Naomi Button, 39, has not seen Elsa since she was abducted by her father during a holiday over a year ago.

Her estranged Egyptian husband Tamer Salama, 35, is in prison in Britain for refusing to say where he has hidden the little girl.

Appeal: Naomi Button is desperate to see her daughter Elsa who was abducted in Egypt in 2011

Split: Elsa was taken by her father, Tamer Salama, after the breakdown of his marriage to Ms Button

Miss Button, a banking consultant, suspects she is living in Egypt with members of Salama’s family.

High Court judges allowed her to speak
about the case for the first time yesterday to appeal for information 
on her daughter’s whereabouts.

‘I can’t describe what life been like 
since she was taken,’ Miss Button said. ‘The worst times are when I wake
up in the middle of the night. I worry that she’s crying for me, I 
wonder that she thinks I just left her. I don’t know what she’s been 
told. I don’t know if she thinks I don’t want her and I just left her in
Egypt.

‘The one thing I knew when I got on 
that plane [home from Egypt] without her is no matter what it took, no 
matter how long it took, I would find Elsa and she would find her life 
as it was. She found it very difficult being away from me for any length
of time. I know that she wants to be back home with mummy and I hope 
that they do the right thing.’

Desperate: Ms Button has travelled to Egypt several times to try and find her daughter with no success

Elsa disappeared on December 27, 2011,
after her parents, who had separated, took her on holiday to Sharm 
el-Sheikh to visit Salama’s family. Salama sneaked her out of their 
apartment and texted Miss Button to demand she sign a contract giving up
all parental responsibilities.

Miss Button went to the British 
Embassy and the local police for help but was forced to return to the UK
to get legal advice. Meanwhile, Salama also returned to England, where 
he had been training in Southampton to be a teacher.

He was detained by police and in 
January last year was jailed for contempt of court as he refused to 
reveal where he is hiding his daughter. Last week, his continued silence
saw him sentenced to a further 12 months in prison.

Miss Button has been back to Egypt 
four times to look for Elsa, who will celebrate her sixth birthday next 
Saturday. She has kept her daughter’s bedroom as she left it, with her 
unopened Christmas presents still by the fireplace.

‘To snatch Elsa away from me was the 
cruellest thing anyone could do,’ she said. ‘For me, the difficulty is 
the emptiness of the house... waking up in the morning and expecting to 
hear her.’

Miss Button, a consultant at Yorkshire
Building Society, met Salama when he was working at an international 
school in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005. The couple married in Egypt in 2006 
and moved to England in 2007 following Elsa’s birth.

They separated in 2009 but continued 
to live together in the family home in Leeds for Elsa’s sake until 
Salama began a teacher training degree in August 2010.

Miss Button agreed in 2011 to go on holiday with him to Egypt so Elsa could see her grandparents.

While they were there, she asked him 
to consider a divorce and admitted she had struck up a relationship with
an ex-boyfriend. Furious, Salama tried to make her give up Elsa by 
accusing her of adultery – a criminal offence in Egypt.

Miss Button has been prevented from 
talking about the case until now because Elsa was made a ward of court, 
meaning her identity could not be revealed.

Kate Banerjee of Jones Myers LLP, the 
lawyers acting for Miss Button, said: ‘Elsa is without the love and care
of either a mother or father in a country where she doesn’t speak the 
language or understand the culture. We appeal to anyone who knows Elsa’s
whereabouts to just pick up the phone and help us return this little 
girl to her mother.’
