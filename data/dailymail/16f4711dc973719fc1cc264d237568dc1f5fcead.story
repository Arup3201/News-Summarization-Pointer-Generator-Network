An elderly farmer who had his ribcage shattered by a two-tonne bull has made an amazing recovery thanks to pioneering ‘Meccano’ surgery.

Lawrence Haygarth, 70, was left breathless and in agony after his prized Belgian Blue repeatedly charged into his chest and pummelled him on the ground on a hillside at Kelleth Rigg, near Tebay, Cumbria.

The grandfather sustained life-threatening injuries including 11 broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, a punctured lung, torn ligaments and a dislocated sternum.

He only survived because his nine-year-old grandson Alfie saw the attack and ran half a mile to find help.

Mr Haygarth only survived because his grandson, Alfie Green (pictured with dogs, Flo and Spud) ran half a mile to find help

As a result of the attack, which took place in October 2011, he was forced to retire and sell his prize herd.

However, after pioneering surgery to rebuild his ribcage using plates and screws at the Blackpool Victoria Hospital, he is now able to breathe properly again.

The new technique sees tailor made surgical plates pinned to the broken bones to alleviate pain and speed up recovery.

It can allow patients to escape complications such as pneumonia, breathing difficulties and chest deformity and has a recovery time of just a few days.

Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed.

This
 could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such 
as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity.

Mr Haygarth had been bringing his herd in for winter when the Belgian Blue bull attacked him.

During the attack Mr Haygarth sustained 11 broken ribs

He said: ‘He crushed my chest; I could feel my bones breaking. He tossed me about ten feet in the air.

‘Eventually he threw me behind a stone wall, I thought I was dying.’

Fortunately,
 his nine-year-old grandson Alfie Green saw the attack and raised the 
alarm. But the bull refused to move until the downdraft from the air 
ambulance's rotors forced it away.

Alfie ran half a mile back to the family farmhouse and flagged down part-time farm worker Andrew Clark, who called for help.

‘My granddad called me to stay with him but I knew he needed help so I ran as fast as I could,’ said Alfie.

Mr
 Lawrence was airlifted to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary where his 
injuries prompted a transfer to the cardiac care and intensive care unit
 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

Surgeons said he was extremely lucky to have survived the attack.

‘My lungs were filling up fast with fluid and I could hardly breathe,’ said Mr Haygarth. ‘They just got to me in time.’

Mr Haygarth has nothing but praise for the cardiothoracic surgeon who operated on him.

‘The
 procedure Mr Nidal Bittar carried out on me was grand. I'm getting a 
lot better and it has improved the quality of my life,’ he said.

‘I still get out of breath at times, but I can do so much more than I could.

‘I can saw wood and hammer in nails, I even built a shed recently and can take walks again in the fells.’

He added: ‘I retired after the accident because I couldn't carry on with the work and sold all the cattle

‘I
 had planned to carry on farming for a little longer, but it wasn't 
possible after the attack, but now I feel quite well and I could start 
again - but I don't think my wife would let me!’

Following the surgery the 'Meccano' plates and screws are visible on an X-ray of Mr Haygarth's chest

His surgeon, Mr Bittar, said that 
pain would have been 'part and parcel' of Mr Haygarth's life without the
 surgery, flaring up every time he moved.

However, after the surgery, which 'screwed' the ribs back into place, he felt the pain relief almost immediately.

Mr
 Bittar said: ‘If the ribs are unstable the patient cannot breathe 
properly. The fixator, called a Synthes Rib Matrix, guarantees 
stability. It allows the patient to breathe and reduces the pain level.’

Likening the procedure to a 
'Meccano' set, he added: ‘We now have the technology to stabilise 
fractures, pulling the ribs back into place using plates which are 
attached to the bone with screws.’

Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed.

This
 could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such 
as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity.

The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately.

During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain.

Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs.

The recovery time from the operation is only a few days.

The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.
