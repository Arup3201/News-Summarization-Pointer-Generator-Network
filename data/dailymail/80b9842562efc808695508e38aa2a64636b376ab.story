A determined Christian evangelist has demonstrated his devotion to his faith by carrying a huge cross for thousands of miles across the globe for the past 26 years.

Lindsay Hamon, 60, has trekked through 19 countries including India, New Zealand, Romania and Sri Lanka during his remarkable journey.

And despite being thrown out of St Peter's Square, in Rome, being shot at in Bangladesh and attacked by angry zealots, he remains resolute and has no plans to give up on his mission.

Determined: Christian evangelist Lindsay Hamon carries his cross through Wellington, Somerset as he makes his pilgrimage around the world

Trek: Mr Hamon carrying his cross through Romania. He has so far trekked through 19 countries around the world including India, New Zealand, Romania and Sri Lanka

Journey: Mr Hamon poses with his cross in Assam.  He first took up the 12ft 6in tall cross in 1987 and has spent only a handful of days without it

Exotic travels: Among the regions he journeyed through was South East Asia (pictured). His next trip abroad will be to Latvia

Father-of-two Lindsay said: 'There is a reaction from people straight away, you end up talking and connecting to people you wouldn't normally talk to.

'People start opening up about their own lives and you end up sharing with them something that is most personal.

'I find people often want to talk, but if people don't want to know I walk on. The love you get from it all is amazing, people will just stop and ask you questions, offer you food and sometimes a place to stay.

Challenge: He is seen here carrying the cross in Walthamstow, east London during the earlier stages of his journey

Mr Hamon carries the huge cross, which 
has a wheel at its base, over his shoulder for up to 12 
hours a day, and often has no idea where he will sleep that night.

But the part-time care worker, from Camborne, Cornwall, admitted he has sometimes put his life at risk during his travels.

He said: 'There is fear there sometimes because I have a wife and kids and you don't want to put yourself in danger. It is really trusting in God, knowing he will protect you.'

He first took up the 12ft by 6ft tall cedar wood cross in 1987 and has only spent a handful of weeks without it.

Mr Hamon receives generous donations from supporters to help him stay on the road, but he stops to carry out carework in his home town in order to pay his family's bills.

'I tried giving up my full time work and doing this full time instead but I didn't get enough money to make ends meet,' he added.

Mr Hamon has spoken to thousands of curious people during his trek around the world and has shaken hands and prayed with many more.

He often finds himself ministering to prostitutes or invited to brothels, and will regularly spend nights in bus shelters or basic accommodation with only a sleeping bag, and a hole in the floor for a toilet.

Even language barriers do not hold the preacher back and he regularly finds himself mobbed by hundreds of locals wanting to hear him speak.

Beginning: Mr Hamon smiles as he poses in front of his cross at the start of his travels around the world

Courage: He is confronted by police as he tries to carry the cross into Red Square, Moscow

Stamina: Mr Hamon in Lands End, Cornwall. The 60-year-old has needed remarkable mental and physical strength to make his trek

Compassion: He stops to pray with a stranger as he journey's around the world. Mr Hamon has helped many people in need during his travels

He said: 'As you can expect in the UK
 language isn't a problem. I walk into town centres and try and say 
hello to everyone I can but I realise that some people don't want to 
talk.

'You shake hands with people a lot and 
some ask you to pray with them. Oddly some of the best conversations I 
have had have been at pubs where people are willing to sit down and give
 the time to talk to you.

Achievement: Mr Hamon carries his cross next to St Peter's Square, Rome - the headquarters of the Catholic Church

'I can speak a bit of Spanish and French but other than that it can be a bit of a problem.

He said that when he visits countries where he cannot speak the language he tries to write out a prayer in that language to show people. 'Often I will just pray in English anyway,' he said.

'Sometimes you get people who translate for you, I had one young boy who came out of nowhere when I was talking to around 20 or 30 people and he just translated everything.

'When it was done he just disappeared, I never knew who he was or where he came from, it's amazing.'

He is currently on the road in England, travelling from Taunton, in Somerset, to Bristol, before heading south to Exeter and finally onwards to see his wife and dog at home in Cornwall.

His next trip abroad will be to Latvia in May, before he moves on to Cambodia after the rainy season has ended.

Lindsay has so far walked through; Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Sri Lanka and the UK.
