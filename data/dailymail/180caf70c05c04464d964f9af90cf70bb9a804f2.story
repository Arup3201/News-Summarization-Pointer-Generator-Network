The fastest way to update your look for New Year’s Eve is with a slick of lipstick — and vibrant colours are in fashion right now. They’ve been all over the catwalks and sales are at an all-time high, doubling in the past month. But there is a fine line between alluring vamp and tragedy queen. So to save you from picking the wrong shade, Kate Battersby tried five of the best-selling lip colours to see which work best for a middle-aged woman...

BERRY DELICIOUS 

MAC Satin Lipstick in Rebel, £15.50, maccosmetics.co.uk

You know where you are with MAC — as a brand it isn’t dirt cheap, but the quality always backs up the price. Berry has been named ‘the new red’ by a glossy fashion magazine, so this shade could not be more on-trend.

The colour looked frighteningly dark on the stick, but the berry shade that emerged when on my lips was a wonderfully flattering tone. I’m not certain, however, that it’s splashy enough for New Year.

BROWN AND OUT

Topshop Lips, Boardroom, £8, Topshop

Beauty bloggers rate this colour as the pick of the season. Well, they’re welcome to this one. The dark brown shade made my lips look like a giant blood blister. I’d sum it up as hideous, but it was less attractive than that.

Not even a bit sexy. I wouldn’t go near this. And the quality isn’t great either: the pigment is blotchy.

TANGERINE DREAM  

Body Shop Colour Crush in Coral Cutie, £10, Body Shop

No doubt about it, this is an out-and-out orange. Not even a burnt orange or autumnal shade, but a vibrant, summer orange — and that’s the problem.

Even though I loved the colour in its casing, this is a holiday shade and goes best with a deep tan. It doesn’t feel a natural choice for the party season.

Like every stronger colour, this one needs a lipliner or the colour will bleed.

It has a lovely velvety texture, but it’s not for this time of year.

THE NEW NUDE 

Bourjois Rouge Edition in Beige Trench, £7.99, Superdrug

Everyone remembers the cakey nude lipsticks of the Eighties, but today’s promise a much more subtle effect.

Examining this before application, it seemed distinctly mauve, but on the lips it came out on the blush side of nude, a pretty shade a touch stronger than natural. I approve. You’ll need a blusher with this lipstick to lift the colour.

4/5

SHOCKING PINK

Revlon Super Lustrous, Fuchsia Shock, £3.99, Boots

Never in a million years would I go near this kind of shocking pink. To my mind, there is a reason that the price is so low — this shade screams ‘cheap’, particularly for those of us not in the first bloom of youth.

But it doesn’t form a block of colour. It’s translucent, like a tinted lip shine, which is surprisingly flattering.

It’s better applied with a lip brush, as the wand which comes with it isn’t too precise. However, within ten minutes the colour was fading and needed topping up.
