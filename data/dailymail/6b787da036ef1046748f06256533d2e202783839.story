When it opened its timber doors three years ago, this  £7million ‘eco primary school’ was applauded for its environmentally friendly credentials.

It was heated by solar power and its plumbing system relied on rain collected from the roof, which was made of locally grown sweet chestnut.

Sadly, the zero-carbon building is not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped.

'One of the greenest schools in Britain': Dartington Primary School's eco-building, near Totnes in Devon, needs 'significant' repairs just three years after opening because it has been leaking water

In fact, thanks to a series of water 
leaks and mouldy walls, pupils are now being taught in tents erected in 
the school grounds.

The 
local authority in Devon has already spent £250,000 to investigate the 
problem, and plans to sue the architects. Without urgent repairs, it 
says teaching pupils inside the building could seriously damage their 
health.

Dartington Primary 
School, near Totnes, used to house students in a Victorian building but 
it reopened in 2010 as one of the first zero-carbon schools in the 
country.

The new site was 
praised for being ‘stunning’ and ‘extremely environmentally friendly’. 
Its design featured four buildings made from ‘sustainable’ timber, with 
solar panels providing electricity and heat.

The roof was supposedly 
weather-proofed with strips of sweet chestnut grown nearby and angled so
rainwater could be collected and used to flush the toilets.

But
apparent faults in the structure mean the roof and walls have become 
sodden, buckling over time and leaving gaping holes for rain to leak 
inside.

Costly: The school's 320 pupils will be taught in temporary buildings which will be set up in the playing fields

Tania Mountney, whose son attends the school, said: ‘There’s 
been leaking there ever since it opened. Last year we could see the roof
was starting to warp.’

She
added: I went to a parents’ lunch and you could see these large patches
of mould. My ex-partner is a builder and he couldn’t understand how it 
could get that bad.’

Children
are now being taught in five large marquees in the grounds, with 
repairs to the main buildings predicted to take up to two years.

Miss
Mountney, a childminder, said she only found out about the tents when 
she took her son to school for the beginning of term this week.

‘I drove
past on Sunday and saw several marquees. I thought there must have been
some sort of event on. The next morning I arrived to find classes had 
moved, some of them into marquees and some of them into the library and 
the art room.

'The children are too young to know what’s happening. They 
think it’s all very exciting.’

Legal case: Devon County Council said it might sue the architects of the £7m Dartington Primary School

When
the eco school opened three years ago, headteacher Jill Mahon said: ‘It
is a stunning design. I believe it will be a flagship school which will
be extremely environmentally friendly.’ She declined to comment 
yesterday.

A report for 
Devon County Council found it has already paid £250,000 merely to 
investigate the cause of the leaks and start initial repairs.

A 
spokesman said: ‘Temporary accommodation has been installed and all 
classes went ahead when children returned to school. We are currently 
taking legal advice.’

Architects White Design, of Bristol, said they were working with the council to solve the problems.
