The man is now in a comfortable condition after being taken to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough following the incident, which happened near Redmire in the Yorkshire Dales.

Police believe he was returning home after a night out, when at around 3.20 am on Sunday March 9, he fell from the back of a truck at Sissy Bank Barn in Redmire.

The 29-year-old driver of the truck the man was travelling in when he fell out was later arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.

Cast and crew began filming at Bolton Castle last month and are living in caravans beside the visitor attraction, as well as local pubs and holiday cottages.

Traffic Constable Martin Usher, from the force's roads policing group, said: 'If you were using the Leyburn to Redmire road in the early hours of Sunday 9 March 2014, I ask you to contact the police if you saw the Iveco truck or a man walking along the road.'

The film is being produced by Cowboy Films and Punk Cinema for BBC Films.
