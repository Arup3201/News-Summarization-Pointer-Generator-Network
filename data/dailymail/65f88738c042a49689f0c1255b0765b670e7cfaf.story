Julio Cesar said he had completed an amazing journey from World Cup villain to hero with the two brilliant penalty shoot-out saves that help Brazil secure a spot in the quarter-finals.

In incredible scenes at the Estadio Mineirao the QPR goalkeeper currently on loan at Toronto actually broke down in tears before the shoot-out had even started.

But he remained composed enough to produce a heroic display and afterwards collected  the man of the match award.

He referred immediately to his costly error in the quarter-final against Holland in 2010.

‘After what happened in 2010 I see how many people are just cheering for me and hoping for me after what happened,’ he said.

‘After the World Cup to be labelled as the villain, it was very bad. I got the support of my family, who just supported me.

But his allows me have the necessary strength to go forward. I apologise if I talk too much. I am trying to sum up four years work here.’

Asked about his tears before the penalties, he said: ‘People were saying nice things to me beforehand, beautiful things, and I became very emotional. I just hope I can now celebrate with the people of Brazil by kissing the World Cup.

‘But this was very special after what happened after the last World Cup. I’d like to dedicate this to my mum and dad, the staff and 200 million Brazilians.

‘I believe the Brazilian people just needed this. We all needed this. We all knew it was going to be a very tough game. Chile deserve all our respect.

‘I just hope the games that come now aren’t decided by penalties otherwise our friends and families might have heart attacks.’

Luiz Felipe Scolari echoed the sentiment.

‘It has been very emotional,’ said Brazil’s coach. ‘We could have gone out today at 118 minutes when that ball hit the bar.’

Scolari said Chile’s bench turned it into ‘a war’ on the touchline.

‘We just spoke about this in the dressing room – we are being very cordial to foreign teams,’ he said.

‘It’s about time we started to defend ourselves against the stones being thrown at us. I might need to go back to my old style; I don’t know if you know my old style but it’s very aggressive. The other team, the way they were going to the officials and coming into our area, it was like a war.

‘We just shook hands at the end. It was very cordial and polite. That may need to change because it’s not easy playing in the World Cup at home. The pressure of victory. The people embraced the idea of being champions and now they are demanding it. We promised we would and if you make a promise you must deliver.

‘There is anxiety on our side but we must overcome the difficulties. That is the fourth step and we have three more to reach heaven.’

Scolari said Neymar played on with a thigh injury after a heavy challenge early in the game but hopes he will be fit to play in the quarter-finals.

On Howard Webb’s decision to disallow Hulk’s goal, he suggested ‘things are starting to get weird here’.
