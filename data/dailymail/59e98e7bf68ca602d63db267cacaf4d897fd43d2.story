A message in a bottle has been found more than 3,000 miles away - 42 years after it was thrown from a fishing boat into the North Sea.

Scottish fisherman John Souter, 66, flung the old Hay's lemonade bottle into the North Sea in 1973, and it was discovered by a German tourist on a beach during a trip to the coast of New York.

The visitor, Michael Scholz, took the bottle and its note back to his home in Cologne - before posting it to 66-year-old Mr Souter’s former address in Lossiemouth, Moray.

In total, the bottle has now travelled at least 8,000 miles - from Scotland to the US, then to Germany and finally back to Scotland - since it was tossed into the sea on June 7, 1973.

Mr Souter wrote the message while sailing with his father and late brother-in-law, Bill Stewart. It was on a torn-out page from a previous year's fishing almanac. 

He said: ‘I remember doing it. I was aboard my father's fishing boat. I tore a bit of paper out of an old fishing almanac on board and wrote my name, address and the date on it, before putting it inside an old Hay's lemonade bottle and throwing it into the sea.

‘Bill did the same thing. He heard from someone who found his note within a year, but I'd completely forgotten about mine. It's amazing to think how far it travelled.'

Across the Atlantic Ocean: The bottle drifted 3,300 miles from the North Sea to Jones Beach in New York

The bottle drifted around 3,300 miles to Jones Beach in Nassau County, New York, before it was found by Mr Scholz. He then took it 3,760 miles home with him to Cologne, in Germany, before posting it 960 miles back to Lossiemouth.

Along with the returned note, Mr Scholz wrote a letter saying: ‘I have found your message in a bottle. But I didn't find your message in Germany. Recently I visited New York.

‘During a trip to the coast about 30 miles from John F. Kennedy Airport, I found your message. More than 40 years was your bottle on the go. Wow. It's a long time. This is fantastic. I'm very impressed.’

Mr Souter, who worked as a fisherman for more than 30 years, said he and his wife Eileen sent Mr Scholz a Christmas card to thank him - and they plan to get in touch with him in the coming weeks.
