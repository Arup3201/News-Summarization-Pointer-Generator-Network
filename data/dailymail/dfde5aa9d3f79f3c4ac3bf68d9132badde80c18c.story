Patrick Schwarzenegger is seen here for the first time since pictures emerged of him this weekend partying with a bevy of bikini-clad girls.

The 21-year-old model and boyfriend of Miley Cyrus looked somewhat downcast as he stepped out in Malibu on Thursday.

On Monday Patrick insisted that a girl he was caught cuddling on Sunday was just his best friend's pal - but on Friday more snaps emerged, this time showing him getting close to an ex girlfriend. 

In the snaps, which have been published on TMZ, bikini-clad Taylor Burns is seen rubbing sunscreen into a shirtless Patrick.

Down in the dumps: Miley Cyrus' boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger, pictured on Thursday in Malibu, is seen for the first time since snaps emerged of him partying with bikini-clad girls in Mexico over the weekend

Miley has remained silent on the entire matter, but on Thursday night was partying up a storm in Texas and performing onstage while self-admittedly 'high'  with Mike Will Made It at the SXSW Music Festival .

Interestingly Miley, 22, and the music producer were previously rumoured to be romantically linked last summer, before she started dating Patrick, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.

An clearly inebriated Miley told the crowd last night: 'This is Texas. I don’t know how f***ing high you are, but we’re high as f**k up here.' 

While the Wrecking Ball singer has put on a strong front, she is said to be 'super bummed' about the pictures of Patrick getting close with a his female friend, according to People.com.

Two can play at that game: Miley, meanwhile, made a surprise appearance at the SXSW Music Festival in Texas on Thursday night alongside producer Mike Will Made It, who she was romantically linked to last year 

The show goes on: The singer put on a surprise performance with the music producer and Patrick was noticeably absent

When it comes to style, Miley Cyrus doesn't tend to blend into the background.

But by her standards, this camouflage combo is relatively tame! For her surprise appearance on stage at the South by Southwest festival, she teamed a sequin embellished slip dress with a matching denim jacket, a pair of metallic platform heels and a chunky Chanel choker.

Nobody does sequins quite like Ashish, and Miley's military-inspired matchy matchy look is of course by the brand. Lily Allen, Lindsay Lohan and Jessie J are all fans of the label, who recently even put the sequinned faces of Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and One Direction on their pieces.

Miley's simple little lace trim slip dress hails from the Fall 2015 line, so isn't yet available to buy, but click (right) to Luisa Via Roma to shop the current collection.

Shaking it: Before her performance Miley shared a video of herself twerking in her hotel room

Miley shared snaps of her onstage antics from last night on Instagram, including another picture of herself sat in the backseat of a car with Mike.

She also uploaded a video of herself twerking in her hotel room and laughing, while appearing to be holding a joint in her hand.

Meanwhile, her dedicated fans have been supporting her on social media, however some have taken things too far and made death threats against Patrick.

In the dog house: Patrick went undercover in a hoodie, which he teamed with shorts and a pair of slippers

Whisked away: The model was picked up by a friend and slumped down inside the car

Bad week: Miley is said to be 'super bummed' about the snaps of Patrick's partying, according to sources  

According to TMZ, some of the messages from her fans - collectively known as the Smilers - bordered on the dangerous and extreme.

'You better run for your life when you come to LA,' one angered fan wrote.

Another added: 'I hope your pizza place burns down,' while a separate troll posed the question, 'Who's gonna kill Patrick for us?'. 

Former flame: Patrick is seen here in 2013 with his former flame Taylor Burns; on Friday more snaps emerged of his escapades in Mexico, where Taylor was seen rubbing sunscreen into his back

Intimate embrace: Patrick was spotted looking very cosy with this bikini-clad woman, who is apparently called Natalie and who he claims is his best friend's girlfriend, on Sunday in Mexico

Another sought humour in the circumstance, joking that they would 'kill Patrick' if he went astray on his famous girlfriend of five months.

On Monday, after images were published of Patrick doing a shot off a bikini-clad girl's tummy, he took to social media and insisted it was just a friend.

He wrote: 'Omg. It's one of my best friends girlfriend... Would NEVER do anything against my GF.....Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...'

Early days of romance: The Wrecking Ball hit-maker has been dating the 21-year-old for around five months. They are pictured here in February
