An accountant who spent £25,000 on plastic surgery to achieve her dream body has been convicted of fraud – after funding her obsession by trying to sell fake gadgets.

Maddison Hawk, 27, boasted she had ‘worked hard to afford my hobby’ when she hit the headlines for splashing out on a full-body overhaul including liposuction and breast implants before her 25th birthday.

But her company is now facing an £8,000 bill after trading standards inspectors discovered she was offering fake GHD hair dryers and hair straighteners for sale on the internet.

One of the imitation products from China burst into flames just seconds after being switched on, a court was told.

Oxfordshire Trading Standards team leader Anu Prashar, who helped the prosecution, said a customer could have been seriously injured.

She said: ‘It was extremely lucky that this happened during a test, rather than when somebody was using the product on their hair, as it could have resulted in serious injury.

‘People may be tempted when they spot cheap designer-branded products online and think that they are the genuine product.

‘Unfortunately, as this case shows, there are sellers out there who take advantage.’

Hawk told earlier this year about how she vowed to give her body a complete overhaul after she had her ears pinned back when she was just six years old. 

Hawk had spoken out earlier this year of how she 'worked hard' to fund the hobby of having a dream body 

She drew up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and as soon as she turned 18 she spent more than £2,000 on semi-permanent make-up. 

Next came a host of chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and a £4,800 boob job boosting her from a 32C to 32H, aged 23.

Hawk then booked in for liposuction on her tummy – and at the last minute decided to have the treatment on her whole body. 

Speaking at the time she said: ‘The way I see it, I’m £25,000 more beautiful than I was before.

‘I work hard to afford my hobby. I don’t go out every weekend but when I do go out, I want to show off my body.’ Oxford magistrates heard she helped to pay for the treatments by selling counterfeit GHD-branded products on shopping website Amazon through her company Perfect Strand.

Prosecutor Sunyana Sharma said a trading standards officer posing as a customer paid £384 for four gift sets of hair dryers and straighteners on May 10 this year.

She said they had GHD logos, but after checking with the company it was ‘very clear’ they were fakes and two were sent for safety testing.

Miss Sharma said one of the hair dryers caught fire seconds after being switched on because it was missing a part which would have turned it off when it started to overheat.

She added: ‘The appliance burst into flames because it did not have a thermal cut off, and for that reason it was deemed unsafe.’

James Reilly, defending, said his client had been ‘naive’, believed the products were genuine, suffered from depression and her company was now being wound up.

Hawk, of Witney, Oxfordshire, admitted four trademark offence charges on behalf of her company and one offence of selling a product that breached safety regulations.

She was ordered to pay a £2,500 fine and a total of £5,838 costs.

An earlier version of this article stated that Ms Hawk had paid for her cosmetic surgery from sales of fake hair straighteners. We are happy to clarify that in fact no counterfeit goods were actually sold to the public and that the surgery was funded separately.
