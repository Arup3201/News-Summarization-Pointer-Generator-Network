The latest figures for websites visited by civil servants reveal 80million viewings of Facebook and 48million to Twitter

Cyberslacking civil servants are spending thousands of hours browsing shopping, social networking and sports websites at the office.

Whitehall officials found time last year to log on to Facebook, Twitter and Sky Sports millions of times, official figures have revealed.

At the Department for Work and Pensions, which is leading the crackdown on ‘skivers’ by capping benefits and running work programmes for the jobless, Google was the most popular website visited with nearly 700million page views, and Facebook was in fifth place with nearly 82milllion views. Twitter was in tenth place with 48million.

The rest of the top ten was filled with sites related to their work, but the officials, paid by the taxpayer, clocked up 19,267,228 visits to Amazon, the 28th most popular site, over 16million to mail-order site Littlewoods in 31st place and 9.5million to used car website Autotrader - which was in 55th place.

Meanwhile at the Department for Communities and Local Government, where Secretary of State Eric Pickles has slashed staffing levels by 40 per cent, there were still 131,468 visits to the website comeonyouspurs.com, which tracks the fortunes of Tottenham Hotspur football club, in the past year and 383,133 hits for esprc.info which displays live cricket scores.

At Mr Pickles’ department, which is much smaller than the DWP, the top visited site was BBC News, with Facebook in sixth place with nearly 2.5million hits and YouTube at number 13 with 932,958.

However, a spokesman said it was part of civil servants work to ‘engage with the public’ on these sites.

Tory MP Priti Patel, a member of the 
Commons Public Administration Committee said: ‘This is outrageous. I 
really do think this is of serious concern across Whitehall that people 
who are paid out of the public purse are spending time on websites which
are clearly not related to their work.

'It is not in line with their professional duty as civil servants and the Government should look into it.’

The top 100 websites visited by civil servants at the two departments were released under Freedom of Information requests.

So-called
‘cyberslacking’ is not restricted to the public sector and is estimated
to cost the economy billions of pounds a year in lost productivity.

Tory MP Priti Patel, left, has described the figures as 'outrageous'. They revealed how civil servants at the Department for Communities and Local Government, led by Eric Pickles, right, visited a Tottenham Hotspur fan site 131, 468 times

In 2011, officials at the Department for Transport were forced to release records of their staff’s online activity which included checking lottery results, booking holidays and even planning belly dancing lessons.

A website dedicated to ranking MPs in order of attractiveness - sexymp.co.uk - had been visited 21,477 times.

Tory MP Nick de Bois added: ‘It seems government will never learn. Eighteen months on and it seems civil servants are still preoccupied with Facebook and shopping. Members of the public will find it hard to understand.’

A DCLG spokesman said staff were allowed to surf the web in their lunch hour and after work, and that line managers ensured their staff were not using the web inappropriately during work hours.

He added that staff used social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube to ‘engage with the public.’

At the DWP, a spokeswoman said staff could use the internet outside working hours, and added: ‘For the small minority who don’t abide by the internet usage rules, we have disciplinary measures in place.’
