Health officials are reporting seven more cases of measles in an outbreak tied to visits to Disney theme parks in California last month.

The new cases confirmed Monday by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) brings the total to 26 people in four states.

Officials say 22 of the cases are in California and two are in Utah, with one apiece in Colorado and Washington.

Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between December 15 and December 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited. 

Measles outbreak: The new measles cases include three reported Monday in Southern California, including two in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach

The new cases include three reported Monday in Southern California, including two in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach.

Long Beach City Health Officer Mitchell Kushner said in a release that January 3 potential exposure sites in town included a Total Wellness Club, supermarket Stater Brothers, a Bank of America, and a Wells Fargo branch. The exposure would have been from 9am to 11:30am.

Kushner said 'The Long Beach resident spent time at the Disneyland Resort in the City of Anaheim, during the period of December 16-20, 2014.' 

Other locations have been listed by officials as potential exposure sites, The Los Angeles Times reported. 

They include Cabazon's Morongo Casino on January 4 between 6 and 11:30pm, Chino's Magic Wok on January 6 between 3 and 5pm, Whittier's Jimmy Warehouse Sportscard between 3 and 10pm, as well as Urgent Care at Pomona Valley Health Center on January 8 between 3:56 and 5:05 pm, also located in Chino. 

Last week the CDPH said it had confirmed cases in Alameda, Orange, Pasadena, Riverside, as well as San Diego.

There is also a case in Ventura County, according to The Los Angeles Times. 

CDPH said last week that 'Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.'

The agency also explained 'Measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000. However, large measles outbreaks have occurred in Western Europe, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years.

'Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles. Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.'

Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance.
