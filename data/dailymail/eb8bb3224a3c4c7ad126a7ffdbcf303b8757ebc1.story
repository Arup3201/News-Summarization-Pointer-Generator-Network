England captain Steven Gerrard admitted Thursday's game against Uruguay was 'a must-win' for Roy Hodgson's men following the 2-1 defeat in their World Cup opener against Italy.

Costa Rica's shock 3-1 victory over Uruguay had blown Group D open before Mario Balotelli's strike claimed the points for the Azzurri on Saturday night.

Afterwards Gerrard said: 'No matter what the result was tonight we knew we would still have had to go and beat Uruguay. The challenge is a little bit more difficult but it is certainly do able.'

Gerrard said England were disappointed not to come away with at least a draw after an encouraging performance in Manaus.

He added: 'Italy are a good team and we knew how 
they were going to play and they never surprised us really but it is 
disappointing to put so much into it and and come away with nothing.'

Manager
 Roy Hodgson was pleased with the performance and the displays of the likes of Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck and Ross Barkley.

He said: 'The positive I can take is that is the best I have 
seen the team play in my time with them.

'It is very good to know and 
so many players who will help us become a much better team going forward
 and I suppose we have to bite the bullet and accept that we played well
 but we beaten by a very good team.

'Raheem Sterling was bright as we hoped he would be. Ross Barkley did well, we know what Danny Welbeck did and be did it well.

'Jack
 Wilshere hasn't had many games. None of them let their qcountry down at
 all. They did everything we asked except score the equalising goal.

'If we play like that in our next two games we hope to be able to get a result.

'We
 cannot drift to qualification. We are in the back foot with Uruguay. We
 have to give the right performance to give us victory.

'Normally
 you arrive one say before a game, we arrived two days. We didn't have 
any problems adapting to the conditions. We didn't suffer, we should 
have been suffering towards the end but we spent most of the end in the 
Italian half,' he said.
