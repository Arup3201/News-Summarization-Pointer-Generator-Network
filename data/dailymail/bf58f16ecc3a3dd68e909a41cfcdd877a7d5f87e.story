Radamel Falcao’s agent has cast fresh doubt on the striker’s Manchester United future by insisting he should play every week.

Falcao was left out of the United squad by Louis van Gaal for the Barclays Premier League defeat at home by Southampton on Sunday and Sportsmail  revealed on Monday that the 28-year-old loanee has serious doubts about whether he will be offered a permanent contract at the end of the season.

Now Falcao’s representative Jorge Mendes has suggested the Colombia star, who has started just eight games under Van Gaal, would play regularly for any other team and admitted he may leave United in the summer.

604 - Minutes played for United so far

3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions

201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33

£40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages

£1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages)

Mendes — who hardly ever speaks publicly — said: ‘I don’t know (if he will stay). He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans — they have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club. 

‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works — we’ll see what happens.’

United have a close relationship with Mendes. He brought them Cristiano Ronaldo 10 years ago and currently represents stars such as goalkeeper David de Gea.

Understandably, the Old Trafford hierarchy would like to maintain that relationship but at the moment the benefits of paying £43million to keep Falcao beyond this season do not look obvious.

The former Atletico Madrid striker has scored only three goals for United and Mendes has revealed there is already interest from Italy, particularly Juventus.

Falcao is likely to be back in Van Gaal’s team this Saturday when United face QPR in London. Fellow striker Robin van Persie is struggling with an ankle injury and Falcao is the natural replacement.

Another United forward who is finding it difficult to get a look-in under Van Gaal is Adnan Januzaj — and the Belgian is expecting to be loaned out later this transfer window.

Last season he was courted by top clubs across Europe and, indeed, the England national team, after breaking through under previous boss David Moyes.
