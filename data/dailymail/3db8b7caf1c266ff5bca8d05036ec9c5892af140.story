There's no doubt that Aussie Rules football is a religion for many Australians, but now a Muslim mother is making sure everyone can join in, designing a line of burqas in the colours of your favourite AFL team.

Melbourne mother-of-four Shanaaz Copeland is the mastermind behind Unity Sports Wrap scarves which can been worn as a beanie, wrap or a headscarf.

They were unveiled ahead of the league’s multicultural round from July 18 to 27.

Melbourne's Shanaaz Copeland designed a range of scarves ahead of the AFL Multicultural Round which are being modelled here by her daughters

Ms Copeland - a devout Muslim - said the idea came about because she wanted her daughters to feel more included when they were attending sporting events at school.

She has been working on the scarves concept for the past three to four years.

'My daughters go to an international academy where they wear a white scarf with their uniform,' Ms Copeland said.

'They had a footy day and in wearing footy jumper with their white scarf.

They went on sale yesterday and come in all 18 AFL team colours

'I saw them and thought "how great would it be to see my girls with scarves in the footy team colours?"'

Ms Copeland said sport was a great way to break down barriers and forge friendships across cultures.

'Sport has the tendency to create unity, it brings cultures together… [and] brings about peace and unity,' she said.

'This round of footy shows how supportive the AFL is to diversity with the diverse multicultural backgrounds.

'Australia is really growing, becoming very multicultural, very important for us all to understand each other’s cultures.'

The scarves come in all 18 AFL team colours and can be worn by players as well as fans.

The Unity Sports Wrap can be worn three ways - one of them is as a headscarf

The range of scarves has been applauded by cultural experts who say it is a step in the right direction

Centre for Australian Community Organisations and Management's Hazel Maxwell, from the University of Technology, Sydney, has commended the AFL for licensing Unity Sports Wrap to create these scarves.

Dr Maxwell said the AFL was sending a positive message to their Islamic female supporters.

'Research shows that "accommodating" dress codes are one of several initiatives that can make Muslim women, for example, feel more welcome and to feel as though they belong in Australian society,' she said.

'At the Lakemba Sport and Recreation Club in south-western Sydney, such changes over the last decade have turned the club around from a situation where membership was declining at a concerning rate to the point where the number of teams it could field virtually tripled in the space of a few years.

'As well as a flexible on-field dress code, Lakemba Sport and Recreation introduced women-only training sessions, provided culturally appropriate food, sold only non-alcoholic drinks and displayed prominently role models of Muslim women playing football.'

Unity Sports Wrap scarves went on sale yesterday.

The AFL are also offering anyone with an international passport free entry into any AFL game as a part of the Multicultural Round this weekend
