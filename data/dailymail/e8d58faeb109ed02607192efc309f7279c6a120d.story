A man who had occupied a cypress tree for 11 days to block construction of a premier golf course in New Orleans' large public park has fallen from the tree and injured himself.

The man, identified as Jonathan Boover, who goes by Lloyd, fell out of the tree in City Park on Tuesday morning.

Christopher Lane of the City Park for Everyone Coalition says Boover apparently had not eaten in a day and was disoriented from lack of sleep. 

Hold on: Jonathan Boover, who goes by the name Lloyd, fell from this cypress tree in City Park, New Orleans, on Tuesday, 11 days after first climbing the tree to protest a new golf course

Protest: Boover was trying to draw attention to the 100 or more trees that are being torn down in City Park, to clear the way for a new $24.5 million golf course

Injured: Jonathan 'Lloyd' Boover is believed to have broken his ankle and nose after falling from the tree

Construction: Work is currently underway at the park for a new golf course, which will cost $24.5 million cut down 100 trees in the area

Lane says Boover believed he may have broken an ankle and his nose in the fall.

Sheriff's deputies had been monitoring Boover's protest and kept a spotlight trained on him at night. 

He was expected to be charged with trespassing.

Boover said he was happy to 'spend a few days in jail' if it meant more people would hear about the $24.5 million golf course being built along park along Harrison Avenue.

About 100 trees will be chopped down for the course.

Boover says there was already a gold course in the park, and that the trees shouldn't need to be demolished.

Scene: Emergency crews at City Park Tuesday after Jonathan 'Lloyd' Boover fell from this tree

Demonstration: Boover said he was more than willing to spend time in jail in order to draw people's attention to the trees that are being destroyed in the park

Wild is Free: Boover snuck into the construction on Friday March 13

Broover, along with a friend known as 'Heart', jumped the green fence that surrounds the construction site last on March 13.

He scaled the oak tree in the rain while workers couldn't see.

'These are old growth trees and they are trying to degrade them,' Heart told NOLA.com.

Boover was believed to have been waving to one of many fans that had congregated to wish him well when he flipped out his hammock and fell to the ground.

'I said ''Hi, Lloyd'',' the woman said. 'He waved and hit the ground.'

Boover immediately got back in the tree, however then realized he needed medical attention.

Emergency crews were called to the park and he was taken to hospital.
