Kasey Naylor, 14, died  weeks after she was prescribed prescription drugs not licensed for children

A troubled teenager died after being given prescription medication which was only meant for adults, an inquest heard.

Kasey Naylor, 14, was found lifeless in bed just weeks after being handed the anti-psychotic drug quetiapine and anti-depressant, sertraline.

Both are unlicensed for use in children, Manchester Coroner's Court heard, although the consultant psychiatrist who prescribed them said they were 'commonly used' to treat youngsters. 

Kasey who attended Manchester Creative and Media Academy started to self harm in June 2013 and in September this year she was admitted to hospital after she cut her arm badly and threatened to kill herself.

Dr David Ochando prescribed quetiapine after seeing Kasey at North Manchester General on September 10 last year and agreed to discharge her the next day after she had shown no sign of low blood pressure, a common side-effect.

Quetiapine is an anti-psychotic drug used to treat bipolar and schizophrenia. 

When he saw her again nine days later he also prescribed the anti-depressant sertraline as quetiapine is only considered a short-term remedy for emotional problems, the inquest heard.

Sertraline affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression, panic, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

Although not recommended for patients under 18 years old, the inquest was told by a medical experts that use of such drugs is common and that the risk of death 'extremely rare.'

Dr Ochando saw her a third time at her home on September 25, when she mentioned she had not been taking sertraline as she 'didn't see the point.' 

 Kasey's mother Paula Longhorn wept as she told the hearing: 'She was just my Kasey. She was just everything. She was lovely.'

Coroner Nick Stanage reviewed her statement and said: 'You say she had a few problems at school. 

'Kasey had cut herself so badly at school that it required hospital treatment. 

'You went to school and were told that Kasey had put a knife to her own throat and she said she would kill herself.

Kasey Naylor's mother Paula Longhorn described the teenager, pictured, as her 'everything' and said she 'was lovely'

'While she was at the hospital Kasey had to be restrained but then she was discharged later that night.'

Mrs Longhorn replied: 'She told me about what she was going. Sometimes she would show me the cuts and sometimes she wouldn't. 

'School would ring up and say she needs to go to the hospital because she has cuts on her arms.'

The coroner recounted the morning Mrs Longhorn found her daughter unresponsive in her bed at her home in Newton Heath, Manchester, on October 8.

'You entered Kasey's room and the alarm was still going off,' said the coroner.

'Kasey was a funny colour. You touched her and she was cold.'

Attempts to resuscitate Kasey were carried out but she was later declared dead. 

Her psychiatrist Dr David Ochando told the inquest that the use of unlicensed drugs such as Quetiapine are commonly used for children.

He said: 'There are very few medications that have a licence for young people or children and that is in regards to mental health issues.

'Like many other medications it has a licence to be used for psychiatric illness in adults - for people with bipolar.

'But these groups of medication that do not have a license are not recommended for people under 18.

'There are a number of reasons why. It is very difficult to find evidence that they work on children.' 

When asked by the family if there were any licensed medications he could have prescribed, Dr Ochando said: 'They are all unlicensed. There is no licensed medication for children that age.'

A pathologist, who conducted a post mortem examination on the teenager, was unable to determine a cause of Kasey's death.

Forensic pathologist, Mark Tyler said: 'Quetiapine is a anti-psychotic drug used for schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorders. It is reported to have some adverse effects when taken therapeutically including drowsiness and headaches.

'There are also reports of effects to the heart. It can affect the rhythm of your heart beat and can lead to irregular heart rhythm although this is considered to be extremely rare. The cause of a cardiac event would increase with a higher dose.

'Quetiapine is not generally recommended for children under 18. There is a lack of clinical trials to support its use rather than a specific risk of prescribing it for that age group. Therefore it may be prescribed for under 18s in some instances. The risk of cardiac event is extremely small when used in therapeutic doses.'

Coroner Mr Stanage recorded an open verdict and said: 'I cannot say it was an accident or accidental death. 

'I cannot say it was drugs-related or related to prescribed drugs as the evidence is the medication was prescribed only in therapeutic doses or levels.'
