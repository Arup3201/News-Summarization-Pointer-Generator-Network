The same federal scientist who recently found forgotten samples of 
smallpox at a federal lab also uncovered over 300 additional vials, many
 bearing the names of highly contagious viruses and bacteria.

Food
 and Drug Administration officials said Wednesday the undocumented 
collection contained 327 carefully packaged vials, listing pathogens 
like dengue, influenza and rickettsia.

Last week the government only 
disclosed that it had recovered six glass vials of smallpox dating from 
the 1950s.

The new revelations raise serious concerns about the 
government's ability to secure its collections of potentially deadly 
pathogens.

'The reasons why these samples went unnoticed for this
 long is something we're actively trying to understand,' said FDA deputy
 director for biologics Dr. Peter Marks.

The samples, including 
those labeled smallpox, were found in 12 boxes in a corner of a cold 
storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland,
 that has been used by the Food and Drug Administration since 1972.

FDA 
officials estimate the collection was assembled between 1946 and 1964 by
 government scientists.

'The fact that these materials were not 
discovered until now is unacceptable,' said Karen Midthun, of FDA's 
director for biologics. 'However, upon finding these materials our staff
 did the right thing â€” they immediately notified the appropriate 
authorities who secured the materials and determined there was no 
exposure.'

FDA scientists said they have not yet confirmed 
whether the newly disclosed vials actually contained the pathogens 
listed on their labels. The agency is conducting a nationwide search of 
all cold storage units for any other missing samples.

Investigators
 destroyed 32 vials containing tissue samples and a non-contagious virus
 related to smallpox. Several unlabeled vials were sent to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention for testing and the remaining 279 
samples were shipped to the Department of Homeland Security for 
safekeeping.

FDA officials said there is no evidence anyone was exposed 
to any of the agents, which were packed in heat-sealed glass vials with 
no signs of leakage.

The finding of freeze-dried smallpox samples
 was disturbing because smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and 
world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely 
stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia.

It 
was the second recent incident in which a U.S. government health agency 
appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous biologic agent.

Last 
month, scores of employees at the CDC in Atlanta were feared exposed to 
anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse. The CDC began giving them 
antibiotics as a precaution.

In separate congressional testimony 
Wednesday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden acknowledged that systemic 
safety problems have for years plagued federal public health 
laboratories that handle dangerous germs such as anthrax and bird flu. 
Frieden added that his agency had long thought of the lapses as 
unrelated accidents.
