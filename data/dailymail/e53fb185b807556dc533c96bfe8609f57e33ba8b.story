Occupy Wall Street protesters have begun to squabble over money with some demanding a reported $500,000 the movement has in its bank be shared more equally.

And with the cold weather beginning to take a firm grip on New York City, doubts have been raised as to whether the anti-corporation demonstration can make it through the winter.

It has also emerged that Zuccotti Park, the focus of the protest since it begun on September 17, is providing an alluring home for vagrants, at the same time as those within the movement cautioned against spreading the demonstration too thinly.

Ironic? News of a fallout over money seems to run in contrast with the anti-corporation ethos of the Occupy Wall Street movement

Bedding down: The increasingly cold winter weather is also a cause for concern for protesters, who are not allowed to erect tents

Yet given Occupy Wall Street's (OWS) anti-establishment ethos, the main worry for the hundreds camped out in New York's financial district will be the battle over money.

Donations are pouring in, but gripes over how that money is spent is threatening to split the protesters apart.

A Finance Committee has been set up to deal with cashflow, and assign it to working collectives with the movement so essential items can be bought. But those denied funds are getting angry.

For example, a set of drums was vandalised one night last week, however the Finance Committee has refused a request for $8,000 to replace them.

'F**k Finance. I hope Mayor Bloomberg gets an injunction and demands to see the movement’s books,' Bryan Smith, a 45-year-old protester who joined OWS from Los Angeles three weeks ago told the New York Post.

'We need to know how much money we really have and where it’s going.'

Mr Smith, who works in TV production, is a member of the Comfort Working Group, which is charged with finding out what basic necessities campers need, such as thermal underwear, and then raising money by asking for donations on the street, the New York Post reported.

Working groups: A number of groups have been set up with defined purposes, but some are getting annoyed at requests for money being turned down

Tents please: A petition is underway to push for tents to be allowed at Zuccotti Park, but Mayor Bloomberg is resistant to relaxing the laws. Tarpaulin sheets must make do instead

Advice: On-site nurses are telling people to stay wrapped up and dry, words which this little pooch has heeded

'The other day, I took in $2,000. I kept $650 for my group, and gave the rest to Finance, he told the paper.

'Then I went to them with a request - so many people need things, and they should not be going without basic comfort items - and I was told to fill out paperwork. Paperwork! Are they the government now?

'We need winter gear, shoes, socks. I could spend $10,000 alone for backpacks people need. We raise all this money. Where is it?'

One rainy night last week, someone stabbed holes in many of the protesters' drums with a knife, Elijah Moses told the New York Post.

The 19-year-old, a founder of the Pulse Working Group, asked for $8,000 to replace the drums, and build a small shed to lock them up.

'They said no - they turned us down. I’m really frustrated,' he told the paper.

Haven for the homeless: There are reports of vagrants moving to Zuccotti park in New York because of community feel and free food

Pete Dutro, 36, a Brooklyn tattoo artist studying a master's in finance and sits on the Finance Committee, said big purchases can't get the green light straight away.

'We don’t have the power for that. They have to go to the General Assembly. If it's approved, we pay out that amount and make sure everything is accounted for,' he told the New york Post.

The funding fight emerged as a number of protesters voiced concerns over the coming freezing temperatures - as tents are forbidden.

At night, the several hundred people who sleep on site in the financial district currently huddle together using plastic tarps, sleeping bags and emergency blankets.

But the worst is yet to come. 'So far, we have been extremely blessed,' Cynthia Villarreal, who has slept at Zuccotti for 18 days, told AFP.

Zuccotti Park has so far experienced only a handful of rainy days, while at night, temperatures are still above freezing.

However New York winters often see temperatures drop below 14F (-10C) and some are beginning to worry.

'The cold affects us already,' Maria Fehlig, a volunteer nurse at the protesters' makeshift infirmary, told AFP.

She described how there had been several cases of hypothermia and respiratory problems. An online petition is asking New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to allow protesters to erect tents on the plaza, though it has not yet been sent.

Its chances of success seem slim, though, with Mr Bloomberg saying earlier this week: 'The Constitution doesn't protect tents, it protects speech and assembly.'

But Ms Fehlig, who has been teaching protesters basic methods for battling the cold, insisted that they formed 'a determined group that plans to stay until it changes.'

She is informing demonstrators to stay dry, wear hats, layers of clothing and good pairs of socks and gloves, AFP reported.

Meanwhile the New York Daily News has reported a growing number of homeless people are flocking to the site, as it provides a safe, community environment, along with free food.

'I think this is a better situation to be involved with,' 49-year-old Matthew Maloney, who was released from prison last month and spent time in a Staten Island shelter, told the New York Daily News.

'I am around a good cause and around positive people, rather than in that other environment,' Maloney, who has drifted in and out of the state prison system for more than three decades for a variety of crimes, including robbery and possession of stolen property, told the paper.

Bronx couple Yvette Vigo and Orlando Nieves told the Daily News they were forced into a shelter a year ago when they could no longer afford rent.

'I feel safer out here than I did in a shelter,' Ms Vigo, 45, said. 'It's a big area with a lot of kind people.'

Organisers yesterday put up a large flat-screen TV in Zuccotti Park for a movie night in an effort to attract new recruits following a lacklustre showing at a police-brutality event in Union Square which attracted only 50 participants.
