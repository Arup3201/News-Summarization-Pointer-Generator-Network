Tottenham are the leading contenders to sign Manchester United's Danny Welbeck before the transfer deadline.

Mauricio Pochettino is keen to add another forward to his ranks but the Argentine could face competition from Arsenal, who are still in the market for a new striker.

The Gunners have missed out on Monaco's Radamel Falcao, who is set to seal a season-long loan move to Manchester United on Monday evening.

Arsene Wenger views Welbeck as more of a wide player, while the England man himself wants a chance to prove himself through the middle as a central striker.

He could be given more chances in that role at Spurs, but Arsenal's need for a goalscorer could see them take a chance on Welbeck.

The 23-year-old is currently training with England  but that won't stop him leaving the team hotel later to secure a loan deal. 

Manager Roy Hodgson has said he will allow players to talk to clubs if it is about a move.

Out of favour: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is willing to allow Welbeck to leave the club

Fresh start: Welbeck has enjoyed previous loan spells with Preston North End and Sunderland
