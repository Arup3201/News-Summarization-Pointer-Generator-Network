Chelsea's highly rated midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah has joined Championship strugglers Reading on loan until the end of the season.

Reading are 18th in the league and but manager Steve Clarke knows more about Chalobah's potential than most, as he was an assistant to Jose Mourinho during the Portuguese's first tenure at Stamford Bridge.

The England under-21 international's versatility means he  also offers cover in defence and Clarke believes Chalobah can help guide The Royals further away from the drop zone.

'Nathaniel is a good young player who I have known about and followed for some time,' Clarke said to Reading's official website.

'He burst onto the scene as a 17-year-old when he was part of the Watford team that narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League in 2012-13. Since that season, he has gained experience at other clubs and now feels that Reading is the right club to further his development as a player.'

The 20-year-old Chalobah will be available to make his debut in the FA Cup fourth round clash with Cardiff City in Wales on Saturday.
