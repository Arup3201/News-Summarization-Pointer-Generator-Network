An expectant mother with diabetes tweeted her gratitude today after she fainted while standing behind Barack Obama during his speech about healthcare reforms - and was caught by the President himself.

Karmel Allison, from San Diego, was representing the American Diabetes Association at the event in the Rose Garden at the White House on Monday.

Around 25 minutes into the speech, Ms Allison became
 unsteady and started to lose consciousness but the President, and other
 attendees, turned around and grabbed her before she fainted.

Obama caught Ms Allison by the arm, 
saying: 'I got you. You're OK.' She was escorted away for medical 
assistance as the crowd applauded the President's quick reaction.

Obama then joked: 'That's what happens when I talk too long.'

Ms Allison, who was diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes when she was nine years old, later reassured the public that she was okay and had been checked out by a White House doctor.

She told CNN on Monday: 'Next thing I knew I was being caught by the president and thinking "wow that just happened".

'I am extremely embarrassed that I fainted but honored still to have been there.'

According to website A Sweet Life,
 to which she contributes as science editor, Ms Allison was born in 
southern California, and went to UC Berkeley graduating in 2006 with a 
B.A. in Linguistics.

She 
now lives with her husband in San Diego, where she works in computational
 
biology at the University of California.

Michael is chief technology 
officer and co-founder at Nulu, and founder and chief technology officer 
at Minute7.com. The couple also have a computer company, Arcaio Inc.

She writes in her biography that she 'is loving the sunshine (in San Diego) ... and learning to use 
the active voice when talking about her diabetes'.

In her spare time, she says she enjoys 'people, Milan Kundera, rock climbing, and the pursuit of 
life, liberty, and happiness.' 

Carmel's husband Michael Allison, pictured with her, tweeted that he almost went to her aid on stage but thought the Secret Service might get confused if he lunged towards the President

Mr Obama reached out to help 
prospective Affordable Care Act beneficiary Ms Allison who was 
standing directly behind him as he discussed the glitches of the new 
healthcare website in the Rose Garden of the White House.

Ms
 Allison later tweeted: 'I'm ok world - just got a little 
lightheaded.Thanks, @BarackObama for catching me! And good thing this 
pregnant diabetic is pregnant :)'

Her husband, David 
Allison, tweeted his thanks to Mr Obama then in a follow up said he had 
wanted to go to his wife's aid but thought better of it, fearing the 
Secret Service may get confused if he started bolting towards the 
podium.

Ms
 Allison was invited to the event at the White House because she suffers from Type-1 Diabetes and has always 
struggled to find affordable healthcare.

She
 said she was lucky to have insurance already when she was diagnosed and
 stayed on the same plan, despite constantly rising costs, because she 
was scared another insurer would reject her due to her pre-existing 
condition.

She said 
she recently began 
researching her options on CoveredCA and was elated to find she could 
now qualify for low-cost insurance despite her diabetes.

She said she 
finally feels equal to others, including her healthy husband, when it 
comes to accessing coverage.

A few hours after her turn, she told CNN she was 'feeling much better' and that she thought dehydration may have caused her to feel lightheaded during the event.

'I'm
 20 weeks pregnant at this point and I hadn't had that much to drink 
that morning because I was worried about possibly needing to go to the 
bathroom during the speech,' she said in a phone interview. 'And as the 
sun hit me, I got a little lightheaded.'

Ms Allison said she was treated by the White House physician.

'Now I get to say that ACA got me care by the White House medical professional,' she joked.

Before the hammer fell: In a Rose Garden speech, just the pictured pregnant woman famously fell, Obama called Sanford's story, which she emailed to the White House, 'what the Affordable Care Act is all about'

Just in time: The President turns around and catches Allison just as she's about to faint, and the man standing behind her grabs her shoulders

Help: Allison is then escorted away. She later tweeted that she was feeling OK now and thanked Mr Obama

It didn't take long before skeptics started suggesting the health scare was a fake and Ms Allison was planted there by the Obama administration.

But her husband insisted the near-collapse was no fake.

Ms Allison became dizzy towards the end 
of a defiant speech during which Mr Obama said he was mad about problems
 with the new health care website, but argued that the Affordable Care 
Act as a whole is working as planned.

While Healthcare.gov 'hasn't worked 
as smoothly as it was supposed to work,' Obama said during the White 
House speech that once-uninsured Americans have signed up for coverage 
and are receiving benefits, 'The product -- the health insurance -- is good,' Mr Obama said.

'The prices are good. It is a good deal.'

Facing
 attacks from Republicans and other critics of Obamacare, the president 
said his health care team is reaching out to tech experts to help fix 
massive website problems that have hampered the rollout of his landmark 
piece of legislation.

'Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't working as well as it should,' Mr Obama said, 'which means it's going to get fixed.'

Aside from the website, Mr Obama said the new health care law is providing consumer protections and benefits for millions of Americans, including mammograms and birth control services. He told stories of now-covered Americans who had once been denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions.

'The essence of the law, the health insurance that's available to people, is working just fine,' Mr Obama said.
