A dog owner killed a man by dropping a fridge on his head after becoming convinced his pet had been kidnapped, a murder trial heard today.

Cameron McFly, 38, believed his victim, Richard Ward, 37, had taken the dog and entered it into an illegal fight, the OId Bailey was told.

He is alleged to have attacked Mr Ward after leading him into a darkened alley behind a supermarket.

McFly punched and kicked his victim before stealing his cash and using it to buy cigarettes and alcohol, a jury was told.

He then returned to finish off the attack by dropping the kitchen appliance on the victim’s head as Danny Samuel, 36, joined in the savage beating, the court heard.

'Attack': Cameron McFly and Danny Samuel are on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of murdering Richard Ward last November

McFly is said to have made a calculated effort to cover his tracks by burning his clothes and shaving off his hair.

He admits he was responsible for the attack on Mr Ward, but claims he was suffering from mental illness at the time.

Samuel claims he was invited into the alley by McFly, but insists he took no part in the attack which followed.

Mr Ward was attacked in the loading bay of a Waitrose supermarket in Severus Road, Clapham Junction, south-west London, on November 7 last year.

He was caught on CCTV at around 10.50pm holding both of McFly’s dogs on leads, the court heard.

Minutes later, he was guided to the rear of the supermarket before being ‘systematically assaulted’ by McFly, prosecutor Roger Smart told the court.

‘The prosecution say that McFly used kicks and punches directed towards the head of Richard Ward, he told jurors. ‘This is the last time Richard Ward is seen alive.’

He was disturbed midway through his attack and fled to a nearby Sainsbury’s store where he bought cans of pre-mixed Jack Daniels and Coke and a pack of 10 JPS cigarettes.

Prosecutors believe he paid for the goods with money stolen from his victim. He was also seen flirting with a female customer.

The court was told that McFly met up with Samuel while he was returning to the Waitrose yard and boasted about the attack he had launched minutes earlier.

Samuel claims that when he asked McFly what the victim had done to him, he replied: ‘Oh, kidnap the dog and put it in a dog fight and everything else.’

It was shortly afterwards that the two men resumed the attack, which culminated in McFly dropping a fridge on Mr Ward’s head, the court heard.

The pair fled when they were disturbed by Waitrose staff.

DNA from both McFly and Samuel was found on a car parked in the loading bay, along with McFly’s fingerprints, the jury was told.

McFly and Samuel, both of Hebdon Road, Tooting, south-west London, deny murder.

The trial continues. 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
