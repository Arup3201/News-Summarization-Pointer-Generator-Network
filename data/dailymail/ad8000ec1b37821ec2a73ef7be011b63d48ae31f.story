Getting better: The Queen walked unaided out of the Marylebone hospital this afternoon after being taken there for treatment 
last night

Only a day after being admitted to hospital for the first time in a decade, the Queen was yesterday well enough to go home.

And far from spending the next week recuperating, as doctors have suggested, the Mail has learnt that she returned to work straight away.

Instead of heading back to Windsor Castle last night, the monarch, who turns 87 next month, insisted on returning to Buckingham Palace to be briefed by her private office staff.

She was joined by the 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who had a public engagement at the Royal Thames Yacht Club in Knightsbridge last night.

And even though she is expected to return to Windsor Castle at some point this week, she will continue to receive the ‘red boxes’ of official paperwork that follow her wherever she goes.

The monarch, who will celebrate the 60th anniversary of her coronation in June, went down with a debilitating case of gastoenteritis on Friday and was advised to rest at Windsor Castle for the weekend.

The Queen much prefers the relative informal nature of Windsor to Buckingham Palace and considers it to be her true ‘home’.

But on Sunday afternoon, concerned doctors decided she should be taken to King Edward VII hospital for monitoring.

And although Buckingham Palace said she would be kept in for two days, her racing green Bentley accompanied by four police outriders unexpectedly arrived outside the central London hospital yesterday lunchtime.

The Queen, who had earlier in the day been visited and given the all-clear by her personal physician, Professor John Cunningham, stepped briskly through the front door.

Wearing a pillar-box red coat with Queen Victoria’s diamond bow brooch pinned to her left shoulder and her beloved pearls around her neck, the Queen had a sparkle in her eye and a spring in her step.

The only possible sign of her treatment was a black glove on her left hand, which might have been to cover the tell-tale signs of an intravenous drip.

With a handbag over one arm, and clutching a neck scarf and one glove as she prepared to shake the hands of waiting hospital staff, the Queen emerged in good spirits

She left hospital this afternoon after being admitted with symptoms of gastroenteritis 24 hours ago

Despite suffering from debilitating sickness, the 86-year-old refused to allow an ambulance to collect her

This morning she received a visit from her personal physician, Professor John Cunningham, who arrived by scooter. The visit it is believed to have led to her being discharged

It would be entirely routine for him to assess the Queen in this way, in addition to the care she is receiving from the private hospital's own staff

Doctors monitored the Queen very closely before her exit. They were checking that the 86-year-old was properly hydrated and monitoring her pulse and blood pressure

After warmly thanking the nursing staff for their care, she sped off without a glance at the waiting cameras.

A few minutes later her standard rose at Buckingham Palace, indicating that her first stop was her official London home.

A source told the Mail: ‘The Queen will be staying at Buckingham Palace overnight.’

She has cancelled her official 
engagements for the rest of the week, including a two-day trip to Rome, 
but it is anticipated that she will be well enough to undertake a number
 of official engagements scheduled for next week.

It was only the fifth occasion in her six- decade reign that the Queen had been taken to hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for acute pregnancy-related sickness in December

Doctors have speculated that the Queen is suffering from norovirus, the winter vomiting bug that closes hundreds of hospital wards every year

Despite being allowed home the Queen's diary for this week would remain suspended, the Palace has confirmed

Her Majesty did - 'reluctantly' -  agree to cancel her engagements for the next week, including a high-profile visit to Rome, which indicates that the stomach bug which struck on Friday has taken its toll

The first is the annual Commonwealth 
Observance multi-faith service at Westminster Abbey in London on Monday,
 which is followed by a reception held by the Commonwealth 
Secretary‑General at Marlborough House.

She is also due to attend a service at
 the Guards’ Chapel to commemorate the 175th Anniversary of the Soldiers
 and Airmen’s Scripture Readers Association on Thursday.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen was in ‘good spirits’.

She added: ‘Engagements cancelled or 
postponed this week remain so. Next week we’ll have to see, as she has 
only just been released from hospital.’

The Queen has been hospitalised on 
only a handful of occasions during her six decades on the throne, the 
previous time being in December 2003 when she underwent surgery on her 
left knee.

Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, the most common symptoms being vomiting and diarrhoea.

Visit: Professor John Cunningham, the Queen's physician, leaves King Edward VII hospital on his scooter just before it was announced The Queen was to return home

The Queen was being treated in the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge stayed just three months ago with severe morning sickness.

Tragically, a few days after the Duchess was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in central London, a nurse committed suicide after a hoax phone call.

Jacintha Saldanha spoke to two DJs from an Australian radio station – who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles – asking for an update of the Duchess’s condition and put them through to a nurse on her ward.

Hospital pranked: While the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured outside the King Edward VII Hospital, was treated for acute morning sickness it was subjected to a hoax-phone call which was blamed for a nurse's suicide

The 46-year-old was found hanged in her living quarters after a recording of the conversation was broadcast worldwide.

Hospital staff have insisted the nurse 
was not reprimanded for taking the call, but sources close to the family
 claim she was ‘ticked-off’.

Senior managers were also accused of 
failing to support the devastated nurse after the prank because they 
were more concerned about the hospital’s image.

Big protection: PC Wallyn and a colleague outside the hospital last night

But the Queen’s admission to the private hospital on Sunday indicates it is still trusted by the Royal Family.

The Queen is the hospital’s patron and in December 2003, underwent an operation there to remove torn cartilage from her left knee.

A night’s stay reportedly costs £1,000 and each room has an en-suite bathroom and large flat-screen TV.

The hospital says it recruits the highest-performing doctors in the country and claims to be so clean there has never been a case of MRSA or C-difficile.

The Queen can also take heart that Britain’s tallest policeman is standing guard outside the hospital.

At 7ft 2in, Anthony Wallyn, 26, of the Westminster Police Borough Support Unit, was among the officers manning the door.

PC Wallyn, who has his uniform custom made and imports his size 17 shoes from America, said he was used to the attention his height attracted.

He said: ‘If I work in the West End, I get anywhere between 100 and 500 requests for a photo. It’s like being famous but without the money.’
