Teacher Jeremiah Gorman, 35, was being investigated for child pornography posession when he was found dead in a motel room on Saturday

A Maine teacher who was being investigated for possession of child pornography was found dead in a motel room.

Jeremiah Gorman, 35, was a social sciences teacher at John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor and had been placed under investigation just the day before his body was discovered on Saturday. 

Mel MacKay, the school's head of administration, said law enforcement officials believe Gorman died in an apparent suicide.

The private school was informed on Friday that Gorman, who has a son, was under investigation. 

Detectives had asked for his classroom to be opened for a search,  MacKay wrote in an email sent out to parents and students, according to the Bangor Daily News. 

Gorman's home had also been searched. 

MacKay said that Monday's school day would begin with a special assembly regarding the matter and that counseling services would be available to all students, faculty and staff.

'This has been an extraordinarily fast-developing situation in which issues of student and child safety have been at the forefront, as they must always be,' he wrote. 

'At the same time, we are aware that the emotional needs of students, parents, faculty and staff, and Mr Gorman's own family call for our attention and support.'
