A dog had to plucked to safety by rescuers after it fell through ice on a pond and could not escape.

Firefighters rescued the Springer Spaniel called Milo after it plunged through ice on a pond at Eastwood Farm nature reserve in Broomhill, Bristol, and was unable to get to safety.

The owner of Milo, aged two and a half, called 999 after he fell into the water during a walk.

He slipped through the ice and was in the water for around 25 minutes before he managed to climb up onto an island in the middle of the pond.

When firefighters arrived they used an inflatable walkway to reach the island, and two members of the crew walked across to Milo.

They were then able to get a lead onto the dog and walked him back to safety, where he was reunited with his owner. He was cold and wet, but otherwise unhurt.

A spokesman for Avon Fire & Rescue Service said she wanted to remind people to take when outside during the cold weather.

She added: ‘Never venture onto frozen water. It may look solid but can break easily and anyone falling in will quickly feel the effects which could lead to hypothermia or worse.

‘Always dial 999 and ask for the fire and rescue service. We have the equipment and training to deal with incidents of this nature.’
