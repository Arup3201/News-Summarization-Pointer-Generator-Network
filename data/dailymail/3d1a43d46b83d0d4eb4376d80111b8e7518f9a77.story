A family is celebrating the birth of its first girl for 90 years.

Rubi Victoria Porter was born in Lincoln County Hospital on March 29 weighing 7lb 8oz.

Her parents, Rudi and Vicky Porter, of Newark, Notts, said they had decided not to ask the sex of their baby during scans, so the birth of a girl was a complete surprise.

Vicky, 27, said the midwife had passed the baby straight to her so she was the first to see they had a daughter.

'I was over the moon when I looked and saw I'd had a little girl,' she said.

Rudi, 29, said he had cried after the baby had arrived.

He said: 'After all this time of the family having only boys it came as a real shock that we had finally got a girl.'

The last girl before Rubi to be born into the family was the late Elizabeth Porter, who was born on January 2, 1922.

Her brother, Tom Porter, 82, is Rubi's great grandfather.

He and his wife, Betty Porter, 81, of have three sons - Chris Porter, Rubi's grandfather, 58, David Porter, 52, and Kevin Porter, 50.

Each of them had two sons. Chris,Porter is father to Rubi's father Rudi and Liam, 28.

David Porter's sons are William, 14, and Thomas, 11. Kevin Poter's sons are Harrison, 14, and Ben, 11.

Rubi's great grandmother, Betty Porter, said it was amazing that they had finally had a girl born into the family.

'I had given up hope. Everybody is thrilled that we've got a little girl.'

Rubi's grandmother, Lorraine Porter, said everyone thought the couple would probably have another boy.

Her mother, Margaret Pollard, had knitted cardigans in every colour just in case.

'Everyone was really surprised after all this time,' said Lorraine Porter. 'Rubi's really broken the mould.'
