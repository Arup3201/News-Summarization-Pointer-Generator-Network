A former leader in the Church of Scientology - who has since left the controversial church - claims that current leaders setup high-tech surveillance cameras to spy on him and his wife in their rural Texas home, according to a lawsuit the former leader's wife has filed in a Texas district court.

Monique Rathbun, the wife of former Scientology leader Marty Rathbun, claims church members - at the apparent directive of church leader David Miscavige - rented property near a home where the couple lives in order to spy on them.

According to the suit, filed in Comal County, Texas, church members 'harassed, insulted, surveilled, photographed, videotaped, defamed and humiliated' the couple.

The Leader: The Rathbuns hope they will be able to depose Scientology leader David Miscavige in person

One group of scientologists, known as 'squirrel busters,' were seen wearing t-shirts with Rathbun's face on them as they filmed the couple near their Texas home.

'The intent was to make our life a living hell and drive us out of our 
hometown, which succeeded. We moved to hill country, property surrounded
 by woods. They tracked down the owner of a 5-acre undeveloped property 
behind us and leased it and put what appeared to be camouflaged game 
cameras,' Marty Rathbun told Page Six. 

'But upon inspection they turned out to be high-tech human 
surveillance cameras — the same cameras used by the DEA and patrol on 
the Mexican border and now by drug dealers to counteract the DEA. They 
were camouflaged in cameras that appeared to be to alert hunters to the 
movement of deer.'

Controversy: Scientology is one of the more controversial religions in the world today, with many describing it as a 'cult'

Until 2004, Marty Rathbun was the 'inspector general' of Scientology's Religious Technology Center. But he and Miscavige had an apparent falling out, and he left the church.

His wife was never a member.

The couple now hopes to depose the church's leader, David Miscavige, which Scientology critic Tony Ortega says is likely going to happen.

On his blog, Underground Bunker, Ortega writes that Texas Judge Dib Waldrip 'has ordered the deposition of Miscavige with no restrictions.'

The church, Ortega writes, asked that Miscavige give his deposition in writing, a request Judge Waldrip evidently denied.

'The main thing is we get the time to do discovery,' the Rathbun's attorney, Ray Jeffrey, told Ortega. 'David Miscvaige is still in this lawsuit, and has to give his deposition.'

Ortega says that 'Miscavige
 had argued that he had nothing to do with the harassment campaign that 
Monique alleges made her life miserable over the past four years. 

And 
although one church entity, the Church of Scientology International, has
 admitted to running that campaign, Miscavige claims that he has nothing
 to do with CSI and instead only runs a different church entity, the 
Religious Technology Center (RTC), and should be let out of the lawsuit. 

Monique argues that he runs all aspects of Scientology, and she should 
have the ability to depose Miscavige before Judge Waldrip can make a 
decision about Miscavige’s request to be let out of the suit.'

The Church of Scientology has long been suspected of harassing its critics and leading campaigns to silence those who they feel are a threat to the religion.
