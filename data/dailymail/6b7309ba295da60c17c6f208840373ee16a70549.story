Tottenham are braced for offers to take Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, with West Bromwich Albion and Queens Park Rangers the likeliest bidders. 

Tony Pulis is determined to bring a striker to the Hawthorns and chairman Jermey Peace might countenance a large contribution to the Togo international’s £100,000 per week wages given the boost he would provide to the club’s survival hopes. 

The Baggies have already brought in Callum McManaman for an undisclosed fee but Adebayor would add real star quality to the squad.

Tony Pulis is determined to bring a striker to the Hawthorns but his wages could prove a problem

The former Arsenal and Manchester City striker has only played 15 times under Mauricio Pochettino this season, scoring just two goals during that time.

But the powerful forward would fit perfectly into Pulis's plans, providing they can convince him to leave the capital.

While Saido Berahino has netted 14 times in all competitions this season, the next highest scorer at the club is Victor Anichebe, who only has four.
