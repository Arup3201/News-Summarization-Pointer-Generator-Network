She is one of the world's top earning models and was even dubbed 'the next supermodel' by fearsome Anna Wintour.

And now Karolina Kurkova is proving the Vogue editor right in her latest fashion shoot for this week's edition of net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit.

Donning off-duty summer pieces by the likes of Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, Karolina showcases her natural beauty as she poses in the forest.

In an exclusive interview with the magazine, Karolina talks about the early stages of her career and how Anna Wintour hand-picked her for a photo shoot with fashion photographer and industry legend Steven Meisel.

'He said my smile was beautiful,' she recalled. 'So I started smiling!'.

Obviously she was doing something right- Wintour put one of the shots of the Czech model on the February 2001 issue of fashion bible Vogue and her career took off.

She has since been a clothes horse for 
the likes of Valentino, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and H&M and in the 
2002 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, she wore the 'Star of Victoria' 
Fantasy Bra, worth almost $10m (£6.4m).

'I know I’m lucky to do this work. I get
to express myself and work with creative people. So I don’t think of it
as work; its what I love,' she added.

She describes her personal style as 'simple, classic, chic, but with an edge.'

Speaking about her beauty regime, she said: 'Even if I don’t have time for anything else, I have to have lipstick.

'It makes me feel ready for the world.'

As a self-proclaimed 'smart shopper' who looks for flexibility, she says: 'I love a dress I can wear with flats for a play-date with me son, but then I can add a great pair of pumps, maybe a jacket, a cool piece of jewellery and I’m ready for a meeting.'

When it comes to her family, the model- who has a four-year-old son- looks for balance between work and family time.

She said: 'That’s always the first discussion at home. "Have we been traveling a lot? How much quality time as a family have we had?"

'As a mother, I’ve started to ask: why am I doing this job or that job? Do I believe in it? It has to be good for the family.'

Speaking about the future, Karolina, who is turning thirty this year and was ranked sixth on Forbes' annual top earning model list, said: 'The next phase of my life will be about building my brand.

'I need to find the right idea and the right team. It has to have integrity and I want to be part of the process.'
