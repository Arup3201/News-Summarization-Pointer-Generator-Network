Morten Storm joined radical Islamists in the Middle East before becoming a double agent for MI5

A former Jihadist who became an MI5 double agent has urged young British Muslims not to fight in the Middle East.

Morten Storm helped intelligence agencies after a 'crisis of faith' led him to turn his back on radical Islamists.

After coming into contact with some of Al Qaeda's most infamous figures, he has now sent out a message to any youngsters tempted to join the terrorists.

He told BBC's Newsbeat that he understands radical young men, saying: 'I know they are frustrated with our government and foreign policies. They don't see any justice.'

But he added: 'If they do go to Syria it will be a one way ticket and their lives will be totally different. They will be labelled and followed.'

Urging young British Muslims to stay at home, he added: 'Your family and children need you more.

'Those who come back are broken with traumas. Others will come back as fully-trained killing machines and are extremely dangerous to have in the UK.'

Storm, now 38, converted to Islam after spending time in prison and developing extreme jihadist views in London. He then moved to Yemen in 2001.

As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden.

But, in a new book, he reveals he turned his back on fundamentalists after he was prevented from travelling to fight in Somalia in 2006.

He was stunned that he had been denied what he considered his fate and looked up 'contradictions in the Koran' on the internet in frustration.

In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, broadcast last night, he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.'

He was later recruited by the CIA, MI5 and the Danish intelligence service, PET, as a double agent to inform on operations in Yemen and Somalia and prevent attacks in Europe.

His words of warning to would-be terrorists come amid growing fears about the number of British-born young men heading to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside radical groups like Isis (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant).

Earlier this month, Cardiff's Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan and Aberdeen's Abdul Rakib Amin appeared in a 'recruitment video' in which they urged their 'brothers' to join them.

Around 500 British men are thought to have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremist militias, with some now spilling over the border to join the groups now terrorising Iraq.

It is believed tracking the men when they return to the UK and attempting to foil any terror attacks on British soil are now MI5's top priorities.
