Kevin Nolan has a right to feel more than a touch aggrieved. No other Englishman has played more Premier League games than he has without winning an international cap. 

It's 375 and counting for the West Ham skipper who - at the age of 32 - must feel his race has been run in the hunt for a call from Roy Hodgson.

A stalwart of the top flight since Bolton's promotion in 2001, Nolan has been overlooked by four England managers - Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Hodgson.

Kevin Nolan is the Englishman with the most Premier League appearances without an international cap

Nolan (pictured here playing for Bolton Wanderers) has played 375 games in the top flight to date 

Tony Hibbert (pictured playing against Lille last week) has never been called up by England 

Joey Barton (right, shaking Frank Lampard's hand) made one substitute appearance against Spain in 2007

Everton midfielder Leon Osman has also played for the Three Lions over in Stockholm against Sweden

Kevin Nolan (Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham) - 375 Premier League games

Chris Perry (Wimbledon, Tottenham, Charlton) - 363 games

Steve Watson (Newcastle, Everton, Aston Villa, West Brom) - 351 games

Jason Dodd (Southampton) - 329 games

Kevin Campbell (Arsenal, Everton, Nottingham Forest, West Brom) - 325 games

Matt Taylor (Portsmouth, Bolton, West Ham, Burnley) - 318 games

Peter Atherton (Coventry, Sheffield Wed, Bradford) - 318 games

Alan Wright (Blackburn, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United) - 305 games

Garry Flitcroft (Manchester City, Blackburn) - 301 games 

Tony Hibbert (Everton) - 262 games 

In that time he's watch Joey Barton, David Dunn and Leon Osman all get the nod.

And there is quite a number of English players - researched bybwin - who have spent the majority of their careers in the top division but never earned any recognition. 

With the malaise that constantly surrounds England, that takes quite some doing.

Unsurprisingly, Tony Hibbert makes the top 10 for Premier League appearances without a cap. The Everton right back has played 262 times for the Toffees, while Steve Watson - who was at Goodison Park for five years - made 351 overall.

Chris Perry, a former central defender for Tottenham, Wimbledon and Charlton, is second in the list behind Nolan on 363. 

Perhaps the unluckiest man on the list is Kevin Campbell. 

The former Arsenal and Everton striker appeared to have been born in the wrong era - one in which England were blessed with real quality up front. 

Despite scoring more than 100 top flight goals he never got a look in with Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright and Co all ahead of him.

Jason Dodd (left, battling with Andy Cole) spent a total of 16 years at Southampton 

Burnley's Matt Taylor (celebrating while at West Ham in February) is another to make the list 

Peter Atherton (left, for Bradford City) and Blackburn Rovers'  Garry Flitcroft played more than 300 games

Former Southampton full back and skipper Jason Dodd recorded 329 appearances, while Matt Taylor - still playing at Burnley - has 318 to date without a cap. Ex-Bradford, Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry utility man Peter Atherton is joint-sixth with 318 as well.

Alan Wright, for so long a dependable servant at left back for Aston Villa, ended up on 305 games without a cap when he retired and central midfielder Garry Flitcroft finished with four fewer.
