A mother-of-one has told of how a huge shark 'stalked' her family at Cheynes Beach, only days before 17-year-old Jay Muscat was killed while spearfishing in the water.

Rhianna Hook, from Mount Barker near the south coast of Western Australia, said she was forced to pluck the four children she was with out of the ocean, including her two year old daughter Tali, upon seeing the grey shape at the beach, which is 60 kilometres east of Albany, on Boxing Day.

'We thought we'd let the kids have a play in the ocean and then one of the boys with us who was fishing, said there was something there, so we all jumped out,' Mrs Hook said.

'We saw all this thrashing around in front of us and we thought it might be a dolphin and didn't think anything of it, but then one of the boys said "that's a shark" and that's when we realised.

'You could tell by the way the tail was moving – dolphins' tails go up and down and sharks go side to side. It was also very big; well over two metres long and it looked a bit menacing.' 

The 33-year-old spent the day fishing and swimming with her family at the West Australian beach, 60 kilometres east of Albany, when she saw the huge figure less than 100 metres from the shore line 

The sighting came only three days before the death of 17-year-old Jay Muscat, who was spearfishing when he was attacked by a shark at the remote beach 

The 33-year-old school teacher told Daily Mail Australia that the shape was less than 100 metres off the shore of the shallow beach.

It came only three days before Jay Muscat, 17, died at the beach while spearfishing with his friend Matt Pullella, who shot his spear gun into the mouth of the shark to save his own life after it had mauled his friend. 

Western Australia's Department of Fisheries confirmed on Tuesday that capture gear and baited drum lines were deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark, which was likely to be a four to five-metre-long great white.

The Beach remained closed on Tuesday and the department urged locals and holiday makers to stay out of the water.

Mrs Hook took to social media after her sighting, to share a picture of the shark, writing that it 'stalked our family up and down the beach'.

Mrs Hook admitted she felt guilty after not reporting the sighting to the Department of Fisheries, later adding that she knew the shop that Mr Muscat's family owned 

'We think it was trying to chase some food,' she said.

'It swam up the channel, up the beach, then turned around and came back again and once it got back it stayed in front of us for a while, then it went into a patch of weed and disappeared.'

'We had my nine-year-old niece, a five-year-old niece, a four-year-old and my two and a half year old with us and we just went 'no way, you guys can stay in the creek'.'

Despite the frightening incident occurring at the location that Mrs Hook and her family choose to visit over Easter and on Boxing Day each year, the mother admitted she felt guilty after not reporting the sighting to the Department of Fisheries.

'We saw all this splashing around in front of us... You could tell by the way the tail was moving – dolphins' tails go up and down and sharks go side to side. It was also very big; well over two metres long and it looked a bit menacing,' Mrs Hook said of her shark sighting 

'We visit every so often but I wouldn't have had a clue who to report it to,' she said.

'We've seen dolphins and whales there before and my husband saw wobbegong sharks when he was younger – bit closer to the actual beach, but I've never seen anything close to a shark in the water there before, so when we saw it we were all thinking it was amazing without thinking anything about it.

'Having the tragedy happen has made us all kind of think, well maybe we should have reported it.' 

'They [Mr Muscat's family] are from a small town close to Albany where we do our shopping – we know the shop that his family owned and I work at a school and know kids who know him.

'It's a hugely awful tragedy, gut wrenching for everyone,' she added.
