Are we alone in the universe?

Until now, scientists have thought that our own Earth is the only planet that can support life.

But now scientists at Ohio State University who have been studying our 'solar twins' - stars that have solar systems with planets - say they could be even MORE habitable than Earth.

Our solar system: other stars could be like our sun and have planets that could support life

Geologists and astronomers at Ohio State University have teamed up to search for alien life in a new way.

They looked for the radioactive elements of thorium and uranium.

More of those elements make the inside of the planet warmer.

That in turn drives the plate tectonics, or how the separate parts of the earth's crust move.

Earthquakes are the result of the different plates of the earth's crust moving and grinding against each other.

Plate tectonics helps maintain water on the surface of the Earth, so the existence of plate tectonics is sometimes taken as an indicator of a planet’s hospitality to life.

Our Sun is a star - our closest star. Earth is about 150million kilometres from the Sun.

Of the eight solar twins the Ohio State University researchers have studied so far, seven appear to contain much more thorium than our sun — which suggests that any planets orbiting those stars probably contain more thorium, too. 

That means that the interior of those planets are probably warmer than ours.

Our own Earth inhabits the 'Goldilocks zone' - a region of space where the planet is just the right distance from its home star.

In this habitable zone, the planet is neither too hot nor too cold: it is just right.

Our Sun is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields.

Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth.

Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium.

The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago.

Life is only possible in a small zone around the Sun - the 'habitable zone' or the 'Goldilocks zone'.

The Ohio State researchers believe that if the planets around the solar twins are warmer than they thought, then we could increase the size of those stars' Goldilocks zones - and make more planets in those distant solar systems more friendly to life.

'If it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought, then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star, and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life,' said Cayman Unterborn, who presented the results at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco this week.
