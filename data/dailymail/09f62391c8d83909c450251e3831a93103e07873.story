Laughter heals all wounds, but it seems even a funny video wont be enough to get the public to forgive Lance Armstrong for his years of cheating and lying.

The disgraced former cycler appears in a video posted to Outside magazine's website Tuesday, showing bike enthusiasts how to change a flat tire.

At the beginning of the video, Armstrong introduces himself as a seven-time winner of the Tour de France. But when that title appears on the 
screen, a big asterisk flashes up, noting that Armstrong was stripped of
 the seven titles for doping.

'Hey, I didn't write the script,' Armstrong shrugs.

Infamous athlete: Lance Armstrong appears in a new video on Outside magazine's website, in which he explains how to change a flat bike tire

Too soon: Armstrong makes light of his cycling scandal in the video, but many in the biking community did not find the joke funny

Armstrong goes on to explain how to change a tire, removing the punctured tube and replacing it with a new one, all the while acting the part of a likeable blue-collar guy.

While Armstrong seems friendly enough in the video, some in the biking community aren't buying it and are still far away from forgiving Armstrong for his years of cheating.

'Don't watch Lance Armstrong's How to fix a flat video - he's an attention seeing ex-doper,' Bike Radar's Sam Dansie wrote.

Armstrong has largely been out of the spotlight since fessing up to using performance-enhancing drugs in a interview with Oprah Winfrey more than a year ago.

Revelations: The new video comes just a week after documents were released, revealing that Armstrong's coach knew about the doping when he chose him to compete in the 1996 Olympics. Armstrong pictured competing in the 1999 Tour de France

Recently, Armstrong has been in the headlines again after documents were released Wednesday, listing all of the people Armstrong told about his drug use.

The most shocking name on the list was former U.S. Olympic team coach Chris Carmichael.

Armstrong admitted to authorities that he told Carmichael about his use of PEDs in 1995, and if true that means Carmichael knew Armstrong was cheating when he chose him to compete on the 1996 Olympic team.

Carmichael denied knowing about the doping in a statement to the Colorago Springs Gazette last Friday, saying: 'I have never participated in a doping program, not with Lance Armstrong or anyone else. My role as a coach has always been to inspire athletes to be the best they can be by focusing on training, nutrition and innovations in equipment and sports science.'
