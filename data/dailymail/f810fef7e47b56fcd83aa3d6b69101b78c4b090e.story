At the heart of Arsenal’s defence, Calum Chambers played as if he owned the place. This was a performance of breathtaking maturity.

To watch an Englishman as composed as Chambers on the ball, dropping off those extra 10 yards to be in possession or striding forward through midfield is something special. Long may it continue.

Even with Fraizer Campbell breathing down his neck, he was always a step ahead of the game.

Arsenal came from behind to win on the opening day for the third time — no other side has done so more often in Premier League history. 

The way he reads situations is remarkable for his age, showing far more composure in Arsenal’s defence than his experienced team-mate Laurent Koscielny.

Think of the great ball-playing English centre backs, from Bobby Moore to Rio Ferdinand. This 19-year-old has similar traits. This is a future England defender. Last season he played right back but he was identified as a centre back as he came through Southampton’s academy.

Wenger, to his credit, will always be remembered as the manager who had the conviction to make the change. It is a good decision.

Chambers has already grown into the Arsenal shirt — enjoying life at the club and progressing at a remarkable pace.

‘Calum has come in and surprised everyone already,’ said left back Kieran Gibbs. ‘During the season we don’t get to watch other players much, so I didn’t know too much about him.’

Faith: Arsene Wenger was more than willing to throw Chambers into the team straight away

Trophy cabinet: Chambers helped Arsenal to victory in the FA Community Shield last weekend 

He excelled in the Community Shield the previous weekend, part of an Arsenal team who beat the champions 3-0 on the grandest stage of all.

Soon enough, when Chambers is called into the England squad, Wembley will be his home on the international stage.

On Tuesday, he will be in Europe, playing in a Champions League qualifier against Besiktas at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul.

On Monday morning, when Arsenal train before they travel to Turkey, Wenger must decide whether to take World Cup-winning defender Per Mertesacker.

Although Mertesacker has only just returned to training after a break following Germany’s triumph, Wenger is tempted to turn to experience against Slaven Bilic’s side.

Experience: Wenger may prefer German World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker to Chambers for Tuesday night's Champions League play-off with Besiktas in Istanbul 

Rest: Mertesacker was given time off to recover after Germany won the World Cup out in Brazil 

This is a demanding week for Arsenal, who face a four-hour flight to Turkey and will return in the small hours of Wednesday morning in order to prepare for Saturday’s trip to Everton.

Arsenal were ordinary on Saturday, but they were faced with unusual circumstances after Palace manager Tony Pulis left the club 48 hours before the start of the season.

It will take time for Alexis Sanchez to gel with his team-mates and he should be granted it. He was welcomed to the league with some fierce challenges from Palace captain Mile Jedinak and his midfield partner Joe Ledley.

Arsenal are still bedding in, scrambling a result after they fell behind to a clever corner routine that ended when Brede Hangeland flicked a header beyond Wojciech Szczesny.

Level terms: Laurent Koscielny got in behind the Palace defence to equalise for Arsenal on half-time

Arsenal recovered when Koscielny equalised just before half-time and Aaron Ramsey struck Arsenal’s winner.

It was tough on Palace, but the priority is to find a manager before Saturday’s clash with West Ham at Selhurst Park.

Although chairman Steve Parish is considering Tim Sherwood and Malky Mackay for the role, he has been advised to hire a manager with some serious Premier League experience.

He held a mini board meeting with fellow directors before the game and they will explore a number of options this week.

The timing of Pulis’s exit came as a shock to the players after a tough pre-season schedule in Austria, the USA and Germany.

Keeper Julian Speroni said: ‘As professionals we need to deal with it and move on. Tony was very good for us and we learned a lot with him. We’re sad to see him go this way, but the players have learned a lot from last season.

‘The education he gave us will make us stronger.’
