France defender Mamadou Sakho and his teammates will be filled with 'rage' when they take on Germany in their World Cup quarter-final.

Not because they have anything personal against the Germans, but because they are still feeling the anger and desperation after barely qualifying for the tournament in Brazil.

Sakho has been France's vice captain since the second leg of the World Cup playoffs against Ukraine. With the team trailing 2-0 after a dire performance in Kiev, Sakho scored in a 3-0 win, and his passionate performance sparked a remarkable turnaround.

Since then, France is unbeaten in eight games and has kept six clean sheets.

'Of
 course I still have the rage inside me from that game,' the Liverpool 
defender said Wednesday. 'We all have a little bit of that rage inside 
of us.'

France is vastly 
more inexperienced than Germany, which has reached at least the 
semifinals of each major competition since the 2008 European 
Championship. By contrast, France is rebuilding and has not reached any 
semifinal since the 2006 World Cup.

But several fresh talents have revamped the national team - which only has two regular starters older than 29.

'We're
 a very young team with new players,' Sakho said. 'We've instilled a new
 spirit into the team - off the pitch, first of all - and it reflects on
 the pitch.

'We know that Germany is a big team, a big football nation,' Sakho added. 'But we're also very good and I believe in us.'

At
 24 years old, Sakho is the oldest of France's new generation and has 
played 22 times for his country. He was rested against Nigeria after 
failing to shake of a left hamstring injury but is fit again to face 
Germany on Friday at Maracana Stadium.

Besides
 Sakho, Paul Pogba has established himself in midfield and Raphael 
Varane has done likewise in central defense. Meanwhile, Antoine 
Griezmann has confidently replaced winger Franck Ribery, who was injured
 before the tournament. Â

The 33-year-old Evra and 31-year-old Bacary Sagna are the senior players.

But unlike before, all the players mingle and there is no generational conflict within the squad.

'Everyone
 sits together at the dinner table, there's no difference,' Sakho said. 
'After the meal last night eight of us stayed at the table to talk about
 football and about life in general. It was brilliant.'

Some
 change from Euro 2012, when players formed cliques and went straight to
 their rooms after finishing their meals. It was even worse at the 2010 
World Cup, where they were united - but only because they went on strike
 and refused to train after one of their teammates was sent home.

'I
 wasn't part of the old generation, but we really sense that this team 
gets on,' Sakho said. 'If you have strong characters things can blow 
apart when you're together for one month. We have strong characters in 
this team but we're able to control it.'

Pogba
 scored his first goal of the tournament in Monday's 2-0 win over 
Nigeria in the second round, and he's also been making an impression 
behind the scenes.

'Paul 
really gets the atmosphere going. Last night he stuck some music on and 
he was dancing all on his own,' Sakho said. 'Everyone was watching him 
and it was really funny.'
