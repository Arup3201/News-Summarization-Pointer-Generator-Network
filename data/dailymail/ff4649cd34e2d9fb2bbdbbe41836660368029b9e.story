A viola player who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs during the live final of Britain's Got Talent last night has apologised, admitting her actions were 'silly'.

The musician, who jumped to the front of the stage as brothers Richard and Adam were performing, appeared on the talent show in 2012, along with her band Raven Quartet.

Natalie - a BAFTA-nominated composer who appeared in the closing ceremony of last summer's Olympics - was performing as a backing musician for the duo, and has subsequently apologised for her actions.

Apology: Her boyfriend Chris Waitt said Miss Holt had been 'pressured' to say sorry publically after the incident

Protest: Miss Holt was grinning and laughing as she threw the eggs at the judges

In a statement released by the show 
she said: 'I want to apologise to Richard and Adam for overshadowing 
their performance. I’ve never done anything like this before and in 
hindsight I have realised it was a silly thing to do.'

While it is not clear why Natalie decided to throw eggs at the judges, her band mates have insisted that they were not involved.

A tweet from the group feed read: 
'Just to clarify…. The other 3 of us were working elsewhere today and 
found out when you did.' 

Disgruntled: Natalie Holt, pictured with Matt LeBlanc has been named as the woman who egged Simon Cowell on stage on Saturday night's Britain's Got Talent final

Quick change of heart: Shortly after the end of the show Natalie apologised for her actions

A spokesman for the show told 
MailOnline: 'During tonight’s show an incident took place during the 
finale of Richard and Adam’s performance.

'Natalie Holt (age 30) was part
 of the backing group for their performance and as a result of her 
misguided actions the police were called. However, we have decided to 
take no further action at this stage.'

Judge Amanda Holden spoke of her anger at the disruption Natalie's appearance on stage caused and she  branded her 'a stupid cow' for the apparent act of protest.

Simon had to remove his jacket and was left with yolk on his shirt following the attack, but he didn't seem too fazed.

Although the egging occurred in the middle of their performance, Richard and Adam were not put off and 
they were later praised for their professional attitude.

Simon said he thought the woman was throwing sandwiches and assumed it was part of the performance.

He said: 'I thought it was part of the act, I thought they were throwing sandwiches.'

Disabled comedian Jack Carroll was the next act to perform on stage and he used the opportunity to make a joke about the situation.

He began: 'Can I just say, I was going to run on and throw some eggs, so thanks for ruining that.'

Angry: Amanda Holden was less than impressed with the stunt during the final of Britain's Got Talent

Natalie appeared on Britain's Got Talent last year with her band Raven Quartet.

It seems that Natalie, a 
BAFTA-nominated composer, and her band mates didn't have a positive 
experience on the talent show last year.

Natalie's band mate Rachael Lander 
wrote a scathing blog post about the group's experience on the show, 
which has since been taken down.

In the piece she wrote: 'Honestly, if
 you think watching those talent shows is gut wrenching, you should try 
being a contestant in one.'

Target: Miss Holt picked out Simon Cowell as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry

It's no yolk: Simon had to remove his jacket after it was hit but he still had some egg on his shirt

Rachael claimed the group were approached by the show and deliberated over whether to audition.

She wrote: 'We had to acknowledge the
 grim truth, which was that Raven needed a bigger profile to get any 
kind of deal, we could get a load more gigs if we played to 15 million 
viewers, even if those viewers were of the opinion that a dog with a 
hula hoop constituted entertainment gold.'

Another extract for the post reads: 
'We were uncomfortable that we were, by entering, complicit with the 
exploitation of the vulnerable to be humiliated in front of millions. 
But we had made ourselves publicity whores, we’d made our bed, we had to
 play.'

Piers Morgan tweeted: 'My vote goes to the egg-thrower. #BGT.'

However the broadcaster read Natalie's last tweet, dated from December, which read: 'Thinking about starting a petition to stop Piers Morgan being sent back over.....,' and soon changed his mind.

He wrote: 'If the egg-thrower was @filmmusicholt as Twitter claims, then after seeing her last tweet, I'm withdrawing my vote! #BGT.'

Nothing to do with us: Natalie's band distanced themselves from the musician and said they were did not know what had happened
