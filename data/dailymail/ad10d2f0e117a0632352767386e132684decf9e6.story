Mana Lumm, 20, was last seen at the facility about 12.30am on Sunday morning where he was jailed for a sexual-related offence

A dangerous sex-offender is on the run after escaping from a correctional facility in central Victoria.

Mana Lumm, 20, was last seen at the facility about 12.30am on Sunday morning where he was jailed for a sexual-related offence.

Police have searched the immediate area around the facility but Lumm is yet to be located.

The 20-year-old is Caucasian, about 175cm tall with a solid build, brown eyes and brown hair.

A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia he could not reveal the area where the facility was located for legal reasons.

He would not elaborate on what those legal reasons were.

Anyone who sees Lumm is urged by police not to approach him and phone triple zero if he is spotted.

Police arrested a child rapist who escaped from prison earlier this month in a separate incident near Ballarat in central Victoria.

The man, who could not be identified by court order, escaped from the Corella Place correctional facility shortly after 2.30am on Sunday July 6.

Corella Place - nicknamed the 'Village of the Damned' - is a village-style complex which houses child sex offenders and rapists who have finished serving their prison sentences but are considered unacceptable risks to the community.

The facility is not surrounded by walls but the offenders are monitored with GPS ankle bracelets and cannot leave without permission.
