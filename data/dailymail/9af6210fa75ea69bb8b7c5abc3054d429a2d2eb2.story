Peterson was one of the multi-level marketing company's top salesmen. He was a member of the 'Founders Circle' of top salesmen and had been named Herbalife's top distributor of the year 10 times.

Last year, it was estimated that he made $3million.

In a promotional video for the company, Peterson boasted about his cattle ranch in Wyoming, private beach club in Mexico, in addition to homes in Colorado and Brazil.

Peterson was able to do so well became he got into the company at the beginning, in the early 1980s.

Many have accused Herbalife of being a pyramid scheme - a non-sustainable business model focused on creating more salespeople than sales.

Peterson and his ex-wife Susan profited from the system by using an internet lead-generation business which is now banned in the company.

Work from Home Inc. was started in 2002 and recruited Herbalife salespeople, causing hundreds of consumer compaints to the Federal Trade Commission.

Last April Herbalife announced that distributors would be banned from buying and selling leads as of June 30.

The couple were also one of the first to bring Herbalife to Mexico, which has turned into one of the company's biggest markets.

But his immense success may have been his downfall. In the video he talks about being goal-oriented to achieve your dreams.

'I've always had another goal, another dream, a reason to keep going,' he said.

Peterson is survived by his three children and second-wife Fernanda.
