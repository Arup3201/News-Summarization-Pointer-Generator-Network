A high school student has died after a friend moved a hunting rifle in the back of his truck and the gun accidentally went off, shooting the teen dead.

Jaden Rahm, 16, was driving three school friends to get lunch at one of their houses in Yuma, Colorado on Monday when the boy in the seat behind him moved the gun used for duck hunting.

The rifle went off and the round went through the driver's seat, hitting Rahm in the torso, Sheriff Chad Day told the Denver Channel.

Yuma Police received a call about the shooting at 11.58am just south of Yuma High School's campus. The sheriff's office announced his death that afternoon. 

Tragic: Jayden Rahm, 16, was accidentally shot dead when a friend moved a gun in his car as they headed for lunch on Monday. He was driving his parents' car and the gun was used for bird hunting

Star: The 16-year-old sophomore was remembered by friends as a great athlete and a gentleman

Authorities said the three other teenagers in the car at the time are not considered suspects. No one else was injured.

Sheriff Day told the Denver Channel that it's common for people to leave their guns in their trucks during hunting season. Jaden had been driving his family's work truck at the time.

'There is still some forensic evidence that needs to be processed and an autopsy needs to be performed, but evidence points to this being a tragic accident,' the department said in a statement.

It is unlikely any charges will be filed, they said. 

Rahm, a sophomore, played varsity baseball and hoped to be a farmer.

On Monday night, a large crowd gathered for a candlelit vigil and remembered the teenager as a gentleman and someone who always tried to cheer people up.

'He was the one who brought us all together,' Kyli Blach, a sophomore, said. 'His blue eyes would sparkle and you'd have to smile, he would almost force you to smile.' 

Counseling services are being offered to students and families at the school.

Friends and classmates posted the initials 'JR' across their social media pages to pay tribute to the young student. 

The Yuma County Sheriff's Office said the boy's family does not wish to make a statement.
