NICE is considering recommending that patients and staff are banned from smoking in hospital grounds

Staff, patients and relatives should all be banned from smoking in the grounds of hospitals, according to new guidance from the NHS  watchdog.

The ‘no concessions’ policy on smoking would see the removal of 
smoking shelters from hospital grounds.

Staff should also be disciplined if 
they smoke at work or at any other time when they
could be identified as an NHS employee, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance says.

The organisation is considering the draft recommendations in an attempt to encourage hospital bosses to put an end to the sight of patients in hospital gowns smoking outside medical centres.

The guidance, which will not be compulsory, also suggests that patients who wish to smoke should be given nicotine 
patches and gum and informed in writing that smoking at the hospital is banned.

Relatives of patients wishing to smoke they should be sold nicotine replacement in hospital shops to discourage them.

Until now NICE recommended that the NHS should ‘seek to promote not smoking as the norm’.

NICE is also encouraging hospitals to provide patients with information on the dangers of smoking.

This will include advising them not to smoke near other patients, pregnant women, women with children or while at home or in a car.

Hospitals will also be told to offer people who want to stop smoking a referral to a stop smoking adviser.

Mike Kelly, director of the NICE Centre for Public Health, said: ‘The benefits of stopping smoking are well known, and people are already required by law not to smoke inside enclosed or mostly enclosed buildings.

‘This draft guidance sets out 
proposals on supporting people in a hospital environment not to smoke, 
as well as supporting the smoke-free policies in hospitals. 

The watchdog also says that hospitals should deal with patients who wish to smoke by giving them nicotine patches and gum

‘Secondary care providers have a responsibility to protect the health of people who use or work in their services.

‘The draft recommendations propose that this duty of care should also cover providing advice on how to improve health, including stop smoking interventions.’

The draft proposals will now be the subject of a two month consultation.

Treating smoking-related illnesses is estimated to cost the NHS £2.7 billion each year.

Smoking is the main cause of preventable illness and premature death in England.

A wide range of diseases and conditions are caused by smoking, including cancers, respiratory diseases, heart and other circulatory diseases.
