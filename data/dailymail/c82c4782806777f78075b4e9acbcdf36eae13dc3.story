Amaon’s busiest ever day in the UK allowed it to report better than expected results on Wall Street last night.

The rising popularity in Britain of Black Friday – when retailers slash prices to kickstart Christmas shopping – helped the internet giant to fourth quarter profits of £393million, while net sales jumped 15 per cent.

Net sales for the full year were up 20 per cent to £59billion.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, hailed the company's success, saying its prime one-day delivery service had helped drive sales and was 'the best bargain in the history of shopping'

Black Friday, November 28, saw more than 5.5million items sold at a rate of 64 items a second on Amazon’s website. 

Sales peaked at 8.29am and the most popular deals snapped up by British customers included the Kindle Fire HDX 7in range – with savings of up to £100 – and the Dolce Gusto Mini Me Coffee Capsule Machine.

Diamond jewellery and men’s watches also proved popular.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder and CEO, said its Prime membership scheme, which includes unlimited one-day deliveries, was ‘the best bargain in the history of shopping’.

On Black Friday the web retailer sold 64 items per second, with Kindles proving popular, helping to drive profits for last year up 20 per cent to £56billion

Fellow web giant Google disappointed investors last night by failing to meet forecasts.

It still posted full year sales up 19 per cent to £44billion but blamed the strong dollar for weaker fourth quarter sales. The search engine said supply problems with its Nexus 7 tablet also hit its results.

Google also reported a 3 per cent decline in cost-per-click – the amount it can charge for adverts.
