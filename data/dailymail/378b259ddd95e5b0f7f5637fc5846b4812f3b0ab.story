Fresh-faced: Phillip Schofield has revealed details of his wilder 'partying' days when he was a children's presenter for the BBC in the 1980s

He is the smooth-talking television host, whose squeaky-clean reputation has made him a housewives’ favourite.

But Phillip Schofield has now hinted for the first time that he dabbled with drugs and has revealed his days of wild partying while working as a children’s presenter for the BBC in the 1980s.

The 51-year-old This Morning presenter has claimed he was a ‘lad’ and admitted his frustration at having to curb his wild behaviour as a young man and act ‘like the son of Enid Blyton’ while appearing on Children’s BBC, and later the Saturday morning show, Going Live!

Interviewed by his This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby for fashion magazine, Hunger, Schofield was asked how he had managed to hide his ‘dark side’ so well.

He replied: ‘It wasn’t a case of hiding it. I did the same as everybody else. I was a lad; we partied a bit, but I didn’t hide anything. It’s just that nobody bothered to look in the right place.

‘You have to remember that doing kids TV then, you were expected to be the son of Enid Blyton, and that was very difficult.

‘Now you can be much more open, and have a proper life. But then, it was almost, “Oh, you’ve got a girlfriend. What type of girl is she?” But my mates and I very quickly realised: don’t go in to central London and have a wild time.

‘By the way, when I say partying, my weakness has always been booze. I never got much into drugs, because I wasn’t very good at it.

‘We were simply getting leathered in Chiswick where we lived at the time. Everybody knew us and nobody was bothered, and nobody would tell. So I got away with it.’

Frustrated: Schofield admitted that as a young presenter he felt pressure to act 'like the son of Enid Blyton'

'Lad': Squeaky clean presenter Phillip Schofield admits he used to go and get 'leathered in Chiswick' with friends

Asked if he had deliberately tried to
portray a ‘whiter than white’ image, he told his co-host: ‘Let me ask 
you this: when you met me, you had your preconceived ideas; now you know
me, what do you think?’

Recalling one incident from his 
youth, he says that he and a friend spontaneously jetted off to watch 
the Berlin Wall being brought down following a drunken lunch in London, 
and ended up having dinner with two German prostitutes.

‘We ended up drinking vodka, eating 
caviar with a couple of East German hookers,’ he said. ‘We got in the 
car and we drove through Checkpoint Charlie with these two East German 
hookers, no questions asked. God knows what the children’s television 
would have thought!’

Last year, he surprised his two 
million Twitter followers by admitting he had chewed cocoa leaves - 
which are the raw material for cocaine - during a holiday in Peru.

Phillip Schofield, who now has two 
children with BBC production assistant Stephanie Lowe, joined the BBC in
September 1985 when he was 23.

He was famously the countinuity 
announcer for children’s television on the BBC, presenting from what was
described asthe ‘Broom Cupboard’ until 1987 with his puppet sidekick 
Gordon the Gopher. His guests included Bruce Forsyth and Tom Jones.

He then left to joined the BBC’s Saturday morning children’s show Going Live! alongside Sarah Greene until 1993.

He has always maintained a flawless 
reputation, and has since gone on to present adult programmes, including
Talking Telephone Numbers. He currently hosts four programmes on ITV, 
This Morning, Dancing on Ice, All Star Mr & Mrs and The Cube.

However, he has now revealed that he 
dislikes the spotless reputation that he has with viewers, suggesting he
has a volatile temper, often using Twitter to hit back at his critics.

‘The thing is, I inadvertently chip 
away at this image that I appear to have,’ he said. ‘But, like everyone 
else, I have opinions, and I do have a temper.

‘There’s nothing that winds me up 
more on Twitter than people who are stupid, and who say the most 
ridiculous things. And you have to be very diplomatic.

‘You have stopped me in the past and 
said, “don’t swear because all you’re going to do is play their game,” 
but what I do is follow them, and send them a direct message saying 
something that Phillip Schofield would never say! And then I unfollow 
them, watch their outrage and block them.

‘I have another secret Twitter 
account. Because once you block someone, you can’t see what they’re 
saying. I have a secret account so that I can leave it a day or so, and 
then occasionally go back and have a look and see if they’re still 
furious!’
