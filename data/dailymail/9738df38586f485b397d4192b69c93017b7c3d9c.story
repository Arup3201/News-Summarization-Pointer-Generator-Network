Nearly a million tickets were sold last month for the World Cup and the phenomenal demand means England fans face disappointing news when ballot results are revealed on Friday.

Despite high ticket prices, the hosts’ Pool A match against Australia at Twickenham drew 650,000 applications during the general sale period. Given that only around a quarter of the stadium’s 82,000 seats were available, approximately three per cent of applicants will be successful.

Public appetite to watch England means the encounter with Wales is also massively over-subscribed, as is the tournament final next October 31, which attracted 500,000 applications. Other games which generated greatest demand are holders New Zealand against Argentina at Wembley on the opening weekend, Australia v Wales and both semi-finals.

In all, 950,000 tickets have been allocated through the general sale, on top of the 340,000 which were sold through rugby clubs earlier this year. Supporter tour packages are on course to break records and hospitality boxes have sold out at Twickenham, Exeter and Brighton.

Debbie Jevans, chief executive of organisers England Rugby 2015, said: ‘We are thrilled with demand a year out from the tournament and the record level of demand we saw in September is a terrific indicator of the general interest and excitement for World Cup 2015. Demand has exceeded supply for a high number of matches and the only down-side is that there will inevitably be some disappointment.

‘Anyone who missed out on tickets this time will get first priority when the remaining tickets go back on sale next month.’

Of course, the task now will be to drive sales for the less-coveted matches. There are understood to be plenty of tickets left for many games at the Millennium Stadium and for the fixtures in Leeds, Leicester, Birmingham and Newcastle. But the bandwagon is well and truly rolling and that will take the pressure off organisers in terms of their financial obligations.

This World Cup will balance the books after the last tournament in New Zealand generated limited revenue. England won the hosting rights largely on the basis of their ability to generate substantial profit to meet the £80million guarantee payment to the IRB and end up with some change in the bank. That target is seemingly in hand.

The strong sales represent a giant leap towards the overall goal of shifting 2.3million tickets through all channels worldwide. They demonstrate a heartening interest in the game in this country and provide another example of the British support for major sports events, as was the case at the 2012 Olympics and the Commonwealth Games this year.

New Zealand lifted the trophy in 2011, and as the right-hand graphic shows there are millions who want to see the 2015 tournament 

While those involved with marketing and sales drive must maintain the momentum, the next challenge is looming — one of a logistical variety. England face Samoa next month at Twickenham in a Test which kicks off at 7pm. It will be used as a practice run for the night games which will be taking place at HQ next year.

Experience suggests there will be gridlock on the roads and long queues to catch the last trains back into the capital or out to the south and west. Yet there were fears that London would grind to a halt during the Olympics and they proved unfounded. Perhaps a few scare stories in the build-up and some strategic road closures on match-days might have the same liberating effect.

Sam Burgess will belatedly arrive at Bath next week armed with yet another accolade. The 25-year-old was in Brisbane on Thursday to collect his award as the Rugby League International Federation’s world Player of the Year, the first Englishman to receive the prestigious prize.

‘It’s unexpected really,’ said the Yorkshireman, who is recovering from surgery after fracturing a cheekbone and eye socket during South Sydney Rabbitohs’ NRL Grand Final triumph.

‘I wasn’t supposed to be in the country. I was supposed to be out of here a couple of weeks ago.’ Instead, Burgess was on hand to present England shirts to four uncapped players ahead of their Four Nations clash with Samoa on Saturday.

One of the newcomers, Hull’s Joe Westerman, said: ‘He’s always been an awesome player. It was a bit emotional for him. He wishes he was out there playing with us.’ Bath and — eventually — England will hope he soon proves as inspirational in union.

Australia have provided a soap opera this year and there is every chance the drama will go on now Michael Cheika has been put in charge. He has a strong record with Leinster and the New South Wales Waratahs, but he is also highly volatile.

In March, he was given a suspended six-month ban by Super Rugby’s governing body for abusing a cameraman in South Africa. The judicial officer noted: ‘The propensity of Mr Cheika to behave in this manner is disturbing.’

He also broke a glass door at Canberra Stadium this year, was warned about his conduct by SANZAR last year and was fined after his Stade Francais side lost the 2011 Amlin Challenge Cup Final. On that occasion, he told Harlequins coach Tony Diprose: ‘Get out of the ****ing way, you ****ing moron.’ Cheika will have to behave at least until the end of next August, or his suspended ban would kick in just in time for the World Cup.

Quote of the week — ‘He’s a mercenary, there’s no question about that, but he’s a terribly gifted sportsman. While we might not all agree with the New Zealand Rugby Union letting him come and go as he pleases, I guess that’s the reality of professional sport.’

Last Word —  Wasps wing Christian Wade scored a sensational solo try against Leinster last week with a burst of pace and fancy footwork that even brought Irish fans to their feet in raucous tribute.

It was the sort of ‘X-factor’ moment England want to see performed on their behalf, but his lack of bulk continues to count against him. 

After naming an elite squad without Wade in it, Stuart Lancaster said: ‘We talk about Sonny Bill coming back into New Zealand’s back line, alongside Savea and Fekitoa. It’s not to say you can’t have Wade. 

'You can, but have to have the balance right.’ 

In other words, his chance will come only if England deploy sufficiently imposing figures throughout the rest of their back line. Size matters more than ever. Nimble artistry is being blasted out of the Test equation. It is a real shame.
