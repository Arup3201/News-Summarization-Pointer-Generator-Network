His character has been in self-imposed exile ever since he shamelessly ditched his fiancée at the altar during a memorable episode of The Archers.

But now Tom Graham has found himself being dropped by the Radio 4 drama for good, after almost two decades on the soap.

It is a move that has caused distress among the actor’s fans.

Booted out: Tom Graham, 34, has announced that he has been dropped from Radio 4's The Archers, after 17 years of playing Tom Archer

And yesterday, after 17 years of providing the voice for meat products entrepreneur Tom Archer, Mr Graham, 34, revealed he would not be returning to Ambridge.

Claiming he was being ‘deposed’ by the series, just weeks after the programme’s editor admitted some of the younger cast members were to be replaced by more experienced actors, Mr Graham wrote: ‘It is with much sadness that I must announce that after 17 years of playing Tom Archers, the show’s editor has taken the decision to re-cast the part. My reign as the sausage King of Ambridge has come to an end and I am being deposed.

‘I have loved every minute of playing Tom Archer and have grown up alongside him since joining the programme in 1997.’

Graham’s character, who is known for making often disastrous decisions, had been in self-imposed exile ever since he ended his relationship with Kirsty at the altar earlier this year.

The would-be bride arrived at the church only to be told by her fiancé it was over.

And Tom was so ashamed of himself that he left the fictional town of Ambridge, where The Archers is set, and moved to Canada where he got a job running a pig unit.

Mr Graham continued: ‘It is a great loss to me not to be able to continue giving a voice to Tom’s journey when he returns to Ambridge from exile in Canada.’

He added: ‘I would like to thank all Archers fans for their support over the past 17 years. Chatting to listeners, whether they were championing Tom’s early eco-warrior antics, consoling him on the death of John, telling him he wasn’t treating Kirsty well enough, or rolling their eyes at his incessant ready-meal monologues, was undoubtedly the biggest joy of being part of the world’s longest running soap.

‘And so it is with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to my time as Tom Archer. So long, and thanks for all the sausages.’

Yesterday fans of Mr Graham, who has also appeared in TV shows Casualty and Grange Hill, sent messages of support to the actor and, despite his character’s unpopularity following his behaviour at the altar, spoke of their sadness he would be leaving.

One wrote: I’m so sorry to hear that. Not happy with that decision at all,’ while another Tweeted: ‘Oh no. More sabotage of the The Archers by halfwit wannabe-cool BBC eds/prods….’

Others demanded to know why Mr Graham was being replaced, with one asking: Why? What the hell for? If you still wanted to play him, you were him. Why change? You fitted the part perfectly. It’s mad.’

However last night a spokesman for The Archers refused to expand on the decision, stating only: ‘Characters are frequently recast in The Archers and have been since the 1950s. We never comment on future storylines.’
