A hotel shuttle bus slammed into a tractor-trailer on Friday leaving 16 passengers injured including two in a serious condition.

The crash happened just outside Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airport, officials said.

Atlanta Fire Rescue Department spokeswoman Janet Ward said the accident happened around 10.30am (EST).

It's not immediately clear what caused the accident on a loop road across from the AirTran hangar, according to local media reports.

Smash: Sixteen people were taken to the hospital Friday, at least two in serious condition, after they were hurt in a crash between a hotel shuttle bus and a tractor-trailer near Atlanta's airport, officials said

A Grady Memorial Hospital spokeswoman 
said emergency personnel there are treating 10 people, eight with minor 
injuries and two seriously hurt.

The shuttle driver was the most seriously injured, reported the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. The other victims were taken to Atlanta Medical Center.

Ward says the bus served Hampton Inn, Fairfield Inn and Hilton hotels and was headed to the airport.

Authorities initially said there were 18 people on the bus, but now claim there were 16, when it collided with the truck on its way to the airport, according to WSB-TV.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that according to the markings on the bus, the shuttle was operated by MTI Limos.

A call to the operations manager of the company was not immediately returned.

Overhead shots from WSB-TV show the shuttle ran into the left side of the trailer that was stretched across the road.

The
 shuttle bus appeared to have collided with the truck on a divided road 
that loops around the airport. The front of the bus was badly damaged.

The windshield was cracked and it appeared to be significant damage to the engine block. The bus skidded over 90 feet before striking the side of the truck, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Shuttles are a common sight at the world's busiest airport, operated by hotels and off-airport parking services.
