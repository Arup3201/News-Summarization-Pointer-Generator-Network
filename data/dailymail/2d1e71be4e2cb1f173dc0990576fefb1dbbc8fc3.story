The World Association Of Newspapers And News Publishers is meeting Culture Secretary Maria Miller

A world body on Press freedom has warned that the British Government’s plans for a Royal Charter on Press regulation could threaten the independence of newspapers and be used by ‘repressive regimes’ to justify censorship.

The World Association Of Newspapers And News Publishers is visiting Britain and is meeting Culture Secretary Maria Miller and John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons culture select committee.

The Royal Charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen last month, in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists.

It underpins with statute a new body 
to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to
 comply facing ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases.

Newspapers
 and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it 
would bring to an end 300 years of Press freedom.

Instead,
 the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its 
activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation 
(Ipso). It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious 
and systemic wrongdoing.

Vincent
 Peyrègne, chief executive of the World Association, said that the 
Government’s plans for Press regulation could have ‘far-reaching 
consequences across the globe’.

The organisation’s missions are normally reserved for regimes where there are severe concerns about censorship, which have included Ethiopia, Libya, Yemen and Burma.

Mr Peyrègne said: ‘Any threats to the independence of journalism in Britain could be used by repressive regimes worldwide to justify their own controls over the Press.

‘We will endeavour to investigate  all elements that threaten the United Kingdom’s position as a bastion for free and independent media with  the same rigour as we have approached other international Press freedom hot spots in nearly 70 years of defending freedom of expression worldwide.’

The delegation is also speaking to freedom of expression and civil society groups, professional bodies, various industry representatives and academics.

The mission includes representatives of newspapers in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada, the  United States and Pakistan.

The delegation hopes to publish its UK report in February.
