Rapist: Gintas Burinskas, has had his 'lenient' sentence extended to life in prison

A convicted rapist who carried out a 'brutal' sex attack on a woman one month after arriving in the UK from Lithuania has had his 'unduly lenient' prison term overturned and replaced with a life sentence.

Gintas Burinskas, 36, dragged a woman off a street in Northampton and violently assaulted her just four months after he completed he was released from 10-year jail prison sentence in his home country for rape.

Last April, he pleaded guilty to rape and  grievous bodily harm at Northampton Crown Court and was handed another 10-year sentence.

But Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges increased the original jail term during a hearing at the Court of Appeal.

They agreed with submissions made on behalf of Attorney General Dominic Grieve that the sentence was unduly lenient.

Today, Lord Thomas announced the court had quashed the original sentence, replacing it with a life sentence with a minimum term of six years.

He said: 'This was a very serious, sustained, brutal attack by a very dangerous man on a vulnerable woman at night.'

Giving details of the offences, Lord Thomas said Burinskas, who was released from prison in Lithuania in August, 2012, walked up behind his victim and grabbed her round the throat.

The judge said: 'He put his hands around her neck and squeezed her throat. She fought him, and shouted, but he increased the pressure on her throat and she lost consciousness.

'She came to and started shouting again. The offender squeezed her throat again and she lost consciousness for a second time.

'When she next regained consciousness she was on the ground in an area surrounded by trees and bushes.'

Extended: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges increased the original sentence during a hearing at the High Court

As she tried to push him off 'he hit her repeatedly to the face and grabbed her by the throat yet again', Lord Thomas.

During the attack she pleaded with him to stop, and after she tried to run away he caught her and kicked her to the ground.

Lord
 Thomas added: 'He then kicked her to the head some four or five times, 
he stamped on her body and punched her to the stomach. He then dragged 
her across the road and tipped alcohol over her.'

He said the victim suffered fractures to her jaw and lost two teeth. Surgery was needed for the damage to her jaw and face.

The woman was 'devastated' by the incident and thought 'she was going to die'.

Previous hearing: The Lithuanian was given a 10-year sentence for rape at Northampton Crown Court last year

Criticism: Attorney General Dominic Grieve believed sentence orginally handed to the Lithuanian sentence was unduly lenient

Lord Thomas added: 'We are satisfied that the seriousness of this offence is such as to justify the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.'

Michael Ellis, MP for Northampton North, told Mail Online: 'I said when this sentence was passed that it was too lenient.

'But the judges have clearly considered the sentence was far too low, and they were right to increase it. A life sentence is wholly appropriate for this heinous crime and I am pleased to see the process has worked in this instance.

'We must now do everything we can to stop people who have offended abroad  from entering this country.'

It is believed Burinskas came to 
Northampton in November 2012 to visit a family member. He has previously
 served a total of 19 years behind bars in Lithuania.

In most instances, EU rules mean 
Britain must open its doors to citizens of a fellow EU country, even if 
they have a criminal record. But offenders who pose a ‘serious risk’ – 
such as a rapist – can be turned away by border officials.

Lithuania, like other EU member 
states, has given an undertaking to warn if a dangerous individual may 
be travelling to the UK. Last night it remained unclear if the 
Lithuanians had complied with that undertaking or not.

In January last year, Lithuanian 
builder Rimvydas Liorancas battered a Birmingham couple to death at 
their home after slipping in to the country unnoticed despite 
convictions for armed robbery and other offences in his homeland.
