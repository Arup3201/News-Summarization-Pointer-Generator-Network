One of Britain's richest men has got the green light to build his own railway around his £10million country home and grounds.

Billionaire John Caudwell founded mobile giant Phones4u as part of a business empire which was sold for nearly £1.5billion in 2006.

The 62-year-old businessman has now been granted planning permission to build a narrow gauge railway around his 50-room Broughton Hall home, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire.

Business tycoon John Caudwell is to have his own railway built around his £10million Broughton Hall home

The billionaire made his money in mobile phones, selling a group which included Phones4u in 2006

The railway line will run through the estate's 28-acre formal gardens and open parkland and will be used to take the tycoon's family and friends round the expansive grounds.

The railway, which will echo the design of a similar attraction at nearby Weston Park,  will not be open to the public.

The three-mile track will run past the estate's tennis court and indoor swimming pool, through the large gardens and then round the parkland attached to the property.

Mr Caudwall's agent said: 'To enhance the enjoyment of the estate Mr Caudwell wishes to construct a light private narrow gauge railway that travels through both the formal gardens and open parkland.

'This is a private residence so it will be for the enjoyment of family and friends only and will not be open to the public.'

The application was granted on December 22 and will also include an 18m by 9m shed to protect the train when it is not in use.

The building will also provide shelter for 18 cows which graze on the land.

Mr Caudwell, a father-of-five, is currently ranked as the 464th richest person in the world, and the 13th wealthiest in the UK. The philanthropist's net worth is estimated to be around £2billion. 

The railway will take Mr Caudwell and his family around the 28-acre acres of his gardens in Staffordshire

Mike Hanson, director of Rudyard Lake Steam Railway, Leek, Stafforshire has his own similar railway around his home in Lancashire.

He said: 'These little railways are very popular and I'm sure Mr Caudwell will love going round his gardens on a train.

'A lot of millionaires have them built mainly to entertain family and friends on their private land. 

'While it might seem a little unusual to some people, projects like this are more popular than people might think.'

Eccleshall Parish Council confirmed it had not received any objections to the proposals.

Conservative councillor for Eccleshall, Peter Jones, said: 'Mr Caudwell obviously seems to be a bit of a light railway enthusiast.

'Broughton Hall used to be a nunnery so the grounds are quite substantial so this will not affect anybody in Eccleshall.

'It's a private estate so I think it's fine if he wants to build something like this.'

Mr Caudwell made millions from the 2006 sale of Phones4u, which then went into administration last year

His planned railway also includes a shed to keep his train in. The structure will also house a herd of cows

Mr Caudwell founded Phones4u in 1996 before selling the business for £1.47 billion in 2006. The company then entered administration in September last year costing around 2,400 jobs.

He announced last October that he was separating from his partner, Claire Johnson, 45, who he had been with for 13 years, and with whom he had one child, Jacobi, 10.

Another one of Mr Caudwell's sons, Rufus, 19, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that the teenager suffered from agoraphobia.

Rufus, along with sisters Libby, 26, and Rebekah, 35, were the children of Mr Caudwell and his ex-wife Kathryn McFarlane.

The billionaire also has another child, Scarlett, 12, from a relationship he had with Jane Burgess in 2001.

On November 1, 2010 Mr Caudwell was clubbed with an iron bar and his girlfriend Claire Johnson, 45, assaulted by masked robbers who burst into the property.

The raiders escaped with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cash and jewellery in the raid which left Mr Caudwell with a deep gash to his head.

Mr Caudwell is the founder of the Caudwell Children charity, which provides  support, equipment, treatment and therapy for disabled youngsters.
