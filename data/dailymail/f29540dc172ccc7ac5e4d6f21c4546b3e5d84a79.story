A great-grandmother died after she was left waiting for at least 40 minutes in a queue of 15 ambulances outside a hospital’s accident and emergency department yesterday.

Sonia Powell, 73, who had suffered a heart attack, was kept waiting outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea - and died just 24 hours after her younger sister Cheryl Davies, 64, also passed away.

Today, her relatives demanded an apology from health chiefs, following a warning from the British Medical Association that the NHS in Wales was facing ‘imminent meltdown’.

The family of Mrs Powell - who was being moved 12 miles north-west from Neath Port Talbot Hospital - claimed a doctor had only been with her for a few minutes before she died outside Morriston.

Granddaughter Kim Thompson said Mrs Powell had suffered a heart attack yesterday morning after being admitted to Neath Port Talbot on Monday.

Mrs Thompson said the family was told she would be moved if her condition worsened, which was the case - but when Mrs Powell arrived at Morriston there was confusion over why she was there.

The 31-year-old said: ‘The ambulance man took the notes to a doctor, who asked what the lady was doing there.’

She said that a doctor at Morriston said there had been nothing to gain by transferring her to the larger hospital. Mrs Thompson added: ‘We were not happy. She was very, very unwell and should never have been moved in the first place.’

She claimed that her grandmother was in the ambulance for an hour - not the 30 or 40 minutes claimed by the Welsh Ambulance Service and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘It was only two minutes before my gran passed away that the registrar or doctor turned up at the ambulance. We really want an apology for the way they treated her.’

Mrs Powell lived in Neath with her 
husband Raymond who was being comforted by relatives today.  The WAS and
 ABMUHB confirmed they had launched a review into the incident outside 
Morriston.

They said in a joint statement: ‘The 
emergency department at Morriston Hospital has been very busy with a 
high number of ambulances arriving in a short space of time.

‘Escalation
 plans have been activated and staff across the hospital are working 
closely with colleagues from Wast (Welsh Ambulance Service Trust) to 
keep delays to a minimum.’

Officials confirmed the patient arrived at Morriston from another hospital at about 3.05pm yesterday.

A
 statement read: ‘The patient was assessed immediately upon arrival and 
remained in the care of a doctor and the ambulance crew whilst waiting 
to be admitted into hospital.

‘Sadly, at approximately 3.40pm the patient passed away. We wish to express our sincere condolences to the patient’s family.’

Later today, a further statement from 
ABMUHB said: ‘The Health Board is reviewing all aspects of what happened
 and we are currently discussing these with the family.

'We were not happy. She was very, very unwell and should never have been moved in the first place'

‘We can confirm the ambulance with two paramedics on board left Neath Port Talbot Hospital at 2.49pm and arrived at Morriston Hospital at 3.04pm.

‘The emergency department doctor began his assessment of the patient in the ambulance at 3.07pm. A doctor remained with Mrs Powell on the ambulance until she sadly passed away at 3.40pm.’

A spokesman added if a patient deteriorated in a ‘supporting’ hospital and could benefit from treatment available at an ‘acute hospital’, ABMUHB would arrange for an ambulance to transfer them.

‘Yesterday was a busy day for emergency departments and this was intensified at Morriston by 20 emergency ambulances arriving and departing within a short space of time,’ she continued.

‘At its peak, there were 12 operational ambulances outside the department but not all had patients on board.’

ABMUHB also stressed, upon arrival that all
 medical emergencies were assessed by a doctor in the emergency department to ensure ‘they receive the most appropriate treatment before
 being transferred to a bed’.

In recent months there has been 
growing concern about Wales’s NHS as well as ambulance service 
performance. Yesterday, the BMA called for an independent inquiry into 
the health service.

The
 organisation, which represents around 7,000 doctors in Wales, published
 a report listing numerous problems it believes the Welsh Government 
must address.

BMA Welsh Council chairman Dr Phil Banfield said members’ feedback indicated the service was struggling to cope.

He said: ‘The sooner this (inquiry) 
takes place, the better. There’s a lot of sticking heads in the sand 
still going on. Our greatest fear is it will become impossible to have 
an NHS in Wales.’

The issue of ambulance response times has also been raised several times by opposition parties in the Welsh Assembly.

According
 to the latest official figures, the Welsh Ambulance Service failed to 
hit response time targets for the most urgent calls for a ninth 
consecutive month.

Statistics
 also showed that 87.7 per cent of people arriving at Welsh A&Es 
were seen within four hours of arrival - the Welsh Government target is 
95 per cent.

The worst-performing health board was Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, with nearly 17 per cent of patients waiting more than four hours.

Health campaigners said they were extremely concerned to hear about the incident at Morriston Hospital yesterday.

Among
 them was Gareth Williams of the ABMU Victim Support Group. His 
82-year-old mother Lillian suffered what the health board accepted was 
unacceptable treatment before her death at the Princess of Wales 
Hospital in Bridgend in 2012.

Mr
 Williams said: ‘To hear reports a woman died while waiting more than 
half an hour to be taken inside A&E doesn't really surprise me, 
sadly. I don't believe you can take the incident in isolation.

‘It seems to be disaster after disaster 
of late. The ongoing systemic failures at ABMU are a major concern. The 
way things stand, ABMU is not fit for purpose and the need for decisive 
action is long overdue.’

'There's a lot of sticking heads in the sand still going on. Our greatest fear is it will become impossible to have an NHS in Wales'

Dr Phil Banfield, British Medical Association Welsh Council chairman

Welsh Conservative Assembly Member and shadow health minister Darren Millar renewed calls for a ‘Keogh-style’ inquiry into the Welsh NHS.

He said: ‘The evidence is stacking up, demonstrating that all is not well in the Welsh health service and an independent inquiry could help identify problems and put them right, before it's too late.

‘Experienced medical experts are saying that without an inquiry, some NHS services are facing imminent meltdown - a disturbing warning that Labour ministers must heed.

‘Do-gooders who defensively act as cheerleaders for their local health board and reject any sort of review are putting Welsh patients at risk.

‘We love the NHS and want to help staff deliver the best possible service for patients, but that is only possible if we have the courage to hold a thorough inquiry to identify any problems and put them right.’
