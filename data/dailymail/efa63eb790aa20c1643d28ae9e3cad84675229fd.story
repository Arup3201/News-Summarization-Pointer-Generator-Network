A video for the track that has been ‘scientifically proven’ to be the most relaxing song in the world has been released as part of an album with five other songs.

Named Weightless, the music can apparently slow the heart rate, reduce blood pressure and decrease levels of cortisol – a steroid hormone released in response to stress.

The track has been labelled ‘the most relaxing song in the world’, beating other contenders including Adele and Coldplay.

Manchester-based band Marconi Union has released a video for their song Weightless which is said to be the most relaxing song in the world (clip from video shown). In 2011 the song topped a scientific list of relaxing songs. The video sees a drone with lights fly above water in the Lake District

The eight-minute long track was made by Manchester-based Marconi Union in collaboration with the British Academy of Sound Therapy.

It was claimed to be the most relaxing song ever after a scientific study by the Mindlab Institution in 2011.

1) Marconi Union - Weightless

2) Airstream - Electra

3) DJ Shah - Mellomaniac (Chill Out Mix)

4) Enya - Watermark

5) Coldplay - Strawberry Swing

6) Barcelona - Please Don't Go

7) All Saints - Pure Shores

8) Adele - Someone Like You

9) Mozart - Canzonetta Sull'aria

10) Cafe Del Mar - We Can Fly 

Since then the band has expanded upon the original song, releasing a video for it and recording five others.

The director of the video Ritchie Johnston said he used a drone because its ‘grace in the air and precise flight capabilities made it the ideal subject for the shoot.’

He continued: ‘Orchestrating the routine together proved challenging as I was using a technique that revealed unperceivable patterns which I was unable to fully comprehend until the project was finally finished.

‘On further discussion we settled on a location for the shoot, a small tarn situated near Blencathra, a mountain in the Lake District.’

He then flew the drone over the waters in a precise pattern, and later used 130 layers of HD video to create a time-lapse effect.

In 2011 scientists played the song to 40 women and found it to be more effective at helping them relax than songs by Enya, Mozart and Coldplay. 

The women were connected to sensors and given challenging puzzles to complete against the clock in order to induce a level of stress.

They were then played different songs as their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and brain activity were recorded.

Studies found Weightless was 11 per cent more relaxing than any other song and even made many of the women 'drowsy' in the lab.

It induced a 65 per cent reduction in overall anxiety and brought them to a level 35 per cent lower than their usual resting rates.

The ambient song features guitar, piano and electronic samples of natural soundscapes. 

Lyz Cooper, founder of the British Academy of Sound Therapy, said Marconi Union had used scientific theory to make the 'perfect relaxing song.'

The new album from Marconi Union is called Weightless (Ambient Transmissions Vol 2).
