A sold-out unicorn motif sweater worn by Sasha Obama has sparked a demand for its manufacturer to reissue it.

The 12-year-old first daughter wore the $18 unicorn design by ASOS to a college basketball game in College Park, Maryland on Sunday.

Since photos of the appearance were published, the online retailer has been slammed with requests from shoppers keen to replicate the youngster’s look.

Hot item: Sasha Obama's unicorn sweater has prompted massive response from fashion-obsessed Twitter users

Full outfit: She paired the top with cuffed skinny jeans and blue plimsoll sneakers

Tony Manfred, a sports reporter for Business Insider, even wrote: 'Knitting this myself if I can't find it on eBay’

In
response to the demand, ASOS told fans that it is looking into the 
possibility of restocking the sweater, which was originally on sale at 
$62.69 before going on sale at $18.69.

A
Twitter post read: ‘Love Love Love the Unicorn sweater. We’re not sure 
at the [moment] if it’ll be restocked, but watch this space…’

If the sweater were to be reissued, it would certainly be met by much fanfare.

Kieran Patrick Burns’ remarks on Twitter are representative of the sweater's general response.

'Sasha Obama looking sharp with the unicorn sweater,' he dispatched.

On ASOS: The ASOS design is sold out online, but the retailer could be considering a restock

And Kristen Holmes [‏@kristenholmes20] wrote: ‘Sasha Obama is a regular #hipster! Check out the unicorn sweater.’

The
Obama daughters have long been fans of ASOS. Sasha wore an ASOS dress 
to last year’s White House Christmas tree lighting, while Malia wore a 
blue satiny skirt last year on election night.

If
the online retailer were to restock the item, it would be diverging 
from what other Obama-endorsed fashion lines have refused to do in the 
past.

When  Sasha, Malia, 
and Michelle Obama wore J.Crew items to President Obama’s second term 
inauguration last January, causing the designs to quickly sell out, the 
brand’s creative director Jenna Lyons announced that J.Crew would not 
reproduce the items ‘out of respect,’ for the first family.

As
of press time, ASOS had not restocked the unicorn sweater. The company 
was not immediately able to provide a comment when reached by 
MailOnline.
