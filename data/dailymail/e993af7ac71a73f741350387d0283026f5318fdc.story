A trip to a shopping center in Lake Worth, Texas, ended in a tragedy on Saturday when a 7-year-old girl was mowed down by an out-of-control pickup truck that also injured five other people.

The incident happened at around 2:00pm in the parking lot of the Target and Ross stores in the 6300 block of Lake Worth Avenue when the driver of a black pickup truck, identified as 84-year-old Vincent Martinez, slammed into several pedestrians.

According to paramedics, six people in the parking lot were seriously injured, among them two adults and four children between the ages of seven and 14, NBC5 reported.

Horrific crash: A black pickup truck accelerated and came to rest on top of a white Lexus in the parking lot of a Lake Worth, Texas, shopping center

Innocent bystanders: A total of six people, including of four children, were injured in the crash, one of them fatally

Unnamed victim: An eyewitness said the impact of the crash threw the 7-year-old onto the windshield of his car before she fell to the ground

All of the kids were taken to Cook Children's Medical Center. One of them, a 7-year-old girl, died from her injuries, according to Lake Worth police. Authorities have yet to release the victims’ names.

Martinez’s daughter, Ester Zenteno, said that her father is diabetic and may have gone into diabetic shock from improper insulin intake at the time of the crash.

‘He does take insulin and I can't say 100 per cent that he took it this morning,’ she told NBC5. ‘I'm assuming that his sugar went out of control.’

Zenteno said that her father would 
rather be dead than hurt someone, adding that he is going to ‘go crazy’ 
when he finds out what happened.

Possible explanation: Martinez's daughter, Ester Zenteno, right, said her father is diabetic, and it's possible that he forgot to take his insulin in the morning

‘My heart goes out to the family, the family that is hurt,’ she told MyFox DFW through tears.

Martinez and the two adult victims were taken to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth.

Eyewitness Paul Rahl said that he was sitting in his white Lexus waiting for his family at around 1:40pm when Martinez's truck crashed into him and came to rest on top of his car. Rahl said he saw the 7-year-old girl hit his windshield and then tumble to the ground.

‘Her little hair is still in my windshield,’ he told the station CW33.

The first four victims were struck 
outside the Ross clothing store, including one woman who was hit just 
moments after she came out into the parking lot. 

Investigation: Police are reviewing surveillance tapes from the parking lot to determine the cause of the crash

‘She was just on the ground, face down,’ witness Brittaney Scott told CW33.

Police are looking at surveillance tapes from the parking lot in hopes of determining what caused the accident.
