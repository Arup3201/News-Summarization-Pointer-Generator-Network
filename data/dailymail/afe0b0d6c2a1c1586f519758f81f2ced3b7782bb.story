Police have released photos of almost a quarter of a ton of heroin which they found crammed into the bumpers, wheel arches and engine of a silver Jaguar.

The luxury car had been 
delivered to a business in the area of Romford, Essex, last Friday before it was examined by police, the National Crime Agency said.

They found 198kg of the drug, worth £40 million, stuffed into almost every available space, including the rear seats, dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment.

Heroin: Officers from the National Crime Agency have released photos of this Jaguar which was found with £40 million of heroin (foreground) stuffed into the bumpers, wheel arches, seats and even the engine

Illusion: The silver Jaguar appeared normal from the outside. The cars sell new from about £30,000

Hidden: A photo shows the multi-coloured packets stuffed into the car's spare wheel compartment

Haul: Numerous black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats, removed by police

Crammed: Officers said the luxury car was stuffed full of 198kg of heroin in scores of separate packets

Officers responded in the early hours of Saturday and arrested two men in Luton, Bedfordshire, 50 miles away.

The pair have now appeared in court charged with drugs offences.

Noman
Qureshi, 32, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Israr Khan, 34, of Luton,
Bedfordshire, were charged with conspiracy to supply heroin.

They were remanded in custody after appearing at Luton Magistrates' Court on Monday.

The National Crime Agency replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency in October and is a government department dubbed the 'British FBI'.

Its role is to uncover child exploitation, drugs gangs, economic criminals and breaches of border controls.

Even tiny spare spaces in the car were used, said police, including in this photo under the bonnet

Huge: Officers recovered scores of packages. This haul appeared to measure about six feet across

Two men have been arrested in connection with the alleged haul. Noman Qureshi, 32, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Israr Khan, 34, of Luton, Bedfordshire, were charged with conspiracy to supply heroin
