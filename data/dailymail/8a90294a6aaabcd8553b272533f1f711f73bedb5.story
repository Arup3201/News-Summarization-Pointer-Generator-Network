There may be clear daylight between Chelsea and the rest of the Premier League, but Jose Mourinho isn’t a happy man. He’s barely raised a smile all season, with international football — and more pertinently the World Cup — to blame.

Despite five wins from six he is irked at the amount of time it’s taken for his stars — particularly the Brazilian trio of Oscar, Willian and Ramires — to energise themselves after returning in July.

The Portuguese has been forced to rotate his squad far more than he would have liked in the opening six weeks, laying the blame on the carnival in Brazil and suggesting players need longer breaks or risk severe burnout.

Jose Mourinho is less than happy despite Chelsea's flying start to the season 

Chelsea's convincing win against Villa marked Chelsea's 2000th home league game since the club's inception in 1905 

‘They need holidays, they don’t have holidays,’ Mourinho said. ‘They need a proper pre-season, they don’t have a proper pre- season. I think players are getting in trouble and when I anticipate the next pre-season it will be even worse, because there will be international matches.

‘For a World Cup some teams don’t qualify; for the international fixtures, every player goes with his national team. After that, before the start of the Premier League, they are going to have, like, two weeks of pre-season.’

Mourinho is particularly worried by the Copa America in June, which means his South American stars face back-to-back tournaments sandwiching the rigours of a season the Blues hope will last upwards of 60 games.

Diego Costa continued his flying start to the season with a stunning header against Aston Villa 

He joked the club might have to sell their Latin throng — which stands at four including Filipe Luis — because of the competition.

Sporting warmed up for the Champions League match with Chelsea in Lisbon with a 1-1 draw with bitter rivals Porto. Jonathan Silva put them ahead before a Mouhamadou-Naby Sarr own goal condemned them to a fourth 1-1 draw this season

Credit must be thrown in Mourinho’s direction though. While he does have a squad stacked with quality, the way in which he has tinkered with it has been astute.

Oscar — the standout of Saturday’s win against Aston Villa — has been a chief beneficiary. Dropped against Schalke and Manchester City, he came back against Bolton in the Capital One Cup.

Two goals later those decisions look shrewd, particularly after this sparkling display in which he opened the scoring.

‘I have had time,’ Oscar said. ‘Mourinho told me he has a lot of players, so I don’t play against City, or Schalke at the start. But I start against Bolton and I play well because I am not tired.’

Chelsea enter their second truly testing week of the season at Sporting Lisbon tomorrow before facing Arsenal on Sunday, with the club unsure whether Diego Costa will be fit enough to carry on. Mourinho said the Spain forward is ‘doing nothing’ in training as medical staff nurse him through games.

Ramires is another of Chelsea's growing Brazilian contingent with the signing of Felipe Luis making it four Samba stars
