Abby Hernandez, the teen who vanished for nine months before returning home in July, was violently abducted by a stranger before suffering 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence', her lawyer has said.

Michael Coyne released a statement on Tuesday that shed some light on what happened to the now 15-year-old from Conway, New Hampshire after she was allegedly abducted by Nathaniel Kibby, 34, in October - but many questions still remain over exactly how she was kidnapped and returned home.

'As the justice system moves forward,
 and the evidence is revealed, questions about this horrific event will 
be answered,' read the statement, written on behalf of Abby and her mother Zenya.

Safe: Abby Hernandez, pictured in court with her mother on July 29, suffered 'unspeakable violence' at the hands of her abductor after she vanished in October, her lawyer has said

'Abby was violently abducted 
by a stranger. For many months, she suffered numerous acts of 
unspeakable violence. Through her faith, fortitude and resilience, she 
is alive today and home with her family.'

The statement was shared on the website, 'Bring Abby Home', which was created after Abby, then 14, vanished on October 9 as she left school.

Nathaniel Kibby has been charged with her kidnapping and remains in jail, but mystery still surrounds exactly how Abby was abducted and what happened to her during her alleged captivity.

She previously revealed that she often had access to the local paper, The Conway Daily Sun, and that it gave her hope because she realized people were still looking for her.

Accused: Nathaniel Kibby, 34, is pictured in court on August 6. He has been charged with abducting Abby

Previous reports suggested Abby might have been confined in a shipping container kept behind Kibby's home in Gorham, and MailOnline revealed that 
the container may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms.

One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a 
tunnel from his trailer to the container.

In court last week, prosecutors said the container did have three sections, with the 
middle section being the largest.

Defense attorney Jesse Friedman asked for the judge to block the 
prosecution's attempt to remove the mobile home and a shipping 
container, arguing that he needs to keep all 
the evidence preserved because he has so little information on why his 
client was arrested.

Scene: Authorities are pictured investigating the area outside Kibby's home in July. There has been speculation that he kept her captive in this storage container, which was divided in to three rooms

Kibby is charged with a felony count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison if he's convicted. He's being held on $1 million cash bail.

The 
family's statement on Tuesday thanked law enforcement and the media for helping to bring her
 home, but added that the teenager now needs time to work through the 
ordeal.

'Abby needs and wants some time and space
 to physically and emotionally heal,' it read. 'It is going to be a long process 
in pursuit of justice for Abby.'

The following statement was posted on the 'Bring Abby Home' website on behalf of Abby and her mother. It was written by one of their lawyers, Michael Coyne.

On behalf of Abigail Hernandez and her mother, Zenya Hernandez, we want to thank the New Hampshire State Police, the FBI, the Conway Police Department, all of the many law enforcement agencies that were involved in this effort, the community of Conway, the people of New England and everyone that cared about Abby’s abduction and prayed for Abby’s safe return as well as the media's efforts to bring attention to her kidnapping and assist with her miraculous survival.

Abby needs and wants some time and space to physically and emotionally heal.  It is going to be a long process in pursuit of justice for Abby and for Abby to get physically and emotionally stronger.  We do not intend to have this case tried in the press. As the justice system moves forward, and the evidence is revealed, questions about this horrific event will be answered. Abby was violently abducted by a stranger.  For many months, she suffered numerous acts of unspeakable violence.  Through her faith, fortitude and resilience, she is alive today and home with her family.

Abby simply asks that you respect her wishes and the justice process as this case moves forward. We trust that justice will be done.  On behalf of Abby, we ask that you be sensitive to the well-being of this child and give her the time and space she needs—that any of us would desire for a member of our own family or loved one who suffered as she has. Abigail and Zenya Hernandez are represented by Michael L. Coyne of Andover, Massachusetts and Steven Hyde and Briana Coakley of Coakley and Hyde in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
