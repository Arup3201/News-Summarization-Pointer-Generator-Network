Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes Lionel Messi will grow frustrated at Barcelona if he fails to keep up with Cristiano Ronaldo's impressive goalscoring league form.

Messi has been deployed on the wing in recent weeks in order for Barcelona boss Luis Enrique to accommodate summer signing Luis Suarez in his new three-pronged attack.

The Argentina captain's form in front of the net has suffered since the arrival of Suarez at the Nou Camp.

Ronaldo has scored an outstanding 18 goals in the league so far this season as compared to Messi's seven.

Wenger, speaking to BeIn Sport, said: 'When Messi sees that Ronaldo has scored so many more goals than him, it will play on his morale.

'On the wings, he cannot maintain his goal average. In the long term, he won't be happy.

'The best player in the team has a power within the club. He can make the coach better if there is chemistry between them.

'So, if his position doesn't suit him, it weakens the team as whole.'

Messi and Ronaldo will go head-to-head on Tuesday when Argentina take on Portugal in an international friendly match at Old Trafford.
