Banned: Jockey Tom Queally has been disqualified from driving for 22 months after he was arrested twice over the legal alcohol limit

A top jockey caught drink-driving walked free from court yesterday after claiming he was ‘sleep-driving’.

Tom Queally, 30, who rode legendary winner Frankel, said he was a habitual sleep-walker and had no recollection of setting off in his BMW.

When motorists saw him parked in the middle of the road and knocked on the window, he drove off and pulled on to a garage forecourt, where he fell asleep again with the engine running.

He was woken by police who found he was more than two times the drink-drive limit.

Drink-driving carries a maximum jail term of six months.

Queally was represented by Nick Freeman – known as Mr Loophole after defending celebrities such as Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham against motoring charges – who said the jockey had been a sleep-walker from childhood.

But millionaire Queally was forced to plead guilty to the offence as a sleeping condition is not a legal defence.

He walked free from court after District Judge Bridget Knight banned him from the road for 22 months and ordered him to pay costs and fines of almost £5,000.

Crewe Magistrates’ Court was told the Irish jockey, who earned £2.5million in one year, had been out for dinner with his agent Nicholas Whittle. 

He was supposed to sleep at Mr Whittle’s house, but got up and went off in his £70,000 BMW 730.

He was spotted by another motorist asleep in the car at 5am on March 16 in the middle of a road in Knutsford, Cheshire. Queally then drove off and was later seen parked at a Shell garage five miles away, asleep in the passenger seat.

When officers breathalysed him, he had 84mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – more than twice the legal limit of 35mg.

Kate Marchuk, prosecuting, said Queally ‘rolled out’ of a police car and curled up on the ground like he was napping. 

Mr Freeman said: ‘He was unaware of what he was doing – he was sleep-driving. The defendant’s last recollection was lying on the bed, fully clothed, reading Horse & Hound magazine.

‘While asleep... he drove for no reason 300 or so yards and parked in the carriageway. Mr Queally is blameless. This is not a man who has knowingly got into a car while drunk. He has no defence in terms of guilt but is completely innocent on a moral basis.’

Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, of the London Sleep Centre, told the court: ‘Mr Queally has a long history of sleep-walking, and his brother and father were sleep-walkers.

‘From a medical perspective he was unaware of his actions.’

Outside court, Mr Freeman said it was time for sleep-walking to be recognised by the law, adding: ‘Perversely, had he raped or murdered someone, this would have provided him with a defence, but not for drink-driving – and that is not fair.’
