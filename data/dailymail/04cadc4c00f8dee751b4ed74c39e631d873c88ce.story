A police officer in Florida made an incredibly generous gesture this week after it appears some creep did the unthinkable: Stole the wedding ring of an elderly Alzheimer's patient who is sedated in a hospital.

The yellow-gold diamond engagement ring has been on the hand of 87-year-old Betty Wagner for the last 67 years - after her husband, Arthur Wagner, bought it for her in the summer of 1946.

'She said, "Yes." I remember I bought it at Zales jewelry. I paid $400 for it,' Arthur Wagner told a local news outlet. 'I came in the morning, and I'm holding her hand, talking to her, and the ring is gone.'

Hero: When Plantation Police Officer Laurie Graber was assigned the case she was heartbroken for the elderly couple

When Plantation Police Officer Laurie Graber was tasked with investigating the apparent theft at the Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, she was overcome with grief over what had happened to the still-beaming couple.

'After 67 years of that ring being on her finger, she still looked at him
 like he was her knight in shinning armor, and he looked at her like she
 was still his young bride,' Graber tells WSVN.

So Graber did what she could to replace Wagner's ring.

'I went to J.C. Penney, and I bought a small ring, and I took it back to the hospital, and I left a little note,' the officer says.

Thief: Authorities say bruising on Betty Wagner's finger indicate that the ring was pulled off and stolen rather than simply lost

When Arthur Wagner showed up to the hospital the following day, the nurses told him that Graber had stopped by and left something for he and his wife.

'A promise kept for 67 years is worth something,' the note read, and with it was the small ring.

'I just couldn't imagine what kind of depravity you would have to have to
 take something off of someone so vulnerable,' said Graber.

Investigators believe the ring was stolen rather than lost because of injuries found on Betty Wagner's hand.

Crime scene: Police are reviewing surveillance footage to see if it gives them any help in finding who stole Wagner's ring

'From the bruises on her finger that looked like both rings were pulled 
off, and the wedding band was put back on,' said Wagner. 'I just tear 
up. It was tough.'

Police say they are checking the hospital's surveillance video to see if they can identify a suspect.

Anyone with information about the stolen ring is asked to call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Tipsters can stay anonymous and may be eligible for a reward.
