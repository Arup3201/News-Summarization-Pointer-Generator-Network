We’ve just had the draw for the European Championships this summer and it’s exciting to think that the tournament will be staged on home soil in Worcester.

We’ve won the tournament the last two times – in 2011 and 2013 – so it would be a really special achievement to win a hat-trick on our own patch.

Traditionally the hosts get to pick which group they go into, and we are now in Pool A with Poland, Spain, Czech Republic, France and Germany. The way it’s worked means we have a slightly harder group but it could potentially be easier in the next stage. In Pool B it’s Holland, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy, so it must have been a tough decision for the coaches.

Team GB have won the last two tournaments in 2011 and 2013, and 2015 is being hosted in Worcester 

Our group will be tough, though. Germany are a good side and probably the team to watch out for, but with them you can catch them in different form throughout the tournament. They often start strong but then tend to drop off a little bit towards the end. We might be able to play them before the tournament to gauge how they are.

France are another enigma – they came second in the Worlds in 2010 and then bottom of the Europeans the next year and went down a division. But they’ve worked their way back up and could be tricky. Spain are like Germany and can be the best team in the world or implode, but we always seem to play well against them so I think we’ll be OK. As for Poland, they have got weaker over the past few years and the Czech Republic, I won’t lie, I’ve never seen them play! That’ s because they’ve not been in the top division for a while but we’ll have to be wary of them.

I think we’ll definitely qualify for the knockouts as four from each group go through, but all it takes is for the other teams to show up and it could be tough. But wheelchair basketball is always difficult to predict. You never know what the others are going to do.

Having missed out on London 2012, this is my first senior major on home soil, so I’m very excited by it. I’m playing in the league in Spain right now so it hasn’t really sunk in yet. But come April or May I’ll suddenly think: ‘Ooh, this is going to be good.’

In terms of support, my mum has hired a little studio apartment for the duration and a few others will come down so hopefully there’ll be plenty of noise from my end. But as far as I’m aware, she has this one-bed place but eight or 10 of them want to stay down there. It will be a tight squeeze.

I’m still only 20 but it’s nice to be a more experience member of the GB squad now. I was at the European Juniors last year and a few of those players are now in the seniors and because they know me they feel they can come to me and ask questions. 

So that’s good for some new youngsters to be coming through and for us all to know each other and get on well. We have a GB training camp coming up in the next few weeks and that will be a good chance for us all to meet up. We’re off to Italy, somewhere near Milan, and we’re lucky that National Lottery funding helps us with those kind of camps. They’re always so vital for us to train and practise together.

For me personally I’m enjoying my second season playing for Amiab in the Spanish league. We’re based in Albacete, which is quite a remote city. There’s hardly any tourism or anything like that, but it makes it easier to focus on wheelchair basketball.

As for my Spanish, it’s getting there. I’m quite good at understanding it now but speaking isn't so good. We have a translator on our team who comes to games as well just in case… Sometimes when it comes down to it you tend to forget your tenses and things like that.

There’s five other Brits in my team so it’s nice to hang out together. We have our own places but three of us are all within about 100 yards of each other so that’s perfect. 

As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities. Find out where your money goes atwww.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk
