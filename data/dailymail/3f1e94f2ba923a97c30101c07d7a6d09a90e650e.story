Despite turning Chelsea down on at least two occasions, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has scored as many goals for the them as he has against them.

As the former England captain prepares to pack his bags and head for Major League Soccer, an astonishing stat has emerged: Gerrard has played Chelsea 39 times in his Liverpool career, but has managed just one goal against them.

It came in the Premier League in 2005, when a 25-year-old Gerrard, fresh from lifting a Champions League trophy five months earlier, netted to level the match at 1-1.

Frank Lampard had put Jose Mourinho's side 1-0 up from the penalty spot before Gerrard's leveller, but even his one goal against them did not end in success as Damien Duff, Joe Cole and substitute Geremi made it a day to forget for Liverpool as they crashed 4-1.

The previous February, Gerrard had scored a goal for Chelsea in the League Cup final in Cardiff.

After John Arne Riise's early strike, the captain's unfortunate deflection from a Paulo Ferreira free-kick saw him on the scoresheet for all the wrong reasons, and his day was made worse by Chelsea's eventual extra-time win.

No goals against the Blues in the following decade have resulted in a rather unfortunate record that is likely to stay with Gerrard for the rest of his career.

Tuesday night saw him take to the field against Chelsea for the 39th time, but he was unable to stop an extra-time winner from Branislav Ivanovic, ending his hopes of lifting the Capital One Cup at Wembley in March.

Now, the FA Cup represents Gerrard's final chance to lift a trophy in Liverpool colours. The Reds travel to Bolton next Wednesday, where a tie against Crystal Palace awaits in the fifth round if they come through.

He does, though, have one final chance to score against Mourinho's side. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge on May 9, in what is set to be Gerrard's third-to-last Premier League game for the club.

With the title out of Liverpool's grasp, the match will potentially have a bearing on whether Anfield will experience Champions League football again next season. 

If not that, then it is simply a chance for Gerrard to improve his poor record.
