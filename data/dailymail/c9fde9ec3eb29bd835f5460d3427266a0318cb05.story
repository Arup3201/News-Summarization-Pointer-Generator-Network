When Ed Sheeran played in front of thousands of fans at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Concert, he may well have felt strangely at home.

For the chart-topping singer has revealed that, as a teenager struggling to make his mark in the music industry, he slept rough under an arch next to the Palace.

Now 23 – and despite becoming one of Britain’s leading stars with an estimated fortune in excess of £7million and with his latest album X topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic – the memory of being homeless has left an indelible legacy in one of his songs.

Since his success, however, he is more likely to be invited inside rather than sleeping on a hot vent outside 

Sheeran said: ‘There was an arch outside Buckingham Palace that has a heating duct and I spent a couple of nights there.

‘That’s where I wrote the song Homeless and the lines “It’s not a homeless night for me, I’m just home less than I’d like to be.” ’

Sheeran described his unorthodox living arrangements in a new book called A Visual Journey, which charts his rise to the top. The star was 16 when he moved from Suffolk to London in 2007 to study at music college. But when the course ended, he no longer had a grant to pay for the rent and had to carve out a living performing gigs and selling CDs from a rucksack.

He spent the next two and a half years sleeping on London Underground trains or ‘sofa surfing’ in friends’ homes. He said: ‘I didn’t have anywhere to live for much of 2008 and the whole of 2009 and 2010, but somehow I made it work.

‘I knew where I could get a bed at a certain time of night and I knew who I could call at any time to get a floor to sleep on. Being sociable helped. Drinking helped.’

Sheeran, who has written hits for One Direction and Taylor Swift, said he found his nomadic existence enjoyable but admitted there were some ‘hairy’ periods. ‘I spent a week catching up on sleep on Circle Line trains,’ he said.

‘I’d go out and play a gig, wait until 5am when the Underground opened, sleep on the Circle Line until 12, go to a session – and then repeat. It wasn’t that bad.

‘It’s not like I was sleeping rough on the cold streets.’

As a struggling performer, Sheeran has admitted he slept on the street outside Buckingham Palace

The singer released his debut album in 2011, and by the following year was playing before the Queen. And, while he does not give a precise location for the arch by the Palace and it is not clear when exactly he stayed there, he admits his alternative lifestyle did take one particular toll.

‘I didn’t have the best personal hygiene at that point because I didn’t get a chance to shower,’ said Sheeran, who now has two Brit awards and an Ivor Novello award.

‘It was just: sleep on the train, session, sweat on stage, drink, sleep on the train. I had 23 dreads on one side of my head from not washing my hair. My girlfriend counted them when she took them out with a comb.’ 

Meanwhile, a fresh-faced Ed performed in concert at the First Direct arena in Leeds

He also admits he would often be drunk on stage during his early gigs although he now says he never drinks before a performance.

Sheeran’s current lifestyle couldn’t be further removed from his previous existence dossing in London.

Home is a large farm he bought in 2012 close to where he grew up in Framlingham, Suffolk.

And last year he also splashed out on a £2 million ranch in Nashville, close to the home of his former girlfriend, Amerian singer Swift. He has also been linked to pop star Ellie Goulding and recently performed at a private house party where the guests included David Cameron.

Last night, Sheeran and his manager were unavailable for comment.

Wow: The singer's star is almost certainly on the rise
