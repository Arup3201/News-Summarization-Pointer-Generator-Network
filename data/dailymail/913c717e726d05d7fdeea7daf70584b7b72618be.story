Wellies, rain ponchos and stoic expressions... what better way to face the Bank Holiday weekend washout?

Although these revellers at the Leeds Festival had to brave the occasional shower, others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12-hour deluge.

Many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed, resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over.

Then the heavens opened – and stayed open in some areas from first thing in the morning to well into the evening.

And forecasters predict it's not over yet – heavy and persistent rain will sweep through large swathes of Britain today.  

Long rainy spells are due in the north west, west and Scotland with the wet weather continuing into tomorrow in many areas.

Britons who had their hopes of a glorious Bank Holiday dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations.

The wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported bites.

There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem.

Tesco saw sales of creams shoot up by 150 per cent last week, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years.

Sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours.

Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two.

He said the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its name - also lives off dogs, ferrets and humans.

Later in the week parts of the country
will shiver as temperatures plummet. They could go as low as  3C (37F) 
overnight on Thursday.  Forecasters believe the summer of 2012 never 
really got off the ground.

Brendan Jones from Meteo group summed it up.

'Already the summer we never really had is drawing to a close,' he said.

'Given that June was one of the 
wettest since the mid 1800s and July was another very wet month –if you 
add all those together you're looking at a fairly cool wet summer.

'And there are some decent bouts of 
rain to come.' Scotland faced the worst of the bad weather over the 
weekend, with strong winds, and heavy rain leading to minor floods.

At the other end of the country, Cornwall and Devon took the brunt of a wintery storm sweeping in from the Atlantic.

The Exeter-based Met Office yesterday 
issued a yellow alert, warning of localised flooding as heavy rain and 
winds lashed the area.

In St Mawes holidaymakers venturing 
out for a stroll ended up soaked to the skin in minutes and running for 
shelter. Deck chairs went flying and boats in the harbour smashed 
against each other as near gale-force winds swept in.

'It really does feel like the end of 
summer – and it's one we will want to forget in a hurry,' said Marilyn 
Beacroft from Kent, who was in St Mawes for the wedding of her son, 
James.

'Everyone's cold, wet and fed up with 
this weather and it seems like we've endured this for weeks. We won't 
want to remember the summer of 2012 for long!'

Saturday had already been a washout, with parts of West Yorkshire virtually submerged. In Gorble, 27mm rain fell in an hour.

Sunday saw rare sunny spells in some areas, with families flocking to beaches in Devon to make the most of the brief respite.

While the Leeds and Reading music 
festivals continued despite the downpours, organisers had to cancel the 
Creamfields festival in Daresbury, Cheshire, after the site flooded 
overnight.

It will be disappointing news for 
those hoping for a relatively dry day like yesterday, when 
festival-goers at Reading and Leeds were treated to some sunshine amid the seemingly interminable damp conditions.
