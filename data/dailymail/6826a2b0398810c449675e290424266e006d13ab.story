Karim Benzema says confidence is high for France after an impressive 1-0 win over Spain in their friendly on Thursday.

The Real Madrid striker had a goal wrongly disallowed in the victory at the Stade de France before Chelsea's Loic Remy blasted home the winner in the second half. 

France are excused from Euro 2016 qualifiers as hosts of the tournament and will be confined to friendlies in the lead-up, but Benzema is encouraged by the form of Didier Deschamps' side.

'It's good, it's always nice to win against big teams, especially to do it with style, and we did it tonight,' Benzema told reporters.

'We went head to head with one of the best teams of the world, so it's good for the French team and for our confidence.

'After the World Cup, we needed to start working again and play a big game. We work together, we're a really good team and we just need to keep working.'

Benzema proved a handful for Spain's defence without recording a goal, but didn't seem too bothered given the team's performance.

'I haven't seen the replay, I don't know if I was offside, but I'm starting to get tired of my goals being disallowed,' he said.

'The most important thing is that we won, I had a lot of fun tonight.'
