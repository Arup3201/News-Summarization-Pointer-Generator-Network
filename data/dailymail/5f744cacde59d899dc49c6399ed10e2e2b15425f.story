U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden last night refused to rule out the possibility that he might run for the White House in 2016.

The Democrat - who will turn 74 in the election month of November 2016 - said that his immediate focus is to help President Barack Obama get re-elected in 2012.

But when pressed on the possibility of his own future run, he replied, 'I'm not closing anything.'

Eyeing the prize? Joe Biden, pictured with his wife Jill and daughter Ashley on the campaign trail in 2008, has refused to rule out running for president in 2016

He added: 'My one focus now is getting the president re-elected. That is the focus.

'And I'll make up my mind on that [the 2016 election] later.'

The 68-year-old also said he was in the best shape of his life and was enjoying being in the thick of politics and government.

Mr Biden, who ran for president twice before being chosen by Mr Obama in 2008 as his running mate, is expected to be a key player in the president's re-election effort next year.

Running mate: Mr Biden insisted that his immediate priority is to get Barack Obama re-elected in November 2012

He is known as a people person and Mr 
Obama's political advisers see him as someone who will be particularly 
effective with working-class voters in key East Coast battleground 
states like Pennsylvania and with older voters in states like Florida.

Mr
Biden also has a tendency to make verbal gaffes and stirred controversy
last week when he warned that the number of rapes and murders in U.S. 
cities would climb if states were forced by budget cuts to lay off 
police officers.

The idea of a 74-year-old Joe Biden being inaugurated as U.S. president in 2016 isn't as far fetched as it sounds.

In 1981, Ronald Reagan was inaugurated less than 3 weeks before he turned 70.

Following his re-election in 1984 aged 73, he eventually left office  in January 1989 shortly before turning 78.

More recently, Republican candidate John McCain, 72, was beaten by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race.

In 1996, the-then 73-year-old Bob Dole secured the Republican nomination to challenge Bill Clinton for the presidency.

Critics questioned the statistics behind his comment.

Meanwhile, Mr Obama is today trying to get his re-election campaign back on track as he visits Las Vegas to tout his revised jobs bill.

Mr Obama will stop in Nevada - which has the nation's highest unemployment rate at 13.4 per cent - for a campaign fundraiser at the Bellagio Hotel.

He will then visit a poverty-stricken neighbourhood on the city's far eastern side.

In his four-hour trip, scheduled to take place between 12pm and 4pm local time, he will talk about the American Jobs Act that he has put forward to boost his beleaguered country's economy.

It would see a $447billion combination of fresh spending and tax cuts, offset by tax hikes on the rich.

The American Jobs Act was shelved in the Senate last week and on Friday a plan to finance $35billion for states to stop layoffs to teachers and public safety officers was defeated.

Democrats are now trying to pass a series of actions, to confront housing, education and other economic problems, in segments under the mantra 'We Can't Wait'.

The next segment will be $50billion in funding and a $10billion infrastructure bank to finance roads, bridges, aviation and transit projects.

Mr Obama will kick off his new offensive in Las Vegas by promoting new rules for federally guaranteed mortgages so that more homeowners, those with little or no equity in their homes, can refinance and avert foreclosure.
