An ex-Disney World princess who has played the characters of Pocahontas, Mulan and Silvermist, has submitted herself to an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit.

Kristen Sotakoun, an actress and entertainer who now works on cruise ships, describes her former job warmly as bringing 'unlimited magic feelings forever.' When she wasn't being hit on by kids' older relatives that is.

'I was hit on as Pocahontas more than Mulan or Silvermist, and it definitely has to do with the amount of clothing she's wearing,' Ms Sotakoun writes. 'There's always the family that makes the grandpa or the dad get a picture alone, and they'd whisper how pretty I was, or ask when I got off of work.'

Ms Sotakoun is quick to add that she was never touched 'inappropriately' and that nothing 'ridiculous' ever happened with regards to creepy adults.

The only other downsides of the job, she claims, involved wearing the uncomfortable Mulan costume, which was 'death in the summer,' and the occasional non-believers.

She recalls one party of ten kids, all under the age of eight, who accosted her while she was playing Silvermist the fairy.

'Fly right now!' she remembers them squealing. 'See, she can't! She's a liar! Liarrrr!'

Another little boy confronted her while she was playing Pocahontas - one of the few Disney characters to actually have once existed - and informed her somewhat awkwardly that that he had once visited her grave.

Ms Sotakoun also discusses the rather complex set of steps required to make it as a Disney princess in the first place.

First, contenders have to get through the auditions, then they are trained as 'character performers,' which are non-speaking 'fur characters' like Mickey or Minnie Mouse. Only then can employees be trained for a 'face role,' which means they can interact verbally with visitors.

Ms Sotakoun writes: 'Day one is watching the movie, learning how to walk, talk and act; and day two is meet and greets with guests.' She adds that training takes longer when special accents are required, such as for British characters like Mary Poppins.

She explains that employees are taught how to do their own make-up, which takes an hour or so every day, before being released to delight the children of Disney World for roughly nine-hour shifts.

So many autographs! Ms Sotakoun recalls that there were times she would accidentally sign credit card receipts with 'Mulan'

Many children who were 'dropped' into her lap were too shy to say much, Ms Sotakoun informs her captive internet audience. 'In all honesty, I've had thousands of conversations with people where I'm the only one talking. I'm proud of that,' she remarks.

Of her former colleagues, Ms Sotakoun says they were mostly 'nice,' sometimes 'nasty,' and that the Disney princes were almost always gay. And the fun and games didn't always end when employees stepped behind the curtain and out of character.

'One time in the break room, I saw Cinderella and Snow White fit comfortably under Tiana's dress,' she writes. 'When Belle came around the corner they popped out and scared her.'

Asked if it was sometimes difficult to leave her characters behind her, Ms Sotakoun recalled that indeed, there were times she would accidentally sign receipts with 'Mulan.'
