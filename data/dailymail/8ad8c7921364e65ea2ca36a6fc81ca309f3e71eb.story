From foxes and birds to humpback whales and tigers, these are the incredible model animals created entirely by origami.

Argentine artists Juan Elizade, 31 and 27-year-old Carolina Silvero from Buenos Aires say they have devoted their lives into making the animals using the art of folding paper.

The couple design their creations on computer before cutting and folding them into creatures such as bears, birds and even a 3D park scene.

The couple started out making forest animals such as foxes, pictured, saying that they have always enjoyed nature 

Mr Elizade said: 'We make our animals by looking at a lot of reference to know all the angles and details.

'Then we deign them in 3D software, translate them to be cut in paper in software, and then cut and assemble them in real life.

'Nature was out favourite subject when we decided to start with Guardabosques. We like to experiment a lot and nature is the best excuse.

'Nature is the theme in what we do. We think it is an infinite source of inspiration, morphology, texture, colours, scales, materials, it never ends.

'At the same time, we like to be able to generate awareness to known and take care of all that.

Mr Elizade currently studies in the Argentine ornithology institution while Miss Silvero has worked as a textile print designer.

She added: 'The pieces we enjoy the most are those where we can combine some of the lowpoly animals and objects with some illustrations to make a scene and tell a story.

As well as animals, the couple have also created a park, left, and little paper houses, right, to make a real life scene
