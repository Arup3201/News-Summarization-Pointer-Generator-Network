Juventus and Chile star Arturo Vidal has ruled out a move to Manchester United, according to reports in Italy.

Vidal has been strongly linked with a move away from Turin this summer with Manchester United and Real Madrid among the top clubs keen to acquire the 27-year-old's services.

But when questioned about his future, Vidal said: 'I do not go to Manchester.'

Vidal arrived back in Italy and when asked by reporters whether he would stay at Juventus said: 'I do not go to Manchester. Can I say I will remain with Juve? I don’t know.

'I’ll talk to Allegri on Monday and then we will see. I haven’t spoken with Allegri or any of my team-mates yet, but I’m not going to Manchester.'

Italian newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport also report that Juventus do not want to sell the midfielder - who has three years left on his contract -  but could be tempted by an offer of around €45million (£36m).

Key target: Chile international Vidal had been on Louis van Gaal's summer wish-list

The paper also suggest that Liverpool and Arsenal retain an interest in Vidal.

The news will be a blow to new Manchester United manager Louis 
van Gaal who had been tracking the player and is keen to strengthen his 
midfielder options further having signed Ander Herrera from Athletico 
Bilbao

Vidal moved
 to Juve from Bayer Leverkusen in 2011 and scored 11 goals in 32 league 
appearances to help the Turin giants win their third straight league 
title last season.
