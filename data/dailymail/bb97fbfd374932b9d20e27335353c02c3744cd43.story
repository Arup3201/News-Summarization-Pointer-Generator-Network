An Eton-educated aristocrat who admitted having sex with a schoolgirl within days of her 16th birthday walked smiling from court yesterday after he was cleared of rape.

The Honourable James Murray, 42, second son of the Earl of Mansfield, thanked his family for their ‘unstinting support’ as the tawdry details of his relationship with the troubled foster child were detailed in court.

The girl had claimed that, during one of her many visits to Murray’s flat, he must have spiked her Ribena. She woke to find her tracksuit trousers tugged down to her knees and him naked beside her.

But Murray maintained that she had agreed to sex up to six times and only later ‘cried rape’ after he told her a condom had split and she should take the morning-after pill. Far from him grooming her for sex, he insisted, she had groomed him.

After a week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court, the jury took only 57 minutes to find him not guilty. His brother Alexander, Viscount Stormont and sister Lady Georgina Bullough, who supported him during the trial, exchanged relieved smiles.

Outside court Murray thanked the jury, his legal team and his family. ‘This has been the most difficult 18 months for me, but more particularly for my family who had to endure the brunt of the uncertainty, detail of the allegation and the obvious interest in the case,’ he said.

The court heard that Murray had met 
the youngster, who would habitually play truant and had run away from 
home, when she was 15. At the time, despite his family’s great wealth – 
his father is worth £60million – he was leading a solitary existence 
working as a self-employed IT consultant from his home in a ground-floor
flat in a down-at-heel Oxford suburb.

His family maintained in court that despite his age, Murray was ‘naïve’ and emotionally immature.

Viscount Stormont, 55, said: ‘The family were always confident that Jamie was not guilty of this alleged offence.’

Despite the not guilty verdict, however, grave damage has been done to one of Britain’s most distinguished families.Murray grew up in historic Scone Palace, within a 27,000-acre Perthshire estate with polo grounds, a racecourse and extensive shooting and fishing rights on the Tay.

For many years it housed the Stone of Scone, which was used  for centuries in the coronation of Scottish kings.

Prince Charles was a frequent visitor and Baroness Thatcher is a friend of Murray’s 81-year-old father and his wife Pamela, Countess of Mansfield, 76.

The earl was a minister of state in the Scottish and Northern Ireland offices during the Thatcher years.

Today, the running of the palace is left to Viscount Stormont, while Lady Georgina, 44, is a deputy lieutenant of Perth.

As for their brother…well, he was 
once placed third in a newspaper poll of Scotland’s 100 most eligible 
men. But behind his glamorous image, chronicled in society magazines and
newspaper diary columns back in the nineties, he was always the black 
sheep of the family.

This is exemplified by an incident 
when he was about 16 and Lady Thatcher, or Mrs Thatcher as she was then,
called on the earl and countess. 

Troubled: The flat in Oxford where the girl, who is now 17, used to visit James Murray with her friends to drink, smoke and play music

Privilege: Historic Scone Palace, Perthshire, Scotland, where James Murray grew up

Murray was banished from the house, it seems, and made to sit in a police van outside for the duration of the Prime Minister’s visit.

The reason, apparently, was revealed by a police officer who ‘stood guard’ over him that day: ‘Nothing was expressly said, but we got the distinct impression that he could not be trusted to behave in company.’

After leaving school with few qualifications, he spent a number of years travelling and, at one time or another, was a sheep farmer and lumberjack in Australia.

His bizarre early employment record since then is listed on his Facebook page and includes: cleansing operative (Scotland), ‘financial persuader’ (London), ‘Alcohol marketing’ (also London).

Along the way, it emerged in court, he picked up two convictions for drug possession and one for drink driving.

The earl thanked his parents, Lord and Lady Mansfield for their support during the trial

Convictions aside, it was a lifestyle unlikely to have impressed his father, a barrister, who has encouraged his children to ‘make their own way’ in life. That is perhaps why, aged 30, Murray enrolled on a computer course at Oxford Brookes University, formerly Oxford Polytechnic.

Shortly afterwards, he set himself up as a freelance computer engineer in the city.

His most recent address was a new rented two-bedroom flat in the suburbs, splitting his time between Oxford and Perth.

Although he is not the eldest son, he has few financial worries.

He is listed as a director (with his siblings) of a family-owned property company, which according to the latest accounts, has funds of £2.6million and cash reserves  of £1.7million.

And he conforms to an all too familiar stereotype. ‘I think he could quite fairly be described as a bit of a “Hooray Henry”,’ says someone who bumped into him at a party back in Perth recently.

‘He was loud and lairy – living it up and going around with a bottle of champagne. I saw him pointing to a photographer and saying, “You there! Take my picture!”.’

In Oxford, Murray would casually drop his gilded background into the conversation, once telling a neighbour that he had to go back to ‘the palace’ in Scotland as ‘Prince Charles was coming to visit’.

‘We thought, “Goodness, he must be posh”,’ recalled a woman who lived in the same block.

‘He then showed me a photograph of his “house”. He said he really did live there and they had loads of servants.’

Shortly after Murray’s arrest, youngsters went on the rampage in the block where he lived, breaking windows, throwing paint over his car and spraying graffiti.

He was asked to leave by the managing agents who discovered he had given a key to the teenage girl he was accused of assaulting.

For the past year, he has been living with his sister at her turreted mansion not far from Scone Palace. A sign at the end of the driveway warns visitors: ‘Keep off the grass and dead slow. Children, Dogs, Hens, Bikes, Helicopters’.
