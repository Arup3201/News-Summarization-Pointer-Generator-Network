Heather Mack, the pregnant teenager on trial in Bali charged with murdering her mother, was rushed to hospital from her prison today.

Sources inside Kerobokan Jail told the Daily Mail Online the 19-year-old prisoner had collapsed with stomach pain and had started bleeding.

According to a prison source, Miss Mack cried out in pain at lunch time and after a check by the prison doctor it was decided she needed immediate hospital treatment. 

She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated. 

Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood.

Co-defendent: Her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer is jointly charged with the murder of Sheila von Wiese-Mack

But her condition was regarded as serious enough for an ambulance to be called to take her quickly to hospital. 

The US teenager is not expecting her baby daughter - which she has named Stella - for another two months.

Mack her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside a suitcase. If convicted the pair could be killed by firing squad.  

A spokesman at Bali's Sanglah Hospital later said: 'She has not lost the baby. The baby is alright.'

She was expected to remain in hospital overnight and perhaps longer.

Once given the all clear, Miss Mack will be returned to her cell at Kerobokan prison to await the next hearing in her murder trial, scheduled for next week.

Miss Mack has been receiving help from two women volunteers who have been buying food for her and taking it to the jail to supplement the basic rice and vegetables that Kerobokan provides to inmates.

She has revealed that she intends to keep the child with her in her cell - which she is sharing with up to 10 other women.

Prisoners who give birth are allowed to keep their babies for two years, after which the youngsters have to be passed to local carers or to relatives. 

The court was shown the suitcase that Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was allegedly found stuffed inside, along with a set of blood stained sheets

However, it has been reported by women visiting the jail that they have learned the other women in Miss Mack's cell are not happy about her raising a child in their presence.

The other prisoners have reportedly complained that a young baby will keep them awake.

On Thursday she reportedly made a desperate phone call to a US judge  because she had no Indonesian attorney to represent her.

In addition her US lawyer withdrew from the case over a 'breakdown in communication,' according to the Chicago Tribune.

The pair have pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder and their cases are being tried separately in the Denpasar District Court in Bali.

As Mack's trial got underway, the strain was visible on her face as she followed proceedings through an Indonesian interpreter.

When the silver-coloured suitcase in which the folded body of Sheila Von-Wiese Mack is alleged to have been placed was shown to the three judges, it was revealed that her Indonesian lawyer had received only a part-payment from the trust fund.

Within hours, Mack's US civil attorney Anthony Scifo, filed a motion to voluntarily withdraw from her case, citing a 'substantial breakdown in communication,' the Tribune reported.

The paper said that in three phone calls, a woman claiming to be Mack, told a law clerk in the office of Cook County judge Neil Cohen she needed help. 

The judge had previously said she could use some of the money her murdered mother has left in a trust fund for her.

Mack reportedly said she had fired her attorneys and explained that she currently has no attorneys and doesn't know how to speak to the judge, the law clerk said in a written statement read to the Cook County court.

'She asked how she could get another attorney to represent her or to speak to the (Cook County) judge,' the Tribune reported the clerk as telling the court.

'I told her that I could not give her legal advice and the conversation ended.'

But in a third call, the woman claiming to be Mack 'mentioned that she was in Indonesia and has no money, no-one to call and no attorneys and doesn't know what to do.'

Bali lawyer Ary Soenardi said that he was still acting for her and was continuing to work on her defence.

A court spokesman in Bali said no notification had been given that he had removed himself from the case, which has been adjourned until next week.

It is then that the first of the prosecution witnesses will be called.

Among the witness will be staff from the St Regis Hotel - where the murder occurred - police and forensic experts.

Ahead of the start of the trial against her Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' 

She said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune.

If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 

'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying.

She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression.

‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’

But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy.

Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ 

Mack also revealed that she believed her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’

Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out.

They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. 

The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials.

They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua.

They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. 

Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. 

In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000.

They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle.

Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. 

They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged.
