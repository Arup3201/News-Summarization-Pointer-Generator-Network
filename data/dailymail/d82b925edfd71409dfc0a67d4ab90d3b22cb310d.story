Karie Murphy's teenage son Ryan was apparently signed up to vote in Falkirk, where she was standing for election, while he was actually living with his father in Glasgow

The Unite union is today facing an explosive new vote-rigging scandal after the son of a woman it fiercely backed to become an MP was apparently signed up to vote for her.

The teenage son of Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, was said to be living in Falkirk, where she was fighting a battle for Unite to seize control of a Labour safe seat.

In fact, Ryan Cullen lived in Glasgow with his father, from whom Miss Murphy is separated.

He is registered on the electoral roll as living in the city, where he works and, until recently, went to school.

In the run up to his mother’s vote, he was enrolled as a Labour Party member using the addresses of two rental properties in Falkirk, which would have enabled him to vote for her.

However, the owners of the properties have no record of him ever living there.

At the time, Miss Murphy, 49, and her allies at Unite recruited new members who they apparently could count on to vote for her to be Labour’s prospective MP.

In an apparent bid to manipulate the selection up to 112 membership documents were allegedly falsified, residents were signed up without their consent and signatures forged.

Complaints of corruption sparked a police investigation and a Labour probe, which was called off in September by Ed Miliband, who claimed no evidence of wrongdoing had been found.

The revelation that Miss Murphy’s own family were among those recruited to Labour – the most damning evidence of electoral corruption in Falkirk to date and a clear breach of party rules – comes as the Labour Party leader faces increasing pressure to reopen investigations into the scandal, which he has repeatedly refused to do.

Mr Cullen, who turned 18 in September, has been signed up to the Labour Party in Falkirk for over a year. In that time, he has been registered as living at two rental properties in the town.

However, on the electoral roll he is listed as living in the Glasgow suburb Cambuslang with his father William Cullen.

According to the Labour Party, it is an ‘abuse of party rules’ to recruit members who do not live at their claimed addresses and all members must sign up at properties where they are listed on the electoral roll.

On his social networking profiles, Mr Cullen declares that he lives in Glasgow, and the owners and agents of the Falkirk rental properties have no record of his ever having lived there. None of them recognised a picture of Mr Cullen or had heard his name before.

Miss Murphy’s niece Michelle Crockert, 21, was also signed up at one of the addresses in Falkirk even though she, too, lives and works in Glasgow, where she is registered to vote.

Her boyfriend told the Daily Mail: ‘Michelle did have her name down. Her and Ryan. [But] they were not living together. She has always lived here [in Glasgow]. Ryan stays with his dad.’

The Mail spoke to Miss Crockert last week at her home in Glasgow. She did not refute the allegations about her false address in Falkirk, but said: ‘I’m not going to give you any information at all. I don’t want to discuss this. I’m not telling you anything.’

The address where she and Mr Cullen were listed appears to have been carefully selected because it is just inside the parliamentary constituency but also sits within the boundaries of the neighbouring Falkirk East area for the purposes of Scottish elections.

Miss Murphy’s close friend and Unite’s main organiser in the town Stevie Deans was expected to run for the Scottish Parliament in Falkirk East next year – so their supposed false address would have allowed them to vote for both Miss Murphy and Mr Deans.

Last night Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These allegations are extremely serious. Faced with this new evidence, Ed Miliband must re-open the inquiry into the Falkirk scandal.’

Labour said it was ‘prepared to examine the new evidence’ but would not be drawn on whether the inquiry would be reopened.

A spokesman added: ‘We have taken action to ensure no one who joined the Party after Eric Joyce resigned can take part in the selection of a new candidate.

Karie Murphy has already withdrawn as a candidate, the UnionJoin scheme has been abolished and Ed Miliband has embarked on the biggest reform of the party in a generation.’

Unite and Miss Murphy declined to comment.
