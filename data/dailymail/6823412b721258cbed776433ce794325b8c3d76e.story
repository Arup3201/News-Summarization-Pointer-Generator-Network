An elderly man deployed six homemade cannons around his home to prevent it from being demolished.

Zhou Jianbang set the dummy weapons up after watching neighbours’ houses torn down allegedly without consent.

Mr Zhou insisted his cannons would not have caused any harm and civil police in Xingyang, Henan, central China, confirmed he had not broken any laws.

Zhou Jianbang set up six dummy cannons outside his property fearing it could be demolished by officials

Each costing 100 yuan (around £10), Zhou deployed the cannons to protect his home when he became insecure, according to ECNS.

But a local official said they did not plan on demolishing the house and insisted this would not be done until an agreement had been reached.

The community is being relocated, and just 34 of 340 households are allowed to stay.

Some of those moved on said they had been offered compensation and resettlement.

Others claimed they did not have a paper agreement.

One 85-year-old resident, Feng Baosen, said his house was demolished two months ago without his knowledge.

Feng claimed the government gave them 4,000 yuan  (£400) and did not concern themselves with the relocation.

The government said all demolitions were agreed to by residents.

The cannons cost 100 yuan (around £10) each to build

Civil police in the Henan district confirmed Mr Zhou had not broken any laws setting up the cannon
