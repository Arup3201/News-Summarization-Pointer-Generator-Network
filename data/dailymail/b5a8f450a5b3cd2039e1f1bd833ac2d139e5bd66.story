They come from across America: they are blonde, brunette, pageant queens, models, actresses, single moms and even medics.

But the one thing they all have in common is a love of Prince Harry - and they seem desperate to become the 'spare' heir's wife. Of course, the royal they hope to snag is - supposedly unbeknown to them - not the real Harry at all but a dashing lookalike.

Now MailOnline can reveal the 12 real-life ladies wooed by a true 'pretender' to the throne on I Wanna Marry Harry, the new Fox reality show set to air May 27.

However, just how much they were actually duped is in question, as many are happily promoting themselves ahead of the program's launch  - and seem far from upset over the stunt.

I Wanna Marry Harry: The new Fox reality show, created by Zig Zag Productions in the UK and produced by Ryan Seacrest, airs on May 20

Meghan Jones, 26, originally from Tustin, CA, but now living in Dallas, Texas, is a wedding planner.

The blonde dated Bachelor star Jake Pavelka after his bitter split from fiancée Vienna Girardi in June 2010 - and was by his side when he appeared in ABC's Dancing With The Stars later that year.

Jake, 36, a trained pilot, told how he planned to fly Meghan around the world and boasted the couple were taking Latin dancing lessons. But the couple broke up in 2010.

Carley Hawkins, 24, is originally from Buffalo, Missouri. but she now works as a special needs assistant in a school in Phoenix, Arizona. She is fond of posting modelling pictures online as well.

Maggie Toraason, 25, is from Chicago, Illinois, and works as a customer account representative.

She is clearly fun-loving and has posted pictures of herself on nights out, including lounging in the back of a limo while clutching a beer.

On April 20, she posted a picture on her Twitter account of a billboard of I Wanna Marry Harry up in Times Square.

And far from potentially being upset at being 'duped' by the fake Prince Harry, Maggie has excitedly posted other adverts for the show and re-tweeted producer Ryan Seacrest, while asking her followers 'What did everyone think of the promo!?'

Andrea Fox, 25, from Longview, Texas, is a pageant girl. She already bills herself as 'Star on I Wanna Marry Harry on Fox' in May.

After posting a picture of the Times Square billboard in New York, she noted: 'So this is what it feels like to be on a billboard in Times Square!!!! Y'all can't tell me anything right now. #Cloud9'

And she excitedly linked to a story on MailOnline, tweeting: 'Made it on the Daily Mail, can you spot me?!'

Jacqueline Conroy, 24, from Lynbrook, NY, has been busy promoting I Wanna Marry Harry to all her friends.

She joked: 'Thought the name of the show was going to be "Who wants to marry an American Idiot"...silly us. Looking forward to reliving this experience nationally, starting on May 27th, 8PM on Fox ... You won't want to miss it!!

Kimberly Birch, 24, is an actress from Malverne, NY. She worked with and was close friends with Jacqueline Conroy before the show.
