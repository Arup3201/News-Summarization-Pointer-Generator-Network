One patient played chess, watched movies and checked their emails during a nine-and-a-half hour hip replacement operation

A NHS trust has been criticised for a plan to install iPads into operating theatres, allowing patients to watch movies, play chess or check their emails while being operated on.

The pilot scheme, which could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, could cost taxpayers more than £18,000 if funded by the NHS.

In a pilot trial, patients at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford have watched their 
favourite films, surfed the net and checked their emails during 10 hour local anaesthetic surgeries.

The pilot scheme is hoped to help distract people from often lengthy regional anaesthetic surgery, which requires absolute stillness.

However, Dia Chakravarty, political director at The Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will wonder if this really is the best use of their money when necessary savings are having to be made across the public sector.

'People expect their taxes to pay for doctors and cancer drugs.

'The trust's decision to spend money on iPads will leave hard-pressed families wondering if the trust has got its priorities right.'

One of the first patients to try the scheme watched a film, checked emails and played chess during a nine-and-a-half-hour hip replacement and lower limb orthoplastic surgery.

With the lowest range iPad retailing at £399, purchasing enough iPads to cover each of the trust's operating theatres would cost £18,354.

However, the trust has not specified what sort of tablet would be used if it were to go ahead on a larger scale.

The idea 
of using an iPad during surgery came from consultant anaesthetists 
Svetlana Galitzine and James Matthews for limb surgery patients.

They
 read research that found patients preferred being kept awake as it 
improved recovery times, but needed some sort of distraction to keep 
them relaxed.

The
 iPad used for the trial was mounted on a docking unit, which also comes
 with headphones, meaning patients can have the screen adjusted for 
comfort.

Dr 
Galitzine said: 'Many patients can feel anxious at being conscious 
during an operation, so we are pleased that we have been able to develop
 a way of making that experience less stressful.

'We
 are currently assessing patients’ experiences with this technique and 
finalising patients’ preoperative information leaflets which can help 
them to make informed choice.

'Most
 operations can be done under local or regional anaesthetic, as long as 
the kit is available and the patient, anaesthetist and the surgeon agree
 to use this technique.

'Feedback from patients so far has been very positive.'

Trust spokesman Martin Leaver said: 'This is in the very early stages, but we think we are the first in the country to try it.'
