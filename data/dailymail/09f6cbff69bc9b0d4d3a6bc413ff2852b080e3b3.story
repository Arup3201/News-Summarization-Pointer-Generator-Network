On trial: Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev is facing charges for punching a man on TV in 2011

Media magnate Alexander Lebedev faces 
trial in Moscow tomorrow over a notorious TV punch as the tycoon he 
struck is set to return to Russia from a Cambodian prison.

Lebedev, 53, whose family own several 
British newspapers, faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of a 
controversial charge of politically-motivated ‘hooliganism’ in striking 
Sergei Polonsky during a Russian television talk show.

Polonsky was held for three months in 
detention in Cambodia on an unrelated matter, before being allowed out 
on a reported $50,000 USD bail pending a court case where he faces 
charges of kidnapping a group of sailors at knifepoint and forcing them 
to jump overboard into the sea. 

Despite tough bail curbs imposed by 
the court, it has emerged that Polonsky was in Switzerland for ‘four or 
five days’ last week, and now wants to return to Russia just as Ledebev 
goes on trial.

His exact whereabouts currently are not known.

‘He may attend the trial but this is 
not the most important thing for him,’ said business associate Sergei 
Vladi.

‘He has important business matters to resolve.’

Vladi did not know if real estate 
tycoon Polonsky, 40, jumped bail or made an arrangement with the 
Cambodian authorities to leave.

‘I am not sure if he got this 
permission,’ he said.

The Lebedev case, due to start on 
Tuesday, is seen by some analysts as a blatant crackdown by the Russian 
state on press freedom since the billionaire co-owns leading 
investigative title, Novaya Gazeta, which regularly exposes corruption 
in high places.

Polonsky, whose evidence would be 
crucial to a Lebedev conviction, last week posted on Facebook that he 
was in Pregny-Chambesy, near Geneva. A photograph appeared to confirm 
this.

A Cambodian official expressed 
surprise at the claim and a police source in Phnom Penh said they were 
‘seeking to establish his whereabouts’.

His lawyer Kong Radi said: ‘The
last time I saw him was on 3 April. We haven't been in touch since.’

Asked about reports he had fled 
Cambodia, his Russian lawyer Alexander Dobrovinsky said last week: ‘I 
know about that, but I cannot comment.’

He said that Polonsky had posted bail of $50,000 in Cambodia, where he owns a private island including a five star hotel.

Earlier, there was speculation that 
Polonsky might make a surprise appearance in person as the key state 
witness in the trial of Lebedev, who claims he threw the punch in self 
defence, and believes he is the victim of a 'McCathyite' witchhunt by 
Russian investigators.

Polonsky is known to have given a 
written statement to prosecutors on Lebedev's 2011 punch that knocked 
him off his chair during a TV debate on the economy, and until now 
prosecutors said that did did not need to be in court in person.

If Polonsky does appear in Moscow this week, it could all change.

Following his arrest in Cambodia on 30
December, Polonsky was held in detention in  Sihanoukville jail  until 
his release on 29 March.

It is understood pressure from Russian officials was crucial to a judge bailing him.

Once a billionaire, Polonsky has lost 
key parts of his business and is likely to face legal challenges in 
Russia. Last week there were claims that he had sold a business for $100
million.

Polonsky faces up to three years jail 
if convicted in Cambodia even though the six sailors withdrew their 
complaint against him after a $20,000 USD payment to the men by the 
tycoon.
