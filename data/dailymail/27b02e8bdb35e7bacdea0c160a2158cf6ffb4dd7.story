House of Lords restaurants lost almost £2million last year – leaving ordinary taxpayers to pick up the bill.

The upper chamber’s controversial catering subsidy increased by £100,000 last year according to official figures released this week.

The lavish subsidy allows peers to enjoy fine-dining at knock-down prices on the Parliamentary estate. 

Parliamentary authorities insiste that bills have been reduced by hundreds of thousands and prices in bars and restaurants have been increased to reduce the burden on the public purse

Overall, the taxpayer subsidy for the eight House of Lords bars and restaurants jumped from £1.85m to £1.95m between 2012/13 to 2013/14. The Peers' Dining Room alone required £886,996 of taxpayers’ money to keep going.

The revelation has infuriated MPs, battling to win back public trust in Parliament after the expenses scandal.

Labour MP John Mann said the House of Lords was ‘the most lavish retirement home in the country’.

He said: ‘It is about time the Lords was cut down in size. I would abolish the whole house, but if they are not going to do that they should at least cut its cloth so it is in touch with the rest of austerity Britain.’

John O'Connell, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, added: ‘David Cameron promised that the cost of politics would come down, but it is still far too high.

‘Taxpayers shouldn't be subsidising fancy catering in the House of Lords when we're trying to find savings everywhere else. It's absurd that this practice has survived in these tough financial times.’

The Lords catering subsidy allows peers to enjoy lavish meals far below the price ordinary families would have to pay elsewhere in central London.

In the exclusive Barry Room brasserie, peers can enjoy 'Prawn and lobster meat folded into Avugar caviar' with 'lemon mayonnaise, with tomato and cucumber salsa and grilled baby gem lettuce' for just £10.

They can then dine on 'Squid ink linguine, served with sautéed mixed shellfish, roasted red peppers coulis, mixed with lemon and flat leaf parsley topped with parmesan shavings' for £9.

Or if they prefer meat, peers can choose a 'grilled breast of guinea fowl, served with café au lait, sautéed kale and parsnip crisps' for £9.50 or a grilled minute steak for £10.

A House of Lords spokesman said the upper chamber had cut its catering subsidy by 27 per cent since 2007 and said it was their aim ‘to halve the net cost of the catering and retail service by 2015/16’.

He added: 'Our catering services meet the needs of a working House of Parliament and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the House, and periods where the House doesn’t sit and so revenue is not generated, a subsidy is unavoidable.

'We also pay all staff at least the London Living Wage and provide workplace pensions to our refreshment department staff. We are proud to do so but it means our costs are higher than some commercial restaurants.’

But it is not only the Lords which benefit from taxpayer subsidised dinners. 

Before MPs broke off for Christmas they enjoyed lavish lunches – including chargrilled partridge, salmon marinated in vodka and guinea fowl for the same price as a high street pizza.

The meals are able to be offered for way below the going rate because taxpayers subsidise restaurant and bars across the Parliamentary estate.

The Strangers' Dining Room - used by members to wine and dine guests - is serving chargrilled spatchcocked partridge with roast pear, squash and game chips for £9.25.

Just a mile away from Parliament, ordinary members of the public have to pay £25 to dine on a roast leg of Partridge.

Another seasonal item at the restaurant is the roast Norfolk turkey breast wrapped in smoked pancetta with piccolo parsnips, baby sprouts, chestnut stuffing, cranberry gel and bread sauce foam for £12.

The fish menu includes confit halibut with lemon verbena, Anna potatoes, baby fennel, golden raisins and verjus for £15.

In the Portcullis Cafeteria main courses include braised guinea fowl breast with baked fig and celeriac rosti with ginger sauce for £4 and baked fillet of salmon in puff pastry with a rich tomato sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil for £4.

MPs have been urged to end the £7million a year subsidy for food and drink in the House of Commons

At the Debate restaurant Christmas specials include grilled salmon fillet marinated in vodka and dill with vegetable tinsel for £4.

The Churchill Dining Room offers salt-baked celeriac with pea velouté, poached hen's egg, puffed potato, toasted panko and popcorn shoots for £10.

Parliamentary staff can also make use of the daily roast at the Members' Dining Room, where the fare includes traditional roast turkey with stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce and mustard and honey glazed gammon with parsley sauce and sage and onion pudding. 

Peers were last month attacked after it emerged they had complained that their exclusive restaurants had become 'downmarket'.

Members of the House of Lords are said to be angry that ordinary office workers with a Parliamentary pass are now allowed to join them at their taxpayer-subsidised dining areas.

Lords catering officials allowed other people into the dining hall to cut the eye-watering subsidy.

The exclusive Barry Room was turned into a brasserie where ordinary workers can now bring up to six guests.

But one diner was left unimpressed – firing off a complaint against the 'downgrading' of the restaurants and 'the appalling search for mediocrity'.

Other complaints — revealed under Freedom of Information rules — attacked the quality of food and angry staff.

One lord said he could get better food in a 'down market establishment like Prezzo or Ask'.

Another suggested the chef who had made a mushroom roll 'should be sent to Pizza Express or Zizzi and probably Cafe Rouge'.

One peer even complained he would get a better-value breakfast for £36 at London's five-star Ritz Hotel.
