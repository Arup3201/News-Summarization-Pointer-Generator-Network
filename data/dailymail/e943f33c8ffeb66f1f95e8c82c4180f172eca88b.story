Detroit Lions tight end - and self-described touchdown dancer extraordinaire - Joseph Fauria set tongues wagging Monday when he fired off a cryptic tweet alluding to his girlfriend’s alleged tryst with another football player.

Fauria's message to his 37,300 fans, which has since been deleted, read: 'Hey @DangeRussWilson enjoy her @ErikaAnnHammond. She had me thinking she was a loyal GF. I almost feel you @BrennanClay24 #SprayTan'

The 24-year-old Lions star has been dating model and former WWE NXT Diva Erika Hammond.

Keeping mum: Fauria, No 80, has not commented on the allegations of infidelity beyond his Twitter message

If Fauria's tweet, reported on by the New York Post, is to be believed, the striking 24-year-old brunette left him for Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.

The last line in the tweet was in reference to another NFL love triangle that set the Twitter-sphre ablaze last week involving Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray.

Murray, 26, has been accused of breaking up the marriage of his former college teammate Brennan Clay, 22, who posted online raunchy text messages allegedly exchanged between his wife, Gina D'Agostini, and the Cowboys player.

On Thursday, the former University of Oklahoma Sooners player took to Twitter claiming that his unfaithful spouse had saved his rival's phone number under the nickname 'Spay Tan.'

Clay responded to Joseph Fauria's tweet Monday by writing: 'SWERVE ON THESE ..... well you know ..' - an apparent reference to the foul-mouthed phrase 'swerve on these h***s.'

Russell Wilson, who has earned a reputation as a devout Christian and a positive role model in the much-maligned league, began divorce proceedings against his wife, Ashton Meem, back in April after two years of marriage.

A short time later, rumors began circulating that Ashton Meem had an affair with Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who has since gone to play for the Detroit Lions - Joseph Fauria's team.

The 24-year-old tight end for the Lions has made a name for himself in the NFL for his over-the-top touchdown celebrations.

During Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Fauria launched into a brief yet boisterous twerking routine that did Miley Cyrus proud.

Just hours before Fauria fired off his toxic tweet publicly accusing his girlfriend of infidelity, Ms Hammond retweeted a message containing a Vine video showing her boyfriend twerking in slow motion, accompanied by the Kim Kardashian-inspired caption: '@BigJoeFauria BREAK THE INTERNET!!'

Neither Hammond not Fauria has commented on the alleged cheating scandal as of Monday afternoon.
