A luxury private jet that used to belong to Osama bin Laden's family has been impounded by police in Florida amid accusations of theft and fraud.

The 22-seater Gulfstream II plane, valued at $4.5million, is stuck on the tarmac at Miami Executive airport while its new owners do battle in court.

Jose Avelino Goncalves, 49, a Venezuelan, has been accused making off with the plane after holding back more than $3million of what he agreed to pay a business partner for it.

Bin grounded: This plane, which used to belong to Osama bin Laden's family, has been grounded in Miami amid a legal dispute between subsequent owners

Suspect: Jose Goncalves, 45, is accused of agreeing to buy the plane then not paying up. It was owned by the family of Osama bin Laden (right) until 1980

Officers in Miami-Dade county have taken custody of the corporate vehicle, the Miami Herald reported.

The Gulfstream II is a staple of international luxury travel, which rich businessmen often kit out with lavish interiors.

Ownership records show that the plane belonged to the billionaire Bin Laden clan until 1980.

At that point, Osama is thought to have just graduated from university in Saudi Arabia, and was still years away from founding al-Qaeda.

His elder half-brother, Salem bin Laden, was then head of the family, which made its fortune from oil.

It has changed owners more than a dozen times since then - complicated by the fact that foreigners are not allowed to own U.S. planes directly, so often register them under companies.

The jet was recently owned by Luis Enrique Nuñez-Villanueva, a former business partner of Goncalves, who is now suing him over it.

State prosecutors, who are also trying Goncalves on fraud and theft charges, say he agreed to buy the plane from Nuñez-Villanueva for $4.5million.

Goncalves allegedly agreed to pay $1.5million up-front for it, and make monthly payments of $500,000 until the balance was covered.

But it is claimed he only ever paid $829,196.

Goncalves's lawyers, however, have characterized the spat as a 'misunderstanding' and say Nuñez- Villanueva took the $829,196 unlawfully to buy himself a helicopter.

Goncalves is being held in Miami on a $4.5million bond during the trial, as prosecutors fear he could flee the country is left to go free. He is also wanted in Venezuela.
