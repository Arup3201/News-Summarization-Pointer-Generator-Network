A fantasist may have started the fire that killed his partner’s two-year-old daughter because he wanted to act the hero, an inquest heard yesterday.

Terry Webb, a lorry driver who posed as a battle-hardened Army veteran, sprinted to the scene when flames from a barn fire engulfed a van in which Isobel Dobson and her one-year-old sister Sarah were sitting.

He unfastened the belt on Sarah’s baby seat and pulled her through a window to safety. But when he tried to reach Isobel, the heat was too intense and the vehicle exploded with her trapped inside.

Tragedy: Two-year-old Isobel Dobson died after a fire started in a Transit van parked at her mother's farm near Pontefract, West Yorkshire

The tragedy occurred in September 
2011 as Mr Webb, 39, helped the girls’ mother Stacey Catch tend a 
friend’s horse at a farm near Pontefract, West Yorkshire.

A police investigation produced a shocking theory, said coroner David Hinchliff.

‘There is a belief Mr Webb perhaps 
didn’t want to harm the children but may have deliberately started the 
fire to rescue them and therefore in everybody’s eyes be a hero.’

Accusation: Stacey Catch told an inquest into her daughter's death that she believed her boyfriend Terry Webb may have started the blaze deliberately

Mr Webb had returned to the Transit 
van to check on the children shortly before the vehicle and a barn 
packed with hay went up in flames.

He was the only one nearby and 
experts believe the blaze was started by a naked flame being held next 
to hay, the inquest in Wakefield heard.

The plan ‘went drastically wrong’ as 
he ‘wouldn’t have appreciated’ how quickly and fiercely the fire would 
take hold, Mr Hinchliff said.

He asked Miss Catch, 24, whether she believed this explanation. She replied ‘I do believe that’s a possibility.’

Miss Catch told of her bizarre relationship with fantasist Mr Webb, from whom she has since split.

She had been married to Isobel’s father Andrew Dobson, who was in the Royal Engineers, but they separated.

She met Mr Webb, a married father of two living in the Isle of Wight, through an internet dating site.

He moved to West Yorkshire to live with Miss Catch in January 2010 after they had met only once.

Miss Catch soon discovered she was 
pregnant with Sarah, but Mr Webb was not the father. However, the couple
told everyone he was.

Blaze: Firefighters were unable to save the two-year-old before she was killed by the fire

Terror: But Miss Catch admitted her own partner Terry Webb could have been responsible for the fire

Mr Webb insisted the baby, born in 
July 2010, was named after his sister who he said had been murdered. 
This was ‘nonsense’, the inquest heard.

Mr Webb claimed he had served for 16 years in the Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia.

He wanted to be a ‘brave soldier 
rather than a boring ordinary man from the Isle of Wight who drives 
lorries’, Mr Hinchliff said.

Aftermath: Police investigated the burnt-out van where Izzy and her sister Sarah had been at the time

Investigation: An inquest is now under way into the circumstances of Izzy's tragic death

Miss Catch said Mr Webb eventually 
confessed his Army career was a fantasy but kept up the pretence to her 
family and even to paramedics and a police officer after the fire.

After they and the baby were taken to 
hospital for treatment, she asked Mr Webb: ‘Did you have anything to do 
with it?’ She said he replied: ‘No’.

Mr Webb was arrested on suspicion of 
murder and attempted murder. A file was sent to the Crown Prosecution 
service but he has not been charged. The inquest continues.

Tribute: A relative's memorial to the toddler left at the site where she died in the fire

Claims: Mr Webb has been accused of deliberately starting the fire to prove himself a hero
