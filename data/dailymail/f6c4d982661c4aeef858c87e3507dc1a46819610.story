House music legend Richie Hawtin pushed a speaker onto an iPhone-wielding fan over the weekend during his performance at Time Warp US.

In a video posted by a fan, Hawtin is seen pushing the speaker on the girl after he sees her recording his performance on her iPhone.

The push is deliberate, and after the girl is taken down by the speaker, Hawtin is seen laughing and dancing as fans are heard gasping.

The girl reportedly suffered no injuries and Hawtin took to Facebook Monday to apologize to the fan.

Hawtin wrote that his intention was not to harm the girl, but simply to get her to stop filming. 

He wrote: 'I was as surprised as I'm sure she was when it moved the way it did and the top speaker fell off of the stack. For that, I'm extremely sorry and embarrassed about what happened.'
