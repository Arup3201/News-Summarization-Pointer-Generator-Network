A North Beach, Maryland man died while hanging Christmas decorations for a 'Winter Wonderland' he built for his four year old daughter and girlfriend he planned to marry.

Jason Byrnes, 34, asked his neighbor Lindsay Schrama if he could decorate her home because it sat on Walnut Avenue near the road where cars and trucks pass by. Schrama, who teaches Byrnes yoga, agreed to let him transform her home into a Christmas palace.

Byrnes had already strung most of the lights on the inflatable elves, on the backyard playhouse, and on a tree that he planned to propose beneath.

However, On December 16. he decided to make some adjustments that would cost him his life. He brought an extension ladder to Schrama's house and accidentally hit a power line above his neigbors house in North Beach, reports the Capital Gazette.

Byrnes' 4-year-old daughter Lily didn't see her father die. She Played with Schrama's children as Schrama tried CPR. Schrama took Lily to a neighbors house when the ambulances arrived.

'Where's daddy?' Lily kept asking.

Schrama searched for her words but told Lily that her father was with the doctor.

'you're not going to make sense of this. There is no sense. It was a freak accident, said Schrama to the Capital Gazzete.

Lily stayed with Schrama's children that night until her mother and Byrne's parents came the next day to pick her up.

After Byrnes died, friends told Lauren Billodeaux of Virginia's Northern neck that Byrnes had planned to propose to her beneath the shining decorations. He met Lauren Billodeaux in the fall. The couple hiked together and fished together.A month after meeting Billodeaux, he chose a diamond ring.

Billodeaux told friends she would have said yes to marrying Jason Bynes.

'He was full-throttle,' she said. 'He didn't know how to halfway love.'

Byrnes was a loving and dedicated father to his 4-year-old daughter Lily as well. He sometimes served her cupcakes for breakfast and a friend recounted that once Lily got her face painted like a butterfly at the zoo and Byrnes got his face painted like a tiger.

Lily, who lives with her mother in Texas, arrived to spend the Holidays with her father. He built the 'Winter Wonderland' for her.

He was also an appreciated neighbor. In addition to offering to decorate Schrama's home, he taught his neighbor's sons how to fish.

He told his neighbor Schrama, 'They're going to see these lights from Mars.'

Schrama and her husband considered turning off the lights after Byrne's death but they don't know how to turn the timer off.

They decided to let the lights shine every evening in memory of Jason Byrnes.

Byrnes who was a mechanic who worked in Hanover for Liebherr Equipment Source, which rents contsruction equipment. He came to the neighboorhood in the spring to fish the chesapeake, walk his terrier Jack, and to love those around him  'full throttle' until the moment he died.
