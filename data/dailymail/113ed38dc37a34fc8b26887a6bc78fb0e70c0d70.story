A 19-year-old school girl gave birth in a bathroom stall at her high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on Tuesday and then attempted to flush the fetus down the toilet.

Cherlie Lefleur discarded the male fetus into a trash can in the bathroom at McCaskey East High School after failing to flush it away.

Investigators have yet to determine if the fetus was stillborn or born alive; an autopsy showed it was 27 to 29 weeks.

Lefleur has been charged with concealing the death of a child.

She was arraigned Wednesday night by District Judge Joshua R. Keller and committed to Lancaster County Prison in lieu of $1 million bail, reports LancasterOnline.

A custodian found the fetus around 10 p.m. Tuesday.Â 

On Wednesday, detectives conducted interviews and reviewed video footage, identifying Lefleur as the mother.

An infant born at 27 to 29 weeks is
very premature but with the correct medical care and
supervision could survive.
