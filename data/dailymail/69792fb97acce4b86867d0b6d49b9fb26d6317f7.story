Special bond: Mulan Jamila is looked after by her keeper Soleh after being given as a present to the Indonesian school

The pair have developed a close bond since Mulan Jamila's arrival and they are often seen playing in the lush green grass of the school. 

The tiger is kept as a pet at the school under a government permit.

Soleh has fed the tiger 5 kg (11 lbs) of meat per day since the animal was three months old.

In the wild, Bengal tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away - but rarely attack humans.

In their natural habitat Bengal tigers are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals.

The tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage and lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce.

A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60lbs in one night, though they usually eat less.

Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans however, a few do become dangerous maneaters.

These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where their traditional prey has vanished.

Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male.

Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.
