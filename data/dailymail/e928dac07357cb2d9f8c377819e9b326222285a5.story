The FBI has shut down online escort directory Myredbook.com and arrested two people on charges including facilitating prostitution and money laundering.

Federal agents seized the website and raided a house, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern California, believed to be connected to the online directory yesterday.

The alleged site operator Eric 'Red' Omuro and his assistant Annmarie Lanoce were arrested after a federal grand jury indicted them on Tuesday, U.S. attorney Melinda Haag said.

Omuro, who is due in court on Friday, has been released on $500,000 bond and Lanoce was released on $250,000 bond.

A U.S. attorney's spokeswoman did not know if they had attorneys.

The federal raid stems from a national crackdown on child sex trafficking this month, the Associated Press has reported.

Authorities say 168 children have been rescued and 281 alleged pimps arrested.

An unnamed law enforcement source told CNN officers were able to identify a number of the rescued children through myredbook.com.

The website has now been seized and features an FBI notice saying: 'This seizure is based on probable cause to believe that this domain name was involved in money laundering derived from racketeering based on prostitution in violation of state and federal law.'

According to the indictment, Omuro, of Mountain View, has been charged with numerous counts of money laundering while both he and Lanoce, of Rocklin, were charged with interstate travel in the aid of a racketeering enterprise.

Sex worker rights advocates in the Bay Area have expressed their concern that the free site had been seized.

Kristina Dolgin, spokesman of the Sex Worker Outreach Project in the Bay Area, told CBS San Francisco that those in the community could be put at risk.

She said: 'Theyâ€™re going to have less safe interactions and be put into situations where they can be put at risk of violence.'
