Costumes worn in the hit drama Downton Abbey have gone on display in the village where many of the scenes are filmed.

Ten costumes from the third series of Downton are on show at the West Ox Art Gallery in Bampton, Oxfordshire, which is frequently used as a location for Downton village.

Indeed, Bampton’s village church, St Mary’s, provided the location for the weddings of Lady Mary (played by Michelle Dockery) and Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael).

As part of the display visitors will be able to see a mixture of clothes from the ‘upstairs’ members of the Downton household and the ‘downstairs’, with weighty, embroidered gowns taking their place beside more simple staff uniforms.

A dress worn by Lady Rose McClare in the series demonstrates the muted palette popular at the time, with natural indigo dyes used to colour the cloth.

The village church has been the scene of much drama, having seen the wedding of Matthew and Lady Mary - and the jilting of Lady Edith

Classy in crimson: An evening dress worn by Lady Mary Crawley is a copy of a gown designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s on display in a new Downton Abbey exhibit at West Ox Art Gallery, Bampton, Oxforshire

A dress worn by Lady Rose McClare on show reveals the care and attention the costume department put into recreating the look of the period in which it was set: 1920 through to the autumn of 1921.

Costume designer Caroline McFall, who holds a Designers Guild award and an Emmy for her work on the show, says she doesn’t try to exactly copy outfits worn at the time, but instead translate them using the same aesthetic, making sure the style is appealing to a modern audience.

With season three opening at the beginning of the 1920s, costumes were shorter, less ornate and incorporated more art deco and flapper detailing.

Daywear is simple, using natural fabrics and dyes, and always worn with a hat, while evening gowns feature plenty of beading and are accessorised with headbands.

The hotly anticipated fourth season is about to start on ITV and promises to deliver the high drama the show has become known for. 

The exhibition, which runs until 29 September, also includes artworks inspired by the series. Admission costs £5.
