It’s hard to get excited about superhero games, let alone one starring a character many would not have heard of.

But interestingly, it’s Deadpool’s relative obscurity compared to the likes of Batman, Superman and Spiderman that will help him stand out from the crowd. 

For those who haven’t heard of Deadpool (real name, Wade Wilson), he’s a mentally unstable Marvel comic character known for his big mouth and affection for weapons. He also has the tendency to ‘break the fourth wall’, meaning that he is aware of the audience, and can interrupt the story at will for humorous effect.

Wild ride: It doesn't take long to realise that there's something different about this Marvel character

It’s this latter reason that made the 45-minute playthrough so enjoyable. Voiced by Uncharted star Nolan North, Deadpool’s unpredictability is as charming as it is intriguing. The fact that you never know what he’s going to do or say helps give the game a distinctive feel.

He’ll shout insults at you if you’re doing something he doesn’t like. Tap on the screen and mock you for following on-screen prompts. This is his game, and you play by his rules – not the other way around.

The danger of setting the standard so high with such a well-executed character, is that the gameplay faces a hard task to catch up. It’s no surprise, then, that combat is not as interesting.

There’s no denying that Deadpool has a wide range of authentic moves and weapons to wield, but it all feels very familiar.

Certain parts of the demo simply involved walking from room to room, wiping out as many not-too-bright baddies in the most stylish way possible.

Thankfully, there’s an upgrade system, so you’re encouraged to string-together the best combos and there are plenty of rooms to explore and load-up on collectables.

Always outnumbered, never out-gunned: The harder it is, the more Deadpool seems to enjoy himself

But for what Deadpool may lack in innovative gameplay, it makes up in spades by having such an interesting lead character. One that is well worth getting excited about.

Deadpool is released on June 28.
