James Lumley-Savile, pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court today, is the great-great grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough

An aristocrat is accused of threatening his girlfriend with a pair of kitchen knives because she made a joke about poisoning her father.

James Lumley-Savile, great-great-grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough, allegedly flew into a rage after his partner made the quip.

After grabbing the blades from the kitchen, the heir to the title Baron Savile is said to have waved them at her outside his £800,000 Fulham home.

He then brandished the weapons at a taxi driver who was called by his terrified girlfriend, prosecutors claim.

The cab driver drove away and called the police.

Officers who later searched the 39-year-old Google employee’s west London address also found a small bag of cannabis in the property.

Lumley-Savile, who appeared in the dock in a smart suit spoke only to confirm his identity during today’s brief hearing at Isleworth Crown Court.

He is charged with two counts of possessing an offensive weapon and a third charge of possessing a Class B drug.

Judge Phillip Matthews said: ‘Your next appearance will be on the 30 September at this court, in the meantime you remain on unconditional bail.’

His father, Eton-educated businessman and war hero Hon Henry Leoline Thornhill Lumley-Savile, was injured during the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 while a lieutenant with the Grenadier Guards.

Lumley-Savile is descended from the Earls of Halifax and Scarborough and is part of one of the oldest landowning families in Yorkshire.

He is set to inherit estates in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire.

Recently Lumley-Savile sought planning permission to convert their hunting retreat, Walshaw Lodge in Hebden Bridge into a five-star twenty-bedroom hotel.

Although the family’s ancestral seat in the town was sold in 2009 to pay inheritance tax, they still own almost 6,000 acres of land in the county.

Lumley-Savile of Fulham will next appear in court on 30 September to formally enter his pleas.
