Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings proved they had one more gold medal performance in them as they won the all-American final of women's beach volleyball in their last match as a team.

It was such an anticipated event that even Prince Harry and soccer star David Beckham couldnâ€™t stay away.

The dominating duo of May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings were looking to make it three in a row in London after winning gold in Beijing and Athens.

The women lost just one set in three Olympics.

Reliving her Dancing With the Stars days, May-Treanor began doing a funky jig to the sold-out crowed as the match ended.

No other beach volleyball team - men or women - has ever retained an Olympic title, let alone won a third.

May-Treanor said: 'We set the bar very high. We extended ourselves over that bar even higher.'

Walsh Jennings added: 'It's insane. 
It doesn't feel like it's real. I told Misty when we were getting our 
medals, "If I wake up tomorrow and we have to replay this match, I'm 
going to be furious."

'Because it feels like I'm in a 
dream. It truly feels surreal and it didn't feel like that the first two
times for whatever reason. But this, it's almost too good to be true.'

The pair has admitted that after nearly a 
decade together, their relationship became strained. So, before heading 
to London, they sought professional help.

The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported
earlier this month that May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings sought couples 
therapy to bolster their relationship before heading to London.

Walsh Jennings, 33, told the paper: 'We were in a funk, mentally. It wasn't physical at all. We were just in a weird place.'

What
followed were several sessions with famed sports psychologist Michael 
Gervais, who helped them learn how to work better as a team.

The winners hugged their family and friends in the stands - but not May-Treanor's husband, Matt, a Los Angeles Dodgers catcher - who was tuning in through a computer in the team's clubhouse.

On
the other side of the net were compatriots April Ross and Jen Kessy, 
who are taking home the silver in an unprecedented all-American final.

As
spectators packed into the volleyball court, Prince Harry could be seen
taking his seat at the Horse Guards Parade with British cyclists Jason 
Kenny and Laura Trott to catch the bikini-clad action.

Beckham and his son Cruz were also in attendance.

The match began in a dead heat, but it wasn't long before Walsh Jennings and May-Treanor pulled ahead in the first set.

They dominated in the second, leading the whole way.

May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings will officially pass the torch to Ross and Kessy, who made their Olympics debut in London.

Even Ross and Kessy have bowed to their opponents, calling their compatriots 'legends.'

While Walsh Jennings says she will 
continue playing beach volleyball internationally, May-Treanor, 35, 
plans to walk away from the sport for good.

Their successors are in awe of what they accomplished, with Ross calling their achievements 'just ridiculous.'

Kessy added: 'They're the best team of all time.'

Earlier, the Brazilian team of Larissa Franca and Juliana Silva won the bronze medal after defeating China.
