A Sudanese woman who was recently spared the death penalty for converting to Christianity said she fears the baby she gave birth to while in chains may not be able to walk properly.

Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, 27, gave birth to daughter Maya with her legs shackled and now doctors say she may need support to walk when she’s older.

Ibrahim, who was freed after an international outcry, said that ‘something has happened to the baby’.

She told CNN: ‘I was really scared of giving birth in prison. I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn’t open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn’t lying on the table.

‘Something has happened to the baby. I don’t know in the future whether she’ll need support to walk or not.’

Sudanese authorities and U.S. officials in Khartoum are currently negotiating to allow Ibrahim to leave Sudan.

She was detained at Khartoum airport last week, one day after an appeals court overturned a death sentence imposed on her for having converted from Islam to Christianity in order to marry her Christian American husband, Daniel Wani.

Her lawyer Mohaned Mostafa said Ibrahim, her husband and two children had all been staying at the U.S. embassy in Khartoum since her release, which was granted on the condition that Ibrahim remains in Sudan.

'There are talks going on currently between Sudanese and American officials to try to find a way for Mariam and her family to leave the country,' a source close to the case said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Ibrahim was detained on last Tuesday for trying to use documents issued by the embassy of South Sudan to fly out of Khartoum with her American-South Sudanese husband and their two children.

Despite lifting her death sentence after huge international pressure, Sudan still does not acknowledge Ibrahim's new identity as a Christian South Sudanese because it does not recognise her marriage. Muslim women are not permitted to marry Christian men under the Islamic laws that Sudan applies.

'The talks now are aiming to get her out of Sudan on a Sudanese passport,' the source said.

Ibrahim's husband Daniel Wani told Reuters that it was a 'misunderstanding' and error when Sudanese authorities said her travel documents were invalid, adding that his wife should have the right to adopt his South Sudanese nationality.

'There is diplomatic work going on and the Sudanese government offers help and cooperates in this matter,' Wani said in a phone conversation with Reuters. 'We will leave this time in a smooth manner and with travel documents that the Sudanese authorities accept.'

South Sudan, which has a majority Christian population, became independent from the mostly Muslim north after a referendum in 2011 that ended years of civil war.

Ibrahim's case has been closely monitored by Washington and London, which last month summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires to protest against Ibrahim's initial death sentence and urged Sudan to uphold its international obligations on freedom of religion and belief.

A U.S. spokeswoman said on Thursday before Ibrahim's release that Ibrahim had all the documents she needed to travel to the United States.

The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Sudan since 1997 over alleged human rights violations. It intensified sanctions in 2006 over Khartoum's actions in its conflict with rebels in the western region of Darfur.

Ms Ibrahim, born in eastern Sudan's Gedaref state on November 3, 1987, is the daughter of a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother, according to a statement from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum obtained by AFP.

Her father abandoned the family when she was five, and she was raised according to her mother's faith, it says.

'She has never been a Muslim in her life,' said the statement signed by Father Mussa Timothy Kacho, episcopal vicar for Khartoum. Miss Ibrahim joined the Catholic church shortly before she married Mr Wani in December 2011, the vicar said.

Mr Wani was born in Khartoum but is now a U.S. citizen, the U.S. embassy confirmed to AFP last Tuesday.

The case against Ms Ibrahim dates from 2013 when 'a group of men who claim to be Mariam's relatives' filed an initial legal action, the vicar's statement said.

In fact, she had never seen those men before, the statement added, in comments confirmed by her lawyer, Mohanad Mustafa.

Ms Ibrahim, who is a trained doctor, and her husband own a barber shop, a mini-mart and an agricultural project in Gedaref, the vicar said.

Mr Mustafa did not know if there is a link between the businesses and the case against Ms Ibrahim, but he told AFP: 'Surely there is something behind this'.

Sudan introduced Islamic Shariah law in the early 1980s under the rule of autocrat Jaafar Nimeiri, contributing to the resumption of an insurgency in the mostly animist and Christian south of Sudan. The south seceded in 2011 to become the world's newest nation, South Sudan.

Sudanese President Omar Bashir, an Islamist who seized power in a 1989 military coup, has said his country will implement Islam more strictly now that the non-Muslim south is gone.

A number of Sudanese have been convicted of apostasy in recent years, but they all escaped execution by recanting their new faith.
