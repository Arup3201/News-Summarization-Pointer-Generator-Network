Pressure: Marc Bolland is expected to reveal general sales fell by 1.5 per cent despite 30 per cent discounts

Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland will come under mounting pressure this week following another dismal Christmas for the high street giant.

The company is expected to reveal that sales of general merchandise including clothes fell 1.5per cent in the crucial festive period despite discounts of up to 30 per cent.

That is far worse than the 0.5 per cent slide analysts had predicted and will trigger renewed speculation over Mr Bolland’s future as chief executive.

The results, due to be published on Thursday, will confirm that M&S was one of the big losers on the high street for a third Christmas in a row.

Clive Black, a retail analyst at stock broker Shore Capital, said: ‘There was a cautious expectation they were about to turn the corner but it doesn’t look like they have turned much if at all.’

Debenhams issued a severe profits warning on New Year’s Eve as it became the first high profile casualty of the festive season.

Tesco and Sainsbury are also expected to release disappointing figures this week.

But other retailers have fared far better including John Lewis, Next and House of Fraser.

The success of rival stores - and particularly Next where sales jumped 11.9 per cent between November 1 and December 24 - will only serve to highlight just how badly M&S is doing.

Annual profits at Next this year are set to beat those at M&S for the first time.

The expected 1.5 per cent fall in clothing sales at M&S in the 13 weeks to December 28 is even worse than the 1.3 per cent decline suffered in the previous three months.

Food sales are thought to have risen 2 per cent but overall total sales look set to be flat at best.

The much-lauded autumn/winter clothing ranges, marketed by a major poster campaign featuring Helen Mirren, have failed to revive the company’s fortunes.

Experts thought the high street chain was on the brink of changed fortunes but the new figures disprove that

M&S was forced into heavy discounting in an attempt to win back shoppers including its much-heralded ‘Mega Day’ on the Saturday before Christmas when the price of clothing lines was slashed by up to 30 per cent.

Sales of general merchandise have already declined for nine quarters in a row.

But Mr Bolland, who has been chief executive since 2010, has denied that the success of the latest autumn/winter ranges, the first from a new clothing team, will make or break his stewardship of the company.

He has insisted that the company is on the right track now that decades of under-investment are being addressed and it is thought that investors are willing to give Mr Bolland more time for his turn-around to bear fruit.

City commentator David Buik, of stock broker Panmure Gordon, said Mr Bolland’s position as chief executive ‘must be vulnerable’.

He said: ‘The problems are with the fashion, which remains dowdy and without flair. The shops are still poorly laid out. Fund managers will run out of patience but will give him another three months.’ He said: ‘The problems are with the fashion, which remains dowdy and without flair.
