As anyone who has spent time in New york knows, residents are rarely shy of voicing their concerns and complaints about their city.

A new map shows them in real time - revealing the mood of every neighborhood.

Created by Microsoft, it uses data from the city's 311 service.

The map is created from New York City’s 311 non-emergency data stream, which takes as its input New York residents’ emails, phone calls, and text messages sent to communicate issues to city authorities.

Each day, HereHere pulls 311 data for each neighborhood and identifies the most compelling, important 311 request types, and the system generates cartoons and text that represent a neighborhood’s characterized reactions.

Called HereHere, Microsoft said New York city was the obvious choice to launch the project.

'If any city can be called opinionated, it would be New York City, so it’s somehow inevitable that HereHere is making its debut in the Big Apple,' the firm said.

Developed by Microsoft Research’s Future Social Experiences Labs (FUSE Labs), the project has taken a year to create.

'HereHere NYC introduces daily neighborhood engagement with a light touch,' Kati London, the project's lead, said.

The map takes neighborhood-specific public data for 40 areas, and it enables the neighborhoods to communicate how they’re doing—expressed through text and cartoonlike icons.

'People can receive the information via a daily email digest, neighborhood-specific Twitter feeds, or status updates on an online map.

'We want to understand how it changes or impacts the way people relate to their community when they can interact with data in this way.'

'Think of it as a meta-status update for the day—a simplification of issues in your neighborhood compressed into a text that you might get from a friend,' London said.

'We’re giving a human voice to the neighborhood which, hopefully, will stimulate conversations about issues.

'We’re eager to get people using it and seeing how it impacts them,” London says.

'Will they continue to use it? Will it provoke conversations within the community or discussions across communities? The interface is mobile-friendly and it’s particularly easy for users to post or tweet what a neighborhood is saying today.

'Each neighborhood also has a Twitter account you can follow and tweet out.'
