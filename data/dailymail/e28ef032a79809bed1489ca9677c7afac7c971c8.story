A pizza containing 35 ingredients from 60 different countries has been discovered by food safety testers investigating the horsemeat scandal.

The 35 exotic ingredients - drawn from five different continents - were used as an example by the National Audit Office to illustrate how difficult it was to verify the origins of the processed food eaten in the UK.

In a report on food safety and authenticity in the processed meat supply chain, the watchdog warned that ‘food fraud’ was rife.

In a report prompted by the scandal over horsemeat in British foods, the NAO said it had become even harder to determine what was actually in food because of the long, international supply chains.

The NAO report said: ‘Recent analysis of the components of a pizza, carried out for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, found that it was made from 35 different ingredients that passed through 60 countries, on five different continents.’

Irish authorities testing the processed meal did not name the brand.

The pizza box had the label: ‘country of origin: Ireland’.

The NAO also found that testing for the authenticity of food had become harder because of a split in responsibility between the Food Standards Agency, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

Local authorities reported 1,380 cases of food fraud in 2012 - up by two thirds since 2010.

THE BASE:

Dough: France, UK, Poland, USA.

Yeast: UK, Ireland, Germany

Salt: UK, France, China

Sugar: Brazil, Indonesia, Jamaica, UK

Herbs: Greece, Italy, Spain, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Morocco

Tomato Paste: Italy, France, Netherlands

AND SOME OF THE TOPPINGS:

Cheese: Swizerland, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, UK, Netherlands

Chicken: Brazil, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Germany

Anchovies: Peru, Argentina, Italy, Falkland Islands, Spain, Iceland, Denmark.

Pepperoni: Poland, Italy, Ireland, UK, Denmark, USA

Vegetables 'from a host of Mediterranean countries'

Olive oil: Italy, Greece, Spain.

Chilli Peppers: 'Africa, Asia, South America'

Just one third of local authorities recorded the laboratory results on the Food Standard Agency’s national database.

And the total number of food samples tested by official control laboratories in England has gone down by a quarter since 2009-10, the report said.

Many tests were now carried out by private food businesses but public authorities did not know the results.

The NAO recommended that some money be diverted away from checking slaughter houses to investigating the factories where processed meat was produced and the long supply chains involved.

However this change would require agreement at European Union level.

NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The January 2013 horsemeat incident has revealed a gap between what citizens expect of the controls over the authenticity of their food, and the effectiveness of those controls in reality.

‘The division of responsibilities for food safety and authenticity has created confusion.

‘The Government needs to remove this confusion, and improve its understanding of potential food fraud and how intelligence is brought together and shared.’

Richard Bacon, a Tory member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee said: ‘The public have every right to expect that government should be able to provide a system to ensure food safety, to investigate problems where they occur and to solve problems. In this case, taxpayers and consumers were let down.

‘Food fraud is a serious and growing problem. The government must grip this quickly and simplify the system, removing any confusion over who is responsible for what.’

Maria Eagle, Labour’s Shadow Environment 
Secretary, said: ‘The chaotic structure put in place after the election 
should urgently be reviewed, with serious consideration given to 
bringing responsibility for food safety and authenticity back together.’

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our research shows a third of people say they are buying less meat following the horsemeat scandal so there’s still a way to go to restore consumer confidence in the food industry.

‘The scandal exposed a web of confusion, which is why we have been calling for the Government to move responsibilities for labelling and standards back to the FSA.’

There was outrage in January this year when it emerged horse meat was present in products from a number of UK supermarkets including ASDA, Tesco and Iceland.

It later emerged that horses from countries like Romania were being slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty and then shipped into the UK as beef products.

Horsemeat was found in a number of popular products including Tesco burgers, Tesco’s everyday value spaghetti bolognaise and a Findus lasagne.
