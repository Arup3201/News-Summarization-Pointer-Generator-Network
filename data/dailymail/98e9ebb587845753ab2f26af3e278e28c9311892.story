Helping others: Lord Freud, the health and safety minister, pictured, said people should not fear doing a ‘good deed’ for friends, family or neighbours

People should ignore ‘bogus’ health and safety warnings and help clear ice and snow from outside their neighbours’ homes, a minister said last night.

Lord Freud, the health and safety minister, said people should not fear doing a ‘good deed’ for friends, family or neighbours.

The Government is introducing a ‘Good Samaritan law’ to give people who intervene in good faith to help someone else in difficulty from prosecution or legal action.

Similar legislation operates in Australia where it has reduced the potential for negligence claims against doctors and emergency workers, as well as ordinary members of the public.

Lord Freud said people would not be sued or held responsible if someone fell and injured themselves on a path or pavement that they had cleared.

‘People need to be aware that they will not be reprimanded for doing a good deed by clearing ice and snow,’ he said.

‘The truth is very simple: you can clear ice and snow from footpaths and pavements but always be careful that you don’t put yourself in danger.

‘Countless lives have been saved and injuries prevented because of robust health and safety practices. But bogus excuses give real safety laws a bad name and stop people from taking action.’

Chair of the Health and Safety Executive Judith Hackitt said: ‘Anyone can clear ice and snow from public spaces, so don’t be put off because you’re afraid someone will get injured.

'Remember, people walking on snow and ice have a responsibility to themselves to be careful.’

An official Government ‘snow code’ advises householders to clear paths and driveways earlier in the day when snow is fresh and loose. They are urged not to use water to clear snow as it refreezes into black ice.
