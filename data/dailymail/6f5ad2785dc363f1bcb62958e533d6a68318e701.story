Pictures of this baby elephant learning to walk are testament to the old adage - the bigger they are, the harder they fall.

The 200lb week-old newborn was captured collapsing under its own weight as it struggled to walk beside its mother at the Samburu National Park in Kenya.

Photographed by Margot Raggett, the images show the elephant mother patiently wandering beside its baby as it repeatedly wobbles and collapses while learning to walk.

The elephant calf, wandering close to its mother for support decides to raise a leg to its trunk

But in doing so, the overconfident youngster wobbles and attempts to correct his balance

Unable to correct itself, the calf then collapses into a heap on the ground

It then gives up completely, flopping onto its side in the dry riverbank while its mother looks on

She said: 'Young elephants are one of my favourite species to photograph, they are so adorable.

'If they are not playing and being mischievous they are acting like clowns while trying to find their feet.

'This youngster completely lost its footing in the dry riverbed and then when it finally struggled to its feet proceeded to examine one of its feet like it was to blame for it falling over.'

She added: 'In the meantime the mother just carried on patiently grazing, though you could see she was keeping a watch on the youngster out of the corner of her eye'.

Adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves, helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators.

If a calf loses its mother for some reason other female in the group will take care of it.

Elephants are under threat throughout Africa due to poaching, including in Kenya where these photos were taken.

Eventually it picked itself up and continued walking with the support of its mother

But only a few minutes later, it took another tumble - this time trunk first - into the dry grass
