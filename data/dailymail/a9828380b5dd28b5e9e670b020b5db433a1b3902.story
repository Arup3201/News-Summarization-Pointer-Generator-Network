The crack-smoking Mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, will travel across the boarder into the U.S. to present a show aimed at 'junkies'.

But the embattled politician will not be doling out advice to those who indulge in the types of substances he has come to be linked with.

Instead, he will be heard on a weekly Washington DC sports radio show called 'The Sports Junkies'.

Disgraced: With much of his political power having been stripped in Toronto, Rob Ford, left, will present a weekly radio show in Washington DC

Popular: Ford, right, posing with a fan during the first half of an NFL football game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Buffalo Bills, will be part of the show called 'Sports Junkies'

The programme, broadcast on '106.7 FM The Fan' is expected to feature phone in sections where he will talk with callers about some of the country's major leagues, including the NFL.

Mayor Ford's segment will be on Thursdays at 8:40 a.m. and starts this week.

Ford has had his political wings clipped by Toronto City Council after he admitted smoking the banned substance in a drunken stupor'.

Standing firm: The Mayor has refused to walk away from his post despite admitting he smoked crack while drunk

Although still holding office many of his powers have been stripped.

While the Mayor has refused to stand down over the affair, more allegations have since been levelled at him over his drug use.

It has been reported that he may have offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers to buy back video footage of him smoking crack.

In police wiretaps of alleged gang members one is heard telling another that he rejected the offer for the tape and planned to meet the mayor and ask for '150,' meaning $150,000.

Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs.

On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and that he would post a picture on Instagram.

On another wiretap, one man says he has many pictures of Ford 'doing the hezza,'Â which police say is known to be slang for heroin.

Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer, said the wiretaps are snippets of alleged gangsters who are talking among themselves.

'It's very dangerous to put any weight into any of this,' Mr Morris told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to address.'
