A German rapper who embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with ISIS is overseeing the militant group's push to recruit Britons to come to the region and fight.

Denis Cuspert, 39, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, is reported to have personally sworn an oath of loyalty to ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in April and has become the group's main propagandist.

Like Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister for Propaganda, he appeals to young, disillusioned people in Europe and provides an alternative ideology.

Cuspert is a Muslim convert who holds previous prison convictions and was born to a German mother and a Ghanaian father in Berlin.

Cuspert spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam and travelling to join ISIS in Syria.

He now oversees the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region.

It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'.

The rapper appeared in an ISIS beheading video and was seen holding the severed head of a man who he claims fought the terror group and as a result 'received the death penalty'.

Another man in the video explains in Arabic that the victims were members of Syria's al-Sheitaat tribe, a group of about 70,000 Sunnis who are fighting ISIS.

Around 700 members of the tribe were massacred by ISIS in August.

The Sun reports he is the subject of a dossier compiled by German security services, which quotes him as saying: 'My duty is to use my voice for telling people the truth and the truth is jihad is a duty.

The lyrics in his song 'Who's Afraid of the Black Man" show his hatred for the West and his tendency towards violence.

The song states: 'Doing time in my skin like Tookie Williams in San Quentin. No identity, where will this end?

'In a white world full of hate and illusion. The last option was only violence and emotion.'

Terrorism expert Raphael Perl of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) told Dutch newspaper Trouw: 'He gained fame with music and now he brings his fans in contact with a radical ideology.'
