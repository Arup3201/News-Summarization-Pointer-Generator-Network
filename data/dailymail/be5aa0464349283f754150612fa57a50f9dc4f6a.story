'Rogue trader': Former UBS banker Kweku Adoboli allegedly lost his bank £1.4 billion in Britain's biggest banking fraud

A city trader who thought he had ‘the magic touch’ gambled away £1.4billion in Britain’s biggest banking fraud, a court heard.

Kweku Adoboli, 32, is accused of acting as a ‘master fraudster’ to conceal the colossal losses he was making at the Swiss bank UBS.

Southwark Crown Court heard how the former public school head boy was driven by ‘greed and ego’ on his reckless spree.

His disastrous trades left a trail of ‘chaos and disaster’ landing the bank with losses of £1.4billion and wiping around £2.8billion off its share price.

At one stage he faced losing UBS almost £7.4billion in unhedged investments.

Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting, said: ‘This is not a one off, heat-of-the-moment rogue trader carried away on a wave of euphoria. Mr Adoboli was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland’s largest bank.’

She described him as ‘a greedy banker, out of control and out for himself’.

Jurors were told his losses would have been enough to pay a year’s salary for almost 70,000 nurses, build two Wembley stadiums or six hospitals.

She said: ‘Mr Adoboli’s motive was to increase his bonus, his status within the bank, his job prospects and of course his ego. Like most gamblers, he believed he had the magic touch.

‘And like most gamblers, when he lost, he caused chaos and disaster to himself and all of those around him.’

Adoboli was described as a ‘trusted and admired’ member of his team who was rewarded with large bonuses for what his bosses thought were huge profits.

But Miss Wass said: ‘Mr Adoboli’s greed got the better of him and he took advantage of the bank’s trust to cheat the system for his own gain.’

By the time his ‘pyramid of fraud’ collapsed, Adoboli was ‘throwing money wildly into the market hoping to dig himself out of the mess he had created’.

She said: ‘In effect, Mr Adoboli had ceased to act as a professional investment banker and had begun to approach his work as a naked gambler. He had become what is sometimes referred to as a rogue trader. Mr Adoboli’s activities were more deliberate than that of a mere rogue trader.

'Motive': A court heard UBS investment banker Kweku Adoboli hoped to boost his bonus and position within the company as well as ego

Allegations: Kweku Adoboli is accused of making unauthorised trades when he worked for Swiss bank UBS in their London office

‘He did not simply make a few wild 
bets. He faked bookings, created false accounts and conducted himself as
a master fraudster, deliberately and systematically deceiving and 
defrauding the bank.’

Miss Wass said Adoboli had 
‘fraudulently side-stepped’ rules that banned high-risk investments, 
adding: ‘He was lying to... his senior managers, his risk-control 
department, and the accounts department.

‘In effect he was risking the very existence of the bank by gambling its resources, ultimately for his own benefit.’

Adoboli worked in the global synthetic
equities division of UBS, where his career ‘progressed at great speed’.
His salary soared from £50,000 with a £15,000 bonus in 2008 to £110,000
with a £250,000 bonus in 2010.

Miss Wass said his income rose not 
because he was a top trader but because, as he later admitted, it was 
during this period that he began to fraudulently gamble the bank’s 
money... to maximise his bonus and enhance his reputation as a top 
trader’.

But on September 14 last year, his 
trades were challenged by UBS accountant William Steward. After speaking
to Mr Steward, Adoboli left his office that afternoon pretending to go 
to a doctor’s appointment. Instead, Miss Wass said he sent Mr Steward a 
‘bombshell email’ in which he owned up. He was arrested the next day. In
the email, which was read to the court, he said: ‘Dear Will, It is with
great stress that I write this mail,’ before going on to describe how 
Adoboli had hidden losses through other trades that initially made a 
profit before losing more and more.

Risking it all: Southwark Crown Court heard Adoboli stopped behaving like an investment banker and fell into a gambling mindset

He signed off: ‘I take full 
responsibility for my actions and the s*** storm that will now ensue. I 
am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my 
bank and my colleagues at risk. Thanks, Kweku.’

Miss Wass said: ‘In the email, Mr 
Adoboli clearly admits that, one – he fabricated deals; two – that he 
invented non-existent clients; three – that he broke the rules; four – 
that he lied to the supervisor; and five – he hoodwinked colleagues.

‘On September 14, his system crashed 
like a car hitting a wall at high speed. He was left with no choice but 
to admit exactly what he had been up to.’

The court was told Adoboli will claim 
he was not acting dishonestly and that colleagues knew what he had been 
doing. He denies two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting.
The trial continues.

The court heard Kweku Adoboli eventually had to own up to what he had been doing and sent this email to chartered accountant William Steward:'Dear Will,It is with great stress that I write this mail. First of all the ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) trades that you see on the ledger are not trades that I have done with a counterparty as I previously described.I used the bookings as a way to suppress the PnL losses that I have accrued through off-book trades that I made. Those trades were previously profit making, became loss making as the market sold off aggressively through the aggressive sell-off days of July and early August.Initially, I had been short futures through June and those lost money when the first Greek confidence vote went through in mid-June. In order to try and make the money back I flipped the trade long through the rally.Although I had a couple of opportunities to unwind the long trade for a negligible loss, I did not move quickly enough for the market weakness on the back of the first back macro data and then an escalation Eurozone crisis cost me the losses you will see when the ETF bookings are cancelled. The aim had been to try and make the money back before the September expiry date came through but I clearly failed.These are still live trades on the book that will need to be unwound. Namely a short position in DAX futures [which had been rolled to December expiry] and a short position in S and P 500 futures that are due to expire on Friday.I have now left the office for the sake of discretion. I will need to come back in to discuss the positions and explain face to face, but for reasons that are obvious, I did not think it wise to stay on the desk this afternoon.I will expect that questions will be asked as to why nobody else was aware of these trades.The reality is that I have always maintained that these were EFP trades to the member of my team, BUC, trade support and John Di Bacco (Adoboli's manager).I take full responsibility for my actions and the s*** storm that will now ensue. I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at risk.Thanks, Kweku.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
