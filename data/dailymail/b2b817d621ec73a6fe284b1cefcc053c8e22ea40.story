Lloyds Banking Group is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it was bailed out in 2008 - and will hand over £130million to the taxpayer.

The lender, which is 24 per cent Government-owned, said today its profits for 2014 was £1.8billion.

After its recovery three million shareholders will today be given 75p for every share they own, resulting in payments totalling £535million. 

Landmark moment: Lloyds Banking Group is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it was bailed out in 2008 - and will hand over £130million to the taxpayer

Lloyds was rescued after a £20billion taxpayer injection in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.

It led to it being 40 per cent owned by the Government and that stake has since been reduced to 24 per cent.

It means the Treasury will pick up £130 million in dividends, but it is still a small amount compared to how much it ploughed into the bank to save it from collapse.

Chancellor George Osborne said the pay-out, which required regulatory approval, was good news for millions of savers who hold Lloyds shares or have money invested in Lloyds through their pensions.

He added: 'Today's results are another major milestone in the recovery of the British economy from the great recession and the bank bailouts.'

The bank disclosed an annual bonus pool of £369.5 million, a decline of 3.6 per cent on the previous year.

It also said its chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio received £11.5 million for 2014.

He said: 'This is a symbolic development that bears testament to our successful transformation and improved risk profile of the business.'

This includes more than £7 million from a long-term share-based plan which was linked to the bank's performance for the three years since 2012.
