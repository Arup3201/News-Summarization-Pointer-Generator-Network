Police are investigating a vicious assault on a 13-year-old girl, who was bashed by a female classmate in front of a cheering crowd in Sydney’s south-west.

The brutal attack was filmed by a Year 12 student, revealing the horrific ordeal which saw Jaimee-Lee Morecroft kicked, punched and dragged her by her hair by a fellow Year 8 student.

Eagle Vale High School student Jaimee-Lee can be heard pleading with the attacker as she protects her head, insisting: ‘I never said anything about your brother.’

In the lead up to the attack, Nine News reports Jaimee-Lee was receiving threatening messages on social media.

‘She could have been killed,’ Jaimee-Lee’s grandmother Shirley Williams told Nine News.

NSW Police confirm they are looking into the incident.

‘Macquarie Fields command have seen the video depicting an alleged assault at Claymore,’ NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia.

At a sports oval in Claymore in Sydney’s south-west, Jaimee-Lee was filmed surrounded by people but it appears no-one stepped in to defend her.

Bystanders can be heard yelling ‘woah, that impact!’ and ‘just have a break, just let her catch her breath.’

Jaimee-Lee’s mother Vickie Williams cannot bring herself to watch the footage, as her daughter’s assault is too distressing.

‘It makes me sick, she’s my child, I shouldn’t have to watch stuff like that,’ Ms Williams told Nine News.

The student responsible has been suspended for 21 days and returns to school tomorrow.

However there are concerns that the student has not learnt her lesson.

Jaimee-Lee alleges she is still receiving threats from the attacker, which has left the 13-year-old terrified to face her classmate tomorrow.

‘She said, “just wait til school comes back, you’re going to get it”’ Jaimee-Lee told Nine News.

The Department of Education says the girls’ high school is committed to creating a positive, safe school environment and supporting their students.

‘Eagle Vale High School has strong student welfare and anti-bullying policies and programs.’

The police investigation is ongoing.  

The students both attend Eagle Vale High School. The student who attacked Jaimee-Lee has just completed a 21-day suspension for the incident and is expected to return to school on Tuesday
