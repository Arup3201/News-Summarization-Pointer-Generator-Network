MARK ALFORD COMMENT: Bradley Wiggins was a shoo-in for Sports Personality of the Year... but now I'm not so sure. Flicking a finger at waiting photographers today betrays his recently-acquired sporting hero status. Bluntly, it was an uncouth and unnecessary act.

As Bradley Wiggins was released from hospital following an accident in Lancashire on Wednesday, the head coach of Great Britain was rushed to A&E in Manchester suffering bleeding on the brain after being knocked off his bike.

Shane Sutton, 55, one of Wiggins' coaches for his time trial success at the London Olympics, was hospitalised with bleeding and bruising on the brain following the road accident in Levenshulme, Manchester, on Thursday.

The incident came less than 24 hours after Wiggins, who was out training, was knocked off his bike by a Vauxhall Astra as it 
pulled out of a filling station.

'Ok': Wiggins left with at least two broken ribs after being knocked off his bike by a car

Hospitalised: Shane Sutton, Team GB's head cycling coach, was rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon

He lay on the floor for a 
quarter of an hour before the ambulance arrived, according to witnesses, and sustained at least two broken ribs and a suspected dislocated finger.

A spokesperson for British Cycling 
said: 'British Cycling has confirmed that Shane Sutton, head coach for 
the GB Cycling Team, was involved in an incident this morning on the A6 
near Levenshulme in Manchester.

'Shane was taken into hospital where it was identified he has suffered bruising and bleeding on the brain.

'Shane was wearing a helmet. He is set to undergo more tests, and is likely to stay in hospital for the next few days.'

The spokesperson added: 'It is extremely rare that our riders and coaches are hurt while out cycling on the road, even rarer that two incidents should occur in a short space of time, and we wish Shane and Bradley a speedy recovery.

'Cycling is not an intrinsically dangerous activity but there is much more to be done to improve conditions for cyclists on the roads.

'British Cycling is calling on the government to put cycling at the heart of transport policy to ensure that cycle safety is built into the design of all new roads, junctions and transport projects, rather than being an afterthought.'

Police sources said the collision involving Sutton, on his bike, and a Peugeot 206 car took place at about 8.55am near the junction of Stockport Road and Clare Road in Levenshulme.

The driver of the Peugeot was not injured and no arrests were made.

British Cycling director Martin Gibbs
believes the Government should be doing more to prevent such incidents, and said: 'These 
incidents do remind you that we've got a long way to go we need to look 
to our cousins abroad and Copenhagen and see what they've done.

'30 per cent of people making journey there do so on their bike.

'We need the Department of Transport to stop thinking of cycling as an add-on. 

'Nine
out of 10 British cycling members have a car it has to be about more 
mutual respect looking out for each other. We mustn't make this a sort 
of tribal battle.'

Australian Sutton has worked 
with the GB Cycling team since 2002 and has been credited with playing a
major role in transforming the fortunes of the sport in this country.

Unfortunate: Both Sutton (left) and Wiggins (right) were involved in unrelated accidents within 24 hours of each other

Mentor: Sutton was one of Wiggins' coaches when he sealed a time trial gold at London 2012

He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2010 for his services to sport.
Sutton's career began as a road and track cyclist where he won numerous 
titles including a Commonwealth Games gold medal in the 1978 team 
pursuit competition and the 1990 Milk Race.

He split his time between the track and the road in coaching this year's British competitors at the London Olympics.

Throughout his career at GB Cycling, 
he was said by Team Sky to have 'repeatedly got the best out of his 
charges through his sheer enthusiasm and force of personality'.

Police also confirmed that Wiggins, 32, has broken at least two ribs but has otherwise escaped with severe bruising.

His support team who were following him raced to his aid at Wrightington, Lancashire, close to his home near Chorley.

The mum of the cycling champion has spoken to the star since the crash.

Linda Wiggins, a school secretary, said: 'I have spoken to him briefly and he's okay.'

Garage attendant Yasmin Smith, who also helped Wiggins, said: ‘By the time I got there he had moved to a safer place but was still on the ground and he was in a lot of pain.

'His hands looked bruised and they were curled up a bit. And then his colour changed.'He got put in a local person's car and when the ambulance came they attended to him immediately. His wife [tried to] hug him and he said: 'Don't, my ribs'.'He was assisted [in] walking to the ambulance. He could stand up. I think his ribs and hands were the main concern.

‘He said he thought he had broken his ribs and while a lot of police cars arrived it was about 15 minutes before the ambulance got there and by then he was blue.’

Another witness, truck driver Barry Blacklidge, arrived shortly after the incident.

He told The Sun: 'I could see a pushbike, like a mountain bike, and the front wheel was all buckled. I went into the garage and asked what was going on. She said "Bradley Wiggins has just been knocked off his bike".

'The ambulance turned up and they treated him for a while. He was up and walking around, but apparently he wasn’t too good.'

Wiggins, a father of two, broke his collarbone in the 2011 Tour de France before recovering to win this year’s event and take gold medal in the Olympic time trial.

The national hero only recently shaved off his ‘lucky’ sideburns.

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to the scene of a road traffic accident at Crow Orchard Road in Wrightington at about 6pm this evening.

'A cyclist has been involved in a collision with a white Vauxhall Astra car. The rider of the bike, a 32-year-old local man, was taken to hospital by ambulance with injuries not thought to be life-threatening. His family have been told.'

In a statement on its website, Team Sky said: 'We can confirm that on Wednesday evening Bradley Wiggins was involved in a road traffic accident whilst riding his bike near his home in Lancashire.

'He is being kept in hospital overnight for observation but the injuries he has sustained are not thought to be serious and he is expected to make a full and speedy recovery.

'We will announce more details in due course.'

Hero: Wiggins was the first Briton to win the Tour

From fellow Olympic medallists to fans of Bradley Wiggins, people have taken to Twitter to offer their messages of support to the Tour de France champion and Team GB's head coach Shane Sutton.

Wiggins' former Team Sky team-mate Mark Cavendish (@MarkCavendish) wrote: 'Really wishing my friend Bradley Wiggins a speedy recovery in hospital after being knocked off his bike by a car yesterday.'

In particular, Wiggins' Team GB team-mates, Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott wished the pair well.
