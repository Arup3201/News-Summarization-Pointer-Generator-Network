Former journalist Amanda Goff has become a global sensation in the past few weeks after she revealed her double life as a high-class escort and a 'tuck shop' mum. 

But now the 40-year-old has hit back by appearing on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X. 

Goff says she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been.

She said: 'I knew the book (Hooked — Secrets of a High-Class Escort) was going to be controversial - I wasn't writing about knitting,' she says from Los Angeles, where she is appearing on a show about sex and relationships.

Former journalist Amanda Goff appeared on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X

The mother-of-two was surprised her book, Hooked — Secrets of a High-Class Escort went global

'What's surprised me is that it's gone global...

'It's not the first book that's been written about it, nor will it be the last.

'Maybe it's because I have children? Because I'm 40? Because I'm owning it? I'm busier at 40 than when I lied and said I was 34,' reports the Sydney Morning Herald. 

Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines says she is 'living the life I am supposed to be living'. 

She adds her profession has given her 'insight' that she previously lacked because she understands men more. 

She explained: 'They're very simple creatures. I get where they're coming from now. They're not coming from malice, they just can't help themselves.

'They want to be loved and they feel loved through sex.'

The mother of two has defended the backlash her news will have on her kids and says she is a 'good mother'. 

Two days after the interview last month, Ms Goff's ex-husband, Sydney banker David Basha (right) told Daily Mail Australia that he was disgusted with his former wife's decision to publicly announce her identity

Ms Goff says her new profession has made her 'value love and sex a lot more' and she wouldn't pick up a guy in a bar, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

She claims that she is helping marriages by providing relief to men but that she also wants a partner. 

She said: 'Of course, I do get sick of making people happy and going home alone. I don't want to glamourise it. There are elements of loneliness - for the men who visit and for the women.

'We all want to understand how the opposite sex works and we all want a partner.

Goff continues to work as an escort - and to work in her kid's school tuckshop.

'I'm not ashamed of who I am. We are all adults and have the right to choose our path.

'Not to be ashamed of who you are - that's what I want to teach my kids.

'I'm not going to apologise because I offend people. Like it or love it, people are buying the book.'

Ms Goff hit back after the initial criticism she suffered after the interview on Sunday Night. 

In an article in the Herald Sun she claimed her life was 'boring and normal' after the media storm.

The 40-year-old dismissed criticism that her children were negatively affected by her career choice, writing in the Herald Sun: 'Professions do not define our parenting skills'

'So far, the only thing we had to deal with at school this week was my son getting hit on the head with a soccer ball, which caused a few tears.

'So, while I appreciate your concern, my kids are fine, thank you very much. How are yours?' 

Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones.

She revealed she chose to go public in the tell all interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night - after publishing her book under the name 'Samantha X' - because she wanted to have control. 

Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X

He said: 'It's a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what's going on. I'm worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.'

She said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex.

'I haven't had sex for ages actually... I'm like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday.

'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I've wiped away a lot of tears. They're paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them.

'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea.

'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we're not hurting anyone.' 

'I'm busier at 40 than when I lied and said I was 34,' Ms Goff said
