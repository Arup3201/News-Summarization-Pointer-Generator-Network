Team USA may have been celebrating dominance in the pool and on the tennis court on Saturday, but in track and field events the mood was far less joyful.

American athletes picked up just three medals, and not a single gold, on the second day of running, jumping and throwing events.

And to add injury to insult, one of the team's greatest medal hopes pulled out of the 400m due to a hamstring strain.

Third place: Team USA's other medal came from Will Claye, who picked up bronze in the long jump

While three medals from six events would be a decent haul for most other nations, it is a blow for the U.S., which has traditionally dominated track and field.

To make matters worse, the poor results came on a day dominated by Great Britain, usually seen as the junior partner in the so-called 'Special Relationship'.

The team's first medal of the day came in the men's long jump, when Will Claye took the bronze with a score of 8.12m.

Claye, an Arizona 21-year-old competing in his first Games, was nearly 20cm behind the gold medallist, Britain's Greg Rutherford, who put his home advantage to good use as he jumped 8.31m.

The next American medallist was long-distance runner Galen Rupp, who took silver in the men's 10,000m after completing the course in 27:30.90.

If the 26-year-old from Oregon had matched his own personal best of 26:48.00, it would have been enough to beat his training partner, Mo Farah of the UK, who came in just half a second faster than Rupp.

Veteran sprinter Carmelita Jeter was tipped by some for a gold medal in the women's 100m, but could not do enough to dethrone reigning champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, of Jamaica.

Californian Jeter, 32, ran 10.78 seconds, only a fraction behind her rival's 10.75.

The experienced runner had never appeared in the Olympics before, despite being a three-time World Championships gold medallist.

Although she holds the title of second-fastest female 100m runner in history, with a personal best of 10.64, she was unable to break the Jamaican dominance of the ultimate sprint event.

There are still plenty of track and field medals up for grabs, and Team USA will be hoping to improve on its patchy record in the days to come.

However, one star who will not be able to compete for glory is LaShawn Merritt, who won the 400m gold medal in Beijing four years ago.

Merritt was forced to pull out of the first heat on Saturday after pulling up with a hamstring problem.

He had intended to turn the page on a disheartening four years that included an embarrassing, 21-month drug suspension.

'It's very disappointing to ... be dealing with an issue and not be able to finish the race,' Merritt said. 'I'll regroup.'

The runner's hamstring issues stem from an injury he suffered last month during a tuneup race in Monaco.

But Merritt is refusing to dwell on his London misfortune, instead concentrating on the next steps for his career.

'It's not the end of the world,' he said. 'The Olympics is going to come around again. Next year is a world championship.'

'We have a season every year. So now it's a matter of getting healthy and getting back to what I love to do.'
