On trial: Teacher Bruce Roth, pictured outside court earlier in his trial, is accused of sexually abusing students 
while working at King's School in Rochester, Kent, and Wellington 
College in Berkshire

A housemaster accused of molesting boys at night at a top public school was previously a pop singer who had toured with legendary DJ Norman Cook, a court heard today.

Bruce Roth, a maths teacher at £30,000-a-year Wellington College, Berks, is accused of sneaking into boys' dormitories in the middle of the night and molesting them as they lay in bed.

A jury was told that Roth, a former target shooter who has taught for 23 years, had a brief pop singing career where he toured with 80's pop band The Housemartins and Everything But the Girl.

The teacher worked with the Housemartins, whose members included DJ Norman Cook - aka Fat Boy Slim - while studying for a physics degree at Hull University.

The 46-year-old keen singer taught maths at Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berks - where old boys include Will Young and impressionist Rory Bremner - and at Kings School in Rochester, Kent.

He is standing trial accused of abusing five boys in instances dating back to 1987.

Roth today fought back the tears at Reading Crown Court as he told the jury how the allegations would have a long term effect on his singing with mixed choirs.

Roth, who also had competed for his country at target shooting and narrowly missed out on a place to compete in the Commonwealth Games, also told how he may struggle to regain his firearms licence.

The former singer has already been suspended from his teaching job, but denies ever abusing a child in his care or being a paedophile.

He claimed that money was a possible motive for the allegations being made up against him, and told the jury that the family of one of the boys planned to sue him and Wellington College for 'large amounts of money' following the case.

A tearful Mr Roth told a jury today: 'I love teaching. I really miss the classroom. I miss all the activities I used to do.'

Alexander Williams, defending, asked Roth whether the allegations he was facing were true.

He replied: 'No they are all false.'

Well-spoken Roth denied being gay, telling the jury he was 'not even bi-sexual.'

Earlier in the trial the jury had 
visited Wellington College, whose master is Tony Blair’s biographer 
Anthony Seldon, to be shown the corridors and dorms where pupils alleged
 they were abused.

During 
the trial, at Reading Crown Court, Berks., young men have testified that
 Roth would molest them as they lay in bed at night, either in rooms or 
dormitories.

One said he was only eight years old when the teacher molested him at King’s School.

Roth, who has taught for 23 years, has already been suspended from his job at the prestigious Wellington College in Crowthorne, Berks

His alleged activities with the five boys came to light when one of the former pupils contacted the charity Childline.

The publicity surrounding the ensuing police investigation then prompted others to come forward and report allegedly  being abused by him.

Roth, whose address cannot be published by order of the court, denies four charges of indecent assault on a male person under 16, four counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

The trial continues.
