Soaring numbers of families are taking the hassle out of preparing the traditional Christmas Day dinner at home by eating out this year.

One million diners are set to be served by a single leading pub and restaurant group alone on December 25th, the latest research shows.

And the study found that the average cost per head of a Christmas Day dinner is highest in London at £56.92 and lowest in Scotland at £47.41.

More than 1,000,000 guests are set to dine out on Christmas Day, a 20 per cent rise on last year's figures

Out of 250,000 meals already ordered in one restaurant, half were not the traditional turkey dish 

With less than a week to go until the big day, research reveals more than one million guests are set to dine out for Christmas lunch.

Pubs and restaurants across the UK have seen a 20 per cent increase as UK consumers plan to dine out on the 25th instead of eating with family and friends at home.

And it's not just the usual venue for Christmas dinner that seems to be changing, but also our choice of festive food.

With the cost if cooking for a family rising to £178 and the stress of timing numerous dishes, many are now choosing to eat at restaurants

Although turkey remains a favourite, according to the 250,000 meals already on order, sales of Chocolate Brownies are outselling the traditional Christmas Pudding, and in Harvester nearly 50 per cent of the meals set to be served will not be turkey.

With a predicted nine hours spent preparing, cooking and clearing away a Christmas Day feast, it's no wonder that Britons across the country have made the decision to ditch the dish cloths this year.

As well as the time spent making Christmas dinner, industry research indicates that it costs the average family £178 to cook at home, put together with the pressure of serving multiple courses to the extended family means chefs at home could be cooking up a lot of stress.

When compared to the average cost of dining out on Christmas Day (£52.58) and the ease of being served in a restaurant it is not hard to see why people are increasingly stepping away from the stove.

Restaurant and pub group Mitchells & Butlers, who conducted the research, has seen increased bookings for Christmas Day, with the top ten booking hotspots from guests in Birmingham, London, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool, Sheffield, Sutton Coldfield, Glasgow, Nottingham and Coventry. 

Catriona Kempston, Marketing Director, at Mitchells & Butlers said: 'We are a nation of bakers, but now more than ever time spent with our loved ones is coming first and though the tradition of cooking at home is still prevalent, the hours that can be given back by dining out this Christmas is outweighing it. 

'Christmas can be a stressful time, taking the drama out of "doing the dinner" could be the best Christmas present you can give someone, and with sales of our gift cards up 34 per cent this year already and £500,000 sales, it seems Seasons Eatings is this year's most popular present to give loved one this year.'
