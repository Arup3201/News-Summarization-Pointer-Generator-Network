He is Pittsburgh's 'street doctor' whose office is his backpack and who treats people where they live.

For 22 years, Dr. Jim Withers has been walking under bridges and venturing into abandoned buildings dressed as a homeless man to care for the city’s rough sleepers free-of-charge.

Now, his extraordinary outreach has grown into a national network of medical trainees and volunteers who help the helpless about five-nights-a-week.

'The Street Doctor': Dr Jim Withers has been treating homeless people in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for free since 1992 dressed as a rough sleeper

'The first thing that hit me was the 
number of people squirreled away under bridges and campsites. The level 
of fear and bitterness towards the medical community and general 
community hit me full blast,' Withers told The Huffington Post.

'As I began to look at the 
medical issues, I began to realize there were people with bad wounds, 
unhealed ulcers, cancers and all kinds of things that weren't being 
addressed.'

Withers' incredible labor of love began in 1992 when he was a hospital specialist.

While he had a strong desire to help Pennsylvania's poor and homeless, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine graduate lacked the street nous to approach them.

After a long search, he teamed up with a formerly homeless man, Mike Sallows, who helped him build trust with the homeless population.

Dr. Withers still remembers Sallows' forceful advice: 'Don't dress like a doctor and don't act like a jerk'. 

So disguised as homeless men and carrying backpacks with free medicine from drug reps, the duo offered their services.

Their story has been beautifully documented by filmmaker Julie Sokolow, which debuted on the website NationSwell on Thursday.

Wide reach: Dr Jim Withers estimates he has treated more than 26,400 rough sleepers over 22 years, including this homeless person

'Literally, I 
started dressing like a homeless person and sneaking out at night with a
 guy who used to be homeless. As far as why, that had a lot more to do 
with my concern for the way we treated other people,' Dr. Withers told The 
Huffington Post.

'As a medical educator, if I could find a new classroom
 where we could be forced to come to grips with people outside the 
system, for me, that required a complete plunge.'

Dr. Withers said he initially faced some resistance from his peers who believed he was risking his standing in the medical community for the sake of his 
vision.

But to the visionary doctor, the need for his services was too great.

He has treated an 85-year-old paranoid man whose legs were so infected, maggots grew inside them; a woman who was diagnosed with cancer several times; and an elderly man who risked losing his eyesight to a treatable condition.

Dr. Withers, a father-of-four, doesn't need to dress like a homeless man anymore.

He has become a hero on the streets of Pittsburgh, and is welcomed by the city's struggling population.

With the support of his loving wife Gayathri, who he married in 1984, Dr. Withers estimates he has treated more than 26,000 people since 1992 and has become well-loved in the local community.

Preparation: Dr Withers packs a range of medications and devices before he hits the road, including cold and flu pills, vitamins and inhalers

Since his initial outreach more than 
two decades ago, the humble doctor has grown his nightly service into 
the nonprofit Operation Safety Net, part of Pittsburgh Mercy Health 
System and one of the nation’s first full-time street medicine programs.

Dr. Withers and 
Operation Safety Net’s 16-member full-time staff of social workers, case
 managers, physicians, nurses and outreach workers have helped thousands of people.

The team has reportedly assisted 75 percent of the people they've treated get health insurance and more than 500 into homes. They have regular patients who are always happy to see them.

Dr. Withers founded the organization in 1993 with a $50,000 start-up grant from the Sisters of Mercy, Pittsburgh Magazine reported. 

'It’s kind of an ongoing adventure to figure out how to make something like this work,' Dr. Withers, an internal medical physician, said.

More than 90 countries have developed similar street medicine units.

Dr. Withers said the free service helps ease pressure on under-resourced emergency medical services and hospitals, while honoring the rights of the disadvantaged.

Inspired by his physician father's missionary work in North America and his idol Mother Teresa,  Dr. Withers believes his work will never be done.

'The power of health care goes way beyond medicine. It changes all the people involved: the homeless become more empowered and they get the courage to get off the streets,' Withers said.

'I think healing is really the formation of community, a community that sees each person as having value. We’re all in this together.'
