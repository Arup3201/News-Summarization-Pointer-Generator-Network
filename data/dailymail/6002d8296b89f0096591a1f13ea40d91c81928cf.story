Foreign owners control much of English football and now the Chinese have bought one of the country's most famous golf courses.

Beijing-based Reignwood Investments have paid £135m to restaurant entrepreneur Richard Caring for the respected Wentworth golf club.

The new owners have said that they will retain the Surrey course's 'unique culture'. The course is the host of the annual PGA tournament.

'Wentworth is a key strategic acquisition for our rapidly growing luxury lifestyle division,' said Dr Chanchai Ruayrungruang, the founder of the group behind the first private golf club in China.

'Reignwood has a long history in golf development and a profound respect for excellence,' he said, adding that his company would use the club's 'exceptional expertise' to help its other golf clubs across Asia.

Richard Caring, himself a keen golfer, revealed that he had received innumerable offers to buy the course during the nine years of his stewardship.

'I have always looked for an owner with integrity... an understanding of the special place it holds in so many people's hearts,' he said, 'an owner who wants to develop the club ever further, improving on what is already a masterpiece.'

Wentworth Club was founded in 1926, the building having been constructed in 1805 on the orders of Culling Charles Smith and Lady Anne Fitzroy, the sister of the Duke of Wellington.

In 1920, George Tarrant began developing the land around the house, Wentworths.

In 1924, Tarrant's friend Harry Colt designed the East Course and three years later the West Course but the timing was poor and in 1931 Tarrant went bankrupt.

The ownership of the land passed to Wentworth Estates Ltd.

The headquarters of the PGA European Tour is located at the club, and each year it hosts the Tour's PGA Championship.

It was the venue of the 1953 Ryder Cup and the World Match Play Championship from 1964 until 2007.

The Edinburgh Course was opened in 1990.

The club is located in Virginia Water, Surrey, one of the most expensive private estates in the London suburbs.

It is home to a number of golfers and celebrities including Nick Faldo and Sir Bruce Forsyth (pictured left on the course during the PGA Pro-Am Tournament).

The club has strict etiquette rules – no tracksuits, leggings or baseball caps worn the wrong way can be worn on its fairways – and a round on the West Course will set you back £360.

Mr Caring who also owns the Ivy restaurant and Annabel's nightclub in London, paid £130m for the club in 2004, meaning that he has made only a small profit on his investment.

It is not just sporting icons  that the Chinese are accumulating. In the summer Chinese private equity group Hony Capital bought Pizza Express for £900m. Chinese firms also hold stakes in Heathrow airport, Thames Water and Weetabix.

Chancellor George Osborne, who said the deal demonstrated the growing relationship between the UK and China. 'Strengthening co-operation between Britain and China is not only good for China, but good for UK jobs and investment too, which is why it's a key part of our long-term economic plan.'
