Muhammad Ali is widely renowned as the best boxer to have ever lived - 'The Greatest' in fact - and he has inspired children around the world to take up the sport.

Perhaps the most impressive professional boxer he inspired is former world champion Mike Tyson, who was feared around the world for his tenacity in the ring.

Tyson, who was never far from controversy during his career, reveals the influence which Ali had on his life during the soon-to-be-released documentary film 'I Am Ali'.

A film about Muhammad Ali's life, 'I Am Ali', is to be released on November 28 in the UK

When spending time in a 'reformatory' - a youth detention centre - in the Bronx, New York, Tyson reveals that he was told he was in for a 'surprise'.

After watching the film 'The Greatest', which stars Ali as a dramatised version of himself, Tyson and the other children were paid a surprise visit by the man himself.

Describing the incident in the film, Tyson explains: 'It's a moment of my life where I just said: "Wow that's awesome. How can I be like that?"

'So I got involved with boxing and I met Cus D'Amato (a boxer and trainer) and Cus was very acquainted with Ali. He would talk to him on the phone and he'd call him up and talk to him.

'Sometimes I would pick up the phone and have a sneaky listen then put it down just so I could hear what they were talking about.

'It was different from my environment (in the Bronx). Everything was fighting, war and the concept of war - it was just the whole thing was different.' 

The film, which accesses Ali's personal audio journals and uses interviews from people close to the now 72-year-old to tell his life story, will be released in cinemas, on DVD and digital download in the UK on November 28.
