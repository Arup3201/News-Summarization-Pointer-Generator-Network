A 72-year-old woman has been sentenced to 420 hours of community service and three years' probation for trying to cut off her husband's penis.

Virginia Valdez pleaded guilty to one count of assault with a deadly weapon over the 2011 attack on Cesar Valdez, then aged 62, at their home in Palm Springs, California. 

The victim said he accepted the plea deal so he could 'move on' but slammed the justice system for not taking his case seriously because he is a man.

Escaped jail: Virginia Valdez, 72, got 420 hours of community service and three years' probation for trying to cut off her then-husband's penis using industrial kitchen scissors during a bitter divorce in 2011

Discrimination? The victim Cesar Valdez, 64, and his attorney Gloria Allred (pictured together) spoke out brandishing an identical pair of scissors to say the case would have been heard earlier if he weren't a man

'There is no doubt in my mind that had I been the aggressor and not the victim my case would have been heard much sooner.

'I am here in front of you today to emphasize that male spouses can also be victims of domestic violence, but in some cases, men are afraid to talk for fear of ridicule or for fear of being labeled as some sort of freak or a wimp,' he said. 

The couple of 32 years were going through a divorce when Mrs Valdez attacked Mr Valdez. 

Mr Valdez called the police after his 
wife's brutal assault as he screamed with pain and tried to stop the 
bleeding using bathroom towels.

'I am here in front of you to emphasize that male spouses can be victims of domestic violence,' Mr Valdez said

'Bitch tried to cut my d*** off,' he told an operator, according to the arrest warrant.

Mrs Valdez had been 'massaging the intimate areas of the victim such as his testicles and inner thigh' when she stopped suddenly, telling him she was going to brush her teeth.

But instead she grabbed a pair of scissors and savagely cut at her husband's penis and 'disfigured the victim's genitals'.

Gloria Allred, who represented Mr Valdez, appeared with the victim outside court to address reporters, brandishing a pair of kitchen scissors.

'This is what was used on his penis,' she said. 'There was a lot of blood coming out of his penis as a result of her attack on him.'

Allred added: 'He feels that if he had been a woman victim of domestic violence that the case would not have been permitted to be delayed for so long and that the punishment for Virginia would have been harsher.'

Mrs Valdez, who had faced a potential nine-year jail term, refused to speak to reporters. 

The former couple are now embroiled in civil suits against one another. 

Sergeant Kyle Stjerne told the Los Angeles Times that Valdez tried to pick the best tool for the job, adding: 'They were more heavy duty than the standard office scissors.'

Mr Valdez was treated at the local hospital for non-life-threatening wounds and was released later that evening while 5ft 4in Mrs Valdez was detained.
