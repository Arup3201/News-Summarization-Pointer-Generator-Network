West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has revealed the club have not given up hope of persuading Winston Reid to sign a new contract, but insisted the player is in control of the situation.

Reid was again impressive as the Hammers drew 1-1 with Everton in their FA Cup third round clash at Goodison Park. where goals from James Collins and Romelu Lukaku ensured the tie will be replayed at the Boleyn Ground in a week's time.

Allardyce had previously said he would rather let the New Zealand defender leave for free at the end of the season than sell him in January, but it appears the club still harbour ambitions to retain his services beyond the summer.

Speaking on BT Sport, Allardyce said: 'It’s still an ongoing scenario with the club. I think that it’s neither one way or the other as far as Winston's concerned, we’ll just have to wait and see. Like every player he's in the driving seat.'

Everton boss Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, was delighted with his team's strength and character, but felt they were unlucky to have a goal disallowed. 

Romelu Lukaku had his header chalked off after a supposed push on Aaron Cresswell, although replays suggested there was little in it.

'It feels very unfortunate not to be able to allow Romelu Lukaku’s goal in a physical game,' Martinez said after the final whistle. 'It was such a physical game. That (the foul) was not at the level that the game was played. It’s a normal contact, it should have been allowed. 

The former Wigan boss was pleased nonetheless, and felt the Lukaku's late equaliser could be a turning point in their season.

‘In the middle of a period where we are low on confidence it was a phenomenal reaction and it could easily be a turning point in our season,' he added.

Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku scored a deserved equaliser in injury time at the end of the second half 

The former Chelsea striker said he hoped this result could be the start of a decent run of games
