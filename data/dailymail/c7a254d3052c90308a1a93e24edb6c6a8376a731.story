Windsor Castle trespasser: Robert Pennefather scaled an eight foot gate while drunk, the court heard

A lorry driver was today banned from drinking in pubs for a year after he drunkenly scaled an eight-foot gate to get into the grounds of Windsor castle

Robert Pennefather, 32, came within 20 yards of the Queen's private apartments in the early hours of the morning.

The Irish truck driver admitted trespassing at the historic palace after drinking with workmates in the town.

He triggered a series of alarms and 
officers from two different forces descended on the historic residence, 
Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

He claimed he had 'got lost' on his way home.

At 3.34am on November 6 police on duty at the castle spotted him on CCTV cameras inside the grounds, 'staggering' around along Cambridge Drive, around 150 yards from an entrance named Cambridge Gate.

Zoe Martin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Pennefather was then identified on CCTV and he was seen staggering towards the area known as South Lawn.'

When challenged by armed police to 
produce his security pass, he replied, 'what pass?', before admitting: 
'Yes, I should not be here.'

'I was with my two mates but they left me outside - they've gone,' he said.

Ms Martin added: 'He said he couldn't 
remember how he had got into the castle grounds, and appeared to 
maintain it was possible just to walk in.

'He said he didn't see any signage and said when officers came he was actually trying to get out.

'At that stage he was approximately 20
metres from the Queen's private apartment, though the Queen wasn't in 
residence at the time.'

Ian Brownhill, defending, said the 
episode had been simply a 'case of drunken folly', and his client had 
been trying to return to his cab to sleep.

'Mr Pennefather, that evening, was incredibly drunk,' he said.

'He quite frankly had had too much, and he found himself stumbling on the way home through Windsor Castle.

'In fact, what he had thought he was doing was taking a shortcut.

'There was nothing sinister in this 
whatever, and there was nothing suggesting Mr Pennefather caused any 
harm whatever to the royal family.'

He added that the married driver, who 
earns £600 per week, wanted to apologise 'to the Queen herself and to 
the Duke of Edinburgh.'

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle gave him a 14-day prison sentence suspended for 12 months.

Pennefather trespassed in the grounds of the royal residence in Berkshire in the early hours of November 6 last year.

Senior District Judge Howard Riddle said he was satisfied that he posed no risk to anyone and had no intention of actually entering the castle.

The Queen was not in residence at the time.

But he added: 'This is a very serious matter as you must indeed be aware.

'There was a significant breach of security.

'It must have caused very significant alarm and distress to those in the castle and those whose job it is to protect those who live in the castle.

'It was not only alarming, it of course caused a deployment of police officers to deal with you when they could have been used in another way.'

Pennefather was also fined £1,000. He was also ordered to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
