The mother of a 20-month-old girl who went missing nearly two weeks in Maine is appealing to the toddler’s father to contact her.

Trista Reynolds told NBC’s 'Today' show on Thursday that Justin DiPietro has refused to talk to her since their daughter, Ayla, went missing in Waterville.

She said she has questions that only he can answer since he’s the last person to have seen her before she was reported missing on December 17.

Conflicted: Trista Reynolds told NBC¿s 'Today' show on Thursday that Justin DiPietro has refused to talk to her since their daughter, Ayla, went missing in Waterville

Father: Justin DiPietro (left) told police he last saw Ayla (right) when he put her to bed the night of December 16. He said she was wearing green pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

'He says he's not in hiding, but why 
won't he come out? Why won't he talk to me? Why is he staying away?' Ms 
Reynolds said during an interview with Matt Lauer.

'What is he so afraid of to not come out or to talk to me?'

Ms Reynolds appeared conflicted asked
whether she believes DiPietro was involved in Ayla's disappearance, and 
questioned his parenting skills.

'Part of me feels yes and a part of me feels no,' she said.

She continued: 'He would never let me
see her. I would call to talk to her and he would get mad about it. If I
did see her and I would notice something on her, like a bruise or 
something, instead or reacting in a calm manner, he would lash out about
it or kind of go into defence.'

Reynolds’ appeal came a day after 
DiPietro issued a second statement, thanking investigators and insisting
that he did nothing to harm his daughter.

'Until now, I have not participated 
in any interviews for I don't want to in any way hinder the 
investigation. However, it is important that the public hear it from me 
personally that I have no idea what happened to Ayla and that I am not 
hiding,' the statement read. 'I have been in full cooperation with 
everyone in this effort, including not adding additional media hype.'

Toddler: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing from her bed the morning of December 17 by her father 
Justin DiPietro

This week, police announced a $30,000
reward for information leading to Ayla’s return and game wardens 
wrapped up their search of woods and streams. Police have received 370 
tips.

Investigators believe the girl was abducted.

'He says he's not in hiding, but why 
won't he come out? Why won't he talk to me? Why is he staying away?'

'At this point in the 
investigation... we are confident that Ayla did not walk out of the 
house by herself,' Waterville police Chief Joseph Massey said at a news 
conference earlier on Monday at which he announced the reward, gathered 
with donations from residents and businesses in the Waterville area.

It is biggest ever offered in Maine for a missing person, state Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said.

Massey said then the developments in a 
mystery that's been featured on national television programs have not 
shifted the matter from a missing-person case to a criminal 
investigation. Despite the passing of the Christmas holiday with no sign
of Ayla, police remain committed to finding her, the chief said.

In tears: Ms Reynolds pleaded for information regarding to her daughter's whereabouts in an earlier television

'The intensity of the investigation 
is as high today as it was the first day,' he said. 'We continue to 
employ every single resource we have.'

Massey was joined at the news conference by Waterville attorney John Nale, who appealed for the safe return of Ayla.

'Until now, I have not participated 
in any interviews for I don't want to in any way hinder the 
investigation. However, it is important that the public hear it from me 
personally that I have no idea what happened to Ayla and that I am not 
hiding. I have been in full cooperation with 
everyone in this effort, including not adding additional media hype.'

Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro

'I ask and I plead with the person or
persons who have Ayla Reynolds that they please keep her safe and 
return her safely to us,' Nale said.

Hundreds of police officers, game 
wardens and local residents have been searching for Ayla since she was 
reported missing by her father, Justin DiPietro, on the morning of 
December 17. Massey said a report about the case on the Fox network 
television program 'America's Most Wanted' during the weekend generated 
some leads, which are being checked by police.

DiPietro told investigators he last 
saw Ayla when he put her to bed the night before at his home in 
Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state
capital, Augusta.

He said she was wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them and had a cast on her broken left arm.

Ayla ended up with her father after 
child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, 
checked herself into a ten-day rehabilitation program.

Address: Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey, at the podium, speaks to members of the media regarding the investigation into the disappearance of Ayla Reynolds at a conference in Waterville, Maine

Reynolds, who completed the rehab, 
had filed court papers that she said she hoped would lead to the return 
of her daughter. The filing came the day before Ayla was last seen.

Appearing on the Today show last week, Reynolds said she blames DiPietro for their daughter's disappearance.

'I trusted him to keep her safe,' she said.

'And now she is missing and I don't 
know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way
he was supposed to.'

DiPietro has said he has 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.'

'I will not make accusations or 
insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove 
who's responsible for this,' he said.

He said last week his family and friends would do 'everything we can to assist in this investigation and get Ayla back home.'
