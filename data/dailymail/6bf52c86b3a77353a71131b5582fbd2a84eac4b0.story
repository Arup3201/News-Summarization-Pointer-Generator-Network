Two young women accidentally killed themselves after they mistakenly swallowed a deadly batch of super-strength party drugs nicknamed 'Dr Death.'

Oil rig worker Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, from Macclesfield, Cheshire thought they were taking Ecstasy but instead took a tablet up to five times more powerful.

They were later found dead inside the terraced house after police were called about concerns for their welfare.

The couple were renovating this end-of-terrace house in Macclesfied in Cheshire when they died

At first it was feared the two women who had carrying out renovation work at their £110,000 house in Macclesfield, Cheshire may have been overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning.

But police quickly ruled it out after tests showed there was no leak of gas inside or outside the house and Ms Clayton's pet Jack Russell dog Jacki was found alive inside the property.

Toxicology results later revealed evidence of the Ecstasy type drug Paramethoxyamphetamine or PMA in their systems.

A post mortem report also found high levels amounts of amphetamine and traces of the party drugs Benzylpiperazine (BZB) and Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) in the blood of both women.

There have 16 deaths from PMA in the UK within the last three years.

The inquest heard that friends of Rachel Clayton, left, and Emma Speed, right, became worried when they failed to answer text or phone messages

At an inquest in Macclesfield, coroner Nicholas Rheinberg recording a verdict of death by misadventure and said: 'It is highly likely they consumed PMA under the false belief it was MDMA or Ecstasy.

'One of the huge dangers of taking drugs is that you don't know what the contents are.'Ms Clayton had owned the house for several years and Ms Speed who had been in a relationship with her for a year had just moved in.

Ms Clayton was on a short break from her job working on a North Sea oil rig and had just bought a new VW Scirocco car and was proudly showing it off to friends on Facebook.

She had joked about the forthcoming Manchester derby in messages on the site, and in a message said of her imminent holiday: 'Home tomoz thank didily I'm becoming a recluse after 3 weeks in the North Sea'.

Her last message was posted on April 5 last year - the last times they were seen alive - after spending the evening with friends.

The couple are believed to have taken PMA, dubbed 'Dr Death' which is available from nightclubs for just £3 (file photo)

Two days later when neither women returned calls or text messages throughout the weekend, friends Neil and Laura Blain, and Darren Oxley, who had a spare key, went to Miss Clayton's house and discovered their bodies on the living room floor.

Police found pink tablets with the Mitsubishi logo on, as well as cocaine and cannabis at the house.Ms Clayton's mobile phone records revealed text conversations with a friend about drugs but the dealer could not be traced.

Toxicologist Dr Simon Elliott told the inquest: 'PMA is a very similar drug to MDMA, but the effects are delayed. What we find is regular users of Ecstasy get a false sense of security, think its a dud and take another and another.' 

Dr Death, often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and has the chemical name PMA.

It is often also referred to as 'Mitsubishi Turbos', 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Dr Death' or 'Pink McDonalds'.

The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet and can be white, but are often pink and usually have the letter 'M' on them, although the initials may vary.]

It is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill and dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy (MDMA) but it is around five times as strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature.The effects also take longer to act than ecstasy causing some users to take pill after pill, leading to fatal doses.

Last year PMA was linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Ireland, Norway and Denmark.

In a statement, Ms Clayton's parents Malcolm and Sue Clayton, of Poynton said: 'Rachel enjoyed life to the full. She was a special daughter and was very family orientated. We will miss her greatly.'

Ms Speed's family added: 'She had a good heart and would do anything for anyone.. She has left a massive hole' in our hearts.'
