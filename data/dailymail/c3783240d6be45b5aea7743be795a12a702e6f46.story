Police found 250 students dressed in bondage gear and flat caps after being called to a jointly-themed S&M and Marks & Spencer birthday party in Newcastle.

While some of the students walked around in skimpy leather outfits carrying whips and handcuffs, others arrived at the packed-out terraced property wearing some of Marks & Spencer's more traditional lines.

The party took place on Saturday at a house in Jesmond, Newcastle, an area of the city favoured by more well-to-do students.

Police found dozens of students dressed in bot bondage gear after being called to jointly-themed S&M and Marks & Spencer birthday party at a packed terraced house in Jesmond, Newcastle

The huge party, organised one month in advance, included a 'chill zone' where there was a 12ft by 4ft ball-pit holding around 3,000 balls (pictured)

According to the Newcastle Tab student newspaper, one of the hosts said afterwards: 'First and last time I give a policeman a tour of my house dressed in gimp gear.'  

Photographs posted on social media showed dozens of students donning various bondage-style outfits, including black lingerie and leather dominatrix gear. 

Another included one of a topless man with an oiled chest who was wearing a leather dog collar and lead.

But some revellers were feeling less outrageous - and opted for flat caps and Marks & Spencer dresses instead. 

Toby Finnis, a second year Countryside Management at Newcastle explained he had chosen the M&S theme because his 'mother loves Marks & Spencer'.

The huge party was organised one month in advance and even involved sound-proofing the house by taping mattresses to the windows.

But police were still called to the house after neighbours complained about the loud noise coming from the property. 

They were then led around the house by a student wearing beige shorts, a bull gag and a leather collar. 

One room in the house had been converted into an 'urban jungle' using leaves, camouflage, signs, strobe lights, smoke machines and music speakers.

Another room upstairs was made into a 'chill zone' with a 12ft by 4ft ball-pit holding around 3,000 balls. Alongside it, there was a bouncy castle with a laptop, inviting music requests.

The organisers - who had DJs playing on decks - even employed a bouncer to man the door and monitor attendees by 'clicking' them in and out.

The party led to a nearby Ann Summers almost running out of its bondage stock.  

Jake Leighton, 20, a Sociology student at Newcastle University, said: 'It was surreal leading a police officer around the house dressed the way I was.

'I was wearing beige shorts, a bull gag and a leather collar at the time. The police officer actually took it all in good spirits.

'He was particularly impressed with the bouncy castle that we had and he said that he would write about us favourably in his report.'

He added that 'a lot of work' had gone in the party, adding: 'There were eight people breaking their backs for three days.

'It was fun and we would like to do it again.'The police were really good about it and I want to make it clear that no action was taken against anyone.

'My memory is a bit sketchy, but I am pretty sure that everyone was gone by about 4am.' 

A police spokesman said that, when officers arrived at around 3am, they asked the group to keep the noise down.

But the students decided to end the party, before leaving in an orderly manner.

The party organiser, who did not want to be named, said: 'We sat down a month in advance and worked out a plan. We completely sound-proofed the house and had people on the door. 

There were so many guests that organisers even employed a bouncer to man the door and monitor attendees by 'clicking' them in and out

Police said they asked the group to keep the noise down and the students agreed to end the party, leaving in an orderly manner

'But as it got late, we said they could go home and that's when the sound started to get out. 

'The police turned up and had a look around. We would do it again but we wouldn't want to upset any neighbours.' 

Officers looked round the house at about 3am on Sunday and found no evidence of criminality.

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said officers were called to the property at 2.43am on Sunday morning.

She said: 'We were made aware of the party from a neighbour, and officers decided to attend. The occupants were asked to keep the noise down and ask people to leave because the music was very loud.

'They were spoken to, and agreed to end the party and everyone left in an orderly manner.

'There were no criminal offences disclosed. It was very noisy, with a large number of people inside.'
