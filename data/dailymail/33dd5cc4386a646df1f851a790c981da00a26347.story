Swansea City are contemplating a bid for Aston Villa’s Matt Lowton with Tottenham pricing Kyle Naughton at £5million.

Garry Monk wants competition for Angel Rangel and Neil Taylor in the full-back positions and Lowton is frustrated with his playing time at Villa Park.

The 25-year-old right-back would be a significantly cheaper option at around £2m, but Villa manager Paul Lambert is reluctant to let him leave despite preferring Alan Hutton this season.

A number of Championship clubs have looked to secure Lowton on loan this window, with Huddersfield and Fulham showing an interest.

But Lambert said: 'I’d be reluctant to let him go. He’s the one who will be the most frustrated because every time Alan Hutton has been out he’s come in.

'But Alan is playing well. Matty has got a good case to go out on loan but I’d be reluctant to let that happen. You can’t let yourself be stretched, although I’ll try to get some in.’

Tottenham defender Kyle Naughton was another target for Swansea but they deem his £5million price too high
