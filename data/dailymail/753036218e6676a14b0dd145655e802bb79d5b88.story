Three astronauts successfully reached the International Space Station this morning, where their six-month mission will include taking the Olympic torch on its first spacewalk.

The arrival of American Michael Hopkins and Russians Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky after a six-hour journey returns the station to its full, six-member live-aboard crew.

Cosmonauts Kotov and Ryazansky will next month carry the Olympic torch into open space as part of the relay of the Olympic flame ahead of February's Winter Games in the Russian resort of Sochi.

The torch will be carried up to the 
space station with another mission next month. But safety concerns mean 
they will not be able to light it when they carry it into the void.

The Olympic torch travels through routes that symbolise human achievement.

One
 previously flew aboard NASA's now-retired space shuttle Atlantis prior 
to the 1996 Olympics, but it has never before been carried outside a 
spacecraft.

Before that passing milestone however, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy face more immediate problems.

The skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week.

But a software problem left the unmanned Cygnus freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station, delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than Saturday.

The hold up was necessary to avoid a 
clash with the arrival of the Soyuz capsule carrying the three new crew 
members. Typically, at least 48 hours are needed between spacecraft 
dockings.

The Cygnus cargo 
ship, built and launched by Orbital Sciences with backing from NASA, 
blasted off aboard an Antares rocket on September 18 from a new launch 
pad on the Virginia coast.

Orbital
 Sciences said the two orbiting vessels established direct contact early
 on Sunday, but the Cygnus rejected some of the data, which interrupted 
the entire rendezvous.

The problem was traced to a difference in data format in the navigation systems of the two spacecraft, the company said.

Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy blasted in a Soyuz capsule off from a launchpad in Kazakhstan last 
night, reaching the space station's Russian Poisk research module at 
2.45am GMT.

They were 
welcomed by Russia's Fyodor Yurchikhin, NASA's Karen Nyberg and Italy's 
Luca Parmitano, who have been on the orbiting lab since May.

Despite the restocking problems, new arrival Hopkins was upbeat about his mission.

During a prelaunch press conference on Tuesday he said: 'As a crew we're very excited to be up there when Cygnus rendezvous and docks and (we're) looking forward to opening that hatch.'

He and Ryazanskiy are space rookies making their first flights. Kotov, who will take over command of the station when his compatriot Yurchikhin leaves in November, has made two previous long-duration missions on the station.

During their five-month stay, Kotov and Ryazanskiy are scheduled to make three spacewalks, the first of which will include taking the unlit Olympic torch outside the airlock.

'Our goal here is to make it look spectacular,' Kotov, speaking through a translator, told reporters.

Kotov added: 'We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work.'

The torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on Nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost. Yurchikhin, Nyberg and Parmitano will then bring it back to Earth when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue.

'Unfortunately we cannot light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the Earth in the background,' Ryazanskiy said in a prelaunch NASA interview.

Shortly after entering the station today, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazansky had a chat via a video-link with their families back at the Baikonur launch pad where they had seen them off more than eight hours before.

Radiant but visibly tired, the astronauts were yawning as they were talking to their families. They had been up for about 20 hours.

Hopkins' mother described the launch as a 'heart-stopping experience.'

'It was a pretty good ride, mom. It was a lot of fun,' Hopkins replied in the live broadcast on NASA TV.
