Ovarian cancer is symptomless in the earliest stages and usually not diagnosed until it is too late, making it the deadliest gynaecological cancer.

There are more than 7,000 cases a year in Britain and 4,300 of these women will die from the disease - around 12 a day.

Frankincense, the resin of the Boswellia sacra – a small tree found in Oman, Yemen and Somalia – is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and has long been used in folk medicine, along with resin from other types of Boswellia.

It is being studied as a treatment for several cancers.

The Leicester University researchers said: ‘Frankincense is taken by many people with no known side-effects.

'This finding has enormous potential to be taken to clinical trial in the future and developed into an additional treatment for ovarian cancer.’
