Pippa Middleton has been leading a dialled-down existence of late, indulging in solo shopping trips and brunches around her West London stomping ground rather than big nights out.

But last night Pippa picked up the pace of London life once more, heading out with boyfriend Nico Jackson for a date night in Kensington wearing a stylish monochrome outfit that showed off her enviable toned legs.

In the first public outing since their romantic trip to India before Christmas, the couple dined at exclusive dim sum restaurant Bo Lang.

Pippa paired a short leopard sprint skirt with black boots and a cream top, shielding herself from the rain with a massive umbrella

Despite the typically erratic British weather Pippa opted for a short animal print skirt which she paired with sheer tights and knee length black suede boots that displayed her slim legs.

However the 30-year-old did wrap up against the wind and rain as she left the high-end restaurant, opting for a chic Notting Hill jacket with fur by Matchless.

Obviously comfortable in Nico’s company, Pippa wore minimal make up and kept her glasses on for the meal.

As with nearly every outing in the past few weeks, Pippa was clutching her favourite £795 Marylebone tote by luxury leather goods brand Aspinal as she left.

Clearly a huge fan of the monochrome bag, made of Italian Saffiano calf leather, Kate’s sister is responsible for a massive surge in demand for the style, which has sold out.

As additional protection against the deluge Pippa opened up a large black umbrella as she made a dash for the car after the meal, followed by a relaxed looking Nico.

Seemly unperturbed by the inclement weather, the 36-year-old stockbroker wore a grey suit jacket over a navy jumper and white polo shirt.

Also electing to wear suede on his feet despite the rain, Nico wore blue suede shoes and jeans.

Despite dating for over a year and having enjoyed a number of romantic trips together the couple are rarely seen out together in their home city of London.

This is the first sighting of the pair since they arrived back from their trip to India on 10 December, looking relaxed and tanned when they were photographed just after touching down at Heathrow.

The pair stayed at the Oberoi Amarvilas, a five-star resort with views of the famed Taj Mahal, where a luxury suite costs £1,600 a night.
