Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit can take virtual tours of some of the novel’s locations thanks to a new interactive map by Google.

While the book famously has a hand drawn map of Middle-earth, it has now been brought to life and lets people take a tour of the fictional landscape from the air, as well as through a Hobbit’s eyes.

The interactive map allows people to dodge trolls in Trollshaws and water plants in Rivendell in mini games as well as come across wizards and other beasts on their travels.

The Hobbit novel famously has a hand drawn map of Middle Earth but has now been brought to life and lets people take a tour of the fictional landscape from the air, as well as through a Hobbit¿s eyes. To enter different locations, users click on the rings, pictured

As well as promoting the film THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, which arrived at cinemas in December, the interactive map is designed to showcase Google’s Chrome browser.

The map incorporates audio passages from the book and biographies of characters, while there are many scenes that users of the site can seemingly ‘walk around’ as well as what seems to be Elvish music to make the tour a little more magical.

In each location, users of the website can play mini games and battle villains such as the trolls as well as meet wizards and water plants

To enter the three locations currently available – Trollshaws, Rivendell, which is home to the Elves and Dol Guldur, which is Sauron's stronghold in Mirkwood in Middle-earth, - users hover at cloud-level above the map, but once they enter the place it is as if they are the height of a Hobbit.

In any given location, a person can learn the relevance of a place such as Rivendell, an Elven outpost in Middle-earth, which means 'deep valley of the cleft' and find out who lives there via an explorable render of the place.

Welcome to Rivendell: At any given location, a person can learn the relevance of a place such as Rivendell, an Elven outpost in Middle-earth and access character information and a mini game

The interactive map is designed to  show how fast detailed images like this can load. Galadriel is 'the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle Earth' and the 'greatest of elven women,' Tolkien writes

The app showcases computer languages CSS3 and WebGL, which are designed to work particularly well in Google’s Chrome operating system and Android devices.

In a blog post, Daniel Issakson, a technical expert who was involved in the project, said: ‘The whole experience is based on a map of Middle-earth and the locations and characters from the Hobbit movies.

'Using WebGL made it possible for us to dramatise and explore the rich world of the Hobbit trilogy and let the users control the experience.’

In order to escape the clutches of the trolls, users must use a combination of their keyboard and mouse and see the trolls from a Hobbit's point of view

The computer scientists used ‘low-poly models’ to make sure download time for each scene was not too long, but that graphics still looked as much like the film as possible.

They found they could increase the complexity ‘quite a lot’ without affecting performance too much so that each 3D model of a troll ended up with around 5,000 faces and each scene with around 40,000 faces.

Middle-earth is the fictional setting of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.

Tolkien's map of Middle-earth shows only a small part of the world; most of the lands of Rhûn and Harad are not shown on the map, and there are also other continents.

Middle-earth is meant to be located on our earth in an imaginary period in our planet's past.

The Shire is meant to be northwestern Europe and Hobbiton was set at the same latitude of Oxford.

In the Second and Third Ages, during which Tolkien set the events of the The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings, the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of Eriador, Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and the vales of the great river Anduin.

The term Middle-earth - also commonly referred to as middle world - was not invented by Tolkien.

It occurs in Early Modern English as a development of the Middle English word middel-erde.

Tolkien first encountered the term middangeard in an Old English fragment he studied in 1914: 'Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent unto men', which is from the second of the fragmentary remnants of the Crist poems by Cynewulf.
