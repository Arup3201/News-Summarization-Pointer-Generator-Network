Chelsea are top of the Premier League but it is Southampton who have impressed me most so far. Chelsea strengthened their squad; Southampton had the heart ripped out of theirs.

As well as selling Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert, Southampton lost their chief executive Nicola Cortese and their manager Mauricio Pochettino. 

But they are once again punching above their weight — they sit fourth in the table before Saturday's tricky trip to Swansea — and their nightmare summer is fast becoming a distant memory.

Their new signings have impressed me. Ronald Koeman is a bit of a journeyman, having been in charge with varying degrees of success at Valencia, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Feyenoord, Vitesse and AZ Alkmaar but he is well respected and hugely knowledgeable. 

Bringing Graziano Pelle with him from Feyenoord looks a masterstroke. The Italian striker already has four goals this season and is not dissimilar to Lambert: big and powerful with a good touch.

Behind him Dusan Tadic, brought in from Twente, looks a really good player. He spots people’s runs, plays clever through-balls and already has two assists to his name. Pelle and Tadic’s form has prompted me to watch a lot of Dutch football in the past fortnight. Players seem to get an excellent grounding over there.

While those two have hit the ground running, Shaw has yet to play for Manchester United, Lallana has made a slow start at Liverpool and Lambert is stuck on the bench.

Losing Lovren hurt. But two of Koeman’s back four in the win over Newcastle — Toby Alderweireld and Ryan Bertrand — have played in a Champions League final. Add Fraser Forster in goal and you can see why they are flourishing. 

Koeman’s team are already having more shots, making more passes and tackles and scoring more goals per game than Pochettino’s last season. So yes, they had the icing ripped off their cake this year but they’ve just replaced it with a thicker, tastier one.

Another good call by Koeman was bringing in Sammy Lee as his assistant. I always found him very enthusiastic on England duty and he is receptive to foreign ideas, having worked with Gerard Houllier at Liverpool.

There is still an English core to the squad too, which is crucial. Nathaniel Clyne is thriving at right back and is someone Roy Hodgson might like to look at. James Ward-Prowse is a huge talent in midfield and Jay Rodriguez is still to come back from injury. Those players and Morgan Schneiderlin will have found it devastating to see so many players leave in the summer but good results will change that.

So what would be success for Southampton this season, a campaign in which many tipped them to go down? If they could match last season’s eighth-place finish, it would be remarkable; a minor miracle after selling so many stars. But don’t bet against them doing just that.

PS 

I’d demand more of Yaya Toure if I was playing with him. There are occasions when he doesn’t ask enough of himself to get back and defend. But a lot of it is about fitness.

When I was at Arsenal it would take me five or six games to get match fit. Sol Campbell was a bit of a slow starter, too.

Yaya Toure wasn't at his best on Wednesday night as Manchester City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich

I think it’s the same with Yaya. He doesn’t look match sharp yet but he’s not far from it. He’s such a big, powerful player, so he asks a lot of his body when he uses that pace to get up and down the pitch.

He could have worked harder against Bayern for the team but keeping him on the pitch will have helped — you build your fitness through the games.
