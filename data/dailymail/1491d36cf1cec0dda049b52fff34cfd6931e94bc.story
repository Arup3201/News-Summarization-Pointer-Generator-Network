All smiles: Sebastian Vettel (left) won last year's Belgian Grand Prix for Red Bull ahead of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (right) and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton

Inter-team battle: Formula One returns from a summer break at Spa with Hamilton (front) trailing Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (back) in the drivers' championship by just nine points

Settle for third: Hamilton pipped Rosberg in Hungary last time out but finished third behind Ferrari's  Fernando Alonso and race winner Daniel Ricciardo (left) for Red Bull

* Daniel Ricciardo’s win in Hungary last time out means he remains the only driver to score a win this season aside from Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.

* In finishing third in Hungary, Hamilton now has 63 podiums to his name (1st: 27; 2nd: 18; 3rd: 18), the most by any British driver in F1 history.

* Mercedes have won nine of the 11 races this season. Only five teams have scored more in a single campaign - Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Benetton and Williams. 

King of Spa: Michael Schumacher has won the most amount of Belgian Grand Prix with six and made his F1 debut at Spa with the Jordan team in 1991

One to watch: Kimi Raikkonen is the most successful of the current drivers at Spa, winning four times with his most recent victory coming in 2009  - his most recent win for Ferrari

* Ferrari and McLaren have now gone 25 and 30 races without a win respectively.

* With just two exceptions (2003 and 2006 when the Belgian GP was not held) the race has been staged at Spa-Francorchamps every year since 1985. This will be the 47th F1 grand prix held at the circuit.

* The leader in the title race after Hungary has only been overhauled four times in the last 14 years, but three of those have been in the last seven - Michael Schumacher reeled in Mika Hakkinen in 2000; Kimi Raikkonen did it to Lewis Hamilton in 2007, while Sebastian Vettel closed down Mark Webber in 2010 and Fernando Alonso in 2013.

Drivers' favourite: The uphill Eau Rouge corner is one of the more challenging corners on the circuit

* The most successful driver at the Belgian Grand Prix is Michael Schumacher with six wins, followed by Ayrton Senna with five.

* Ferrari are the most successful constructor in Belgium with 16 victories to McLaren’s 14. Both, however, have won the race a dozen times at Spa-Franchorchamps.

* There are five Belgian Grand Prix winners entered this weekend. Felipe Massa won in 2008, Hamilton in 2010 and 2012, Vettel in 2011 and 2013, whilst Kimi Raikkonen has four victories to his credit in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

* Raikkonen’s first win at Spa came from a starting position of 10th, although that is not the lowest grid slot from which victory has been achieved as Schumacher’s 1995 win was from 16th.

* The circuit has a 75 per cent risk of a safety car deployment, placing it in the ‘very high’ risk category.
