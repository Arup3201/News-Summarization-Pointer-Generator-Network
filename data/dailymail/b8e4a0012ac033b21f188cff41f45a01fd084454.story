The girlfriend of a security guard has been found guilty of helping him steal boots from the Premier League club where he worked - so that he could use them play Sunday league football.

Tanya Cotton, 24, stole Nike footwear worth £200 belonging to Scottish midfielder Graham Dorrans from West Bromwich Albion’s training ground on August 29 last year.

Her boyfriend, Aaron Hinds, admitted taking kit from the Premier League star as well as trainers owned by player James Morrison, 27, when he pleaded guilty to two charges of theft and one of burglary last November.

The 25-year-old was handed a 12 month community order with 200 hours unpaid work at Walsall Magistrates Court.

His girlfriend, Cotton, pleaded not guilty to the theft at the time but was found guilty at the same court yesterday.

The court heard that the Premier League club decided to install CCTV cameras because items kept going missing from the training ground in Great Barr, Birmingham.

Hinds was then caught on camera selecting boots before passing them to Cotton who put them down her leggings and pulled her jumper over the top.

After realising that the boots were not well hidden enough, Cotton handed the shoes to her boyfriend and helped him conceal them before the pair left the room.

The court heard that Cotton, of Birmingham, had been 'stupid' because she had believed Hinds when he told her that he was allowed to borrow the boots.

Prosecutor Mark Rees told the Justice of the Peace (JP): 'The defendant was in the boot room with her boyfriend Mr Hines.

'Because there had been items going missing from the training ground CCTV cameras were installed which show Hines selecting boots and passing them to Miss Cotton.

'She then stuffs them down her leggings and pulls her jumper over the top.

'After realising the boots are not concealed, she hands them to Hines and helps him conceal them and the two then leave the room.

'The defendant was interviewed and insisted she had not taken anything from the ground, which is true, but she helped her partner to take them.'

Cotton said: 'Aaron said he was allowed to borrow the boots and I believed him because I have known him for five years and I've been his girlfriend for two years'

Giving evidence, Cotton said Hinds had told her he intended to borrow the boots before concealing them inside his jacket.

She added: 'Aaron said he was allowed to borrow the boots and I believed him because I have known him for five years and I’ve been his girlfriend for two years.

'He asked me to hold a pair of boots 
and told me to put them down leggings which I did but then I took them 
out and handed them back to him.

'I
 am aware of how it looks on the footage but at the time I did not 
question him because I trust him. I had no intention of stealing 
anything.'

Cotton was found guilty of theft at Walsall Magistrates Court and will be sentenced on Monday.

Chairman of the bench Richard 
Dewis said: 'The video footage did not make it clear that Miss Cotton 
did not want to steal the boots.

'She was a willing accomplice and we find her guilty as charged.'

At
 a hearing at the same court in November, Hines admitted taking the 
boots belonging to midfielder Dorrans, 26, as well as trainers owned by 
star player James Morrison, 27.

He was caught on CCTV taking keys to the ground’s laundry room where he also stole one of the club’s t-shirts in a clear bag.

JPs were told Hinds planned to use the kit to play football - because he could not afford to buy his own.

The father-of-one, from New Oscott, West Midlands, was given a 12 month community order with 200 hours unpaid work, and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
