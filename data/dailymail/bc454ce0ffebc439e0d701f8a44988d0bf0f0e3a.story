Several passengers became ill when a commercial jet carrying more than 200 people was rocked by strong winds during a ‘horror flight’ in Australia.

The turbulent conditions prevented the Cathay Pacific flight from landing at Melbourne Airport, so it was forced to divert to Avalon Airport, southwest of Australia’s second largest city.

But passengers who went through the unsettling experience were stranded on the plane for several hours after the aircraft made a safe landing. 

Bumpy ride: Several passengers became ill after a Cathay Pacific flight was rocked by strong winds

Passengers said the Airbus A330, flying from Hong Kong to Melbourne, diverted after two aborted landings at Melbourne Airport late Saturday night.

Ted Szkuta told radio station 3AW that the plane was ‘rocking severely’ as it attempted to land.

He said: ‘I started feeling a bit seasick. It was very uncomfortable.’

After the plane made a smooth landing in Avalon, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection did not allow passengers to disembark, Mr Szkuta told the radio station.

Rattled passengers remained on the aircraft for over four hours – they lost an hour to daylight saving time – but two were allowed to leave with paramedics due to medical conditions.

Mr Szkuta said: ‘One person had a bit of an issue of, I think, claustrophobia or something because they gave the woman oxygen.’

Stranded: The passengers were stuck on the plane for over four hours before it returned to Melbourne Airport

The plane refuelled and was inspected by technicians before it flew back to Melbourne Airport, where it landed around 6am on Sunday – nearly seven hours behind schedule.

Passenger Simon O’Dea saluted Cathay Pacific staff for the way they handled the situation.

He said on Twitter: ‘@cathaypacificAU want to commend your staff at Melbourne check in for today's HK flight, so professional and helpful in difficult situation.’

Airservices Australia spokeswoman Vicki Huggins told the Herald Sun that two other planes were affected by severe winds and had to circle Melbourne Airport before landing.
