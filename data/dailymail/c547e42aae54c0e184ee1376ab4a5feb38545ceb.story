Australian travellers looking to make a quick buck online from their Qantas Lounge invitations have been stopped in their tracks by eBay, who are banning the resale of the passes on their site.

Vendors on trading sites such as eBay have been posting the exclusive cards for the Business and First Class lounges online for years, with many frequent flyers making a nice penny from the transactions.

However eBay have now forbidden the sale of the club invitations, claiming it infringes upon their travel policy.

Two  Qantas Club invitations are on sale for Gumtree for $150. eBay has prohibited the resale of the invitations on their site

In the past. Business Class Qantas Lounge passes typically sold for around $50, while First Class Lounge passes could easily be traded for up to $100 online. 

However, according to eBay's website, the sale of 'club memberships, including service, cards, or identification numbers that gives the holder the right to free or discounted travel or some other travel-related benefit' is now prohibited.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Qantas Corporate Communication Manager Tom Woodward said that Qantas relies on eBay to enforce their travel policy on their website.

He said it was 'unfortunate' that there were no names printed on the Qantas Club invitations and it is good news that eBay are 'cracking down' on the illegal trading of the passes.

'Qantas lounge passes can be transferred to family and friends but are not for resale. It's positive that eBay is enforcing this through its own policy,' he said. 

Speaking to News Corp, eBay Australia Communications Manager Megan English said the company's filters catch out a lot of people who are trying to resell the sought-after passes. 

The resale of the exclusive passes is still allowed on Gumtree. Passes can go for anything from $45 - $150

'These passes are prohibited under our Travel Policy. Our filters capture a lot of these kinds of listings and they are removed,' she said. 

The complimentary invitations to the Qantas Lounges are sent out to silver Qantas credit card members as a reward for flying with the airline. 

They are valid for only one visit to the international and domestic lounges.

Although, people scouring the internet on the hunt for other sites selling the passes won't have to look far, as  popular classified ad site Gumtree still has the passes for sale.

Just over an hour ago, a user posted a single use entry card into the Qantas Lounge for $60. Another vendor posted up five international domestic lounge passes for a whopping $375. 

However, as eBay was acquired by eBay in 2005, it is likely the passes will not be on the website for much longer.
