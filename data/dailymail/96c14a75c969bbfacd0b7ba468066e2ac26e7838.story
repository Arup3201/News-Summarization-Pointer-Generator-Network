Tens of thousands of North Koreans have been forced to work overseas in slave conditions in order to feed money back to Pyongyang to buy luxuries for Kim Jong-Un, a new report reveals.

The impoverished labourers have  been found working on sweltering construction sites in the Middle East,  in deadly mines where locals refuse to go, or in a chain of Pyongyang restaurants.

Human rights campaigners say Kim's greed for the finer things in life, and his mbitions building projects for Pyongyang, mean the practice is on the rise as the need for steady cash rises.

North Korean workers were found toiling on the Lusail City construction site in Doha, Qatar, due to host the 2022 World Cup. Asked why they were there, one said 'to earn money for our government'

The workers are often paid as little as 300 roubles, or £3.18, per day with most of this confiscated from them, according to a report by the North Korean Strategy Center.

They are ferried to and from work by bus, are kept under armed guard, and at night are locked away in safe houses so they cannot escape, the report says.

While the practice has been commonly employed to raise money for the cash-strapped communist nation since the 70s, it is on the rise again thanks to Kim's greed for luxury good.

Ahn Myeong-chul, head of Seoul-based human rights group NK Watch, told the New York Times: '[Pyongyang] is exploiting their labour and salaries to fatten the private coffers of Kim Jong-Un.'

'We suspect that Kim is using some of the money to buy luxury good for his elite followers and finance the recent building boom in Pyongyang that he has launched to show off his leadership.'

In 2014 a group of 50 North Koreans were found helping to build Lusail City, the lavish development in the Doha desert, Qatar, which will eventually host the 2022 World Cup final.

According to the Guardian, the men work tirelessly day and night, keep less than 10 per cent of the meager wage they earn, and have  been provided with a room to rest in on site so they don't have to leave when taking breaks.

They are contracted out by Office 39, a shady North Korean fundraising outfit that has exported as many as 100,000 such workers in recent years.

Russia has been named as the biggest recipient of North Korean labour with at least 20,000-25,000 workers in the country. 

There were an estimated 15,000 workers in the Middle East and the same number in South East Asia. China and Africa had up to 8,000 each.

A North Korean was also killed working in a coal mine in Sarawak, Malaysia, last year, after which another 46 were discovered working on the site.

Defending the decision to employ them, deputy home minister Datuk  Jaafar said they were 'brave, dedicated and tough' and willing to do jobs local labourers considered too dangerous.
