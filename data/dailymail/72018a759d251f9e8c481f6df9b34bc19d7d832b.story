FIFA president Sepp Blatter has today apologised for his controversial comments on racism in football after David Beckham and David Cameron waded into the row.

The under-fire head of football's world governing body said he was sorry - but was adamant he would not resign from his role.

Speaking to the BBC, the 75-year-old said: 'It hurts and I am still hurting because I couldn't envisage such a reaction.'

Eye of the storm: Blatter posted this picture of him hugging South Africa's black football chief Tokyo Sexwale in 2009 which has only fuelled the racism row

'When you have done something which was not totally correct, I can only say I am sorry for all those people affected by my declarations.'

Despite people from the world of politics and football calling for Blatter to step down, he said he had no intention of resigning.

'I cannot resign. Why should I? When you are faced with a problem you 
have to face the problem. To leave would be totally unfair and not 
compatible with my fighting spirit, my character, my energy.'

Criticism: Beckham described Blatter's comments as 'appalling' and said some things 'can't just be sorted out with just a hand shake'

His apology comes after former England captain Beckham and the Prime Minister both waded into the row strongly condemning the FIFA president's comments.

It follows a picture being posted on the FIFA website of 75-year-old Blatter hugging black South African football chief Tokyo Sexwale as he tried to back-track from his claim there is no racism in football.

This morning, LA Galaxy player Beckham echoed the Prime Minister's condemnation yesterday, describing the comments as 'appalling' and said some things 'can't just be sorted out with just a hand shake'.

The former England captain insisted the statement had been damaging to the sport.

The FIFA president also became embroiled in an amazing Twitter row with Rio Ferdinand, who accused him of being 'ignorant'.

Mr Cameron said: 'It's appalling to suggest that racism in any way should be accepted as part of the game.

'A lot of work has gone into ridding racism from all aspects of our society, including football. As many of our top sports stars have rightly pointed out, now is not the time for complacency.'

Meanwhile, the airline Emirates told MailOnline they may not renew their £122million FIFA sponsorship deal when it expires in 2014.

Emirates
 are one of FIFA's six official partners and are concerned their brand 
has been damaged by Blatter's remarks and the widespread outrage and 
offence he has caused.

Blatter dismissed racism as a problem on the football field, arguing 
that any such incident should be settled with a handshake at the end of 
the game.

He compounded the situation by 
comparing racist abuse to foul play. 'It's foul language, it's foul 
play,' he said.

An Emirates spokesman said yesterday: 'Emirates continues to closely watch 
developments within FIFA ahead of discussions on the extension of our 
partnership beyond 2014. However, we have no role in the management of 
the organisation.'

The 
Dubai-based airline had previosuly expressed concern about its relationship with
 FIFA in the wake of the cash-for-votes scandal.

Boutros Boutros, the 
Emirates vice-president, said: 'We are seriously thinking about not 
renewing our partnership with FIFA beyond 2014. We don't get into 
politics but we believe the situation with FIFA went beyond an internal 
problem and became much bigger.'

Blatter's friend is Mosima Gabriel Sexwale, known as Tokyo Sexwale, after Japan's capital city, because of his love of martial arts.

Why does deal with the FIFA president?

Sexwale is the Minister of Human Settlements in South Africa and worked with FIFA on projects to highlight the battle against racism and apartheid.

Why does he do that?

He went into self-imposed exile to the Soviet Union to fight apartheid but was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government when he returned in 1976. He was sentenced to 18 years on Robben Island, where he met his wife. He was released in 1990 and served under Nelson Mandela as the premier of Gauteng province.

Anything else?

He owns Mvelaphanda Holdings, the world's third biggest diamond company, and hosted South Africa's version of The Apprentice.

At this stage FIFA's five other partners - Adidas, Hyundai, Coca- Cola,
 Visa and Sony - have chosen not to condemn Blatter's comments, even 
though they were invited to by Sportsmail.

They did make their stance against racism clear.

But it could be the fear of losing 
major sponsors that threatens Blatter's position more than the criticism
 he continued to receive yesterday, even though it came from some hugely
 influential figures in football. Most staggering was the Twitter 
exchange with Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand.

His younger brother Anton is at the centre of the John Terry race 
inquiry and Ferdinand attacked Blatter on Wednesday night for posting a 
picture alongside a statement on the FIFA website of himself with a 
black football official and South African politician.

In an unprecedented move by Blatter, he 
responded directly to Ferdinand. 'The "black man" as 
you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work 
against racism and apartheid in Africa.'

Ferdinand tweeted back: 'To say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject.'

Having suddenly found himself a pawn in the race storm, Sexwale held a press conference in Johannesburg today, at which he seemed to support Blatter, saying: 'We should distinguish racial remarks from things that are said when players are fighting for a ball.'

As Cameron made his comments increasing 
the pressure on Blatter from Westminster, Mr Robertson echoed his 
sentiments saying: 'Sepp Blatter's comments are completely unacceptable.

'This is the latest episode that calls into question whether this man should be the head of world football. For the sake of the game, he should go.'

While the Premier League and the FA reiterated their stance against racism, there was no direct attack on Blatter.

But Ferdinand was joined by a number of Premier League managers in criticising Blatter. Tony Pulis, Martin Jol and Mick McCarthy were united in their feelings, with McCarthy calling the FIFA chief 's comments 'outrageous'.

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor says Blatter's remarks were 'the straw which broke the camel's back' and that he should step aside for UEFA president Michel Platini.

Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said he had been surprised by the comments but stressed both FIFA and UEFA had done much to combat racism in football. Boyce said: 'I was very surprised to hear the president's remarks but have been pleased that both he and FIFA have come out to try and clarify the situation.'

The controversy started when Blatter 
was asked directly by a CNN reporter if racism exists on the pitch, 
Blatter denied it and said such incidents should simply be settled by a 
handshake at the end of the match.

'I would deny it,' he said. 'There is
 no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards another, he has a 
word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is 
affected by that, he should say that this is a game.

'We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands, and this can happen.

'On the field of play sometimes you 
say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game 
you have the next game where you can behave better.'

To a reporter from Al-Jazeera he simply compounded the situation.

'During a match you may say something
 to somebody who is not exactly looking like you,' he said. 'But at the 
end... it's forgotten.'

He later released a statement 
saying: 'I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight
 against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in 
society.

'I have been personally leading this 
battle against racism in football, which FIFA has been fighting against 
throughout the past years through campaigns in all of our competitions 
such as the 'Say no to racism' campaign.

'I also know that racism unfortunately continues to exist in football, and I have never denied this.

'My comments have been misunderstood.
 What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, 
you have 'battles' with your opponents, and sometimes things are done 
which are wrong. But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologise 
to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake 
hands, and when the game is over, it is over.

'Anyone who has played a football match, or a match in any sport, knows that this is the case.'
