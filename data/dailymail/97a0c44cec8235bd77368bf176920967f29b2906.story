Bec McDonald was due to fly home from a holiday in Europe on MH17 last week

An Australian student who was due to fly home on MH17 and changed her booking at the last moment has spoken about her terrifying near-miss.

Bec McDonald, 20, from Geelong in Victoria was on a month-long Contiki tour through Europe that ended in Amsterdam last week.

The Deakin University psychology student was booked to return to Melbourne on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was believed to have been blown out of the sky last Thursday by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew.

Days before the flight, Ms McDonald's brother, who is a travel agent, suggested she take the free connecting flight offered by Contiki to London, from where she could get a cheaper flight to Melbourne.

Ms McDonald flew home from London on Thursday at the same time MH17 was believed to be shot down over Ukraine. She learnt of the tragedy during her stopover in Kuala Lumpur.

While she was waiting to board her flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne, Ms McDonald's brother messaged her to inform her that the plane that had been shot down was the one she had originally been booked on.

'I didn't realise the gravity of it until I got home and my family were really overwhelmed to see me. It was definitely scary,' Ms McDonald told MailOnline.

'I was quite scared to get on a plane normally. I've never flown more than five hours before and I was by myself.

'Everyone says, "You'll be fine, it's so unlikely that anything will happen." And to know that happened while I was in the air, it was pretty scary.'

Ms McDonald's stepmother passed away late last month while she was travelling. Ms McDonald said she couldn't imagine the impact it would have had on her family if she had been on board MH17

Ross McDonald, Bec's father, said he was 'very emotional and shaking' when he saw news of the plane crash in the middle of the night and immediately got up to check his daughter's travel documents to make sure she was safe.

The fear was even more pronounced for Mr McDonald, because he had lost his wife, Bec's stepmother, late last month while Bec was overseas.

'It's been a tough period of time for us,' he told MailOnline. '[Bec and I] are very close and I was looking forward to her coming home and to find out she was almost on that flight was overwhelming.

'What should have been moments of relief turned to thoughts of "What if?" and "What would that mean for our family?"

'I hate to have thought what the outcome would have been.'

Ms McDonald said she had debated going to Europe, given her stepmother's condition, but her stepmother had told her to go and live her life to the full.

She said that she felt someone, perhaps her stepmother, was watching over her.

'Someone's got to be looking after me. What if I did get on that plane? Someone's guiding me, I know that sounds corny, but that's how I feel,' said Ms McDonald.

Ross and Bec McDonald said their hearts go out to the families and friends of those on board the flight.

'I can't even begin to imagine how they feel,' said Ms McDonald. 'It would just be so devastating and I just wish them so much love and support.

'It's just horrible, it shouldn't happen.'Â 

Ross McDonald said he was 'very emotional and shaking' when he learnt of the crash and immediately looked up his daughter's travel documents to make sure she was no longer booked on MH17
