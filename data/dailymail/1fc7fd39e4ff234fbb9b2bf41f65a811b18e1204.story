David Cameron today said he is 
‘profoundly shocked’ by child porn allegations against a senior aide and
 close friend, as he was forced to defend Number 10 from claims of a 
cover-up.

Patrick Rock 
resigned from the Government almost three weeks ago, after the Prime 
Minister was told of the potential offence and detectives from the National 
Crime Agency searched No 10.

But
 the allegations only came to light last night after they were revealed 
by the Mail, forcing the Government to defend its secrecy.

Downing Street today also confirmed that Mr Rock had been the subject of an earlier complaint about 'inappropriate behaviour' by a colleague. The outcome of the complaint is unclear.

Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured today) said he was 'profoundly shocked' by allegations against his firend and aide Patrick Rock, he resigned from Number 10 before being arrested

Mr Rock was hired by his old friend Mr Cameron as deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit in 2011.

His work included drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters.

Number
 10 first became aware of allegations against Mr Rock on February 12, 
when it called in the National Crime Agency and informed the Prime 
Minister.

Mr Rock resigned and in the early hours of February 13 was arrested by the police.

Officers then entered Downing Street and were given access to government offices and IT systems.

However the incident has only become public almost three weeks later.

Speaking
 at an event in the West Midlands today, Mr Cameron said: ‘Obviously 
when I heard these allegations I was profoundly shocked and I remain 
profoundly shocked today. 

‘In
 terms of the release of this information, I don't think it would be 
right to pre-emptively brief out a criminal investigation and that's why
 we did not do that but as soon as questions were asked, as questions 
would inevitably be asked, we have given very full and straightforward 
answers,' he told ITV News.

‘I was told about 
this issue pretty much as soon as it was discovered. I've been very 
clear that we must handle this in an absolutely correct way and I'm 
satisfied that that is what Number 10 Downing Street has done.’

Born Patrick Robert John Rock de 
Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading 
Tories for four decades.

But
 despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated 
Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, 
despite being selected to fight safe seats.

Rock,
 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West 
London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of 
his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de 
Besombes.

His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms.

As
 a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in 
Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he
 studied history.

After 
graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence 
secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing 
director of the Retail Consortium.

It
 is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he 
used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, 
which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote.

After
 losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a 
by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth 
South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000.

Rock
 was 'absolutely 
certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second 
and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third.

But
 after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the 
Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset
 for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher.

Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'.

He
 blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs 
Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was 
not his fault. The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative 
Research Department.

He 
later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department 
of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron.
 The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on 
the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they 
agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'.

Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected.

He
 also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the 
responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser
 at Downing Street.

Colleagues
 describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. 
Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'.

Today
 Downing Street confirmed a separate sexual harassment complaint was 
made against Mr Rock and had been dealt with ‘very seriously’.

However, it is not thought to be connected to the more recent allegations linked to child pornography.

Mr
 Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Downing Street was first made aware
 of a potential offence on the evening of February 12.

‘It was immediately referred to the National Crime Agency and the Prime Minister was also immediately informed.

‘Mr Rock resigned and then in the early hours of the 13th he was arrested.’

He
 defended the decision to contact the NCA direct, rather than the Met 
Police, insisting it is ‘responsible for issues relating to child abuse 
images’.

However, at a briefing of journalists today Number 10 faced repeated questions about why it was kept secret.

‘This
 is directly linked to a police investigation and I don’t think we would
 pro-actively comment on this,’ the PM’s spokesman said.

‘When a question was put to us we responded, obviously subject to the constraints to there being a police investigation.’

He also denied that Mr Rock’s colleagues in the heart of government had been told he was ‘off sick’.

‘It
 is not correct to say that Downing Street staff were told he was off 
sick,’ he said, but he refused to say how his absence from Number 10 was
 explained.

Mr Rock was a 
protege of Margaret Thatcher and has held a series of senior posts in 
the Conservative Party. He has been close to Mr Cameron for many years.

Described
 as the Prime Minister's 'policy fixer', the unmarried 62-year-old had 
been tipped as a leading contender for a Conservative peerage only weeks
 ago.

His arrest and 
resignation from Downing Street, where he has worked since 2011, has 
sent shockwaves through the party's high command.

One
 well-placed source said Mr Rock had also been the subject of a sexual 
harassment complaint from a civil servant working in Downing Street, 
which is understood to have been passed to Mr Cameron's chief of staff 
Ed Llewellyn.

The PM’s spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that a complaint around alleged inappropriate behaviour was raised.

‘The
 matter was dealt with very seriously at senior levels in full 
accordance with the Cabinet Office's human resources policy,’ the 
spokesman said.

However, Number 10 would not go into details about the outcome of the complaint.

Mr Cameron's relationship with Mr Rock goes back to the Home Office, where they both worked under Michael Howard in the 1990s.

Mr
 Rock, who has repeatedly tried to become an MP, is known in Westminster
 for coining the phrase 'Cows moo, dogs bark, Labour puts up taxes' used
 by the Tories in the 1970s.

The
 Prime Minister brought him back into Downing Street in 2011, a move 
welcomed by critics as heralding the return of a 'grown up' to the 
centre of government.

In the
 No 10 policy unit, he has taken a particular responsibility for home 
affairs issues and has also been involved in drawing up the Government's
 measures against internet pornography and child abuse imagery.

In
 a crusade spearheaded by the Prime Minister, Downing Street brokered a 
deal with internet firms which means that all 20million households 
connected to the internet are being contacted and asked whether they 
want family-friendly filters installed.

Downing
 Street also persuaded Google and other search engines to introduce 
changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results 
for more than 100,000 searches.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Rock, who lives in West London, had been involved in the policy.

'Patrick
 Rock was one of a number of advisers and officials involved in dealing 
with this issue – but the work was led by somebody else, and decisions 
were taken by ministers,' a spokesman said.
