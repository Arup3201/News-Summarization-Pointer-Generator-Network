The father of England star Jordan Henderson has revealed he kept his battle with cancer secret so it would not affect his son's football performances.

Brian Henderson, 59, was diagnosed with the disease in his tongue and throat in November and needed life-saving radiotherapy.

But he delayed breaking the news to his son during a crucial part of Liverpool's season for fear he would put the midfielder off his game.

Mr Henderson's battle with cancer came at a time when his son's club, Liverpool, were trying to win the Premier League and Jordan was vying to get in England's World Cup squad

Mr Henderson only told his son just before he was about to have surgery earlier this year and his treatment has now been declared a success.

He has now told how Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the Merseyside club supported him and his family through his battle with the disease.

He said he told Jordan, 24, to make him proud by putting in as many man of the match performances as he could and his son rose to the challenge.

He had the cancer of his throat and tongue removed and after gruelling radiotherapy treatment is now on the road to recovery.

Mr Henderson, a retired police officer, said: 'It was a very emotional time when I had to break the news to the family.

'I went to speak to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool who was very understanding. He gave Jordan time off, and the people at Liverpool were amazing. They were very understanding and gave him a lot of support.'

He said the thought of his son playing for England in the World Cup helped him through the cancer battle

He added: 'I said to Jordan that the best thing he could do for me when he got back to playing was try to get man of the match in every game.

'People didn't realise the pressure he was under. I was so proud of him.'

Medics discovered a tumour in Mr Henderson's neck when he was having a cyst removed in November and tests revealed he had carcinoma of his throat and a tumour on his tongue.

The grandfather and his wife Donna, 40, a social worker, held off telling Jordan and Mrs Henderson's son Kyle Cunningham, 22, until after Christmas.

Mr Henderson, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, had surgery to remove lymph nodes in both sides of his neck and the tumour from his tongue, leaving a hole the size of a 50p piece.

Mr Henderson lost four stone during chemotherapy, which he described as the 'worst thing I've ever had in my life'.

Determined to make his father proud, Jordan got man of the match three times last year.

Brian was still recovering from his treatment when the World Cup started and was unable to go to Brazil to watch Jordan play.

He added: 'He was really looking forward to the tournament and was buzzing about it. That helped me through, I knew it could change his life.

'He was disappointed by the outcome but it was an experience for him.'

Mr Henderson is due to speak at a conference for the survivors of head and neck cancers at Sunderland FC's Stadium of Light next month.
