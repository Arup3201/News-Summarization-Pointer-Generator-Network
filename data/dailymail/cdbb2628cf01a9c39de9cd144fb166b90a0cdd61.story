Lord Feldman, the man allegedly behind calling Tory grassroots supporters 'swivel-eyed loons,' has been a loyal presence at David Cameron's side for thirty years.

Yet he never gives interviews, has never stood for elected office, and is virtually unknown outside Westminster.

But now, it is the sheer strength and longevity of Cameron's friendship with Lord Feldman which makes the furore so damaging for the Tory leader because it is widely assumed their views are shared.

Centuries old: Tennis partners: David Cameron (back row, far right) and Andrew Feldman (back row, 2nd left). The pair first established their rapport as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have remained extremely close since then

The pair first established their rapport
as students at Brasenose College, Oxford, in the mid-1980s and have 
remained extremely close since then.

Profiles of the peer usually describe the 47-year-old as either as 'Mr Cameron's tennis partner' or 'the PM's oldest 
political friend' – fuelling critics' claims that the Government is 
being run by  a socially elite clique of old 'chums'.

The impression is enhanced by photos of them as young men, posing for the college tennis club team 
(the pair are circled, left) and standing next to each other at the 
summer ball, which they had helped to organise – Lord Feldman was chairman of
the committee, while Mr Cameron booked the entertainment.

So who is who is Lord Feldman of Elstree, and how has he become so close to the seat of power?

Born into a well-off family, he went to Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Hertfordshire, where he won a place to study Law at Oxford.

It was at Brasenose College, Oxford, that he met Cameron.

They organised a college May ball together and discovered they had a mutual love of racquet sports (another similarity shared between tennis-playing Tony Blair and Lord Levy).

Lord Feldman urged Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005

Since those college days, the friendship has been cemented, with Mr Cameron describing Lord Feldman as ‘one of my oldest and best friends’.

Scandal: Feldman's most serious brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht Queen K

Like Cameron, Lord Feldman got a First in his final exams; then he took a job with management consultants Bain & Co. before, in 1991, being called to the Bar and practising as a commercial barrister at one of the country’s top chambers.

His family owns Jayroma, a multinational textile company making ladies’ clothes, and in 1995, aged 29, he joined the firm, drawing a salary of £900,000 in one year alone.

It meant he was able to buy the £3million house in Holland Park, West London, where he lives with his wife Gaby and their three children round the corner from David Cameron’s house in Notting Hill.

Tory figures describe Lord Feldman as likeable, friendly, extremely bright and unassuming. He skis regularly, enjoys yoga, and owns another house in Andalusia, southern Spain.

It was Lord Feldman who not only urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership as the dark horse candidate when Michael Howard announced that he was handing on the baton in 2005 after the party’s third successive general election defeat, but also masterminded his campaign.

Lord Feldman helped run Mr Cameron’s bid with ruthless efficiency, calling in favours from his network of contacts in the business world and raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process.

Through his family clothing firm, Lord Feldman himself donated £10,000 to the successful cause.

He was appointed deputy treasurer of the party in 2005, and – ironically given the circumstances today – immediately let it be known that he wanted to end the dependency on major donors.

‘He’s not comfortable with individuals giving large amounts. He wants a wider base of people giving smaller amounts,’ said a party official at the time.

But even before the Conservatives got into power, Lord Feldman made the wrong call.

In 2007, he was chairman of the Leaders’ Club, a dining group for Tory donors who each gave a minimum £50,000 to party funds each year.

They would have lunch or dinner in Mr Cameron’s office in the Commons and meet senior Tory politicians.

But this arrangement was in breach of Parliament’s rules, which do not allow party-political fundraising in the House of Westminster, and Mr Cameron was forced to ‘unreservedly apologise’ after he was rebuked by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Sir Philip Mawer.

In 2008, Lord Feldman was appointed chief executive of the Tory Party and was given specific responsibility for attracting party donors.

Until now, Lord Feldman's most serious 
brush with scandal came in 2008 when he was entangled with George 
Osborne in the 'yachtgate' saga: both Feldman and Shadow Chancellor 
Osborne were guests on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's yacht off Corfu when
Mr Osborne was accused of soliciting for a £50,000 donation to the 
party – at a time when Feldman had been given responsibility for 
'widening the party's fundraising base'.

Donations
from foreign nationals such as Deripaska are illegal and Mr Osborne 
insisted neither he nor Lord Feldman had discussed donations with the 
Russian, and the storm passed.

In
January Lord Feldman said 'I did not know who Mr Deripaska was. I was going 
over because I had been invited, and it’s a human weakness I’m afraid 
because I was fascinated to see this boat. I had never seen a boat of 
that size close up.'

Rise: After the Tories entered Government in 2010, Feldman was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year became Baron Feldman of Elstree

in 2010, he was made co-chairman of the party and later in the year 
became Baron Feldman of Elstree.

Lord Feldman's
key party roles mean he will have been privy to some of the most 
closely guarded secrets of the 'Cameron project' from the outset – no 
doubt reinforcing the Prime Minister's feelings of personal loyalty.

Lord Feldman's importance to Mr Cameron, 
who has publicly described him as 'one of my oldest and best friends', 
was emphasised when he was tasked with 'prepping' the PM for his 
appearance at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.

He played the role of Robert Jay, the counsel for the inquiry, by 
peppering Mr Cameron with likely questions about his relationship with 
newspaper owners.

Colleagues regard the peer as 'virtually
indispensable' to the Prime Minister. 'He is direct, easy-going and has
an extremely sharp business brain,' says one.

'Plus, he is one of the few people around Cameron who can talk to him on the same level. Cameron values that. It would take a minor earthquake to shift him from his side.'

Lord Feldman, one of the Prime Minister's closest friends and political allies, was accused of making the 'swivel-eyed loons' remark to journalists at a London hotel.

They reported that an unnamed 'close ally' of the Prime Minister blamed Tory activists for pressuring MPs to take hardline stances on Europe.

They said he stated: 'There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the [Tory] associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.'

But yesterday afternoon, after crisis talks with Mr Cameron, and amid growing claims on Twitter that the unnamed person was Lord Feldman, the peer issued a statement, saying the allegations against him were 'completely untrue' and he was considering legal action.

'I did not, nor have ever, described our associations in this way or in any similar manner. Nor do these alleged comments represent my view of our activists,' he said. 'On the contrary,  I have found them to be hard-working, committed and reasonable people, the backbone of the party.'

Mr Cameron fully backed Lord Feldman. A No 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister supports Lord Feldman's position. It is categorically untrue that anyone in Downing Street made the comments reported in The Times and the Telegraph.'

Both The Times and The Daily Telegraph stood by their reports. A source at  News International, which owns The Times, said: 'There is no doubt Feldman used the words loons and swivel-eyed.'

A titanic trial of strength between No 10 and the two newspapers now seems inevitable. Defeat for Feldman would force him to resign and could inflict potentially catastrophic damage to Mr Cameron.
