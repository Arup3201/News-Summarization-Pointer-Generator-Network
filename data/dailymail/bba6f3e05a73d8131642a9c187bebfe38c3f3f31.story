A 49-year-old Virginia man's trip to the beach turned tragic Monday when he died after being buried alive in the sand.

David Frasier of Fredericksburg, Virginia was spending the day with family at the beach in Salvo, North Carolina on Hatteras Island when the accident happened.

Authorities say the man had built two 6-foot-deep holes in the sand when he tried to connect them with a tunnel that afternoon.

But by the time he tried to connect the two, the sand had dried and it collapsed on him.

Frasier was buried for 10 to 15 minutes before emergency workers could reach him.

A registered nurse visiting the beach tried to revive the man without luck and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

National Park Service spokesman Cyndy Holda says its been 10 years since someone in the area suffocated in collapsed sand.

'It is rare,' Ms Holda told the Virginian-Pilot. 'It's probably too deep to be safe if you are using a shovel.'

According to statistics obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 561 people died across the country in similar circumstances between 1999 and 2010.Â
