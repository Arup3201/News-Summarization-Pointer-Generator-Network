A sweet shop is offering one lucky customer a cracking treat: an Easter Egg the size of a washing machine

The massive egg weighs a hefty 15lbs (6.7kg), stands three and a half feet tall, and contains a whopping 40,000 calories. 

It was made by a French chocolatier and was delivered in the same size box as a washing machine.

The egg is being raffled for charity by Mr Simms Olde Sweet Shoppe in Horsham, West Sussex.

Manager Joseph Crouch said: 'I just think it is phenomenally how they make an Easter egg that big.

'It came in the box the size of a washing machine.

'I decided to do this as I have worked with the Dame Vera Lynn Trust since I have had the shop and I just wanted a statement for the store this Easter.

'Easter is the time of year for sweets and chocolate and new beginnings and is a very important time for sweet shops.

'So I thought let's try and get the largest Easter egg Horsham has ever had.'

Customers have to purchase raffle tickets from the shop where they will be entered into a prize draw to win the giant Easter treat.

The winner will be announced this Saturday and Mr Crouch promises to deliver the egg in time for Easter Sunday - as long as they live locally.

This year's Easter celebrations have seen some rather over-the-top products on offer. 

A family butcher in the Scottish borders has come up with a new way to eat Creme Eggs - inside a Scotch egg.

Greig Foston and Benjamin Webb say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli-flavoured pork.

Foston's Fine Meats in the village of Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop's Easter offering.

For just £1.85 you too could could enjoy the Cadbury's Creme Egg surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs.

Mr Foston explained: 'We always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on.'

And it's not just eggs which have got a makeover as even bunnies are joining in the fun.  

Hand-carved from luxurious 75 per cent Tanzania Origin chocolate and measuring approximately 38cm high, this Easter bunny - available from luxury launches website VeryFirstTo.com -  took two days to make and costs a whopping £33,000.

The sumptuous sculpture, which weighs in at approximately 5kgs and contains 548,000 calories, has eyes of two solitaire diamonds with a combined value of £25,000, nestled into the chocolate.

The luxury chocolate rabbit was carved by award-winning Chocolatier and International Pastry Consultant and former Chef Decor of Harrods, Martin Chiffers.

If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs.

Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds).

Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. 

Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature.

Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C.

Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. 

Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. 

You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. 

Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.
