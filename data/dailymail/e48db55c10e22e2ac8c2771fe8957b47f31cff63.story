The parents of two teenagers in Georgia have been charged with child cruelty after police found the boys were found living in deplorable conditions in a home covered in feces and cockroaches.

Greg and Jackie Tate of Gwinnett County were arrested on Friday after local police saw first-hand the conditions that their 15- and 17-year-old sons had to endure.

‘You could see just roaches and flies just all over the place when you're walking through the house,’ said Snellville Police Detective Orlando Concepcion.

The home, which has been condemned, has running water and electricity, but no working toilets, according to police

‘It just hits you in the face. I can't imagine putting my kids into that,’ he told KTVU.

Animal Control officers were first called to the home on Friday after receiving a report about a number of cats running around the property.

Authorities seized 11 cats and then notified state welfare workers about the shocking conditions they found inside the home.

Photos taken by authorities show dishes piled high in the kitchen and trash on the floors.

According to the police report, officers found roaches and other insects on counters and floors, while cat feces and urine was everywhere.

Another photo showed a stained mattress on the floor with trash and dirty clothes piled high. When investigators pulled up the mattress, roaches and fleas scuttled out from underneath.

‘There was no working air conditioner 
unit and the family managed to function with window fans,’ the report 
states. So with the combination of feces and hot air, the smell was 
unbearable.’

‘It just makes you sick to your stomach,’ Concepcion said. ‘Once you get to the front door - just the aroma from inside - feces and cat urine, it just knocks you out.’

The local health department posted imminent health hazard warning signs on the property.

Neighbors told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution they were shocked to find out about the conditions as outwardly the family appeared respectable.

Both boys appeared healthy and were attending school. They've been removed from the home and placed with their grandparents. 

‘They appeared to be unaffected by the amount of clutter and said they had been lazy, which is the reason the house is the way it is,’ wrote one officer in the police report.

Gregory and Jackie Tate were being held as of Tuesday night on $5,700 bond each at the county jail. The mother had been a school bus driver until earlier this year.
