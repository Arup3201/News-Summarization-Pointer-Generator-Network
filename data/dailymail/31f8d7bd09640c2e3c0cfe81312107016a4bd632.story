In the history of unlikely unions, Yorkshire and the Tour de France must be up there with Shane Warne and Elizabeth Hurley, Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts, and Lembit Opik and one of the Cheeky Girls. 

One local MP has called this Grand Depart ‘the biggest thing to happen to Yorkshire since the industrial revolution’, and that is the sense one has in Leeds, which on Friday evening will host the teams’ presentation in the Leeds Arena, and on Saturday will witness the official start when the 198 riders roll out of the city en route to Harrogate.

This is the most distant and northerly Depart — a year after the most southerly, in Corsica — in the Tour’s 111 years.

Yorkshire have embraced the honour in a way never seen before.The Tour colours — yellow, green and red polka-dots, representing each of the three main jerseys — are everywhere, decorating Yorkshire farms and even sheep. The county has caught yellow fever, with pubs adopting French names and Indian restaurants offering ‘naan Brad’, though the Brad being honoured, Wiggins, will be missing. 

France’s elite police force, the Garde Republicaine, will escort the race in Yorkshire, and on Wednesday they cruised in on their gleaming blue motorcycles, along  with  Tour director Christian  Prudhomme and five-time winner Bernard Hinault, France’s last champion, 29 years ago. 

Just as predictable as another year without a French winner is a pre-Tour drugs scandal, and on Wednesday it was duly delivered. Daryl Impey, the South African who rides for the Australian Orica-GreenEdge team, confirmed he tested positive for probenicid at his national championships in February. 

Impey, who had a spell in the yellow jersey last year, released a statement saying that he aims to clear his name. ‘I had no knowledge of probenecid nor have I ever taken the substance knowingly in any manner,’ he said.

Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart, with Froome looking to retain his yellow jersey

Chris Froome, Britain’s defending champion, is a former team-mate of Impey, having ridden with him on the Barloworld team in 2008-09. They also know each other from South Africa, where Froome spent his formative years. ‘It was quite shocking this morning to hear the news about Daryl,’ said Froome. ‘It’s always harder when you know someone on a personal level.’

Froome has had his own problems in recent weeks. An illness at the Tour de Romandie in early May meant he raced on medication that would normally be banned, but which was allowed thanks to a therapeutic-use exemption.

Then he crashed in his last outing before the Tour, the Criterium  du Dauphine, and suffered with the after-effects.

‘I’m more or less recovered,’ he said on Wednesday. ‘I took quite a big knock to my left hip and there was a bit of underlying bruising there. I felt for the next week after the crash I just wasn’t quite pedalling as I normally would.

‘It did take me a good week to get back into things, start seeing the same power readings as I would normally expect and be the normal me again. It was a reminder that anything can go wrong at any time, especially this first week of the Tour. It’s always a stressful environment being in the peloton over the first few days. I think given Yorkshire’s narrow, twisting, undulating roads on the first couple of stages it’s going to make for some pretty hairy racing.’

Froome leads a strong Team Sky line-up, albeit one without Wiggins. ‘Just to make absolutely clear, I do not have a role in selection,’ said Froome in response to a question about his famously frosty relationship with the 2012 Tour winner. 

Wiggins’ presence would ‘not necessarily’ be uncomfortable, added Froome, but ‘it would definitely change the dynamic having Bradley on the team. That’s bike racing: you’re not always going to be best friends with everyone on the team all the time.

‘The team that I have got around me,’ he added, ‘I would say it is probably the strongest team that Team Sky has fielded at the Tour de France.’
