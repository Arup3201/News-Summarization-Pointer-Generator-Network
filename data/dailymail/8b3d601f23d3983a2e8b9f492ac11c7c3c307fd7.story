The family of Thomas Kinkade, the successful painter who died earlier this month, has filed a restraining order against his live-in girlfriend.

They want to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago.

His ex-wife Nanette fears Amy Pinto-Walsh will attempt to sell her story and could release private family photographs.

Battle: The 'painter of light' Thomas Kinkade, one of America's most popular artist, died at the age of 54 after struggling with alcoholism, a family member said

Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life'

Kinkade was one of the most 
successful artists in the U.S., but he struggled with alcoholism before 
his death at the age of 54, and split from his wife Nanette in 2010.

The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America.

His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is 
the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court 
seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos 
Patch.

Its attorneys argue that the 
painter's mistress, who is still living in his mansion in Monte Sereno, 
California, is planning to disclose information which would breach a 
confidentiality agreement signed in February 2011.

Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said

The restraining order would ban Ms 
Pinto-Walsh from saying or doing anything which would make Kinkade, his 
wife or his business 'appear in a negative light or false light'.

She would also be prevented from 
writing or contributing to any sort of book, article or other 
publication about the late artist.

In particular, the lawsuit seeks to 
stop her divulging personal information which she found out 'as a 
personal assistant and companion to Thomas Kinkade'.

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)

While it is not clear what exactly 
prompted the legal battle, the suit alleges that Ms Pinto-Walsh told a 
family friend that she intended to sell the story of her relationship 
with Kinkade and release unseen photographs of the painter.

The suit continues: 'The release of 
these items would be personally devastating not only for Mrs Kinkade, 
but also for the family's four daughters, who are grieving the sudden 
loss of their father.'

The family also fears that Ms 
Pinto-Walsh could jeopardise Kinkade's business empire, which relied on 
the production of prints and reproductions as much as original 
paintings.

They say she had access to 'trade 
secrets' such as the artist's painting techniques and computer 
programmes, and could try to sell them on to others.

Ms Pinto-Walsh, who had been in a 
relationship with Kinkade for 18 months before his death, told Los Gatos
Patch at the time that the painter 'had a heart condition'.

Mrs Kinkade's lawsuit cites this 
revelation of a 'non-public health condition' as one breach of Ms 
Pinto-Walsh's confidentiality agreement.

The suit also says that Kinkade died 
on the night of April 5, which contradicts previous reports that he was 
found dead the next morning.

While the artist was phenomenally 
successful and extremely wealthy, he apparently suffered from a drinking
problem throughout much of his life, and in June 2010 was arrested for 
drink-driving.

He was also saddened by constant attacks on the quality of his work by art critics, and devastated by his divorce from Nanette.
