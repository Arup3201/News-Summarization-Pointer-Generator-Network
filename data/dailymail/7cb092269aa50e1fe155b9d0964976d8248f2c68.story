The model accused of killing a British millionaire in Spain had been extradited to face questioning over the alleged murder.

Mayka Kukucova, the ex-girlfriend of victim Andy Bush, was flown to Madrid yesterday after authorities in her native Slovakia handed her over to Spanish police.

Investigators in the Costa del Sol - where Mr Bush, 48, was shot dead at his mansion in Estepona last month - hope to question the suspect over the weekend.

Extradited: The model has been transported from her native Slovakia to Madrid for questioning

After being interrogated by murder police Kukucova, 24, will be handed over to an investigating judge who will decide whether to remand her in custody or release her on bail.

She handed herself in to police in Slovakia following an international manhunt for her in the wake of Mr Bush's death on April 5.

Kukucova spent around six weeks in custody before yesterday's decision to extradite her.

She was flown from the Slovak capital Bratislava to Vienna early yesterday morning, and was expected to arrive in Madrid in mid-afternoon.

She will be escorted to the nearest police station on arrival in Madrid to be fingerprinted, and will then either be taken for questioning in Estepona or held in Madrid before travelling to the Costa del Sol next week.

Suspect: The 24-year-old is accused of shooting Mr Bush dead during a row at his Costa del Sol villa

Mr Bush's current girlfriend, Maria Korotaeva, has told Spanish detectives Kukucova was waiting inside his rented villa and opened the door to them after they flew to the Costa del Sol to celebrate their five-month anniversary together.

The 21-year-old student at the University of the West of England said she heard shots and a row after leaving the ex-lovers inside the house to argue - and saw his ex flee moments later with the keys to his 4x4 which was later found abandoned nearby.

She found his body on the living room floor after firefighters forced their way in following her desperate emergency call.

Investigators say Mr Bush was shot twice with an Italian-made .38 special revolver.

Couple: At the time of his death, Mr Bush had started a relationship with student Maria Korotaeva

Witness: Miss Korotaeva said she left the room shortly before Mr Bush was shot dead in April

Claims: Mr Bush's new girlfriend said that his ex was madly jealous and described her as a 'snake'

Russian-born Miss Korotaeva has described Kukucova as being madly jealous, and said her boyfriend had to change all the locks at his house in Bristol after splitting with her last year.

She claimed in an interview shortly after the killing: 'Andy hated her with a passion. She was like a poisonous snake.'

Kukucova, who has not yet been charged with any crime, is expected to claim that she shot Mr Bush in self-defence during an argument.

Her lawyer in Slovakia said yesterday: 'I haven't been officially informed about her extradition yet by anybody.

'Due to this situation I cannot provide you with any details of the handover.

Grief: Relatives of Mr Bush pictured at the site of his killing in Estepona, on the Costa del Sol

'She will be represented by one of my colleagues who is recognised as one of the best criminal lawyers in Spain.'

However, sources close to the case in Spain confirmed she had been extradited.

Mr Bush's body is still in Spain and a judge has refused his family permission to repatriate it to Britain.

Relatives and friends have launched an online petition against the decision.
