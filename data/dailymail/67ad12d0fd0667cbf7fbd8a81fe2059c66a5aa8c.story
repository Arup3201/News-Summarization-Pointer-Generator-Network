Two-thirds of Australians support Prime Minister Tony Abbott confronting Vladimir Putin over the shooting down of MH17, a week after he pledged to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the tragedy.

The latest Newspoll has found 63 per cent backed Mr Abbott taking a tough stance against President Putin at a G20 meeting in Brisbane next month, while only 27 per cent opposed it.

The prime minister grabbed global headlines after pledging to shirtfront Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting, comments he later backed away from.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will question Russian leader Vladimir Putin face to face at the G20 summit

Australia has imposed trade bans on Russia and expressed his anger over Russia's support for separatists who shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight where 38 Australians were killed

Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the 'murder' of 38 Australians who died when MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine.

Labor's lead over the government also increased according to the poll published by The Australian on Tuesday, with its two party preferred vote rising two points to 53 per cent.

But Labor leader Bill Shorten's disapproval rating hit its highest ever level at 46 per cent. 

The coalition's overall support fell to a three-month low, with its two party preferred vote falling to 47 per cent.

Mr Abbott remained the preferred prime minister with 39 per cent support, compared to Mr Shorten on 38 per cent.

Mr Abbott's vow to 'shirtfront' Mr Putin prompted a barrage of insults back from a Russian news site.

After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next month.

As the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending, Mr Abbott said.

Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin.

But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart.

'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' the prime minister said last week.

'I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.'

Speculation over the exact meaning of 'shirtfront' soon ensued on social media following the Prime Minister's comments, but was soon revealed to be a slang word for an aggressive and now illegal 'front on bump' in Australian Rules Football.

Mr Abbott also said he would  demand that Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation into the MH17 disaster and if evidence is required from the nation, it should be provided.

Labor leader Bill Shorten says the MH17 tragedy was 'an act of murder' and he would not give Putin the 'light of day'
