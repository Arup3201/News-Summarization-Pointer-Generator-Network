A shocking video shows the horrifying moment a Russian driver repeatedly runs over her elderly neighbor in a rage after the older woman scratched her brand-new Nissan.

Marina Skhurina, 37, is seen struggling to reverse her new car out of a yard after a heavy snowfall when her neighbor comes out her house with a bowl of food for her chickens.

The footage shows Skhurina becoming increasingly frustrated as her car moves backwards and forwards in the snowdrift at the end of the road in the  town of Aldan in Russian region of Yakutia.  

Reusing to wait for her neighbor to pass, the driver shoots forward down the narrow lane, forcing the older woman to step to one side. She is seen dropping the bowl as the car pushes past her.

The neighbor struggles to recover the corn husks from the snow-covered ground, and then topples over when the furious driver steps out of the car and starts shouting at her.

Skhurina then continues reversing backwards and forwards down the lane, running the older woman over repeatedly in the process.

Unable to move, the woman jerks in shock each time the wheels pass over her. The ordeal only ends when the driver reverses so far back that she spots her neighbor.

But instead of rushing from the car to help her neighbor, the driver gets out and shouts at the helpless woman, before kicking snow in her face.

She did eventually call for help, but claimed that she had not noticed that her 67-year-old neighbor had fallen over.

The driver admitted she was angry that her brand-new Nissan Qashqai had been scratched but insisted she did not realize that the woman was there.

An ambulance which was called to take the woman to hospital said that incredibly she had only suffered slight injuries thanks to the deep snow which cushioned her.

Police said they are considering charges against the car driver.
