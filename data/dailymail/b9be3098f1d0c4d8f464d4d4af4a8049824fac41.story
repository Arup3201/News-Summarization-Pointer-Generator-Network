They were criticised for trivialising the heroism of the First World War and for reinforcing the popular notion that British troops were ‘lions led by donkeys’.

But Blackadder, Darling, Baldrick and George might be surprised to learn that they did exist - and that the fictional characters they portrayed in the long-running TV series bore some striking similarities to the real thing.

Research by military genealogy website Forces War records has revealed that the central roles played by Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Laurie, Tony Robinson and Tim McInnerny had namesakes that truly did ‘go forth’ for king and country.

Real-life George: Cambridge-educated Lt Athelstan Key Durance George was a descendant of William the Conqueror

Century ago: A poignant notice about the wounding of the real Lt George - during 1914 at the Battle of Mons

Not only were there counterparts of the same name and rank in the 1914-18 war, but some shared almost parallel backgrounds.

The
 real-life version of Laurie’s twittish public school and 
Cambridge-educated Lieutenant George, for example, was a 
Cambridge-educated descendent of William the Conqueror.

And
 Atkinson’s Blackadder, it transpires, might easily have fought 
alongside his namesake at the Somme – both joined the Army in the late 
1800s and rose through the ranks.

The
 fact-versus-fiction discoveries were made by 24-year-old Forces War 
Records and military history graduate Tom Bennington in the run-up to 
the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

The only major character absent from genuine records was General Melchett (Stephen Fry) - the general doesn’t surface in the records until the Second World War.

'Millions have died, but our troops have advanced no further than an asthmatic ant with some heavy shopping'

Although the Blackadder series won prestigious awards and widespread acclaim, it drew condemnation for its anti-war, anti-officer undertones, perhaps salvaged by satirical musings about the nature of conflict and an unusually deep, final question by the profoundly stupid Private Baldrick: ‘Why can’t we just say “no more killing, let’s all go home?”

Historians and Education Secretary Michael Gove recently complained that the series, still shown in schools to help children learn about WWI, trivialised the valour and sacrifice that defined it.

Or, as Blackadder once put it: ‘Millions have died, but our troops have advanced no further than an asthmatic ant with some heavy shopping.’
