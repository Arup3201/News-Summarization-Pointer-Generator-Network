Americans are falling in love with weddings again.

While marriage rates have plummeted to historic lows during the economic recession, a backlog of couples keen to tie the knot is expected to fuel a surge in weddings over the next two years.

A new report from private provider of lifestyle analytics, Demographic Intelligence, forecasts a four per cent rise in the number of marriages from 2009 as the economy improves - up from 2.168 million this year to 2.208 million in 2015.

I do: Marriage rates are expected to rise about four per cent over the next two years after plummeting to historic lows due to the recession

Marriage rates in the U.S. have been falling in the last 40 years

The marriage rate is at its lowest point in more than a century, with the number of weddings falling from 2.197 million in 2007 to 2.08 million in 2009. 

In 2007, just before the downturn, the marriage rate was a low 7.3 per 1000 population.

It's currently just 6.8.

Demographic Intelligence estimates more than 175,000 matrimonial exchanges have been postponed or 
foregone since the recession began, with couples putting off the white wedding until financial conditions improve.

But the report says the 'signs are right for a temporary boost in weddings', according to USA Today.

Improving economic conditions and financial security are not only encouraging long-term couples to finally take the plunge, but pairs from different demographic backgrounds.

According to the report, marriage numbers are stagnant or declining among those with a high school education or less, younger Americans, and the less affluent, but 'short-term increases in weddings will be concentrated' among women aged 25 to 34, the college-educated and the affluent.

'Declines in weddings are likely to set in towards the end of the decade, even though the number of young adults is increasing, because of the nation's ongoing retreat from marriage,' the report says.

The report also predicts brides and 
grooms heading to the altar over the next couple of years are likely to 
be older than in the past.

The average age at first marriage is expected to rise to 29.2 for men and 27.1 for 
women by 2015 - up from 28.2 and 26.1 respectively in 2010.

'We're 
anticipating that for both men and women, it (the average age) will 
continue to keep rising at least for the next decade,' Demographic Intelligence president Sam Sturgeon told USA Today.

Sturgeon said it won't be too long before the average marriage age 
for U.S. men reaches 30, matching European trends.

Marriage rates are expected to increase as the economy improves

Hopkins Population Center director and sociologist Andrew Cherlin said the forecasts 'make sense'.

'Given the drop in marriage rates, it's surprising to see a group project an increase,' he told USA Today.

'If you're going to get married in time to have kids, you can't wait forever, so they may be saying that the postponement of marriages is running its course, and a backlog of young adults is about to schedule their weddings.

But National Center for Family & Marriage Research co-director Wendy Manning said the projected wedding increases 'might be overly optimistic'.

'Not all those marriages are going to be among those young people entering into their first marriages,' she said.

'The report is focusing on the Echo Baby Boomers entering into their marrying years, which is true, but my issue is that one-third of marriages are remarriages, and the remarriages are not among the young people.'
