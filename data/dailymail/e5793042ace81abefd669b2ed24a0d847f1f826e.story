Abrupt ending: Lee Eddins, 12, battling leukemia since February, passed away on Thursday one day shy of fulfilling a long-time dream of meeting his favourite basketball star

For 12-year-old Leukaemia patient Lee Eddins, meeting NBA star Roy Hibbert was to be a dream come true.

Just one day before the Indiana Pacers player planned to visit him at a hospice centre in Sacramento, California, the boy's memorable farewell was lost, however, with Lee tragically succumbing to his illness.

'Lee likes players from all over the NBC, but there's something about Roy that he liked. I didn't even know he had heard of Roy Hibbert before,' Lee's legal guardian Victor Baker told the Indianapolis Star on Wednesday.

A devoted fan of Hibbert 'since he was back at Georgetown [University],' according to Mr Baker, Lee followed the athlete from 2008 until his final day on Thursday.

Diagnosed with stage four leukaemia in February the boy underwent a bone marrow transplant in June but it didn't take.

When his left lung developed an infection, consequently spreading to his right, doctors thought it would be best not to try again.

'The doctors did a CT scan to see how his lung was doing, but it was getting worse because the infection was spreading more,' Mr Baker said.

'The doctors finally decided they didn't want to put him through another round of chemo because it would pretty much suppress his immune system and they didn't feel like he would be able to handle it.'

Flying in: Roy Hibbert #55 of the Indiana Pacers was scheduled to fly to California to meet with Lee on Friday after hearing what a huge fan the boy was

Keeping promises: Despite hearing the news of Lee's death, Hibbert jumped on a plane on late Thursday afternoon hoping to still meet with the boy's family and friends

Last week Lee was moved to hospice care at the UC Davis Medical Center with family flying in from all around the country to see him.

Hibbert planned to too.

'Once I heard he had a dying wish, I knew I had to do something more than send him presents and Skype with him on the computer,' Hibbert told the Star after announcing his plans.

'I'm usually uncomfortable going to hospitals when the Pacers do events because it's pretty tough to see kids in that situation. Once I heard about (Lee), I realized I had to get over it and do it for him,' he said.

With African-Americans having only a 6 per cent chance of finding a match for a bone marrow transplant - compared to 85-88 per cent for Caucasians, according to the African American Community Health Advisory Committee - Hibbert said while he was visiting Lee he'd provide a swab of his cheek as well.

That swab would tell doctors if he had the potentially life-saving match the boy needed.

'I've had two family members die of cancer,' Hibbert told the Star. 'It's tough. I seriously don't know what I'm going to say to Lee. I'm just going to be myself. If I can get a smile out of him that will be great.'

When the news broke of his death, one day short of their eventful meeting, Hibbert still kept his plans to fly out and see his family.

'On my way to Sacramento,' Hibbert informed his Twitter followers on late Thursday afternoon.

'I'm heartbroken today. I won't be able to meet my lil guy Lee but I will be there for his parents and family.'
