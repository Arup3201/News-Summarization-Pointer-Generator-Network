'Relax: Foreign Secretary William Hague said in an interview that Britain should move on from its past and look to the future

Britain should abandon its 'post-colonial guilt' as the rest of the world does not care about the old empire any more, William Hague said today.

The Foreign Secretary also said most countries will have a positive view of the UK because of the Olympics, adding this can be used to be more ambitious on the international stage.

He added that Britain belongs to a 'networked world' where old grudges against us are dying out.

'I think we should just relax,' he said. 'It’s a long time ago, the retreat from empire.'

Mr Hague went on: 'You know, Hillary Clinton comes on the line to discuss Syria and the first thing she says is, "Congratulations to Britain on the Olympics". And that’s true of every single foreign minister.'

In Africa the older generation will still think of Britain 'in colonial terms', he acknowledged.

'But that is a small minority of the population there. This is a new and equal partnership,' he said.

'It’s a world where networks defeat hierarchies and where the world is not in blocks. It is the networked world and Britain is a natural centre.'

He said Harold MacMillan’s wind of change speech, acknowledging independence movements in Africa, was in 1960 'before I was born'.

'It’s a different generation. Britain is seen in a different light', he said.

'We have to get out of this post-colonial guilt. Be confident in ourselves. The lessons we should take from the admitted need for austerity, saving money, is that we actually need to be more ambitious, not less.'

Positive: Mr Hague said London 2012 had changed the world's view of Britain and this can be used to be more ambitious

As well as his role in the Foreign Office, Mr Hague is also First Secretary of State and one of the most senior members of the Cabinet.

Reports have suggested he could become Tory party chairman or even replace George Osborne as Chancellor in Mr Cameron’s first major reshuffle.

But Mr Hague said: 'I’ve always been clear I came back into frontline politics to do foreign policy and that’s what I’m here doing.

'When I was leader of the party there were always polls showing I was the least popular. Since I took no notice of these things I’ve become more popular. So I propose to go on taking no notice whatsoever.'
