It may be banned for ordinary people in Iran, but Facebook has at least one member in the country.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appears to have become one of the website's newest members.

Despite banning it due to its use by activists to rally government opponents in 2009, a page purporting to be for Khamenei himself launched a few days ago with the name Khamenei.ir.

Ayatollah Khamenei has joined Facebook despite banning the rest of Iran from the site due to government opposition in 2009

The 73-year-old's page displays pictures of him alongside speeches and pronouncements he has made.

While there are several other Facebook pages already devoted to Khamenei, the new one - whose number of 'likes' was today close to 10,000 - appeared to be officially authorised, rather than merely the work of admirers.

The page has been publicised by a Twitter account of the same name that Iran experts believe is run by Khamenei's office.

Both U.S-based social media sites are blocked in Iran by a wide-reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of Iranians who use special software to get around the ban.

In 2009, social media were a vital tool for those Iranians who believed the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged. Facebook was used to help organise street protests of a scale not seen since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

The protests - which the government said were fuelled by Iran's foreign enemies - were eventually stamped out by the security forces and their political figureheads remain under house arrest.

Khamenei's Facebook page has so far shared a picture of a young Khamenei alongside the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the early 1960s.

It shares a similar tone, style and content with accounts devoted to disseminating Khamenei's message on Twitter and Instagram and to the website www.khamenei.ir, a sophisticated official website published in 13 languages.

Experts said the social media accounts showed that Iran, despite restricting access to such sites inside the country, was keen to use them to spread its world view to a global audience.

'Social media gives the regime leadership another medium of communication, one that can share their message with a younger and far more international demographic,' said Afshon Ostovar, a Middle East analyst at CNA, a U.S.-based research organisation.

Iran has yet to comment on whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has joined Facebook or not

Iran is locked in a decade-long dispute with the West over its nuclear programme, which the U.S. and its allies suspect is aimed at developing a bomb, something Iran has repeatedly denied.

Iran, the West and regional states are also often opposed on issues such as the violence raging in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Iranian authorities have said they are trying to build a national intranet, something sceptics say is a way to further control Iranians' access to the global web. Tehran tried to block Google Inc.'s email service this year but soon reopened access.

Iranian authorities had no immediate comment on the site, which apparently went online last week but only recently gained prominence among social media watchers.

Despite the possibility that it is a hoax, the page has generated at least 170 comments - laudatory and derogatory, and nearly all in Farsi - that highlight the deep political divisions in Iran and possibly opposition fervor from expatriate Iranians.

One post compared Khamenei to a celebrated ruler of ancient Persia, Cyrus the Great, who significantly expanded the Persian empire 2,500 years ago.

Another wrote: 'Mr. Khamenei, how are you visiting this page? With proxy?'

It was a reference to Iran's blocking of Facebook and many other Western social media sites, and the efforts to bypass the restrictions using proxy server links from outside Iran.

The U.S. State Department said Monday it will keep tabs on the page, but had no comment on whether it was genuine or not.

Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland joked that Washington is curious how many 'likes' the Khamenei page receives.

But much about the page - including an informal photo of Khamenei riding in a car - suggested it was not sanctioned by Iran's top leader. It is also highly unlikely that Khamenei would endorse a banned outlet such as Facebook.

The Net is not unknown territory for Iranian leaders, however. Khamenei, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others have official websites. Also, some senior Iranian clerics issue religious opinions by email.
