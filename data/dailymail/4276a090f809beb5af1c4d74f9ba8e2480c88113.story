Carrying on: Steve Job's biological father Abdulfattah Jandali was seen holding an iPhone on Monday

He has told of his deep sorrow at his son's death.

And Steve Job's biological father was today seen holding a bit of his son's legacy as he left his Casino holding his iPhone.

Abdulfattah Jandali, who gave his son up for 
adoption and never got to meet him, said he was not shocked by the news of Jobs's death, but desperately wanted to meet him before he passed away.

The sighting of Mr Jandali happened the same day as Mr Jobs' death certificate was released, stating that the Apple founder died due to respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer.

The certificate, released by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, said that Mr Jobs had a 'metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor' and there would not be an autopsy.

The death certificate also states that Mr Jobs had the cancer for eight years before his death, stating that he was first diagnosed in 2004.

Mr Jandali only learned that Mr Jobs was his son one year later in 2005.

Mr Jandali said in the past year he 
wrote a few simple emails to Mr Jobs such as 'Happy birthday' and  'I 
hope your health is improving.'

He received he received two short supplies. The last one came six weeks before Mr Jobs died. It just said 'Thank you.'

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr Jandali said he found out about Mr Jobs's death last Wednesday.

A stranger called his office to offer their condolences.

Mr Jandali said: 'It was not a shock. Basically all you feel is sadness.'

The
 80-year-old works as the general manager of the Boomtown casino outside
 Reno, Nevada, where he has a staff of around 450 workers.

He is said to have a quiet leadership style. 

Devastated: Steve Jobs' father Abdulfattah Jandali looks deep in thought

Steve Jobs looked frail when he was seen with a friend in August

He said: 'I can't take credit for my children's success.'

The estrangement with his two children has caused him much sadness in the last few years.

He
 certainly shares a physical resemblance to the man who co-founded Apple
 Inc. and went on to become one of the world's most famous businessmen.

But for Mr Jandali the only connection with his son is his story of the emails and the iPhone 4 that he owns. 

He
 told the Wall Street Journal: 'I don't know why I emailed. I guess 
because I felt bad when I heard about the health situation. 

'He had his life and I had my life, and we were not in contact.

'If I talked to him, I don't know what I would have said to him.'

He
 said that after hearing of Mr Jobs's death, he watched online videos of
 the Apple chief's famous keynote speeches launching new products.

He also watched Mr Jobs's famous Stanford University in 2005 in which he spoke about his personal life.

While Mr Jobs spoke of his biological mother and sister, he never mentioned Mr Jandali.

MailOnline
 revealed in August that in the months leading up to Steve Jobs's death,
 Mr Jandali became overcome with guilt for abandoning his son.

But he admitted that after all this time he was too proud to make the first move to arrange a meeting.

Mr Jandali, a Syrian immigrant, said he did not call Mr Jobs for fear he would wrongly think he was after his money.

He
 said at the time: 'This might sound strange, though, but I am not 
prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the 
phone to call him.

'Steve will have to do that, as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune.

'Now I just live in hope that, before it is too late, he will reach out to me, because even to have just one coffee with him just once would make me a very happy man'.

Mr Jandali said that it was 56 years ago that his girlfriend Joanne Simpson fell pregnant and he was forbidden from marrying her.

Without telling him she left their home in Wisconsin and went to San Francisco where she had the baby and gave it up for adoption.

Mr Jandali said that even though he thought of himself as a 'computer dunce' he owns a Mac computer, iPhone and an iPad.

He said: 'I honestly look at these things and cannot believe Steve created them. Steve Jobs was a genius.'
