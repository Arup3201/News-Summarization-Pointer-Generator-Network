Film fans have been left tantalising clues about what some scenes in the new Star Wars movie will look like – because the production crew left equipment behind in one of the locations.

Last week cast and crew descended on Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, for a shoot, leading to intense speculation and excitement about how that location would feature in next year’s hotly anticipated blockbuster.

Now, pictures have emerged of pieces of film kit scattered around the beauty spot, the crew having moved out.

Left film kit behind, you have: Plugs and wires left in Puzzlewood, Gloucestershire, by the Star Wars Episode VII film crew litter the forest floor

Excitement: The location of the film equipment has led to speculation about just how the Forest of Dean will feature in the new film 

Nonchalant: Some might wonder why the film crew weren't more careful about what they left behind

Lush: The Forest of Dean is known for its knotty pathways and pristine flowers, plants and trees

Wires, plugs and ramps haphazardly litter parts of the forest floor, with some  wasting no time casting an eye over the scene, eager to try and work out where the actors and actresses might have been filmed.

Due for release in December next year, Star Wars: Episode VII features the stars of the original 1970s trilogy Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher alongside newcomers and unknowns.

It will be set 40 years after the original films in the same fantasy galaxy, and fans have been buzzing with debate about which planet the lush green forest of Puzzlewood might represent.

Clue: Might this clearing be one of the locations in J J Abrams' contribution to the space saga?

Search: Some wasted no time casting an eye over the places where kit had been left, eager to work out where the actors and actresses might have been filmed

Following in their footsteps: Walkers trekked through Puzzlewood shortly after the cast and crew left

Bright idea: Floodlights seen at the edge of the forest, which has been used in several major productions

Atmospheric: The knotted trees and winding paths of Puzzlewood have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis

The production recently made news when Harrison Ford broke his foot during filming. After initially being confined to a wheelchair, he is now walking on crutches

The knotted trees and winding paths of the forest, a popular family tourist attraction, were said to have been the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's enchanted woodlands in Lord of the Rings.

More recently they have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis.

Fans have speculated Puzzlewood could be a return to the lush green territory inhabited by Yoda or the Forest Moon of Endor, inhabited by Ewoks.

Some fans have speculated that the Forest of Dean could be used to represent the Forest Moon of Endor

Ideal: The Forest of Dean is the perfect place to recreate an other-worldly atmosphere

Wood you believe it: The film crew has a lot of tidying up to do after the week-long shoot

The film crew did their best to hide the reason they were at the site when it was first discovered

Sizing things up: The cast and crew occupied a huge area of land in Gloucestershire

For the original Star Wars trilogy, the spectacular redwood forests of northern California were used for the Forest Moon of Endor.

And the frozen landscape of Hoth was represented by the northern wilderness of Norway - which was so cold in real life that some scenes were shot out of the crew's hotel doorway.

Few details about the set have been released, but Kevin Smith - the director of Clerks (1994) and Dogma (1999) - gave a few tantalising details after a recent visit.

In a Q&A session at the Neuchatel International Film Festival in Switzerland, he said: 'It was tactile; it wasn't a series of f****** green and blue screens in which later on digital characters would be added. It was there; it was happening.

'It's like Field of Dreams,' he continued. 'And if [director J.J. Abrams] builds it, we’re all going to come because it's amazing. It looks fantastic.

'I cried, and I hugged that guy.'

Star Wars will be hoping the scene they create at Forest of Dean is better than the last time the legendary films were shot in an English forest.

Whippendell Woods near Watford, Hertfordshire, were used as the meeting point between The Phantom Menace's Jedi knights and Jar Jar Binks - probably the least beloved Star Wars character of all time.
