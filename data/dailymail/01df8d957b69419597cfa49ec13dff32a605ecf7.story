Steve McClaren believes fan pitch invasions during Derby County's match against Nottingham Forest on Sunday was one of the reasons his team could only come away with a point from the East Midlands derby.

Seven fans were arrested during the heated clash as both Rams and Forest fans entered the field of play during the second half.

McClaren felt his side were on top during the second 45 minutes until the break in play halted Derby's progress.

He told the Derby Telegraph: 'It was difficult because we had started the second half well. We were more aggressive. We did not make the most of our opportunities. In the end chaos reigned and we came away with a point.

'I don't know what was happening with the break in play. It was handled poorly. Things seemed to go against us, when it came to decisions and moments. But we stuck in there and that is the character we will need this season.

'The players handled the occasion very well. We are pleased with that.'

The Rams came from a goal behind to secure a point on Sunday after a scrambled Ryan Shotton effort cancelled out Britt Assombalonga's opener.

Both teams paid tribute to former manager Brian Clough as they marked the 10-year anniversary of his passing.

Nottingham Forest boss Stuart Pearce added: 'It was a good atmosphere and fantastic that the fans united for Cloughie in the 10th minute. It was nice to see.

'I think it’s great to see the unity of the fans. If there’s one individual or one person who unites this part of world, it is that man.'
