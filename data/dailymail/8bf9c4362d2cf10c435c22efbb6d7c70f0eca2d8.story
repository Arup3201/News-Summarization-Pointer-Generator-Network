President Barack Obama is challenging major cable and telephone companies to expand broadband access  by encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to pre-empt state laws that stifle competition for high-speed Internet service.

Obama wants to expand access to broadband communications services, siding with local communities that want either to expand competition or provide municipal services themselves. 

To promote it, he used a Cedar Fall, Iowa, speech today to announce that his administration will provide technical and financial assistance to towns and cities that want to improve Internet service for their residents.

'Today high speed broadband is not a luxury. It's a necessity. This isn't just about making it easier to stream Netflix or scroll through your Facebook news feed,' he said. 'This is about helping local businesses grow and prosper and compete in a global economy. 

'It's about giving the entrepreneur, the small business person on main street, chance to compete with the folks out in silicon valley or across the globe.'

President Barack Obama is pictured here departing the White House today for Cedar Falls, Iowa, where he will give a speech this afternoon urging the Federal Communications Commission, an independent regulatory agency, to override state laws that bar competition among broadband providers 

The proposals do not require congressional approval and are part of a series of new measures Obama is rolling out before his State of the Union address next week. 

Obama detailed broadband plans this afternoon in Cedar Falls, a community that has taken steps to provide high-speed Internet to its roughly 40,000 residents. 

Roughly 20 years ago Cedar Falls created a community broadband network. In 2010 it began a two-year process to upgrade to a full fiber network.

'Basically, you guys were like the captain in Jaws...'We're gonna need a bigger boat,' he said, using a variation of the film's famous quote.

The administration's stance will put it at odds with major cable and telephone companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc., that currently provide Internet service, often with little or no competition. 

Obama has already angered the industry by calling for new FCC rules that treat Internet service providers as public utilities.

In a White House video before the announcement, Obama says: 'You know what it feels like when you don't have a good Internet connection. Everything is buffering, you try to download a video and you've got that little circle thing that goes round and round, it's really aggravating.'

But there are also 'real world consequences to this and it makes us less economically competitive,' Obama says, explaining that businesses are more likely to set up shop in towns where broadband Internet is easy to access.

Jeff Zients, director of Obama's National Economic Council, said Obama wants to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press the FCC, an independent regulatory agency, to 'ensure that all states have a playing field that allows for a vibrant and competitive market for communication services.'

Nineteen states place restrictions on municipal broadband networks, many with laws encouraged by cable and telephone companies. Obama referred to the laws today as 'old' and put consumers at the 'whim' of their providers.

Obama estimated that 45 million Americans are unable to purchase next generation broadband Internet that creates connections that he said are six or seven times faster that 'today's basic speeds.'

Advocates of those laws say they are designed to protect taxpayers from municipal projects that are expensive, can fail or may be unnecessary.

The National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures have urged the FCC not to pre-empt state laws on broadband. 

And Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska said the proposal amounts to the federal government attempting 'to wield greater power and control.'

'This afternoon, we will see the president parachute into Iowa and tout a new federal takeover of state laws governing broadband and the Internet,' Fischer said. 'These Washington-centric solutions set a dangerous precedent and have real impacts on local communities and businesses.'

The FCC is already considering requests for Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, to prevent state laws from blocking the expansion of their broadband projects. 

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in June that local communities that want to provide their own broadband service 'shouldn't be stopped by state laws promoted by cable and telephone companies that don't want that competition.'

A new White House report says that while 94 percent of Americans living in urban areas can purchase an Internet connection of 25 megabits per second.

'But that number doesn't look quite as good when you look at the speeds we're gonna need for all the apps and all the videos and data, new software that is constantly coming on the market,' Obama said today. 'We gotta keep pace. We gotta be up to speed.'

The White House says only 51 percent of Americans in rural areas have access to what Obama described as 'super fast' Internet speeds.

According to its report, three out of four Americans lack a choice for such Internet service because of lack of competition.

But many rural Americans also lack access to high-speed Internet because of the costs associated with constructing the infrastructure necessary to transmit broadband.

The White House has announced that the Commerce Department would promote faster broadband connections by hosting regional workshops and offering technical assistance to communities interested in creating their own network. 

The Department of Agriculture will provide grants and loans of $40 million to $50 million to assist them.

A council comprising more than a dozen government agencies will also seek to remove regulatory and policy barriers that hinder broadband competition, the White House said.
