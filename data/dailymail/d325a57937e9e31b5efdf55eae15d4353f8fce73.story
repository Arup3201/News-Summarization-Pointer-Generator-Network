Search: The Paris home of International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde was today searched by anti-corruption police

The home of International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde was raided by anti-corruption police yesterday.

It follows claims that she authorised a £270million payout to a prominent Nicolas Sarkozy supporter when she was French finance minister.

It is not known what officers discovered or seized after entering the £1million Paris apartment of the world’s most senior banker.

The Court of Justice of the Republic, a tribunal qualified to judge the conduct of government ministers while in office, said Mrs Lagarde, 57, may have abused her position to help a controversial businessman.

The case dates back 20 years. Bernard Tapie, former head of Adidas in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by the then state-owned Credit Lyonnais bank when he sold his stake in the sports kit empire in 1993 for around £300million.

Within months the bank sold the company for more than twice that amount, which led to Tapie demanding compensation.

Mrs Lagarde is said to have allowed the equivalent of £270million in compensation to be awarded to Tapie in 2008 when Mr Sarkozy was French president and she was finance minister.

Critics said the settlement was too generous. Mrs Lagarde, whose salary as IMF managing director is £300,000, denies wrongdoing.

Claims: The raid relates to claims Miss Lagarde authorised a £270million payout to Bernard Tapie

Dispute: Mr Tapie, the former head of Adidas in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by Credit Lyonnais bank. miss Lagarde ended the dispute by asking a panel of judges to arbitrate

In 1997 Tapie, an ex-government 
minister, was jailed for match-fixing after owning one of France’s 
biggest football clubs, Olympique de Marseille.

Mrs Lagarde’s lawyer, Yves Repiquet, 
said: ‘This search will help uncover the truth [and will] help to 
exonerate my client from any criminal wrongdoing.’

But news of her home being visited by 
detectives is bound to have serious repercussions for her French 
presidential ambitions and the IMF.

Dominque Strauss-Kahn, another senior 
French politician, was sacked as IMF chief following allegations that he
raped a chambermaid in a New York hotel two years ago.

Mrs Lagarde, who was in Frankfurt at 
the time of the police raid, is believed to be thinking of running in 
the 2017 presidential elections.

An IMF spokesman said its executive 
board had considered the Tapie issue when appointing Miss Lagarde and 
had been confident she would be able to do her job effectively.
