Getting into the holiday spirit, a husband and wife who love to sing and dance have released a Thanksgiving  parody of Meghan Trainor's booty-shaking anthem All About That Bass.

Titled All About That Baste, Penn and Kim Dean Holderness from North Carolina are seen pulling a range of high energy moves around the house - with their children, Lola and Penn Charles, taking on cameo roles.

At one point the camera-loving couple strike batons of butter together in time to the beat and later Mrs Holderness grabs a basting brush, playfully pretending to strike her husband's face.

Novel: At one point the camera-loving couple strike batons of butter together in time to the beat

The turkey baster is a key feature of the video and Mr Holderness wangles it around. 

In one scene he plunges the implement into a pan of sauce and in another he douses the juice over a bird roasting in the oven.

Through the lyrics he reveals that he finds the annual feast quite a nightmare because he tends to 'screw everything up' - burning pies, making dry stuffing and rustling up inedible casseroles. 

The only task he is trusted with is basting the turkey.

“I’m all about that baste, 'bout that baste, more butter,' the family patriarch sings.
