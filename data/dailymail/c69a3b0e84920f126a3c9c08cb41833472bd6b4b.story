Sabrina Rubin Erdely also fell for a dubious testimony from a boy claiming he was sexually abused by priests, it has been claimed

The author behind a Rolling Stone article claiming a University of Virginia student had been gang-raped at a fraternity also fell for a dubious testimony from a boy claiming he was sexually abused by priests, it has been claimed. 

Sabrina Rubin Erdely forced the magazine into an apology after the story published in November based on the account by alleged victim 'Jackie' was found to have a large number of inaccuracies.

Now it has been claimed that she accepted the claims of petty criminal Billy Doe, who claimed he was raped by members of the Philadelphia Archdiocese, testimony which a legal website claims had a series of discrepancies.

According to Big Trial, Doe told his story to the archdiocese, police, and a grand jury, and would subsequently before recounting it to two different juries in separate criminal cases. 

Each time he told his story, the site accused the details of changing.

A grand jury report published in January 2011 was revealed to have 20 inaccuracies, however Erdely's piece ran the following September without addressing the differences.

She also allegedly did not address any credibility issues, ignoring in the piece that Doe had been arrested six times - once with 56 bags of heroin he was planning to sell.

The piece titled 'The Catholic Church's Secret Sex Crime files', describes Billy as a 10-year-old who was raped and 'sodomized' by three men and sometimes made to drink sacramental wine after mass. 

Erdely repeatedly quoted from the secret archive files formerly kept by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in a locked safe. 

The files chronicled the secret history of four decades of sex abuse in the archdiocese involving 169 abuser priests and hundreds of child victims. 

However, the site reported that there is no mention in 45,000 pages  of a predator trusting another predator enough to share a victim.

Doe's story about serving at an early morning weekday Mass was contradicted by extensive calendars  his mother kept, the site says. 

They apparently showed that Billy did not serve as an altar boy during an early morning Mass for the entire 1998-99 school year he was enrolled in fifth grade at St. Jerome's Church.

A court was also told that following the string of attacks, Doe had taken out books about sexual abuse from the school library when in fact the site says it was taken out by a female student. 

According to the site Doe initially detailed rapes, being punched in the head and knocked unconscious, being tied up with altar sashes, being strangled with a seat belt, and threatened with death. He later dropped those claims.

The story concerning the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the University of Virginia prompted the paper into an apology because of a number of inaccuracies in the story 

Three priests and a school teacher were convicted following Billy's story, which Big Trial says has been undermined because of the inaccuracies.

One of the suspects reportedly died while handcuffed to a hospital bed last month. 

On Monday Rolling Stone clarified its apology over the story telling readers the mistakes were the magazine's fault, not the alleged victim's.

That's a shift from the original note to readers, issued Friday, when it said of Jackie, the woman who claimed to have been gang-raped at a Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, 'Our trust in her was misplaced.' The updated note removes that line, which struck some critics as blaming the victim.

The magazine said that it shouldn't have agreed to Jackie's request not to contact the alleged assailants to get their side of the story, out of sensitivity to her. 'These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie,' wrote the magazine's managing editor, Will Dana. 'We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening.' 

The decision not to contact the alleged rapists prompted criticism from other news organizations.
