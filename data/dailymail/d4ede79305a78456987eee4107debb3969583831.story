He has presented Countryfile for 25 years.

But to many, including Prime Minister David Cameron, John Craven will forever be remembered best for his children’s TV roles.

Mr Craven first found fame in the early Seventies when he presented the BBC’s first children’s news programme John Craven’s Newsround.

He was with the show from its inception in 1972, even after it dropped his name until 1989.

His subsequent ubiquity during the 70s and 80s on kids TV- also presenting items on other shows, such as Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and Saturday Superstore – appears to have left an indelible mark.

The 73-year-old Yorkshireman was awarded the OBE in 2000 for services to rural and children’s broadcasting, and the Baird Medal in 2002. In 2011, he accepted a Children’s BAFTA award for Newsround.

He revealed: ‘When I met David Cameron, he came straight up to me and said, ‘I grew up on you.’ I thought, Really? Am I that old?’

And it’s not just the PM, Mr Craven adds: ‘But I also remember being on a plane and a hostess approached me and said, ‘I’d just like to thank you for being part of my childhood.’ ”

In 2009, Mr Craven’s former colleague Miriam O’Reilly, 57, was sacked from Countryfile when the show moved to Sunday evenings on BBC1. It re-launched with younger presenters Julia Bradbury, 43, and Matt Baker, 36.

Miss O’Reilly later sued the BBC for age discrimination and was awarded a £150,000 payout.

Asked whether she was right to sue the corporation, Mr Craven replied: ‘Yes, if she felt that she’d been badly treated then of course she was right to take them on.’

However, he insisted he was right not to get involved in the dispute himself, adding: ‘It got very unpleasant and for the team it was an unhappy time.

‘I didn’t get involved because I’m not management, I’m just a hired hand. When you’re in the front line as a presenter, the easiest thing for a new manager to do when they come in is get rid of you and bring in a new face and that’s always been the case.

‘I’m incredibly lucky because I’ve survived about 12 different series producers on Countryfile.’

Mr Craven, who lives in a small village in Oxfordshire, said he thinks of himself as a ‘country person’, but said: ‘I know I’ll never be fully accepted. But I like to think, as we try to prove on the show, that there’s room for everyone in the countryside.’

Praise: He praised the countryside show for its dedication to promoting rural affairs in a balanced way

Praising Countryfile for its balanced approach to reporting rural affairs, he added: ‘There was an idea that you weren’t a true country person unless you believed in hunting. I don’t believe that to be true. I think there are a lot of country people who don’t agree with hunting.’

In a wide-ranging interview with the Radio Times, Mr Craven also warns a  growing appetite for Western food in Asian countries could create a shortage in this country.

The 73-year-old presenter said people in India and China increasingly like to eat the same foodstuffs as us, meaning we may find it hard to import what we need.

And he urged the UK to produce more of its own food instead of buying it from abroad.

He said: ‘Food security is incredibly important now. We produce about 60 per cent of our own food; we need to produce much more because the Asian countries, India and China especially, are wanting our kind of food now, particularly wheat and all the basics.

‘And whoever has the most money will get what they want.’
