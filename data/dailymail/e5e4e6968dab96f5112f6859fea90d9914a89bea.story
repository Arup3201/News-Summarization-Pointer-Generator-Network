Nuisance: Gemma Fairhurst, pictured, brought misery to Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, with her anti-social behaviour

A teenage ladette who brough missery to an entire town has been hit with an ASBO - sparking a major dip in crime.

Gemma Fairhurst, 18, tormented residents of Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, with a reign of terror which included threatening a pregnant social worker at a youth club and mocking a group of disabled youngsters with special needs.

Police blamed her for being behind much of the trouble in the market town which also included locals pubs being pelted with stones.

Last year Fairhurst was ordered to sign an 'acceptable behaviour contract' - a police tool to get her to behave - after being referred to Bolton Council.

But despite a further series of warning letters she continued to ignore the terms and has now been given an ASBO.

The ASBO bans her entering from Connexions and Zac's Youth Bar in the town plus the Welcome Inn and Saddle pubs.

She also faces up to five years jail if she breaches the ASBO by behaving in a manner likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

Fairhust also cannot be in company with another unnamed young woman in a public place and failing to leave any premises, having been directed to leave by a member of staff.

Today Greater Manchester Police said since she was ordered to comply with the ASBO, the number of anti-social behaviour incidents in Farnworth town centre and market have dropped.

Sgt Jon Seeds said: ‘Gemma was provided with one-to-one support by a local youth leader. However, her behaviour was a rollercoaster of disruption and compliance.

‘Unfortunately she was at the centre of many of the incidents that we have seen in Farnworth and, as a result, an ASBO was obtained.

‘Farnworth town centre and market have seen a reduction in incidents and work continues with increased patrols over the half-term period and additional youth provision.

‘Any youths who are intent on causing anti-social behaviour in Farnworth will be brought to account. While perception of young people in Farnworth plays an emotive part in reports we receive, it is hoped, through high visibility of the police and direct action, we can reassure residents we will not tolerate poor behaviour from our young people.’

Result: Since issuing Fairhurst with an ASBO, police say they have seen a significant drop in crime in her hometown of Farnworth, pictured, near Bolton, Greater Manchester

Councillor Derek Burrows, Cabinet Member for Police and Community Safety at Bolton Council, said: ‘We work very closely with the police to prevent and tackle antisocial behaviour.

‘We will always try to work with individuals to prevent them repeating behaviour and wherever possible, go through a number of stages, including Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, but as a last resort, we will take them to court.

‘We hope that this demonstrates to others that we will continue to crack down on this type of behaviour.’

Zacs Youth Bar refused to comment.
