Looking pale but alert, this is little Ashya King yesterday after his first day of long-awaited cancer therapy.

The five-year-old brain tumour patient, whose parents fought to secure proton beam treatment for him, underwent the first of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in Prague.

The session followed a week of tests after Ashya was flown to the Czech capital from Spain by private jet.

Hope: Ashya King after the first proton beam treatment on his brain tumor at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, Czech Republic

Concern: Naghmeh King waits by an ambulance as Ashya is transported to the Proton Therapy Centre yesterday

His parents Brett and Nagmeh King sparked a controversial international manhunt after they removed their son from Southampton General Hospital without doctors' permission in a bid to take him abroad for the specialist treatment, which is not available on the NHS.

The Proton Therapy Centre in Prague released a schedule for the first day of Ashya's treatment for a brain tumour, which saw him leave the University Hospital Motol this morning to undergo irradiation.

His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: 'There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has - and there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.' 

Mr and Mrs King faced a legal battle to get their child to Prague after removing Ashya from hospital on August 28, with a High Court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain.

Ashya now faces 30 visits to the Proton Therapy Centre, with the first 13 focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was. 

Optimistic: Ashya King is transported to the Proton Therapy Centre to start his proton treatment yesterday morning. Czech doctors saying 70-80 per cent of patients in Ashya's condition survive

In a statement on its website, the Proton Therapy Centre outlined the difference between proton beam therapy and conventional radiotherapy.

It said: 'Proton therapy can be much better modulated and precisely focused into the tumour volume. In case of irradiation of medulloblastoma in Ashya, it is necessary to apply the highest possible dose into the former location but protect the tissue around as much as possible.

'In Ashya's case, those are vital structures of the heart, lung, liver and intestines.'

Proton therapy would decrease the dose to other parts of the body, including the heart, liver and intestines and trachea by up to 80 per cent, the PTC said.

'This means decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders, breathing disorders or metabolic disorders on the first place and better protection of the swallowing functions and normal food intake,' the statement continued.

Upset: Brett King and his wife Naghemeh were allegedlly warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities

According to the PTC's website, Dr Ondrova specialises in cancer in children and is a member of the Czech Society for Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics.

Last week, Ashya's father claimed British authorities threatened to remove his son for 11 years after he challenged doctors over his treatment.

British doctors opposed the plan to take Asha to the Prague clinic, saying it was not suitable for his condition, but the family disagreed and sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from hospital without permission and took him to Spain.

Mr King said: 'They said to me if I question anything and ask questions as a father…they would take my son away from me, not just for the treatment but until he was 16... I wouldn't be able to see my son for 11 years.'

'I said to my wife this is something so serious that our son could be taken away until he is 16...11 years without us, he wouldn't know his parents, his brothers, his sisters or anyone,' he added.

'We knew we couldn't let that happen... We couldn't question them any more. We couldn't let them know our feelings because one mistake on our side and they'd take him away,' he went on to say. 

Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe

Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of doctors late last month and took him to Southern Spain where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment.

University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the King family was threatened.

After being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a Spanish jail for three nights.

They were released following a public outcry and reunited with Ashya who had been removed and put into a hospital in Malaga.

Ashya previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 July and a further operation on his brain on 22 August.

The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology.

Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas.

The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim.

A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.
