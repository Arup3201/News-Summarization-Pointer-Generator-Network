With a career spanning four decades of catwalk shows and ad campaigns 49-year-old supermodel Yasmin Le Bon is showing no sign of slowing down.

This is the British beauty's third season as the face of high street brand Monsoon and she exudes confidence in the exotic images shot on location in Sri Lanka.

But even supermodels have their insecurities, and in an interview with new fashion magazine Clique to accompany the pictures the rock star wife admitted:'I remember hearing somebody say in an interview that you start to become invisible the older you get, and I’m beginning to understand what they’re saying,'

Yasmin Le Bon is the face of Monsoon for a third season

'I’m not secure about the way I look any more, but I think that’s something I have to grow up about and deal with.

'At my age you have really good days for absolutely no reason and really horrendous days, againfor no known reason,’

In the new pictures the 49-year-old is seen modelling key pieces from the brand's SS14 collection

Yasmin is yet to succumb to the surgeon's
 knife and says she doesn't have a particularly strict beauty routine, 
currently using L’Occitane Immortelle Divine Cream and Elemis 
Pro-Collagen Marine Cream.

pretty island.

It's hard to believe the rock star wife gets insecure, but she confesses: 'I remember hearing somebody say in an interview that you start to become invisible the older you get, and I'm beginning to understand what they're saying.'

The mother-of-three adds: 'I'm not secure about the way I look any more, but I think that's something I have to grow up about and deal with.'

She is 
modelling key pieces from the brand's SS14 collection including beaded 
jackets, loose linen blouses and sequined, scalloped evening dresses.

Off duty the mother-of-three confessses 
that these days she's more likely to be wearing her daughters’ cast-offs
 than the other way around.

Her
 current favourite piece is a Christopher Kane leather mini skirt, 
although she points out it's 'not too mini, if it was too mini, I 
wouldn’t be wearing it.'
