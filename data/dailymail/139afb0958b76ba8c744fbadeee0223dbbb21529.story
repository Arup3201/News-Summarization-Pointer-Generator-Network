He insists it would never cross his mind to use his wife to boost his own popularity.

So it must have been someone else’s idea for Miriam Clegg to pose for a glamorous fashion shoot to accompany a cosy interview she and husband Nick gave to a glossy magazine.

The couple shared how they first met and fell in love, with the Deputy Prime Minister apparently becoming quite tearful as he told the tale. 

Details about their home life and marriage also emerged in their first joint interview.

He insists it would never cross his mind to use his wife to boost his own popularity.So it must have been someone else’s idea for Miriam Clegg to pose for a glamorous fashion shoot to accompany a cosy interview she and husband Nick gave to a glossy magazine

But despite using the occasion to show off his wife and talk about their relationship, the Lib Dem leader told Red magazine he would never try to use her for publicity.

‘We’re husband and wife,’ he said. ‘I don’t think of Miriam as some sort of PR seesaw. It would literally never occur to me.’

According to the magazine, Mr Clegg welled up as he told how he fell in love at first sight when he and Miriam were students in Bruges.

‘It was total thunderbolt stuff,’ he said before Spanish-born Mrs Clegg, a successful lawyer who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez professionally, interrupted to say: ‘Oh no, this is going to get embarrassing.’ 

Mr Clegg went on: ‘(Miriam was wearing) this dark green velvet thing. And you had what I thought were these quite funny sort of brogue-y shoes on. And I was this pimply Brit, trying to impress her…’

He explained that at first their language of love was pidgin French, as he didn’t speak Spanish and her English was ‘not very strong’.

When asked what attracted them to each other, Mrs Clegg claimed the interview had become ‘too embarrassing’. 

But Mr Clegg continued: ‘Everything that is obvious about Miriam – intelligence, humour, beauty, the lot.’

She said: ‘I just couldn’t believe that he liked me.’

The couple, who have three sons and recently celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary by seeing Verdi’s Rigoletto at the Royal Opera House, told how they have stayed together.

Mrs Clegg said: ‘I think the secret is laughing a lot and having big arguments. If you can get over that before you go to bed, that’s fine.’

Asked who is more even-tempered, Mr Clegg hesitated then pointed at himself and said: ‘Miriam is truly Spanish.’

It has previously emerged that the couple share the housework, although Mrs Clegg has said she has banned her husband from the kitchen on ‘health and safety grounds’.

When that came up again in this interview, Mr Clegg said: ‘Did you say that?’ She laughed and said: ‘I said it in a Spanish magazine. I hoped you hadn’t read that.’

Mrs Clegg said she is flattered by the attention she has received since being in the public eye.

‘I’m 46, so I am not in a position to reject any compliments,’ she said.

‘I have days when I think I look good and days I look terrible. And in both cases it’s me.’ She claimed she does not spend a fortune on clothes and shops a lot online and on eBay.

During the 2010 election, Mrs Clegg spent less time on the campaign trail than either Sarah Brown or Samantha Cameron but has since appeared with her husband, including a trip to a school.

At party conferences, however, she has shown her independence by shunning the convention of a leader’s wife embracing her husband on stage after his speech.
