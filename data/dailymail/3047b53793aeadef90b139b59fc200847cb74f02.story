There were reasons beyond the 211 runs he scored in South Africa last month that convinced Jonathan Trott he was back.

There was his success in batting all day in the blistering heat during that unbeaten innings in Paarl. And the fact he was unfazed by the short ball that was seen as his Achilles heel after his sudden exit from the last Ashes tour.

But, more important to Trott and the reason why he now hopes to return to the England side as an opening batsman alongside Alastair Cook, was how he felt in himself.

He was so calm and composed; a result, in his words, of being a ‘more rounded person’ than ever before. ‘On and off the pitch,’ he says.

This feeling of contentment, this renewed confidence, is something that has come from working through the anxiety issues he endured before he started working with Dr Steve Peters last year. And on Friday, after a brilliant tour of South Africa as captain of the England Lions, Trott thinks he can return to his very best.

That would be something when it was only in 2011 that he was named ICC Cricketer of the Year. But the 33-year-old is oozing positivity and enjoying cricket in a way that was not always possible in the past.

‘I already felt I was well on the way back when I was playing for Warwickshire in the summer,’ he says. ‘But when I batted a whole day in Paarl, where it was probably 42 degrees in the middle, it felt like a good achievement.

‘It was a good checkpoint for myself, and the selectors and coaches. And I was pleased because that’s what you train for. To be able to do that was very satisfying.’

Trott returned home soon after that first Ashes Test in Brisbane due to his anxiety issues 

It was satisfying because it was proof that he was right to back himself when so many feared he would never return to first-class cricket — when even he feared his career might be over when he took a second break away from the game last year. ‘I’m pleased that the hard work has paid off, because I had to work hard to get back,’ Trott adds. 

‘South Africa has shown that my belief is not unfounded; that I can still do well, wherever it is in the order for the full England side.’

Before he left that Ashes tour he was secure batting at No 3. Now, however, the slot alongside Cook is where he might be required when England head to the West Indies next month.

‘I played at No 5 in my first Test and was happy there, but was then moved to No 3,’ he says. ‘I’ve always been happy to do what I am asked to do, and I’d be more than happy to open.

‘I’d love to play in the Tests and one-dayers in the West Indies.

‘It’s the next step for me. My thought process when I was playing second-team cricket at Warwickshire was the need to earn a place in the first team. Now I’m back on the Lions team and my focus has been to try to earn a place in the England team. I’m not saying I’ve done that, but I’ve put a pretty good case forward.

‘I feel good. I’m clear in my head, if I get the chance to play for England again, how I’d play and how I’d approach it. I think I’d be right back to my best, because I feel a more rounded person than when I played for England before.

‘On and off the field I’m a better person, in the way I handle stuff.’

Trott handled all aspects of the Lions tour well. From captaincy to the challenges he faced.

‘I really enjoyed it,’ he says. ‘Captaining was a new challenge, which was nice. It was important I threw myself into the tour.

‘The Lions is a window of opportunity for players to get into the full England side and be ready for Test cricket. It was important I treated it like a full Test tour because it was exactly what I needed. They offered me the captaincy but they also asked me if I’d prefer to concentrate on my batting on my first tour back.

‘But it had already dawned on me that I might be asked when I looked at the squad and the ages of the players, so I’d thought about it already. And I told them I really wanted to do it, even if I did have more in common with the coaches than some of the lads I was playing with. I was the oldest guy there by quite a few years!

‘But it was good. And it was nice seeing these young guys; all so excited about their careers, some of them making the kind of mistakes I used to make.

‘But these guys are 23 and a lot further down the line than I was at their age. The future’s looking bright for England.’

His work with Peters has enabled Trott to employ a new approach to his batting. ‘They tried the short ball in South Africa,’ he says. ‘I was expecting it and I actually don’t mind it. As a batsman it gives you the opportunity to get your eye in because they’re not really trying to get you out.

‘It also makes the ball a lot softer when they are banging it into the wicket, so it can work for me in a couple of ways.

‘But it was an opportunity to work on my all-round game. And recognise the fact that this is where I’d get stuck in the past, trying to attack people’s perceptions of me, trying to please everybody, rather than simply playing to my strengths.

‘I’d try and play all over the wicket when most players don’t.

‘Most players focus on the areas where they are strongest. That is what makes them successful.

‘It’s about sticking to your gameplan. A footballer who can’t dribble doesn’t try to run with the ball through the opposition. He sticks to his strengths. It was not doing that where I came up short in the past, and where I’m now better.’

So what about The Ashes this summer? ‘I’ve not been selected for the next tour yet,’ he says. ‘But I can only take it one series at a time. If I get selected for the West Indies, then great. If I don’t, then I’ll keep working. But I’m a good team man.’

Trott is back in Australia now, working in the media at the Cricket World Cup. ‘I just want to see if I like it and if I’m any good at it,’ he says. He thinks it might be something for the future. But not until he’s done playing the game he has grown to love again.
