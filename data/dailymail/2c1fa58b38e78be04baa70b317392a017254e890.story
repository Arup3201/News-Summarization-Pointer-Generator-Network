Disguise: Alex Abou-El-Ella, who donned full Islamic dress to undertake a daring mission to snatch her daughter Mona back from the child's father in Egypt

A desperate mother dressed head-to-toe in Islamic dress and hid her face behind a veil to carry out a daring mission to snatch her daughter back from the child's Egyptian father.

Alex Abou-El-Ella, 29, of Slough, Berkshire, risked everything to rescue her daughter Mona, three, two years after her husband spirited the girl out of Britain and took her to his home country.

She ignored Foreign Office warnings not to travel to the country, which is gripped by civil unrest, tracked down the child and disguised herself as a local to carry out the audacious rescue.

Her success was in large part thanks 
to the help of British author Donya Al-Nahi, who has been nicknamed Jane
Bond for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children 
snatched by Arab fathers.

Mrs
Abou-El-Ella, who is still married to Mona's father, Mustafa, told the 
Sunday People of the dramatic moment she snatched back her daughter in 
the Nile Delta city of Kafr el-Dawwar.

With
the help of Scot-born Mrs Al-Nahi she had tracked down the nursery 
where Mona was enrolled and the block of flats where she was living with
her father's family.

The 
pair, who had enlisted a trusted driver, sat staking out the block early
in the morning until Mona appeared with an aunt and a boy just before 
9am.

That's when the desperate mother 
seized her moment. Moving awkwardly in the unfamiliar Islamic dress in 
which she had disguised her self, she got out of the car and followed 
them.

'I was walking behind 
them, faster and faster, and saw Mona's hand a few metres away from me,'
she said. 'So I grabbed her, pulled her into my arms and the lady 
looked at my face - but all she could see were my eyes.'

Embracing her child tightly, she turned and fled as the other woman began to scream.

Stumbling in the flowing black material of the burka, she had only seconds to bundle the astonished child into the back seat of her car - but was horrified to find the door was locked.

'I was panicking but Donya managed to open it and pull Mona in,' she said. She managed to leap in as well before the woman who she had just snatched Mona from caught up with them and they drove away.

It was then that the confused toddler - who had been away for some two years - cried out for help from the woman she knew as mummy, to Mrs Abou-El-Ella's dismay.

'I felt shocked and upset to hear those words coming out of her mouth about another woman,' she said. 'But after half an hour she looked up at me and said, "Are you my mum?"'

Reunited: Alex and Mona back in Slough. It is just 12 days since the pair arrived back in the UK after the rescue

Lots to catch up on: Mona, three, had not seen her mother for two years when she came to rescue her, and didn't recognise her, leading her to call for help from the women she had come to know as her parent

The next challenge was smuggling Mona back out of Egypt without alerting the country's authorities. Mrs Abou-El-Ella, who was born in Poland but came to Britain as a teenager, used the Polish passport belonging to her older daughter to conceal Mona's Egyptian surname and bribed an official to allow her to board a London-bound flight.

The subterfuge worked, and they arrived back at Heathrow ten days ago, using Mona's genuine passport to re-enter the UK legally.

Mrs Abou-El-Ella has since contacted her husband to tell him that she has their child.

Brushing up on her English: After Mona was taken Alex could only speak with her by phone with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot English and began speaking more and more in Arabic

Together again: Alex with Mona and her eldest daughter Olivia, six, whose passport she used to smuggle the toddler out of Egypt without raising suspicions from border authorities in Cairo

She met Mustafa when he was running a food stall in Slough, shortly after splitting from her former long-term partner and father of her eldest daughter Olivia, six.

They moved in together and wed in September 2009, three months before Mona was born, with the former Catholic converting to Islam, although she never practised the religion.

Mona was just a year old when Mustafa whisked her off to Egypt, giving his wife no warning of his intentions. He had simply told her he was taking the girl to visit friends.

Instead he had travelled straight to Heathrow airport, bought a ticket and boarded an EgytpAir flight. Mrs Abou-El-Ella still has questions about how he was able to get the Mona through passport control without her own passport.

Invaluable help: Alex with Donya Al-Nahi, who has been nicknamed Jane Bond for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children snatched by Arab fathers

Over the following two years, she had on-off contact with her daughter by phone - with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot English and began speaking more and more in Arabic.

And her husband would periodically threaten to cut off contact altogether, she said. Police told her she could do nothing since the UK has no extradition treaty with Egypt.

It was only after a woman heard of her plight and contacted her to tip her off about Donya Al-Nahi, who has helped a string of mothers reunite with children snatched by Middle Eastern fathers, that she was given hope.

Mrs Al-Nahi said: 'You only have one mother and no-one has the right to take you away from your mum. But Alex was the real hero here. She took the girl.'
