As TV and film royalty met members of the real royal family at Buckingham Palace this evening, the Duchess of Cambridge ensured she stood out at the star-studded event in a vibrant red Alexander McQueen dress.

Kate, 32, has worn the designer pleated skirt dress on previous occasions, most famously on the royal barge 
during the Diamond Jubilee river pageant of 2012.

On that day she accessorised with her trusty LK 
Bennett nude heels and a Lock & Co hat. For today's event, hosted by the Queen to celebrate the dramatic arts, she went for a less formal look.

She ditched the hat to let her glossy
 brown locks fall around her shoulders and substituted a patriotic 
tartan clutch she carried for the Jubliee event for a plainer black 
purse and matching black heels. She added an additional new touch to her look with long, gold earrings.

Re-worked look: Kate accessorised her red dress from Alexander McQueen's spring/summer 2011 collection with a black clutch and heels

Glamorous: She also ditched the hat to let her glossy brown locks fall around her shoulders and wore long gold earrings

The red dress has 
been worn by a number of celebrities since it made its debut on the 
spring/summer 
2011 catwalk back in February 2010.

The former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos wore a sleeveless version of it for the reality show's auditions in July 2011. She
 wore the piece, with its flattering pleated skirt and neat peplum, with
 minimal accessories - just black stilettos and a slick of red lipstick 
finished off the look for Tulisa.

Reality
 TV queen Kim Kardashian has also been pictured in the dress when out in
 New York, adding some bling with a jeweled necklace and metallic 
clutch.

But thankfully none of the
 Hollywood stars and the giants of British film and theatre who joined 
the Duchess of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace this evening made the 
fashion faux pas of wearing the same outfit as style queen Kate.

Meeting Kate: On Sunday night, Prince William described Dame Helen as 'an extremely talented British actress who I should probably call granny'

Laughing: Dame Helen told a giggling Kate 'Your husband called me granny last night' - to which she replied: 'I know'. Above, the pair share a joke as Sir David looks on

The Duchess was introduced to many of the 250 stars present on the night, which celebrated the Queen's 60 years as patron of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art

Actresses
 Uma Thurman, Joely Richardson, Joan Collins, Gemma Arterton and Dame 
Angela Lansbury were all present at the glittering Buckingham Palace 
reception, as well as Sir Roger Moore, Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes.

Elegant
 Dame Helen Mirren, whose uncanny portrayal of the monarch over the 
years even prompted Prince William to joke on Sunday that he should call
 her granny, was also in attendance.

The
 award-winning actress was introduced to the Queen personally, although 
it is not known whether the pair discussed Dame Helen's regal role.

The
 Duchess was also introduced to many of the 250 stars present on a night
 celebrating the Queen's 60 years as patron of the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art and the wider contribution that the dramatic arts make to 
national life.

Inside 
the White Drawing Room, the Queen greeted a line-up of ten hand-picked 
celebrities, including Alan Rickman, Sir David Attenborough - 
representing his brother Richard, Lord Attenborough who was too ill to 
attend - Miss Marple star Dame Angela Lansbury, actress Jane Horrocks, 
British film director of 12 Years A Slave Steve McQueen.

Also present was comedian Lenny Henry, who made a joke about Helen Mirren's film performance as the Queen.

Pointing to the 87-year-old monarch and joking with McQueen, he said: 'This is Helen Mirren. She's brilliant.'

After
 meeting and greeting their guests, the Queen and Kate, who were also 
joined by Prince Michael of Kent, were treated to a 12 minute 
performance which included excerpts from Pygmallion and Oh What a Lovely
 War
