Almost half of holidaymakers row in the car over directions, a survey suggests.

Researchers found that the younger the couple the more likely they are to have an argument because traditional map-reading skills are in decline.

Fifty-six per cent of couples say they squabble on holidays – with 39 per cent admitting to fighting over driving instructions.

Fed up on holiday? You're not alone - almost half of couples have argued over directions on a foreign jaunt

It was worse for younger holidaymakers, with those in their 20s almost twice as likely to have a 'where are we?' row as those in their 60s (38 per cent compared to 21 per cent). 

The next biggest topic for an argument was disagreements over money (18 per cent) or the stress of deciding where to eat or drink (14 per cent). 

The survey was commissioned by comparison site TravelSupermarket promoting map-reading skills with Ordnance Survey.

Bob Atkinson, of TravelSupermarket, said: ‘Exploring a country should be fun, whether you’re finding your way around a city or hitting the open road in a hire car.

‘It’s disappointing a key element of this, map reading, is the major cause of relationship strains on our holidays. With such a large number of couples are falling out with loved ones while away, we want to promote the skills of map reading and in raising this issue we are going to do just that.’

The survey also found that 55 per cent of men think they are better at map reading than women.

Men are also three times more likely to boast that they split up with a partner after a map-reading related argument than women. 

The study, by Opinium Research, was carried out last month and involved 2,003 adults. 

Couples are still using traditional paper maps (41 per cent) to find routes ahead of sat-navs (33 per cent) or mapping iPhone apps (17 per cent) due to the high cost of data roaming fees.
