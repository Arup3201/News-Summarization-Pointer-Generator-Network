The astonishing power enjoyed by the Chinese politician's wife in the frame for murdering British expat Neil Heywood emerged today.

Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in the murky case which has seen Prime Minister David Cameron demand answers, is said to have terrified those around her and behaved like 'an empress'.

Her husband Bo Xilai, 60, rose up the ranks of the Communist Party with an incredibly successful anti-corruption, sweeping gangs from the streets and reducing levels of crime.

But his wife, 50, was an equally strong figure as details of a confrontation at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel - where Heywood, 41, was poisoned last November - would appear to confirm.

Gu, furious when a waiter's pleas to noisy diners to quieten down went unheeded, called the local police chief, Wang Lijun, a close ally of her husband, and summoned him into action.

A source close to Chongqing officials explained how, minutes later, he stormed into the restaurant at the hilltop hotel, brandishing his pistol and threatening the rowdy eaters.

Officers have now begun analysing 
hours of CCTV footage taken from the hotel - said to be a favoured 
location for Gu to hold secret business meetings - for clues.

The new revelations come amid claims Gu is suffering from bone cancer and has only a short time to live, according to the Hong Kong Standard.

Sources claim her terminal diagnosis 
provoked a transformation of her personality leading to her be accused 
of ‘promiscuity’ and flirting around.

This is the latest claim to call into question her character.

A close friend to Heywood said he 
privately confessed that Gu Kailai was ‘mentally unstable’ and behaved 
like an unforgiving ‘empress’.

In conversations three years before his death, Heywood admitted that her behaviour had grown increasingly erratic.

Private: Mr Heywood's body was found at the three-star resort - the same hotel where Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in his murder is said to have shown her power by getting the local police chief to subdue rowdy diners

He told one friend that she was 
comporting herself ‘like an old-fashioned Chinese aristocrat or 
empress,’ according to the Guardian.

She is one of the 39 people have now been arrested in a series of raids over several months on officials linked to 
politician Bo – once tipped as a future Communist Party leader.

Those arrested are believed to include billionaire Xu Ming, one of China’s richest men.

Police believe he was poisoned after he threatened to expose a plan by Gu to move millions of dollars abroad.

Of the various unproven claims to have emerged in the case, it has been suggested that Heywood was helping to launder that money - and even that he was having an affair with Gu.

Gu and Wang are in custody and Bo has not been seen in public since March, when he was dismissed as boss of Chongqing.

Even by the standards of Chinese police, Wang was known as an aggressive officer. He built his reputation in the northeast province of Liaoning, where Bo was governor in the early 2000s.   

Wang, 52, is an ethnic Mongolian. His father was a railway worker and his mother a textile worker. He boxed as a teen, served in the People's Liberation Army for three years and worked as a forestry official before becoming a policeman in 1984.           

His crime crackdown in the northeast town of Tieling won him national acclaim. Zhou Lijun, a screenwriter, spent 10 days with Wang in Tieling in 1996 while working on a screenplay for a TV series about his exploits called ‘Iron Blooded Police Spirits’.    

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy

According to Zhou's account in a 
Chinese newspaper, Wang had a flair for the dramatic. He would drive to 
crime scenes in a Mitsubishi jeep modified to carry a double rack of 
lights on its roof so the locals would know ‘Chief Wang’ was on the 
case.  

He would leap atop the car, draw his 
gun and fire shots in the air after arriving on the scene. On a night 
raid of hair salons thought to be fronts for prostitution, Wang rushed 
into one and threw a young man with dyed yellow hair to the ground.

After a police search for evidence 
yielded nothing, he told them to take the youth to the police station, 
saying, ‘A man with hair like that can't be any good.’        

Bo brought in Wang to lead a crackdown
on organised crime in Chongqing after he became the city's Communist 
Party chief in 2007. The two men became close, said a source in 
Chongqing with access to city officials.      

‘The anti-organised crime campaign was
like a two-man skit,’ said the source. ‘But then they made the 
anti-crime campaign so complicated and turned it into a campaign, a 
movement, that was politicised and expanded, and then there were so many
erroneous cases and cases of torture,’ the source said.    

Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil Heywood was found dead, apparently poisoned after threatening to expose the corrupt dealings of the wife of Communist Party chief Bo Xilai

Since the downfall of Bo and Wang, 
several people who were targets of that campaign have come forward with 
stories of intimidation, torture and forced confession.       

Tales of yet more eccentricities emerged.        

Wang would turn up at police stations 
deep in the night to catch officers sleeping, bawl them out and then 
storm out, said a Chinese businessman who met Wang several times at city
functions. He also demanded continuous supplies of fresh flowers and 
towels, said another source with access to city officials.   

A former colleague of Wang's in 
northeast China said he would sometimes perform the autopsies on 
executed convicts himself because he claimed he wanted to see if ‘their 
hearts were black or red’.       

As Wang's crime crackdown grew, the campaign created enemies in the rank and file, as well as in leadership circles.    

Wang's dragnet led to the city's 
former justice chief and deputy police chief, Wen Qiang, being executed 
in 2010 for protecting gangs, accepting bribes, rape and property scams.
Wang also jailed dozens of policemen and defence lawyers in the name of
cracking down on organised crime.  

State media said he wore a bullet-proof vest after gangs put out a hit order on him.              

More threatening was scrutiny from on 
high. Central government anti-graft investigators in 2011 began looking 
into accusations he accepted bribes from and promoted a subordinate when
he was police chief of Tieling from 2000 to 2003, several sources said.
Wang became anxious and sought help. 

According to accounts previously 
reported by Reuters, Wang feared that Bo, keen to preserve his chances 
for promotion, would abandon him after authorities began probing Wang's 
past.

Wang was extensively involved in 
bugging and surveillance using sophisticated equipment acquired as part 
of Chongqing's campaign against organised crime, and also used those 
capabilities to monitor Bo and those around him, said a source in 
Beijing with close ties to officials. The official allegations against 
Bo, Gu and Wang have not mentioned any bugging 
accusations.               

Late last year, problems with the 
Heywood case surfaced. Wang learnt that some of his officers were 
refusing to sign off on the police report, which said he had died of 
natural causes.
