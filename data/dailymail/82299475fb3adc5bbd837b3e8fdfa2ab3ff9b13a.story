The Beverly Hills Hotel has been handed a lifeline by actor Russell Crowe, after he announced that he didn't support the Hollywood boycott that has crippled business.

The star wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers  his 'friends'.

Once known as the place 'to be seen', the hotel has been almost empty in recent weeks after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced Sharia law in his country, which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death.

Dissension: Russell Crowe said he did not agree with the hotel boycott

A growing group of stars, from Ellen DeGeneres to Sharon Osbourne and Stephen Fry - and even Kim Kardashian - have boycotted the Dorchester Collection in protest at the law.

While Fry cancelled his visit to Coworth Park, near Ascot, which is owned by the group along with The Dorchester and 45 Park Lane in London as well as luxury hotels in Paris, Geneva, Milan and Rome, others have said they will avoid all the hotels in the chain.

A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel

Hollywood stars have in turn focused on The Beverly Hills Hotel, the revered 102-year-old retreat that is loved by the rich and famous.

But Gladiator star Crowe tweeeted his support for workers on Monday, saying: 'I don't agree with the boycotting of Dorchester Collection hotels. It only hurts the hard working staff who I consider friends.'

His message was greet with support on Twitter, with 102 people rewteeted the comment and 274 'favouriting' the tweet.

However, not everyone agreed with the star. Scott Holleran ‏tweeted: 'Maybe you should watch Gladiator again for a refresher in what it truly means to persecute innocent people.'

Kevin Kane added:
 'I am married to a gay Bruniean. Giving money to the Sultan is support.
 Boycott leads to media interest and political pressure.'

Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week

Reality star Kim Kardashian is said to have cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel, while the Motion Picture & Television Fund said it will no longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel.

The Fund said it was making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and abortions, with flogging and stoning.

‘We cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's directors said in a statement.

Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected

Prominent figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it opened its doors in 1912.

Divisive: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's new anti-gay laws have sparked outrage

Branson tweeted that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester Collection property – the hotel group which includes the Beverly Hills Hotel, and is owned by Brunei – ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’

Mavis Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay Leno, said the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no place in civilised society.’

In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws.

Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’

Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery.

The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years.

Response: Comedian Ellen Degeneres and entrepreneur Richard Branson have been vocal in their opposition

The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected.

‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds,' Christopher Cowdray said in a statement.

The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history.

Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.
