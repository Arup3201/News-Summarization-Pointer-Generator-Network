If you thought summer camp was just for kids then think again, as a growing number of travel companies are catering to adult thrill-seekers.

Jackie Roberts, 58, a regular attendee of the Women's Outdoor Retreat in Columbia, South Carolina, said that she enjoys having the opportunity to let her hair down and forget her 'safe, sheltered' life.

The retired telephone technician, who indulges in a range of adult-only activities from shooting to archery, told Today.com 'every now and then it is a good thing to swing your panties over your head and give a rebel yell'.

Travel trend: The South Carolina Wildlife Federation runs an annual camp for adult women

While the agenda follows a more grown-up 
theme, the aim of meeting like-minded people and learning new skills 
remain primary objectives.Â 

During the three-day retreat run by the South Carolina Wildlife Federation, which Ms Roberts has attended for the past four years, women can get involved with a range of activities including shooting, paddle boarding and archery.

Sara Green, who was responsible for organising this year's event revealed: 'A lot of the women are really just 
excited to try new things.

'We see people who are just happy to be
away from home and sit back and other women who jump in and try as many
things as they can.'

According to grownupcamps.com there are more than 800 grown-up camps across the U.S.

While traditional summer retreats, with campfires and s'mores-making sessions, are the first choice for many, more unusual adult camps have emerged.

The Rock 'N Roll Fantasy Camp in Las Vegas gives residents the opportunity to learn an instrument, write and record an original song and perform it live at the MGM Grand Hotel.

And the adults-only Zombie Survival Course in New Jersey shows participants how to create shelter, use fire-arms and build and lead a team.

Peg Smith, CEO of the American Camp Association (ACA) confirmed that travel operators have experienced increased demand for dedicated adult camp programs

She told FoxNews.com that some of the most popular picks include 'traditional camps offering an electronics-free experience in a natural environment, to skills-focused camps that allow adults to learn or practice physical, intellectual, or spiritual activities.'
