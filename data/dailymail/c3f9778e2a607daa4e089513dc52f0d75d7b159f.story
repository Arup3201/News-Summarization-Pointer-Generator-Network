Vanilla Ice is free on bond after being charged with burglary of a $1million mansion and grand theft.

The rapper-turned-home improvement show host, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was arrested in Lantana, Florida, on Wednesday amid allegations he broke into a vacant home and stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 

The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle, 47, was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's home, police say. 

This as it have been reported he told his work crew he owned the home and sent them over twice to burgle the property.

According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.'

Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property.

The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk?

'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense.

'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.'

The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF.

Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'.

He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 

'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done.

'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.'

Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County.

The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft.

'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.'

The items have been returned to their owner.

According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show.

He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 

'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.'

DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. 

The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. 

Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. 

He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus.

'I still don’t know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.'

Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. 

This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun.

A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. 

He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions.

In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her.

The case was dropped two weeks later.
