A man killed his partner and  left her body in a hotel room before taking his own life, police said yesterday. 

Detectives launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman, believed to be in her early forties, was found in a room at a Premier Inn at 9am on Saturday. 

At around 5.30pm the same day police received a report that a man in his late thirties had died on a  railway line. 

The man, who was found dead on  railway lines at Nuneaton, Warwickshire, killed his wife in a hotel room 70 miles away, police say

His body was found on the tracks in Nuneaton, Warwickshire – just over 60 miles from the Premier Inn in Kempston, Bedfordshire. 

Detectives yesterday confirmed that the man was believed to be  the same person they were trying  to trace in connection with the  hotel murder. 

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman also confirmed the pair were in  a relationship. 

A post-mortem examination was due to take place yesterday on the woman, who was revealed to be from Milton Keynes. 

The post-mortem examination of the man will take place this week. 

Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brunning, from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ‘Our deepest condolences are with the families  of the two people involved in  this case. 

'Both families are being supported by specialist family  liaison officers. 

‘I can confirm that officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with both deaths. 

‘However, the inquiry will now proceed on behalf of HM Coroner, who will conduct an inquest in due course which will outline the circumstances surrounding the investigation.’ 

He added: ‘Officers will continue to seek information connected to this investigation to assist the Coroner and I would urge anyone who may have information but who has not yet contacted the police to do  so now.’

The woman's body was found on Saturday morning at the Premier Inn at Kempston, Bedfordshire.  She is believed to be in her 40s and from nearby Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (file picture)
