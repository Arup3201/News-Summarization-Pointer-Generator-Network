Fancy owning a slice of motoring history? Well now you can as long as you have very deep pockets.

The birthplace of iconic British sports car maker Aston Martin has been put on the market for a cool £2.5 million.

Number 16 Henniker Mews is a three-bedroom property tucked away in a posh part of Chelsea.

History: The oldest existing Aston Martin A3 and the newest V12 Vanquish outside the birthplace of the classic British marque, which is on the market for £2.5 million

Apart from the plaque on the door there is little sign that this is where one of the world's most iconic motoring brands was born

And on January 15, 1913, it was the base for business buddies Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin.

The engineers formed Bamford & Martin Ltd and used the property’s garage as a workshop for the fledgling car manufacturer.

At Henniker Mews the duo developed their first model, known as the ‘Coal Scuttle’, completing it in 1915.

After an impressive performance at the Aston hill climb, they decided to rename the firm Aston Martin.

It is hard to believe from this posh Chelsea interior, that it was where the first Aston Martin was built

These sleek interiors and a slice of motoring history could be yours for £2.5 million

The Coal Scuttle, for all its importance, is no longer thought to exist with records showing it was last registered in 1928.

But fast-forward 100 years and Aston Martin, now based in Gaydon, Warwickshire goes from strength to strength having built more than 60,000 high-performance models.

The owners of 16 Henniker Mews have now decided to put their home up for sale after living at the address for 17 years.

It has been put on the market with the Farrar & Co estate agency for £2.5 million. This is the equivalent of 78 Aston Martin Cygnets, 30 V8 Vantages or 13 Vanquish models.

But it is less than the famous Bond DB5, which would set you back in excess of £2.5 million while a unique Aston Martin DB4 ‘Jet’ sold earlier this year for £3.2 million.

Spread over 1,217sq/ft, 16 Henniker Mews boasts three bedrooms including one with ensuite, a large reception room and a kitchen/breakfast room.

It has an interior designed by Mark Howarth and still boasts the famous garage while a plaque on the outside of the building shows off its famous past.

Julian Chambers, from Farrar & Co, said: 'We are delighted to be marketing a house with such a historic provenance.

'Our hope is that the eventual buyer is a car enthusiast that continues the use of the car garage, rather than integrating it into further reception space.'

Prior to its use by Aston Martin, 16 Henniker Mews was the London depot of engineering firm Hesse and Savory.

Would-be buyers looking for the badge of authenticity need look no further than the plague on the front of the property
