It was a bad day for the Washington Redskins as the football team was involved in a bus crash before a crowd of 5,000 protesters descended on the stadium rallying against the squad's divisive nickname.

The pandemonium appeared to be something of a bad omen as they then lost today's match against the Vikings in Minnesota.

Two of the Redskin team buses were driving with a police escort to the stadium at around 8.30am when one bus took a wrong turn and crashed into the back of the other.

The team was reportedly shaken up by the crash but no serious injuries were reported.

Moments later, thousands of demonstrators who had been marching through the University of Minnesota campus made their way to TCF Bank Stadium.

Native American leaders, local politicians, former sports stars and other speakers voiced their disdain for Redskins owner Dan Snyder and his refusal to change the nickname they've derided as derogatory and racist.

With many of the attendees wearing colorful, traditional Native American clothing and more holding signs, the gathering was by far the stiffest resistance for a Redskins road game and the latest push in a nationwide campaign that has cranked up over the last year. 

Protest: Tribes, Native American organizers and the University of Minnesota protested the name 'Redskins'

Anger: The two-hour demonstration featured talks from politicians, former sports stars, and tribe members

Chants: The crowds chanted 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, this racist name has got to go!' on their way to the stadium

Some people wore burgundy T-shirts with gold lettering, mimicking the team's logo with the words 'Rethink' and 'Rename' instead of Redskins.

'We're not mascots!' said former Vikings strong safety Joey Browner, one of 29 speakers who took the microphone on a lawn just steps from the stadium entrances.

Browner, who is part Native American, wore a black Vikings cap with a feather sticking up out of it.

'As a former player I feel really sad right now. ... This is still standing in front of us,' said Browner, a six-time Pro Bowl pick, who called the nickname a 'bullying tactic.'

Disappointment: The squad lost 26-29 against the Minnesota Vikings at the end of a bad Sunday for them

Hours later, the squad lost 26-29.

The NFL didn't immediately respond for comment on the protest. Commissioner Roger Goodell said earlier this year the nickname has been 'presented in a way that honors Native Americans.'

The two-hour series of speeches was a peaceful gathering, including folk music and Native American dancers.

As the rally got going, a group paraded along the sidewalk between the stadium and the stage, chanting: 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, this racist name has got to go!'
