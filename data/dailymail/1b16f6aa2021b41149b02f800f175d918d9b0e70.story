'Disappointed': Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's Middle East editor, spoke of his anger at the blunder

BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen has revealed that his sick father was wrongly denied food and water at an NHS hospital.

Mr Bowen, the corporation’s Middle East editor, spoke of his anger at the blunder on Twitter yesterday.

He told his 85,000 followers that his father Gareth, who has dementia and is bedridden, was classed as ‘nil by mouth’ after an apparent staff error.

The pensioner went in to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, with suspected pneumonia on Thursday night.

Mr Bowen, 54, wrote: ‘Univ Hospital Wales didn’t give my 84 yr old father food & water when there with chest infection. In error was “nil by mouth”.’

He later added: ‘My father now back at his care home in Cardiff after my brother and sister realised what was happening.’

Last night he explained that his father had been complaining of thirst, but his brother Matthew, 50, noticed his bottle of Ribena had not been opened.

He discovered Mr Bowen senior had been mistakenly classed ‘nil by mouth’. Mr Bowen said: ‘My father had no food or liquid for more than 24 hours.

‘The hospital have accepted that there was an error made at ward level. It is just disappointing that a man of 84 didn’t receive better care than this.’

He said that his father had worked with Labour MP Ann Clwyd at BBC Wales in the 1960s.

In December 2012, Miss Clwyd told how she found her dying husband, Owen Roberts, lying ‘like a battery hen’ against the bars of his bed at the hospital.

She said nurses treated him with ‘resentment, indifference and even contempt’.

Mr Bowen, of South London, returned from the Middle East last week. He said he will travel to Cardiff today in the wake of the ‘concerning’ blunder.

His other brother, Nicholas, 52, a QC, said: ‘My father has vascular dementia and has been very poorly. We have had a series of extremely unfortunate interactions with the Welsh NHS.

‘He’s now getting exceptionally good care as a result of decisions being made by the social services. My father had been transferred to the hospital and my brother, Matthew, discovered he had been without food or water all day.

‘Apparently the staff had been calling my father by the wrong name too.

‘As a result of having no food or water my father’s cognitive state had deteriorated enormously. Matthew raised merry hell and within two-and-a-half hours my father was back at the care home.

‘It begs the question what may have happened if he hadn’t visited?’

Mr Bowen senior, a former South Wales Echo reporter, was one of the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster in October 1966, in which a colliery tip collapsed on to a village primary school, killing 144 people, most of them children.

A spokesman for the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: ‘We are very sorry to hear of the concerns outlined in Mr Bowen’s tweet and an investigation into the very serious issue he raises is already underway. We are, therefore, not in a position to comment further.’
