A  Royal Marine officer who met the Duchess of Cornwall has been jailed for the sexual abuse of a young girl.

Warrant Officer Tony Jacka, 50, was unmasked as a paedophile after boasting to other sex offenders about his crimes online.

The former Regimental Sergeant Major of 3 Commando Brigade repeatedly indecently touched his victim, a court heard this week.

But prosecutors had previously failed to take the case to court due to a perceived 'lack of evidence' - despite the girl having gone to police.

The father-of-two and Iraq war veteran spent three years accessing indecent images of children from his naval base, a court heard.

During that period, as second in command of his unit he showed the Duchess of Cornwall around HMS Drake, a service personnel rehab unit.

Police later searched his computer and discovered 139 indecent images of children and messages Jacka had sent to other paedophiles bragging about his previous assaults.

Jailing Jacka for four-and-a-half years Judge Graham Cottle said the offences were 'completely abhorrent'.

He criticised a decision by the CPS not to prosecute him five years ago, when the girl was interviewed by police.

The court heard Jacka indecently touched a girl while based at RMB Chivenor near Barnstaple, Devon.

Prosecuting, Lee Brembridge, said his victim complained to the police and was interviewed in 2009.

But the CPS failed to take the case to court because of a 'lack of supporting evidence' in a decision the lawyer described as 'strange'.

Jacka was finally charged with assaulting the girl after police discovered 139 indecent images of children downloaded between 2010 and 2013 while he was at Devonport Naval Base.

The Afghanistan veteran showed the Duchess of Cornwall around HMS Drake in 2013 when she visited Hasler Company, a unit for the rehabilitation of service personnel.

Defending, David Evans, said: 'For a number of years, [Jacka] was to a certain extent living a lie. He has buried his head in the sand.'

He said Jacka was willing to tackle his problems and had 'supported injured personnel with emotional issues'.

Jacka, of Ivybridge, Devon, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault of the girl and four counts of sexual activity with a child.

He also admitted making 139 indecent images of children between 2010 and 2013.

Jacka grew up in Ludgvan, Cornwall, and after joining the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in 1983, served in Cambodia, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.

He was given the Meritorious Service Medal for his outstanding contribution to the welfare of disabled and wounded soldiers.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said after the case: 'We will consider the effect of this conviction on his service career. It would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases.'
