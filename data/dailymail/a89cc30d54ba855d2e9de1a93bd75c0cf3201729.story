A couple and their two pet dogs have been found dead following a suspected murder-suicide.

The bodies of all four were found in a bed after a colleague of Mr Rector visited the trailer because he was concerned the 30-year-old had not turned up at work for a week.

According to the New York Daily News, detectives investigating the horrific incident believe that Stacy, 28, first shot her husband before killing the dogs and herself.

A police statement said: 'Investigators are waiting for medical autopsy reports to make final determinations as to who caused this tragic event and why.'

Tributes have been paid to the couple from those who knew them.

One woman wrote on New Jersey.com: 'Stacy and Scott were great people. They were great friends of my ex-stepson and I am sure if there were signs their friends and family would have done something.'

Another friend said Mr Rector loved the outdoors and his dogs.

'He was the kind of person who put a smile on your face just being around him. He made life fun and touched so many peoples lives. '

Police have not revealed whether they have previously been called to the Rector's home for domestic violence incidents.
