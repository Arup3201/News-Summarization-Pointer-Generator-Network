A Dallas-area man was sentenced to death Saturday for killing his children's baby sitter to prevent her from testifying that he raped her.

Franklin Davis,31, admitted in court to killing 16-year-old Shania Gray, describing how he lured her into his car outside her school, shot her, stepped on her throat, and dumped her body in a river in September 2012.

He left his disposable cell-phone that he'd used to lure her, his shoes, and the gun in a pond and in a drainage ditch reports Dallas News.

But he said he killed her out of revenge and hatred, not to obstruct the sexual assault case that was nearing trial.

A Dallas jury convicted Davis of capital murder Tuesday before sentencing him to death.

Gray was remembered as a vivacious, friendly girl who often played basketball in the family driveway. Most people did not know that she was at the center of the sexual assault case against Davis.

Her mother told police in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite that Davis sexually assaulted Gray while she was baby-sitting his children.

The Dallas News reports that the girl says Davis raped her when she was 14-years-old.

Davis, known by the nickname 'Wish,' exposed himself and had sex with the girl four separate times in 2011, according to a police affidavit.

Davis continued to deny the allegations at his trial.

'She lied,' Davis said on the stand, according to Dallas television station KTVT. 'She ruined my life. She took everything from me, everything I work so hard to get. She took it.'

In the days before he killed Gray, Davis called and sent her text messages pretending to be a boy and asking her questions about the sexual assault case.

He also reportedly sent himself fake texts denying the sexual assault allegations that appeared to come from Shaniaâ€™s phone

The day of the killing, Gray got a text message saying her new friend 'D' was outside her school to surprise her.

Davis' defense attorneys argued he was trying to do his own investigation after police did not. But prosecutors scoffed at that notion.

'You know it, I know it and he knows it,' prosecutor Russell Wilson told jurors, according to The Dallas Morning News.

His persecutors reminded the jury of Davis' his repeated assaults of women and his assault of a guard when he escaped while in custody . They did this to show that he is a future danger reported the Dallas News.

The Defense team for Davis asked persecutors to have mercy on him because he grew up in St. Louis with a neglectful mother and a grandfather who sexually molested him.
