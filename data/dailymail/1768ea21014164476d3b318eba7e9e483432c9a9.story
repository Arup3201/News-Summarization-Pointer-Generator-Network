The biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company is on the cards after American drugs giant Pfizer revealed it was preparing a £60billion bid for AstraZeneca.

London-based AstraZeneca, which produces drugs combating diabetes, high cholesterol and cancer for millions of patients, has already rejected two offers from the maker of Viagra this year, saying they ‘very significantly undervalued AstraZeneca and its prospects’.

And yesterday, Pfizer’s chief executive Ian Read admitted that if its takeover bid was successful there are no guarantees that thousands of manufacturing jobs at AstraZeneca will remain in the UK.

Overtures: Pfizer has admitted making two multi-0billion pound approaches for UK rival AstraZenica

The firm is one of the largest in Britain and one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. It has eight factories in the UK and has expanded across the globe to sell billions of pounds worth of its products in more than 100 countries.

If the deal goes ahead it will be the latest in a long line of British firms to have fallen prey to foreign takeovers, including Cadbury and Boots the chemist. A merger would create the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals firm, worth £150billion.

Pfizer, whose best-known drug is erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra, decided to go public about its takeover intentions after AstraZeneca ‘declined to engage’ in full-blown merger talks. However, the GMB trade union claimed a deal would see the US giant shift UK-based jobs to the Far East. A spokesman said: ‘This is not good news.’

In 2011, Pfizer closed its main research plant in Sandwich, Kent, with the loss of 2,400 jobs.

Pfizer now has 28 days to either table a firm offer or walk away. Once it has made an official bid, AstraZeneca would need to seek approval from its shareholders.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘My priority is ensuring there are high-skilled jobs and long-term investment in research and development in the UK. The chief executive of Pfizer has informed me of his intentions, and I have emphasised the importance of these points.’

If ever there was a  moment to be fearful for Britain’s future as an advanced science-based manufacturing economy it is now.

The American bid for AstraZeneca is not only the biggest attempted foreign takeover in UK history, but is a direct assault on high-quality and skilled British jobs.

The predator, US drugs giant Pfizer, makes no secret of the reasons why it has cynically targeted the rival British firm. It is because it fears it is running out of ideas for new drug compounds in its own laboratories and also wants the tax advantages of moving its HQ to the UK.

Mega deal: The deal for AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a UK business

But if the takeover deal goes ahead, it would have a devastating effect on Britain’s status as home to some of the world’s most respected brands.

Since Pfizer shares are quoted in New York, with its main markets in the US and most investors based there, the promise to move to Britain is no more than a ploy to cut taxes and to browbeat AstraZeneca investors into submission and to gull our weak politicians into approving the deal.

The challenge is a huge test for Chancellor George Osborne. For only last month he boasted he wanted to create ‘new centres for doctoral training and for cell therapy’ in Britain. Indeed, these are areas where AstraZeneca is a world leader. But Mr Osborne’s patriotism has been questioned. Rather than jumping to the defence of one of the nation’s most successful industries, he seems to have sold the pass, saying that any deal would be ‘a commercial matter between the two companies’.

Compare this spineless stance with that of the French government, which in recent days has expressed ‘patriotic concern’ amid talk that the US conglomerate General Electric has bid for its French rival Alstom’s energy business.

Sadly, such a failure to support one of the UK’s key industries fits a depressing pattern that has been the shameful mark of both Tory-led and Labour governments, which have allowed a long list of British companies to fall under overseas ownership. Most recently, ministers watched as Cadbury ran up the white flag in the face of the greater financial muscle of American food giant Kraft. Before that, we sold the British airports operator BAA to Spanish group Ferrovial, and control of our ports passed from P&O into foreign hands.

And most of our power utilities have been sold to continental giants such as EDF of France. To compound matters, we have even entrusted state-controlled EDF to build our next generation of nuclear power stations with questionable Chinese government money.

As for AstraZeneca and the rest of the British pharmaceutical industry, their importance to our current and future economy cannot be over-estimated. This one firm contributes 3 per cent to national output and together with other drug companies (including its bigger rival GlaxoSmithKline) contributes 10 per cent to national output.

When a Harvard University academic looked at the sectors of the British economy which hold key competitive advantages over other Western nations, pharmaceuticals and aerospace (along with the currently disgraced financial services sector) came out on top.

What’s more, Pfizer has a less than honourable record in Britain. In 2011, its bosses closed its only research and development facility in the UK with the loss of 2,400 research and laboratory jobs.

Contrast this with our own drugs industry’s universally admired record of developing new products.  AstraZeneca is planning to spend £350million on a centre at a science park based at Cambridge and is developing new treatments for cancer and respiratory disorders.

George Osborne may be reluctant to speak up now in support of AstraZeneca but has, in the past, shown that he recognises how crucial it is to invest in such areas –having offered tax incentives that have had a hugely positive impact on the attractiveness of the UK as a centre for pioneering research. This persuaded Glaxo to bring back to Britain £1billion of investment from labs around the world.

Moreover, we should not forget that AstraZeneca, despite its concocted name, is a company with deep British roots – once part of world-famous Imperial Chemical Industries that, with the genius of Liverpool-born Sir John Brunner, was created in the 1920s.

If only our politicians had learnt the lessons of history and been alert to the warning signs of allowing British treasure to be flogged to foreigners. For, I fear, we are witnessing a repeat of the Cadbury scandal.

Pfizer has promised investors in AstraZeneca that the UK would be the centre of its research activity, but as Cadbury’s buyer Kraft showed, the record of US companies making promises to British shareholders and politicians is pretty disreputable. Kraft pledged to keep open the Cadbury plant near Bristol, but then closed it just weeks after the takeover, moving manufacturing to Poland. It also promised not to cut jobs at Bournville, Cadbury’s spiritual home, but then proceeded to do so.

Pfizer, like Kraft, is a company known for buying rivals, cutting costs and absorbing the best parts of the business and then selling off the rest. That is why AstraZeneca should be protected. For too long, our governments have sat idly by as foreign companies have scooped up great swathes of our industrial infrastructure and raided hi-tech companies for their patents.

No other nation would countenance the idea of one of its greatest companies falling into overseas hands in a deal that would be bad for jobs, bad for science, bad for UK taxpayers – who, over the years, have invested in the training of these firms’ great brains – and, above all, bad for Britain.
