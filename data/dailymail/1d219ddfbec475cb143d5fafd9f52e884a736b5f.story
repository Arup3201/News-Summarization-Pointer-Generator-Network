A couple have quietly footed a $105,000 bill to cover the cost of helping a five-year-old cancer victim fulfill his dream of becoming Batman for the day.

Philanthropists John and Marcia Goldman have handed San Francisco a cheque to pay for the costs of a huge party held for 'BatKid' leukemia patient Miles Scott.

As many as 12,000 people turned out to help make Miles' wish - granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation - come true, and millions more watched on from around the world, including President Obama, who tweeted in support of the brave little boy.

But the bill - amassed renting a sound system, video screens and other equipment to accommodate the surprisingly large crowd that - topped $105,000.

As Miles worked his way around the city, crowds of San Franciscans lined the streets to watch his heroics.

First, he rescued a damsel in distress, then he foiled a dastardly plan to rob the bank by the Riddler, and his third challenge was to rescue mascot Lou Seal from the clutches of the Penguin.

The little boy was first diagnosed with leukemia when he was 18 months old.

He finished his latest treatment in June and is now in remission. 

The Goldmans told SFGate that they had read that the Make-A-Wish Foundation was trying to raise the money to pay back the city for the setup and public safety costs surrounding the event.

Mr Goodman added: 'We thought, 'Wait a minute - they shouldn't have to pay for such a good deed and such an amazing event.

'We've supported Make-A-Wish for some time.

'What a great way to celebrate something really amazing. It brought out the best in the city and showed it to the world.'

The pint-sized superhero sped around in a Batmobile – with a police motorcycle escort and news helicopters circling overhead – as he vanquished crime. Batkid Saves City, screamed the headlines on a special edition of The San Francisco – or rather Gotham City – Chronicle.

And President Obama sent a taped message from the White House saying: ‘Way to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham!’

At the end of the day, Mayor Ed Lee presented Miles with a giant chocolate key to the city as a huge, cheering crowd gathered outside City Hall.

Miles’s mother Natalie, from Oregon, had written to the Make-A-Wish Foundation saying her ailing son dreamed of being a mini crimefighter.

The surprise was a complete shock to the youngster, who thought he was visiting San Francisco to pick up a Batman costume when the action started happening.

She said at the time:  ‘It was a day he will remember forever. People were lining the streets. I
 have been in tears from the outpouring of love, kindness and humanity 
that has been shown to my son.’ In real life, Miles has defeated an 
enemy more deadly than any supervillain.

'He has been fighting 
leukaemia since he was 18 months old, but he underwent his final surgery
 last month, and the cancer is now in remission.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee thanks Batkid for his efforts in front of the crowds. It emerged that the city paid out $105,000 for the day, which granted Miles Scott's wish to be a superhero

‘This day has meant an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son’s body,’ Mrs Scott added.

‘He is our superhero.’

Police Chief Greg Suhr, who recorded mayday messages to set Batkid on his missions, said: ‘This is one of those days which makes me so proud. It has turned into a full-blown phenomenon. 

‘Everyone joined together to make this young boy’s dream come true.’
