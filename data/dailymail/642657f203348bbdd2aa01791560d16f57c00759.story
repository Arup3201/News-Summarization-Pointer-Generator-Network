They said the Galikowskas had seemed a loving family but the couple are understood to have separated shortly before Christmas last year. 

The pair, who attended a local Roman Catholic church, are believed to have met around seven years ago, after they both moved from Poland to the UK to look for work, and married in 2008 – shortly before the birth of their first daughter.

Mr Galikowska found work in a timber yard then as a refuse collector, while Mrs Galikowska had worked as a waitress and at clothes store TK Maxx before becoming a full-time mother.

Neighbours told how police called to the scene on Sunday evening arrested a man as he loaded belongings into the car on the driveway of the house.

Neighbour Matthew Houghton, 30, said: ‘My brother said he heard a woman screaming, that someone was being killed, so we ran up the street.

‘There was a woman already on the phone to the police. She was hysterical, saying they were all dead, that they’d all been stabbed.

‘She’d been in the house and seen it. Another woman who lives next door is a nurse, and she’d been inside too and checked their pulse, but they were all dead.’

Kelly Hughes, 31, who also lives nearby said: 'I heard shouting on the street and there was police everywhere. The cops were shouting "open the door" at a man sat in a car.

'My partner saw him being put on the ground and arrested. It’s scary knowing it’s right on your doorstep.

'I knew the woman by sight. She would walk past my house every day and go up to take her daughter to school.

'I used to see her with a pram and the older girl would run ahead. We never spoke but she always smiled.'

One parent said: 'The school did a special assembly for the pupils following the deaths.

'A lot of the mums are awfully upset about it. I don’t know how the school is going to handle it. It’s all up in the air at the moment.

'I don’t know what to tell my kids because I feel like I need to tell them what’s happened.' 

Friends of the family and residents on the quiet estate in the Stanfield area of Stoke-on-Trent spoke yesterday of their shock at the tragedy.

‘She seemed to really enjoy being a mum.’

Tragedy: Chief Superintendent Martin Evans said that as the investigation continues 'it is becoming clearer we are dealing with a very tragic incident'

Another friend, Anna Gemzala, 32, said: ‘I can’t believe it. I would see Marta and the kids at the Polish church. They are a nice family. They have beautiful children, it’s so sad.’

Friends described the couple as dedicated and proud parents.

One neighbour said: ‘They adored little Maja – she was so pretty and lively so when they had another little girl everyone was pleased for them.

‘We used to see them in the street and they were perfect. The little girl had a beaming smile. It is absolutely heartbreaking.’

Sunny Miah, 45, the couple’s former landlord, said: ‘I really can’t believe it, they were such a loving, friendly, pleasant couple.

‘It is an absolute tragedy. They were both very hardworking and dedicated and seemed very much in love with each other.’
