The millionaire polo mogul charged in the death of a promising young student is heading to prison.

John Goodman, of West Palm Beach, Florida, was sentenced to 16 years behind bars on Friday following a fatal drunken-driving crash back in 2010 that claimed the life of 23-year-old Scott Wilson.

This is the second time Goodman has been convicted and sentenced, with his first conviction being overturned due to juror misconduct.

The jury had been brought in from Tampa on this case because of pretrial publicity according to The Houston Chronicle.

Wilson, an engineering graduate, was killed February 12, 2010, when Goodman, the millionaire founder of The Palm Beach International Polo Club, rammed his Bentley into the victim's Hyundai and sent it flying into a canal. 

Goodman then left the scene of the crime and then waited an hour to call 911, claiming his battery was dead on his cell phone.

After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 percent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

Goodman had been drinking at The Players Club that evening, a nearby bar, and admitted to having at least four shots, though he claimed he was not drunk at the time of the crash. 

He blamed his high alcohol level on drinks he had after the crash.

Lavish: Goodman at one point adopted his girlfriend to protect his $300million fortune and estate (above) from a civil suit

Goodman made headlines before the trial when he legally adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins to protect his vast $300million lawsuit from Wilson's parents in a civil suit, though he did ultimately end up paying out millions.

He then made headlines again when, while under house arrest and with a guard present, he tried to pry of his ankle monitor using a hand mirror.

Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when Goodman ran a stop sign.
