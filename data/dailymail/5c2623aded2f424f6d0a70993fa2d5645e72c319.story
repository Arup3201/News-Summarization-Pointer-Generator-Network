Just hours after allegedly shaking his girlfriend's 1-year-old baby so hard that the boy ultimately died, 36-year-old meth addict Bransen Locks was found cowering in a crawl space under his Nevada home and arrested on warrants unrelated to the baby's death. Yesterday, he was charged with murder.

According to authorities, Locks was watching his girlfriend's two children - the boy, Bently Olsen, and his 5-year-old sister - on May 19, when Locks' mother called 9-1-1 to report that Bently had been injured.

The boy was rushed to University Medical Center Las Vegas with what first responders described as severe head injuries, including bleeding on the brain and a 'noticeable midline shift of the brain.' Medical personnel also noted a red abrasion on the top of the boy's head that appeared to be 'very recent.'

The injuries, doctors concluded, were consistent with shaken baby syndrome.

Bently died from his injuries a week later.

Locks initially told authorities the boy had suffered a seizure, which is what caused his injuries. But a firefighter who rode to the hospital with Locks and the boy told police he was inconsistent when answering questions about how the boy was injured.

When police arrived at the hospital, Locks was gone. He was found a few hours later hiding in the crawl space.

In a police interview with Bently's 5-year-old sister, the girl told authorities that Locks hurt her brother in what she called 'brave pokies' while they were playing in a tree house in his backyard.

Following his arrest, Locks' mother told detectives that 'it's been a rough year with [Locks] and his drug problem.'

The Clark County coroner's office is yet to release an official cause of death.

Locks - who already was behind bars for unrelated, outstanding warrants - has been charged with one count of murder and two counts of child abuse, including causing substantial mental harm to the boy's sister.

Locks is due back in court on July 25.
