Southampton's Champions League qualification hopes have cooled of late - so it was perhaps fitting that manager Ronald Koeman took his players to snowy Switzerland for a mid-season team break.

The Barclays Premier League's surprise package of the season have dropped off the pace in the race for the top four recently, and their Dutch boss has seen fit to organise a three-day football-free trip to the Swiss Alps - and Koeman even found time to play ice hockey as his team take a break from training.

With a weekend off after being knocked out of the FA Cup and having slipped to four points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, the Southampton players have an 11-day gap to chill out before next Saturday's league visit to leaders Chelsea.

The trip is all about rest for Koeman and his worn-out players, who seem to be feeling the strain of a long campaign, although there are 'activities' planned that are 'good for the health and the body'.

'It’s a team building trip, we will stay together, we will do some different activities and it’s good for the health and good for the body,' Koeman said.

'They will have some free time to do what they what and that will be good for us until Saturday.'

The Dutchman hopes his side can refocus and regain energy ahead of the final push in their last 10 league games of the season.

'It’s a big achievement what we have until now,' he said. 'There are still ten games and we know we will fight until the last second to keep the highest position in the table that is possible.'

The trip seems to be getting a mixed reception from the players though: While Toby Alderweireld posed for a photo with 'his boys' surrounded by snow, January signing Eljero Elia tweeted: 'It's too cold for me'.
