We may think of binge drinking as a distinctly modern phenomenon, but these extraordinary mugshots remind us that police have been attempting to tackle alcohol abuse for decades.

The images from the early 1900s show a succession of women who were banned from their local pubs in Birmingham after being arrested and dubbed 'habitual drunkards'.

The problem drinkers - some of whom look distinctly sinister although others have a much more respectable air - were placed on the city's 'Black List', barring them getting served in pubs.

Sinister: One-eyed Kate Kibble is one of the 37 women banned from Birmingham's pubs in 1902

Miscreant: Alice Tatlow, another woman whose mugshot was published to warn publicans about her, had the Prince of Wales's feathers tattooed on her right foot

Middle-aged: But Mary Bayliss is one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham

Officials circulated a list of 82 
drunkards - including 37 women - around Birmingham's pubs, warning 
landlords to keep an eye out for them.

Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their 'stout builds' and 'oval faces'.

The historical discovery was unearthed by family-tree website ancestry.co.uk.

A spokesman said: 'In order to 
enforce the 1902 Sale of Liquor to Habitual Drunkardâ€™s Licensing Act, 
the Watch Committee of the City of Birmingham provided licensed liquor 
sellers and clubs with photos and descriptions of people deemed 
"habitual drunkards", who were not to be sold liquor.

Drunk: Many of those on the city's 'Blacklist', like Susannah Booton, had been arrested for public drunkenness

Young: Most of the women on the list were aged between 30 and 40; this is Sarah Henson

'Habitual drinkers': Elizabeth Thompson is pictured after her arrest for being drunk in public

'The 82 persons in the book were convicted of drunkenness between 1903 and 1906, typically at the Birmingham City Police Court.'

Many of the women featured on the 
list bore physical deformities and tattoos, which would have marked them
 out from respectable Edwardian society.

However, most of them managed to hold down jobs, working as charwomen, wood-choppers, polishers or grease merchants.

Ferocious: Sarah Teresa Evans and Ellen Heaton are yet more fierce-looking women with a drinking problem

Criminal: Annie Hodgkins, alias 'Hodgkiss', was charged with being drunk and disorderly

Jobless: But unlike Eliza Fallon, many of the women were gainfully employed as cleaners or similar

Poster: Documents with their pictures and physical descriptions were circulated by police

List: The astonishing historical documents have recently been unearthed by a family-tree website

One was a street performer who played the tin whistle for money outside pubs, and several made a living as prostitutes.

Most of the women apparently sometimes went under aliases, suggesting they were habitual criminals.

While drunkenness is today associated 
primarily with the young, only two of the women were under 25, with five
 of them over the age of 50.

Trouble: Despite her 46 years, Mary Bayliss was clearly not as mature as could be hoped

Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute

Suspicious: Elizabeth Thompson held three additional aliases, pointing to a criminal background

Scarred: Susannah Booton is one of many women to bear facial disfigurements

Disabled: Sarah Evans was suffering from a severe disfigurement which made her nose fall in

Law: The mugshots are a result of a 1902 law aiming to crack down on public drunkenness
