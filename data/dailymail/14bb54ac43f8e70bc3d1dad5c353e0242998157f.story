Two Burmese workers charged with the murder of two British tourists in Thailand  have pleaded
not guilty, their lawyer said on Monday.

Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun are on trial for the murder of 24-year-old David Miller and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on the island of Koh Tao in September. 

Police say DNA taken from the Burmese migrant workers, both aged 21, matched samples found on the victims. The pair initially confessed to the murders but later retracted their confessions, saying they had been made under duress.

On Thursday, Thai prosecutors filed charges against the Burmese men ranging from conspiracy to commit murder and rape to
illegal entry. They were taken to court on the island of Samui
on Monday to hear the charges.

'They pleaded not guilty to all the charges today,' Thanu
Akekachote, a lawyer representing the pair, told Reuters. 'It is
my understanding that the court wants to speed this up given its
impact on tourism and international relations.'

The investigation into the murders has been marred by allegations of police incompetence and torture. The suspects said they were beaten and threatened by police - allegations which police deny.

Last week the head of the defendants' legal team said defense witnesses had refused to come forward because they were too scared to speak up on behalf of low-status migrant workers in a case which has garnered global attention.

Rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats.

The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured.

In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene.

On Saturday the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case.

'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office.

'We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes.'

Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds.

'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement.

Nakhon Chomphuchat, lawyer for Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, speaks with media. Last week he said defense witnesses had refused to come forward because they were too scared to speak up on behalf of low-status migrant workers

They added: 'They must respond to these charges, and their arguments must be considered with the same scrutiny as those of the prosecution.

'Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.' 

Tourism generates almost 10 per cent of gross domestic
product and Thailand was already struggling to recover from
months of political upheaval that culminated in a May 22 coup,
with the unrest keeping some visitors away.

Thailand is still under martial law, which was imposed two
days before the coup.
