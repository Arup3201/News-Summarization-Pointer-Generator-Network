The former German chancellor Helmut Kohl branded the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana 'idiotic', an explosive new book has claimed.

The 84-year-old, who led Germany from 1982 to 1998, also added that had Diana become queen immediately, she 'would have done her bit in bed'.

It has also emerged he described Prince Philip as a 'blockhead' and accused former prime minister Margaret Thatcher of falling asleep at meetings.

In the book, Mr Kohl says the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was an 'absolutely idiotic' affair 

The claims come in a controversial book by by journalist Heribert Schwan and is based on extensive interviews with the former chancellor.

According to the book, Mr Kohl told Mr Schwan that while Prince Charles was 'entirely friendly', he was unimpressed with his marriage to Diana Spencer in 1981.

He said: 'Her marriage was an absolutely idiotic affair.

'Had she become queen immediately she would have done her bit in bed, created three princes and her duty to the nation would have been fulfilled. But like this she had to travel around, talk to mayors and so on and then she withered away.'

The royal family also comes in for more criticism with Prince Philip described as a 'blockhead'.

The former chancellor also criticises the behaviour of Prince Philip, pictured with the Queen, describing him as a 'blockhead' 

The book also accuses Margaret Thatcher of falling asleep during meetings saying she would 'doze off during summits' 

Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life in recent years, had instructed lawyers to halt the publication, of 'Legacy: the Kohl transcripts'.

Mr Schwan had been asked to write the former chancellor's memoirs and had already conducted more than 600 hours of taped interviews between 2001 and 2002 when the pair fell out.

Earlier this year, a court told the journalist he must return the tapes, but he was able to delay handing them over until he was able to make full transcripts of the conversations, and published the book without Mr Kohl's permission.

Meanwhile the book also features Mr Kohl's views on other former world leaders, including Margaret Thatcher.

In one interview he recalled how the former prime minister would 'doze off during summits and nearly fall of her chair, clutching her handbag.'

He claimed that former US president Bill Clinton, pictured, could not focus his mind because he was too busy dealing with the Monica Lewinsky affair 

He also spoke about former US president Bill Clinton, saying he could not focus his mind, because he was too busy dealing with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Meanwhile he has also claimed that current German chancellor Angela Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together.'

But the co-author of the book has defended its publication saying it shows Mr Kohl is a man with a sense of humour.

In recent years, Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life since suffering a bad fall and lives with his 50-year-old wife.
