Two nurses faked patient records to meet targets at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital - with one also found to have used foul mouthed language about patients.

Sharon
Turner and Tracy White falsified accident and emergency discharge times
to avoid missing a government goal for patients to be dealt with within
four hours.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) also found that nurse Sharon Turner used foul mouthed language about patients and threatened to make her colleague’s life 'hell'.

She also made racially-motivated comments about doctors at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and falsified A&E waiting times data, the nursing regulator found.

Disgraced: Sharon Turner, right, a nurse at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital used foul mouthed language about patients and threatened to make her colleague’s life 'hell'. Tracy White, left, was found to have changed patient records so it would appear her  department was meeting waiting time targets

Between December 2003 and October 2009, 
when Ms Turner worked at the trust, she spoke about patients and staff 
in an 'inappropriate manner', the NMC panel ruled.

On one occasion she said that she didn’t give a 'flying f***” about patients.

She also said 'they can f****** wait' and 'they want to get real', or words to that effect.

The panel also ruled that she made racially motivated comments about Asian junior doctors.

'What have you got in your rucksack doctor, is it a bomb?' she is reported to have said.

She is also accused of calling them 'suicide bombers' or 'Osama’s mate'.

The panel also found that she made inappropriate comments about three other colleagues.

With respect to one male nurse, she said she would 'would make his life hell and get rid of him in six months' and 'would drive him to drink and he would be out of here'.

And when he was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose she said words to the effect of: 'He should have taken a few more pills and done the job properly', the panel found.

She also said “I don’t care if she lives or dies”, or words to that effect, when another colleague was taken to hospital with a head injury, they said.

Under fire: Both nurses worked at Stafford Hospital

Ms Turner also said something along the lines of: “I am going to have her if it’s the last thing I do” about another nurse,.

In October 2007, she actively encouraged fellow nurses to 'lie about it' when she discovered that the trust was breaching the four hour treatment time target in A&E.

She also condemned colleagues for informing the clinical site manager about the breach.

They also found that she inaccurately recorded patient discharge times and instructed staff to transfer patients to wards with 'soiled sheets', the panel judged.

The panel ruled that most elements of the six charges of misconduct against her were 'proved' but they also ruled some elements, such as referring to a nurse as a 'junior muppet', were not proved.

An NMC panel also ruled that A&E nurse Tracey White  refused to help a senior nurse undress an elderly patient and called her a 'naughty little monkey' for refusing to take drugs to treat constipation.

They also found that in relation to a patient who had attended A&E following a termination of their pregnancy, Ms White said words to the effect of: 'she can wait, if you can do that to your baby'.

Between July 2000 and July 2010 she is also accused of inaccurately recording patient discharge times from A&E,and ordering other colleagues to follow her example.

The panel also ruled that she changed patient records so that it would appear that the department was meeting waiting time targets.

It also judged that she ordered staff to move patients on to a different parts of the hospital before they had been properly assessed by A&E staff and transferred patients to wards with soiled sheets, they found.

Ms White faced five charges of misconduct but the independent panel found that she had 'no case to answer for' for one allegation of falsifying computer records for the time a patient was admitted to A&E.

They also ruled that the facts were 'not proved' for some elements of the other allegations against her.

The independent panel will decide whether the pair are still fit to practice. If they deem that their fitness to practise is impaired, the panel will determine what sanctions should be imposed against the two women.

Stafford Hospital was the subject of a two-year public inquiry into its appalling standards of care.Official documents suggest up to 1,200 more patients than expected died at the Weston Road site between 2005 and 2008.

The inquiry highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' at the trust.Probes into the scandal revealed that many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication.

Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'Tracey White is still employed by the trust and works as a clinical site manager.

'We will need to take some time to consider the Nursing and Midwifery Council panel’s findings once they announce their decisions.

'Sharon Turner is no longer employed by the trust. She left her emergency department sister post in September 2009.'
