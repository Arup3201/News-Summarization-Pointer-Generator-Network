David Cameron is quietly sounding out Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny about becoming the next President of the European Union in a bid to boost his hopes of renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Downing Street officials are seeking a candidate who can stop Socialist Martin Schulz, the German left-winger who is currently President of the European Parliament and is backed by Labour.

Senior sources say Britain wants to block Mr Schulz ‘at all costs’ since his taste for more regulation on business would scupper efforts to make Europe more competitive.

The plotting came as Mr Cameron admitted that support for British membership of the EU is ‘wafer thin’ - something his aides fear could disappear if Mr Schulz replaces current Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso next year.

Mr Schulz first came to public attention in 2003 when former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi compared him to a concentration camp guard.

A confirmed EU federalist, he has previously demanded that the European Parliament sets EU budgets and repeatedly demands more money for Brussels - an attitude that would undermine Mr Cameron’s efforts to secure a new deal with the EU.

One insider told the Mail that picking Mr Schulz would be like returning to the centralising days of former Commission President Jacques Delors, a bitter opponent of British attempts to reclaim powers from Brussels.

Government sources in Dublin revealed that Mr Cameron’s officials have been in touch about whether Prime Minister Kenny fancies the job.

‘One of the people pushing this name out there is the man in Downing Street,’ a source told the Belfast Telegraph.

‘We have been getting questions from people in that building. [Cameron] has a high regard for [Kenny]. They would feel he would be sensitive to their sensitivities on Europe.’ 

One government source in London denied that Mr Cameron has settled on Mr Kenny as his chosen candidate but said: ‘The question is: how do you stop Schulz from winning? In terms of making Europe more competitive, more flexible and if you want to stop tying businesses up in red tape, he is not the man.’

The Prime Minister told business leaders that he was determined to secure a ‘yes’ vote in a promised in/out referendum on EU membership in 2017.

Warning: Boris Johnson said that Cameron needed to change Britain's relationship with the EU

But he told the CBI annual conference: ‘It is my judgment that our current consent of remaining inside the EU is wafer-thin - we have not made the argument enough about why Europe matters.

‘The British people were told about a Common market, about an economic area. So much has changed about this organisation and so little consent has been granted.

‘Let us reform this organisation, let’s make changes to how it works and put those changes to the British people in a referendum.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled a shopping list of changes to our relationship with the EU that he wants to see David Cameron come back from Brussels with.

And he warned that unless the Prime Minister is successful, the British people would vote to come out of the EU in 2017.

He told the BBC: ‘We need a totally new approach. The Prime Minister will find loads of allies around Europe if he says do we need all this employment law, do we need all this funny agricultural stuff, do we need a common fisheries policy?

‘Can’t we get rid of so many of these pointless intrusions by the European Union machine into the running of national life?

‘It’s unbelievable that in 2013, 60 or 70 years after the European movement as launched, we’re still having a system of agricultural subsidy - a support mechanism in which taxpayers pay subsidies to farmers in order to maintain the price of food.

‘I think that’s absolutely crazy in a globalised economy, it’s an anomaly, it’s an anachronism, we should get rid of it.’

He added: ‘I happen to think David Cameron has a massive chance now. He’s greatly respected among leaders and he could say to his colleagues around the table that in the end, unless you give me what I need, I’m afraid the British people are going to vote against.

‘They don’t want that, believe me - they want us in.’
