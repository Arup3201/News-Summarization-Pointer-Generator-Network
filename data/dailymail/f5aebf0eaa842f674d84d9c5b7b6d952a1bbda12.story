A seaside town has been crowned one of the country's prettiest resorts thanks to a dying banker who left it £2.3 million in his will - to be spent on a million flowers.

Canadian Keith Owen, 69, made his fortune in the financial industry and travelled the world but always returned to his favourite place - Sidmouth in Devon.

Mr Owen was born nearby and spent most of holidays in the coastal town admiring its beach, blooms and Regency architecture.

But when Owen was told he was suffering lung cancer and had just eight weeks to live he left the parish his retirement fund, pension and a string of properties.

Owen's massive £2.3m estate - £1,5m in cash and £800,000 from properties - was handed over with a stipulation it had to be spent on keeping Sidmouth 'beautiful'.

Before he died he also told officials some of the money should be spent on planting one million flower bulbs in the town.

Owen, who was divorced with no children, left all the money to the Sid Vale Association (SVA), Britain's oldest civic society.

The group decided to honour one of Owen's specific suggestions in August last year by planting the first few hundred thousand bulbs in verges, gardens, lawns and flowerbeds.

The daffodils, snowdrops and crocuses have since erupted into an explosion of colourful blooms, helping Sidmouth claim the prestigious Silver Gilt at the finals of the 50th Britain in Bloom.

Mr Owen was born not far from Sidmouth, and although living in Canada, he enjoyed visiting the town

Judges from the Royal Horticultural Society praised the resort for mobilising hundreds volunteers to plant more than 150,000 flowers in Owen's name.

Sidmouth in Bloom chairman Lynette Talbot was disappointed the town missed out on gold to St Peter Port in Guernsey but thrilled to claim silver for the first time ever.

She said: 'We have naturally have loved to win but knew our opponents were two gorgeous towns. We thank Sidmouth for its fantastic support.'

Owen was born in Totnes in Devon and became an RAF pilot, leaving the service in 1976 to start a new life and career in finance in Canada.

He moved to Ottawa and became a Canadian citizen but returned for regular visits to Sidmouth where his mother had retired.

After her death he regularly stayed in her small flat and described Sidmouth as the picture perfect English resort.

The remaining 850,000 bulbs will be planted in waves, as Sidmouth strives to maintain its beauty

But on one trip in October 2007 he was told he had cancer and Owen, a member of the Rotary Club and supporter of the Sid Vale Association, urgently gathered together civic leaders to discuss the massive gift before changing his will.

His will stated that the capital should remain untouched but each year the estimated £120,000 interest should be spent on schemes to spruce up Sidmouth and the neighbouring villages of Sidford and Sidbury.

The remaining 850,000 bulbs will be planted in waves, with the next scheduled dig on November 1.
