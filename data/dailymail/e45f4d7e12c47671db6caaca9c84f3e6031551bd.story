In life, Karen Lloyd enjoyed a coffee while shopping with friends. In fact, she liked it so much she was nicknamed ‘Costa Karen’.

So after the fun-loving mother of two died from cancer at 51, her family thought it only fitting that her funeral should feature a shot of something frothy too.

They commissioned a coffin in her favourite coffee shop Costa’s burgundy colour with the chain’s logo on the side.

for a Costa coffee-themed coffin after she died from cancer

The words ‘one shot, extra hot skinny latte’ – her drink of choice – were also written on one end of the wooden coffin.

Her husband Alan, 45, said yesterday: ‘The funeral was a celebration of her life and it’s good to do it on a humorous side.

‘When we asked the funeral directors for a Costa-themed coffin, they said, “We’ve never done one of those before”.

'But they managed to do one for us.’

It was made by Oxford firm Colourful Coffins and there were 450 mourners at the funeral in Swindon on Friday.

Mrs Lloyd was diagnosed with breast cancer in June and died on February 4, leaving behind her husband and sons Harry, 19, and Eddie, 15.

The coffin was carried into the church to the sound of 'More than a Woman' and, following the service, carried out to 'Viva Las Vegas'.

Lynzi Barrett, a close friend of Karen, said: 'She wanted a coffin with a difference and Alan, her husband, wondered what could be done regarding Costa.

'I telephoned Mark Hillier of Hillier Funeral Service and within an hour he called me back to say we could have it. It brought a smile to our faces at a time of sorrow.

'Both the funeral and wake were based around her love of Costa coffee, shopping and sleeping.

'We had pictures of her everywhere as she lit up every room she entered.

'She was the most positive, kind person I have ever met, who loved her boys and most definitely made an impact on everyone she ever met.'

Karen, who worked for a blinds and shutters company before her illness, had her funeral at Christ Church in Old Town, Swindon, Wiltshire, last week.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer last June following a mammogram. She didn't have a lump - instead she had an enlarged breast.

Despite her illness, she dedicated time to charity work, raising more than £2,000 for the Breast Cancer Unit at the Great Western Hospital.

Through the months of chemotherapy and invasive treatment, Karen kept a brave face and rarely allowed herself to shed any tears.

But tragically, the cancer spread to her spinal fluid and brain and, in December, she was given the devastating news the condition was terminal.

Karen passed away at Prospect Hospice on February 4, leaving behind her two sons Harry, 19, and Eddie, 15, and husband Alan.

Reverend Captain Clive Deverell paid tribute to the fun-loving mum during Friday's service.

He said: 'She loved being with her friends and families and she had great friends.

'She was a loving mum to her two sons Harry and Eddie. And of course there was Costa, shopping, Costa, shopping and I forgot to say, Costa and shopping.

'She really liked getting herself ready and was always immaculate. If they were going to go on holiday and wanted to arrive on time, Alan's trick was to set all the clocks in the house one hour early.

'Her humour and her fortitude were impressive. She is making the baristas in heaven's lives rather difficult with her one-shot extra hot skinny lattes.'

More than 450 people went to her funeral, with 300 attending the wake.

Lynzi added: 'It looked more like a wedding than a wake, she would have loved it.'

Karen Lloyd's husband said today her friends nicknamed her 'Costa Karen' - but he called her 'Costa Lot'.

Alan,
 who works on offshore wind farms, was 80 miles off the coast of Germany
 when found out that his wife of 20 years was seriously ill.

He said: 'She was first class, so friendly and happy, I couldn't have asked for a better wife.

'She was nicknamed Costa Karen, although I called her Costa Lot. It's a very sad loss, we were married for 20 years. I am going to miss her like anything.

'The funeral was a celebration of her life and it is good to do it on a humourous side.

'When we asked the funeral directors for a Costa Coffee-themed coffin, they said "you what? We've never done one of those before". But they managed to do one for us.

'We went to Las Vegas for her 50th birthday and on one of the days we hired cars and went to the Grand Canyon.

'She
 said it was one of the best days of her life and we said we would go 
back again one day. That's why she went out to Viva Las Vegas.'

A Costa spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are of course with the family at this difficult time.

'Clearly she enjoyed her Costa coffee and her family felt it was an appropriate addition to their farewell to her.'
