It was just over a year ago this week that David Moyes and Manchester United finally decided they had perhaps had enough of Wilfried Zaha. When the talented but unreliable young winger turned up 45 minutes late for a reserve game at Salford, the reigning Barclays Premier League champions chose to move him on.

It was not the first time Zaha had erred in this way and it was not just at Old Trafford where he could not be relied upon. He had been known to keep people waiting for hours to see him at his house, too. Over time, things like this get you a reputation that is hard to shake.

Take this anecdote from one Barclays Premier League manager from last January's transfer window. Linked with a loan move for Zaha, I asked him what his intentions were.

Wilfired Zaha completed a permanent move back to Crystal Palace on Monday

Appearances

Premier League - 0 (2 as sub), 28 minutes

FA Cup - 0 (0)

League Cup - 1 (0), 78 minutes

Champions League - 0 (0) 

Community Shield - 1 (0), 61 minutes

'Yeah I was looking at it,' he said candidly.

'But I know one of the backroom staff at United and they have told me not to go near him.

'They say he is good enough but he isn't doing things right.'

That final sentence perhaps sums up Zaha's short career at Old Trafford. Certainly he is talented. He has played for England and will now continue his career as a Barclays Premier League player with Crystal Palace.

But Zaha's application and attitude – at least among last season's management set-up at United – was never considered to be right. He played 22 minutes against Newcastle and six against Aston Villa in the Premier League before heading to Cardiff.

How relevant things like time keeping are to what happens on a football field depends on your point of view. However, the prevalent view among most at the top level these days is that if you can't get the small things right then what chance have you with the big things?

And when members of your own club are privately warning friends in the game not to touch you then it's time to accept you have some issues to address. 

Certainly when Sir Alex Ferguson signed him for £10million from Palace two years ago, eyebrows were raised throughout the game. Then just 20, the gifted forward had already earned something of a mixed reputation, depending on who you talked to.

Ferguson, for sure, would have backed himself to fix him. But, then, Ferguson wasn't sticking around beyond the season's end so why sign him and leave him for somebody else to handle?

That is one of the more peculiar – and unanswerable – parts of the whole affair. For Moyes, it was a hospital pass and one that Ferguson's replacement soon realised he had little interest in taking.

Short of players because of injuries, Moyes used Zaha on a pre-season tour of Australia and Asia in 2013 and the new signing impressed. 

But the environs of a summer tour are far removed from the reality of daily life at a Premier League club and – once he saw him on the training ground regularly – Moyes began to realise he wasn't for him.

Senior United players didn't disagree, either. Players like Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Ryan Giggs questioned much of what went on during Moyes' brief spell at the club but there were precious few dissenting voices when it came to the distance the United manager put between Zaha and the first-team picture.

There were other niggling issues, too. Zaha and Moyes fell out over the business of the player's company car, for example, something that still hadn't been resolved at the time Zaha eventually moved to Cardiff on loan this time last year.

From his point of view, Zaha felt he was never given a chance at Old Trafford. Speaking on last summer's tour of America, he vowed to do all he could to impress current manager Louis van Gaal. He was reluctant to criticise Moyes and deserves credit for that.

Zaha has been rejuvenated since Alan Pardew's appointment as Palace manager in December

Zaha was loaned out to Cardiff last January after failing to make an impact at United

Ultimately, though, Zaha's chance of establishing himself as a Manchester United player has now gone. Maybe it just came too soon for him. Maybe Moyes was just the wrong manager but now Van Gaal has passed similar judgement.

Zaha's form and application has by all accounts been good while on loan at Palace this season. Maybe a lesson has been learned. At Old Trafford, though, he will forever be consigned to a list labelled 'mistake'.
