A mother and father will stand trial for child abuse after two of their children were found bound and blindfolded in a Walmart parking lot, a practice the couple claimed was to guard against demons.

Adolfo Gomez, 52, and his 44-year-old wife Deborah were jailed on June 13 when police
found two of their children - a boy, five, and his seven-year-old sister - tied up and with duct 
tape over their eyes outside a Walmart in Lawrence, Kansas.

Both will be tried on two counts on child abuse, Douglas County Judge Paula Martin ruled on Tuesday. Mr Gomez faces an additional count of obstruction for resisting arrest.

The Gomezs' three other children, aged 12, 13 and 15, were in the family's SUV unrestrained. All the children are now in protective custody.

Five other charges of aggravated endangerment were due to be refiled by the district attorney before the couple's arraignment. The Gomezs next appear in court on Thursday.

The pair sat in 
court on Tuesday in orange jail pants and T-shirts and appeared to be 
listening intently to the testimony.

Police Detective Randy Glidewell 
testified that when he interviewed Adolfo Gomez on the day of hisÂ  arrest, the father said he had been listening to an online preacher
who was predicting the end of the world and that a 'darkness had come 
over the house' where the family lived in Northlake, Illinois.

'And the world was coming to an end, and that's why they left,' Glidewell added, referring to the father's comments.

The detective also said Adolfo Gomez 
told him he hadn't slept in nine days, and that Gomez was particularly 
concerned about one of the younger children.

Gomez described the child as 'acting like he was possessed'.

'He was scared (the child) would hurt some of the kids,' the detective added.

Lawrence police officer Hayden Fowler
also testified that one of the older children told him there were 'demons' in their Northlake home and outside their 
SUV in the parking lot, and that the coverings on the vehicle's windows 
were there to keep the demons out.

Adolfo Gomez's lawyer, Skip Griffy, 
said during the hearing that blindfolding and binding the younger 
children was part of the family's religious beliefs, and that it was not
done frequently or as a punishment but as a way to protect the children
from demons.

Mr Griffy said: 'Their actions were taken out of their religious beliefs, that these children were possessed.'

He added that the children had no injuries.

Angela Keck, a lawyer for Deborah 
Gomez, distanced her client from Adolfo Gomez, saying the woman had no 
control over her husband.

Ms Keck said: 'She was doing her best
to protect herself and her children when Mr Gomez was having a kind of 
religious experience. You have not heard anything that these children's 
lives were in any danger in any way.'

However Debby Moody, assistant Douglas County district attorney said that the 'danger to these children was real'.

She said: 'These types of bindings and blindfolds come into play when you're talking about ... prisoners of war.'

Deborah Gomez was involved in the 
abuse and when presented with an opportunity to help, 'she went shopping
for duct tape, two tarps and a baseball bat'.

These were the items police discovered in the mother's shopping cart at Walmart when the children were found.

The prosecutor described the tying up of the children as a 'team effort'.

Officer Fowler told the court that the couple's eldest daughter told him that their parents believed her younger siblings and their home was possessed by demons.

The child also said  the family had 
recently watched online videos about demons and 'a fallen angel'.

The older daughter said they were 
going to attempt to cast the demons out the younger children but did not
say how they planned to do that.

He said the daughter told him 'if the demons were to die (the children) would die also'.

The family had been 
traveling from Illinois to see a family member in Arizona when their SUV
broke down on Interstate 70.

They stopped in Lawrence and
were in the Walmart parking lot when Linda Baranski, 64, called the 
police after seeing one of the bound children outside the vehicle in the
store's parking lot.

During Tuesday's hearing, Ms Baranski 
testified that she noticed the child when she pulled her car into the 
parking lot.

She said the child was sitting 'flat on the cement, and 
they were bound and I thought gagged, and they were rocking back and 
forth'.

'I thought it might have been some sort of abduction,' Baranski said during her testimony.

Baranski said Adolfo Gomez then caught her eye and appeared angry when he motioned for her to leave.

'He motioned in a kind of angry way 
as if to say get out of here,' Baranski said. She said she then pulled 
into a parking spot and called the police.

Mr Gomez was standing near the vehicle when an officer approached it in response to Baranski's 911 call.

'When (the man) saw the officer, he tried to get away from him,' Lawrence police spokesman Sgt. Trent McKinley said.

The
man ducked inside the vehicle and the officer, concerned that the man 
could be reaching for a weapon, used a stun gun and put him in 
handcuffs, McKinley said.

The Gomezs had previously been 
charged with child endangerment in 1998 for leaving the two children 
they had at the time, aged one and two, alone in their Naperville, 
Illinois apartment for up to eight hours as they worked at night.

An official at the time said the case was 'among most severe cases of neglect I've seen since I've been on the job'.

Deborah
Gomez, who had pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor, ran into legal 
problems in 2001 for failing to take part in parenting counseling as 
part of the condition of her guilty plea.

Meanwhile, Adolfo Gomez has been arrested for several crimes, including three cases of driving while intoxicated.

He also spent time in prison on theft and burglary charges in the 1980s.
