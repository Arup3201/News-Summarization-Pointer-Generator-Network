It is good news for wine lovers on a budget as British supermarket champagne came out top in an international blind taste test.

Two £20 bottles of champagne from the Co-op and Asda have beaten rivals such as the £135 2005 Cuvee Amour De Deutz to win a 
prestigious award in the annual wine 'Oscars'.

The Co-op £19.99 Les Pioneers champagne and Asda’s £19.75 Extra Special Premier Cru Champagne won coveted Gold Medals in the IWC (International
Wine Challenge) awards.

Medals are given to the very best wines, regardless of price, after blind taste testing by an international panel of experts.

That means they could be giving out a Gold Medal - the highest accolade -
to a supermarket wine costing less than a tenner or to an expensive 
bottle of rare burgundy.

The supermarket chain celebrated by 
reducing the price of the non vintage bubbly to £16.99 for a limited 
period until June 4th.

The cut-price champers are named Les Pionniers after the Lancs town
'pioneers' who founded the Co-operative Society 165 years ago.

Ben Cahill, Co-operative Champagne buyer, said: 'Our Champagnes have 
knocked spots off the competition, reflecting our commitment to 
providing Co-operative shoppers with great-value, exceptional wines from
around the world. 

'We work hard to ensure the high quality of our wine range, and to have
our Champagnes recognised in this way is a fantastic seal of approval.'

A total of 32 Gold Medals were handed out to own brand wines from 
British supermarkets including a staggering 13 gongs to Marks and 
Spencer alone.

The award winning M&S range included everything from a posh £50 
Italian barolo red wine and a £25 vintage port to a £6.49 Marsala.

One of Tesco's five gold medals was for a £6.49 dessert wine while Sainsbury's picked up six Golds and Waitrose got five.

Of the 32 supermarket wine winners, 13 cost less than a tenner.

It was also a successful year for 
English Wine, as three sparkling wines and a sweet white wine won Gold 
Medals, and a further 19 wines won silver medals.

IWC chairman Charles Metcalfe said: 'We are thrilled with the success of our supermarket wines.

'Quality wine should be accessible as well as great value and these Gold
medal winners demonstrate how the supermarkets are reacting to the 
demands of the modern consumer.'

'More people are now choosing to spend a little extra on a wine which 
they drink at home, and supermarkets are reacting to that changing 
trend.

'In this time of austerity, consumers are looking for affordable quality
and supermarkets have definitely stepped up to the mark with their own 
brand ranges.'

The winning wines can advertise their Gold Medal success on their bottles which can be a major boost to sales.
