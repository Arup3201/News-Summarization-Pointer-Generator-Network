Highly paid energy bosses who are imposing above-inflation price increases on their customers can claim staff discounts on their power bills that save them around £150 a year.

Senior executives and managers at five of Britain’s six energy giants are entitled to cuts in their household fuel bills of up to 12 per cent while they impose increases of up to 9 per cent on consumers.

The millionaire chief executive of Scottish firm SSE, Ian Marchant, 51, is taking advantage of the staff discount. He claims a 12 per cent discount on the energy bill for his luxury home – estimated at £140 a year – despite receiving a £1.2million pay package.

Two other firms, EDF UK and npower, admitted their bosses were eligible but would not say if they had taken advantage of the scheme. 

Vincent de Rivaz, 58, the Frenchman who is chief executive of EDF UK, is eligible for a £48 discount on the cost of his household fuel and electricity bill while taking home £1.2million in pay and benefits.

Volker Beckers, Chief Executive of RWE npower has a pay package of £1m. He is entitled to £100 discount, but it is not known whether he has claimed it

Volker Beckers, the German who is chief executive of npower, is paid £1million in cash and benefits, and is entitled to vouchers worth £100 for buying his energy from the firm.

Executives at other energy firms have decided not to take up their staff discounts due to public anger at the size of the price increases.

The entire board of directors at British Gas’s parent company Centrica has agreed not to take the universal £200 staff discount on their energy bills this year.

E-ON chief executive Tony Cocker does not take the annual £150 ‘staff energy reward’ which is open to all employees. Scottish Power does not offer a staff discount.

Last night the energy fatcats were urged to give up the perks.

LibDem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘This is highly insensitive.

These energy bosses on £1million-plus packages really should do the right thing and follow their colleagues by giving up these discounts.

It is the least they can do when most people are struggling to pay the extra charges put on their energy bills by their firms.

‘These people are earning in excess of £1million but still they worry about clawing back a few pounds.’

Paul Green, spokesman for the older people’s organisation Saga, said: ‘These executives need to examine their consciences to see if it is right that they accept these discounts.’

Many families are already struggling to pay their energy bills amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes for more than 60 years. Millions of households will be forced to find an extra £100 on average to cover the cost of their heating and power bill following price increases of up to 9 per cent.

The rises have provoked anger as the wholesale price of electricity and gas has actually fallen over the past year.

Scottish Power has increased gas by 7 per cent and electricity by 6 per cent recently, while npower has increased gas by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent.

SSE has increased gas by 9 per cent and electricity by 9 per cent. British Gas has increased gas by 6 per cent and electricity by 6 per cent. E-ON has ruled out price rises until next year.

EDF has yet to announce its price rises.

Yesterday SSE boss Mr Marchant refused to discuss his 12 per cent staff discount but an SSE spokesman confirmed that he took it.

Standing at the marble-tiled entrance to his £1million home in Edinburgh, Mr Marchant said: ‘Please leave me in peace, I am trying to enjoy my Sunday lunch.’

He then shut the door.

EDF refused to deny that their millionaire boss Mr de Rivaz accepted the £48 staff discount offered to all employees.

A spokesman said: ‘All our employees are offered a fixed discount of £48 per year off their energy.’

Npower said it did not offer a staff discount on bills but did offer a loyalty scheme earning vouchers of up to £100 if their employees choose the firm as their electricity and gas provider.

A spokesman said all board members were entitled to join the scheme.

‘Whether they do so or whether they subsequently choose to donate them to a charity is a personal matter,’ he added.
