Increased awareness of SAD is causing many to incorrectly self-diagnose

Seasonal affective disorder - known as SAD - is a rare phenomenon that has been exaggerated, claims a new report.

A study of almost 800 people has shown neither time of year nor weather conditions greatly influence depressive symptoms in the majority of people.

Researchers believe the power of the ‘winter blues’ has been over-egged because of awareness of SAD - and a general dislike of the cold.

Dr David Kerr, of Oregon State University in the United States, said: 'We may not have as much fun, we can feel cooped up and we may be less active in the winter.

'But that’s not the same as long-lasting sadness hopelessness, and problems with appetite and sleep - real signs of clinical depression.'

His team compared data from U.S. citizens who completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms multiple times over a period of years with local weather conditions - including sunlight intensity.

Some 92 per cent of participants reported seasonal changes in mood and behaviour and 27 per cent said these were a problem.

However, Dr Jeff Shaman, of Columbia University, said: 'We found a very small effect during the winter months - but it was much more modest than would be expected if seasonal depression were as common as many people think it is.

'We were surprised. With a sample of nearly 800 people and very precise measures of the weather we expected to see a larger effect.'

The study, published online by the Journal of Affective Disorders, concluded getting depressed when it’s cold and dreary outside may not be as common as is often believed.

Dr Kerr said his findings do not rule out the existence of clinically diagnosed SAD but shows people may be overestimating the impact seasons have on depression in the general population.

He said: 'It’s clear from prior research SAD exists. But our research suggests what we often think of as the winter blues does not affect people nearly as much as we may think.'

Dr Kerr believes the misunderstanding could have arisen by most studies of seasonal depression asking people to look back on their feelings over time.

He said: 'People are really good at remembering certain events and information.

'But unfortunately we probably can’t accurately recall the timing of day-to-day emotions and symptoms across decades of our lives. These research methods are a problem.”

Dr Kerr said people who believe they have SAD should get help. He said clinical trials show cognitive behaviour therapy, anti-depressants and light box therapy can all help relieve both depression and SAD.

He said: 'Fortunately there are many effective treatments for depression - whether or not it is seasonal. Cognitive behaviour therapy stands out because it has been shown to keep SAD from returning the next year.'
