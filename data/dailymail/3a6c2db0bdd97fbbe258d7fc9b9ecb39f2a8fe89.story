Since her success on Monday night, the YouTube clip of her run went viral, garnering more than 6.5 million views as of Saturday morning. Her Twitter also received a flood of new followers, more than 30,000 since the show aired.

Her hashtag #MightyKacy took off, resulting in her trending on both Twitter and Facebook.

Her success on the course qualified her to compete in the show's national finals, which will take place in Las Vegas.

'American Ninja Warrior' is the American remake of 'Sasuke', a popular show in Japan in which contestants attempt to navigate a similar four-stage obstacle course.

The American remake began airing on the G4 network in 2007, then titled 'American Ninja Challenge.' NBC picked up the show in 2013. Reruns of the episodes aired on NBC are now being shown on the newly-relaunched Esquire Network.

Catanzaro, a 5-foot gymnast weighing 100 pounds, says that she intends to use her newfound Internet celebrity to spread a positive message of physical fitness to young women nationwide.

'It's nice to look good and have a great 
body, but you enjoy your life so much more if you are fit,' she said. 'That is the message I definitely want to get out.'

Catanzaro has been doing gymnastics for most of her life, and was a gymnast at Towson University, which prepared her to have the strength to overcome the challenge. She will need it when she arrives in Las Vegas for the national finals, in which contestants compete on the US version of Mount Midoriyama, the final course for 'Sasuke' also bearing that name.

While she made it look easy, Catanzaro did experience some trepidation while going through the Dallas course.

'The ring toss was something new this year and it was definitely a 
challenge, but I just took it slow and tried to stay calm,' she told People Magazine. 'When I missed
 the rung a few ties and swung out and I could hear the audience go, "Oh!"'

Despite the challenges, victory was sweet for Catanzaro.

'There’s really no ways to explain that feeling when you have this goal 
and you work so hard to get there and that moment of conquering it was 
just so amazing,' she told USA Today. 'I was just so happy to have done that for 
myself and all the other women that don’t think it’s possible to compete
 against [men] …'

As for what she plans to do in the future, Catanzaro said that she hopes to become a motivational speaker in school to encourage young people to be physically fit.

For now, Catanzaro competes on the NBC show in addition to 'Alpha Warrior', a similar style competition that tours the United States. Her boyfriend is also a contestant in both competitions.
