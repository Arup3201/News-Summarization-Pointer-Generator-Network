Whose clothes are you're lusting after this week? Kate Moss's coat? Cara Delevingne's cape? The Duchess of Cambridge's clutch? Or a pair of ankle boots worn by the girl sitting opposite you on the eastbound District line?

Well, lust no more. A team of technology whizz-kids at a company based at Imperial College, London, are developing a fashion-finding app enabling users to 'Shazam' outfits by taking photos of them, whereupon they will be shown a selection of options for buying the same or similar items.

The Find Similar service has been created by the team at Cortexica, a leading provider of visual search and image recognition technology for mobile devices, based in South Kensington.

Dress like a Duchess: A team of internet whizz-kids at a company based at Imperial College, London, are developing fashion-finding technology to enable users to dress like their idols

The technology allows you to find items of clothing that are similar in style to that which appears on your camera, meaning you no longer have to trawl the internet and play detective when you want to find out where Angelina got her dress or Claudia her scarf.

Cortexica spokesman Steve Semenzato told MailOnline: 'The company is four years old, and before that we did seven years of research at Imperial College. Agroup of Bio-engineers at Imperial figured out the technology.

'When we started the company we were doing a lot of work in the grocery sector, with companies like Tesco - technology that enabled you to take photos of items in your fridge and find the exact match online. But that was exact matches, and over the year we developed an evolution of that: find similar.'

The company soon realised that the best application for their new technology was fashion, 'because it's so difficult to describe items of clothing things in words and search for them on the internet'.

'But if you show someone a picture', continued Steve, 'you can see exactly what they're talking about.'

He continued: 'Where colour, pattern and texture are involved find similar is very good. So you can enter photographs of friends, celebrities, magazines, and the database will hunt for similar matches, and find the exact one if it's there.

'The bigger the database the better the matches, so we're currently talking to some very big retailers who have lots of images. And hopefully we'll be helping people.'

Like Cara's dress? The new technology will bring up options for similar dresses, most of which will be more within the budget of the average non-model

The Cortexia team - who describe themselves as 'the engine behind the scenes' - are taking their technology to people who run apps and websites where there might be an application for it.

They said: 'The application of this technology is set to revolutionise the online and mobile fashion marketplace.

'With
 it, retailers and major brand-owners are enabling their customers to 
start their individual searches for clothing or accessories - by just by
 taking a picture.'

They continued: 'Fashion is all about style, image and inspiration. Either from magazines pictures, street-style images, photos of friends' outfits or specific shop window styles you may see in the high street.

'Cortexica's Find Similar mobile image search gives you the opportunity to be inspired by what you see around you just by taking a picture and asking the system to find what you are looking for.

'Finding items couldn't be simpler, as traditional text based search or drop down category specific menu searches will never uncover what you are looking for.'

Cortexia's development follows rumours in April that Shazam - the British mobile phone music identification service - were developing a similar app.

A spokesman for Shazam told MailOnline: 'Shazam is not working on a new app for fashion. But, we currently have a merchandising feature incorporated in our television tag result - when you use Shazam to tag any show on 160 channels in the States, you can get information on the cast and show, including trivia, music in the broadcast, cast listing, etc. 

'Currently, that merchandising feature lets people buy show-related items, which sometimes includes clothing similar to that which is featured in the program. Our Executive Chair Andrew Fisher was referring to our plans to continue innovating around that feature, which is already in play.

'Having said that, fashion houses could quite easily work with Shazam to make their catwalk shows Shazam-enabled. 

'In fact, right after the clothes featured in catwalk shows, the music is the next thing that people talk about - and Shazam is frequently mentioned in Vogue, Garage and other top tier fashion magazines. 

'Fashion houses could partner with Shazam to incorporate information about their new line or other products so that when people use Shazam to tag the music in the show, they are able to browse the styles they see or view scents, accessories or other items.'

Listen up: Shazam have denied rumours they too are developing an app specifically for locating fashion items, though a version of the service is available in America via their TV 'tagging' function
