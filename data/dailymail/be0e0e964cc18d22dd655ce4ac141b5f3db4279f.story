A lawyer for the family of the black 18-year-old shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson has slammed the grand jury process as 'unfair' just hours before the anticipated verdict.

Seven men and five women have spent three months deliberating over evidence to decide whether to charge Wilson with the August 9 shooting that sparked violent protests across Ferugson, Missouri, and nationwide.

The conflicted suburb of St Louis, Missouri, is now bracing itself for outcry, with the deployment of the National Guard, grenade-armed police officers, and almost 100 FBI agents.

'Unfair': Benjamin Crump, attorney for Michael Brown's family, said the case should have gone straight to trial

And despite calls for calm from Michael Brown's mother and President Barack Obama, attorney Benjamin Crump has revealed the family does not trust the procedure, which could see Officer Wilson avoid trial.

'The process is completely unfair,' Crump told ABC News.

He added: 'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty.

'He would get every benefit of the doubt.

'I don't worry about the due process for officer Wilson. I worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground.'

His words come as authorities in Ferguson erect barricades around Buzz Westfall Justice Center, where the jury is expected to announce its verdict on Monday morning.

St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch called for a jury - made up of nine white and three black people to reflect the racial make up of the county - to decide whether Officer Wilson should be charged.

Anger: Crumps words came hours before the jury is expected to decide whether Wilson should be indicted

Outrage: The August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, 18, has sparked outrage across Ferguson and the nation

Tributes: Mourners paid tribute in the streets on Sunday during the tense wait for the jury to conclude

Following evidence from Officer Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether Wilson intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him.

Crump said: 'I just think this is process is unlike anything I've ever seen in my 20 years of practice. We don't think it's fair.

'If this prosecutor says ... we're not going to recommend any charges, that's different from anything he's done in his past 28 years with grand juries.'

He added: 'Why can't it be equal justice? Why can't we have the same process?'

Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge.

Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead.

Protests: Grenade-armed police have been deployed for fear of violent reactions to the jury's verdict

Conflict: Hundreds of people have been arrested since the unrest began almost four months ago 

Racial divides: Demonstrators have accused the county police force of racism in the majority black district

'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse.

'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder.

'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'

As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty.

Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'.

'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said.

Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, and President Obama has called for calm.

Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the announcement of the jury's verdict.
