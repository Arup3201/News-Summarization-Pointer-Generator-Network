A key ally of Ed Miliband provoked fury yesterday by blaming the ‘rhetoric’ of the Conservative Party for the brutal killing of a young Italian immigrant.

Hannes Swoboda claimed the anti-immigrant language used by government ministers ‘is now leading to murder in the streets of Britain’.

The Austrian, who is president of the Socialists and Democrats Group of MEPs in the European Parliament – which includes Britain’s Labour Party – was commenting on the killing of Joele Leotta.

Hannes Swoboda has been told to apologise, after being accused of politicising the murder of Italian waiter Joele Leotta in Kent

He also attempted to blame Ukip for 
the attack on the 20-year-old, who was beaten to death in Maidstone, 
Kent, last Sunday, only a few days after arriving in Britain.

Four
 men from Lithuania have been charged with his murder. A police officer 
investigating the attack told journalists at Medway Magistrates’ Court 
that it was not motivated by racial tensions or jobs.

Tory
 MEP Martin Callanan, who leads the Conservative group in Brussels, 
said: ‘To attribute blame for this tragic murder to the British 
government’s crackdown on illegal immigration is exceptionally low. 
Hannes Swoboda should apologise for politicising a tragedy.’

Senior
 Tory figures were mystified by Mr Swoboda’s remarks, which followed 
speculation in the Italian media that Mr Leotta’s attackers accused him 
of ‘stealing English jobs’.

Joele Leotta hoped that coming to the UK would help him improve his English

In
 a press release, he said: ‘The xenophobic, aggressive climate inflamed
 by populists such as Ukip and by the rhetoric of the Conservatives in 
government is now leading to murder in the streets of Britain.

‘Campaigns
 such as vans with slogans telling immigrants to “go home” and 
continuous negative rhetoric against foreigners – including EU citizens –
 are creating an ugly mood in Britain, which has long prided itself on 
being an open-minded and tolerant nation.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has written to Mr Swodoba demanding he withdraw the statement.

‘Hannes
 Swoboda is so blinded by hate against people who do not support this 
view of full political union in the EU that he levels accusations 
without checking the facts,’ he said.

‘In
 common with all decent and right-thinking people I am concerned, as 
should Mr Swoboda, with the rise of EU nationals committing crime in the
 UK.’

Under pressure to 
condemn Mr Swodoba, a Labour Party spokesman said: ‘These comments are 
deplorable and we do not support them. Hannes Swoboda does not speak for
 the Labour Party.’

Mr 
Leotta had come to the UK to improve his English and only arrived here 
on October 14. He was sharing a flat with a friend and had found a job 
in an Italian restaurant.

But
 on Sunday night a group of men are said to have kicked down the door to
 the flat before launching a savage attack on Mr Leotta and his friend.

Doctors were unable to save him, but his friend, Alex Galbiati is believed to be recovering in hospital.

Mr
 Swoboda is a senior ally of Mr Miliband and was invited to speak 
alongside the Labour leader at the party’s annual conference last year.
