Mike Brown hopes to begin a gradual return to training on Wednesday but England coach Stuart Lancaster insists he will not be rushed back following his horror head injury.

The England No 15 has experienced concussion symptoms since being knocked unconscious in an accidental collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi on Saturday. 

Brown is not allowed to start gentle exercise until he has been symptom-free for 24 hours.

Lancaster is optimistic he will start that six-day return-to-play process on Wednesday.

But in the light of the uproar surrounding George North’s double concussion and growing concerns around head injuries in rugby, Lancaster says doctors’ orders will be followed to the letter.

‘For me it’s always been the same,’ he said. ‘When I go back to my days as an academy manager you have to do what is right for the player first. 

'I don’t think any of the coaches I’ve ever worked with would ever do anything other than put the player at the centre and do what’s right for the player.

‘We are all far more aware and sensible in the sense they (the players) know their careers and their post-rugby careers are just as important as their current career.’

Ireland hooker Damien Varley has confirmed he is to retire from rugby due to a foot injury. 

The Munster forward, 31, suffered the injury two years ago and has made only one appearance this season - against Leinster in October.
