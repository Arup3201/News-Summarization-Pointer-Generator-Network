Rachel Yankey, the 33-year-old Arsenal Ladies midfielder, will today surpass Peter Shilton's record when she receives her 126th cap for playing for England in international games.

She will become England's most capped player of all time, among both men and women.

Playing for her country in Burton against Japan today - in England's penultimate match before July's Women's Euro 2013 in Sweden - Yankey will overtake the former England goalkeeper Shilton, 63.

Yankey has spent nearly 16 years 
representing England’s senior side since making her debut in a 4-0 win 
against Scotland in August 1997.

Speaking about equalising the record with Shilton's, she told MailOnline in April: 'To equal a record set by Peter Shilton, someone I grew up watching and was massive in the game, is just fantastic.

'To think I have played as many 11-a-side matches for my country as he did. I remember my debut, against Scotland in 1997. I got my first cap, I played up front and scored, so  I would have just been happy with that.'

When asked about any plans to retire, Yankey said: 'I don't know how long I will carry on. I still feel fit and healthy and I certainly don't feel my age. As long as I can make an impact and help the youngsters, I'll keep playing.

'They are going to be good players in the future, but if they come in and take my spot in the team they must be playing well.'

FA Chairman David Bernstein told MailOnline: 'I would like to congratulate Rachel on the magnificent achievement of winning her 126th cap, making her the most capped England player of all time in both men’s and women’s football.

'It is entirely fitting that she was made captain today against world champions Japan to commemorate such a landmark occasion.

'Since her England debut in 1997, Rachel has been a tremendous ambassador for her country on and off the pitch, and is rightly highly respected throughout the game at home and abroad.

'Of course, she shows no signs of slowing down and I wish her, Hope Powell and the squad all the best when England travel to the European Championship in Sweden next week.'

Speaking about equalising the record with Shilton's, she told MailOnline: 'To equal a record set by Peter Shilton, someone I grew up watching and was massive in the game, is just fantastic'

England teammate Jill Scott, who plays for Everton Ladies, said: 'We always give Rachel Yankey a bit of 
stick about her age because she's 33 and England's most-capped player, 
but she still plays like an 18-year-old with her speed and skills on the
ball.

'It was always going to take something special to beat Canada in the 
Cyprus Cup earlier this year and, sure enough, she delivered just that 
by scoring the winning goal. Her strike showed the most fantastic 
technique.'

Steph Houghton, who has played with 
Yankey for Arsenal and England and Team GB at last summer's Olympic 
Games, said of her team mate: 'Yanks is brilliant. I can’t praise her 
enough for the way she is on and off the pitch.

'She
leads by example and is one of the best players England has ever 
produced. To play with her for Arsenal and England is an honour for me 
and the rest of the girls.

'Off the pitch, she’ll have a quiet word with some of the younger girls and if you need any advice she’ll always be there.

'But
in other ways she’s the joker of the team as well, so a bit of the mix.
That’s just the personality that she has. She’s a great influence on a 
lot of people here (Arsenal) and at England.

'How long can she carry on? I think she’s the fittest she’s ever been. She’s looking so sharp in training.'
