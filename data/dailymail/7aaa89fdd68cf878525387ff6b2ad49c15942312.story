Cate Blanchett continued her successful tour of the awards circuit in the US over the weekend despite being drawn into the Woody Allen sex saga.

The 44-year-old actress wore an exquisite dress at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where she was awarded with the 2014 Outstanding Performer of the Year Award for her performance in Allen's Blue Jasmine.

The executive director of the Santa Barbara festival, Roger Durling, said: 'In her first collaboration with master director Woody Allen, Blanchett knocks it out of the park in the best performance of her already illustrious career.'We're so grateful to be able to celebrate her achievement.'

It came after Blanchett was named in an open letter posted by Allen's 28-year-old adopted daughter Dylan Farrow.

In the letter, posted in the New York Times on Saturday, she accused her adoptive father of sexually assaulting her when she was seven.

The letter also asked various actors who had worked with Woody - including Blanchett and Alec Baldwin - how they would feel if it was their child.

Cate - mother to Roman, nine, Ignatius, five and Dashiell, 12 - said she hopes Allen and the Farrow family can resolve their situation privately.

She told journalist Jeffrey Wells: 'It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace.'

Responding to a fan asking if he felt he should apologise to Dylan, Baldwin - who has daughters Ireland, 18, and Carmen, five months - wrote on Twitter: 'What the f&@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family's personal struggle?

'You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue.'

Woody - who was first alleged to have sexually assaulted Dylan in 1993 - has always maintained his innocence and never been prosecuted. He has yet to respond to Dylan's allegations.

Dylan was supported by her 26-year-old brother Ronan on Sunday who publicly stood beside her on Twitter.

'I love and support my sister and I think her words speak for themselves,' Ronan tweeted to his more than 200,000 followers on Twitter.

Lena Dunham, 27, of HBO's Girls praised Dylan for writing the open letter.

'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Lena tweeted on Sunday to her more than 1.3 million followers in a posting that included a link to the letter in the New York Times.

Woody's publicist Leslee Dart on Sunday released a statement from the director denying Dylan's accusation.'Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful,' the statement said.

In Blue Jasmine, Blanchett portrays a deeply troubled New York socialite who arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister.

After already sweeping up best actress accolades at the SAG Awards, Critics' Choice Awards, and Golden Globes, Cate is now predicted to win an Oscar for her performance, though she has some stiff competition.

She is competing for Best Actress in a Leading Role against Amy Adams in American Hustle, Sandra Bullock in Gravity, Judi Dench in Philomena, and Meryl Streep in August: Osage County.

The Academy Awards will be held on March 2.Â 

Cate Blanchett's performance in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine has been lavishly praised, but could Dylan Farrow's letter derail her chances?

It may seem that an 21-year-old alleged crime should have no bearing on Blanchett's 2014 Oscars, but being called out over the issue may make voters think twice before casting their ballots.

Farrow concluded her open letter by singling out stars who have starred in Allen's films, including Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett.

'What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett?' she asked.

Blanchett has been tight-lipped on the issue but addressed it last night, saying to journalist Jeffrey Wells, 'It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some sort of resolution and peace.'

If Blue Jasmine picks up any of the three awards for which it is nominated, is the Academy complicit in the alleged abuse by feting Allen and ignoring his crimes?

Allen's guilt is currently being tried in the court of public opinion, and it's unclear whether the Academy will take a stand.

So far, Blanchett has won the best actress award at the Critics Choice, Golden Globe, SAG, New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics awards.
