New York financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost two-thirds of its employees in the September 11 attacks, revealed a $135 million settlement with American Airlines and insurance carriers on Tuesday to a judge who said it will end the final airplane-focused case resulting from claims of wrongful death and personal injuries.

The original lawsuit, filed in 2004, was seeking $1 billion in damages.

Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into its top-floor offices in the World Trade Center's North Tower and claimed the airline had been negligent in allowing the terrorists to board the plane.

This weeks agreement averts a trial scheduled for next month, which means there will be no airing of such questions as how terrorists got through security before hijacking planes on September 11, the best way to stop terrorists, whether there was any real wrongdoing and negligence and how best to preserve liberties amid such threats, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said.

'All this will remain a mystery,' he said.

Howard Lutnick - the head of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald who lost 658 employees, including in his brother, in the 9/11 attacks - visits the North Pool of the Memorial during the 10th anniversary of September 11 in 2011. Cantor Fitzgerald this week settled a damages lawsuit with American Airlines for $135 million

Calling the settlement a significant conclusion after 12 years of litigation that resulted in scores of settlements and no trial involving airlines, the judge said: 'Hopefully what was achieved was a measure of justice, a measure of reparation and closure.'

'But the lives that were lost were irreparable, and being irreparable, there now are no words to describe that loss,' he added.

The deal was announced by Cantor Fitzgerald attorney John Stoviak, who said money from various insurers is in escrow and ready to be paid out pending formal approval by the court at or after a January 13 hearing.

Afterward, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard W. Lutnick said in a statement that the case for insurance companies 'was just another case, just another settlement, but not for us'.

Lutnick, whose brother Gary Lutnick was killed in the attacks, added: 'We could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.'

American Airlines Flight 11 was a passenger flight that was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists. It was the first plane flown into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2011, crashing into the Northern Tower, which held the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald

Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 of 1,000 people in its New York workforce when the 101st through 105th floors of its One World Trade Center headquarters were destroyed when a hijacked airplane struck the tower.

- Left Boston's Logan Airport at 7.59am

- Destination was Los Angeles

- On board were a crew of 11 and 76 passengers

- Five terrorists hijacked the plane once it was in the air

- The hijackers flew the plane into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8.46am

Howard Lutnick wasn't in the office at the time.

Anthoula Katsimatides, who lost her brother John Katsimatides, a bonds broker, said she was 'disheartened' to hear the case had been settled instead of going to trial.

'It would have been nice to hold people accountable over issues including security,' she said.

But she wasn't upset with Cantor Fitzgerald.

'I'm so confident that they are always thinking about the best interests of their September 11 families ... there must have been a reason why they settled,' she said.

Of this being the last airplane-focused case and therefore ending the chance to bring these issues up in open court, she said she was disappointed, but 'I guess we just have to live with it'.

A spokesman for American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and is part of American Airlines Group Inc., said in a statement the airline had 'vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that American should have done what the government could not do: prevent the terrorist attacks'.

The spokesman, Sean Collins, also noted that 'the courageous crew members and passengers on Flight 77 and Flight 11 were all victims of the terrorist attacks'.

The judge praised lawyers on both sides, saying he once thought a deal was impossible.

He noted that some litigation from September 11, 2001, remains, including claims involving the trade center, developer Larry Silverstein, first responders and others.

Cantor Fitzgerald, meanwhile, has risen dramatically from a low of about 150 employees in the months after the attacks.

It now has 3,200 employees in New York and about 8,000 worldwide, including the employees of a spinoff, BGC Partners.

In total, almost 3,000 people died in the 9/11 attacks, including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes.
