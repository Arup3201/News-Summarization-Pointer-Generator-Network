There's nothing quite like that first crunch in a fresh, untouched layer of snow.

And whether its gathering snow balls or making snow angels, a white Christmas can bring out the playful side in many of us.

But it seems we're not the only ones who take pleasure in a snow day. 

A recent study found that playing in the snow is also the favourite past-time of small birds.

Researchers have long wondered by redpolls (left) in Maine burrow through snow (right). Now, one researcher from the University of Vermont claims it is simple because they want to have fun like the rest of us

Professor Bernd Heinrich at the University of Vermont spent two years watching a flock of about 150 redpolls.

Between November 2012 and the following February 2013, the birds created at least 252 cavities and short tunnels in the snow in Western Maine, according to a study published in Northeastern Naturalist. 

Professor Heinrich told the New Scientist that he had always wondered why these birds dug small tunnels and trenches when there was no food burned beneath the snow.

The birds didn't require any shelter, and they were also unlikely to be bathing, as they were already clean.

Family fun: The scientists said that when one bird tunnels with gusto, all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too, suggesting it is a social activity. Pictured are example of redpoll tunnels

Instead, he came to the conclusion that the birds were simply enjoying playing in the snow.

He added that when one bird tunnels with gusto, all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too, suggesting it is a social activity.

'Play is defined as behaviour with no immediate function, so in that sense, yes, it is 'just' play,' Professor Heinrich continued.

He said that the playful behaviour may have its roots in birds farther north who tunnel to stay warm in insulated pockets of snow in the Arctic tundra.

In the Artic, the snow rarely thaws, but in Maine, it can develop an icy crust.

Professor Heinrich noted that redpolls in Maine do not burrow at night, suggesting they do not need it to keep warm.

Golden-winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern Tennessee were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm

Two days before a storm hit Tennessee that spawned 84 tornadoes and killed 35 people earlier this year, there was a mass exodus of birds. 

Golden-winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern Tennessee were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm.

And the discovery was made by accident while researchers were testing whether the warblers - which weigh less than two small coins - could carry geolocators on their backs.

It turned out they could. With a big storm brewing, the birds were seen taking off from their breeding ground, where they had only just arrived, as part of an unplanned migratory event.

The birds were alerted when the storm was 560 miles (900km) away, causing them to flee to Cuba before making the return trip once the storm had passed.

Overall, the warblers travelled 930 miles (1,500 km) in just five days to avoid the deadly storms.
