Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse has been charged with violent conduct by the Football Association.

The Senegal forward appeared to elbow Everton defender Seamus Coleman during United's 3-2 victory on Sunday, in which he scored his ninth of the season.

A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has been charged with violent conduct following an incident in the Magpies' Barclays Premier League fixture against Everton.

The Everton full back was visibly angry at Cisse's act of violence during Sunday's Premier League match

'Cisse was involved in an incident involving Everton's Seamus Coleman during the 3-2 victory at St. James' Park on Sunday, 28th December.

'Cisse has until 6pm on Tuesday (30th December) to respond to the charge.'

The FA's official statement on their website added: 'Newcastle United's Papiss Cisse has been charged with violent conduct by The FA. 

'This follows an incident during the Premier League game with Everton at St. James' Park on Sunday 28 December.

'The incident was not seen by the match officials but was reviewed on match footage by a video review panel.

'The charge carries a three game suspension. The player has until 6pm on Tuesday 30 December to respond to the charge.'

If he accepts the charge, Cisse would miss the home match against Burnley on New Year's Day, the FA Cup third round trip to Leicester at the weekend, and then the visit to top-of-the-table Chelsea on January 10.

After Sunday's match Everton boss Roberto Martinez insisted Cisse should have been sent off for the 'unacceptable' incident - especially as the striker went on to score.

Martinez said: 'It is unacceptable, that action from Papiss Cisse.

'You don't want to see that on a football pitch, that shouldn't be allowed. 

'Two players fighting for their position at a dead-ball situation and you end up deciding to take the law [into your own hands] by elbowing a fellow professional, it's unacceptable and that should have been a red card.'
