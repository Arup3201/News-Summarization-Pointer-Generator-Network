Time is running out for 18 miners trapped underground after a coal mine collapsed in southern Turkey on Tuesday. 

Governor Murat Koca said the incident occurred at the Has Sekerler mine near the town of Ermenek in Karaman province, 300 miles south of Ankara close to Turkey's Mediterranean coast. 

A rescue team has been working all night and into Wednesday to free the trapped miners, who are believed to be located about 350 meters below ground.

Turkish officials say the workers' chances of survival are slim unless they managed to reach a safety gallery.

The flood occurred around 3pm local time when workers were eating their lunch, Kerim Pinarli, one of 16 miners who was able to escape, told NTV news channel.

'We smelled gas and heard our friends below shout, "There's gas, don't come!" We escaped by seconds,' Pinarli said. 

Mr Koca said the miners were trapped after water accumulated inside the mine and flooded a gallery where they were working.

Turkey's emergency management agency, AFAD, said a broken pipe in the mine caused the flooding.

Emergency: Rescue workers attempt to pump water from the collapsed mine which has trapped the miners

Sahin Uyar, an official at the privately-owned coal mine, told NTV television the miners were stuck about 300 metres underground.

'At the moment, 18 of our colleagues are trapped. We are working to pump water out from three sections of the mine,' he told NTV, adding that so far rescue crews have had no contact with the trapped miners.

He said the trapped workers' chances of survival were slim unless they had managed to reach a safety gallery.

Turkey's ministers for energy and transportation are heading to the scene to oversee the rescue operation.

In May, a fire inside a coal mine in the western town of Soma killed 301 miners.

The fire exposed poor safety standards and superficial government inspections in many of the country's mines and led to more than two dozen arrests.

General manager Ramazan Dogru and operations manager Akin Celik were among the 24 detained five days after a fire ripped through the mine choking and incinerating workers.

The disaster sparked violent protests across Turkey, directed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit, and at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which is seen as too close to industry bosses.
