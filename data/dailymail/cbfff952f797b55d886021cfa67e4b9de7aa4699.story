A 32-year-old woman died and 19 others were injured when a scaffolding tower collapsed at a Linkin Park concert in South Africa, officials confirmed today.

Rescue teams said high winds caused the temporary scaffolding rig to topple onto a crowd as the American rockers prepared to go on stage last night in Cape Town.

Paramedics rushed around a dozen injured concert-goers to hospital after the accident, which happened at around 6.55pm at the Cape Town stadium.

towering structure to tilt over and collapse.

emergency services responded to the scene of the incident and found 20 
concert goers who had sustained various injuries.'

It has since been used for concerts and other large events including prayer meetings.

Linkin Park's Cape Town concert was one of two planned in South Africa, with the band due to play at Johannesburg's SoccerCity stadium on Saturday.
