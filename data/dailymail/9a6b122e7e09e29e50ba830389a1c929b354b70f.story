Tom Croft's World Cup prospects are in danger of being damaged by the uncertainty over his future at Leicester.

The 29-year-old was forced into the role of frustrated spectator on Sunday as the Tigers beat Bath in a feisty Aviva Premiership clash at Welford Road.

The veteran of 43 Tests and two Lions tours was in the stand while Jamie Gibson started at blindside flanker and Italian Robert Barbieri was preferred as the back-row replacement on the bench.

JAN 16, 2010: Ruled out of Six Nations after grade two medial ligament injury against Viadana.

NOV 27, 2010: Out for three months after fracturing right shoulder blade against South Africa.

APRIL 21, 2012: Eight-month absence after suffering triple fracture of C6 vertebra against Harlequins.

SEPT 11, 2013: Sidelined for rest of 2013-14 season after knee injury v Worcester.

OCT 10, 2014: Ruled out of autumn Test series with recurring knee problem.

After the game, Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill confirmed that Croft had been left out of the match-day 23, rather than being unavailable due to yet another injury, saying: ‘He was fit — not selected.’

So far this season, Croft has made only three appearances for the Tigers — partly due to a knee problem and partly due to the strides made by Gibson, who has excelled in his position. 

He only played twice in the previous campaign, which was cut short by a serious knee injury. The year before that, he was ruled out for several months after breaking his neck — a frightening setback which required major surgery.

Croft is out of contract in the summer and his hopes of staying at the club where he has played throughout his professional career are in the balance.

Cockerill said: ‘He needs to play. He’s only played five games in two years so he needs to play. It (non-selection against Bath) was just about fitness — as in, he’s not played.’

Asked if he really wanted the athletic forward to stay, Cockerill responded with a resounding ‘Yes’, but it is understood the sticking point is Leicester’s insistence that he accepts reduced terms on any new deal. Their logic is understandable in the circumstances, but it has created a stand-off.

It is unclear whether other clubs have made enquiries about Croft.

The implications for England are stark. If Croft is short of game time at club level, he cannot be seriously considered for a recall.

He was a fixture in the first Six Nations campaign of Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach, in 2012 — delivering an astonishing, match-winning performance against France in Paris — but has not represented his country since the record defeat in Cardiff in March 2013.

Months later, he made two Test appearances for the Lions, but since then his international career has been on hold.

Leicester were able to confirm yesterday that Owen Williams has signed a new contract which will keep him at Welford Road for a further two years.

The 22-year-old fly-half has rejected the option of a return to the Scarlets.

His decision is another blow to the Welsh region, who will lose Wales stand-off Rhys Priestland at the end of the season. He has opted to join Bath — where he will largely serve as understudy to George Ford — for a salary thought to be around £300,000 per year. 

This is likely to spell an end to his Test career, at least in the short term, as the so-called ‘Gatland’s Law’ against picking players based abroad is due to be more strictly enforced.

Another Welshman who will be on the move in the summer is Gavin Henson. The veteran utility back has been a bit-part figure at Bath. 

While Sportsmail has learned there has been interest from France and Japan, it is understood the 32-year-old is more likely to stay in England, with Bristol keen to recruit him.

Reports in France suggest Bath are trying to sign All Black back row Jerome Kaino.
