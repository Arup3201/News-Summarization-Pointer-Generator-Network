When Jeannie Crutchfield learned that her 14-year-old daughter had ditched class, she decided to punish her in a way the girl would truly feel: by humiliating her on Facebook.

With her cell phone recording, the angry mother turned up to her daughter Ricki's school in Casper, Wyoming last week to confront her about playing hooky and then following her to class.

And once Ricki conceded that her mother was right, Crutchfield uploaded the video to Facebook - and Ricki and her siblings vowed never to defy their mother again. 

The video, which Crutchfield shared to her Facebook page, shows her approaching Ricki outside the school as she walks to class.

'When was I ditching, mom?' the teenager asks.

'Every day this week,' her mother responds. 'We're going to hold hands and we're going to go to class together. Isn't it great?'

As Ricki refuses to respond to her and storms ahead to class, Crutchfield trails her. 

'What's wrong?' she says. 'You don't want everyone to know why I'm here? You thought it was cute to dicth with your friends... Now let's see how cute you think is to hang out with mom during class.' 

Humiliating: Other students look on as Crutchfield follows her daughter through the school on the video

Accepting: Ricki eventually stops arguing with her mother and has been at every class since

Finally she corners the girl at a water fountain and Ricki insists she had only ever been out of class to see the nurse - which her mother says is not the truth. 

'This is what happens when Ricki can't act right,' her mother said as the girl fell quiet. 'Her mom needs to come to the school and record her to get it through her head. I warned you didn't I?'

After Crutchfield shared the video to Facebook, it has been viewed more than 32,000 times.

But more importantly to the working single mom-of-three, her daughter's school attendance has been perfect, she told ABC News.

'As a single mom, I learned that I have to do double the work. I learned to improvise when it comes to my parenting,' she told ABC. 

Thankful: Ricki, pictured with her mother right, said she is grateful that her mother cares so much about her, while Crutchfield said that, as a single mother of three, sometimes she has to improvise

'Her attitude has changed. She was asked [by a friend] if she wanted to ditch school yesterday, and she told the person no. The thought of mom following her again wasn’t appealing.'

Even though some viewers called the treatment cruel, Ricki took it well.

'It just goes to show that my mom cares,' Ricki told KTWO. 

Crutchfield's other two children also found the video funny. 

'As far as my youngest, she says she will never skip school ever,' Crutchfield said.
