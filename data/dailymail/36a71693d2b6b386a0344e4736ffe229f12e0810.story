A former para-educator from Vermont has been accused of using Facebook to send sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old student and allowing him to sleep at her home.

Investigators would not say if the two had sex during the boy's stay.

Tiffany Pagan, 25, worked at an alternative education facility in Rutland. On Wednesday, she was charged with one count of child luring.

Police said they began investigating the Clarendon resident in July after the Department for Children and Families in Rutland received a complaint about her conduct.

Rutland City Public Schools Assistant Superintendent Rob Bliss told the Burlington Free Press Pagan worked for less than a full school year at the Allen Street Campus - an alternative school for children in grades 6-12 who require structured learning and support due to emotional difficulties.

Ms Pagan mentored the 15-year-old student attending the institution, previously known as the Success School.

The Vermont Department for Children and Families contacted state police July 2 to report a possible sexual relationship between the para-educator and the teenager. 

Tiffany Pagan is scheduled to appear in court on October 20.
