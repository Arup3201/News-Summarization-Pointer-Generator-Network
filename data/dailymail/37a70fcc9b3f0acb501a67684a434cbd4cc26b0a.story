Frankie Dettori landed his 11th Breeders’ Cup victory on Friday when winning the Juvenile Turf on Wesley Ward’s Hootenanny.

The 6-1 shot was adding to his victory in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in June.

European hopes of a victory in the first race of the two-day Breeders’ Cup programme had been high with four runners, including well-backed Aidan O’ Brien-trained War Envoy, who faded into 12th of the 14 runners.

Charlie Hills-trained Commemorative was seventh, Charlie Fellowes-trained Wet Sail last and the best they could muster was fifth from Brian Meehan’s fast-finishing Faithful Creek under Kieren Fallon.

Dettori always had Coolmore Stud-owned Hootenanny well placed just behind front-running eventual second Luck Of the Kitten and he hauled that rival back with a strong run in the home stretch.

It was a fourth Group One win of the year for Dettori, whose future looked bleak when he split with Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation. He has, however, flourished under new boss Sheik Joaan and also formed an occasional and lucrative trans-atlantic link with Ward.

The jockey said: ‘It’s the greatest comeback since Frank Sinatra.’

On his victory Dettori added: ‘There was a strong pace and I got him to switch off. He didn’t corner well and lost momentum on the bends but when he got to the stretch he flew.’

Trainer Ward was not at Santa Anita in California to witness his first Breeders’ Cup win having stayed in Florida to watch his son compete in a cross-country event.

Hootenanny has made two trips to Europe this year having also finished second to the Dettori-ridden The Wow Signal in the Group One Prix Morny at Deauville.

Asked if the colt could return to Europe to contest a Classic, Coolmore partner Michael Tabor said: ‘Why not, we are optimists.’

Dettori later finished third on Richard Hannon’s Osaila in the Juvenile Fillies Turf won by Lady Eli.

Osaila struggled to get a clear run on the home turn but never looked likely lay down a threat.

The Dirt Mile was won for the second consecutive year by Goldencents, who burnt off his rivals with a lung-bursting front-running effort under jockey Rafael Bejarano.

Goldencents is trained by Leandro Mora after bein transferred to his care because 2013 trainer Doug O'Neill is serving a drug-related suspension.
