The sister of a Connecticut man who fatally shot his teenage son last week frantically called police to report someone was shot after she called her brother for help with someone trying to break into her house, according to 911 calls released on Friday.

Police say Jeffrey Giuliano went outside with a gun at about 1 a.m. on Sept. 27 after his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door in New Fairfield. Authorities say Giuliano saw a person wearing a ski mask holding a shiny object come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him.

He was told later the person he killed was his 15-year-old son, Tyler. Police said the weapon was a knife.

Tyler Giuliano was shot dead by his father, police said, as he tried to break into his aunt's home

'Someone's been shot. They were trying to break into my house and I called my brother next door,' said Alexis Scocozza, Giuliano's sister, on the 911 recording.

Speaking rapidly and trying to catch her breath, she said she wasn't sure if her brother was shot.

'I don't know if he was shot or not,' the sister says.

'Does your brother have a gun?' the dispatcher asks.

'I think so,' she replies. 'But I opened the front door and he screamed for me to stay inside.'

Giuliano's wife also called police.

Gene Zingaro, Giuliano's attorney, said this week that Giuliano believed the masked person had a gun.

'What that tells me is she did not know if there was one or two guns,' Zingaro said, referring to Giuliano's sister. 'Mr. Giuliano as we all know felt like at the time of the shooting the masked intruder not only had a gun but that he was in imminent danger.'

The recordings show that 'probably five 
or six' calls came in to the dispatch center from people who heard 
'multiple' shots fired, and that the police arrived in a matter of 
minutes.

On another call, someone says it appeared the teen might have a gunshot wound to the head. Police have said Tyler died of multiple gunshot wounds.

Police are investigating the shooting. No charges have been filed and Zingaro said he doesn't expect any.

Devastated Jeffery Giuliano went outside with his gun at 1am after his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door in New Fairfield, about 50 miles from New York city.

He saw a masked person holding a knife come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him.

After calling the police Mr Giuliano 
began to fear it was his son he had shot, as the boy had been missing, but 
the terrible truth was not confirmed for several hours.

Mr Giuliano's attorney Gene Zingaro, 
who arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting, said Giuliano was 
inconsolable and physically ill - crying and vomiting.

Giuliano and his wife adopted Tyler 
and his sister about four years ago.

The children's biological father 
was heading to prison, and the children would have gone into an 
orphanage if the couple, who had three other children, had not adopted 
them, Zingaro said.

The father and son shared a love of 
music and the Civilian Air Patrol, in which Tyler served as a cadet and 
enjoyed flying gliders and small aircraft, Zingaro said.

Support: Visitors arrive at the home of Jeffrey Giuliano to offer their
support. The family's attorney said they remain utterly devastated and 
still struggling to comprehend what had happened

Investigation: A State Trooper emerges from the backyard of the Giuliano
home. Their attorney said he did not believe any charges would be 
brought against the family

Mr Zingaro said the family were 'not well' and were struggling to comprehend what had happened and were filled with questions.

He said: 'Their family is hurting. 
They've been broken in half by this unspeakable tragedy, which really is
three tragedies all in one.'

'The family has literally hundreds of 
questions as to what Tyler was doing, why he was wearing what he was and
why he was carrying what he was,' Zingaro said.

'Those questions will probably go unanswered forever.'

Giuliano and his wife cooperated 
immediately with authorities, allowing them to search their home without
a warrant and giving a sworn statement, Zingaro said. He called it a 
justifiable shooting and said Giuliano had a permit to carry the gun.

Mr Zingaro said he did not believe his client would be charged with any type of offense, weapon or otherwise.

State police said the shooting 
happened after Jeffrey Giuliano got a call from his sister next door 
saying that someone might be trying to break into her home in their 
neighborhood of attractive colonial-style houses.

'Giuliano grabbed a handgun and went outside to investigate, troopers said.

He confronted someone in a ski mask and opened fire when the person came at him with something shiny in his hand, police said.

'When police officers arrived, Tyler 
was lying dead in the driveway with a knife in his hand, and his father,
in a T-shirt and shorts, was sitting on the grass.

Detectives informed the devastated father several hours later that he had shot his son, Vance said.

Police were investigating whether the father's gun was registered.

State police say they are continuing to investigate the shooting. No charges have been filed.

Giuliano, affectionately known around 
Meeting House Hill School as Mr. G, grew up in New Fairfield, an hour's 
drive northwest of New Haven.

He holds summer music and zoology 
camps for his students and plays guitar in a local rock band that raises
money for charity, schools superintendent Alicia Roy said.

The family attended a memorial service for Tyler on Sunday night.

He was 'in a state of extreme anguish' and was 'utterly devastated,' Zingaro said.

'It's a loss that cannot be measured,' he said.

New Fairfield First Selectman John 
Hodge provided a statement that was read on behalf of the Giuliano 
family at the memorial service, thanking the community for its support.

'So many people have rallied behind this family in a way that touches our hearts and gives us strength,' the statement said.

One classmate said many students were baffled by what happened.

'I just thought it was so weird when I
heard because I knew Tyler, not very well, but he was just a sweet 
person and he always made everyone laugh. I met him in the chorus room, 
actually, and he just wasn't the type to do what happened,' said Erin 
Pallas, 16. 'So it didn't make sense to us. It doesn't make sense to the
student body.'

Police arrived at the aunt's New Fairfield property to find Tyler dead, his father distraught

New Fairfield High School, where Mr Giuliano taught and his son was a student, stayed open late to provide grief counseling for students and parents

Brett Rasile, a 14-year-old friend, 
said he and Tyler were playing an online game called Minecraft while 
talking and laughing together via Skype until about 10 p.m. Wednesday, 
when Tyler said he had to go to bed. Brett said Tyler wasn't in any 
trouble that he knew of, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

'Same old Tyler. He was perfectly fine,' Brett said. 'He didn't really leave any evidence, any hints towards what he would do.'

Alicia Roy, New Fairfield 
superintendent of schools, said the elder Giuliano grew up in the town, 
holds summer music and zoology camps for his students and plays guitar 
in a local rock band that raises money for charity. He is affectionately
known as 'Mr. G' around Meeting House Hill School.

'He was the teacher you requested in 
the fifth grade. He was a great teacher. All the kids loved him,' said 
Rosemary Rasile, Brett's mother.

Brian Wyckoff, 17, said Mr. G 'was always walking around with a smile on his face. He always says hi to everyone.'

The high school stayed open late to provide grief counseling for students and parents.

'The community is deeply saddened, and our hearts go out to all the family members,' Roy said.
