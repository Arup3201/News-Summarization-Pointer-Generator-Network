Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is emerging as a strong contender to fill Arsenal's defensive midfield role.

Arsene Wenger has had his eye on a new holding midfielder since the summer and, despite the fact he usually plays in an advanced role for Newcastle, Sissoko features highly on Arsenal's list of targets.

The Gunners have a budget of around £20million to spend next month and are prioritising a new defender when the transfer window reopens.

But the club's money-men are willing to stretch the budget in order to sign a defensive-minded midfielder too, and could stretch to as much as £16million for Sissoko.

Wenger has already admitted he is ready to spend if the right players become available.

Sissoko said earlier this month: 'I have ambition. My goal is to play at the best clubs, playing the Champions League, win trophies, but today I am a Magpie and I am very happy. 

'Arsenal were my favourite club when I was young and my idol was Patrick Vieira. I have always loved this club and I still love them.'

In addition to Sissoko, the Gunners are targeting a move for Ipswich Town defender Tyrone Mings.

But Ipswich's £10million valuation is proving a stumbling block towards a January deal.

Wenger, who has already admitted his interest in Mings, views the 21-year-old as a long-term central defender - even though he plays at left-back for Ipswich at the moment.

If the Gunners can negotiate a lower fee for Mings, then could afford Sissoko as well next month.
