A farmer who lost 810 acres of land during last winter's floods was refused £11,000 compensation - after being told these aerial pictures showed 'insufficient evidence' of the damage.

James Winslade was forced out of his farm in Bridgwater, Somerset and had to shift 550 cattle to safe havens after floodwater reached 12ft deep in some places.

The cattle farmer was entitled to government funding to reseed his fields, but officials told him he would need to provide evidence of the damage.

James Winslade lost 810 acres of land in Bridgwater, Somerset, during last winter's floods was refused £11,000 compensation because of 'insufficient evidence'

The cattle farmer was entitled to government funding to reseed his fields, but officials told him he would need to provide evidence of the damage

Mr Winslade sent a collection of aerial images showing his land under almost eight ft of water to highlight the damage caused during the bad weather.

But he was stunned when he received a response telling him the evidence he submitted was not sufficient to show his problems.

The payment only came after a Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs sent an inspector to the farm - almost six months later.

Mr Winslade, who became a figurehead during the flooding crisis, said: 'I think it could be far more simple. I know it's European money and that they need to be accountable to Europe but surely with every farm in and around Moorland that had been affected there should have been a far simpler system. 

He applied to the fund in April, and bought more than £11,000 worth of grass seed in May and June to start the regrowing process on his land 

During the Christmas and New Year flooding he had to shift 550 cattle from West Yeo Farm and Newhouse Farm in Moorland on the Somerset Levels

The beef producer hoped to be paid back in instalments after buying the seed, but officials said there was 'insufficient damage'  caused by the flooding

'They could have sent someone out to inspect, and said, right you have done the job here is the money.

'I put in all the photographs back in April to show the damage but they said the photographs weren't good enough and didn't prove I was flooded.

'I couldn't believe it. They were aerial photographs of my parents' farmhouse and my farmhouse and of the land. Of 840 acres 810 was flooded.'

He applied to the fund in April, and bought more than £11,000 worth of grass seed in May and June under a three-month payment plan.

The beef producer hoped to be paid back in instalments after buying the seed, but he only received the funding six months later.

Farming Minister George Eustice, defended the delay, saying officials did not have all the information needed at first to make the payment.

He said: 'We went the extra mile and sent a Defra official out and he has been paid now.

'This is public money it is coming out of a European fund and there are lots of rules about the way you monitor and apply European funds.' 

The payment only came after a Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs sent an inspector to the farm to assess the damage almost six months later

Mr Winslade said: 'I put in all the photographs back in April to show the damage but they said the photographs weren't good enough and didn't prove I was flooded'
