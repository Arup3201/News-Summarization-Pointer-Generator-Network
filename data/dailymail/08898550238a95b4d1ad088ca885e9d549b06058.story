With 12 Browning .303 machine guns and a maximum speed of 322mph, this Hurricane can certainly still pack a punch.

Now aviation enthusiasts will have a rare chance to bid on one of them, with the 70-year-old fighter aircraft from World War Two expected to go for £1.7million this December in Weybridge, Surrey.

The plane, built in 1942, was based in Canada during the war and is believed to have protected convoys on the East Coast from German U-boat activity - or used as a training aircraft.

Hurricanes were the Royal Air Force’s first monoplane fighters, made famous in World War Two’s Battle of Britain - during which they shot down more enemy aircraft than their partner, the Spitfire.

The restored Hurricane Mk XIIa 5711 half-ton plane, which is capable of a range of 900 miles, will form part of a sale at Mercedes-Benz World, home of the Brooklands racing circuit in Weybridge.

The plane - which is 32ft long, 13ft high and has a wingspan of 40ft - joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1943, before being struck off from the RCAF in 1947 and bought by a Canadian syndicate.

It was later restored, making its first post-restoration flight in 1989, then bought by the Historic Aircraft Collection in 2002 and housed at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.

The 'G-HURI' plane was fitted with the correct Merlin engine and it now flies as ‘Z5140’, with the code letters HA-C and in the Battle of Britain colours worn by a Hurricane IIB flown with 126 Squadron during the siege of Malta.

'This Hurricane is one of only a handful of these iconic aircraft still flying today, and is presented for sale in highly original condition'

During the Collection’s ownership it became the first Hurricane to return to Malta since World War Two.

This summer it was also the first to fly to Russia since the war, at the Moscow Airshow.

Brooklands, where the auction by Bonhams will take place in December, has its own history with the Hurricane plane - as it was assembled and first flown in prototype from there in 1935.
