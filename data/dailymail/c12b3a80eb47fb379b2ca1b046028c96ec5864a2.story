The Django Unchained actress who claimed she was harassed by LAPD officers who unfairly arrested her when she was making out with her boyfriend appears to have been doing a lot more than just kissing.

Pictures obtained by TMZ show Daniele Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof.

Eyewitness accounts suggest that Watts was grinding on top of her boyfriend with  her shirt pulled up and her breasts exposed.

An eyewitness who saw the couple as he worked in a nearby office told TMZ that Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth.

Someone from the office went down and asked the couple to stop because everyone in the office could see them but they continued.

The eyewitnesses said Lucas then began 'horizontally bongoing her boobs back and forth'. He added that Watts eventually reached into the center console, grabbed a tissue, wiped him down and then herself and tossed it on the grass.

Watts has insisted that she did nothing wrong before officers questioned and detained her - despite accounts from witnesses saying she and her partner were having sex in public. 

She claimed she was 'handcuffed and detained' by police after being mistaken for a prostitute as she kissed her white husband.

Meanwhile the Los Angeles police officer who detained her has spoken out to defend his actions and said he never suspected her of being a prostitute.

Sergeant Jim Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended to arrest Watts or her boyfriend Brian James Lucas when he was called to an LA studio parking lot for a report of two people have sex in a car.

'I figured I could take care of this call and go get coffee and that was it,' Sgt Parker told the newspaper.  

Instead, he says, Watts turned it into a 'long, drawn-out drama.' 

'I was trying to ID them and leave. Nobody wanted them arrested for having sex in public,' Sgt Parker told the Times. 

'But then she went into her tirade.'

In a police audio of the incident obtained by TMZ, Daniele Watts is heard accusing the police of racism when Sgt. Jim Parker asks her for ID. She then tells cops that they don't who she is before storming off, refusing to show her ID.

After storming off, Watts was apprehended by a police officer a short distance away and brought back where she continued her rant. 

In the audio, Sgt. Parker can be heard telling Watts that the police were responding to calls from a nearby office.

She says: 'I bet there's at least one person up there who's a racist. I bet you. I bet you're a little bit racist.'

After refusing to give her name, Watts demands to know Sgt. Parker’s first name, before adding: ‘I think I’d like to identify you to my publicist. What’s your first name?’

She continues: 'I guess we all have our destinies... I serve freedom and love. You guys serve detainment. That's cool.

'I hope you feel free... I hope when you're f***ing your spouses you really feel alive. That you feel thankful, full of gratitude for the freedom that you have, that you share with the people of this country.'  

Watts was stopped by police in Los Angeles last week after she was reported for kissing her boyfriend Brian Lucas (left). She claims police thought she was a prostitute

The actress played the role of house slave Coco Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film Django Unchained

Miss Watts told CNN that she stands by her decision not handing over her ID. 

'I believe what this country stands for and I believe in freedom and I believe in a country that calls itself the land of the free and the home of the brave,' she said on Monday. 

'If I am within my amendment rights, my constitutional rights to say no, unless you're charging me with a crime, I will not be giving you my ID, that is a right that I stand up for.' 

California law allows police to handcuff and detain people in order to identify them.

The LAPD says it is conducting a review of the incident. The department is also investigating a complaint Miss Watts filed against Sgt Parker. 

A recording of the encounter, obtained by the TMZ and the Times, shows Parker explaining: 'Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right to identify you by law.'

Watts responds: 'Do you know how many times I've been called, the cops have been called just for being black? Just because we're black and he's white? I'm just being really honest, sir.'

Sgt Parker replies: 'Who brought up the race card?'
