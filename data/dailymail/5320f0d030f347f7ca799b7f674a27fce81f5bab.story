President Barack Obama took a moment out of greeting the Red Sox to the White House on Tuesday to snap a selfie with player David Ortiz.

After Ortiz presented him with a Red Sox 
jersey emblazoned with 'Obama' and the number 44 on the back, Obama grinned beside the player as he took out a cell phone.

'What an honor! Thanks for the #selfie @BarackObama,' Ortiz tweeted quickly after.

As Obama welcomed the 2013 World Series champions, he praised their triumph on the field while hailing them as a symbol of their city's 'grit and resilience' in the wake of Boston's bombing last year.

Cheese! Ortiz shared the selfie on Twitter, adding: 'What an honor, thanks for the #selfie @BarackObama'

Standing in front of players and team officials, Obama noted that the Red Sox have won three championships in the past decade, more than any other team.

He said sports sometimes 'seems like it's trivial, it's just an entertainment. And then, every once in a while, you're reminded that sports represents something else and it has the power to bring people together like almost nothing else can'.

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured nearly a year ago in a bombing at the Boston Marathon.

The Red Sox staged a tribute to the victims on the field and had 'Boston Strong' symbols sewn into their uniforms.

Day trip: Ortiz also shared these images on Twitter of his visit to the White House on Tuesday, writing beneath the picture on the left, 'I love this country' and the image on the right: 'I could look at these all day'

'The point is, Boston and the Red Sox were one,' Obama said. 'With every game they played, the Sons of Fenway never forgot what it meant to wear the Boston uniform.

'When
 they visited bombing victims in the hospital, when they played ball 
with kids getting cancer treatment, when they started a program to help 
wounded warriors get treatment at Mass General (Hospital), these guys 
were saying, "we're all on the same team".'

Obama, a Chicago White Sox fan, wished Boston good luck this season, then added, 'May the best Sox win.'

But asked by ABC News which team he expects to welcome to the White House next year, Obama quipped: 'White Sox next year.'

As well as the selfie, one other 
highlight of the visit came from outfielder Jonny Gomes, who strolled 
the White House grounds dressed in a sports jacket that looked like an 
American flag, stars on one half, and stripes on the other.

Gomes later told reporters that the president 'approved' of his blazer.

'He made sure to tell me he liked it,' he said. 'Iâ€™m just a pretty patriotic person.'

The Red Sox visited wounded veterans at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center after leaving the White House.
