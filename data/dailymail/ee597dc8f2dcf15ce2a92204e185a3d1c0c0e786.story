Francois Hollande's affair with the actress Julie Gayet appears to be over after she was seen on holiday with another man and he went off on a break alone, it was claimed today.

Reports of a split follow months of speculation over the personal life of France's bachelor president since he dumped his live-in-girlfriend in January.

Valerie Trierweiler, 49, had to leave the Elysee Palace when Mr Hollande’s secret affair with Miss Gayet, a 42-year-old actress, was made public.

But now it appears Miss Gayet, who kept a low profile ever since, refusing to even acknowledge she is seeing the head of state, has moved on. 

In pictures published in Voici, a glossy magazine, she was photographed on a beach in Corsica with another man, believed to be finance management lawyer Pierre Puybasset.

The magazine said the actress stayed five days before returning to Paris. Ms Gayet had enjoyed a 'holiday of love' on the Mediterranean island, according to Atlantico, a news website. 

Meanwhile, Mr Hollande is spending ten days in La Lanterne, an 18th-century residence made available to presidents and prime ministers in Versailles, outside Paris.

French media reports had claimed last month that Mr Hollande was preparing to marry his mistress next week on his 60th birthday.

The rumours intensified on July 14, Bastille Day, when Mr Hollande was asked directly about his private life in a live interview. Mr Hollande said: 'When I have information, I’ll communicate it, I’ll do it, but I have none.' 

Mr Hollande, a Socialist, has never expressed any interest in the institution of marriage before, despite having four children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal, another former girlfriend.

But it is thought that Mr Hollande has felt increasingly uncomfortable attending official engagements without an official partner.

Writing on the website of Le Nouvel Observateur, Thierry de Cabarrus, a political commentator, said that if Ms Gayet had found a new lover, she had done Mr Hollande a favour.

'It is possible to imagine that the president, who wants to finish the catastrophic pollution of his political action through reports on his supposed private life, is satisfied by this epilogue.

'He is now going to be able to move on to something else and forget those humiliating moments when political journalists ... asked him questions that had nothing to do with his political life. François Hollande is freed from one hell of a problem.'

Mr de Cabarrus said the president had been plunged into a 'vaudeville' by the disclosure in Closer, a magazine, of his liaison with Ms Gayet in January.
