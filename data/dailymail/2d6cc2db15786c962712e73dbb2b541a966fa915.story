A bullied teenager and her mother are making a desperate plea in hopes that someone will stop the students who have threatened their lives and safety. 

The mother explains that her daughter, who has not be identified for her protection, has been receiving a barrage of messages on social media from some of her classmates at Gordo High School in Alabama that cross the line and have become a serious threat.

In fact, one read; 'Kill yourself or we will kill your family.'

And in another message a student sent the girl a photo of an actual gun.

In one message the students from Gordo High School (above) wrote to her; 'Kill yourself or we kill your family'

'Our families were threatened, houses to be blown up. It was just unreal that kids the age that we think is doing it would do something like that,' the mother told Fox 6.

'Nobody should ever have to go through this…I wouldn't even put it on my worst enemy,' added the teenager.

'I used to wake up and be happy about going to school so see my friends. Now I regret even waking up in the morning.'

Pickens County School Superintendent Jamie Chapman said that police have been contacted and that all is being done to make sure this situation is taken care of and the bullying ends.

And while she may be under constant attack, the teenage victim of all this is staying strong, and sending out a message to others who are also suffering because of bullies. 

'People kill themselves because of this. Y'all are worth every second y'all are on this earth. Don't ever think that you're not because God put you on here for a reason,' she said.
