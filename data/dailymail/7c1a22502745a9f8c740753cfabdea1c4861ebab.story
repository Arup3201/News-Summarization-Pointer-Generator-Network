A stomach-turning incestuous sex trial wrapped  Wednesday after testimony this week that described in new and startling detail the horrors of an Alabama family sex ring.

A jury took just two hours on Wednesday to find Wendy Wood Holland, 35, guilty of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual torture and child endangerment.

The trial gave no clue as to the whereabouts of the presumed dead family member Brittney Wood--whose disappearance gave rise to an investigation that led to the arrest of eight of her family members,

However, it did give voice to abuse victims who claimed the sexual torture started when kids were still in diapers and involved family six-ways.

A teenager testifying to being part of a family sex ring told jurors Tuesday that she was first molested while still in diapers.

Guilty: Horrific details were revealed in this week's testimony in the trial of Wendy Wood Holland, 35 (pictured) in the Baldwin County Circuit Court on Wednesday. She was found guilty on Wednesday of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual torture and child endangerment

Sick: Holland, whose now-deceased husband was believed to be the Alabama sex ring leader, helped indoctrinate her young relatives at a very young age

'With all my heart': A witness Tuesday, a family member who is still a minor, said she still loved Holland while replaying the sick abuse Holland helped to coordinate

The young woman, who is still a minor, said her earliest memories include having sex with adult relatives — one of whom was Holland. Despite that, the teen tearfully said she still loves Holland 'with all my heart.'

The state rested its case following Tuesday's session, during which the teen testified that her relatives often had group sex. She said it sometimes including Holland's missing 19-year-old niece Brittney Wood.

'We would be in a circle and we'd all switch up,' the girl testified.

Prosecutor Teresa Heinz asked how often such things occurred.

'It happened a bunch,' she said. A male relative who pleaded guilty later testified he once had six-way sex with a group of relatives that included the girl and Holland.

Crying, the teen had to stand up to see over the judge's desk to identify Holland as one of the people who abused her.

Holland dabbed at her eyes and looked at the girl only briefly.

Defense lawyer Mitzi Johnson-Theodoro brought up statements in which the girl initially denied Holland had done anything to her, and she said the youth had falsely accused a total of eight people of sexual advances, including the lead police investigator.

The witness said people might have misunderstood her, and she admitted making up two names of two people and accusing them of sexual abuse because a relative was pressuring her for information.

But, the teen said, she was truthful about her allegations about Holland and other close relatives.

'I wouldn't lie to anyone about this,' she said.

In opening statements, Johnson-Theodoro compared the youth to the George Costanza character in the old 'Seinfeld' comedy series, saying that she, like he, told lies that became more and more outrageous.

'Just saying something doesn't make it true,' said Johnson-Theodoro. 'Just believing something doesn't make it true.'

Heinz told the jury of 10 women and four men, including two alternates, that the youth has a hard time recalling specific instances of molestation because it happened so often.

'This was her norm. This is what happened to her on a regular basis,' Heinz said.

Mystery that started it all: Holland's niece, 19-year-old Brittney Wood (pictured with her daughter) vanished in May 2012. The investigation that followed quickly mushroomed into a multi-generational family sex sting that involved eight of Wood's family members including her mother Chessie

Started when they were in diapers: Seen here aged 5 or 6, Brittney Wood was a 19-year-old single mother of a daughter born when she was 17, Wood was molested as a child by a step-grandfather who went to prison for the crime. She is believed to have been involved in the sick family sex parties described in her aunt Wendy Holland's trial

Holland is Brittney Wood's aunt. Eight of Wood's relatives and three family friends have been charged with multiple felonies in two counties since the teen's disappearance.

Brittney Wood's 23-year-old brother Derek Wood, who pleaded guilty to having sex with the underage victim in Holland's case and is awaiting sentencing, said he had sex with Holland too many times to count starting around age 13.

Brittney Wood's mother, Chessie Wood, who also is charged with a sex crime, came to court with her son but wasn't allowed inside because she is a defendant in a related case.

Holland's brother-in-law Dustin Kent testified that he participated in a six-way sexual encounter that included Wendy Holland, the alleged teen victim, and his wife Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland's twin sister.

Kent, who also pleaded guilty to sex charges and is awaiting sentencing, said he first saw Wendy Holland having sex with the alleged victim in October 2011.

'It wasn't like it was her first time. Her and (Holland) had done this before,' said Kent, 38.

Wendy Holland sat expressionless during the testimony of both Wood and Kent, but her lawyer noted that both men are awaiting sentencing and could hope to get lighter punishment for helping prosecutors.

Chessie Wood, Brittney's mother: Two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12.

Derek Wood, Brittney's brother: Second degree rape and second degree sodomy.

Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan: Rape and sex abuse of a child under 12.

Dustin Kent: Two counts of rape, sex abuse, sodomy and production of obscene material of a person under 17. He allegedly raped a 13-year-old while her father looked on

William 'Billy' Brownlee: Two counts of rape, sodomy and sex abuse.

Mendy Kent: Sodomy and sex abuse.

Wendy Holland: Sodomy, sex abuse and child torture.

James Cumbaa: Rape, sodomy, and sex abuse.

Randall Scott Wood: Second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape.

Jennifer Moore: Production of pornography involving minors and second-degree child abuse.

Donald Holland Jr: Incest and second degree rape

Kent admitted to repeatedly lying to investigators when he first denied witnessing a threesome involving the twin sisters and the girl.

A friend of the family was convicted in October in the first trial to result from the investigation.

Wood was last seen with Holland's husband, Donnie, in 2012, and 11 people have since been arrested on sex-related charges. That includes Wendy Holland, on trial on charges of sexually abusing another underage relative.

Authorities said Wood could provide important evidence about sexual crimes by her adult relatives if only they could find her alive. But searches and two years of investigation have failed to turn up any sign of her.

Police believe Wood is dead, possibly killed in the days before the case went public.

Following the disappearance, Holland was charged with sexual abuse, sodomy, sexual torture and child endangerment.

Prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments that Wendy Holland, her late husband and others were monsters who subjected their own children and others to perversions that were almost too depraved to understand, with parents and in-laws using their own young relatives for sex.

Holland used sex toys and other forms of stimulation to groom the alleged victim for sex with adults at an age children typically are watching 'Sesame Street' and learning to color, prosecution witnesses told the jury.

'You have heard testimony over the last two days that no one wants to believe,' prosecutor Nicki Patterson said in closing arguments. 'We want to give family the benefit of the doubt.'

But defense attorney Mitzi Johnson-Theodoro argued that the alleged victim, two other relatives who pleaded guilty to sex charges and a jailhouse friend of Holland were lying when they portrayed her as a serial child abuser.

Under suspicion: Brittney's uncle Dustin Kent is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl while the father allegedly looked on

Neighbors didn't see pornography or sex toys in Holland's home, and prosecutors have no physical evidence, Johnson-Theodoro told jurors. Holland is a loving person who took her own kids trick-or-treating and worked as a certified nursing assistant at a state nursing home for veterans, she said.

'They want you to believe that a woman who cared for the elderly abused children?' Johnson-Theodor said in closing arguments.

Deliberations began after Judge Jody Bishop said deliberations instructed jurors on the fine points of the law.

Donnie Holland was under investigation as the leader of the alleged sex ring at the time of Wood's disappearance, and he died days later of what authorities ruled was a self-inflicted gunshot. 

Regardless of the outcome, the trial was all about Brittney Wood for Christin Huffman, a friend of the missing teen.

Testimony showed Wood was part of at least one family sexual encounter involving Holland, three other adults and two children, but the fact that no one has seen the teen since before the case broke in 2012 wasn't mentioned to jurors.

Seated in the court and wearing a T-shirt decorated with Wood's photo, Huffman dabbed at her eyes as attorneys laid out details of generations of incest allegations involving her friend's family.

'To me the whole thing is about her,' Huffman, 21, said outside court. 'There's no way anyone could look at it and say it's not.'

Wood's older brother and an uncle have pleaded guilty and testified against Holland, and her mother faces sex charges.

Holland was the second person to stand trial in the case. Family friend Billy Brownlee was convicted in October.
