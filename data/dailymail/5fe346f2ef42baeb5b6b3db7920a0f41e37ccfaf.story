Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has urged fans to remain calm as they prepare for a crunch clash with England on Thursday.

A surprise defeat by Costa Rica in their opening match - which Suarez sat out as he continues his recuperation from minor knee surgery last month - has left the South Americans in real danger of not qualifying for the knockout stages.

Suarez is likely to play against England, who also need a victory after their loss to Italy, and has promised to do his utmost to get that vital win.

Message: Luis Suarez has told the Uruguay fans the players will do their utmost to beat England

'It’s been a hard couple of days because of the defeat by Costa Rica,' said the Liverpool striker in a video message on 888poker.com - for whom he is a global ambassador.

'I want to thank you for all the support we received these (last few) days and to tell you to stay calm, we’re going to give our best against England.

'And trust us, we’re the first who want to move forward.'

England forward Raheem Sterling admits he would prefer his Liverpool team-mate Suarez not to be playing for Uruguay on Thursday, adding: 'I'd rather not see him on the pitch. We know he can score some spectacular goals.'

Thanks: Suarez praised the Uruguay fans for their support and told them to 'keep calm'
