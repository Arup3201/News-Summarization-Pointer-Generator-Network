Six men arrested on suspicion of being involved in a plot to murder soldier Lee Rigby have been told they face no further action.

The suspects were all held by Scotland Yard in the days following the Fusilier's brutal killing in Woolwich last May.

One of those, Hayden Allen, was arrested on May 25 - three days after Drummer Rigby 
was knocked down in the road and hacked to death.

The 21-year-old was held on conspiracy to commit murder but denied any involvement in the 'atrocity'.

Yesterday Mr Allen's lawyers said that they had been
notified that the police will not be taking his case further.

In a 
statement, TV Edwards Solicitors said: 'Following his interview and release on bail by 
the police, he asked that they be allowed time fully to investigate the 
case.

'We have today been notified that the police will not be taking
his case further, vindicating him from any involvement in what took 
place.

'Mr Allen would like to this to be known as widely as his 
arrest was publicised. He offers his full condolences to the family and 
friends of Mr Rigby.'

Today Scotland Yard confirmed that a total of six men arrested in connection with the 25-year-old's death on May 22 will face no further action.

They include a 29-year-old man arrested on May 23, and three men aged 24, 28 and 21 - including Mr Allen - arrested on May 25.

A 22-year-old arrested on May 26 and a 50-year-old detained the following day, May 27, have also been told this week that they face no further action, police said.

All had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

Previously two women aged 29 and 31, both arrested on May 23 on conspiracy to commit murder, were later released without charge.

And two men aged 42 and 46, arrested on suspicion of being involved in the supply of illegal firearms, have also already been told they will not face prosecution, police said.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, both deny murder and are due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 18.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
