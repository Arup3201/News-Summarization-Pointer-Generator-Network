A teenager predicted to fail her English A-level was allowed to type her exam answers because of her poor handwriting – and scored the top mark in the country.

Frederica Drewer, 18, who suffers from dyspraxia, had been tipped for a D in English, but exceeded all expectations in her final exam and is now expected to be awarded an A*.

Dyspraxia, also called Clumsy Child Syndrome and Developmental Co-ordination Disorder, is a lifelong neurological condition which can cause problems with language, perception and movement.

Poor handwriting is one of the most 
common symptoms, but people with the condition sometimes also have 
difficulty with routine tasks such as driving and household chores.

Frederica, who is known as Freddie and
lives with her mother Rebecca, a maths teacher, and father Joe, a 
mortgage adviser, was diagnosed last year after her English teacher at 
Ashton Park School noticed she was struggling.

Top marks: Frederica, who has dyspraxia, was allowed to use her laptop in the exam in January

Tony Lansdowne raised concerns about her losing valuable marks for her messy handwriting.

And armed with a laptop, his student 
went on to score the top mark in the country for her final exam on 
Arthur Miller’s play, The Crucible.

She said: ‘I have always had real problems with my spelling and  punctuation and my handwriting is particularly sloppy.

‘Being diagnosed and being able to use
a laptop has made things a  thousand times easier.

'All my teachers have
commented about the huge  difference it has made.’

Freddie says she struggles with 
organisation and spacial issues and found it difficult to keep track of 
what she was writing in handwritten exam scripts.

She sat the paper in January and was given a mark of 99.5 per cent – the highest in the country.

Exam board AQA has asked if it can use her paper as an example to students nationwide.

The exam module paper makes up part of her overall English A-level exam and her predicted D has been changed to an A*.

The teenager from Bristol said: ‘I was
shocked when I picked up the results.

'I went in to school feeling quite
down and I couldn’t believe it when I saw the 99.5 per cent. I was 
expecting to have to re-sit, but when I saw my result I was blown away.’

Mrs Drewer said: ‘People with 
dyspraxia have organisational issues and handwriting issues. Her English
teacher noticed she was making  mistakes which fitted the profile.’

She added: ‘The diagnosis means she 
can now use a laptop to type up her exams rather than handwriting. The 
dyspraxia went undiagnosed for a long time.’

The sixth form student, who is also taking philosophy and psychology, hopes to study philosophy at university after a gap year.

Dyspraxia is a condition that affects movement and coordination during childhood.

Youngsters who have the condition are often labelled as 'clumsy' and sometimes have problems with language and thought.

It is not known exactly what causes it, although it is believed to be a disruption in the way messages from the brain are transmitted to the body.

The condition used to be called 'clumsy child syndrome'.

Children with dyspraxia sometimes additionally have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia or suffer from Autism.

The condition often goes diagnosed, but up to one in 12 children could suffer from it.

There is no cure for dyspraxia, although therapy often helps children with their problems.

Having dyspraxia does not affect intelligence, although children with the condition may need extra help as they might find learning more challenging.
