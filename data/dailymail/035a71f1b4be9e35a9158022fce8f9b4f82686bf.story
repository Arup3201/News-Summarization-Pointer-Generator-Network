One of two adult sons in a family of four found dead inside a California home in June fatally stabbed his parents before he and the other son died in an arson fire there, police said.

39-year-old Rodney Bowman killed his father, 78-year-old Sarkis Babakhan, and mother, 70-year-old Rozmary Babakhan. Bowman and the other son, 42-year-old Robert Babakhan, then died of exposure to smoke and toxic chemicals from the fire.

Turlock fire investigators determined a fire had been deliberately set in the home, said police officer Mayra Lewis.

The parents had been stabbed to death, and it was the younger son, Bowman, who had killed them, deputy coroners and a forensic pathologist with the Stanislaus County Coroner's Office concluded.

Rodney Bowman, 39, stabbed his parents multiple times before he and the other son, Robert Babakhan, 42, died of exposure to smoke and toxic chemicals from the fire, Turlock police said

Turlock police investigated the crime on June 27th. They found the family of four dead inside the home in various rooms

Officers made the discovery at the home  after a family member called to report that the four had not been seen or heard from

It was unclear who started the fire or what motivated the stabbings.

Robert Babakhan was disabled and died after the fire had gone out, police said.

Police spokeswoman Mayra Lewis declined to elaborate in a call Wednesday.

Authorities
 initially described the deaths as a murder-suicide and said the bodies 
were found in various places inside the house.

Investigators were seen wearing gas masks while entering the house. The parents were stabbed multiple times while their sons were killed in a fire

They said the four family members had been dead at least 24 hours before officers found them June 26.

Neighbors said one of the son's was developmentally disabled.

Police said there was no danger to the community.

Because everyone in the home is deceased, it's hard to say who intentionally set the fire," Officer Mayra Lewis said.

In late June, authorities described the deaths as a murder-suicide.
