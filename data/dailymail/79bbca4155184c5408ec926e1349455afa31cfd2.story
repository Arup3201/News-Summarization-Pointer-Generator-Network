Sir Bradley Wiggins will not ride for Team Sky in this year’s Tour de France, team principal Sir David Brailsford has confirmed.

He will, instead, be racing on the track for Team England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The 2012 champion had long since indicated that he would not be included in a squad built around Chris Froome, who last year succeeded him as yellow jersey winner.

Out: Sir Bradley Wiggins will not compete in this year's Tour de France

Crowning glory: Wiggins became the first Briton to win the tour in 2012

In response
 to the news, Team England have confirmed that the four-time Olympic 
champion will now be competing at the Commonwealth Games instead.

British
 cycling coach Shane Sutton said: 'I'm very happy to be able to welcome 
Sir Bradley back to the track team for the Commonwealth Games - his 
addition will be a real morale boost to the rest of the track squad. The
 decision of who will ride what event will be made nearer the time.'

And
 Team England Chef de Mission Jan Paterson added: 'We are delighted 
that Sir Bradley will be returning to the track for Team England in 
Glasgow.'

'It's
 hugely exciting for the Team, the sport and spectators that they'll be 
able to see one of our finest athletes back in the Velodrome for the 
first time in a number of years.'

Froome, meanwhile, will be supported on the Grand Tour by his trusted 
lieutenant Richie Porte in a team also featuring Wiggins’ fellow Great 
Britain Olympian Geraint Thomas.

Mikel Nieve, Bernhard Eisel, Vasil Kiryienka, David Lopez, Danny Pate and Xabier Zandio complete the line-up.

The Tour starts with the Grand Depart in Yorkshire next Saturday and continues until the traditional Champs Elysees climax on July 27.

Brailsford 
said: 'Team Sky returns to the Tour de France with the reigning champion
 and we are looking to win the yellow jersey for the third time in three
 years and a second consecutive time for Chris Froome.

'We
 know how hard it is to win this race and that it takes a totally 
focused and carefully constructed team, with the right blend of riders, 
to give us the best chance of victory.

Each
 rider has been selected to play a specific role which will involve 
total sacrifice and commitment to the team’s ambition of reaching the 
Champs Elysees in yellow.'

Froome has 
been in good form this season, winning both the Tour of Oman and Tour de
 Romandie and leading the Criterium du Dauphine until he was hampered by
 a crash on stage six.

He
 kept the lead that day, Thomas playing a key role in getting him back 
into the pack, but was overhauled the following day and eventually 
finished 12th.

Porte
 helped Froome to victory last year and, along with Kiryienka and Lopez,
 will have a key role to play in the climbing sections.

Zandio
 and Nieve are also seen as climbing specialists while Pate and 
especially Eisel will be expected to push the pace along in the flat and
 cobbled sections.
