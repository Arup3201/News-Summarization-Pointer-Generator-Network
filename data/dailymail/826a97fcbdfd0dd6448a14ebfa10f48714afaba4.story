David Cameron’s spokesman refused ten times yesterday to say whether the Prime Minister would support fracking near his home in Oxfordshire.

After Mr Cameron said gas drilling should be welcomed across the country, his spokesman would not be drawn over the prospect of wells in the Prime Minister’s own backyard where there are shale rocks.

The spokesman would say only that ‘ultimately the Prime Minister supports fracking’ and there should be a ‘dialogue with local people’ about any attempts to extract the fuel.

David Cameron: 'Ultimately' the Prime Minister supports fracking and there should be a 'dialogue with local people', according to his spokesman

Asked several times whether, as a local resident, Mr Cameron – MP for Witney in Oxfordshire – would support such an application, the spokesman added: ‘While I’m unwilling to get into a hypothetical of where a well may or may not be opened, the point is anywhere in the country where there is that possibility of shale gas exploration taking place it is important for  dialogue to take place with local people, and that is as relevant in his constituency as it would be in any area of this country.’

In a newspaper article published yesterday, the Prime Minister urged communities to ‘seize’ the chance to have shale gas exploration near their homes, saying drill sites are only the size of a cricket pitch and there is little evidence the process causes environmental damage or contaminates water  supplies as campaigners have claimed.

Fracking could create 70,000 jobs and lower energy bills for millions, while communities which accept it will be given sweeteners of £100,000 for their area, he said.

Mr Cameron points to the US where a decade of fracking has seen gas prices plummet and the country is now virtually self-sufficient in energy. But independent experts say it is still unclear whether it will lower bills at all in Britain.

Earlier this year, the British Geological Survey released its report on shale reserves in northern England, predicting there could be 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas underground – in theory enough to meet Britain’s needs for more than a century.

But Richard Sarsfield-Hall, an energy markets experts at Pöyry Management Consulting, said the gas which could be extracted would at most produce 25 per cent of what is needed in the UK and would ‘not lead to a collapse in prices’.

In contrast, the US had a ‘glut’ of gas which saw prices plummet.

Fracking – short for hydraulic fracturing – involves drilling a well up to 3,000ft deep and pumping water and chemicals into it at high pressure to crack the rocks and release fuel trapped inside. It has so far taken place in Lancashire after a delay of some months  following two small earthquakes. Dozens more wells could be drilled there in the next two years.

In the South, across Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, there is also thought to be plentiful shale oil or gas, but fierce protests have accompanied the drilling of an exploratory well in the village of Balcombe, West Sussex.

Last night Ian Hudspeth, leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said: ‘Any applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis, but we haven’t had any so far.

‘Personally I feel we have got an energy crisis in this country and we’ve got to look at all forms of alternative energy, if the relevant safeguards are in place and it is not in an area of outstanding natural beauty.’

÷ Downing Street said Mr Cameron would support England when they play Scotland in a football friendly at Wembley tomorrow. His spokesman initially deflected the question, but it was later conceded that he would back Roy Hodgson’s team.
