Tragic shooting: Adrian Broadway lost her life in a shooting on Saturday morning after being struck in the head by a bullet outside the home of Willie Noble

A mischievous prank turned deadly on Saturday after a 15-year-old girl was allegedly shot dead by an irate Arkansas homeowner who is now facing first-degree murder charges.

Adrian Broadway was allegedly hit in the head by Willie Noble, 48, after the teenage girl and five other friends covered Noble's car with leaves, eggs and mayonnaise just before 1am on Saturday morning.

It was the second prank Broadway and her friends had played on Noble that evening - causing him to burst out of his home in Little Rock firing his gun at the car containing the teen and her friends.

The panicked teens managed to race away from Noble's home and made it as far as the local Kum & Go gas station where they phoned an ambulance for Broadway.

She was raced to Arkansas Children's Hospital but sadly died from her injuries.

Noble was arrested by police and charged with one count of first degree murder, one count of a terroristic act and five counts of aggravated assault - for firing on the other passengers of the white Hyundai Sonata.

Lieutenant Sidney Allen said this was all the result of a prank that happened three months ago.

'Apparently Mr. Noble's teenage son had 
done a prank on some of the kids that were inside the vehicle on 
Halloween Night. As a result they were doing a retaliation prank and it 
ultimately had deadly results,' Allen explained.
