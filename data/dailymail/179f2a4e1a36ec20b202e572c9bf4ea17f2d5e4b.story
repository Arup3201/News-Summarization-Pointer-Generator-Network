Service for HBO GO subscribers went down Sunday night during one of the most anticipated premieres this year: Game of Thrones.

Less than a month after subscribers took to Twitter to vent over its crash during the finale of True Detective, the latest debacle is also causing a stir online.

HBO GO acknowledged the problem on Twitter, advising subscribers that they were working on the problem, and instructing them to 'send a raven.'

People gathered around televisions and computers to watch the season four premiere of the fantasy show, but many were greeted with 'fatal error' messages.

Many on Twitter conveyed the horror of the situation.

'In an apartment full of disgruntled gays, @hbogo I will never forgive you for this,' tweeted one.

The premium cable service blamed the technical difficulties on 'excessive volume' and promised to provide the episode on HBO on Demand shortly.Game of Thrones-themed jokes abounded on the Twitter, and many also noted that HBO GO's servers are likely overburdened due to millenials using their parents HBO accounts rather than purchasing subscriptions of their own.Â 

'Why don't you guys write letters to HBO complaining about how HBO Go is down? Or I mean, get your mom, the HBO subscriber, to write a letter,' tweeted one Twitter user.HBO told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement later Sunday night: 'HBO GO did experience issues due to overwhelming demand around the premiere of Game of Thrones. The service has returned to several platforms and we are working hard towards full recovery, which we expect soon.'

According to the HBO Twitter account, full service has now been restored.
