They are seen by many as uncomfortable relics from the Victorian age.

But it seems corsets are undergoing a revival – as well as the hourglass figures they create.

One leading retailer, What Katie Did, which specialises in the garment, said it had seen sales grow by half in the last three months.

Online retailer eBay also boasted of a 54 per cent surge in modern corset sales since December.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian posted a picture of herself wearing a corset in October, sparking a trend

What Katie Did founder Katie Thomas said she believes part of the rise in popularity is down to reality television star Kim Kardashian 'with her tiny waist and big hips'. 

Miss Kardashian posted a picture of herself wearing a corset on her Instagram page in October last year with the hashtag 'waist training'. 

Mrs Thomas said: 'It's more about being confident, powerful and being in control while looking good as well. It has absolutely nothing to do with men at all.' 

She added: 'This year is a peak year and the last peak year was 1955; before that it was 1895.' 

More recently, actress Lily James has shown off a tiny corseted waist in pictures for the Disney film Cinderella.

In pictures released ahead of the film, which will be shown in cinemas later this month, actress Lily James came under fire for her tiny waist.

In the film, Miss James, 25, wears a pale blue ball gown, which goes in at the waist before billowing out.

Rather than an extreme diet, Miss James, who rose to fame in television series Downton Abbey, revealed that her slimline figure was created by a corset.

Speaking to American entertainment website E! Miss James told of how she had been restrained to a liquid diet in order to fit into the contraption.

She said: 'If you ate food it didn't really digest properly, and I'd be burping all afternoon […] and it was just really sort of unpleasant.

'I'd have soup so that I could still eat but it wouldn't get stuck.'

In an interview with The Huffington Post, Miss James added: 'I'm very healthy and I always have been.

'The costume is beautifully designed; it goes in at the waist and the skirt is big and full and accentuates the shape. I felt like a princess in it. Corsets are always hard to wear.'

Costume designer Sandy Powell said that getting Miss James into the corset took up to 10 minutes.

In an interview with fashion magazine ELLE, she said of the corset: 'Of course it feels different from wearing a T-shirt—it's restrictive.

'If the corset is made well by a proper corset-maker and fit to the exact measurements of the person wearing it, there should be no pain whatsoever. You put it on, it feels tight, and eventually it loosens up and molds itself to your body.'

Stars including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Madonna have also been photographed in corsets.

Actress Cate Blanchett, who was awarded a BAFTA for her portrayal of the queen in 1988 film Elizabeth I said of her costume: 'I'm one of those strange beasts who really likes a corset.'

Yet now the type of underwear, which can reduce waist size by up to four inches, has also soared in popularity with normal women.

Corsets are also being used by some as a weight loss technique. One online business The Corset Diet, claims that wearing a corset, which comes with a pricetag starting at £55, can help shed weight 'within weeks'.

Yet critics of the corset warn that the garment can damage muscles and affect breathing.

If too tight, a corset could bruise the kidneys and liver, experts have warned.
