A Queensland father accused of killing his toddler son has been excused from appearing in court.

Shane Purssell Akehurst, 33, had a grievous bodily harm charge upgraded to murder on Saturday after his son Corby died in hospital.

It's alleged Akehurst assaulted Corby repeatedly over the past four months. The toddler, who had not yet turned two, was airlifted to hospital with critical injuries from Kin Kin, near Gympie, on Wednesday, but died on Friday night.

Akehurst was originally charged with grievous bodily harm and four counts of assault occasioning bodily harm. He's now charged with murder, torture and five counts of assault occasioning bodily harm.

Akehurst, who is in custody, was excused from appearing in the Brisbane Magistrates Court when his case was mentioned on Monday. His lawyer requested the matter be adjourned until May 4.

It's been reported that Corby was just a few months shy of his second birthday when his father allegedly threw him repeatedly against a timber bed at their home after he would not stop crying on Wednesday.

The little boy died late Friday evening after succumbing to critical injuries.

Prosecutor Wayne Kelly told Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday that Corby began convulsing after his dad threw him against the bed numerous times and was left on the bedroom floor.

He said the toddler's mother Kylie Woodford arrived home a short time later and called emergency services before the toddler was airlifted to Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital.

Since then police have worked around the clock investigating the circumstances surrounding the boy's critical injuries and subsequent death. 

Police will allege through medical history inquiries that the child sustained injuries over an extended period of time which ended in his death on Friday night.
