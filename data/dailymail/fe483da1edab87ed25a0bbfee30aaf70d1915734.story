Actress Misty Upham has been missing for more than a week, and her frantic family believe police in suburban Seattle are not doing enough to locate her.

Upham's father, Charles Upham, told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder.

The 32-year-old Native American actress was reported missing by her family October 6, a day after telling police she was suicidal. Her father told the station he doesn't believe his daughter would kill herself.

Family speak out: Parents of actress Misty Upham, 32, who has been missing since October 6, say police in Auburn, Washington, are not taking her disappearance seriously  

Ms Upham, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, is best known for her roles in August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained. 

She has been listed as missing in the Washington Crime Information Center database.

The family said Upham had moved to the Seattle area to help care for her father, who's recovering from a stroke. She had been staying at a relative's apartment on the Muckleshoot reservation.

Police Commander Steve Stocker told The Seattle Times Upham is not considered an endangered missing person because her disappearance has to be unexplained, involuntary or suspicious.

But Misty's father said his daughter was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication.

‘It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,’ he said. ‘She's out there, she's missing, she needs help.’

Despite previous statements, Charles Upham said he does not believe his daughter would take her own life.

‘She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,’ he said. ‘She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.’ 

Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter.

Phone Call: Upham's father recently revealed the last conversation he had with his daughter where she said that he and her mother didn't 'have to worry about her anymore

Where is Misty? Upham's parents have been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters

'We are disappointed that the police are not doing more to help find Misty,' she said. 'Right now the only people looking for her are myself, my husband and son and daughter.

Mrs Upham attributed the police department's alleged inaction to her daughter's Native-American background.

'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' Mona Upham said. 

'Missing person': The police did not comply to Upham's father's request to have his daughter listed as a 'missing person.'

The mother went on to say that their family cannot afford to hire a private investigator to look for Misty, so they have been canvassing the neighborhood on their own and hanging 'missing' posters. They believe the 32-year-old is still alive but needs help.

In a statement posted Sunday to the actress' Facebook page, Charles Upham wrote that as a father, he does not fear she committed suicide.

‘I think Misty may have walked into nearby woods and got hurt and can't reach help or I think she may have had an encounter with someone who may have caused her harm. I believe she would contact us if she could,’ he stated. 

Upham was last seen near her Auburn home October 5. Police responded to a suicide call at her apartment, People magazine reported, but when they arrived, Upham was not there  and officers were not able to contact her.

This is not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence. 

The magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. 

Upham's father recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he fears his daughter is suicidal. 

'She had recently changed her medication, so she was sort of having erratic behavior,' Upham's father told THR. 'She told me and her mom that we didn't have to worry about her any more. … I thought it sounded suicidal myself, so I called the police. 

'She's always been a suicidal person.'

Charles Upham went on to say that Misty sometimes made suicide threats, but 'never went through with it.'

People reported that Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her disappearance. A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent.

One day after Upham went missing, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.'

The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today.

Facebook: With police putting no resources into her case, Upham's family took to Facebook to enlist the help of the public in finding Upham

Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. 

In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. 

We are asking for help from people who live in the area to search the wooded areas near the Muckleshoot casino.' The post stated that the police are not looking for Upham.

Another post revealed that Upham's family has no income.

'[The] father is recovering from a recent stroke and is disabled.,' the post reads, '...mother is disabled with congestive heart failure...the family is dependent on donations.

The family wrote in the post that they are 'doing everything within our means to bring our daughter home safe.'

Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.'   Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.
