Marine conservation campaigners have offered a £2,000 reward to anyone who turns in the hit-and-run killer of a young dolphin.

The calf was fatally injured by the propeller of a boat after up to 20 vessels were accused of ‘harassing’ an inshore pod of dolphins off the Cornish coast.

Police are now investigating the death. The cash reward for information leading to an arrest has been put up by the charity Sea Shepherd UK.

Witnesses said powerboats raced into 
the Camel estuary near Padstow and surrounded a pod of protected 
bottlenose dolphins swimming close to the shore. It is thought one of 
the boats collided with the calf by accident.

Yesterday, Abby Crosby, of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘A bottlenose dolphin was killed. It’s a massive tragedy.

‘Inshore pods are so rare and special.
There are only three recognised inshore pods resident around the coast 
in the UK and one of them is in Cornwall.

'There are only between eight 
and a dozen dolphins in this pod and to lose one is drastic. We need to 
educate powerboat owners about how special this species is.

‘I believe everyone was alerted that 
the pod was out in the estuary and they went out. I think some speedboat
owners were very excited to see them.

‘These dolphins are protected by the 
Wildlife Act of 1981 and you cannot plead ignorance of the law. You 
cannot follow a pod because that is harassment. They can follow boats, 
but boat owners should turn their engines off.

‘These creatures are insanely intelligent. They will mourn a calf – they are not like wild animals with little intelligence.’

'I understand it was not a deliberate 
act but an accident but we need to educate power boat owners about how 
special this species is'

Abby Crosby, Marine Conservation Officer with the Cornwall Wildlife Trust

Faye Archell, of British Divers Marine
Life Rescue, said: ‘There were a number of private, commercial and 
sightseeing vessels in the area at that time.

'Padstow sightseeing 
vessels are all trained how to behave responsibly around wildlife. 
However, passengers may have witnessed the harassment by other vessels.’

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman 
said: ‘Specialist wildlife crime-trained police officers are 
investigating reports of a dead bottlenose dolphin which was seen in the
Camel estuary, Padstow, on Saturday.

‘It is believed a pod of dolphins 
entered the estuary at about 1.30pm. They were followed by up to 20 
boats until about 4.45pm when they left the estuary.

‘A pleasure boat running cruises area then saw the body of a dead dolphin.’

The pod belongs to a sub-species of 
bottlenose dolphins that spend their lives inshore. Bottlenose dolphins –
which have regional accents, with the whistles made by those off Wales 
different to those living off the Irish coast – are altruistic and will 
go to the aid of humans in distress.

Prosecution under the Wildlife Act can lead to a £5,000 fine and six months’ jail.
