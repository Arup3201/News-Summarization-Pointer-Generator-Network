A racist 22-year-old woman has been fired from her job and reported to the Secret Service after writing on her Facebook page her hopes that President Obama is assassinated in his second term in office.

'And another 4 years of the n*****. Maybe he will get assassinated this term..!!' Denise Helms of Turlock, California wrote immediately after the president's re-election on Tuesday.

It didn't take long for her post to circulate, angering enough readers to report her to authorities who accuse her of threatening the president's life.

Under fire: Denise Helms has been fired from her job at an ice cream shop and reported to Secret Service after writing this post on her Facebook page hoping the president is assassinated

I'm innocent: Speaking about the incident on Thursday Ms Helms, 22, was visibly shaken by it but said she was surprised while believing she hasn't done anything wrong

'I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal,' she told KTXL on Thursday while visibly shaken up, but unapologetic and unsure of what she did wrong.

'The assassination part is harsh and I'm not saying that I would go and do that or anything like that by any means but if it was to happen I don't think I would care one bit,' she said.

Now fired from her job at a local Cold Stone Creamery on Thursday, the post was described as disgusting by the store's director who told the Modesto Bee that when he arrived to work he had more than 20 angry voice messages on his company’s machine directed toward Ms Helms.

‘We made the decision because of her comments, but also the community feedback,' said Director Chris Kegle who had employed Ms Helms for less than one year.

Standing alone: Cold Stone Creamery called her action disgusting and no reflection of their own views after receiving angry calls to their store

Not taking it back: Ms Helms, seen behind the ice cream counter, had worked for the company for less than a year before being fired for something she hasn't apologized for

'We are very into working with the community and doing community service. So when your community does not like you because of an employee, that's bad. We have a business to run.'

Despite all this, she said she wouldn't take her comments back.

Not registered: Ms Helms said Obama hasn't done anything for the U.S. while according to state records she is not registered to vote

'He has done absolutely nothing for this country,' she explained.

The Modesto Bee reports Ms Helms being a fan of Republican rival Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan’s campaign according to her Facebook page but report her not registered in the state’s registry to vote.

Asked by KTXL if she’s racist after additionally using the N-word in referring to Obama, she defended herself as not, but also didn't disagree with herself using it.

That disagreement was in sharp 
contrast to Twitter users across the country, however, who angrily 
branded her Facebook post among a list of others titled: 'Yes, You're 
Racist.'

Some even shared their own hinted threats against Ms Helms as well.

‘I
 jst [sic] got a sweet tooth! how does ice cream from Cold Stone in 
Turlock California in the month of November sound?’ one woman wrote.

Secret Service Agent Scott Gillingham in Sacramento says Ms Helms’ post is being investigated with threats against the president having the potential to lead to felony charges.
