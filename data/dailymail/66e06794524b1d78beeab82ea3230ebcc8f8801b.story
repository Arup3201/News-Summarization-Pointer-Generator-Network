Oysters which have been grown at a West Country site for the first time in 120 years have been given the highest status, which means they can be eaten directly from the sea. 

The oysters have been grown at Porlock Bay in Somerset for the first time since the natural crop was decimated by powerful trawlers which swept the beds clean. 

Now locals are reaping the benefits of a community-led project to reintroduce the shellfish industry to the area, with the ripening of the first crop. 

Oysters have been grown for the first time in 120 years in Porlock Bay in Somerset following a community-led project and have been grown in seawater classed as so pure they can be eaten directly from the sea 

The oysters are considered to be grown in such pure seawater they have been given grade A status by the Food Standards Agency. This means they can be eaten directly from the sea without having to be treated or washed. Only one other area in the UK has the same status.  

Locals in Somerset have been seen with mobile stalls on the beach, offering people the chance to sample the first harvest from the waters for more than a century. 

Oysters from Porlock Bay were once a sought after delicacy, supplying many restaurants in London throughout the 1800s. 

But after the natural crop were ruined, a community project was launched.  

Porlock Bay oysters used to be served in London restaurants in the 1800s when the crop was plentiful 

The crop has ripened for the first time in 120 years and sellers were seen on the beach with the shellfish 

The oysters are being grown and harvested by a just five locals who have joined forces to bring the industry back to the area. The group, known as Porlock Futures, are trying to raise £90,000 to set up the business properly over the next five years.

They hope to make the business the first community sustainable shellfish farm in England and Wales. 

Roger Hall, one of the organisers of Porlock Futures, told the Western Morning News: 'We need £90,000 to set the business up properly over next five years – that will pay for premises, stock, packaging, cleaning and so on. 

The new crop of oysters are considered such high quality they have been awarded grade A status 

The crop of oysters has been grown by the Porlock Futures project, a group of five local volunteers 

In trying to raise part of that money in the community, we sent letters out asking for a loan to match-fund any grants – and in less than three weeks we've had 74 positive replies from people in the parish with around £40,000 on offer.'

Mr Hall said he hopes that Porlock Bay oysters could be back on the market, at least on a small scale, by mid-summer.  

Experts said that oysters taste differently depending on the water they are in and what they are feeding on.
