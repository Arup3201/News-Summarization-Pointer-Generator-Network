'I'm gonna flip this bus!': Maquel Donyel Morris is accused of attacking a Greyhound driver in Arizona early Thursday, causing the bus to careen into a median, injuring dozens

Dozens were injured early Thursday when a crazed man attacked the driver of a Greyhound bus, causing it to smash into a median in the middle of the Arizona desert.

Police say Maquel Donyel Morris, 25, was 'very high' when he assaulted the driver before 2am near Tonopah and nearly caused the bus to swerve into oncoming traffic on Interstate 10 as he screamed, 'I'm gonna flip this bus!'

Three of the 41 passengers had to be airlifted from the scene after Morris very nearly accomplished his goal before running off into the desert with his girlfriend only to return 30 minutes later.

That's when Arizona authorities placed him under arrest.

'He was hallucinating ... we believe 
he was very high,' Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart 
Graves told the LA Times.

According to Graves, Morris's girlfriend informed police Graves was under the influence of methamphetamine.

Despite
 all his efforts, the bus remained upright and none of the 24 people 
taken to hospitals had life-threatening injuries, the DPS said.

Passengers
 say that's thanks in large part to the efforts of the as yet unnamed 
driver, who at no point in the terrifying ordeal took his hands off the 
steering wheel.

While he was being pummeled, the driver called for passengers to 'get this guy off me,' passenger Gregory Forte told KNXV.

Terrifying: Dozens were injured and three had to be airlifted from the side of I-10 after the bus smashed into the median

'They're gonna kill me! Call my mom': Morris fled into the desert wilds with his girlfriend before returning 30 minutes later. That's when police arrested him and his bizarre state of mind became all too apparent

'The passengers descended on him,' DPS spokesman Bart Graves told The Associated Press.

The
 injuries included a broken sternum suffered by one of the passengers 
who helped restrain the attacker, said DPS Officer Carrick Cook, another
 DPS spokesman.

The attacker and his female companion got off the bus when it stopped and fled into the desert wilds 50 miles outside Phoenix.

Thirty minutes later, the couple returned for unknown reasons and the suspect was arrested by highway patrol.

The girlfriend told azfamily.com that he was 'paranoid' and 'did not want to be on the bus.'Â 

'Pull him off me!': There were 41 passengers aboard the Dallas-bound bus, some of whom quickly pulled the attacker off the driver around 2am before it came to a stop about 50 miles outside Phoenix

'He started crying and I knew something was wrong,' passenger Gregory Forte said of Morris in the moments before the attack. 'It was bizarre. I hope I never have to go through anything like this ever again'

As he was hauled away in a police car, Morris continued his frightening behavior.

'They're going to kill me,' he screamed from the back of the car to his girlfriend. 'Call my mom!'

Morris was taken to a hospital for treatment of a drug-induced condition and was expected to be booked on suspicion of numerous counts of endangerment, assault and aggravated assault, the DPS said.

Greyhound spokeswoman Alexandra Pedrini said the bus was carrying 41 passengers, plus the driver.

Westbound lanes of I-10 were closed for 30 minutes so helicopters could land and shuttle out the most injured among the passengers.

The 20 or so passengers left behind were seen huddled with blankets by the highway waiting for a relief bus to come.

Most of them were thankful just to be alive.

Could have been much worse: Multiple children and at least two infants were reportedly aboard the bus, though police say miraculously no one sustained life threatening injuries

Creepy: The 20 or so passengers left over after the injured ones were taken to the hospital were huddled alongside the road until a relief bus came to take them to their destinations. Here, the bus as it appeared while still stranded in the I-10 median in the early morning hours

'I thought we were all gonna die,' Chrissy Sanchez, who was asleep before the attack as many passengers were, told azfamily.com. 'I woke up to this commotion. I remember hearing screaming. ... I realized we were not on the road anymore.'

Gregory Forte recalled the moment he knew something wasn't right about his fellow passenger.

'He started crying and I knew something was wrong,' Forte said of Morris. 'It was bizarre. I hope I never have to go through anything like this ever again.'

Greyhound spokeswoman Alexandra Pedrini said that, in addition to the police investigation, Greyhound would be conducting their own internal investigation.

'It could have been a lot worse,' Cook said.
