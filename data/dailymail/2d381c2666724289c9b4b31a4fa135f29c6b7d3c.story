Commons Speaker John Bercow is swapping the chamber for the studio to spend a day as guest editor of Radio 4’s Today programme.

The MP is one of five famous names taking over the running of the current affairs show during the festive season from Boxing Day to New Years Eve.

Comic Lenny Henry, Everything But The Girl singer Tracey Thorn and former Bank of England governor Lord King of Lothbury will also take part.

Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stepped down as chairman of an inquiry into allegations of child abuse by establishment figures in the summer, has already been announced as the fifth guest editor.

Mr Bercow, who was elected Speaker in 2009, will edit the programme on Boxing Day and will interview Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and his personal hero, tennis player Roger Federer.

Thorn’s programme will pay tribute to Kate Bush, while Lord King will return to his old school in Wolverhampton to examine the state of education.

Today editor Jamie Angus said: 'Today’s Christmas guest editors bring us stories, angles, and interviews we wouldn’t normally find ourselves. This year’s crop has reached the very top in politics, finance, the law, and entertainment. The breadth of their experience and the diversity of their interests will provide a real treat for the listeners.'

Each guest is responsible for around half of the programme’s content. They follow in the footsteps of Professor Stephen Hawking and Bono in taking over the show as the station brings in prominent figures to shape the agenda over the Christmas period.
