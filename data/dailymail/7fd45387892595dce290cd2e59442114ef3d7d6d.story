After suffering four devastating miscarriages, Grace and James Slattery resigned themselves to the fact they would never have a child together.

But they are now preparing to celebrate their first Christmas as a very extended family, after Mrs Slattery, 32, miraculously gave birth to quadruplets.

The couple, from County Limerick, Ireland, spend four years trying to have children and tragically suffered four miscarriages.

They had suffered such heartache with each miscarriage they decided not to put themselves through IVF treatment, and gave up their dream of having a baby together.

It was then that, incredibly, the couple received the news that Mrs Slattery had become pregnant completely naturally.

What came next was even more of a shock: she was pregnant with quadruplets.

Grace Slattery, 32, had suffered four miscarriages which had left her heartbroken. But soon afterwards she found out she was pregnant - with quadruplets. She gave birth to  Mollie Rose (left, dressed as a reindeer),   Lucas James (second from left, dressed as Santa), Lily-Grace May (second from right, dressed as a Santa in stripy trousers) and Amelia Helen (right, dressed as an elf)

Mr and Mrs Slattery had given up on having children after the miscarriages, and had even turned down IVF treatment in case it didn't work. Now, they are looking forward to their first Christmas with their new family

The babies were born by Caesarean section when Mrs Slattery was 32 weeks pregnant. One daughter, Amelia, was born with a congenital defect, but luckily was big enough to survive the surgery she needed

Doctors said the story really is a miracle, as the chances of conceiving quadruplets naturally is around one in 10,000.

Now, Mr and Mrs Slattery are looking forward to celebrating their first Christmas together with their now seven-month-old babies.

Mrs Slattery said: 'We call them our fantastic four. We cannot believe our babies are seven months old now - time flies and we are so looking forward to their first Christmas.

'Friends and family have been showering them with presents already- they have a Christmas songs CD which they love and helps to calm them down.'

'The babies are our Christmas miracles - we are blessed.

'Just when we thought we couldn't go through any more and we were ready to give up, we received the best news ever.

'I really want to encourage other women to keep trying, because if we'd given up we wouldn't have the babies we do now.'

Miss Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, said the chances of conceiving quadruplets is ‘extremely rare’

She told MailOnline: ‘If it’s totally spontaneous, the incidence of natural quadruplets is one in 10,000.’

She added that Mr and Mrs Slattery’s story should give hope to others who have had miscarriages in the past.

She said: ‘Many people who have recurrent miscarriages, there is no reason why. Doctors can’t find a reason why.

‘There is a huge miscarriage service in central London. One of the most important things it does to help these women give support and care.

‘Someone needs to help them keep going, not to give up, because they will get there eventually.’

‘This is what happened to this couple - they had a bad run but then they got their stroke of luck.’

However, she warned giving birth to quadruplets does come with some increased health risks for mother and baby.

‘Multiple pregnancies increase the risk of developing high blood pressure. The mother will need to have Caesarean, which is a major surgery.

‘The babies come a lot earlier, they will need neonatal help. 

'But in the UK if a woman gets to 32 weeks and the babies are well grown, there is a 97 per cent chance they will survive.'

The couple's daughters Amelia Helen, Mollie Rose, Lily-Grace May, and son, Lucas James will enjoy their first experience of sitting by the Christmas tree and opening presents, as their parents are kept busy looking after them.

Mrs Slattery said: 'We are going to my parents for Christmas dinner so we can actually all sit down and enjoy it.

'Otherwise, James and I would be so busy with all the babies we would probably end up having Christmas dinner really late, in front of the TV.

'We want this Christmas to be magical - as we are so grateful to have all of our babies with us.'

And one of their daughters, Amelia, is a double miracle.

She was born with a birth defect and her parents were told she would only last a few hours after being born.

Amelia was diagnosed with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia - a hole in the diaphragm that allows the contents of the abdomen to move into the chest cavity and the organs to move into the wrong place.

Mrs Slattery said: 'We were told if Amelia was born too small, no surgeon would operate on her and due to her hernia, her heart was in the wrong place and lungs weren't properly developed.'

Thankfully, at 4lbs 3oz, Amelia was the biggest of the bunch and she had life-saving surgery as soon as she was born.

Mrs Slattery said: 'We are so thankful to the Crumlin Children's Hospital for saving our little girl's life.

'She has regular check-ups but has been a little fighter from the word go - she bit the doctor in the hospital!'

Mr and Mrs Slattery still remember how they had almost given up hope of having the family they always dreamed of.

Even when they were told she was pregnant, they remained cynical because of the four previous miscarriages they'd suffered.

Mrs Slattery said: 'When we went for the babies' first scan we thought we'd lost another baby.

'But we were given amazing news that we were definitely pregnant, everything was well and we were actually having quads.

'We left with mixed emotions as we were essentially told not to hold our breath, as quads usually don't survive.'

The couple were told to not get their hopes up at every appointment for the next 26 weeks.

The babies were finally born the day before Mrs Slattery was due to have a C-section at 32 weeks and six days.

Amelia Helen was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz (right) , and Mollie Rose was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz (second from right). Their brother Lucas James was born weighing 3lbs 10oz (left) and sister Lily- Grace May weighed 3lbs 4oz (second from left)

The quads, who were born in May this year, get through 35 nappies a day, their mother said 

Amelia Helen was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz, and Mollie Rose was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz.

Their brother Lucas James was born weighing 3lbs 10oz and sister Lily- Grace May weighed 3lbs 4oz.

Mrs Slattery said: 'We are so glad our babies survived. We are delighted with our four healthy and happy little miracles. I never let myself dream this could happen.'

The quads, who were born in May this year, get through 35 nappies a day and certainly have childminder Grace and insulation consultant James rushed off their feet.

Mrs Slattery said: 'The babies are eating three meals a day now plus two bottles and are certainly keeping us busy. I worked as a child minder for years but nothing could have prepared me for this.

'It's hard work but it is so worth it to see our healthy, happy children.

'I can't wait to see their faces when they open their Micky Mouse teddies on Christmas day - they are mad for Disney.'

'I can't wait to see their faces when they open their Micky Mouse teddies on Christmas day- they are mad for Disney,' Mrs Slattery says
