A self-styled 'Lord' led the life of an international playboy bankrolled by a £34.5million  global fraud scam, a court heard today.

‘Lord’ Edward Davenport, 46, hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion, and boasted of befriending A list celebrities and royalty including supermodel Kate Moss, and Princes William and Harry.

But Fast Eddie, as he was known to his friends, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped 51 victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes.

The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments.

Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport’s scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence.

Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as India, Canada and Dubai.

Davenport, who was sentenced to seven and a half years behind bars, was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the beginning of a three week confiscation hearing.

Prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said Davenport is thought to have made £34.5m gained through his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit from his enterprises during the six year con, between 2003 and 2009. 

But Davenport will argue he should only pay back £8m of his criminal proceeds.

‘The prosecution figure of over £34m arises from the application of three statutory assumptions in the proceeds of crime act’, said Mr Mayo.

‘The figure under the first assumption of £17.5m is made up principally of money transferred into bank accounts during that six year period.

‘We assume any of the property held by the defendant at any time after the date of conviction, May 19, 2011, was obtained by him as a result of general criminal conduct.

‘That amounts to £12.5m.’

He said the total amount Davenport is thought to have made is comprised of inflation in the value of money, and profit from other property deals.

Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco.

He lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech.

Central to the confiscation hearing will be the mansion, at 33 Portland Place, which he bought for £3.9m from the Sierra Leone government.

Mr Mayo said the prosecution believe the mansion, valued at £10m, was obtained through fraud, whereas Davenport’s legal team will argue it was bought legally.

'Thirty Three Portland Place is a substantial property in central London, the freehold reversion of the premises was bought by Edward Davenport on October 31, 2005, for a total purchase price of £3,937,000’, he said.

‘Has Edward Davenport succeeded in convincing that it was not correct to make the statutory assumption that 33 Portland Place represents proceeds of general criminal conduct?

‘Has Edward Davenport shown there would be a serious risk of injustice if that assumption were made?’

Mr Mayo added both defence and prosecution agree Davenport currently has £14m of assets which are available for confiscation.

The conman’s defence team argue he should repay £8m, and assert that the London mansion should not be part of proceedings.

They will argue £6m should be seized from his Swiss and Monaco bank accounts, just £0.8m in property assets, and £97,000 from a separate property deal.

Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in 1999 for £3.9m while the country was embroiled in civil war

Davenport’s web page boasted: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’

It suggested that Davenport was a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’

Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova, Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne.

One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000 in up-front fees.

She told his trial: ‘He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny.

‘It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common conman. He fully deserves his sentence.’

He turned out in Savile Row suits for his trial, but is now undergoing dialysis treatment three times a week when the court will not sit.

Davenport, of central London was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud.

The confiscation hearing continues.
