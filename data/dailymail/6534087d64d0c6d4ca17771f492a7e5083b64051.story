A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed, scientists say.

They hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease by showing early on whether patients face a deadly threat or can afford to wait and see how their condition progresses.

Much higher levels of the protein, NAALADL2, were found in prostate tumour tissue than in healthy tissue. But the difference was especially marked in aggressive cancers and those already advancing around the body.

Breakthrough: A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed. Scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease

Studies of two independent patient groups confirmed that the protein can be used both to diagnose prostate cancer, and to single out those which need immediate hard-hitting treatment in the form of surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Patients with low levels of the protein were more likely to qualify for ‘watchful waiting’ monitoring, which simply involves keeping a close eye on how the disease progresses.

Older men with very mild forms of prostate cancer are likely to die from other causes before even showing symptoms of the disease, making treatment unnecessary.

Aggressive and tame forms of prostate cancer are popularly known as ‘tigers’ and ‘pussycats’ respectively.

Currently, they are loosely identified by the Gleason score, an aggressiveness rating of one to 10 given to a cancer after a biopsy that involves the removal of prostate tissue.

‘Tigers’ are defined by a Gleason score of eight and above.

NAALADL2 causes prostate cancer cells to behave in an aggressive tiger-like fashion, making them more likely to break out and invade healthy tissue, said the scientists.

While a ‘tiger’ patient’s survival may depend on radical treatment, both surgery and radiotherapy can have serious after-effects, causing lifelong problems such as impotency and urinary incontinence.

Lead scientist Dr Hayley Whitaker, from Cambridge University, said: ‘This is early research, but if clinical trials confirm our results then it could help clinicians to tell which patients have a more aggressive tumour and need proportionally aggressive treatment, while sparing patients with low grade tumours unnecessary radiotherapy or surgery.

‘This is an important step along the path to developing a much-sought after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer.’

Each year around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK and around 11,000 die from the disease.

Professor Malcolm Mason, a prostate cancer expert from Cancer Research UK, which funded the research, said: ‘As a prostate cancer clinician, I have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease.

‘I hope that this research brings forward the day when I can say to patients: “We know that your cancer doesn’t need treatment”- a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects.

‘This extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening, and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future.’

The study, conducted in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, is published in the journal Oncogene.

There are higher levels of the protein NAALADL2 in aggressive tumours

Finding means doctors can identify those tumours that are likely to pose a deadly threat and which need to be tackled with intensive treatment

Currently the aggressiveness of a tumour can only be loosely identified meaning some patients have debilitating treatment that is not necessary
