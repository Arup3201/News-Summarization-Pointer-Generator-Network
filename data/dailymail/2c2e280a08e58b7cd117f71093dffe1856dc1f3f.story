The leader of France’s conservative opposition resigned today after police raided his party’s offices over an alleged multi-million pound funding scandal involving Nicolas Sarkozy. 

In the latest financial controversy to engulf the UMP, Jean-Francois Copé, 50, stepped down as chairman. 

His entire opposition front bench is expected to quit too – ensuring the French right is as discredited as the massively unpopular Socialist government.

In the latest financial controversy to engulf the UMP, Jean-Francois Copé stepped down as chairman of UMP

An event organiser called Bygmalion has accused the UMP of ordering £9m worth of fake invoices to cover overspends during Mr Sarkozy’s 2012 failed re-election campaign. 

The allegation – one in a long list against the controversial Mr Sarkozy – will almost certainly end any hope Mr Sarkozy has of returning to power in 2017.

Judicial police sources confirmed that officers raided the UMP headquarters 'on Monday, in connection with the accusations' – ones that could end up with criminal prosecutions. 

But it is Mr Copé who fell on his sword this morning – principally because Bygmalion is run by two of Copé’s close friends.

A trio of former prime ministers - Alain Juppé, Jean-Pierre Raffarin and François Fillon - will lead the UMP until October, when a permanent replacement will be appointed.

Mr Sarkozy denies any wrong-doing

Patrick Maisonneuve, a lawyer for Bygmalion, said the agency ‘was told’ to issue phony invoices or it wouldn’t be paid for its legitimate work. 

He said the £9m in invoices sent the UMP were fake, and stemmed from work that had been done for Sarkozy.

‘They are real, but they should have been charged to the campaign of presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012,’ said Mr Maisonneuve.

Jerome Lavrilleux, a senior member of UMP, also appeared on live TV to admit there were ‘anomalies’ in Mr Sarkozy’s 2012 accounts.

Mr Lavrilleux was in tears as he told BFM TV channel: ‘There have been anomalies. There was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and I was probably one of them.’

Mr Sarkozy, UMP Chairman Jean-Francois Cope and Batien Millot, the founder of Bygmalion, all deny any wrong-doing.

The home Mr Sarkozy shares in Paris with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, was also raided by anti-corruption officers within a few days of him losing presidential immunity from prosecution in 2012.

He has since been accused of benefitting from millions in illegal cash from a variety of people including former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, and Liliane Bettencourt, France’s richest woman. 

Mr Sarkozy is currently touring with singer Ms Bruni, who performed in Tel Aviv for the first time.

Despite his legal problems, Mr Sarkozy has been a constant critic of Mr Hollande, regularly hinting that he is still capable of winning the presidency again in three years’ time.

The biggest winner from the latest developments will be Marine Le Pen – leader of the far right

National Front.

Her party won a quarter of the vote in the European Parliament elections, and are officially the most popular party in France at the moment. 

In the face of the failure and sleaze of the Socialist government and UMP opposition, she has called for the dissolution of parliament.

Le Pen’s National Front scored a stunning victory, winning 25 per cent of the vote and beating President Francois Hollande’s ruling Socialists into third place.

Miss Le Pen, 45, the daughter of the party’s controversial founder Jean Marie Le Pen said the victory was a ‘massive rejection of the European Union’.

She hailed the ‘historic victory’ in which ‘the sovereign people of France have spoken loud and clear’.

‘The people have taken back the reins of their own destiny,’ she said.

‘This means policies of the French, for the French, by the French. They do not want to be ruled from outside.’
