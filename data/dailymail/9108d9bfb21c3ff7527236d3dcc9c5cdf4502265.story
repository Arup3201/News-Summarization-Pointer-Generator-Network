Residents who one year ago fought vainly to stop flooding destroying their homes have finally returned to Somerset to rebuild their lives, as seen in this remarkable series of pictures illustrating their recovery.

In January and February last year, residents abandoned their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging.

More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest January since records began in 1766.

Now, 12 months on, many of the families caught up in the devastation have moved back into their homes. For many, it comes after painstaking and tiring battles with insurers and builders.

A number of measures have also been taken to ensure the tragedy is not repeated, including the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett, to remove 130,000 cubic meters of silt.

And builder Lee Goddard was fined £1,000 after becoming the first person in Britain to be convicted of opening a sluice gate - after he was found to have opened sluice gates to protect his own property at the height of the floods, sending 45,000 cubic metres of water rushing towards local village Thorney.

Though prosecutors said it could not be confirmed whether Goddard’s actions had directly caused damage to properties in Thorney, he was accused of exacerbating the plight of villagers.

Families forced to flee their waterlogged homes following last winter’s devastating floods on the Levels have finally returned to their properties one year on. On the left, Somerset Levels is pictured as muddy swampland during the February 2014 flooding. Right, it is pictured as it appears today

Resident Mark Corthine wades through his flooded kitchen last year (left), while on the right, he is pictured in the kitchen again today. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were in a similar position after quickly rising waters inundated entire villages

It is only after a year of battles with insurers and builders that many relieved residents are finally able to move back into their homes. Pictured is Mr Corthine wading through waist deep water (left) last year, and standing in the same spot again today (right)

Mr Corthine flashes a smile  as he poses for a photo (right) identical to that taken in his home on February 14 last year (left) - minus the floodwaters. The 63-year-old said: 'We’re back into our house and it is looking good. It’s taken us time, we moved back in pretty much a year to to the day we left'

Last year's flooding, which was the worst on record for the region, meant Mr Corthine needed a boat to travel through his backyard (left). Despite the devastation, he considers himself fortunate. He said: 'The affect it has had on people is absolutely catastrophic. Some people have lost absolutely everything. This will affect some of the local people for a very long time, a very long time indeed.'

These photographs show the main street in Moorland, Somerset, at the height of the flooding (left) and again yesterday (right). Entire villages were cut off during the flooding when roads turned into rivers and became totally unusable

Pictured left, Mark and Kate Kirby comfort each other outside of their devastated home in Moorland last year. Pictured right, how it looks today after repairs. The Kirby family managed to return to their home in March - but were greeted with a home so badly damaged the front door wouldn't even open

Before and after: Moorland Village Hall (pictured) was also flooded - on the left, a car can be seen partially submerged. It's thought the flooding was due, in part, due to years of insufficient dredging of the local rivers

A number of measures have been taken since to ensure the tragedy is not repeated, including the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett to remove 130,000 cubic meters of silt. Pictured is a group of men wading through at a property in Thorney, Somerset on January 25 last year. To the right is the same property pictured as it looks today

Hundreds of families were forced to evacuate their homes and farms and many of them saw their lives work washed away during the tragedy. Pictured left and right is a home in East Lyng, Somerset, which was photographed last year and today respectively

Now following battles with insurers and builders, relieved residents are finally able to move back into their homes and in total £2.8 million has been paid out to farmers in a bid to get them back on track. Pictured is the road between Langport and Muchelney in early January, 2014 (left) and again yesterday (right)

Moorland resident Phil Smithen stands at the front of his home on almost one year on (right) from the floods (left). Farmer Rebecca Horsington, the chair of FLAG (Flooding on the Levels Action Group), lost more than 100 acres of land during the flooding. Now her land has been reclaimed and she has moved home - but she says she still worries about the future
