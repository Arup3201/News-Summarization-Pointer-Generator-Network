Happier times: Beth and Michael Schlesinger on their wedding day, but their marriage has deteriorated and the former couple is in a bitter custody battle

A British woman who married a wealthy Austrian doctor has lost an appeal
for custody of their four year-old twins after a court ruled he is the 
better parent.

Cambridge graduate Beth Schlesinger fell in love with society doctor Michael Schlesinger, but after having sons Samuel and Benjamin their marriage fell apart.

After he was given custody of their boys, the daughter of a successful Manchester solicitor has been fighting the decision for two years but has lost her latest appeal.

She had moved to Vienna to marry him despite protests from her parents and being unable to speak any German.

But, she said, the relationship began to wane after only a week and just eight months later the relationship was over.

She claims he became so controlling he would not even let her go to the toilet at night.

After
they separated and started a custody battle over the children, Dr 
Schlesinger, 33, unsuccessfully attempted to have his wife sectioned.

His
claims that she had a mental illness were dismissed in court, but an 
Austrian judge still took the rare step of giving him sole custody of 
the twins.

Mrs Schlesinger now has visitation rights but can see her sons Samuel and Benjamin for only 20 hours a fortnight.

She
has accused the court of unfairly favouring her ‘well-connected’ 
husband and has appealed to the Austrian high court, which failed today.

She now plans to launch a final appeal with Austria's Supreme Court and claims the her sons have started self-harming.

Bitter dispute: Samuel and Benjamin's case has benefited her estranged husband because he has friendships in the Austrian legal sector, Mrs Schlesinger claims

Still married: Mother of two graduated from Cambridge but gave up her place on a master’s course at a New York university after she fell in love with society doctor Michael Schlesinger, right, but they later split

'There seems to be no justice in this country, that they can 
deprive two little boys of their mother in such a barbaric way,' she said.

'It
contravenes all human rights. Sammy and Benji are two vulnerable little
boys who have a right to their mother in their lives.

'Everybody
involved in the story over here - from lawyers to journalists to social
workers are shocked and outraged at this decision.

'Why the 
Austrian justice system refuses to acknowledge that simple truth is 
beyond me. I only hope that sanity and justice are restored soon.'

The twins: Mrs Schlesinger believes her boys Samuel and Benjamin should be with her, not her husband, but the Austrian courts disagree

Failed relationship: Mrs Schlesinger said the relationship began to wane after only a week and just eight months later the marriage was over

Mrs Schlesinger is still legally married and living in Vienna where 
she feels 'marooned', fearing that by returning to the UK she will lose 
her chance of seeing her twins for good.

She has accused the court of 'xenophobia' and said her husband had benefited from friendships in the Austrian legal sector.

She said: ‘It all seemed very romantic and a big adventure, but the marriage was terrible from the beginning.

‘Looking
back I realise that I never really knew Michael. I was so naive and I 
fell for him as he was very charming and seemed like a caring, 
trustworthy person. I was so wrong.’

Mr Schlesinger, 33, was unavailable for comment.
