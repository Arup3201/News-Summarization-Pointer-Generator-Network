An abandoned pooch that suffered a near fatal neutering was left to bleed outside of a local grocery store, but later rescued by a caring dog lover with a big heart.

Jan Durham of Springfield, Oregon, saved the injured pit bull she now calls Buddy and took him to a nearby animal hospital, KVAL News reports. Durham then paid out of her own pocket for the surgery that saved Buddy’s life.

'He’s really good you know,' Durham told KVAL as she cradled Buddy's head in her lap. 'He’s a great dog. He’s so sweet. He’s smart. He knows how to sit and lay down.'

Saved pooch: Buddy a severely injured pit bull was rescued after being abandoned in front of a local grocery store.

Needed attention: Beth Mitchell, a local animal hospital manager, takes care of Buddy.

Durham, a nearby worker, found Buddy leashed to a shopping cart in front of the

Springfield Safeway, left behind with a bag of dog food and a handwritten sign that read, 'Anything helps.'

The pooch’s wounds were severe, according to the veterinarians who treated Buddy at Q Street Animal Hospital.

Close call: Buddy survived a near fatal DIY neutering.

Life savers: Q Street Animal Hospital, where Buddy was treated.

'They tried to slice the skin open in the scrotal sack to remove the testicle and apparently, when our client brought him in, things were hanging out,' Beth Mitchell, a Q Street Animal Hospital manager, told KVAL. 'He was bloody and it was painful.'

Durham said that she is not angry with whoever left him there.

'At least they loved him enough to leave him in such a public place,' she said.

Durham, who owns a dog, said she will foster Buddy until he finds new owners.

A local pit bull rescue organization, Luv-a-Bull, has agreed to handle Buddy's adoption.

A spokeswoman for the organization, Liesl Hardt, said that Buddy is smart, sweet and good with kids.
