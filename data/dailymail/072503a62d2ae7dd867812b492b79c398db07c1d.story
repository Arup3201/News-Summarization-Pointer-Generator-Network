First there was uproar over news that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos.

Now, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the hides of culled ponies are being crafted into ‘wild pony’ pagan drums – used in Druid-style retreats and musical performances to capture the rhythms of ‘life and the moon’.

Dartmoor ponies are a distinctive, hardy breed, essential to the maintenance of unique moorland landscapes and the rare insects they support.

Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, said the culling scheme was 'a bitter pill to swallow'

But they have been in trouble for years. While they continue to reproduce, the prices they fetch at market have slumped – four ponies recently sold for £1 – and farmers can no longer afford to keep them.

Now, the autumn ‘drifts’ where the ponies are herded down from the hills to market have resulted in culls, with hundreds of unwanted animals – mainly the very young and the old – being slaughtered. Where once 30,000 ponies roamed the moors, there are now believed to be fewer than 1,000 breeding mares.

Conservationists argue it would be more effective to reduce the number of stallions to stifle reproduction, rather than to  slaughter so many animals.

But the controversial zoo programme, set up by Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, claims that selling the meat is a way to raise funds to conserve future herds. 

Now, in addition to the zoo programme, the hides of culled ponies are being used to create hand-crafted drums.

The drums are made by Carolyn Hillyer, a musician and Dartmoor resident, who runs alternative workshops and has been making traditional artisan hand-drums for 15 years, using locally sourced deer skin, and horse hides from America. One of her CDs is titled: ‘Drum Songs From The Heathen Hills’.

Last year, after speaking with Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, who has been battling to save the ponies for more than 16 years, she suggested she could use the hides of the culled ponies to make drums.

‘They are the first wild pony drums to be made in this country for a very long time,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘And we see it as part of a wider regeneration project for the whole region.

‘It’s a sensitive project and it’s taken a year to get to this stage, as I have been working with other people in the community. But the ethos behind it is that nothing is wasted.

As far as we know, this is the first time this has been done in this country.’

Charlotte Faulkner said the culling scheme at first ‘seemed like swallowing a bitter pill’. 

‘We had reached the desperate situation where there was nowhere for these unwanted ponies to go. It was breaking my heart,’ she said. ‘It was difficult.

First using the ponies for zoo meat, then using their hides. We don’t want to be shooting ponies and feeding them to lions. But the ponies face such a dire situation.

And with this, we are protecting the herds, and the moors. And nothing is being wasted. Carolyn has made three of the pony drums so far and has given me one.

It has the most amazing deep fur hide, is a sort of a stone colour, and has a very resonant sound.

‘I see the drums as a symbol of the ponies’ voices … calling you to listen to their cry for support to help them continue looking after Dartmoor.’

Journalist Sybil Ruscoe visited Dartmoor and followed the journey of the ponies from their slaughter, with bolt guns, to the zoo feeding, and the drum making process, for BBC Radio 4’s On The Farm. She describes the resulting 25-minute programme as ‘a hard listen’ – a far cry from the 1930s, when there were said to be 30,000 ponies on the moors.

But the demand for the ponies at market has been falling – particularly since the recession. 

The animal welfare lobby has argued the problem could be remedied by removing stallions. But local conservationists say stallions are essential for holding a herd together.

‘What we are doing sits within the conservation of our heritage,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘We want to encourage people to support the care of these ponies and the drums are a way of doing this.’

But a spokesman for PETA, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, said culling was ‘a cruel and ineffective way to manage pony numbers when chemical sterilisers are available’.

He added: ‘That the slaughtered carcasses of these much loved animals are being turned into musical instruments or slabs of meat for depressed tigers in Devon’s zoos is the final indignity.’
