The Queen's cousin is calling for new laws forcing supermarkets to sell only food after blaming the closure of his 174-year-old hardware store on the opening of an Asda.

The Earl of Strathmore - whose family seat is Glamis Castle, the birthplace of the Queen Mother - said he was 'deeply saddened' that his ironmongery shop was to shut later this month.

He said Angus council bears 'much of the blame' for the closure for allowing the construction of an Asda supermarket nearby, along with other discount retailers in the town.

The Earl bought the shop David Irons & Sons in Forfar, Angus, in 2005 from Marshall and Michael Irons, whose great-grandfather, George, established the business in 1840.

The Earl's third wife, Karen Baxter, whom he married in 2012, was the manager of the store.

In a statement, he said: 'An array of factors have built up against us in the past eight years.

'Firstly, the inextricable rise of the internet, which I can only see going one way and that is ever upwards.

'Secondly, over the past 18 months, we have had severe staffing issues within the shop.

'Thirdly, I’m afraid much of the blame must be laid at the council’s doorstep, with the arrival of Asda and three large discount stores within the small town of Forfar.

'With the cost of renovations carried out due to fire regulations and increasing overheads, plus all the above factors taken into consideration, it is quite impossible to continue trading.'

He later told the Daily Telegraph: 
'Every supermarket that arrives selling all sorts of things is bound to 
make an impact on local independents.

'In
 my humble view, supermarkets should be for selling food and nothing 
else. They are just killing off the centre of these old towns.'

After buying the business, the Earl said he wanted to keep the distinct charm of ironmongery, characterised famously in 'Four Candles' comedy sketch by the Two Ronnies.

Now he is saddened that the store’s remarkable run must come to an end.

He added: 'I realise that Forfar will lose one of its iconic retail shops and my wife and I are deeply saddened having come to this decision.'

The Earl, who is one of Scotland’s richest landowners, married the current Countess of Strathmore after acquiring David Irons & Sons, where she worked.

The couple married in a low-key ceremony at his historic £12million seat - the childhood home of the late Queen Mother - watched by close family and friends.

The shop, which has a provisional closing date of June 27, sells a wide range of goods, from hardware and household electrical items to tableware and decorative items.

It passed on through five generations of the Irons family before it was sold to the Earl of Strathmore.

George Irons formed a partnership with his cousin to open the ironmongers business in 1840, but the partnership dissolved after 10 years and the shop was carried on by George until his death in 1872.

His son, David Irons Sr continued the business before passing it on to his sons William and David Irons Jr.

Upon the death of David Irons Jr, the business passed to his son William and then to his sons Michael and Marshall.

The store still has a water-operated lift, installed in 1908, which is still in working order today.

Forfar councillor Colin Brown said he was 'shocked' to hear the news of the historic retailer’s closure.He said: 'I’ve used the shop for probably 50 years.

'Irons always had whatever you needed and I know farmers in the area used to rely on it heavily.'It’s a real shame it’s closing.'

David Hutcheson, a committee member of the Tayside branch of business group Institute of Directors, said: 'It is a real shame that when a company with so much history ceases to trade.

'Shops like Irons provide goods you can’t get form the big companies. The problem is, with the growth of the internet, people who want to shop online will do it.

'Small shops have to find some way of adapting to the internet, or offering a personal service that people can’t get online.'

Angus council declined to comment.
