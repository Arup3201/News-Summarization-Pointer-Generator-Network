Zumba prostitute Alexis Wright has been released from jail after serving nearly six months behind bars - bringing to a close a scandal featuring sex videos, adultery and a client list with more than 100 names.

Wright, 30, admitted to running a prostitution business from her fitness studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine. She also confessed to tax evasion and conspiracy charges.

She walked out of the York County Jail Saturday morning wearing a gray suit and clutching a stack of folders.

Asked about her time in jail she said, 'I have no comment.'

She then stepped into a waiting sport utility vehicle driven by her husband, Jason Trowbridge.

Trowbridge has stuck by his wife and the mother of his young son, despite allegations that she had sex with more than 100 men - and one woman - for money.

Wright served nearly six months in jail and was released early for good behavior

Wright served six months of a 10-month sentence after she received credit for good behavior and participating in a work program.

The scandal erupted a year ago in an unlikely place, a small town known for its beaches, New England charm and proximity to former President George H.W. Bush's seaside estate in Kennebunkport.

Wright's prostitution business came as a surprise to her fitness clients but not to police officers who'd become suspicious after fielding complaints about groaning, loud music and men coming and going from an office Wright rented across the street from her studio.

According to police, her business partner, Mark Strong of Thomaston, watched the sexual encounters unfold in real time on a computer in his insurance business office. In a twist at her sentencing,

Wright divulged that she believed her business partner had tricked her into believing she was a secret operative investigating sexual deviance.

Co-conspirator: Mark W. Strong was accused of being Wright's business partner and helping to organize the prostitution business. He served 20 days in jail

Prosecutors didn't buy Wright's story, saying investigators continue to believe the 30-year-old Wright was "a willing participant" in the prostitution business.

Detailed records over an 18-month period indicated Wright made $150,000 tax-free. She also collected more than $40,000 in public assistance, prosecutors said.

Strong, a 58-year-old married father of two, acknowledged having an affair with Wright and helping her start the fitness studio but said he didn't profit from the prostitution. He was convicted of 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail.
