Feeling the pressure to look good naked: The average British man will now spend £46.79 on beauty treatments to prepare for their first night of passion with a new partner

For modern men it takes a lot more than a comb of the hair and a clean shirt to make them feel prepared for a date.

In fact, according to a survey carried out by msn.co.uk they are now spending more on beauty treatments than women to ensure they look their best.

The poll of 2,000 Brits found that British men fork out an average of £46.79 on treatments including haircuts, back and pubic hair waxing, and even facials.

They are most likely to spend this amount on a date which they expect to end in the bedroom.

Women on the other hand spend an 
average of £41.79 on things like hair removal, new bed linen and 
lingerie if they believe sex is on the cards with a new man.

More than half (55 per cent) said they 
make the investment ahead of an anticipated first night of passion because it makes them feel confident and 23 per cent
 believe society puts pressure on them to look good naked.

Msn.co.uk relationship expert Dr Pam 
Spurr said: 'It's fascinating that men are spending more on pre-date 
preparation than women, but I do hear from many men that they feel the 
pressure to impress their dates.'

She added: 'It might also seem 
surprising in times of recession that the average Brit bloke spends 
nearly £50 simply getting ready for a 'hot date', with women not too far
 behind. But there is enormous competition out there and so 
psychologically it makes a singleton feel ready to put their best foot 
forward.'

Your place or mine? On average, men think the first night of passion should be after the third date but the majority of women want to wait till at least the fifth

The research found that men and women differ on when they think is the best time to have sex with a new partner.

The majority of men believed three 
dates was enough before slipping between the sheets while women said 
they would want to wait till they've had least five dates.

Both men and women agreed personality and self-confidence were turn ons but dirty sheets were a turn off.

Men were particularly turned off by untamed body hair - such as facial hair or hairy legs - while women didn't like a man who was unshaved or in a bad outfit.

Being more specific on what they found attractive about intimate areas, nearly half of the men (42 per cent) said they liked it is a woman had a 'Brazilian' while 34 per cent prefered a trim of the bikini line. Just one per cent said they liked vajazzling - the decorating of a woman's parts made famous by TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

Meanwhile, nearly of the women, 45 per cent, said they liked a man to be 'ungroomed and very hairy' 'downstairs' while 38 per cent prefered them to be neatly trimmed. Just six per cent were attracted by the 'Columbian' (a full genital wax).
