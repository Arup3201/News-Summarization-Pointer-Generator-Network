A former Premier League footballer tested positive for cocaine, yet only received a two month suspension, it was revealed tonight.

In a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, ex-Birmingham City striker Gary O’Connor was revealed to have tested positive for the drug during the 2009/10 season.

The programme also unveiled a cover up by both the club and the FA after former manager Alex Mcleish said that the striker was out injured.

Mcleish said that he had had a reaction to an operation the previous year so would miss three or four months of action.

Neither O’Connor, Mcleish or Birmingham City would comment on the allegations.

The programme, who obtained a secret document, also named several players as having tested positive over the past eight years.

They included Elvis Hammond, a former Fulham player who now plays for a lower league club, who tested positive in September 2003. He was banned for six months.

The programme also named Rochdale player Lee Thorpe, while specifying that unnamed players from Everton, Nottingham Forest and Tranmere have also tested positive.

The investigation also uncovered widespread discrepancies in the bans given to players who had been found with the drug in their system.

It found that footballer’s ban was dependent on when the offence occurred; with Roman Bednar of  West Bromwich receiving a three month ban as he was not caught on a match day.

However Shaun Newton, a West Ham player, who was caught following a game, received just seven months. In many other sports he would have received a two year ban.

Dispatches found that the UK anti-doping agency have caught up to 43 professional footballers using cocaine, ecstasy or cannabis in out-of-competition testing.

The programme also discussed 240 ‘abandoned’ tests between April 2007 and August 2010.

This is when testers arrive at training grounds to discover that the players targeted were not there.

It found that Portsmouth had been involved in eight abandoned tests, while Swansea were involved in 15 and Scunthorpe 12.

The FA has said it will wait until the programme has finished until responding but it is understood officials were disappointed because they consider their testing to be more extensive
 than in any other sport in the country.

In
 a statement to Dispatches, the FA said: ‘The FA operates a 
comprehensive anti-doping programme which is the largest of any sport in
 the UK. The FA go beyond the WADA Code by proactively testing all 
samples for social drugs, irrespective of whether the tests are 
conducted in or out of competition.’

Exposé: The document revealed that  43 professional footballers have been caught using cocaine, ecstasy or cannabis in out-of-competition testing

Football
 pays for more than 60 per cent of tests on athletes in the UK, and 
their policy of protecting the identity of players who fail 
out-of-competition tests for recreational drugs is not in breach of any 
World Anti-Doping Agency regulations. WADA don’t even demand that 
athletes are tested out of competition for recreational drugs.

Those
 who fail tests for these sorts of drugs in competition are named by the
 FA.

But the policy of protecting those exposed this evening - the FA 
consider it better to treat and educate them privately - is questioned 
by the head of WADA, David Howman.

Asked
 whether the FA should disclose how many players are tested or how many 
tests take place, he replied: ‘The answer to that is why not? If you 
don’t then you are susceptible to an allegation that you’re hiding 
something.

‘They’re 
saying they haven’t got a doping problem because there are not many 
positive tests. I think the answer to that is: don’t we need to conduct 
better research to see what the prevalence of doping is? Until we are 
satisfied by the use of all the gathering of evidence I don’t think 
we’re in a position to say (there is not a drug problem in English 
football).’
