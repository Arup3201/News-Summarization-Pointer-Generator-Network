Cranes have nested in southern England for the first time in 400 years – after a group of conservationists  dressed as giant birds to show them how to do it.

The common crane, as its name suggests, was once widespread in Britain, but came close to extinction around 1600 from overhunting and their wetlands habitat being drained.

But now, after being raised from eggs at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust base in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, four birds have built their own nest on the Severn estuary.

Growing up: Two of the cranes learn to fly at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire

Unusual techniques: The chicks at the center learning to fly, with two members of staff dressed in crane suits running along side to get them airbourne

Nature, however, needed a bit of a helping hand, as the birds had none of their own species around to teach them the necessary skills to survive in the wild.

So staff at the WWT disguised themselves in custom-made crane suits and spent almost every day for 12 weeks with the birds.

The young cranes were taught how to forage for food and avoid predators.

Human interaction without the crane suits was limited to ensure the birds did not lose their innate fear of people, as this could make them vulnerable in the wild.

And the plan seems to have worked, as the birds finally made their new homes by the water.

As part of the Great Crane Project, supported by the WWT, it is hoped 100 cranes will have been released into the Somerset Levels by 2015.

This should help secure the birds’ future by achieving a sustainable population in the UK.

Great Crane Project aviculturist Amy King, one of those who dressed as an adult crane to teach the birds, said: ‘This beautiful bird was so iconic to Britain yet it was almost wiped out by hunting and the draining of our wetlands.

They're back: The common crane, as its name suggests, was once widespread in Britain, but came close to extinction around 1600 from overhunting and their wetlands habitat being drained

‘It may come to nothing, but this is an amazing moment seeing their first nest-building attempt in this part of the world for 400 years.

'It’s even more exciting knowing these are some of the birds we taught by hand to survive by themselves. I feel like a very proud parent.’

A small group of cranes has been established on a reserve in East Anglia since 1979, but it is hoped this latest milestone will enable the birds to flourish on their own and eventually become a common sight in Britain’s wetland areas once again.
