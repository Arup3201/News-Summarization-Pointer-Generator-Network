Security forces in Delhi have been placed on high alert after receiving warnings of a possible terrorist attack on the metro system.

Security has been doubled across crowded areas of the underground rail network with passengers being frisked on entry and their baggage searched.

The Islamic Terrorist group Indian Mujahideen is understood to have threatened a Mumbai-style attack some time during the first 10 days of 2014.

All passengers on the Delhi Metro network are being frisked and their baggage searched, authorities say

On November 26, 2008 12 gunmen went on a shooting and bombing spree across Mumbai which left 166 people dead.

Foreign travellers are being advised to remain vigilant and comply with the demands of local authorities.

India's Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has been increasing the working hours of its 5,000 staff working across Delhi's 140 Metro stations.

A spokesman told the Hindustan Times: 'We have personnel working in three shifts. Their eight-hour shifts have been increased to 10 hours so that we have more hands at any given point.

'The alert talks about the possibility of a Mumbai-type attack on Delhi Metro.

'We are concentrating mainly on the outside security because it is impossible for someone to carry a weapon beyond the check-point.

'We already have 100 per cent frisking and baggage screening in place. Now, the guards have been asked to pat down suspicious passengers'.

An additional threat has been received of a possible hijack attempt at Delhi Airport.

It is believed the Indian Mujahideen may be trying to secure the release of its leader Yasin Bhatkal who was arrested in August 2013.

Extra Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs), bomb disposal experts and dog teams have been placed on standby with security increased at the most busy stations including Ashok Park Main, Inderlok, Kirti Nagar, Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate and Central Secretariat.

Over two million passengers use the Delhi Metro every day.

Indian Mujahideen, which is believed to be linked to the Pakistan-based group Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba, has carried out a string of attacks since 2007.
