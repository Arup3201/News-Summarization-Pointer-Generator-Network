Samoa Air has started to charge passengers for a plane seat according to how much they weigh.

Under the new model passengers pay a fixed price per kilogram for the ticket price, which varies depending on the route length.

Head of Samoa Air Chris Langton told Australia's ABC Radio that it was 'the fairest way of travelling.'

New plans: Samoa Air has started to charge passengers according to how much they weigh

Under the pay by weight system passengers input their weight into the 
online booking section of the Samoa Air website.

Air Samoa's rates range from $1 (65p) to around $4.16 per kilogram reported News.com.au.

'People have always travelled on the basis of their seat but as many airline operators know airlines don't run on seats they run on weight and particularly the smaller the aircraft you are in the less variance you can accept in terms of the difference in weight between passengers,' Mr Langton told ABC radio.

Mr Langton said that families with children were now paying cheaper fares.

'There are no extra fees in terms of excess baggage or anything - it is just a kilo is a kilo is a kilo,' he said

Passengers can also add their baggage weight on - there  are no separate fees because of excess baggage. 

Samoa Air flies domestically and to American Samoa - it is thought the move could encourage other airlines to introduce similar policies.

Airline seats are literally growing with demand and last year Airbus announced  that it will be providing extra-wide seats for overweight passengers as number of obese passengers creeps up.

One third of the population are currently obese, with the figure expected to reach 42 per cent by 2030.

Two 20-inch seats will be installed on each side of the aisle, sacrificing the space for three regular 18-inch seats on board the A320 - on Boeing aircraft standard seats are 17 inches.

Extra-large passengers will be able to purchase extra-large seats at an added cost, which will likely prove lucrative to the air travel industry.

Airlines could make as much as $3 million extra in profits over a 15-year period, according to the Huffington Post.
