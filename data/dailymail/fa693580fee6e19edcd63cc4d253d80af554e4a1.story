Nick Clegg was last night accused of being at the centre of a ‘Coalition cover-up’ over bombshell emails that reveal how he helped to fast-track £12 million of taxpayers’ money to a charity linked to his wife.

A watchdog, acting on the advice of a Cabinet Minister, has banned the release of all correspondence relating to the Booktrust case on the grounds that it would have a ‘chilling effect’ on the Government.

The ban – condemned by one of the Deputy Prime Minister’s own Liberal Democrat MPs – follows a year-long drive by the Cabinet Office to suppress details of how one of Mr Clegg’s advisers successfully lobbied for Booktrust to receive automatic funding, rather than having to bid against other charities.

Nick Clegg (pictured with his wife Miriam) was accused of 'covering up' emails which revealed how he helped to fast track £12million to a charity linked to his wife

The £12 million award came shortly after Miriam Clegg had hosted a lavish reception for the charity – which promotes reading – a fact mentioned by Mr Clegg’s aide Matt Sanders during the lobbying process.

It led to angry exchanges within Whitehall after mandarins argued that abandoning procedures to favour the charity was unfair.

Now, after a battle by this newspaper to see the emails under Freedom of Information legislation, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham has ruled that they should be kept secret. He said that after reading the ‘candid and frank’ emails he had concluded their disclosure ‘would be likely to prejudice the conduct of Government’.

The ban was even condemned by the Deputy Prime Minister's own Liberal Democrat MPs

In his ruling, Mr Graham, advised by Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, admitted there was ‘a public interest in the processes that lead to such decisions being transparent’ because the funding decision ‘may have an effect on the educational opportunities for children’.

Significantly, he added: ‘The public interest in ensuring such transparency  in this case is increased given the specific circumstances of this case which the [Mail on Sunday] has highlighted .  .  . there is genuine public interest in the disclosure of information which would inform the public as to whether or not there has been any impropriety in the awarding of these funds.’

But he decided this was overridden by the need for Ministers to be ‘able to inform themselves about how the implementation of Government policy might affect the Government as a whole’, adding that this ‘was particularly important for the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister who must have an overview of the Government’s activities’.

He concluded: ‘The withheld information contains candid and frank exchanges that were clearly conducted with the expectation that they would be treated confidentially.’

This led him to conclude: ‘Disclosure of the withheld information would have been likely to result in a chilling effect and thus potentially inhibit the contributions of individuals when providing advice to other departments.’

Last night, Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘Where public money is involved I think there should be a clear audit trail, and I am surprised that they did not release, at the very least, a few redacted emails.

‘They seem to have taken a Trappist vow of silence. We should know how decisions such as these are made now, not have to wait 30 years for the release of Government papers.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This looks a lot like a Coalition cover-up – Mr Maude protecting his new friends in the Lib Dems. If they had wanted to disprove any allegations of impropriety, they could have released a section of the emails to rebut that charge without jeopardising either officials’ identities or the confidentiality of Government business.’

Mr Clegg’s office maintains that the decision on Booktrust’s funding was taken ‘in an entirely proper way by the Secretary of State for Education’. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Booktrust.

A Cabinet Office spokesman  said: ‘There is no question of any undue influence or pressure being brought to bear by the Deputy  Prime Minister.’
