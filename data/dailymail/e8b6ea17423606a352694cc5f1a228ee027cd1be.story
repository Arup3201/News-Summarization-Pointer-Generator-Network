He's the hunting aficionado son of a rock star, better known for getting arrested after storming the House of Commons than for his sense of style.

But it seems that Otis Ferry is more fashionable than anyone ever realised as these pictures from his new campaign for leather goods brand, Noble Macmillan, prove.

And not content with simply posing for photos, Ferry has also turned his hand to design and has produced a range of chic leather notebooks for the British brand.

Although this is the 30-year-old's first foray into design, he's no stranger to the world of fashion thanks to his girlfriend - the aristocratic model, Edie Campbell.

Once described by society magazine Tatler as the real life version of Jilly Cooper's notorious cad Rupert Campbell-Black, the Old Marlburian has dated a string of beautiful women including Mancunian supermodel Agyness Deyn.

His collection for Noble Macmillan includes a leather bound fishing book and a similarly covered gamekeeper's log book.

Ferry said: 'I worked with Noble 
Macmillan on their game and fishing books so I love those as they have a
little bit of me in them. I also love their photo albums. They make the
most wonderful presents.

'I thought [Noble Macmillan] products
resonate with my hobbies and love for the outdoors. They are stylish 
and timeless so a collaboration seemed like the perfect match

A spokesman for Noble Macmillan, added: ’We are extremely proud to have Otis as our Brand
Ambassador.

Perfect fit: According to Noble Macmillan, Otis Ferry is the quintessential English gentleman

'Otis 
represents the classic British gentleman, whose passion for the great 
British countryside combined with his urban edge, fits perfectly with 
the our brand image.'

Despite his stylish other half, Ferry is more often to be found at home in Shropshire, where he indulges in his favourite country pursuits and is the joint master of the South Shropshire hunt.

'I love the fresh air and the open space,' he revealed in an interview published on the Noble Macmillan blog.

Ferry, whose stepfather is Robin Birley - the eldest son of Lady Annabel Goldsmith - also revealed that despite his hell-raising reputation, he now prefers to spend his evenings with family when in London.

'I spend a lot of time at my step-father’s new private club [Mayfair's 5, Hertford Street] in the West End,' he said.

'It has a very welcoming feel and the décor and design feel like you’re in a country house so it feels like a home from home.'
