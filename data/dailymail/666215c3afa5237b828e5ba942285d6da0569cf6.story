The Van Gaal/Mourinho love-in made me sick

In 25 years covering football at all levels, from way down the pyramid to the World Cup final, I don’t think I have ever come across a footballer more determined and passionate about playing for England than Saido Berahino - and he’s got special reason as well.

Berahino’s back story is well-known, but let me briefly fill you in. Born in Burundi, his mother fled the war-torn country after his father had died. She made her way to England, 10-year-old Saido arrived here alone some time after.

There was a lot of red-tape, but mother and son were eventually allowed to live in the same home in Birmingham, and young Berahino started playing football and learning English.

He says that this is when his life finally started.

What England did for Berahino and his family is constantly running through his heart and head. Forget the fact he wasn’t born in England – he oozes more passion for this country than he could if he was born in Buckingham Palace with a plate of fish and chips in one hand, a Union Jack in the other, and whistling the theme tune to Coronation Street.

This is what he said when I asked him what playing for England would mean to him: 'It would mean the world to me as England have given me a second chance to have a better life for me and my family.'

I’m not one of those who think most England players aren’t passionate about representing their country. I’ve always thought that is a lazy accusation. Some people study whether the players sing the national anthem – I’m not interested in that stuff to be honest, despite the fact I’m a true England fan.

I care about how they play, but more importantly I care about their willingness to play. At every level from England Under 16 upwards, Berahino has always willingly turned up, when so many others cried off.

Even when heavily tipped to move up to the senior squad, Berahino accepted that he was staying in the Under 21s and went out and performed to the best of his ability.

I doubt you care much about England if you’ve read this and not felt keen to see the West Brom striker wear the Three Lions on his shirt.

You want passion with England? You want someone who cares about this country? You want someone who feels they owe it to this country to give his very, very best and more? Then let’s get Berahino into the England squad as soon as possible please.

I haven’t even mentioned how good a footballer he is – the goals speak for themselves.

But I watched him carefully against Crystal Palace on Saturday and it’s fair to say he didn’t have his best game, but he still contributed two key moments.

West Brom were trailing 2-0 at The Hawthorns when Berahino started a move on the left. He picked up the ball on the edge of the area and curled a terrific shot towards the far corner, only to see it superbly tipped behind by Julian Speroni.

This was five minutes into the second half, and it got the Baggies going, it woke them up and West Brom scored from the subsequent corner.

Berahino also kept his cool to score the penalty deep into added time that gave West Brom a point.

There are strikers getting in the England squad who don’t even play, let alone score.

At West Bromwich Albion you have a committed and very good young striker in the form of his life who is passionate about playing for England.

It’s a no-brainer.

Do the decent thing, Roy.
