A retired civil servant strangled his long-term partner before hanging himself over the Christmas holiday.

Judith Brierley, 67, was found dead in the bedroom of the home she had shared with Kim Matthews, 62, by concerned relatives.

The body of Mr Matthews, who ran a local allotment association, was hanging from the bannister in their terraced house Ealing, West London.

The horror was uncovered by Mr Matthews’ brother who broke into the £550,000 property when he could not reach the devoted couple by phone.

Concern: Police were called to this leafy Ealing cul de sac after concerned relatives failed to hear from the couple over Christmas

Detectives said there is no evidence 
that anyone else was involved in the murder of Mrs Brierley at the home 
the couple had shared for more than 30 years.

It is understood that the childless 
couple both suffered from depression and the tragedy may have taken 
place shortly before Christmas.

Neighbours in the quiet residential 
street described the couple, both retired civil servants, as ‘joined at 
the hip’ and said they ‘lived for each other’.

One said they always handed out Christmas cards on December 24 but came around early this year for the first time.

She said: ‘We got our Christmas cards 
from Kim and Judith early this year. Usually they deliver it on 
Christmas Eve but this year they delivered it around the first week of 
December.

‘A lot of the neighbours remarked upon
it. Now I wonder what that meant. My heart just goes out to their 
family and the neighbours. We are a very close knit community.’

Describing how the tragedy was 
discovered on Friday, one said Mr Matthews’ brother and son broke into 
the house after failing to reach the couple by telephone.

He said: ‘I went over and spoke to the
nephew who had come with his dad. I asked if they were OK and he said, 
'No, it is a suicide.’

‘I said are you sure and he said yes, 
he is hanging from the banisters. I asked where Judith was and he said 
she was in the house too. They were absolutely devastated.

‘Kim's brother said he hadn't been able to contact them for two days before Christmas Eve, he was quite concerned about them.

‘He was adamant they were in the house, he wasn't going to go away until he had got into that house.

‘It was dreadful to hear that door break and know what happened. I can't take my eyes off the house, it is so sad.’

Residents said the couple were extremely private but always said hello when were often seen out walking together.

Another neighbour said: ‘They were 
just a lovely couple, they were obviously very devoted to each other. 
They were a bit like loners – they lived for each other.

‘It is so sad to hear about their deaths, I haven't slept since I heard the news.’

A post mortem examination found Mrs 
Brierley was strangled with a ligature. There were no suspicious 
circumstances around Mr Matthews death.

Det Chief Insp Matt Bonner, who is leading the inquiry, said there is no evidence that anyone else was involved.

He said: ‘While we continue to keep an
open mind in relation to this investigation, we believe this to be an 
isolated incident with no third party involvement.

‘I would like to express my condolences to the families of Kim and Judith at this very sad time.’
