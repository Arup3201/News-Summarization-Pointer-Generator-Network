Imagine every Manchester United player is fit and in form (yes, we know it takes some imagining)… Do we know Louis van Gaal’s preferred starting XI? Does the Dutchman?

United have already used more players this term – 35 – than David Moyes and Ryan Giggs did across the whole of last season. And on Saturday they go into a crunch match at Arsenal with injury doubts over at least 13 first-team players.

Here, three of our men in the north-west – Ian Ladyman, Simon Jones and Joe Bernstein - pick their United first XIs… and each of them is vastly different from the team Van Gaal will field on Saturday night at the Emirates. Don’t forget to name your Red Devils’ first team using the comments section at the bottom of this article or, alternatively, tweet us @MailSport…
