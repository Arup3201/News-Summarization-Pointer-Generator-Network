Mike Smith, the former BBC Radio 1 DJ and broadcaster, has died at the age of 59.

Smith, who was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1980s, died on Friday after complications arising from major heart surgery.

The presenter, who had been married to fellow broadcaster Sarah Greene for 25 years, presented Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988.

During his two-year tenure on the programme, he was described by Princess Diana as her favourite DJ.

Mike Smith, former Radio 1 presenter, has died aged 59 from complications following heart surgery. Smith began at the BBC in 1975 and taking over the breakfast show in 1986 (pictured in 2008, left, and 1984, right)

Known for his boyish good looks and affectionately dubbed ‘Smitty’, Smith also proved popular with TV audiences and was a regular on Top of the Pops.

In addition, he made frequent appearances on the BBC’s Breakfast Time programme and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, hosted by Noel Edmonds.

His experience as a live broadcaster and his knowledge of popular music meant he was an ideal choice as a host of the BBC’s Live Aid broadcast in 1985. He managed to remain cool and calm even when a highly emotional Bob Geldof swore on air as he tried raise more money for African famine relief. 

Aside from his broadcasting career, Smith was a keen motorsports enthusiast, building his own cars and competing in a racing career that began when he was just 14.

Disaster struck in 1988 when Smith, a qualified pilot, and Greene, who was his girlfriend at the time, were injured when the helicopter he was piloting crashed in Gloucestershire. Greene broke both her legs and an arm and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle. Smith proposed just weeks later and they were married the following year.

Sarah Greene last night asked that she and her family and friends be allowed to mourn in peace.

In a statement, she offered enormous thanks to the staff at the hospital in which her husband died for their care and compassion.

Fellow Breakfast Show alumnus Mike Read was among the first to pay tribute to ‘affable, businesslike’ Smith last night. The DJ and television personality said: ‘The news is just devastating. Sarah and Mike were a wonderful couple – it is truly horrible to hear.

‘I knew Mike as there were only five of us to have presented the Breakfast Show at that time.

‘He became a mainstay of Radio 1, was highly successful on television too, and started up his own business, which he was very good at. I worked with Sarah for a number of years, including around the time of the crash, so I was very fond of them both. The helicopter crash was really bad but they just got on with it and married.

‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’

Other friends and colleagues paid tribute on social networking sites such as Twitter.

Phillip Schofield, who presented the flagship children’s television show Going Live with Greene, said: ‘There are no words. My wonderful, bright, funny, thoughtful friend Mike Smith has passed. I’m so sorry, my darling Sarah.’

Radio presenter Simon Mayo wrote: ‘Shocked to hear of Mike Smith’s death today. Condolences to Sarah and all his family.’

Simon Mayo, fellow BBC Radio 1 presenter who took over from Smith after he left the breakfast show in 1988, has tweeted his sympathies this evening

Philip Schofield has also taken to social media to pay his respects to Smith who died yesterday in hospital 

Keith Chegwin paid tribute to ‘a nice man and a great broadcaster’ who died ‘far too young’.

Towards the end of his life Smith concentrated on his career as a pilot and aerial photographer. In 2004 he founded Flying TV, a company set up to provide aerial filming services to broadcasters.

He did, however, continue to make occasional appearances on television and radio, and in 2012 he and Greene appeared in an edition of the BBC1 quiz show Pointless.

The star was never afraid to speak his mind and recently criticised Radio 1’s music strategy and what he saw as its obsession with youth.

He said: ‘They say they’re going for a younger audience – that’s just wrong. Relentlessly chasing youth is going to p*** off more people than it will attract.

‘I don’t know why the BBC is slavishly following demographics invented by advertisers when they don’t take advertising.

‘Chasing demographics is terrible news for listeners.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are saddened to hear of Mike’s passing. He was a talented presenter and a brilliant Radio 1 Breakfast Show host and our thoughts are with his family.’

Born in Hornchurch, Essex, in 1955, Mike Smith began his presenting career on hospital radio at nearby Chemsford Hospital.

In 1975 he moved to the BBC for the first time where he worked as a freelance producer and presenter on Radio 1, before moving to Capital Radio in 1978 where he became a breakfast presenter.

He moved back to BBC Radio in 1982 where he presented the early show from 6-7 in the morning until 1983 when he was moved to the lunchtime slot.

In 1986 'Smitty' - as he was then known by listeners - took over from Mike Read to present the breakfast show, a role which he held until deciding to leave the company in 1988.

Smith went to to present programmes such as That's Showbusiness and Julian Clarey's Trick Or Treat. He was one of BBC TV's presenters at Live Aid in 1985, helped found Comic Relief and presented several of the TV shows.

A keen helicopter pilot, Smith had a major accident in 1988 when he crashed a helicopter while future wife Sarah Greene was riding with him.

Ms Greene broke both legs and an arm, and Smith suffered a broken back and ankle.

Despite the accident Smith proposed to Ms Greene just a few weeks later, and the pair got married the following year.

In 2003 Smith founded TV production company Flying TV, putting his training as a pilot to good use by providing specialist aerial shots for various shows including BBC coverage of the Boat Race and Formula 1, Top Gear, BBC News, ITV News and Channel 4 News.

Smith was also fond of car racing, starting as an amateur while still in school and eventually founding his own team of Ford RS500s, winning the Championship in 1990.
