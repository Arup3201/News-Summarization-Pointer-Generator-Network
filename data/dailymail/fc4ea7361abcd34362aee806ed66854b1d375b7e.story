Mohamed Salah sent out a message to parent club Chelsea after scoring twice in a 2-1 win against Juventus to take his goal tally at Fiorentina to six in seven matches.

The Egyptian's brace in Turin earned his side a slender lead to take into the second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final and condemned Juventus to their first home defeat in 48 matches.

Salah scored his first 11 minutes in when he sprinted past three defenders and dribbled for 60 yards before launching in a shot from inside the area.

FIORENTINA: Seven appearances, six goals.

EGYPT: 35 appearances, 20 goals. 

Fernando Llorente then equalised with a superb header in the 24th minute, but Salah scored the winner in the second half with an angled shot inside the box.

Since moving to Italy on loan, Salah has scored three goals in Serie A, one in the Europa League against Tottenham, and two in the Coppa Italia.

The Egyptian was used as a bargaining tool in Jose Mourinho's deal to bring Juan Cuadrado from Florence to London but has already outshone the Colombian, who is yet to score in five appearances for Chelsea. 

Blues midfielder Eden Hazard was clearly impressed with Salah's performance, tweeting after the game: 'Momo Salah on fire.'

Lazio and Napoli drew 1-1 in the other semi-final on Wednesday. The return legs will be played on April 7 and 8.

Micah Richards posted this online after the game and said: 'Great win from the boys tonight!'
