As a Paddington Bear lookalike, perhaps it's no surprise that this giant tried to find his very own Paddington Station to call home.

But without a cute blue duffle coat and a rain hat, the huge mammal cuts a slightly more daunting figure than its fictional counterpart.

The brown bear charged at a railway station's windows, displaying its huge claws as it tried to find a way in.

The curious animal is thought to have been attracted by the smell of food, perhaps even a batch of marmalade sandwiches, Paddington Bear 's favourite snack.

Hungry: Like Paddington Bear, who had a liking for marmalade sandwiches, the bear most likely tried to break in as it could smell food

While Paddington Bear himself famously made his way to England from 'Darkest Peru', this bear was from just as exotic a location.

The brown bear is pictured trying to break into a station in rural Russia, thought to be located in Tarbinskaya, Krasnoyarsk region.

In the first story Paddington Bear 
story, written by Michael Bond, the bear is discovered at London's 
Paddington Railway Station by the Brown family.

A note attached to his coat reads: 'Please look after this bear. Thank you.'

The Russian bear is pictured lunging at the remote building's windows, which are protected by metal bars, trying to claw its way in.

Burly: Images of the attempted break-in, thought to have taken place at a station in Tarbinskaya, Krasnoyarsk region, appeared online

One last try: Even as the sun is going down, the bear is still trying to get through the reinforced window

No so daunting: In Michael Bond's first Paddington Bear story the bear is found in London's Paddington Station

A video capturing the bear as it prowls outside the railway station, features a male voice shouting 'Mishka, Mishka' - the local name given to brown bears.

The Krasnoyarskis region is thought to be home to a population of around 30 brown bears, with a number of reports on locals reported recently.

Specialist Vladimir Kozhechkin told the Siberian Times: 'Most of the predators don't 
come close to people. But lately, tourists and staff of the reserve keep
meeting the animals.Â 

'It happens because this year there is not enough food for the bears.
That's why they more often come to people, their houses, to places 
where tourists regularly stop in the hope of getting some food'.
