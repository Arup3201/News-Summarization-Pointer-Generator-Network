Thick grey clouds rolled across much of the UK this morning, marking the end to what was a glorious weekend.

The swallows were sunning themselves in Teesside. The bees collected nectar in Devon. And if you listened very carefully you could hear grasshoppers rubbing their legs together in South-West London.

With just six weeks to go before Christmas, Britain was basking in temperatures this weekend – and experiencing sights and sounds – more associated with May.

But, the optimism was short-lived as 
sunshine and blue skies turned to damp mist and fog, reducing visibility
across much of the country.

After a glorious weekend, the morning commute was rather a lot more gloomy this morning as a damp mist reduced visibility

St Paul's cathedral could barely be seen this morning before the thick mist eventually lifted

There wasn't much of a view from the top of the London Eye this morning as visibility was reduced to little more than a couple of hundred metres

Only Northern Ireland and the coast along North West Scotland escaped the gloomy start to the week, although temperatures there struggled to reach 10c.

Forecasters are still saying that this November is on 
course to be the most temperate since records began 353 years ago after 
temperatures reached 18c (65f) at the weekend.

The mild weather is expected to 
continue today and throughout this week, with the Met Office predicting 
highs of 15c (59f) in the South and 11c (52f) in the North.

Sussex was yesterday hotter than Syria and Cardigan, Wales, was warmer than Corfu.

This month’s average temperature so 
far has been almost as warm as May’s normal temperature of 11.2c. The saw daytrippers out in their droves enjoying the autumnal 
sunshine, with the West and South nudging 18c.

In the capital, pub beer-gardens had 
to be reopened at a time when they would usually be putting up Christmas
decorations.

And as temperatures climbed to twice England’s average 
November peaks of 9.5c (49f), summer flowers, insects and birds were 
seen still out across the country.

The mercury was within 3c of the UK’s
highest ever recorded this late in the year – 20.7c (69f) at Aber, 
North Wales, on November 17, 1997.

In contrast, Hamah, Syria, saw just 
9c yesterday, with even holiday hot-spot Corfu at only 16c (61f). 
Charlie Powell, Met Office forecaster, said: ‘We have got an air flow 
coming from the South-East which has brought up some relatively mild 
weather from countries on the continent such as France and Germany.

‘It’s unusual that the temperatures 
have been higher than average for such a prolonged time. This is going 
to continue over the next few days.’

The Met Office said the average 
central England temperature for the first half of this November has been
10.7c (51f) – almost 3c above average. Records began in 1659 and cover 
the area between London, Manchester and Bristol.

Seasonal changes: Wildlife across the UK is changing its habits because of the mild weather

Members of the Eton College Rowing Centre took to the Thames yesterday afternoon. The average temperature for the first half of this month matches temperatures normally seen in May

Jonathan Powell, of independent 
forecaster Positive Weather Solutions, said: ‘After a very mild first 
half of November including a spring-like weekend – and with an unusually
warm second half of November ahead – this month is on course to be one 
of the warmest on record, if not the warmest.’

Autumn’s remarkable run of weather has already included the sixth warmest September and eighth warmest October on record.

The warm weather is also being heralded for the unexpected blossoming of crops and wildlife.

Matthew Oates, a National Trust ecologist, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Our countryside is much more flowery than it should be.'

Meanwhile, frogs who usually reserve their croaking for months between May and June, are being heard a month before Christmas.

He added: 'These are sounds really more associated with when they breed, they are normally more vocal in May and June.'

The mild weather has seen several sightings of a higher wildlife count with Rutland Water reserve in Leicestershire, welcoming more than 30,000 birds as a result of the better temperatures.

While strawberries have been spotted fruiting near Oxford and tomatoes ripening in gardens in north London.
