The biggest penguins alive today: An Emperor Penguin stands on sea ice near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. They can reach heights of 3ft 11in tall

A penguin that stood taller than most men waddled across the southern hemisphere millions of years ago, scientists say.

Argentine experts have discovered the fossils of a 6ft 6in (2m) tall penguin that lived in prehistoric Antarctica 34million years ago.

Paleontologists with the Natural Sciences Museum of La Plata province, near the capital Buenos Aires, said the remains were found on the icy southern continent.

'This is the largest penguin known to date in terms of height and body mass,' said researcher Carolina Acosta.

The modern day record is held by emperor penguins, which reach heights of about 3ft 11in.

Lead
researcher Marcelo Reguero added that the find will 'allow for a more 
intensive and complex study of the ancestors of modern penguins.'

The
previous record for the tallest prehistoric penguins had been held by a
five foot tall bird discovered in Peru two years ago and nicknamed the Water King.

The Water King, 
which lived more than 36million years ago, was found by a Peruvian student in the Paracas Reserve on Peru's eastern coastline.

Like
the latest find, it lived at a time half way between the end of the 
dinosaurs and the modern day when the Earth was much warmer than now and
when when gigantic prehistoric birds and mammals roamed the world.

As the UK divorce rate continues to soar, a new study has today shown how marital harmony is thriving in the penguin world.

Research has revealed a pair of Magellanic penguins as among the most faithful in the animal kingdom.

The couple have remained loyal to each other over a 16-year period, in spite of spending thousands of miles apart during their winter trips.

The findings come after a 30-year study of the breed where researchers placed metal identity bands on the flippers of 50,000 birds on the southern coast of Argentina.

But unlike the Antarctic bird, and their modern day descendants, the flightless bird lived in the tropics - where it dived into warm seas using a seven-inch long spear-like beak to hunt for fish.

In its next expedition to Antarctica, during the regionâ€™s summer, the Argentine team will hunt for more fossils of the newly discovered species.

They hope to gather more information about its anatomy and how the giant penguin might have moved.

All the giant penguins that once roamed the prehistoric earth died out, leaving behind the smaller varieties which are today found only on the Antarctic.

Previous finds from prehistoric penguins indicated they did not sport the iconic black and white feathers the birds are known for today, but had reddish-brown and grey plumage.
