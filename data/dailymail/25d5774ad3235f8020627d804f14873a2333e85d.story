Warned: Nick Clegg has been told by MPs that succession reform may open a Royal Pandora's Box

Nick Clegg was accused of ‘opening a Royal Pandora’s Box’ last night over plans to change the laws of succession to the throne.

The Deputy Prime Minister told the Commons that rules giving precedence to men and the ban on heirs marrying Roman Catholics belonged to a ‘bygone era’.

The change will mean that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child, due in July, is a girl, she would ascend the throne even if she had brothers.

But MPs said the Succession to the Crown Bill was being ‘rushed’ through Parliament.

Tory MP Nicholas Soames, a close friend of Prince Charles, said the proposals came from the ‘good wheeze school of Government’ and had not been properly thought through.

Mr Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, warned of the ‘unwanted, unintended consequences that often flow from tinkering with legislation of this type and could damage the crucial relationship between church and state’.

He suggested removing the Catholic marriage ban might make it more likely that a Catholic would eventually succeed to the throne - sparking a constitutional crisis. This fear is also said to be shared by Prince Charles.

Fellow Tory Ben Wallace said an oversight in the legislation could create a financial crisis for a future female monarch as she would not inherit the £350 million Duchy of Lancaster estate if she had a younger brother. Mr Wallace said the proposals would ‘disinherit the monarch’.

The DUP’s Ian Paisley said it was ‘utter folly’ to introduce a measure to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Catholic, warning MPs the Bill opened the ‘Royal Pandora’s Box’.

‘We ought to be minimising points of potential crisis, not creating the certainty that there will be a crisis,’ he said.

‘We will create a potential set of circumstances where a future heir will have to make a choice between faith and throne, and such a choice, to discard a closely held faith for position, I believe simply creates another simply unjust choice that a person will have to make.’

Changes: The reform of the law will mean that the first-born child to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge due in July will ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl

Labour’s Paul Flynn questioned why the Bill was being rushed through. He said that by retaining the ban on a Catholic becoming monarch, the Bill ‘strengthens the prejudice of the past by not allowing all citizens the chance to become monarch’.

He accused Mr Clegg of tinkering’ with the constitution, warning that the changes contained the ‘seeds of future problems that will be obvious in the years ahead’.

Critic: Conservative MP, and friend of Prince Charles, Nicholas Soames

But Mr Clegg insisted the changes were necessary to bring the monarchy into the 21st century and end the system of primogeniture, which he said was based on the ‘supposed superiority of men’.

He said: ‘The current rules of succession belong to a bygone era. They reflect old prejudices and old fears.

‘Today we don’t support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender grounds, they have no place in modern Britain and certainly not in our monarchy, an an institution central to our constitution, to the Commonwealth and to our national identity too.’

Mr Clegg told the Commons that the 16 Commonwealth countries only agreed the Bill in writing just hours before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they were having a baby.

He said he was ‘sympathetic’ to calls to alter the rules for the inheritance of hereditary titles. But he said it was vital to keep the changes simple so that they would be accepted by the other Commonwealth nations.

Mr Clegg said the ban on Catholic marriages were part of historic anti-Catholic laws that had mostly now been swept away.

‘Catholics couldn’t vote, they were excluded from all professions and public offices, they couldn’t go to university, couldn’t teach, couldn’t be the guardian of a child, couldn’t buy land with a lease of more than 31 years, couldn’t own a horse worth more than £5,’ he said.

Mr Paisley joked he would not refer to the time when Catholics suffered widespread discrimination as ‘those Halcyon Days’.

MPs backed the law without a vote.
