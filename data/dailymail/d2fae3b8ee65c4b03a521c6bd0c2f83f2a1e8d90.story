Nathan Ker  was diagnosed with a brain tumour after enduring eight months of migraines

Nathan Ker woke up one morning with numbness on one side of his body.

When the 24-year-old construction worker went to a doctor the next day, he was sent home with some headache pills and told he was probably suffering from a bad migraine.

But the pain didn't go away. For months, he put up with agonising headaches, dizziness and numbness.

A New Zealander who had moved to Melbourne two years ago, Mr Ker was suffering and lonely, and turned to a dating site to find some companionship.

'I ended up meeting a beautiful woman named Rikki Milne,’ Mr Ker told Daily Mail Australia.

‘From the moment I met her, I somehow knew she was the one who could help my migraines disappear – by making all my problems seem like they didn't exist.’

But after three weeks of getting to know Milne, the left side of his body turned numb again.

‘I was struggling to talk,’ Ker said.

The 24-year-old met his fiance Rikki Milne just three weeks before being diagnosed with a brain tumour

The 24-year-old had endured months of headaches but eight months later, doctors found a 'large tumour'

‘Fear struck me harder than it ever had. I was trying to explain to Rikki that it was all normal and it was just a side-effect of my migraines. But I could see the fear in her eyes too.

‘This time the numbness and paralysis didn't last just minutes. I rang my mum, who is a neuro nurse and all I remember her saying was "call an ambulance".’

When Mr Ker arrived at the hospital, he undertook a CT scan but alarm bells started ringing when he was told to do a second scan but with contrast dye injected into him.

‘That’s when I knew something was wrong,’ Mr Ker said.

‘Then the doctor walked in and all I remember her saying was: "I am very sorry and there is no right way to explain this but you have a large tumour in the right side of your brain."

Mr Ker said he didn’t know what was going to happen next, which prompted him to end his relationship with his girlfriend at the time.

‘I told Rikki I couldn't be with her anymore because I was not able to put someone through what I thought I was about to go through,’ he said.

‘But she said: “it would take a security guard to drag her out of there”.

‘I have no idea what kind of pain Rikki would have been in watching it all unfold - my family members were crying on my shoulder while I was sitting in a wheelchair - having to do all this without really even knowing me.

‘She ended up having to hold me up in the shower, dress me and do everything I couldn't do with only one side of my body working. This is now why I call her my other half.’

When Mr Ker went in for his MRI scan, he claims the doctor made a ‘mistake’ after leaving his CT scan on his hospital bed.

‘I read that the prognosis was a glioma and I instantly hoped onto Google to find  survival rates were a 30 per cent for more than a year, and 15 per cent for more than two years,’ he said.

‘I told Rikki that if I made it out of that hospital alive I was going to marry her as soon as I had enough money to put a rock on her finger.

Ker received good news when he was told the tumour was non-cancerous

‘Then right before the scan, she walked in and knelt down beside my bed with a lollipop ring in her hand from the cafeteria downstairs and said: "I don't need a ring ... Nathan will you marry me?"

‘I instantly said yes.’

After his MRI results returned, he received some good news - he was diagnosed on September 2 with a meningioma - a benign (non-cancerous) tumour, which is normally found in elderly people.

‘The doctor told me I was a very lucky man,’ Ker said.

Following the results, Mr Ker went in for a surgery to have his tumour removed just a week later.

‘The neurosurgeon told me there was a 20 per cent chance I'd never move my left side again and an even higher chance I'd never get the same sort of movement in my left side,’ he said.

‘I remember having tubes and lines put throughout my arms and then waking up being wheeled to the recovery room.

‘I looked at my left side, too scared to move it, then I just open my mouth and start rapping a song I had written and tears started streaming down my face.

‘I looked down and moved the toes on my left side and then my hands. I started saying in absolute happiness, "I can move my left side!" over and over again.'

After his surgery, Ker tried to go back to work but was soon forced to leave after suffering seizures

Recalling the time before the tumour was found, Mr Ker said the pain was nearly unbearable. 

'My brother Jordan thought I was having a stroke,’ Ker told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I couldn’t move my body so he convinced me to see a doctor but when the CT scans came back – nothing showed up so I thought I was fine, until the migraines started.

‘I had already seen a neurologist and he had prescribed me heaps of different migraine medications to no effect, so I just toughed it out.

The pain endured, weeks and turning into months of excruciating migraines during which he suffered physically and mentally.

‘This pain went on for eight months straight,’ he said.

‘Some days, I’d only get a few hours’ sleep and that lasted weeks.

‘I’d wake up in the middle of the night in agony and it would feel like I had a knife inside my head – and the pain and pressure I had on my right eye was unexplainable.'

When Ker was released from hospital after his surgery, his fiance took time out of work to look after him.

‘I had found the most amazing woman in the world and couldn't understand why she loved me, but she did and over the next few weeks I slowly regained my strength,’ he said.

‘The recovery was hard and I had to learn how to walk again.’

The 24-year-old woke up one morning when he found half his body was numb where he struggled to move

After being released from hospital, Ker started working again but he soon suffered non-convulsive seizures, which forced him to quit.

‘One day at work, my head went blank and I couldn't even fold a box,’ he said.

‘I couldn't do simple tasks or see friends because I was ashamed of not being able to talk properly. I was back to having my family and fiancé pay for everything.

‘I felt like my brain had just stopped working and I couldn't talk properly but in recent times, my seizures have stopped. 

‘But I have promised Rikki I’ll fly her back to our beautiful country New Zealand for a holiday.

‘I owe my thanks to my mum Sharon and brother Jordan, my fiancee and her mother and father Pnina Rosenberg and Troy Milne for accepting me as a son, and the rest of my family and friends for being there for me since day one.’

Family and friends have set up a Give me a Little appeal in a bid to raise funds for Nathan Ker, who has not been able to go back to work since the surgery.
