Donald Burrell is said to have starting raping his victim in 1991 when she was seven-years-old, according to Pennsylvania State Police

A man has been charged with over 2,000 rapes of the same female spanning 20 years - they are among a sickening 5,100 sex counts.

Donald Burrell is said to have started raping his victim in 1991 when she was seven-years-old, according to Pennsylvania State Police.

The abuse by the now 55-year-old continued 'non-stop' for more than 20 years, state police said, and led to Burrell's recent arrest on more than 5,100 sexual abuse charges.

Burrell remained locked up in the Bradford County Jail Tuesday night on $2.2 million bond.

Preliminary court hearings are pending.

Troopers said Burrell was involved in an unrelated police matter during an investigation in May 2013.

At the time the Towanda Borough Police Department was looking for Blake Dieffenbach, who left Burrell in Robert Packer Hospital with serious injuries during an attack in May 2013, according to Action News archives.

Dieffenbach eventually turned himself in on charges of attempted criminal homicide and aggravated assault. He is serving his sentence in the State Correctional Institute-Camp Hill, according to online records.

Witnesses then told authorities last year Burrell was dealing drugs and sexually abusing a female.

State police said an investigation by the Towanda Borough Police Department that followed revealed Burrell was 'responsible for the possession and delivery of a minimum of 700 grams of bath salts' between 2011 and 2013.

It was at that time, a female victim was identified, state police said.

Burrell is facing more than 5,100 charges, including 2,258 counts of rape and thousands more added on due to the victim's age - from age 13 to incidents that allegedly happened after she turned 18.

He also faces eight counts of possession of child pornography and 25 counts of delivery of a controlled substance (bath salts), according to the news release.Â
