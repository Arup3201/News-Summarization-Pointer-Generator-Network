Caroline Loweth, 48, has been jailed for life after being found guilty of knifing her partner to death on October 27 last year

A woman who told police her partner died when he accidentally fell on a knife while peeling vegetables has been jailed for life after being found guilty of his murder.

Caroline Loweth, 48, knifed John Fletcher to death at their flat in Wolverhampton city centre on October 27 last year.

The 53-year-old relief pub manager died of a single stab wound to the heart.

Loweth denied murder and Wolverhampton Crown Court heard she dialled 999 and told an ambulance operator Mr Fletcher had slipped and impaled himself while preparing their lunch.

But a jury took 10 hours and 45 minutes to return a unanimous guilty verdict yesterday.

During the trial the court heard Loweth had a history of violence and had previously stabbed Mr Fletcher on four separate occasions before his death.

Mr Fletcher had reported one incident but withdrew the complaint when he decided to give the relationship another chance.

Speaking after the verdict, Detective Sergeant Harry May, from West Midlands Police, said: ‘During this investigation it became quite clear that John Fletcher had suffered many extremely serious injuries at the hands of his partner.

‘Fuelled by alcohol, Loweth would regularly lose her temper and stab John.

‘In one of these attacks John was stabbed through his bowel and had to undergo intensive surgery to save his life.

‘The sad fact is that if he had followed through with these previous complaints he may still be alive.

‘Today our thoughts go out to John’s family who are all devastated by his tragic murder.

‘John was a good man who was loved by all who knew him and this has made his killing all the more difficult for them to deal with.’

During the two-week trial the jury heard the 999 call Loweth made after she stabbed Mr Fletcher.

She told the operator: ‘He was peeling some vegetables and has fallen on a knife. All this happened when I was out of the room.’

But a Home Office pathologist said Mr Fletcher’s injuries were consistent with being deliberately stabbed with a six-inch knife.

Dr Olaf Biedrzycki said a blow with ‘approaching severe’ force was needed to inflict the fatal wound.

He said the blade damaged a rib as it plunged up to five inches into his chest.

Loweth was jailed for life and told she would serve at least 17 years before being eligible for parole.

Detective Inspector Kim Madill, from the West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said: ‘We take all reports of domestic abuse very seriously.

‘We often find that men are reluctant to report abuse and where weapons are being used the abuse can escalate and become life threatening, long before they seek help.’
