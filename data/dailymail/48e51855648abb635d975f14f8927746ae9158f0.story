The Dickson County Sheriff's Office in Middle Tennessee ended up paying a ransom after a malicious computer program blocked access to their files.

Detective Jeff McCliss told WTVF-TV that malware on a computer locked the agency's case files, which included autopsy reports, witness statements and crime scene photos.

He says the malware, called 'Cryptowall,' doesn't tamper with files on a computer, but keeps them locked until a ransom is paid.

No choice: Jeff McCliss grimaced when he was forced to pay $500 worth in bitcoins in order to retrieve case files locked by a computer virus called Cryptoware

'Every sort of document that you could develop in an investigation was in that folder. There was a total of 72,000 files,' McCliss said Tuesday.

After consulting with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the FBI, McCliss said the agency determined the only way to get their files back was to pay the asking price: $500 in bitcoins.

Officials think the malware came from an ad someone in the department clicked on.

'Is it better to take a stand and lose all that information? Or make the payment grit your teeth and just do it?' he said.

 'It made me sick to have to do that,' he said. 

McCliss says it doesn't appear that the office was targeted and that it could happen to any computer.

WDKN General Manager Kenneth Forte said the police station’s web use is hosted by third party company, Securenet Systems.

They believe the problem has been fixed.

'It's a bad feeling. It's a very bad feeling to be the victim instead of the investigator,' he said.

Cyber crimes like these are hard to investigate because oftentimes criminals are anonymous online users and commit their crimes overseas.
