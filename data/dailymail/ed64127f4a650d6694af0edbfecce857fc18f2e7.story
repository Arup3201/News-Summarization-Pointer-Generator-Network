Ryanair is getting a makeover - and it's all starting with a new on-time jingle.

The music is being rolled out on all aircraft as part of Ryanair's 'Always Getting Better' campaign, following a Twitter poll last year that saw customers vote to remove the original trumpet-heavy tune.

It was released on Ryanair's YouTube page, along with footage of what the brand's new Boeing 737 MAX 200 will look like.

The jingle was posted to YouTube, along with footage of the airline's new Boeing 737 MAX planes

'Thank you for flying Ryanair,' the recording begins.

'Last year, over 90 per cent of our flights arrived on time.

We hope you enjoyed yours and we look forward to welcoming you on board again soon.'  

'The new jingle is currently being rolled out on all Ryanair aircraft and is part of our ongoing improvements to the inflight experience,' Robin Kiely, the airline's spokesman, told MailOnline Travel.

'Our customers voted to remove the original trumpet fan fare through an Twitter poll last year and this is our newest version.'

Ryanair's video also features CGI footage of the new interiors, which are notably toned down

'It’s become synonymous with the Ryanair flight experience to hear an on-time arrival jingle, after all, over 90 per cent of our flights land on-time, and the new version has proven popular with our customers so far,' he added.

The airline is also going to be given a bit of a makeover with their new aircraft, which will arrive in 2019 and feature less of the brand's signature bright yellow colour.

The planes will have an additional eight seats.
