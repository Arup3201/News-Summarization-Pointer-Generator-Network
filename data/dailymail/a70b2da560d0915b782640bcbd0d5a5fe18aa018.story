Rafael Nadal had to be protected by security guards at the French Open yesterday after a protester against gay marriages ran on to the court during the men’s final.

The man, who was stripped to the waist, wearing a mask and carrying a flare, was bundled to the ground by guards.

The incident followed a protest against same-sex marriage by accomplices in the stands.

Making a point: A protester runs on to the court with a lit flare during the French Open final

Led away: Rafael Nadal looks on as the protester is escorted off court

After the intruder was led away, 
Nadal shook hands with his bodyguard before resuming play and beating 
fellow Spaniard David Ferrer to win his eighth French Open title.

On his back, the half-naked 
demonstrator displayed the name of the protest group Hommen, which has 
become increasingly vocal against same-sex marriages.

The issue has caused uproar in France
after president Francois Hollande legalised gay marriages last month – 
the 13th country in the world to do so.

Hommen are demanding a referendum on 
the new law, claiming that it undermines the sanctity of  the family, 
and thousands have attended protest marches all over the country.

The first gay wedding took place last month in the city of Montpellier, southern France. 

Nadal admitted he had initially been 
frightened, saying: 'It was a very quick moment. I felt a little bit 
scared at the first moment because I didn't see what was going on.

'I just turned and I saw a guy with 
some fire, so I got a little bit scared at the first second. But then I 
saw that it's one of those things that nobody can prevent.

'I just can say thank you very much 
to all the security guys. They did amazing work. They were very quick 
and they were very courageous.'

Extinguish: Officials attempt to put out the flare following the on court protest

A few minutes earlier, play had been briefly interrupted when two protesters high in the stands began chanting.

They were waving a banner saying in 
English, 'Help France tramples on children's rights', and it was 
believed the protests were coordinated by people opposed to gay 
marriage.

There were also protests on Roland 
Garros' second court, Suzanne Lenglen, where a group of men also with 
slogans on their bodies and wearing masks held up flares and unveiled a 
banner calling on president Francois Hollande to resign.

The same-sex marriage bill, which 
also legalises gay adoption, was signed into law by Hollande last month 
and a huge protest march took place in Paris on the first day of the 
tournament two weeks ago.

Escorted out: The protesters were led away shortly afterwards

A spokeswoman for the France Tennis Federation said: 'The incident is over and is now in the hands of the police.'

Nadal's PR representative Benito 
Perez Barbadillo tweeted: 'When are they going to stop mixing politics 
and sport? Left, right, center, they are all the same. Leave us alone!'

It is the second time in five years an intruder has managed to get onto Court Philippe Chatrier during the men's final.

In 2009, a man dressed in a Spanish 
bullfighter's outfit was allowed to confront Roger Federer before being 
tackled by security staff.
