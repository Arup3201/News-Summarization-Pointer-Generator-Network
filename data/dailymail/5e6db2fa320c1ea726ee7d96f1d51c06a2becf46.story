Raheem Sterling is a menace for the world's defences whether bombing down the wing or unleashing his arsenal of trickery in tight spaces - the same can't be said for his ping pong ability.

Mario Balotelli is the latest Liverpool star to claim the scalp of starlet Sterling on the table tennis table, with the standard humiliation being for the loser being the indignity of climbing under the table to be photographed. 

Sterling's last public ping pong humbling came from Luis Enrique, Liverpool's serial destroyer with a paddle and a plastic ball and a strict enforcer of the under the table forfeit.

As is customary, Italian striker Balotelli turned to Instagram to share his victory over the 19-year-old with the world.

'Loool ops! Mario still the Champion in ping pong,' Balotelli posted, tagging Raheem's official profile @31sterling for full effect.

Balotelli is having a good week at the Reds, appearing to get along well with his team-mates after scoring his first goal for the club in their Champions League win over Ludogorets.
