Death row inmate Richard Glossip, whose execution has been blocked after challenging Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure 

The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the execution of three inmates on death row in Oklahoma after they challenged the state's lethal injection procedure.

The decision means that convicted killers Richard Glossip, John Grant and Benjamin Cole will not be put to death using a sedative, which they have claimed is cruel.

However, the court's order does leave open the possibility that the state could proceed with the executions of the prisoners using different drug combinations.

Last week, the high court agreed to hear the case, but did not block the inmates' death sentences at that time. Arguments before the high court are set for April, with a decision due by the end of June.

Oklahoma's three-drug process has been under scrutiny since the botched execution of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett in April last year.

He could be seen twisting on the gurney after death chamber staff failed to place the IV properly.

The inmates challenging the state's procedures argue the sedative midazolam, used by Oklahoma, cannot achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, making it unsuitable for executions.

Dale Baich, an attorney representing the inmates said: 'The scientific evidence tells us that even the proper administration of midazolam can result in an inhumane execution.

But the state of Oklahoma contends its current drug combination is appropriate and effective.

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin explained: 'I disagree with the necessity to grant Glossip yet another round of legal appeals. 

'However, given that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear his case, it is entirely appropriate to delay his execution until after the legal process has run its course.

The executions of Benjamin Cole, left, and John Grant, right, have also been blocked after a Supreme Court order  

Glossip, who was convicted of arranging for his employer to be beaten to death, was scheduled to be executed on Thursday.

After hearing the news that his execution has been blocked, Glossip told the Huffington Post: 'I've felt amazing today.

'Unless it's your life on the line, you don't know how heavy it is.'

He has staunchly maintained his innocence from the start, and his case has attracted the support of high-profile death penalty opponents.

Grant, who stabbed a correctional worker to death, was due to be executed on February 19, while Cole, convicted of killing his nine-month-old daughter, was scheduled for execution on March 5.

In a similar case earlier this month, the high court declined to halt Oklahoma's execution of Charles Warner, convicted of raping and murdering an 11-month-old baby.

Warner had raised the same legal question as the other inmates.
