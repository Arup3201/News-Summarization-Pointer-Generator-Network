A mother was left 'shocked and disgusted' when she opened a packet of dried baby powder for her four-month-old - and found a dead 'scorpion' inside.

Caroline Black, 29, who had already used half the contents of the tub to feed her baby Olivia before making the discovery.

She now fears her daughter’s health could be endangered if the milk has been contaminated.

A spokesman for SMA said: 'We are committed to the safety and quality of our products'

Caroline, a mother of two from St Helens, Lancashire, said: 'I was absolutely shocked and disgusted - I couldn’t believe it.

'You see it happening to other people but you never think it will happen to you.'

SMA Foods say that the grisly stowaway is more likely to be a common house spider.

Caroline,
 who also has a six year-old daughter, Grace, was preparing an evening 
bottle for her baby daughter when she made her grim find.

Horrified,
 she sent husband Lee out to buy a replacement before immediately 
reporting the incident to the product’s makers, SMA Foods.

She claims they initially insisted the arachnid was likely to be little more than burnt powder and urged her to send it back to them in a jiffy bag.

Instead Caroline and IT manager Lee, also 29, asked environmental officers from St Helens Council to inspect the find.

'They had a good look and said they were almost 100 per cent certain it was a scorpion,' claimed Caroline.

But SMA Foods say that officers believe it is actually a spider.

A spokesman said: 'Following an initial investigation by the EHO we have been advised that this is not a scorpion and that it is most likely to be a very small house spider.

'As is our standard practice, we alerted our manufacturing facility in Ireland immediately after receiving the complaint, and they have conducted a full assessment at the plant based on the information received.

'We also asked Mrs Black to return the tin and the contents to us so that we can conduct a thorough examination.  

'We would like to reassure all our customers that this is an isolated complaint, and our products are safe to use.

'If anyone has any concerns, we would urge them to contact our Careline free on 0800 0 81 81 80.

'We are committed to the safety and quality of our products, and we take reports like this very seriously.'
