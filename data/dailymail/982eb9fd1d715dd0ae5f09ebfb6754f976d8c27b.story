The parents of a four-year-old boy who they say suffered permanent disabilities after a botched water birth are calling for all water births at an Oregon health center to be banned.

In a lawsuit filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Amy Benton and Matthew Marino are suing for $35 million for their son's care and asking a judge to prohibit Legacy Health System from using the method.

Legacy has five hospitals in the state and the couple want water births banned at all locations. 

They say their son Luca was left with cerebral palsy, hearing problems and other disabilities that will need life-long care after the mistakes made on December 14, 2011, according to the Oregonian.

Lawsuit: Matthew Marino and Amy Benton, pictured when Luca was a baby, say he suffered life-altering disabilities after they were not warned about the dangers of water births by their hospital in Portland

The water birth never should have even been approved because of complications Benton suffered during the pregnancy, according to the suit, and instead he should have been delivered by c-section.

They said they were never warned about the dangers of water births, despite The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics saying its safety has not yet been established.

Staff failed to monitor his fetal heart rate continuously and he was not born on time, leaving him deprived of oxygen, the suit says. The staff then failed to resuscitate him immediately, they claim.

The suit adds that the hospital allowed midwives and nurses to manage the delivery without an obstetrician and had not been adequately trained.

The lawsuit seeks $23 million for Luca's current and future medical expenses, and $10 million for his pain and suffering from cerebral palsy and a brain injury. 

It asks for another $3 million for the child's 'loss of future hearing capacity'.

'This boy will need a great deal of care the rest of his life,' the couple's attorney Rich Rogers told the Portland Business Journal.

Though not the norm, water births have gained popularity over recent decades.

On its website, Legacy says that studies carried out in Europe have shown less pain medication is needed and that less pain is felt during a water birth. It also cites 'high patient satisfaction'.  

Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a joint opinion that immersion in water during the first stage of labor may decrease pain and the duration of labor.

But it also said the safety and efficacy of delivering a baby underwater have not been established.

'Given these facts and case reports of rare but serious adverse effects in the newborn, the practice of immersion in the second stage of labor should be considered an experimental procedure that should only be performed within the context of an appropriately designed clinical trial with informed consent,' it said. 

They cited on study that found 12 per cent of the babies delivered by water birth were admitted to special care units, whereas none of the babies born outside water were admitted. 

'His parents have had their lives greatly altered. The sad thing is, none of it had to happen. Legacy failed to inform Amy and Matthew of the dangers of water birth and failed to provide a safe environment for the baby's birth.'

Legacy said it would not comment on pending litigation. The suit was first filed in August 2014 but was filed again after adding more detail.  

Though not the norm, water births have gained popularity over recent decades.

The Legacy Health System website says water birth is available at Legacy Family Birth Centers and at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, the hospital where Luca was born.

'European studies have shown a lower use of pain medication, decreased need for medicines to stimulate labor, decreased perception of pain, and high patient satisfaction, among other benefits, during labor and delivery in a birth tub,' the website states. 

But the website also says that water births are for low-risk, single pregnancies. In their suit, the couple say that they were not considered low risk due to complications throughout Benton's pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a joint opinion last year that immersion in water during the first stage of labor may decrease pain and the duration of labor.

But it said the safety and efficacy of delivering a baby underwater have not been established. 

Given these facts and case reports of rare but serious adverse effects in the newborn, the practice of immersion in the second stage of labor should be considered an experimental procedure that should only be performed within the context of an appropriately designed clinical trial with informed consent,' it said.
