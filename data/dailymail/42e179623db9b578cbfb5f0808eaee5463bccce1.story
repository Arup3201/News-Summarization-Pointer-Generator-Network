A woman once described as the Jackie Kennedy of China was yesterday charged with the murder of an Old Harrovian businessman.

Chinese authorities accused Gu Kailai of poisoning Neil Heywood with cyanide after he threatened her son in a row over money. If convicted, she could face the death penalty.

The charge marks a dramatic fall from grace for Mrs Gu, the daughter of a Mao-era revolutionary hero.

Her husband Bo Xilai was one of China’s most powerful politicians until the scandal erupted earlier this year.

She is expected to face a ‘show trial’
within weeks and the timing of yesterday’s announcement that she had 
been charged prompted speculation that prosecutors could hold the case 
during the Olympics in an attempt to reduce international interest.

The state-run news agency Xinhua said Mrs Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were both charged with poisoning Mr Heywood.

The Xinhua report added: ‘The facts of
the two defendants’ crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable 
and substantial. Therefore, the defendants should be charged with 
intentional homicide.’

The arrest of Mrs Gu, 53, and the 
suspension of her husband from China’s ruling Politburo was humiliating 
for the country’s political elite, ahead of this year’s once-a-decade 
leadership contest.

Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in a 
hotel room in China last November. At first officials blamed the expat’s
death on excess alcohol, and his body was cremated without a post- 
mortem examination.

But in February Mr Bo’s former police 
chief, Wang Lijun, told officials he believed the consultant was the 
victim of poisoning, allegedly on the orders of Mrs Gu.

Mr Heywood mentored the Chinese power 
couple’s son, Bo Guagua, to secure a place at Harrow, the leading public
school in North-West London.

Mr Heywood went on to work as a ‘fixer’ for Mr Bo, the Communist Party leader in the eastern city of Chongqing.

Reports have claimed Mr Heywood helped
Mrs Gu to smuggle money out of China, and that she allegedly funnelled 
up to £3.8billion to accounts in the names of relatives and friends 
overseas.

Commentators in China have questioned 
whether she used some of the money to pay her playboy son’s fees at 
Harrow, and subsequently at Oxford and Harvard universities.

Mrs Gu, a former lawyer, faces a legal
system in which police, prosecutors and judges are all controlled by 
the Communist Party. The country has a conviction rate of around 98 per 
cent.

Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with 
his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a 
meeting last November and was found dead a day later.

State media said Mrs Gu and her son 
had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu 
was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’.

If convicted, Mrs Gu and her alleged 
accomplice may face death by lethal injection although the death penalty
is sometimes commuted to a life sentence in high-profile cases.

Mr Bo, 63, was removed as party 
secretary in Chongqing in March and has been under house arrest since 
then while he waits to learn the decision of a party investigation into 
allegations of ‘serious discipline violations’.
