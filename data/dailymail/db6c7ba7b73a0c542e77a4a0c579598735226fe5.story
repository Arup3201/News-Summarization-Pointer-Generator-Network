A strange masked couple, thought to be armed, have handed themselves into police after terrifying local residents.

A man and a woman wearing white hockey masks stalked parkland areas in the city of Auckland, New Zealand, for up to three weeks according to reports.

Police responded with armed officers after they received a number of calls about the pair carrying what looked like firearms.

One witness was conveniently a film student at Auckland SAE Institute. He wrote in a blog post, shared on Live Leak, that he spotted them while filming a skit and initially thought they were ‘playing a prank’.

He then allegedly noticed ‘the male cocked his pistol as he started to approach’. 

A strange masked couple were spotted in a parkland area in the city of Auckland

‘We were filming at Parnell Railway Station, and after we were done, discussing the footage, I looked past my friends into the bush on the opposite side of the railway to us, to see two masked figures stand up from behind the taller grass and shrubs,’ the student wrote.

‘We were all a bit confused, nervous, and we laughed, but found ourselves backing away, intimidated. Once they emerged and started to follow us we picked up the pace, splitting up and making our way back towards the main road,’ he said.

Fellow film student Jayden O'Neill told Stuff.co.nz the encounter 'was funny at first'.

'But they (the masked pair) wouldn't say anything and just stared. We were half entertained and half scared because we had no idea what they were doing,' she said.

The film school's manager Leyland Bottomley told the website: 'It's not a hoax.'

Police believed them to be armed and put out a warning telling the pair to come forwards 

After weeks of being spotted the pair handed themselves into police after terrifying local residents

But a spokesperson for Auckland SAE Institute told Daily Mail Australia: 'We won't be making any comment on this.' 

The student filmed his encounter with the scary masked couple and posted the footage online.

Explaining the video, he wrote: ‘The last shot is while we were divided, me and the voice you can hear were looking for the guy from the first video clip, who had taken before us, and we realised they were following him directly.’

He later returned to the scene with friends to find a police helicopter circling the area.

‘We called the police, met up with them, and gave our report. They didn't say much but they went and looked armed with an M4 and kevlar vests.

Auckland Police wrote in a Facebook updated that they had deployed armed officers

The film school has denied their students have anything to do with the two masked people

‘If you look closely in the video you can see that the female is armed. Whether the weapon is real or not, I just don't know. But someone else had already called the cops before we had a chance,’ he added.

Auckland Police added three photos of the masked pair on their Facebook page, writing: ‘We strongly encourage the people in these pics to make contact with us so we can have a chat about their recent activities around Parnell and in the Domain.’

Police warned ‘it appears these two people are carrying firearms of some sort which, aside from being incredibly scary for people who encounter them, is incredibly dangerous for the masked individuals themselves.’

‘When police are notified of people carrying and displaying weapons in public, we respond with armed officers,’ they wrote.

Adding: ‘We have no way of knowing until we seize a “weapon” whether it’s real or imitation so we always treat it as real.

‘Wise up. Drop the masked act and come and chat with us about how to play safely.’

In an update on Thursday, they revealed the masked park pair are ‘currently speaking with our officers at Auckland Central after having made contact with Police mid afternoon.

‘Thanks to you all for sharing our story and helping to make sure they learn the errors of their ways’.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Auckland Police for comment.
