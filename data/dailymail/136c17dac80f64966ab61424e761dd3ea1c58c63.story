The mother of the suspected LA arsonist is facing deportation over claims she failed to pay for a breast enlargement operation in her native Germany.

Harry Burkhart, 24, was arrested on suspicion of starting more than 50 fires in the Hollywood area and has now been charged with dozens of counts of arson.

He is suspected to have started his arson spree after seeing his mother dragged off by State Department officials.

Yesterday his mother Dorothee Burkhart, who is in her 50s, appeared in court charged with 19 counts of fraud in Frankfurt, some of them allegedly carried out 'as a member of gang'.

She claimed her son was 'mentally ill', and produced a letter from a Canadian doctor which appeared to support this, suggesting that he is autistic and suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr Burkhart is currently on suicide watch in police custody. It emerged today that he is suspected of being responsible for a fire at a house in Germany owned by his family.

Ms Burkhart appears to own an erotic 
massage business, and has been linked to websites offering the services 
of 'Goddess Annabelle' in the Hollywood area.

The sites describe their owner as a 'sexologist', but emphasise that her massages are not to be confused with prostitution.

The potential deportation of Ms 
Burkhart, who is said not to have a valid visa, is thought to be 
connected to her pony-tailed son's alleged rampage through Los Angeles.

In a brief court appearance, where 
she was accused of crimes including avoiding payment for her breast 
augmentation surgery, she appeared perplexed, wondering aloud if her son
was dead.

'Where is my son? What did you do to my son?' she asked the judge.

Harry Burkhart was being held without bail after being arrested in the arson case on Monday.

According to a police officer, Mr Burkhart erupted into an anti-American rant at a recent immigration hearing for his mother.

Attacks: The arsonist set 12 new fires early on Monday morning, in North Hollywood, California

Outside his Hollywood apartment, some
neighbours described him as a loner who loitered around the busy 
commercial strip at night and could be heard arguing with his mother.

But Shlomo Elady, a hair stylist who 
regularly trimmed Burkhart's long hair, recalled someone who spoke three
languages, dreamed of visiting Jerusalem and cared for a sickly mother 
who had trouble walking.

Mr Elady said he was stunned that the
man who lived with his mother above his Sunset Boulevard shop is 
suspected of torching vehicles, some just steps from his home. The fires
caused an estimated $3million in damage.

'He loved his mom, the way every son loves his mom,' Mr Elady said. 'He's not a creepy guy.'

Mr Burkhart was described by Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca as ‘the most dangerous arsonist’ he 
could remember in the area, after more than 50 fires caused $3million in
damage.

The arson 
attacks destroyed parked cars and scorched buildings across Hollywood, 
West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. Since the arrest firemen 
have not attended any more suspicious fires.

‘Our long four-day nightmare is 
over,’ Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said, after the 
suspect was arrested for investigation of arson of an inhabited dwelling
and held on $250,000 bail.

Burkhart, of Frankfurt, Germany, was 
pulled over by a reserve sheriff's deputy who works for $1 a year - 
although the investigation is ongoing and authorities haven't ruled out 
others being involved.

Police
searched a Sunset Boulevard apartment located above a hair salon and 
optician's on Monday night where Burkhart is believed to have lived for 
more than a year, reported the Los Angeles Times.

The
arrest was a measure of relief to anxious residents who had grown 
fearful after several nights of seemingly random blazes. Police have not
released any motive. He is due in court on Wednesday.

Galina Illarionova, who lives in the 
same apartment complex as the suspect, told reporters that an agitated 
Burkhart visited her on Sunday and said his mother was in trouble with 
authorities.

Advice: Firefighters and police are urging residents to check their cars and ensure they keep parking lots secure

Attacks: The fires have been started in several areas of Los Angeles over the last five days

Surveillance: Police say the person of interest (right) is a white male between 20 and 30 years old with a receding hairline and a shoulder-length ponytail

‘We are very confident in this 
arrest, but we have a long way to go,’ said Police Chief Charlie Beck 
Authorities do not know how long he has been in the U.S. and said he 
isn't cooperating with them.

One
of Sheriff Baca's reserve deputies, Shervin Lalezary, pulled over 
Burkhart's van sought by arson investigators shortly after 3am. Mr 
Lalezary works as a lawyer and said he was glad he helped out.

‘I'm
ecstatic that law enforcement gets to shine a little bit,’ Mr Lalezary 
said. Burkhart reportedly told authorities 'I hate America' as he was 
arrested, according to ABC News.

Rick Savage, who was there when a man
believed to be Burkhart was arrested, said witnesses gave him the 
middle finger when he was sitting in the back of the squad car, and he 
smiled in response.

The
onslaught of fires left residents on edge over the weekend in some of 
the city’s most densely populated areas. Hundreds of investigators, 
police officers and firemen dealt with the blazes.

Police conducted extra patrols all weekend, and the noise of helicopters and sirens persisted virtually nonstop in Hollywood.

The
blazes forced many apartment dwellers from their homes. But there were 
no serious injuries - one fireman was hurt in a fall from a ladder, and 
another person suffered smoke inhalation.

Locations: A map displayed at a press conference on Monday shows the locations of dozens of arson fires that were set over the weekend in Los Angeles, California

Response: The fires started shortly after midnight and occurred over a four-hour span before dawn

One of Saturday's fires was at the 
Hollywood and Highland entertainment complex, a popular tourist spot 
bordered by the Walk of Fame in a neighbourhood including Grauman's 
Chinese Theatre.

Shervin Lalezary,  a reserve sheriff's deputy who works for $1 a year, was billed as a 'true hero' by Sheriff Baca.

The Beverly Hills real estate lawyer spotted Burkhart's Dodge Caravan in the early hours of Monday morning.

He qualified to ride a patrol car solo last month and had back-up from LAPD officers when he went up to the van.

One of
the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim 
Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27. It was listed for 
nearly $1.2million earlier this year.

He
used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s 
and it was the inspiration for the Doors' song ‘Love Street’.

Despite 
the arrest, authorities continued to urge vigilance.

‘We're
not resting, and we're not stopping’ the extra patrols, Police 
Commander Andrew Smith said on Monday. ’If you have lights in your carport area, 
keep them on tonight.’

Other deliberate fires were reported in Hollywood on Thursday and 
two people were arrested. But police said that those suspects were not 
connected with the 52 other blazes.
