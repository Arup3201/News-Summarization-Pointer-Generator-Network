Labour's Siobhain McDonagh said some satellite stations are able to broadcast attacks on religious minorities in rare dialects

British youngsters are being radicalised by hate-filled sermons broadcast on satellite TV in obscure foreign dialects, MPs have warned.

Labour's Siobhain McDonagh said some satellite stations are able to broadcast attacks on religious minorities in rare dialects because regulators cannot understand what they are saying.

It comes amid warnings that the threat from home-grown terrorists is at its highest level since 9/11 - with Home Secretary Theresa May revealing today that at least three serious terror plots have been foiled recently.

Ms McDonagh called on the Government crack-down on channels that may be radicalising people in Britain.

During culture questions in the Commons, the Labour MP asked him: ‘On December 22 Geo TV broadcast a programme entitled Hatred Against The Ahmadi Muslim Community and five days later an Ahmadi Muslim was murdered in Gujranwala, Pakistan.’

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey revealed the media watchdog Ofcom was now investigating complaints about hate sermons being broadcast over satellite TV.

The revelation comes amid growing fears over the terror threat posed by fanatics returning from the front line in Syria.

Chancellor George Osborne this morning confirmed that the emergency services were practising for ‘marauding’ Paris-style gun attacks which spread out from a city centre and last for days.

He said: 'We have put more money into counter-terrorism, into organisations like MI5, even during these difficult times when we’ve have to make cuts elsewhere, it is all about getting your priorities right.

'And at the same time, we are looking now at armed response, we’ve done quite a lot of practises in this country for situations where people have guns and there marauding around town centres.'

In a Commons statement yesterday afternoon, Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs that innocent lives were being put 'at risk' by a failure to give the security services the powers they need to prevent a terrorist attack.

She said the UK's anti-terror agencies were increasingly powerless to tracking British-based fanatics because the law stops them from monitoring emails.

The Tory Cabinet Minister said every day that passed without giving MI5 and the police new powers meant 'crimes will go unpunished and innocent lives will be put at risk'.

She also claimed that around 600 Britons are now thought to have travelled to Syria to fight on the front line with ISIS. Across Europe there are now thought to be up to 5,000 Islamist fanatics at large after returning from the Middle East.

It comes after David Cameron held talks with spy chiefs earlier this week to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence'.

The Prime Minister asked the police and military to 'continue to work closely together' to ensure that the police, who lead on counter-terror measures, can call on military back-up when needed across the country.

Discussion centred on levels of preparedness for 'marauding' gun attacks, similar to those seen in Mumbai in 2008 when 164 people died in 12 shooting and bomb attacks over four days.

Police and security agencies 'regularly' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris, Downing Street said.

'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios.'

It is understood that particular focus has been on the way brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi moved from central Paris after carrying out their attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

They are said to have spent a night in woodland before trying to return to the capital, before becoming holed up on an industrial estate in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele.

A spokesman for the media regulator Ofcom this morning insisted it had experienced translators for non-English channels to ensure hate speech was not broadcast in the UK.

He said: 'Ofcom has strict rules forbidding the broadcast of harmful extremist material and hate speech over the airwaves.

'This is a matter we take extremely seriously and when broadcasters break our rules we take robust enforcement action, which can range from fines to revoking licences.

'We also have targeted monitoring of programming to ensure compliance with the Broadcasting Code and use experienced translators for content not broadcast in English.

'We have already fined one UK TV station £25,000 for abusing the religious beliefs of Ahmadis, and two others a total of £170,000 for broadcasting hate speech.'
