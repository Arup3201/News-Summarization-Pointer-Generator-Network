Hillary Clinton has stuck by her defense of the prisoner exchange that led to the release of Bowe Bergdahl saying that the priority was to get the American soldier back no matter what led to his capture.

‘We want to get an American home, whether they fell off the ship because they were drunk or they were pushed or they jumped, we try to rescue everybody,’ she said in an interview with NBC as part of her book tour.

'That's part of who we are, and that sets us apart from a lot of other countries in the world who cheapen life, who don't care.'

Explaining the process: Hillary Clinton reportedly initially refused a similar plan to exchange prisoners for Bergdahl but now she is reiterating the White House' defense of the swap

The flippant remark comes as a debate rages on about the lengths to which the administration went to rescue Bergdahl who is believed to have willingly left the base and deserted his Army mission in Afghanistan before being captured by the Taliban in 2009.

She also elaborated about the five Taliban leaders who were released from Guantanamo Bay, saying that in spite of the outcry from both the public and political leaders, she does not think that American safety has been put in jeopardy as a result of their release.

‘These five guys are not a threat to the United States,’ she told NBC’s Cynthia McFadden.

‘They are a threat to the safety and security of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's up to those two countries to make the decision once and for all that these are threats to them. So I think we may be kind of missing the bigger picture here.’

Principle: Clinton says that the Bergdahl swap was necessary to keep up the American adage of getting all military personnel home

This comes after it was revealed that while she was Secretary of State, Clinton opposed the idea of a prisoner swap for Bergdahl because she did not trust the terrorist groups that they would undoubtedly return to once released.

Her aides have contradicted those reports, and she has remained publicly supportive of the move.

Her spokesman Nick Merrill said specifically that she ‘set a high bar and insisted on strict conditions for any deal’, offering that as an insight into why no such swap took place under her tenure.

‘You don't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There's a lot that you don't want to have happen. On the other hand you also don't want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to die in captivity,’ she said last week.

‘This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen - is an American citizen - was serving in our military... The idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform, I think is a very noble one.’

Making the rounds: Clinton's interview is one in a series of public appearances to promote her book, and on Wednesday she was in Chicago sharing the stage with Rahm Emanual, the city's mayor who used to work for her husband

Her interview comes as part of the publicity roll out for her book Hard Choices, which went on sale Tuesday.

The NBC interview aired Tuesday night and just hours later, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was seated in front of the House Armed Services Committee to testify about his knowledge of the planning process of the prisoner exchange- specifically answering why the administration did not notify Congressional leaders 30 days before Bergdahl was released.

‘Time was not on our side,’ Hagel said during his testimony Wednesday morning.

'Since the time he went missing we've been looking for ways to get him back.

'This was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him.'
