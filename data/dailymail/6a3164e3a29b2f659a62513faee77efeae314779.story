Anger: The death of 32-year-old Youssef al-Ramouni, which Israeli police claim was a suicide, sparked several protests and stone-throwing incidents in the Palestinian suburbs of Jerusalem (stock image)

Youssef al-Ramouni, a 32-year-old father-of-two, was found dead
at the start of the route he was supposed to have driven late on
Sunday, in an area of Jerusalem close to Jewish settlements and
Palestinian neighbourhoods.

Israeli police said the evidence suggested al-Ramouni had
committed suicide, but rumours quickly spread in the Palestinian
media that he had been killed by Jewish assailants.

'The bus driver committed suicide, there is no other
indication other than it was a suicide case,' police spokesman
Micky Rosenfeld said.

However, al-Ramouni's brother, Louy, said there was
no way his brother, the father of two young children, would have
killed himself and said there were marks on his body that
suggested he had been killed.

'I saw the body last night and I saw bruises and marks that
he was beaten up,' he said.

Tense situation: An Israeli soldier watches as protesters avoid a tear gas fired by the Israeli army during a protest over tension in Jerusalem, near the West Bank village of Hizma, south-east of Ramallah, last week

'There were marks of fingers on the body and also on his
back there was a bruise as if he was hit by a hard object. ...
Youssef cannot commit suicide, it is not possible, he is leading
a good and happy life with his wife and his family,' he added.

Israeli police said an autopsy would take place at Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv to determine cause of death.

Al-Ramouni's family has requested
that a Palestinian pathologist be present, but it was not clear
if that would be allowed.

The incident quickly touched off Palestinian stone-throwing
protests and a general strike in some large Palestinian suburbs
of Jerusalem.

In Abu Dis, a Palestinian town on the outskirts of
Jerusalem, shops closed after news of Ramouni's death and masked
youngsters blocked roads with dumpsters. Dozens of youths threw
stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired tear gas.

The death comes at a time of heightened tension across
Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, where there have
been almost daily clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian
protesters in the predominantly Arab, eastern side of the city.

Over the past month, five Israelis and a foreign visitor
have been killed by Palestinians, either run over in
vehicle-based attacks or stabbed. About a dozen Palestinians
have been killed, including those accused of carrying out the
attacks.

Residents trace the violence in Jerusalem back to July, when
a Palestinian teenager was burned to death by Jewish assailants,
a revenge attack for the abduction and killing of three Jewish
teenagers by Palestinian militants in the West Bank.

Tensions have further been fuelled by the seven-week war in
Gaza and by a dispute over Jerusalem's holiest site.
