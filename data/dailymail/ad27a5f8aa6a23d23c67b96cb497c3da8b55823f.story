A man suspected of murdering a woman in a Cardiff hotel room has been arrested by police in Tanzania.

Sammy Almahri, 44, from New York, has been wanted since the discovery of 28-year-old Nadine Aburas's body at the Future Inn, Cardiff Bay, on New Year's Eve.

South Wales Police confirmed Almahri had been detained following an international manhunt.

Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Almahri fled to Tanzania and we have worked closely with the local police authorities to trace and arrest him.

'This has been a fast moving and complex investigation involving law enforcement agencies from three continents and we are particularly grateful for the professional cooperation we have received from the Tanzanian police.

'Officers from South Wales Police major crime unit were sent to Tanzania to work with local police officers and were able to trace Almahri's movements over hundreds of kilometres across the country.'

Miss Aburas had travelled to New York for a holiday with Almahri in the past, but it was believed to be the first time that he had met her in Britain. 

It is thought he flew into the UK on Boxing Day and booked a £135-a-night room at the Future Inn hotel for December 30 and New Year's Eve.

He checked into the hotel with Miss Aburas, which is less than a mile away from her flat at 8.25pm on December 30.

The pair went out for an hour before returning at about 11pm.

But police say Almahri left at 3am on New Year's Eve and hours later at around noon, the injured body of Miss Aburas was found by hotel staff.

Detectives then discovered Almahri had quickly booked a flight and flew from Heathrow to Bahrain at 10.30am on New Year's Eve.

He then went to Doha in Qatar before moving on to Tanzania. 

South Wales Police said they couldn't say where Almahri was arrested in the vast East African country - which cover 365,756 square miles - but said the wealthy New York City resident had not been hiding in the capital city of Dodoma.

The spokesman said: 'As I understand it he wasn't arrested in the capital city but somewhere else in the country.'

The spokesman added: 'The next step is extraditing Sammy Almahri from Tanzania and getting him back in the UK.

'We are currently applying for extradition. A decision on charges will then be made after that - we are taking this step by step.'
