Grieving Leroy James senior is comforted today as he visits the scene where his 14-year-old son was stabbed to death

A tearful father today visited the park where his 14-year-old son was stabbed to death close to a crowded playground.

Leroy James's father, Leroy James Snr, was 'in bits' following the stabbing, friends said.

The schoolboy's attackers left him to die in a park and despite paramedics sending an air ambulance to the park in Enfield, north London, he could not be saved.

Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of murdering the teenager.

The boys, aged 14 and 15, are being held in police custody following the stabbing of Leroy James, Scotland Yard said tonight.

The teenager is the youngest of ten children to be murdered in the capital this year,

Horrified witnesses described the youngster as 'sweet' as they said Leroy's father was 'in bits'. Today he visited the scene as forensic officers carried out an investigation.

With two further teenage stabbings on Oxford Street - Britain's busiest shopping area - last night, Scotland Yard moved to dismiss fears that London was in the grip of a wave of gang violence.

Police officers arrived at the scene last night to find the victim slumped by a concrete wall lying in a pool of blood.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode, the investigating officer, said: 'There's certainly no evidence or any intelligence at this time that this is a gang-related murder.'

Roxy Bagun, 19, who lives on the other side of the park, said she saw Leroy's father at the park yesterday evening.

She said: 'His dad was in bits, crying and crying and crying. I just didn't know what to say to him.'

Miss Bagun said Leroy was a 'good lad' who used to play football and basketball with his friends in the park.

'He always used to come and play football,' she said. 'My friend saw it all. He told me how he saw Leroy lying there in a pool of blood.'

She added: 'He was a good lad. I 
never saw him get into any trouble. They were sweet boys. He just hung 
around with kids his own age. His friends are so sweet and innocent.'

She said the killers have 'got no fear any more', adding: 'They had the guts to do it right in front of a police station.'

Detectives said Leroy was in the park with his friends before when he was set upon and stabbed.

Launching a hunt for his attacker, Ms
Goode said: 'We know from what witnesses have told us so far that Leroy
was in an altercation with at least one other boy. I'm completely 
open-minded as to the motive at this stage.

'Officers from the local borough 
arrived very, very quickly and took control of this crime scene, and did
manage to speak to a number of people that were here.

'But we still need to talk to everybody that was present in the park yesterday.

'There were attempts to resuscitate 
Leroy here in the park but sadly those were unsuccessful, and the air 
ambulance played their part in trying to save Leroy's life.'

Relatives are 'absolutely destroyed with the grief at losing their son', she added.

'He was a 14-year-old young man who 
didn't deserve to lose his life. He had his whole life in front of him. A
young man with hopes and aspirations, and that's been tragically cut 
short.'

Friends and schoolmates reacted with shock to the death as hundreds joined a Facebook page set up in his memory.

'Leroy you was like my little brother and i loved you with all my heart,' wrote one friend.

'Im
going to miss not seeing your face everyday and bussing bare jokes. I 
felt i could talk to you about anything and i will always remember the 
things you have done for me. I will never forget you and always love 
you.'

Another
boy added: 'I'm so glad I got the chance to tell you that I love you. I
can't accept that you're gone... Everyone loved you fam.'

Had. I Wish I Cud Bring Dem Memorys Back , Am Gonna Miss You So Much G ,
Nuff Love'.

A witness, who did not want to be named, said: ‘There were a lot of people in the park 
at the time. It happened near some swings where there would have been 
young children playing.

10. August 17: Leroy James, 14, is knifed to death in Enfield

‘I believe that there was a football 
match going on at the time nearby. There must have been a lot of 
witnesses around at the time.

‘I saw a lot of 15-18 year-old kids coming out of the park after the police shut it off. There was a very heavy police presence.

‘It
is shocking. The community has already been hit by the riots. The Tesco
that was looted is only five minutes away from the park.’

She added: ‘The park isn’t a troublespot. Quite often it is empty late at night.

‘We have not had any trouble there for a 
good few years. A neighbour told me a 14-year-old boy had died and some 
teenagers were seen running away.’

No murder weapon has been recovered, but the teenager is thought to have died from a single stab wound.

Ponders End recreational ground where the attack happened, also known as Ryan’s Park, hosts several festivals and was expensively refurbished several years ago.

The nearby A10 retail park, including a branch of Tesco, suffered extensive looting during the rioting last week.

Dozens of youths masked youths rampaged the store, making off with dozens of televisions and bottles of alcohol on Sunday August 7.

Staff at Tesco told how: ‘The windows smashed and they just came pouring in from all four sides.’

On Tuesday police revealed that less than half of the people arrested for the rioting in Enfield live in the borough.

A record number of 29 teenagers were 
murdered in London in 2008, topping the previous worst toll of 27 in 
2007. However, there was a steep decline to just 15 teenage murders in 
the capital in 2009. A total of 19 teenagers were unlawfully killed in 
London last year.

The killing happened just two days after Kelvin
Chibueze, 17, was stabbed to death in Ilford, east London, in the early
hours of Monday morning, following a fight involving up to 20 youths.
