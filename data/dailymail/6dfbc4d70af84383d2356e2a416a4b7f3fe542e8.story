Tony Blair has taken a swipe at Labour leader Ed Miliband – suggesting he had thrown away the chance of a ‘substantial majority' by dragging the party to the left.

The former Prime Minister said a ‘strong’ leader who appealed to voters’ ‘aspiration’ could defeat David Cameron.

Mr Blair’s remarks came after Labour was accused of launching ‘class war’ by attacking private schools and pledging to introduce a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million.

Former Prime Minister said Labour could win a 'substantial majority' from the centre ground of politics

He refused to be drawn on Labour’s struggle in the polls, but said: 'I still believe personally there is still a majority for centre-ground politics in the UK.

‘If you had a strong political lead that was combining the politics of aspiration with the politics of compassion, I still think that’s where you could get a substantial majority.’

The former Prime Minister also urged Mr Miliband not to try to ‘out Ukip Ukip’ by attacking immigration and the European Union.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, he said: 'I’ve always thought that the Labour Party would not lose by standing up strongly for Britain’s membership of the European Union. 

'That’s been my view all the way through. I’m not saying that with the rise of UKIP there isn’t a strong anti-EU vote, there is.’

He added: 'My view is and has been right from the very beginning that the way to deal with a party like UKIP, to analyze their policies, show how destructive they would be.’

He said Labour had to offer policies which focussed on ‘genuinely helping people’ find work rather than blaming Poles for taking jobs.

Mr Blair urged the party not to join Ukip ‘selling people a false and illusory elixir of hope, which is around if you stop more Polish people coming to Britain you’re going to provide more jobs in the poorest communities in the UK’. He added: 'You’re not. That’s not the answer.’

He added: 'I’ve always said the right way to deal with immigration is to have answers to it that meet the concerns people have, but also to point out the positive benefits of immigration.'

Conservative Vice-Chairman Bob Neill MP said Mr Blair’s remarks exposed the growing concern over Mr Miliband’s leadership.

He said: ‘For all his many many faults Tony Blair was still Labour’s most electorally successful leader, but even he thinks Ed Miliband’s just not up to it.

‘Across the country and inside the Labour party people realise that Ed Miliband is a weak leader whose policies of more wasteful spending and higher taxes don’t add up to a credible economic plan.’
