Struggling high streets received a boost after the Government announced a long-awaited review into punishing business rates.

The rise in online shopping has been credited with the demise of the high street, with more than 100 shops closing down every week across the UK.

Business rates, which are charged on bricks and mortar shops, have placed the high street at a further disadvantage to its online rivals.

Around 100 shops close in the UK every week as business moves online, with industry leaders saying unfair rates have been an 'anchor' on growth in their sector (file 

Now, the Chancellor has announced a review into the rates, which are based on the rental value of a building and which cost small business tens of thousands of pounds a year.

Business groups said the way the tax was calculated was ‘outmoded, clunky and regressive’, and that it was an ‘anchor’ on growth and investment on the high street.

George Osborne said he would also continue to cap the increase in business rates at 2 per cent, which is below RPI inflation. 

And for businesses whose rateable value – the annual rental value of the property – is below £50,000, an existing £1,500 discount on business rates will be extended for another year.

Firms will pay no National Insurance for apprentices under the age of 25, Chancellor George Osborne announced yesterday.

This means businesses will not pay the ‘jobs tax’ if they take on young workers and offer them employment and training.

Ministers hope the move will help tackle youth unemployment, with a target of getting three million young people into apprenticeships by the end of the next Parliament.

Nearly two million have taken up such posts since 2010 – a six-fold increase. 

The incentive for hiring apprentices will come into force in 2016, and is expected to cost £105million in the first year.

It will apply to all earnings up to the 40p tax rate of around £42,000. This maximum is to discourage firms from calling highly-paid workers ‘apprentices’ as a way of avoiding tax.

Employers pay NI at a rate of 13.8 per cent on staff earnings. 

In last year’s Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne announced businesses would no longer have to pay National Insurance for any workers under the age of 21 – rules which will come into force from April next year.

In a boost for small businesses looking for loans, the Chancellor also extended the Funding for Lending scheme until 2016. 

Banks will receive up to £500million at cheap rates in return for lending to small firms.

The moves were praised by shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants, although many expressed disappointment that the findings for the review would not be presented until 2016. 

Simon Tivey, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The extension of the tax relief will be welcome but I think waiting another year for any major changes to business rates will be disappointing for many.

‘The business rates system has been unchanged since 1988 and, in its current form, there are lots of elements which are starting to grate. It is well overdue for an upgrade.’

While shops pay high business rates for premises in central areas and high footfall, companies such as Amazon – which has a huge warehouse in South Wales, where land is cheaper – pay much lower rates. 

There are also anomalies in the system which leave some large retailers and department stores paying less than smaller businesses for their high street stores. 

Last year, the Mail reported that a fashion boutique in Rochdale had been forced out of its shop by sky-high business rates that saw it charged more per square metre than Harrods. 

Critics also claim that because the current rateable values are based on 2008 rental prices – at the peak of the property market – they are no longer applicable to some areas of the UK which are still recovering from the economic crisis.

Stuart Adam, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘The fact that bricks and mortar businesses are based in high-value, high-tax areas, while online retailers do not need such a physical presence, does penalise the high street.

‘The business rates system is badly designed and there is lots of room for improvement.’

John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, added: ‘Businesses will be encouraged by the Government’s continued efforts to curb business rate increases.

'Firms will also be pleased to hear the Chancellor announce a review into the future structure of Britain’s business rates system.

‘This iniquitous tax is the highest in Europe and a drag anchor on investment and growth.’ 

A study of 500 town centres across Britain showed 3,000 outlets closed in the first six months of this year, while 2,600 opened.

According to the Valuation Office Agency, business rates raised £20.5billion last year. The money is used to help pay for local services, such as police and firefighters.

Julie Deane, who founded the Cambridge Satchel Company, welcomed George Osborne’s decision to review the structure of business rates and his invitation for business groups to contribute to discussions.

The 47-year-old sells brightly coloured leather satchels – popular with stars such as singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and model Alexa Chung – from four British stores and says that a big selling point for her brand is that they are manufactured in the UK.

But she added that selling from the UK meant she faced pressure from competitors abroad and online who did not have to pay the same business rates and thus were able to keep costs down.

Mrs Deane said: ‘George Osborne said there would be a review of business rates overall and I think that’s a good idea.

‘I’m really hoping to see more investment in UK manufacturing and not penalising people with business rates.

'What it means when our overheads are so very, very out of kilter with other countries is that it stagnates our potential for growth.’

The business has a factory in Leicestershire and each day makes more than 1,000 satchels to be sold in more than 100 countries.

The former stay-at-home mother said the freeze in business rates at 2 per cent will help her firm, which has a turnover of £13million and employs 120 staff, but she would appreciate more measures to help medium-sized businesses as well as smaller ones.

‘It’s great that there’s so much support for small businesses,’ she said.

‘But there’s also problems associated with being in the middle ground, as we are.

‘Scale-up businesses could contribute one million new jobs to the economy by 2034, so I just hope that we can get the support we need too.’
