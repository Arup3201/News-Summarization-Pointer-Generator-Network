Niall Horan, one fifth of the world's biggest boyband One Direction, was at the iPro Stadium on Tuesday night to cheer on Derby. 

Despite growing up in Ireland, he supports the club because of his dad, who pledged allegiance when Brian Clough ruled the roost. 

Horan has attended matches in the past – including the 2007 Championship play-off final – and was in a box here after performing on Sunday's X Factor final in London, alongside Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, wearing a Rams earpiece.

Real Madrid had an interest in the match through Omar Mascarell, who is on loan at Derby from the Spanish giants. 

Jose Mourinho knows the midfielder. He gave Mascarell his first-team debut in his last match at the Bernabeu in June 2013, replacing Mesut Ozil with nine minutes left of a 4-2 win over Osasuna.

Jose Mourinho went mad at the people carrying the stretcher onto the pitch as Kurt Zouma lay stricken on the floor, physically pushing two of the quartet to hurry up. 

Cesc Fabregas and Cesar Azpilicueta then ran over to drag them along quicker. It was odd to see such medical staff walking but the doctors were already tending to Zouma and did not look in immediate need of the stretcher. 

Mourinho has history of agitation in similar circumstances, of course, attacking the Ambulance Service for the time taken to arrive at Reading's Madejski Stadium to collect Petr Cech in 2006. His claims were later rebuked.

Richard Keogh was culpable for Chelsea's opening goal, just as his error led to Bobby Zamora scoring QPR's winner in May's Championship play-off final. 

His slip here allowed Cesc Fabregas to pick up his 15th assist of the season, 10 more than any other Chelsea player. 

Away fans cruelly taunted Keogh, chanting 'Are you Gerrard in disguise?' He did make amends of sorts with two excellent challenges on Didier Drogba in dangerous positions.
