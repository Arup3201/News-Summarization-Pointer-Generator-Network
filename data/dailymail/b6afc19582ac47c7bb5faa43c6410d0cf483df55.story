A tailgate decal on the back of a truck that shows a woman to be bound and tied in the back, is causing a bit stir in Texas.

At first glance, the optical illusion given off by the decal is so convincing that it really does appear that there is a woman in the back.

The sticker is the work of Hornet Signs, a marketing and advertising company in Waco.

Truck trick: The decal has resulted in a number of people calling 911 after thinking there really might be a woman in the back

All is revealed: It really is empty! See?

According to Brad Kolb, the owner of the company, the sticker was put on an employeeâ€™s truck to gauge how realistic their decals are.

'I wasn't expecting the reactions we got, nor do we condone this by any means,' Mr Kolb told KWTX.

'It was more or less something we put out there to see who noticed it.'

Mr Kolb said an employee volunteered to be tied up and was photographed so the decal could be made.

It was put on the employees truck about a month ago.

Mr Kolb says that orders for tailgate decals have gone up since the sticker appeared on the streets, however he has received a barrage of people saying the image is in poor taste.

The company specializes in car wrap advertising and they decided to experiment with tailgate decals using unusual images, including a sniper and zombie.

However, it is the kidnapped woman who has attracted the most attention.

KWTX said it asked viewers what they thought of Kolb's marketing stunt, and the responses the station received were almost all negative in their stance.

Some viewers said they even called the police when they saw the decal, thinking a woman was truly in trouble.

One viewer said, 'Abduction or any violence against women is not funny or cute.'

Only a few voiced opinions of support, 'This American business owner has a decal that made the news. Like it or not, it works.'
