The Football Association has written to Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion over what the governing body calls ‘disturbing crowd incidents’ during Saturday’s shameful FA Cup tie.

In a statement the FA says all video footage will be studied to identify culprits and ‘ensure they face appropriate punishment’.

Tony Pulis has called for West Brom fans found guilty of ripping up seats at Villa Park to receive lifetime bans, while similar sanctions are likely to befall home fans who goaded and shoved opposition players.

Villa face the prospect of a significant fine for failing to control their fans over three pitch invasions and the FA will want to establish whether any negligence was the cause.

Villa have already issued an unreserved apology over the scenes at the end of a game which saw 17 people arrested overall.

An FA statement read: ‘The FA has contacted both Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion to request their observations in relation to the disturbing crowd incidents which occurred during and after their FA Cup quarter-final tie on 7 March 2015.

‘As well as liaising with both clubs, The FA is working closely with West Midlands Police and notes that a number of arrests have already been made.

‘All available video footage will be studied by the relevant parties to identify anyone who has committed a disorder offence inside the stadium and ensure they face the appropriate punishment.

‘Whilst its investigation continues, The FA will make no further comment.’

A Villa statement read: 'Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and West Midlands Police are all working together to investigate events which took place both during and after Saturday's FA Cup match.

'The Club will also cooperate fully with the Football Association. There will be no further comment until all inquiries are complete.’ 

The national lead officer for football policing questioned the scheduling of the match, which kicked off at 5.30pm. 

'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 

'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. 

'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor.

'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good.

'If you're looking at whether alcohol was a factor, there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game, people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly, being drunk seeking entry to a football ground.

'If you looked at the people who came onto the pitch, a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and I don't think there is any coincidence that where there's alcohol involved, people's behaviour tends to deteriorate.'

He added: 'I do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick-off to meet the BBC's scheduling.

'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously.

'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.'

Villa issued an apology for their fans' behaviour while West Brom vowed to take a 'zero tolerance' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the FA inquiry.

And Baggies boss Tony Pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats.

'If that was the situation, and they've got CCTV cameras up there, those supporters should never come into another football ground. It is like people coming into someone else's house - you have to show respect.'

Pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch.

He added: 'I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that. I don't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game.

'If one thing, Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30pm, you need to police it properly, and I am sure Villa will look at it.'
