The moment thieves chased a terrified puppy in front of a family's home - before stealing the valuable pooch - was captured by a neighbour's CCTV camera.

Peaches, a seven-month-old pug, was bought to cheer up Ellis Barrett, six, after he came out of hospital in February.

The little boy has spent the last four years undergoing surgery after contracting septicaemia, following a horrific incident when he was scalded with hot water.

Now he has been left heartbroken by the news that his 'best friend' has been taken from him, said his mother Lucy Swift.

'He’s devastated she’s gone and all we want is to find her.'

Miss Swift, 29, worked extra shifts as a carer for the elderly until she 
saved the money to buy the pug, which can cost between £800 and £1200.

'Ellis had been asking for a pug for months but when I saw how expensive they were I couldn’t believe it,' she said.

'I worked as much as I could to get her 
and when Ellis came out of hospital in February I could 
finally give him his pug.'

The valuable pet was stolen from the family home in Batley, West Yorkshire, on Sunday afternoon after she had been let out into the front garden.

Footage from a neighbour’s CCTV camera captured two hooded men brazenly walking into garden.

They were filmed chasing Peaches as she tried to run away, before scooping her into their arms and making a getaway.

'I was heartbroken when I found out,' said Miss Swift.

'Thousands of people have been in touch with me to try and help and I’ve 
told anyone that if they think they see her out to shout Peaches.

'When anyone calls her name she gets so excited and so giddy that she pees so people will know it is her.'

The distraught mother explained that the beloved pet isn't microchipped as the dog was too small when she was first taken to the vet.

Miss Swift, who has another son Mason, 11, has started a Facebook page in the hope someone will recognise the stolen animal.

The 'Help my son find his pug Peaches' page is filled with photographs of the Ellis with puppy and details of how to get in touch with information.

She added: 'Peaches has got a medical condition and she’s a very small pug.

'She sits in the basket of the pink pram outside and is really lazy. She won’t run around, she’s such little diva.'

West Yorkshire Police are appealing for information following the theft.

'Enquiries are ongoing regarding this theft and we would like to speak with anyone who has information about Peaches whereabouts or who may have seen the persons who took her,' saidPC Nick O’Meila, of West Yorkshire Police.
