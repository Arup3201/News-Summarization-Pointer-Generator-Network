Swindler: Jordan Belfort is reportedly renting a $4 million beachfront mansion in California, despite owing nearly $100 million to his victims

Jordan Belfort's life story skyrocketed to the top of the box office, but the meteoric rise hasn't outrun his current reality.

The
 U.S. government has moved to take control of two Hermosa Beach, 
California, mansions said to possibly be owned by 51-year-old 
Belfort - properties he has long-insisted he rents.

Documents
 obtained by TMZ show the feds action is an attempt to claw back more 
money towards the $110million restitution owed by the convicted con 
artist.

Previous reports suggested that at least one of the homes is worth a cool $4million.

The
 report comes only days after news that LR Credit, based in New York, 
obtained a judgment against Belfort for $27,597 from unpaid retail 
purchases Belfort made during the height of his hedonistic lifestyle in 
the 1990s, reports TMZ.

Belfort
 temporarily avoided paying that judgement by fleeing to glitzy 
Manhattan Beach, where he reportedly rents another glamorous mansion.

The collection agency has since filed new legal documents to make their NY judgment enforceable in California.Â 

The
 former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to 
his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid 
just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property.

The
 staggering sum was agreed to as part of his punishment for running the 
Long Island-based 'boiler room' brokerage Stratton Oakmont alongside 
co-defendant Danny Porush.

The
 pair and others made their millions by 'pumping and dumping' shares 
after high-pressure sales calls to investors led them to
 unwittingly buy the stocks - causing their price to rise - allowing 
Belfort and co to dump them at a large profit.

They raked in a known $200million from the fraud, which they spent on
 cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel.

The FBI caught up with them in 1996, and Belfort eventually spent 22 months in prison. Porush was sentenced to 39 months.

Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s

Belfort has written a pair of 
memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and
 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street.

The
 first was named after a nickname given to Belfort after a magazine 
article profiling his firm - which even handled the initial public 
offering for Steve Madden's shoe company.

Madden also did time in jail on securities fraud charges stemming from the Stratton Oakmont investigation.

Red Granite Productions paid Belfort $1.045 million for the rights to his best seller story in 2011.

But Belfort paid only $21,000 in restitution that year, according to the government.

He has claimed many times, including during a contentious interview on 'Piers Morgan Live,'
 that he has never profited from the book or the movie, and that he has 
paid much more towards the restitution than was required.

'I
 am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally
 content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better 
than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29.

'For
 the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and 
the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I
 insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the 
movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. 
This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be 
more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added.

New career: The former stockbroker owes victims $110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution

Prosecutors say Belfort
 is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees 
from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker.

In
 addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to 
Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income.

'We
 want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the 
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.'

'The
 government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of 
Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would 
yield, in his words, "countless millions," much less the approximately 
$100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said.

Belfort's
 lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for 
work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California.

Dispute: Prosecutors say Belfort and his partner have relocated to Australia to avoid paying back what he owes, but his lawyer says the pair are based in California

Belfort's Facebook page
 tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from 
April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London 
and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where 
he's apparently spent most of his time up until now.

His most recent posts appear to come from and be centered around Australia.

The U.S. government contends that 
Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, 
but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with 
the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is 
now over.

Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes.

'He's made payments as 
he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis.
 'He has never run from his obligations.'
