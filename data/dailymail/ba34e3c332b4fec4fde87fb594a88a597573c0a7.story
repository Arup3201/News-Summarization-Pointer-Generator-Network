Colombian international James Rodriguez has asked fans not to compare him to Cristiano Ronaldo, saying he would never be able to live up to his team-mate.

Rodriguez joined Real Madrid from Monaco for £63million in the summer, and after winning the Golden Boot at the World Cup, some fans expected him to try and emulate the feats of his new team-mate.

Ronaldo has averaged more than one goal per game since moving to the Spanish giants back in 2009, but while Rodriguez admitted he can score goals, he said he will never be on the same level as last year's Ballon d'Or winner.

'I knew that I had to adapt to Real Madrid, but I also knew that I could still improve and raise my game,' the Colombia international told Cadena Ser.

'I am not a goalscorer, though. Of course, I like to score goals, but I'm no Cristiano Ronaldo who scores 60 goals per season.

'Cristiano is the best player in the world for me. He's a goalscoring machine and a true superstar. What stands out most, however, is that he is a great person as well.

'All the players at Madrid have a lot of quality, but the one who has surprised me the most is Isco. I really like his style of play.'
