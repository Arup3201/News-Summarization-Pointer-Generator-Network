Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has played down the injury suffered by star man Cristiano Ronaldo against rivals Atletico in Tuesday night's Super Cup first leg. 

The Portugal international was replaced at half-time after he was seen to hold his back as the two sides walked off the field for the interval.

Madrid boss Ancelotti confirmed after the game that Ronaldo will go for tests on Wednesday.

The Italian said: ‘Cristiano had strain and was not comfortable. Tests tomorrow. At first it does not seem so serious.’

Madrid's new £60million signing James Rodriguez was the man to come on for Ronaldo and scored his first goal for Real to put the European champions ahead before Raul Garcia equalised for Diego Simeone's men.

Ronaldo's World Cup in Brazil was hampered by a knee injury as Portugal crashed out at the Group stage in Brazil this summer.
