A man and a woman have died after their car was crushed by a lorry in a motorway smash.

The horrific accident forced the full closure of the westbound carriageway at junction 26 in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire where the Mercedes truck collided with the white Audi A5.

The occupants of the Audi, a 46-year-old man and a 43-year-old woman, both believed to be from Bishop Auckland, Durham, died at the scene after the truck overturned onto the back half of their car.

Deadly drive: Both occupants of the white Audi died at the scene after they collided with a truck on the M62 westbound at 5.50am today

Overturned truck: While police are investigating the circumstances that led to the Audi being crushed under the truck, the truck driver was sent to hospital for minor injuries

The road closure, which has now been in place for more than 10 hours, is causing massive traffic delays with gridlock reported in Birkenshaw, Liversedge, Heckmondwike, Mirfield and Ravensthorpe as a result.

A police spokesman said that the road closures are expected to continue until later today while they investigate the cause of the crash.

While police do not know exactly how the crash happened, long skid marks and scattered debris at the scene of the accident suggest that speed played a factor in the fatal collision.

The truck driver, a 43-year-old man from North East Lincolnshire, Yorkshire was taken to hospital for minor injuries.

The Major Collision Enquiry Team (MCET) is appealing for witnesses to assist with their investigations.

Sgt
Garry Alderson of MCET said: ‘Clearly this was a very serious incident 
which has sadly resulted in the deaths of the man and woman travelling 
in the Audi.

‘We are 
conducting a full collision investigation at the scene and obviously 
this will take time given the seriousness of the incident.

‘I
would advise drivers to avoid the area if at all possible while 
recovery work is underway and would ask anyone who saw the incident or 
either of the vehicles described shortly beforehand to contact the Major
Collision Enquiry Team on 01924 293047.’

Witnesses: Police are appealing for witnesses who saw the accident or the vehicles shortly beforehand to come forward to help with their investigations

All day gridlock: The crash meant the M62 westbound at junction 26 has been closed since the early morning crash resulting in traffic in towns more than eight miles away
