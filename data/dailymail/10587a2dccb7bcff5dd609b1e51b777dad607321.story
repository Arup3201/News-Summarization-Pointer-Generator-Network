Swansea City will dig their heels in to prevent unhappy Bafetimbi Gomis from plunging the club into a major striker crisis this month.

Sportsmail has been told by senior sources at the club that despite their anger with the Frenchman’s apparent agitations for a move, they are forced by sheer necessity to keep the 29-year-old, who is Swansea’s only senior striker in the wake of Wilfried Bony’s exit.

However, that marriage of convenience does not remove any of the ill-feeling caused on Sunday when Gomis used a television interview in France to indicate promises of playing time had been broken. He also said he planned discussions with his representatives to ‘find the best solution’.

The striker has scored just once in 18 Premier League appearances this season, making only six starts

Senior members of the club’s hierarchy feel they are being ‘held to ransom’ and have been stunned by the timing of the striker’s comments, which came after Bony’s move to Manchester City had cleared the way for a regular starting berth in the side.

Gomis’s remarks have been noted by Crystal Palace, who are actively keen, while his camp have also claimed that Arsenal, Newcastle, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke are interested.

The Welsh club would have to pay Gomis the rest of his £8m signing-on fee as part of his transfer from Lyon

But Swansea insist there will be no move, and even in the unlikely event that they are able to sign a senior striker before the transfer window closes, there would still be major obstacles to offloading Gomis.

Namely, Swansea are obligated to pay him the remainder of his £8m signing-on fee agreed as part of his Bosman transfer from Lyon last summer. The huge sum is to be spread across his four-year, £55,000-a-week contract, with £1m of the signing fee believed to have already been paid.

He is due the balance of that fee regardless of whether he leaves now or later, though there would likely be a settlement in the event that an acceptable offer came from a rival club.

The Frenchman claims that Swansea broke their promise of an agreed amount of playing time

Gomis, who has scored only once in 18 Premier League appearances, of which only six have been starts, told Canal Plus at the weekend: ‘When Bony was here, it was planned I should play a certain number of games. That wasn't the case. Today, I ask myself many questions. I need time to think.

‘I have been approached by clubs. I don't know what will happen. Me leaving? It is possible.’

Swansea, meanwhile, have agreed a fee worth close to £5m for Tottenham full-back Kyle Naughton.
