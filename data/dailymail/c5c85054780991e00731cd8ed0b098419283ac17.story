'International man of mystery' Peter Foster is on the run from the law after a judge found him guilty of another weight-loss scam

Conman Peter Foster – the central figure in the 2002 ‘Cheriegate’ scandal – was hiding from the law last night after a judge found him guilty of yet another weight-loss scam.

The 52-year-old Australian, ex-boyfriend of Cherie Blair’s former fitness guru Carole Caplin, failed to turn up for a court hearing in Brisbane yesterday amid claims that he was planning to flee on a luxury yacht to the Cook Islands in the Pacific.

But last night the 72ft motor yacht Next Adventure was still moored on the Queensland Gold Coast and the whereabouts of the self-professed ‘international man of mystery’ remained unknown.

The manhunt that has now started is yet another dramatic episode in the life and times of Foster, who wormed his way into the lives of then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie 13 years ago by first forming a relationship with Miss Caplin.

Through her he became Mrs Blair’s ‘financial adviser’ and managed to help her purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price.

When she learned of his notoriety as a conman in the slimming industry she at first denied he was involved in helping her – until the Daily Mail provided emails from her to him in which she described him as ‘a star’ and said ‘we are on the same wavelength, Peter’.

Yesterday, with a warrant out for Foster’s arrest, calls to his mobile went unanswered.

Earlier in the day, Justice John Logan delivered a long-awaited judgment, finding Foster guilty of contempt by becoming secretly involved in Sensaslim, a weight-loss nasal spray which scientists said was ineffective and advertisements claiming it worked were based on false evidence.

He had previously been ordered not to become involved in the weight loss industry.

Foster
was also found to have shown contempt of court yesterday by failing to 
show up for the judgment in the Queensland Federal Court.

The
judge, acknowledging that Foster’s ageing mother Louise was recovering 
from a stroke, gave him until 5pm to hand himself in to a police 
station, which he failed to do.

Anticipating a guilty finding, Foster sent a letter to the court yesterday saying his mother was ill and he was in ‘understandable discomfort’ about the outcome of the hearing.

He denied he was planning to flee, writing: ‘I would never abandon my mother, especially in her frail state of health.’

Foster made – and lost – millions of pounds with his slimming products by selling franchises.

But the slimming industry has also been his downfall and cons associated with it have resulted in him being locked up in Britain, the US and Australia.

Now Justice Logan has warned that he faces more jail time in Australia for the two acts of contempt.
