The horrifying seconds of a crocodile trainer fighting for his life as hysterical zoo visitors helplessly watch on has been captured on video.

Feeding time for John, the crocodile, in his enclosure at Shoalhaven Zoo on Monday descended into a horror show when Trent Burton was almost dragged to his death by his 3.7m reptile pal.

Mr Burton, is seen in the footage, taken by a disturbed onlooker, coaxing the crocodile to snap up the fresh piece of steak he is waving in front of him.

Trent Burton coaxes John the crocodile with a juicy piece of steak at feeding time at Shoalhaven Zoo

But it all took a turn for the worst after Mr Burton jabbed at the meat in the crocodile's jaw and his left hand disappeared into the animal's jaw

John happily obliges before latching onto Mr Burton's left hand when he decided to jab at the meat firmly clasped in the crocodile's jaw.

Mr Burton was dragged by the hand into the water and slammed into the fence, but managed to break free and jump the fence when the crocodile released his clasp after the trainer fell on his head.

The screaming school holiday crowd were immediately reassured by the unusually composed trainer: 'everyone calm down' he can be heard saying as soon as he was in the all clear on the other side of the fence.

Mr Burton escaped the ordeal with 3 – 4 tooth punctures and a 10cm gash in the palm of the left hand and a broken knuckle on his right hand. He underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair his left hand.

Mr Burton, 31, who has been handling crocodiles for more than a decade, admitted to Seven News that it was a 'rookie' error when touching the steak in John's mouth.

'A very dumb small brain fart on my part - it seems more dumb when you watch it,' he said. ' I was fighting for my life.'

Shoalhaven Zoo owner Nick Schilko told MailOnline on Monday that 'Trent was just happy that he had feeling in his hand and could move his fingers'.

'We are just thankful that he is alright. He had a little bit of damage to his right hand that had a few stitches but his left hand needs specialist treatment,' he said.

'Trent was feeding the croc... He flipped the food at his (the crocodile’s) face. He caught it in his mouth and as he’s tried to flick it up to put it in his mouth further, Trent tried to reached and take it out of his mouth,' Mr Schilko said.

'He was beating himself up over what he did. Basically his hand got caught in the moment... the crocodile has gone bonus and started backing up to the water and dragged him all the way into the water'

He managed to scramble out of the water and away from John the croc as a shocked school holiday crowd watched on

'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. I've seen them in the wild and at Steve Irwin's zoo but never anything like this,' Marlene Orr, from Shellharbour, said on Monday.

Mr Burton was treated at the zoo by paramedics before being taken to hospital with puncture wounds to his hands.

It's not known when Mr Burton will be back working at the zoo, but Mr Schilko said the crocodile handler would want to be back soon.

'He’s not a sook so he wants to be back at work as soon as possible. I will allow him to come back to work whenever the doctors say he can,' he said.

The handler was holding out a piece of meat during the show when the crocodile snapped it up before he was supposed to, according to one woman in the crowd
