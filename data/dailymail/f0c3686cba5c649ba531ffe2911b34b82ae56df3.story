A British inventor is hoping to turn the world of the humble umbrella on its head after designing one that folds inwards to stop water dripping onto the floor.

Rather than creating pools of rainwater when it is put away, like normal umbrellas, the Kazbrella folds the opposite way, collecting drips inside it.

It also solves the problem of poking passers-by in the head with an umbrella's spokes because it opens from the top rather than the bottom.

A British inventor is hoping to turn the world of the umbrella upside down after designing one that folds inwards (pictured) to stop water dripping onto the floor

According to its inventor, Jenan Kazim, it means users can stay dry for longer by putting their umbrellas down once inside, avoiding damage by strong gusts of wind.

Mr Kazim, an aeronautical engineer, came up with the idea after his mother-in-law complained her regular umbrella had dripped all over the floor of her house.

He has been accused of trying to reinvent the wheel - but he claims his invention could be the future for the much-needed umbrella.

The device is now in the final design process before being put into production in a few months' time and is expected to cost around £45 ($75).

The Kazbrella turns inside out leaving the dry side of the canopy on the outside.

To close the umbrella, users pull it up, instead of pulling it down, as is the case with a normal brolly.

This captures the dripping water within so it doesn't make the surroundings wet.

The website claims it does this by using 'patented' folds that change the way the umbrella opens and closes

It will cost around £45 ($75) when it is launched later this year.

Mr Kazim, 61, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: 'A number of years ago my mother-in-law was walking into her house from the rain with her umbrella.

'She put it down as she came into the house and stood it up on its end like normal but it dripped water all over her floor.'

To close the umbrella you pull it up, instead of pulling it down as is the case with a normal brolly.

 'I'm an engineer by trade and it got me thinking about what I could do to remedy the problem,' said Mr Kazim.

'The initial idea to turn the conventional design upside down so that it closes in on itself came pretty quickly, but it took me some time to work out how I was going to do it.

'Kazbrella won't drip on your floor once you come in out of the rain and, unlike normal brollies, you don't have to lift it way above people's heads to put it up.

'It won't poke people in the face, you can put it down once you're sat inside a car to make sure you stay dry for longer, and it can't be blown inside out by the wind because it's already inside out.

'Umbrellas have been around for 3,000 years and some people have said I'm trying to reinvent the wheel but what I'm actually doing is evolving a design which is great but has flaws.

'The Kazbrella has the same iconic look as a normal umbrella but it resolves some of the problems that have beset umbrellas for millennia.'
