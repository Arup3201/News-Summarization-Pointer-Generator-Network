Jobless Britons should be made to pick fruit on farms or face having their benefits taken away, the Farming Minister said yesterday.

George Eustice insisted there would be no replacement for the Seasonal Agricultural Workers scheme that provided 22,000 foreigners a year with temporary permits to enter Britain to harvest crops. It was scrapped in September.

Instead, local unemployed people should be recruited to do the work, he said.

British jobs: George Eustice was criticised for telling farmers British workers should take priority

But the proposal has sparked fury 
among farmers -  who say British jobseekers have a ‘work ethic problem’ 
which means people simply refuse to do hard manual labour.

The farmers insisted yesterday that 
reliable foreign workers are vital for the industry and that foreign 
migrant labour has fulfilled their needs for generations.

Mr Eustice told the National Farmers' Union conference in Birmingham: ‘I know that some people would say you won’t get them to do this work, they don’t want to do it.

'As a government we shouldn’t really tolerate that attitude that says we are going to pay people to stay on benefits because they don’t want to do certain types of farming work.’

Now farmers fear not being able to recruit enough staff to take in this year’s harvest.

Some said Romanians and Bulgarians, who used 
to do much of Britain's harvest work, now prefer to work in factories, construction 
and catering because of their new employment rights.

NFU president Peter Kendall accused the Government of attempting a ‘social engineering experiment’.

‘Just because the Government says people should do farm work doesn’t mean they are going to do it,’ he said.

Hops and apple farmer Alison Capper, who lives near Worcester, said: 'We have a work ethic problem in this country... Every year we put out adverts and we try to recruit locally for the harvest. We are lucky if we get three replies for 50 jobs.

‘If you do manage to employ local people, by day five 70 to 80 per cent of them stop turning up. We have a huge dropout rate.

‘They can’t keep up with Polish workers and they drop out.

‘We need to... go back to a position where anyone could come and work.

‘The
 benefit of the scheme was that they were guaranteed a job, they would 
come for a given period of time and they went home again.’

‘With
 the 2014 harvest this now means more expensive recruitment and much 
higher turnover of harvest staff, more costly training and more costly 
administration.

Hard work: At up to £8 an hour, fruit picking pays better than some jobs but has erratic hours and conditions

‘It is a 
perfectly normal phenomenon that people from poorer countries travel to 
harvest richer countries’ fruit and veg. It is a fact of life. It might 
not be a very nice fact of life but it happens all over the world, not 
just in the UK.’

Mr Eustice, who is Conservative MP for
 the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth, said: ‘We don’t think
 it is acceptable that people who could work do not because they think 
there is something unglamorous about farm work.

A government report last year said: 'Growers tried to recruit British workers but without success'

‘We are doing a 
number of things, including getting people who live locally to take some
 of these jobs, to make sure it’s factored into the work that DWP is 
doing.

‘Sometimes the barrier is that people feel it is not worth coming off 
benefits for a month or six weeks because they then have the difficulty 
of getting back on those benefits. That is something we are trying to 
address.’

Mr Eustice, whose
 family ran a strawberry farm in Cornwall in the 1990s, added: ‘Frankly, 
we need to try to make sure we make it easier for people who live 
locally who are on benefits but could work to take these jobs in 
agriculture.

‘I know, having worked in farming myself, how challenging that can be.’

Migration Watch UK, which backed scrapping the scheme, said: ‘It’s hard to see why someone fit to work should not work on a farm, rather than just living on benefits.’

The Government’s independent Migration Advisory Committee last year warned about the impact of scrapping seasonal work permits.

In a report on the subject, it said: ‘All the operators and growers we spoke to stated that they had tried to recruit, and retain, British workers but without success. The farms are not normally in high unemployment areas, British workers are reluctant to live on the farm and growers state that British workers either cannot or will not work at the intensity required to earn the agricultural minimum wage.’

Agricultural work pays slightly higher than other unskilled labour, at £7.50 to £8.00 an hour compared to the minimum wage of £6.31, but workers are put off by the hard outdoor work and rural locations.
