Nick Clegg today insisted he had never considered quitting despite leading the Lib Dems into an election bloodbath, losing all but one of the party’s MEPs.

In a near wipeout at the ballot box, the pro-EU Lib Dems lost 11 of its 12 seats in Brussels, after Mr Clegg campaigned hard as the leader of the ‘party of in’.

But in an apparently emotional interview this afternoon, Mr Clegg insisted the ‘gutting’ result had not led him to consider is position, vowing instead to ‘finish the job’.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg refused to resign after the 'gutting' election results saw all but one of the party's MEPs ousted

The Lib Dems slumped to fifth place in the national share of the vote – to just 7 per cent, behind the Greens.

After starting the night with 12 MEPs, the party was reduced to a rump of just one - Catherine Bearder in the South East.

While jubilant UKIP celebrated stunning victory – topping the poll and securing 24 MEPS - the Lib Dems were plunged into fresh turmoil with Mr Clegg clinging to his job.

His high stakes gamble to take on Mr Farage in two head-to-head TV debates appears to have dramatically backfired.

Speaking from Liberal Democrat headquarters in central London, Mr Clegg said: ‘It didn't work but it was right that we stood up for the values we believe in.

‘I'm immensely proud to lead the most united, resilient and toughest party in British politics.'

% share of the vote

With 11 of the 12 regions of the UK declared, UKIP has gained 11 seats, with Labour up seven, the Tories down seven and the Lib Dems down 10

Mr Clegg went on: ‘We made a big commitment to the British people in 2010 to step up to the plate, to form a government, to reform and repair the damaged British economy and to deliver policy after policy after policy that the Liberal Democrats have been campaigning on for generations. That is what we must continue to do. We must finish the job.’

"f I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership... then I wouldn't hesitate advocating it"

Pitching the Lib Dems as the true voice of pro-EU politics in Britain, Mr Clegg saw his MEPs wiped.

Around 250 Lib Dems – including candidates, councillors and MPs – have signed a letter calling for him to resign.

Mr Clegg went on: ‘If I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership, changing strategy, changing approaches, bailing out now, changing direction, then I wouldn't hesitate advocating it. Absolutely not.’

Asked if he has a bunker mentality, he replied: ‘No, not at all’, adding: ‘I'm never going to put myself ahead of the Liberal Democrats.’

In the popular share of the vote the Lib Dems slumped to just 6.87 per cent, barely half what it achieved in 2009.

Lib Dem MP John Pugh has called for Vince Cable to take over as leader to stem the loss of public support

Lib Dem president Tim Farron said the results were 'as bad as I feared' as it faced losing all of its MEPS.

Treasury minister Danny Alexander added: 'It has been a pretty awful night for the Liberal Democrats.'

But former MP Sandra Gidley said the Lib Dem brand had become ‘toxic’.

Lib Dem MP John Pugh said he wanted Business Secretary Vince Cable to take over as leader, warning that a fundamental cause of the Lib Dems' ‘abysmal’ showing was the fact that voters were no longer willing to listen to Mr Clegg.

If we carry on as usual, we are like the generals at the Somme, because these losses are horrendous,’ the Southport MP told the BBC News Channel. ‘Given the scale of the losses, to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous.’

Mr Clegg rejected the criticism: ‘Of course, it is right to have searching questions in the wake of such a bad set of election results, but if I'm honest the easiest thing in politics, just as in life, sometimes when the going gets really tough is just to walk away, to wash your hands of it. I'm not going to do that and my party is not going to do that.

‘At the point when our big decisions, our big judgments are being vindicated, we are not going to buckle, we are not going to lose our nerve. We are not going to walk away.

‘We must argue over and over and over again that if it wasn't for the Liberal Democrats taking that brave decision at considerable short-term cost...we wouldn't have a recovery now and more than that you wouldn't have the kind of recovery.

‘There's just no way the Conservatives left to their own devices could deliver the big changes.’
