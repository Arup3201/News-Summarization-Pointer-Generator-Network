A motorist in California claims that a gas pump continued to take his money after it stop dispensing fuel, with video evidence to prove it.

Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened and quickly whipped his phone out to record the 'scam'.

Footage shows a price sign on the pump continuing to creep up at the rate of around one cent every three seconds despite the nozzle being outside of the vehicle not dispensing gas.

Maya apparently told Costco staff  about what had happened and showed them his film.

They reported that they'd been having similar problems with another pump.

Maya said he was outraged over the extra charges.

'I feel this is stealing, even though it's some change coming out of my account, but it adds up when you have hundreds of people that may not check throughout the day.'

He uploaded his video to YouTube to serve as a warning to other drivers.

'When you're done pumping, check to see if it's still taking your money when it shouldn't, no matter what gas station,' Maya advised.

According to the gas nozzle manufacturer Husky, there are many causes behind the phenomenon known as 'meter creep'.

It can indicate that parts on the pump need replacing or there is a problem inside the dispenser. 

Fuel dispensers are subject to stringent requirements regarding safety, accuracy and security. 

The exact details differ between countries. Almost all California counties by law inspect gasoline pumps at least once per year.

However, in Arizona checks are completed every four years unless there is a complaint. Maya says he will be more vigilant for 'meter creep' from now on. 'This isn't OK,' he concluded.
