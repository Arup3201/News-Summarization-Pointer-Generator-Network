A leaked version of the Oakland Raiders’ cheerleading squad handbook has been labeled as ‘unbelievably sexist’ and ‘illegal’.

Excerpts from the secret etiquette handbook were obtained and published by The Los Angeles Times, many of which outline how ‘Raiderettes’ must behave while eating in public and socializing with team players.

Criticized for being more concerned with the Raiderette’s reputations than their safety, the handbook outlines rules for fraternizing with advice on how to avoid getting caught in a ‘date rape’ scandal – rather than how to avoid the assault itself.

Strict code: A handbook provided to the Oakland Raiders' 'Raiderette' cheerleading squad has been leaked, and subsequently called-out for its 'unbelievably sexist' rules

In
 excerpts published by the paper, the squad handbook’s dating advice 
reads: ‘There have been a few relationships between the two groups that 
have resulted in a few happy marriages and lovely children. HOWEVER, we 
have also had more situations where, quite frankly, the Raider 
organization and the Raiderettes narrowly escaped ruined reputations.’

It
 continues: ‘One such example concerns a player who gave Halloween 
parties every year and many of the Raiderettes attended. This same 
player was suspended from the team for drug use but also arrested for 
date rape. For you on the squad who have attended those parties, just 
think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers 
and/or being assaulted.’

Of
 this, feminist-geared website Jezebel commented: ‘The [handbook’s] 
advice within is so obvious and condescending that it would really only 
be appropriate when attempting to advise an alien from outer space on 
how to act human.’

Salon.com has a similar outlook, and has labelled the etiquette guide as ‘unbelievably sexist’.

According
 to the Los Angeles Times, the Raiders are one of the few NFL teams that
 allows dating among cheerleaders and players. But they do strongly 
discourage it, even threatening in the guide: ‘Some teams who previously
 had cheerleaders do not now have them (Chicago Bears). Because of 
morality problems with their squads, they decided cheerleaders were too 
much trouble to deal with.’

'The handbook’s advice is so 
obvious and condescending that it would really only be appropriate when 
attempting to advise an alien from outer space'

It
 also includes lines like, ‘There’s not a female alive (or male either) 
who doesn’t like attention. But you need to learn to deal with attention
 you receive from the public (and especially the players) without it 
getting out of hand and going to your head.’

The
 handbook advises the cheerleaders to find out if players are married 
before becoming their friends, saying that many will 'lie' about their 
marital status and that it is the Raiderette's job to find out the 
truth.

Appearance is also one of the handbook's main topics.

Cheerleaders
 are told to always be ready to make a lasting first impression by 
maintaining their appearance – a stipulation that includes a perfect 
manicure.

Raiderettes are instructed to keep nail polish remover pads in their cars in case of emergency.

Aside
 from cheering at home games, Raiderettes are expected to make multiple 
personal appearances each season – some of which may involve eating an 
unsavory meal.

In these 
cases the squad is advised: ‘If you don’t like your meal, try a little 
of everything and strategically move the rest around your plate.’

War of wages: A rookie cheerleader known as 'Lacy T' has filed a suit against the team on her squad's behalf, claiming that its cheerleaders are paid less than $5 per hour

Outlines
 for Raiderette salaries are also included in the guide, requiring 
cheerleaders to sign a contract that, according to squad members, makes 
them accept a wage that does not meet government-regulated hourly 
minimums -  a payment that prompted a rookie Raiderette known as ‘Lacy 
T’ to file a lawsuit against the team’s  owners last week on the squad’s
 behalf.

'Just think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers and/or being assaulted'

According to 
the suit, Raiderettes are paid less than the government minimum. Dancers
 must attend practice three times per week, cheer at ten seasonal home 
games, conduct multiple personal appearances, and travel for special 
photo shoots.

They are only paid for their appearances at games, at $125 per match – adding up to a total of $1,250 in seasonal earnings.

When
 taking all of the unpaid practices, appearances, and additional time 
into account, Lacy T has estimated that she and her squad members are 
paid less than $5 an hour.

Her legal counsel has pointed out that it against the law to make dancers sign an already-illegal contract.

It is also unlawful to only pay the dancers at the end of the season, rather than in incremental amounts.

The Oakland Raiders will not provide comment on the lawsuit or the leak of its Raiderette handbook.
