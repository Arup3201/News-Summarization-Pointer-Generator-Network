Five years ago, Tony Bilau, 30, was too fat to skydive.

Determined to leap from a plane at all costs, he got a personal trainer, changed his diet and dropped 50lbs to go from french fries to flight.

Now a champion diver, the Nebraska resident's signature move is an homage to his former self -  putting his hands behind his head and extending his legs out in a reclining position, he pretends to be laid out on a couch - at 10,000 feet in the air.

Before: The weight limit on most skydiving equipment is 230lbs, meaning that at 260lbs, Mr Bilau had to make a considerable change

Mr Bilau told the Journal Star that before free-falling from planes, his preferred sport of choice was virtual: video games.

'Skydiving just got me out there,' Mr Bilau said. 'I never really left the house. This got me out there and living life, finally.'

The weight limit on most skydiving equipment is 230lbs, meaning that at 260lbs, Mr Bilau had to make a considerable change.

With a bit of professional help and a whole lot of will power, Mr Bilau dropped the weight and then some.

Champ: For his first dive, he even chose not to go tandem with an instructor, insisting that he would go it alone

For his first dive, he even chose not to go tandem with an instructor, insisting that he would go it alone.

'When that door opened the first time, so much goes through your mind, like, "What I’m I doing?"' Mr Bilau said.

'But I crawled out and did my jump and made it down fine. It was just instant addiction.'

Mr Bilau committed himself to the sport, going on to win medals in numerous competitions.

At just 190lbs, he now dives at least once a weekend.

This month he'll be competing in Nebraska's Cornhusker State Games, an amateur sports festival in late July.

He's
also been chosen to participate in the Torch Run, a 1,100 mile race 
that began June 6 and ends with the Games. Mr Bilau dedicated his lap to
a friend with cancer.
