The Duke and Duchess will attend a basketball game during a three-day visit to New York next month, Kensington Palace has revealed.

The sporty couple will take courtside seats at a game set to take place on the second day of their three-day visit which will take in both the Big Apple and Washington DC.

Both will be based in New York during the three-day trip, although Prince William will also spend part of the trip in Washington D.C where he will attend an anti-poaching conference. 

Heading to the Big Apple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit New York next month

First visit: Neither the Duke nor Duchess have ever visited New York or Washington D.C before

The Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, will spend the entire visit in New York and is to visit a child development centre and host a lunch at the British Consulate while her husband is away.

Contrary to earlier reports, Prince George won't be joining his parents on the trip and will remain in London with nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.

The visit is the couple's first to the US since 2011, when they travelled to Los Angeles, a few months after their wedding.

This time, their visit will be confined to the East Coast - completely new territory for both as neither have previously visited it before, in any capacity.

William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation.

The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games.

In addition to promoting the welfare of current and former members of the Armed Forces, the Foundation also works with young people and is committed to supporting conservation efforts.

Los Angeles: The couple's first US visit in 2011 was to California where they met Mayor Villaraigosa

Glamorous: They also hobnobbed with celebrities, among them singer and actress Jennifer Lopez

Not coming: The couple will travel to the US without Prince George who will remain in London

It is the latter that forms the basis for much of the schedule, with the Duke of Cambridge spending his first full day in the US at an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank in Washington D.C.

Once there, the Duke is expected to call for a zero tolerance approach to the trade in endangered animal parts on behalf of United For Wildlife, a conservation organisation of which he is president.

He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch a basketball game. 

The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation.

Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries.

Support: The couple attended the BAFTA Brits to Watch event during their 2011 visit to Los Angeles

On their way: The Duchess will spend the whole of the three-day visit in New York

Brits abroad: Anna Wintour and Piers Morgan are among the British media contingent working in the U.S

New York has long been a destination of choice for talented British journalists, among them Vogue's Anna Wintour and MailOnline Editor-at-Large (US), Piers Morgan, who lives in LA but spends much of his time in New York.

Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US.

The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same History of Art degree course.

Since leaving the University, the Duchess in particular has become a regular attendee of alumni events, the majority in London.

The New York event is along similar lines and will support scholarships and bursaries for students from underprivileged backgrounds, as well as new student sports facilities.
