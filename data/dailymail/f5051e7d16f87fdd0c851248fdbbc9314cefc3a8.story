New job: Monica Lewinsky is a new Vanity Fair columnist, according to a blog posted on the magazine's website on Thursday. The blog comes a month after she published a tell-all about her Clinton affair for the magazine

One month after writing a tell-all about her affair with Bill Clinton for Vanity Fair, Monica Lewinsky has been made a contributor at the magazine.

The magazine published her first Thursday afternoon, in which the 41-year-old talks about binge-watching Orange is the New Black.

While Lewinsky writes that she finds the show 'riveting', she admits she didn't find a joke about herself very funny.

In the the eleventh episode of the first season, one character is explaining to another how to perform a sex act and tells her she needs to 'Lewinsky that sh**'

After more than a decade, Lewinsky is still sensitive to the jokes. 

'I did what I usually do in these situations where the culture throws me a shard of my former self. After the cringing embarrassment, the whiff of shame, and the sense that I am no longer an agent running my own life, I shuddered, I got up off the sofa, and I turned it off,' Lewinsky wrote.

Lewinsky went on to write about how people at the center of scandals today have more control over the public conversation thanks to social media - a tool she didn't have in the 90s when news of the Clinton affair broke.

Lewinsky writes that people today who lose control of their 'public narratives' can go on social media and 'take control of their rightful place in their community.'

'They refuse to have their identities swindled or misshapen. Instead they take charge. They turn the attack on its head and use it as an opportunity for self-definition, instead of just taking blood as they go down,' Lewinsky writes, hinting that the column may be her own way of reclaiming her reputation.

MailOnline has reached out to the magazine for comment about whether Lewinsky's column will be regular, but has not yet received a response.
