Matty Fryatt bagged his first goal for league leaders Nottingham Forest as Stuart Pearce's men came from behind to stun Bournemouth 2-1.

Summer signing Fryatt rose highest to guide substitute Jack Hunt's cross past a diving Lee Camp after 72 minutes to complete an unlikely turnaround.

The Cherries, looking to make it three wins from three this season, dominated the game from the get go and took the lead after 58 minutes when new £3million striker Callum Wilson toe-poked home his third of the campaign.

Britt Assombalonga scored his third goal in two games after 67 minutes, heading in Andy Reid's cross, before Fryatt's decisive contribution.

Substitute Magaye Gueye struck an equaliser in the fifth minute of injury time as Millwall snatched a 1-1 draw at Sheffield Wednesday.

The winger fired his first Lions goal into the roof of Keiren Westwood's net with virtually the last kick of the game at Hillsborough, after Chris Maguire had put Wednesday ahead in the second half. 

Shaun Williams missed a second half penalty for Millwall.

Watford taught Rotherham a harsh lesson about life in the Championship after they staged a late show at New York Stadium to win 2-0.

Lloyd Dyer's first league goal for the club put them ahead in the 73rd minute and with the hosts pushing for a leveller Gianni Munari made sure of the points with five minutes to go.

Bradley Johnson scored his second spectacular goal in the space of four days as Norwich City recovered from a dreadful start to claim a hard-fought 3-1 victory against Blackburn Rovers at Carrow Road.

With 87 minutes on the clock and the game locked at 1-1 Johnson, who scored a cracker in Saturday's 3-0 win over Watford, curled a glorious left foot shot over Paul Robinson to put the Canaries ahead.

Lewis Grabban then scored his second of the night deep into injury-time to confirm City's second win of the season.

Grabban had equalised for the Canaries halfway through the first half after Tom Cairney's cracking drive gave Rovers the lead inside a minute.

Blackpool are rooted to the bottom of the division after losing 2-1 to Brentford at Bloomfield Road.

Nathan Delfouneso put the hosts ahead, but goals from Alex Pritchard and Stuart Dallas secured Brentford's first win of the season.

Elsewhere, Reading lost 2-1 at home to Huddersfield Town, with Jacob Butterfield and Harry Bunn netting.

Simon Cox netted the Royals' consolation 11 minutes from time.
