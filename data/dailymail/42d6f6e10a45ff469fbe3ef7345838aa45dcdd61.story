As thousands of young Australians look to buy their first home, it may be Generation Y that suffers the most as skyrocketing property prices preventing them from entering the market. 

A survey of real estate agents around the country revealed that 60% believe the Australian dream of owning your home is becoming less obtainable, and young Australians could be forced to rent long-term as residential property prices jumped an average of 6.8% in the last 12 months.

One Gen Y couple who have been struggling to purchase their first property are Katherine Ross, 29, and her partner Hauaru Gilbert, who have been looking seriously for the past twelve months to buy a house in Sydney.

The capital city saw a staggering price increase of 12.2% over the past twelve months, which Ms Ross said has been  the greatest barrier to buying their own home.

'The prices are really pushing us out of the market. The sellers market keeps going higher and even two bedroom apartments are a minimum of $700,000,' Ms Ross told Daily Mail Australia.

According to a nationwide survey, conducted by real estate agent ranking and reviews platform OpenAgent, 75% of real estate agents believe that property prices are going to continue to increase over the next twelve months.  

The strongest growth in property price for 2015 is expected on the East coast with New South Wales only slightly ahead of Queensland, then followed by Victoria. 

Ms Ross and her partner both work in Sydney's Eastern suburbs, and would ideally like to live close to their jobs but have been unable to find anything in their budget.

'We may have to look further out, which makes it very frustrating when discussing where we want to live,' she said.

Ms Paniaras said that she and her partner weren't taken seriously by estate agents when looking at properties

One of the elements of the process they found difficult was not having professional advice available to them

Sydney's Lord Mayor described the property market in Sydney as a 'housing crisis'.

'Many young people can no longer afford to buy into the housing market. There are people suffering housing stress,' Cr Moore said.

'For our future socio and economic prosperity we can no longer afford to shift the chronic housing issue to the too hard basket,' she said at Fixing Sydney's Housing Problems.

'The dream of owning your own home is still important for most Australians and we’re seeing that people are willing to forgo on the luxury of location to keep it alive,' said co-founder and co-CEO of OpenAgent, Zoe Pointon. 

Artemis Paniaras, a recruitment consultant and her fiancee William, a sales manager, are both in their mid-20s and faced different barriers when purchasing their first home.

'Real estate agents wouldn't take us seriously when we turned up to open house inspections,' Ms Paniaras said.

'They wouldn't talk to me or show any interest, even though we had enough for a deposit,' she said. 

Ms Paniaras and her fiancee were originally looking for a renovated property but soon realised that was out of their price range.

Ms Paniaras said that she knows of others who have been struggling to enter the market based on prices

'We ended up buying a property to renovate ourselves, and even then some of the properties were asking ridiculous sums,' Ms Paniaras said.

'My sister is in the property market at the moment and the first bid at auction is usually over her price limit, even though she's done her homework,' she said.

Both couples said that one of the elements of the process that they found difficult was not having any professional advice available to them when looking to buy a property.

'We want help from local agents to work out areas that are realistic for our budget,' said Ms Ross.

'That would be such a help and be a huge first step. We just aren't receiving any advice,' she said. 

Ms Pointon said that it is crucial for young Australians who are looking to buy a property that they look for an agent who is informed about the local area. 

'Whether you’re purchasing or selling a property, it’s likely to be the biggest financial transaction you will make over the course of your life,' Ms Pointon said.

'With the predicted increase in prices, people can’t afford to be making blind choices about finding an agent to navigate the market for them. What’s critical here is that both buyers and sellers ensure they are working with an agent who really gets the local market,' she said.

'Whether you’re a first home buyer, an investor or someone who just needs to sell quickly, you need to make sure you are working with an agent who understands your priorities and has experience in that space.'
