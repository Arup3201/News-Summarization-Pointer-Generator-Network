Adam Lallana looks sets to become the latest player to withdraw from the England squad after suffering a groin injury and is likely to miss the international fixtures against Lithuania and Italy.

The Liverpool star was replaced at half-time by Steve Gerrard - who then returned to the changing rooms just 38 seconds later - and his injury-hit season looks to continue with his latest problem.

Lallana is seen as a key player for England and his loss will be a major blow for Roy Hodgson ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

Fraser Forster and Luke Shaw had already withdrawn from the squad with Rob Green, Jack Butland and Danny Rose taking their place. 

It's unknown who Hodgson will call-up as a replacement or he may choose not if he feels his squad his strong enough to deal with Lallana's absence.

England will be looking to keep up their 100 percent record in their European Championships Qualifying group when they welcome Lithuania to Wembley on Friday, with Harry Kane in line to earn his first cap for his country.

The following game should be a more testing against Italy, who got the better of England at the World Cup, and Hodgson may use that game to blood some of his newer players.

England manager Roy Hodgson could bring in a replacement or may choose to stick with his current squad
