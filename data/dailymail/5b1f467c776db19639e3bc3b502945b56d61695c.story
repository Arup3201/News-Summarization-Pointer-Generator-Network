A self-confessed fizzy drink and crisp addict who was 'heading for a heart attack' has ditched the junk food to shed more than six stone in two years.

Rebecca Demaurie, from Rednal, Birmingham, was drinking four litres of bubbles a day - equivalent to a dozen cans - and would eat up to 24 bags of crisps, too.

But when the mother-of-four bought herself a full-length mirror and caught a glimpse of her 21st self, she was so horrified that she decided to join her local Slimming World club.

Rebecca joined her local Slimming World club and two years on, the 36-year-old mother-of-four has been named Greatest Loser 2015 at her Frankley group 

Two years on, the 36-year-old has been named Greatest Loser 2015 at her Frankley group after shedding 6st 3lbs.

Rebecca said: 'I was a heart attack waiting to happen.

'I could hardly walk down the road without getting out of breath, and I started suffering heart palpitations.

'I would go to bed and not know if I was going to wake up again. It affected me a lot, and I felt like I didn't want to leave the house.

'One day, I had been in the bath and I went upstairs to get changed. I caught myself in a new full-length mirror we had in the bedroom, and I really didn't like what I saw.'

Rebecca piled on weight gradually over the course of ten years as she snacked constantly on crisps, cakes, chocolate and fizzy drinks.

She would order takeaways three times a week, and cook pizzas and burgers, while also enjoying huge bowls of cereal.

'I would just fill my face with food,' said Rebecca, who had a Body Mass Index of 46.5 when she started her diet in February 2013.

'But straight afterwards I would feel bad and depressed again. I wasn't even enjoying the food any more.

The proud slimmer says: 'I can now actually run. It has been hard, but I feel so much better!'

'Going to that first Slimming World class, I was absolutely petrified. I felt so ashamed.'

Now, Rebecca has ditched the junk food and cooks all her meals from scratch for all the family - and husband Alan has lost weight, too.

'I'm so proud of my Slimming World certificates,' she said. 'They sit pride of place on my mantelpiece.

'I still have another three stone to go, but I feel like I don't embarrass my daughter anymore.

'I can actually run, and I eat so many vegetables that I think I'm going to turn into one. It has been hard, but I feel so much better!'
