Nurse Julie Shorter, 52, is suing East Surrey Hospital for £250,000 claiming she was left with 'psychological injuries' after her sister died

A nurse is suing the NHS claiming £250,000 for a 'broken heart' after she watched her pregnant sister die from a brain haemorrhage following a 'catalogue of errors' by hospital staff.

As a senior sister in a neurological care unit, Julie Shorter had witnessed the deaths of dozens of patients, watching their families' grief as part of her day-to-day job.

But the 52-year-old said it did not prepare her for the 'sledgehammer' emotional blow of witnessing her sister Lucia's death from a brain haemorrhage, aged 39.

Her lawyers said the tragedy came after a 'catalogue of errors' by staff at East Surrey Hospital in 2009.

Mrs Shorter is suing the NHS Trust which runs the hospital, for up to £250,000 citing the nervous shock and 'psychological injury', she suffered.

Her professional understanding of medical matters made the experience even more traumatic for her than for ordinary members of the public, the High Court heard. 

But the trust which runs the hospitals argues Mrs Shorter is not entitled to a penny, adding her expertise and experience should have 'prepared her for what she would encounter'.

Bosses said they have already admitted liability in relation to Ms Sharma's death and have paid her family two compensation claims since 2009.

Mrs Justice Swift was told that Lucia Sharma was pregnant with her third child when she was admitted to the hospital in May 2009.

Charlotte Jones, representing Mrs Shorter, said that the mother-of-two had been experiencing headaches, stiffness in her neck and nausea.

But a CT scan carried out on May 5 at the hospital was reported to her as showing 'no abnormality' in her brain.

A week later, however, as her symptoms worsened and she began to suffer fits, it was discovered that the scan in fact showed she had suffered a brain haemorrhage.

'The bleed had been missed,' Miss Jones told the court, adding that Lucia was 'reassured and discharged'.

She argued that that was just one of 'a catalogue of errors' in her treatment, which included delays in Lucia being transferred to a specialist brain unit.

Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she died after being transferred to St Georges Hospital, Tooting.

Her life support machine was turned off on May 13, before her sister's eyes, the court heard.

Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust has admitted liability in relation to the expectant mother's death and has already paid out on two compensation claims by her family.

However, the trust denies that Mrs Shorter is entitled to a penny, saying it could not reasonably have foreseen her powerful reaction to what she saw.

Mrs Shorter, of Burgess Hill, West Sussex - who works for the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust - told the judge that the shock of witnessing her sister's end, and in particular her deeper medical understanding of the situation, have left her emotionally scarred and suffering from flashbacks.

She said she 'became a mother figure' to her sister after the early death of their mother from leukemia and that the pair had been 'particularly close'.

She had been left 'heartbroken' by her loss, she added.

Describing the trauma of watching Lucia's condition worsen, she told the judge: 'My worst fears were being realised. I was absolutely terrified.

'I was very frightened, but I didn't want that to come across to Lucia - she was frightened enough.

'When you are an adult that's what you have to do. I didn't think it would help if I started crying along with her or freaking out.'

She told of her horror at seeing her sister put on to life support, saying that, as a senior nurse, she knew how grave the situation was.

'It hit me like a sledgehammer. I felt sick and horrified,' she told the court.

'For me, seeing someone lying there in that position is not the same as for someone who doesn't have the medical knowledge that I do of these patients.

'It hit me like a blow. I've seen lots of people being respirated in my time as a nurse, but I don't think anything ever prepares you for seeing a loved one on a respirator.

'We see lots of families and relatives who are losing their loved ones, and now I was that person.

'Nothing can prepare you for that. I was absolutely heartbroken.

'I remember feeling absolutely bereft, devastated and helpless. There was nothing I could do. I knew I'd lost her,' she said.

Miss Jones told the judge that, due to her emotional trauma, Mrs Shorter was plunged into a 'major depressive episode' and still experiences chest pains and flashbacks.

The High Court heard the trust which runs the hospitals argues Mrs Shorter is not entitled to a penny, adding her expertise and experience should have 'prepared her for what she would encounter'. Bosses said they have already admitted liability in relation to Ms Sharma's death and have paid her family  compensation

Whilst managing to hold down her job, she has to take time off regularly and her condition 'renders her employment status precarious', the barrister said.

The trust denies liability for Mrs Shorter's mental injuries, arguing that Lucia's death was a 'gradual drawn out process'.

It insists that what happened was not 'shocking or horrifying' enough to foreseeably trigger such an extreme response in her sister.

Mrs Shorter's professional training, the trust argues, 'prepared for what she would encounter' when she witnessed her sister's final hours.

Julian Matthews, for the Trust, confirmed outside court that it had admitted liability in the two previous claims in relation to Lucia's death.

The High Court hearing, set to last for three days, continues.
