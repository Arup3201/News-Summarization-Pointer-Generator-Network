More than 15 police cars and paddy wagons converged on Mountain Street, sirens blaring

At least 10 children were waiting to be picked up by parents from a preschool across the road at the time of the incident, witnesses say

This is the dramatic moment a suspected carjacker was chased down an alley, handcuffed and arrested during a police chase - all in full view of shocked witnesses.

The crime unfolded in broad daylight in Ultimo, an inner city suburb of Sydney, about 5.30pm.

Witnesses told how they watched the shirtless man being chased. When they caught up with police and suspect, he was lying face down in the street.

Witnesses say a policewoman threw the shirtless man to the ground. A young photographer who happened on the scene was told by police to back off

Photographer Michael Thrower, 19, happened to be taking pictures in the area 'for fun' when he saw police cars speed down an alley.

'I thought there was no reason they'd be going down into the alley unless the person they were chasing was there so I followed them,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'As I came around the corner I saw a policewoman throw her arm around the shirtless man and throw him to the ground.

'When i got closer, they were handcuffing him and the man was yelling at me to "take photos, take photos," so I did,' he said.

Witnesses say the man was running shirtless along Mountain Street when police 'tackled' him to the ground

Witnesses  overheard police say the man was arrested over a suspected carjacking in the area

Mr Thrower said the police told him to back off an put the camera away

Another photographer said as many as 15 police cars were involved in the chase, which started in George Street and the subsequent arrest.

A female witness who was waiting to pick up children from outside a childcare centre said it was 'pretty scary.'

'I saw a guy running across the road, shirtless and I knew that he was on the run,' she told the second photographer. 'Police just converged from every angle...on car and by foot.

The man was taken away in a paddy wagon. Witnesses say they overheard police say they were looking for at least one other person

'I stayed in my car. Once I saw police coming on foot with hands ready to go on their pistols, I thought I'd better stay inside my car.' The incident follows a string or violent carjackings across Sydney. 

Last month, a 56-year-old woman made a lucky escape when she was beaten over the head with a shovel in an attempted carjacking in Sydney's north-west.

Police were unable to give further details about the arrest when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.
