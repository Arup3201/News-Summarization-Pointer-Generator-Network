Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has written a get-well card to a three-year-old girl with leukaemia.

Bronson - dubbed Britain's most violent prisoner - has also donated a drawing to Francesca Allen after being told about her plight by a fan who wrote to him in jail.

Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap, sketched a card from his cell in HMP Wakefield with her name being held up by song birds.

Charles Bronson drew this get-well card from prison for Francesca Allen, who is battling leukaemia

Bronson, dubbed Britain's most violent prisoner, wrote to Francesca after being told of her illness by a pen pal

Under the picture Bronson wrote: 'Get Well Fast - We all Love Ya!'

He also donated a pencil drawing depicting a prisoner in Broadmoor wearing a one-man-band-style contraption labelled 'Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum.'

The 60-year-old career criminal has donated the picture which will be auctioned off to raise cash for Frankie’s Fund. His pictures regularly fetch up to £1,000 at auction.

Bronson wrote to Francesca, who is known as Frankie to her family, after he was told about her condition by pen pal Darren Holdcroft, who has written to Bronson for eight months.

Frankie's mother Karen Allen said: 'At first I was quite taken back by it. The picture he has drawn is really nice and it is very nice of him to be donating one for us to auction off too.

'He isn't the sort of man you would associate this kind of thing with, so I was shocked really, we all were.

'I just want to say thank you to him for taking the time to write to Frankie and to think about her, the money we may be able to raise for Frankie's Fund from his picture will be very helpful.

'When we do finally go home, I am hoping to write back to him to say thanks, but I don't know what to say, he's the last person I want to upset. My thoughts of him have changed dramatically since this.

Bronson also donated this drawing to Francesca's appeal fund and it could fetch up to £1,000

'Frankie has been rough recently, she's 
been put through it, there doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the 
tunnel at the minute.'

Frankie, who has two sisters, aged 14 
and 10, has been treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital since she was
diagnosed almost four weeks ago.

Mr Holdcroft, 34, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been writing to Bronson for eight months.

The father-of-two said: 'I know Frankie because she is my goddaughter’s best friend, so once I heard, I just wanted to do something to help.

'When
I told Charles about what was happening he was more than happy to help 
because he loves children and when he heard about her it just really 
tugged at his heartstrings.

'People hear that he is a criminal and automatically think he is a bad man, but he has done a lot of good things over the past 30 years. He is a reformed character.

'I am in constant contact with Frankie’s family. She has her good and bad days but everybody has come together to support her.

'We are just hoping that she can get through this.'

Bronson has a huge catalogue of convictions including armed robbery, wounding, grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment and blackmail.

He was first jailed in 1974 and has spent just 69 days out of prison.
