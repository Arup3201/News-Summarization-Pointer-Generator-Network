A 31-year-old woman has been arrested for posing as a teenager and having sex with a 14-year-old boy.

Naomi Dixon pretended she was a 17-year-old girl in order to have sex with the boy, according to police in Florida.

Dixon allegedly subtracted 14 years from her age when she met the boy at a party.

Deceived: Naomi Dixon pretended to be a teenager to have sex with a young boy

She and the 14-year-old had sex on the night they met and continued to meet up for sex at her home.

Police say the woman had sex with the boy about eight times.

The boy told investigators he would spend most of his time at Dixon's home in Deltona, Florida and that he tried to leave several times, but that she would get upset.

On one occasion he claimed she choked him and another time made cuts to her arms, including trying to carve his first initial.

Charged: Dixon is being held on $50,000 bail at Volusia County Branch Jail

The boy told his parents about the relationship because he was tired of Dixon trying to keep him at her home.

Dixon was questioned by police and told them she thought the boy was 18 years old.

She denied having sex with the teen, but later admitted to sleeping with him.

Dixon is being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail on $50,000 bail.

She is charged with two counts of lewd/lascivious battery involving a sex act on a person between 12 and 16 years of age, records show.
