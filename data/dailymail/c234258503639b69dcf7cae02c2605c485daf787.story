Police have launched a murder inquiry after the death of a two-year-old boy who was admitted to hospital with serious head injuries.

A 25-year-old woman, believed to be the boy's mother, and a 21-year-old man thought to be her partner were arrested on suspicion of killing the toddler.

The little boy, who has not been named had been originally admitted to the University Hospital Coventry on Monday with head injuries, and was later transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital for specialist treatment.

Investigation: Police were questioning a 25-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man over the death of a two-year-old boy who died after he was admitted to University Hospital in Coventry with serious head injuries

West Midlands Police said a 21-year-old man and a woman, 25, were being held on suspicion of murder following the boy's death.

Police were alerted by hospital staff and the man, who is not the boy’s biological father, was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday morning on suspicion of assault.

The boy’s mother was also arrested on suspicion of assault.

At around noon on Tuesday the young boy was pronounced dead at hospital and the couple were re-arrested on suspicion of murder.

A
forensic post-mortem examination, which took place yesterday afternoon,
was inconclusive and further tests are required to establish a cause of
death.

The man and woman, who lived in the same street in Coventry, both remained in custody today.

Police have cordoned off a house on the 
road while forensic experts conducted a finger-tip search of the 
property.

Neighbours said that they had telephoned social services to 
raise concerns about the little boy, who was believed to have lived at 
the house with his mother.

However, Coventry City Council said they had no involvement with the child.

The woman’s next door neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said they
had logged a complaint with social services after hearing arguments 
through the walls.

He said: ‘There were quite a lot of loud rows, sometimes late at night.

‘It can’t have been a good environment for the little boy.

‘We rarely saw him though, she didn’t really speak to any neighbours.

‘We didn’t even know his name.’

Another neighbour added that he had seen a string of different men entering the property.

He said: ‘I think she had five or six different blokes on the go, you’d see a different man in that house every day.

‘Once she locked herself out of the house when the little boy was still inside.

‘I know the neighbours phoned up social services but I don’t know if they did anything about it.'

Neighbour Oche Agbo, 23, said he had witnessed a disturbance in the street on Monday night, just hours before the boy was taken to hospital.

He said: ‘I saw a man storming up and down the street in front of the house at about 11pm.

‘He was raging, really screaming and shouting about something.

‘He was clearly upset about something.

The little boy, who has not been named, had been initially admitted to the University Hospital Coventry on Monday with head injuries

The boy was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital for specialist care but later died

‘I didn’t get a good look at him but he seemed like he was a young guy.'

A single police officer stood guard outside the house yesterday while police carried out searches.

A mum-of-three, who was too distressed to speak, left a teddy bear at 
the scene with a note attached which read: ‘RIP little one, another 
angel gone to spread there (sic) wings. xxx’

A Coventry City Council spokesman said: “We can confirm that the child was not known to us.

‘We were extremely sad to hear the news of this tragic death.

‘As a murder enquiry is now underway and an investigation is ongoing we 
are unable to comment further, although we will, of course, co-operate 
fully with West Midlands Police if necessary during their 
investigation.’
