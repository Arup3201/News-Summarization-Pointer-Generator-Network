No sooner had Amir Khan boxed his brilliant way into pole position to fight Floyd Mayweather than the clamour for a re-match between the Money man and Marcos Maidana rose up to threaten that prospect.

Khan staked his claim to the key to the Mayweather treasure chest with the dazzling welterweight debut in which he crushed Luis Collazo.

Before the watching world had time to savour the moment, Maidana followed him into the same ring on the Las Vegas Strip and engaged Mayweather in a brawl so thrilling that not even the world’s No 1 boxer can wait for second helpings.

Take a bow: Amir Khan won his welterweight debut against Luis Collazo in Las Vegas

‘Let’s do it again right here,’ he snapped at Maidana as the Argentinian kept insisting that he was the real winner of their close encounter of the brutal kind.

September is the proposed date for that spiteful reunion and that is a problem for Khan.

The fasting to which Bolton’s most celebrated Muslim must submit during Ramadan concludes at the end of July. As he reiterated here: ‘That doesn’t give me time to train properly for a fight of the Mayweather magnitude.’

Before this star-spangled fight night at the MGM Grand Garden preliminary talks were under way in an effort to persuade Mayweather to put back his next fight from his traditional September date, until November.

But commercial considerations come first for the man who is banking $32 million and rising for his Saturday night’s work and a re-match with Maidana is now big box office.

‘If this is the fight the fans want then let’s do it in September,’ he said. It appears they do.

Going the distance: Khan won by a unanimous decision as he hoped to set up a bout with Floyd Mayweather

Although the anti-Mayweather crowd jammed into the arena failed to recognise the heart and the talent with which he had brought him through a serious test and booed the majority decision in his favour, those jeers turned to cheers when he offered Maidana another shot.

Khan’s best chance appears to be coming back to Mayweather’s home town next May, although he and his advisors will continue to pursue negotiations as Showtime TV executives compute the pay-per-view returns and whether Maidana can help improve those numbers in a return bout.

In terms of how much pressure he can apply with his fists, Khan could hardly have done more as he stepped up to the 147 lbs division for the first time in his career.         

Collazo, who once gave Ricky Hatton all the trouble he could handle, was resurgent and aiming for a million-making fight of his own with Mayweather.

Yet even though he is the naturally larger welterweight he was knocked down three times by Khan on his way to overwhelming points defeat.

After the first decking, from a wonderfully short but precise right in the fourth, Collazo resorted to the desperate measure of fighting with his hands down in hope of luring Khan and his allegedly suspect chin onto a sucker punch.

It never happened. Khan had spent a year out of the ring waiting for Mayweather before he was shunted onto Saturday’s under-card but he spent the time learning to defend himself.

Virgil Hunter, his latest trainer, also impressed upon Khan the advisability of balancing his speed and skill with an element of self-protection while waiting patiently for the openings for his lightning attacks to present themselves.

Below the belt: Collazo is warned by the referee after delivering a low blow that left Khan on the canvas

It worked perfectly against another former world champion. Khan won round after round and Collazo became so frustrated that he stooped to throwing deliberate low blows. 

To an extent that dubious tactic worked in the eighth, even though he was docked a point by referee Vic Drakulich. So incensed was Khan that he was similarly punished for a foul of his own - and so winded that Collazo won his only round.

But two rounds later Khan put him down twice more and the New Yorker of Puerto Rican antecedents was then held up by the ropes and saved by the bell.

Then, knowing the fight was lost, Collazo hit disgracefully low in the 12th. Astonishingly the referee did not deduct a point for that grievous offence and even tried to hurry Khan back into action.

Khan had to buy himself adequate recovery time by dropping to one knee. When he rose, he punished Collazo through to the final bell.

Khan has always maintained that his speed can over-run anyone, Mayweather included, and many previous non-believers are likely to have been converted by the job he did on Collazo. Still, on the question of fighting Khan, Mayweather kept his counsel, as usual.

He also kept the unbeaten record he cherishes so much and is 46-0 after unifying Maidana’s WBA world welterweight title with his WBC belt.

Mayweather did that despite Maidana hitting him 221 times, the most he has endured since computer punch statistics were introduced. A shuddering majority of those came during Maidana’s cavalry charge through the opening rounds…..from that fabled, knock-out right hand.

With Maidana turning it into a street fight, Mayweather was cut beside the right eye by a head butt in the fourth. He praised his corner for a repair job which left him untroubled by any blood flow thereafter.

Maidana, having won the first, took the fifth also and was level at that point.

Thereafter Mayweather’s consummate defending and clever, clinical, precise counter-punching gave him control of the crucial middle rounds. There was no robbery here, although how one judge scored it a draw is a mystery.

Maidana was warned for hitting low and Mayweather told him: ‘If we do this re-match please remember that I want to have more children.’

The Argentinian responded by accusing the American of ‘not fighting like a man they way I expected, not bringing the fight to me’

But no boxer is under any obligation to fight the way that would suit his opponent and from this neutral corner there could be no denying that Mayweather’s courage and cleverness deserved to give him the victory.

Whether he was strictly telling the truth when he claimed he had risked taking more punches ‘to please the fans’ is more debatable.

Khan senses that the great man is slowing down a little, at 37, and now might be a good time to fight him. By that reckoning this time next year could be an even better time.
