Detectives don't know for certain what led a father to kill his wife and two teenage children before burning down their $1.6million  mansion and committing suicide last May, but they did find evidence of mounting tension in the weeks leading up to the tragic incident.

The bodies of the four members of the Campbell family were discovered six months ago in the Avila, Florida home they were renting from retired tennis professional James Blake.

Investigators determined that Darrin Campbell was the family member to carry out the horrifying murders of his wife Kimberly, 51, and their children Collin, 18, and Megan, 16, before setting fire to the house and killing himself.

Why? Darrin Campbell (left) shot dead his wife Kimberly (right) and their teenage children Collin and Megan last May before burning down their $1.6million mansion and committing suicide. Hillsborough County, Florida sheriff's detectives finished their investigation into the murders and suicide but have found for no motive for the attack

Strict dad: A report published Wednesday does show some signs of tension in the Campbell household. Campbell was allegedly disappointed when his 18-year-old son Collin (left) did not get a scholarship to a Division I college for baseball. And daughter Megan (right), 16, started showing bruises on her body in the weeks leading up to her death, friends told investigators

What they don't know is why. In a report published Wednesday, marking an end to the investigation, detectives wrote that they have no motive for the crime.

'I don’t know if we will ever know exactly why everything happened the way it did,' sheriff’s spokeswoman Debbie Carter told the Tampa Bay Tribune.

However, the report did reveal several seemingly small issues that could have mounted to something more, inspiring Campbell to commit the shocking annihilation of his family. Those issues include some financial stress, trouble at Campbell's work and in his marriage as well as reports of strict parenting concerning son Collin's baseball prospects and new bruises appearing on daughter Megan's body.

Remains: Investigators say the family had some debts but appeared to be financially solvent for the most part. They were up to date with rent on the $1.6million mansion they rented from former tennis professional James Blake. A picture of the home after the incident last May, above

Investigators say that the Campbell family had some outstanding debt, which mounted at the beginning of the year, but it appeared the family's finances were mostly solvent, since they were up to date with rent and maintained a $4,000 average balance in their checking account. 

'It is obvious that some financial distress occurred after the first of the year,' the report reads. 'Those balances that would normally be paid off, were not and then carried forward after January 2014. Also, bills that were paid by Kimberly began being partially paid by Darrin or not paid at all.'

Kimberly's friends said she seemed to have no trouble spending money on a nice hotel in Nashville, Tennessee the weekend before her murder, at which point she also shelled out for a pair of $250 shoes. 

However, there did seem to be troubles in her marriage. 

Blaze: The week before her murder, Kimberly went on a girl's trip with her friends scheduled the weekend of her anniversary. She allegedly told her friends that she and her husband 'don't talk much anymore'

Stocking up: It appears Campbell planned the murders and his suicide. He purchased the gun used in the attack, and cans of oil and fireworks to burn down the house in the weeks leading up to May 7

'Kim said it was their anniversary, but that her and Darren don’t talk much anymore.' friend Amy Jordan told investigators.

An investigator concluded in the report though that they 'did not get the feeling that there was anything going wrong in the relationship between Darrin and Kim.'

Landlord: Above, former American tennis professional James Blake. Blake owned the house where the Campbells were living at the time of the murders 

While Campbell was described as a caring and involved father, his children allegedly told friends about his strict and controlling behavior. 

Collin's high school baseball coach says Campbell had unrealistic expectations about his son's college prospects, and that he became upset when the average player only got an offer to play at a Division II college, instead of a larger Division I school.  

In the weeks leading up to the attacks, daughter Megan's friends began noticing fresh bruises on her body which the 16-year-old attributed to dance injuries. 

Friends say though that Megan had been dancing for years and they had never noticed the injuries before.

The night of her death, Megan was supposed to spend the night at a friend's house, but she cancelled at the last minute saying her dad was making her stay at home for 'family time' - something he had allegedly never done before. 

And it appears Campbell planned the murders some time in advance. He purchased a .40 caliber handgun, fireworks and oil in the weeks before the shooting and just two days before asked for a leave of absence from his work where he was the chief operating officer of a digital services company.

That request led one employee to text Campbell to ask if he was ok. 

Campbell responded to that message two days later with a 'no' sent at 3:25am the morning of the murders. Just a few hours later, firefighters responded to reports of a  fire at the home.
