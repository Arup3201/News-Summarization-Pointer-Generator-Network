A police officer investigating a hit-and-run was shot dead by a gunman who then murdered an innocent motorist in an attempted car-jacking.

A police manhunt led them to suspect Darrell Fuller, 33, who had bullet wounds to his neck and shoulder when officers found him. They are believed to have been self-inflicted.

He was arrested over Tuesday morning's double murder and taken to Jamaica Hospital under police guard.

Suspect and victim: Darrell Fuller, left, was arrested for allegedly shooting to death 29-year-old officer Arthur Lopez, right, during a traffic stop, and then gunning down a motorist during a carjacking 

Fuller allegedly shot Lopez, 29, during a traffic stop after fleeing a hit-and-run accident, NBC4 reported.

Lopez ‘lost his life to a cold-blooded killer,’ Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said at a news conference.

The death came less than a week after another Nassau County officer was killed while responding to a traffic accident.

Lopez was on patrol in Bellerose Terrace, a community at the border of New York City's Queens borough and Nassau County. The officer and his partner spotted a damaged silver Honda that was ‘running on rims’ and fit the description of a car that had left a hit-and-run, authorities said.

The officers gave chase, and the car pulled over. Following a brief conversation between Lopez and the driver, the man got out of the vehicle and fired one round into Lopez's chest, Police Chief Steven Skrynecki said.

The officer was not wearing a bulletproof vest at the time. His partner was not injured.

Lopez was rushed to North Shore-LIJ Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Manhunt ends: Fuller was found outside a parked car in Queens with a gunshot wound to the shoulder

The gunman got back into his car and drove away, and then accosted the second victim, identified by CBS New York as 52-year-old Raymond Facey, of Brooklyn, authorities said. He shot the man in the head, dragged him out of his car and left him dead on the roadway as he drove away, they said.

According to DNAInfo.com, Facey, a father of four, pulled over on the Cross Island Expressway and was on the phone with his daughter Dahlia, discussing plans to go on a vacation to Jamaica, when he was gunned down.

His car was later found abandoned in a residential neighborhood in Queens.

The slayings touched off a massive manhunt that included heavily armed New York Police Department officers going door-to-door in Queens. Authorities also closed the Cross Island Parkway for several hours, causing traffic delays.

A man who witnessed the officer's shooting as he was stopped at a gas station along the highway said it looked like a routine traffic stop.

Criminal past: Fuller was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to an attempted murder charge stemming from a 2004 incident

‘The officer's walking up to the car. They just pulled out (a gun) and shot,’ said Paul Walcott, a music producer from the Queens neighborhood of Bayside. ‘He went right down. He got hit point blank. He went straight down.’

The car then sped off, heading south on the Cross Island Parkway, a north-south highway along the border of Queens and Nassau County.

‘In broad daylight, this time of day, it was incredible to see something like that,’ Walcott said.

The shooting unfolded within blocks of Belmont Park, the racetrack where the Belmont Stakes is held.

Highway patrolman Joseph Olivieri was killed Thursday while responding to a traffic accident caused by an alleged drunken driver.

The driver, who was later charged with driving while intoxicated, smashed into one car, then drove on a short distance before stopping. A car then hit that driver's vehicle, turning it sideways in the road.

The police officer who arrived to investigate was then struck by an SUV that happened upon the crash scene.

Thousands of police officers attended a funeral Monday for Olivieri outside a Long Island church.

Lopez joined the police force in 2004 and was also a volunteer firefighter and an EMT. He is survived by his father, mother and sister.

Fallen colleague: Officers investigate the murder of fellow policeman Arthur Lopez

Nassau County PBA President James Carter described him as ‘full of life, full of energy, a great cop and a great friend.’

Fuller has two prior arrests, including one in October 2004 for attempted murder and another in March 2010 for possession of cocaine, according to law enforcement sources.

He was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to the attempted murder charge and is currently on parole, sources said.

Originally from Queens, Lopez move to a one-story ranch-style home in Babylon four years ago.

Neighbors told the New York Post they are devastated by Lopez's tragic death. Many have described him as a friendly and nice guy who loved going to the gym and had recently bought a boat he called the Saltshaker.
