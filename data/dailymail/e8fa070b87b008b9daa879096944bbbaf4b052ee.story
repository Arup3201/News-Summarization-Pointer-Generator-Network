They arrived on a private jet but Catalan Dragons finally ran out of fuel, their dream play-off run ended by a St Helens side who showed their class to reach a sixth Grand Final in eight seasons.

The French visitors notched 6,000 air miles and unlikely wins over Leeds Rhinos and Huddersfield in their play-off campaign.

They would have dearly loved another trip across from Perpignan to attend next Saturday’s Grand Final for the first time. But Saints, who have not won the end-of-season prize since 2006, ran out comfortable winners with important tries either side of the interval.

‘We’re at the big dance now and the boys deserve it,’ said St Helens assistant coach Keiron Cunningham. 

Saints overcame adversity to clinch the League Leaders’ Shield following season-ending injuries to Luke Walsh, Jonny Lomax and Jon Wilkin.

‘There’s 1,000 excuses for why we shouldn’t be here,’ said Cunningham. ‘We lost our three best players but we didn’t give up, we fought on and that’s the proudest thing for me.’

They face the winners of Friday night’s semi-final between Warrington and Wigan. Tournament organisers will no doubt be relieved, realising that even as sweet a story as Catalan’s run here will not fill Old Trafford like an all-Lancashire final. 

Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous said he was ‘very proud’ of his team, who were without their star player Morgan Escare, who hobbled off the field five minutes after the interval.

Escare had controversially put the visitors ahead, skipping over the line after an acrobatic but suspect off-load from Thomas Bosc. The home fans booed as Bosc made the conversion.

Two minutes later Jordan Turner bulldozed his way over and Mark Percival kicked the first of five conversions. 

Adam Swift gave Saints the lead just before the interval. He burst down the wing and was inches from being bundled out, but somehow grounded the ball legally.

The decisive try came 10 minutes after the break. Paul Wellens and Tommy Makinson combined to release Willie Manu. 

The 20st 7lb prop Mose Masoe plunged the dagger further into Catalan hearts as he shrugged off a couple of slightly less burly men to dive under the posts. Percival rounded off the scoring 15 minutes from time.
