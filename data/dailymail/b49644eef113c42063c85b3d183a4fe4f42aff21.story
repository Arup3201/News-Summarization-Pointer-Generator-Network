The boyfriend of a Pennsylvania college freshman is facing a homicide charge after her lifeless body was found inside a campus dormitory.

Authorities said Monday they added the charge of criminal homicide against 19-year-old Gregorio Orrostieta after an autopsy showed signs that Millersville University student Karlie Hall, 18, had suffered multiple injuries from a beating and had been strangled.

Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman says Orrostieta didn't mention anything about strangulation when he told police he shoved Hall and hit her with the back of his hand.

Orrostieta told police that he and Hall got into an argument at a party Saturday night but that they amde up by the time they returned to her dorm room around 1:30am.

However, they started arguing again around 2am and the altercation turned violent.

Residents in the dorm overheard the couple arguing around that time but when an RA went to knock on Hall's door no one answered.

Police believe Hall died then, but it wasn't until 5am that her boyfriend called 911 asking for paramedics.

When emergency responders arrived on the scene, they found Orrostieta performing CPR on his unresponsive girlfriend, with blood smeared on his face and dried in some areas.

His shirt was also ripped, with scratch marks on his chest with more blood on his hands and jeans.

Hall was allegedly 'severely beaten' according to anonymous sources quoted by Lancaster Online.  

Orrostieta told police that he shoved Hall in teh course of their fight, which caused her to fall and hit her head on a chair. He then hit her with the back of the hand and that's when he said she passed out.

The teen was initially charged with just aggravated assault, but those charges were increased to include homicide when an autopsy performed Monday showed Hall suffered stangulation.

"He's responsible and we're going to hold him accountable," Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman told reporters at a news conference on Monday.

Orrostieta and Hall had allegedly been dating for 11 months.

Dorm residents said the two also got into a fight last fall where authoritites were called.

'I knew that the relationship wasn't that great,' Hall's friend, Trisha Faust, 19, said. 'It was on-again, off-again.'

Hall was a freshman from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Orrostieta, of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, did not attend the Lancaster County university. The university is about an hour drive from Orrostieta's home. 

He appears to have been visiting Hall for the weekend, according to a picture she posted to Facebook just one day before her death. In the picture, the couple appear happy as they lean in for a kiss, Hall wearing a Millersville University t-shirt. 

Orrostieta is being held at the Lancaster County Prison after being unable to post $1.5million bail.

In his mug shot, blood is visible on Orrostieta's brow.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for February 19.

Officials said university counseling staff will be available on campus to talk to students who need assistance.
