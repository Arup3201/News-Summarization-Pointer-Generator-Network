Worry: The number of young women dying from prescription drug overdoses has risen steeply

Prescription painkillers led to more than 92,000 overdose patients being treated at hospital last year - placing a huge burden on the nation's economy.

Overdoses involving prescribed painkillers have become a leading cause of death in the U.S. - astonishingly overtaking traffic and firearm accidents.

The figures, a shocking depiction of the the country's relationship with the drugs, were analysed in a report published online in JAMA Internal Medicine on Monday.

Researchers from Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University and Rush Medical College analyzed data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample from 2010.

Their work found that prescription painkillers, known as opioids, were causing a 'substantial' strain on the country's hospitals, the Baltimore Sun reports. 

They concluded: 'Further efforts to stem the prescription opioid overdose epidemic are urgently needed.'

Opioid drugs - which include forms of morphine, methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone, such as OxyContin and Vicodin - are prescribed for patients in need of powerful painkillers. 

But if people take them over an extended period of time, they will often develop a tolerance to the drugs and require a higher dose to feel any affect.

This makes an overdose more likely as those with too much opioid in their system can lose consciousness and stop breathing.

1. U.S.A. - 6.10%

2. Australia - 3.40%

3. Afghanistan - 2.92%

4. Pakistan - 2.40%

5. Seychelles - 2.30%

6. Russia - 2.29%

7. Iran - 2.27%

8. United Kingdom - 1.71%

9. Estonia - 1.53%

10. Azerbaijan - 1.50% 

It was estimated that hospital care for overdose victims cost around $1.4 billion in 2010 with painkiller deaths quadrupling between 1999 and 2011.

In 2009, overdoses involving painkillers actually overtook traffic accidents as a cause of death, and  in 2011 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the issue an epidemic.

In September, Dr Gary Franklin of the American Academy of Neurology, writing in the journal Neurology, said: ‘There have been more deaths from prescription opioids in the most vulnerable young to middle-aged groups than from firearms and car accidents. 

'Doctors, states, institutions and patients need to work together to stop this epidemic.

‘More than 100,000 people have died from prescription opioid use since policies changed in the late 1990s to allow much more liberal long-term use.’ 

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. recently unveiled a Justice Department 'tool kit' to guide law enforcement agencies responding to drug overdose alerts.

Danger: The danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive, say experts

He is encouraging police departments to provide officers with naloxone - a fast-working antidote that can reverse overdoses and prevent death.

He said: 'It's absolutely critical that we equip them to respond appropriately.' 

In 2012, a Los Angeles Times study showed that physicians play a worrying role - their prescriptions contributing to nearly half of all overdose deaths.

In response to the epidemic, almost every state has now created a prescription drug monitoring program - so physicians can log into a computer to check whether a patient is getting a dangerous narcotic from another doctor. 

Blame: A study has shown how physicians played an important role in the amount of prescription drug overdoses - contributing to nearly half of all deaths 

In July, America's painkiller epidemic was laid bare in its most stark terms to date as a UN report revealed that U.S. citizens abuse more pills than any other country in the world.

The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults, aged between 15 and 64, abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and oxycontin, in 2012.

Shockingly, that figure is twice as high as the world's second-worst offender, Australia, where opioid addicts comprise 3.1 per cent of citizens. 

The report read: 'In the United States, past-year illicit drug use by persons aged 12 years or older reached the highest level in the past 10 years.

'The number of deaths resulting from prescription painkiller overdose also continues to rise, especially among women.'

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body.

It's authors write: 'At the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful rewarding effect [that triggers] a cascade of intense pleasurable responses related to the brain dopamine release.

'Users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth, pleasure and sedation.

'Once regular use is established, vulnerable individuals develop an uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of opioid dependence, seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any negative consequence.'
