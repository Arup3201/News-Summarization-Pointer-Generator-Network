This video shows the shocking moment an Uber driver threw a man to the ground 'in self-defence' during a brawl on the streets of central London.

The taxi driver, wearing a black coat and white cap, can be seen grappling with a man next to his white car, with the driver door wide open.

As the man wearing a beige jacket, who is believed to be a member of the public, throws punches at the cabbie, the driver suddenly picks him up and slams him to the ground.

Apparently in 'self-defence', the driver picks up the man and throws him to the ground on Shaftesbury Avenue

As onlookers shout out of shot, the man gets to his feet and dusts himself off before kicking the driver in the shin.

At this point people intervene to stop the brawl, which happened on Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho, central London, on Wednesday evening.

The driver, who works for Uber, claims he was on his way to a job when the man pulled open the driver-side door as he was waiting to allow pedestrians across the road.

A spokesman for Uber, which allows people to book cabs using a mobile app, said the driver did not have a passenger in his car at the time.

She said: 'The driver was not on a job - he was heading to go to collect someone.

'He was stopped waiting for pedestrians [to cross in front of him] and while he was stopped someone ripped open the car door - so he was defending himself.

'We’re shocked to hear that an Uber partner driver was attacked in Soho. We are offering our full support to the driver who has gone to the police to report the incident. Thankfully the driver in question, whilst shaken up, is unharmed.'

The scuffle happened near Shaftesbury Avenue, known for its theatres, on Monday evening

The video was taken by black cab driver Hassan Mostafa, who was dropping off a passenger nearby at the time.

He said: 'I looked and saw the Uber car and a man shouting. I knew something was happening,

'I started recording and the man came out of the car. Then he and a guy started fighting.

'At that point I had to drive off and later I saw police at the scene.' 

The Uber driver was called into the firm's London offices on Thursday morning and later went to report the incident to the police.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they were aware of the video and that officers spoke to two men in the Shaftesbury Avenue area on Monday night. No arrests have been made.
