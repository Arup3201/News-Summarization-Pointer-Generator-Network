Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara has taken a swipe at Ronny Deila after Gary Mackay-Steven signed a pre-contract with Celtic.

The 24-year-old has agreed to switch to Parkhead in the summer, but the champions – who are also continuing their pursuit of Tannadice midfielder Stuart Armstrong – are set to try to strike a deal to accelerate the move.

United are thought to be seeking a £250,000 fee to let Mackay-Steven go in the current transfer window. Deila admitted this week that landing the winger this month would be his preference - and that aspect of the pursuit has upset McNamara.

‘I’m not comfortable with it,’ he said. ‘I like to speak about players behind the scenes and I don’t think it’s right to speak publicly about it. He (Deila) has his own way of doing things but I wouldn’t want to speak about one of his players under contract.

‘Gary is our player, he’s an important player and we have a lot of important games coming up starting with this next one against Inverness.

‘So would I go out and speak about another player under contract and say I want to take him just now? No.

‘I’ll speak to Gaz to make sure he focuses. He is our player, not anybody else’s, until the summer when his contract ends.

‘Gary has made it clear from pre-season he’s happy to stay on to the end of his contract. So, for me, there is no difference at this moment. Despite all the speculation - despite other managers saying they want to take him now - that doesn’t come into it for me.’

Dundee United are just a point behind Celtic in the Scottish Premiership and believe they can win silverware

McNamara believes Mackay-Steven remains determined to sign off his stint at United on a high. The Tannadice side currently sit third in the Premiership and remain in both the League Cup and Scottish Cup.

‘From pre-season, he’s said he wants to win a trophy with United,’ added former Celtic captain McNamara. ‘It will possibly help him to have his future settled rather than the uncertainty of running down his contract.

‘He’s a good sensible boy and hopefully now he can just get on with playing for us for the rest of the season. The club was always prepared for him leaving for nothing in the summer because it’s worth every penny of that financial hit to keep him here until the end of the season.

‘Obviously the fans will find out he’s going and he has to accept certain things may come with that. But he’s been a great servant to us so we’re hopeful that, after he goes at the end of the season, he’ll go on and be successful in his career.’

Celtic full-back Adam Matthews will welcome Mackay-Steven to the club after admitting he’s been one of his toughest Premiership opponents.

‘I’ve always had a difficult game when I’ve played against him,’ he said. ‘I’d put him up there with the best in Scotland. He’s got pace, a trick, good delivery and scores goals.’

The Welsh international has also been the subject of transfer debate, with Cardiff rumoured to be keen on taking him home - potentially in a trade for South Korean midfielder Kim Bo-kyung.

Finally free of injury issues that have scarred the last two seasons, however, Matthews insists his commitment to Celtic has not diminished over a three-and-a-half-year stay and there is now a sense of making up for lost time.

‘Do I see my future here? Yeah, definitely,’ he said. ‘I’ve enjoyed it since I first walked in the door. I’m very happy, I love the city and the fans have been brilliant with me.

‘I’ve heard nothing from my agent about clubs interested in me, it’s just talk. I’m 100-per-cent focused on Celtic. I’ve seen the stuff about Cardiff and I think nothing of it.

‘It’s been a difficult 18 months, but I feel fit and it’s the best I’ve felt since I picked up my injury against Juventus. Now I want to get a good second half of the season.’

Celtic are also interested in signing Dundee United's Stuart Armstrong 

Celtic returned from the sunshine of their training camp in Gran Canaria to the snow of Lennoxtown and face a four-point deficit to Aberdeen, albeit with two games in hand, ahead of today’s trip to Hamilton. Matthews is confident they will respond to the challenge.

‘We’ve looked switched on in training since getting home. The Dons are ahead, so the pressure is on us to win the matches we have in hand. We’re second in the table but if we win our games, we go top again. That’s a pressure but it’s one we like.’

Accies recorded a historic 1-0 win at Parkhead to briefly top the Premiership in early October, but Matthews senses revenge today.

‘We missed a stackload of chances,’ he insisted. ‘Hopefully, we can put that right with a win and get back into the swing of things in the league.’
