Pledging to take the train seemed to be causing quite a strain for Simon Burns yesterday.

The Transport Minister looked nonplussed as he waited on the platform for the 5.58am, then almost bemused as he queued to board it.

Things only got worse when he found his 2nd class carriage was full and he was forced to stand in the corridor for the 36 minute journey from Chelmsford to Liverpool Street, London.

But at least he did not have any of those troublesome red boxes to worry about.

All he had with him was a newspaper and a book which he buried his nose in to pass the time on the journey, for which the cheapest single ticket costs £14.20.

It was the third day running this week Mr Burns has gone to work by train after being railroaded into not using his chauffeur-driven car.

There was an outcry after a Sunday newspaper reported it cost the taxpayer £80,000 a year.

Mr Burns, a Tory Minister of State with responsibility for ‘rail strategy’ and ‘fares policy’, denied his journeys into London from his home cost that figure.

Mr Burns appeared to feel the cold as he stepped out at Liverpool Street Station

He uses a Department for Transport 
pool car, he said, which, because of ‘flat rate’ charges which apply 
regardless how many journeys are made, would cost £80,000 even if he did
 not make the 35-mile commute in it.

But after mounting pressure from 
commuters and fellow politicians, he decided to ‘adjust’ his working 
practices and how he travels to and from work.

‘My previous arrangements were not intended as a snub to hard-pressed rail travellers,’ he added.

Mr
 Burns claimed he took the car from his Chelmsford home only because he 
was barred from working on his Red Box of official Ministerial papers on
 the train for security reasons, the Mail on Sunday reported.

But he was contradicted by the Cabinet
 Office, which said Ministers could work on papers in public as long as 
they ensured sensitive material could not be seen.

So where were Mr Burns’ Red Boxes were when he caught the train yesterday?

His
 spokesman said: ‘He has changed his habits more broadly than just how 
he travels. He is working later in the office so not having to travel 
with the boxes.’ The spokesman added that the boxes were not transported
 by another means but stayed in the office instead.

It
 was unclear if Mr Burns has bought a season ticket, but his spokesman 
insisted the change to his travel habits was ‘not just this week, but 
on-going’.
