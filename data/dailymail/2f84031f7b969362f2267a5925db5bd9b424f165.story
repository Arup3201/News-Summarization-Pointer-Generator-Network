A Republican politician has been charged with the 1979 murder of his 23-year-old lover - who he is accused of choking to death in her bed.

Pennsylvania builder Gregory Scott Hopkins, 65, was arrested on Sunday after cold-case investigators linked his DNA to the killing of Catherine Janet Walsh, of Monaca.

She was found by her father in her bed, bound and strangled with a bandana, on September 1, 1979, after he could not contact her over Labor Day weekend.

Beaver County prosecutors said police had found new DNA evidence on Walsh's nightgown, the white rope that bound her hands behind her back and the bed sheet that covered her body.

The Bridgewater Borough councillor's defence lawyer James Ross said his client was innocent and added: 'We intend to fight (these charges) vigorously.'

The criminal complaint, filed to District Attorney Anthony J Berosh, said Hopkins had admitted to being Walsh's lover when interviewed seven hours after she was found.

But Hopkins, one of three Republicans elected to the council in 2010, denied he had killed her. And he said it had been a month since they had been intimate in her home.

Berosh did not discuss a possible motive for the murder. And he did not say whether Hopkins had made a statement after being arrested at his Mulberry Boulevard home.

But he revealed Hopkins had carried out construction work on one his alleged victim's houses.

Walsh's brother, Francesco Caltieri, 52 and living in Columbus, Ohio, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the arrest was 'the start of closure'.

He said: 'Thirty-two years is a long time. Certainly there were a lot of times we thought (an arrest) would never happen. The heartbreak still comes back, (but) Janet will finally have closure.'

The arrest has left the 850 residents of Bridgewater, which lies on the banks of the Beaver River, in shock.

Tim Phillippi said: 'When I heard (about the arrest) on the news, it shocked me. I couldn't believe it. I always thought he was a real nice guy. I never in a million years would have thought this.'

Rod Weaver, a neighbour, said Hopkins was 'always very friendly to me. I would see him in the backyard and he would say, 'Hi! How are you doing?' We never had any problems.'

And Tony Dorazio, co-owner of Precise Automotive, said Hopkins 'has always been a good neighbour in the 26 years I've been here. Scott's always been friendly, very friendly.

'We borrow stuff off him, he plows (the parking lot) for us. I don't know that I've ever seen him angry. He always has a pretty cool head on his shoulders.'

Walsh was said to be a popular but quiet girl at Monaca High School, from which she graduated in 1975.

Sources said she married soon after high school, but then separated. In the process of divorce in 1979 she moved into a house on Indiana Avenue that her parents owned.

She had no children, lived alone and was working for a Monaca refrigerator company.
