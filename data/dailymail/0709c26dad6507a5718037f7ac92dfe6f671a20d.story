TV stars from The Only Way Is Essex were today left 'absolutely devastated' after the mother of former cast member Peri Sinclair was crushed to death when a barn at her country home collapsed.

Mandy Fowell, 49, died after a large brick shed gave way at her £500,000 home in Abridge, Essex, during the recent fierce storms.

Ms Fowell's partner, who was in the house at the time, called the emergency services and she was treated by paramedics for leg injuries.

But she went into cardiac arrest at the scene after suffering with breathing difficulties and died before arriving at hospital.

Cast members Sam and Billie Faiers 
'could not believe it', their mother said, and have sent tributes for 
the funeral - while Joey Essex said his 'thoughts and best wishes' were 
with Peri and her family.

Peri has created a memorial to her mother in the window of Bizara, the greetings card shop she runs in Brentwood, which featured in the ITV series.

A large picture of blonde Ms Fowell with the word 'unique' printed above it was put up inside the shop’s front window this week reading: 'In lovely memory of our beautiful Mandy Fowell. Forever in our hearts 1965-2014'.

The 22-year-old left the series in 2012 saying she wanted to concentrate on 'business and going onwards and upwards'.

She
 now works full-time in the card shop which creates hand-made, 
personalised cards for customers. It is thought Peri will now take over 
the business.

The incident happened on February 7 at about 4pm - at the time there were severe gale force winds of up to 80mph and more than 140 flood warnings across England and Wales.

An assistant manager at nearby The Blue Boar pub, which features in the series, told the Evening Standard: 'We saw lots of ambulances and police cars driving past but we didn’t know what had happened.'

'Peri’s a lovely friendly person - I can’t imagine what she’s going through.

'Anyone
 who loses their mum will be devastated. She’s got a younger brother and
 a dad so they all have just got to stick together. It’s terrible.'

Suzanne Faiers, mother of TOWIE stars Billie and Sam, also spoke of her shock.

Speaking at Minnie's Boutique - the clothing shop set up by her daughters - she said: 'She was really bubbly and a lovely character, always chatting and she loved what she did and had a real passion for it.

'Sam and Billie could not believe it when they heard what has happened. They were absolutely devastated. It was really surreal to be told that Mandy had died.

'It sounds like a tragic, tragic accident and I really feel for Peri. The girls have sent their tributes to the funeral.'

Peri Sinclair, a close friend of Sam and Billie Faiers, was a new addition to The Only Way Is Essex cast for the third series.

She first appeared in TOWIE in 2011 as the ex-girlfriend of fellow cast member Mario Falcone.

In her first few episodes she was seen arguing with Mario in the street after she claimed he used to label his now former girlfriend Lucy 'ugly' before they started dating.

Later Peri insisted she was telling the 
truth about Mario when she was confronted by Lucy in her shop 
Bizara Cards in Brentwood's Crown Street.

She left the ITV series in 2012 citing 'wanting to concentrate on 'business and going onwards and upwards'.

Fellow cast member Joey Essex said: 'My thoughts and best wishes are with Peri and her family at this very difficult time.'

Nextdoor,
 Sue Page, owner of the Bridge Street Cafe, paid tribute to the popular 
shop owner who was on good terms with all the  nearby traders in the 
town which is home to hit show TOWIE.

She said: 'Mandy was very pleasant, a really lovely lady - it is absolutely terrible what has happened.

'It's just so tragic - we are a really close community here amongst the shops and it has really hit the street hard.

'I was stunned when I was told what had happened.'

A spokesman for Essex Police said that they were called at 4.30pm by the fire brigade who said there had been a fatality.

The
 spokesman said: 'We were called to reports there was a female in a 
brick built shed which had collapsed on her. She was found by her 
partner who was in the house at the time.

'Officers
 attended, but there were no suspicious circumstances and it appears to 
be a case of a tragic accident, possibly due to adverse weather.'

Her funeral was due to be held yesterday.
