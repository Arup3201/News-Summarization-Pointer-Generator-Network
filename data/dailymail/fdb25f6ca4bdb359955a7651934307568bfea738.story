Steven Gerrard is set to quit England after the World Cup - whatever the outcome in Brazil.

The Liverpool midfielder leads Roy Hodgson’s squad into the tournament as skipper and recognises that to play on for the next two years - having just extended his contract to 2016 – he won’t be able to continue at international level.

Sportsmail understands that Gerrard has come to the conclusion that the time will be right to call time on England days after this World Cup, with Frank Lampard likely to do the same.

Celebration: But Steven Gerrard is ready to call time on his international career after this summer's World Cup

Same: Vice-captain Frank Lampard is also likely to retire internationally at the end of this year's tournament

Last week Brendan Rodgers backed Gerrard to bounce back from the disappointment of Liverpool’s title failure as they compete in the Champions League for the first time in years.

'I just think he'll need to assess things after Brazil, as he'll be 34 then,’ the manager said.

‘He's been a brilliant captain for me, a great leader, and a brilliant man. His condition is terrific. But next season, there will be a big demand. If he comes and asks that, I'll give an opinion on it [but] I think it's a decision he has to make.

‘He's a very clear vision of the game, and what he wants to do for Liverpool. He loves playing for England. He'll go and concentrate on England and we'll see what happens after that.’
