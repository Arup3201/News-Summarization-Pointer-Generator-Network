Britain is set to be struck with one more icy blast before the 'Big Freeze' comes to an end as temperatures are set to rise on Sunday.

Parts of the country will bask in a balmy 9C but not before icy showers sweep in from Scotland across central and south-east England this evening with lows of -1C.

The milder weather towards the second half of the weekend will bring an end to a bitterly cold week, where temperatures plummeted as low as -13C and large parts saw a layer of snow.

But a fresh wave of freezing showers has forced the Met Office to issue ice warnings for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England from this evening until 10am tomorrow.

Forecaster Kate Brown told MailOnline: 'Rain around southern Scotland and northern England will continue moving south east across the rest of the UK tonight, through until about 4am.

'Behind that across the north will be wintry showers, bringing with it a tiny bit of hill snow - mostly restricted to Scotland, Northern Ireland, Cumbria and Northumberland - and maybe some hail elsewhere.

'Temperatures will be somewhere between -1C and 1C tonight - closer to 1C the further south you are where there are more clouds. While tomorrow we are looking at 6C across most of the country and a slightly milder night further north - more likely somewhere between 2C or 3C.

'It will be slightly colder in the south tomorrow night where there are less clouds, but we are not looking at a big freeze like we have been.' 

Met Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey added: 'It is getting warmer. On Sunday temperatures are going to get warmer. We could be looking at 7, 8, maybe even 9C in parts of South England. But it will be overcast for most people.

'Those warm spells are set to continue on Monday and into next week, but the weather will flip-flop between cold and mild air.

'Temperatures will start to move more towards the average for this year.'
