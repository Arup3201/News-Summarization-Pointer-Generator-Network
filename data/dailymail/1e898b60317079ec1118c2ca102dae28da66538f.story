An Arizona schoolgirl who had her Instagram profile taken over by an imposter has been told by police there is nothing they can do to help.

Reve Osheel, 12, was horrified when she realized someone had been sending bullying messages to her school friends from an account in her name.

But when her mother, Brooke Barr contacted the police she was told that although it was mean, because her daughter had not been directly harassed there was nothing they could do.

Upset: Reve Osheel says she feels hurt after someone set up a fake Instagram in her name to bully her friends

Ms Barr said that her daughter had been ignored at school because of the nasty comments being posted under her name.

Reve, who has Tourette's syndrome, had already been bullied at school because of her illness, but because of the fake account she has been picked on even more.

'It makes me feel kind of sad and just weird. I don’t know why someone would do this to me, and hurt me and my friends,' she told ABC News.

Ms Brooke, who shares an Instagram account with her daughter, first realized that an imposter was posing as her daughter when she saw that a Reve_Osheel had 'liked' a photo.

After checking with her husband if he had given their daughter permission to have her own account, she started to try to trace who had created it.

'The photos were all taken from Reve’s 
account that I monitor. They took screen shots, edited them and 
re-posted. They looked very believable,' Ms Barr said.

Because the family's real account is private, Ms Barr believes that whoever set up the fake Instagram knows her daughter.

The imposter has already sent 35 posts, and has 83 followers, but the account is being used to harass Reve's friends.

Ms Barr said that one post read: 'You are such a brat, [explicit], 
[explicit]. And, like, you think 
you're popular but you're not. So stop acting like one and you will 
never be one because you are a [explicit].'

The mom has approached her daughter's school friends, the police and Instagram to try to stop the account, and to explain that Reve is not to blame.

She believes the imposter could be a child at Reve's school, and speculated that because her daughter had spoken out after being bullied, she had been made a target.

Sergeant William Sanger said the police were unable to take action, but that he wished the department could do more. 

'It’s a pretty crappy thing to do, but 
it's not criminal in nature. If they start making threats or something 
then that’s different,' he told ABC News.

When Ms Barr contacted Instagram she was told that unless she had a warrant they were unable to share private information.

The social network later stated the imposter's account was currently listed as not active.

'All I want to do is find out who this is. Why can’t I trace the IP address to see who did this?' Ms Barr said.
