It's not often a tomato is described as so sweet 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it' - but this was no ordinary piece of fruit.

The heart-shaped tomato was grown by retired dagger maker, Rod Matless, who said he was shocked when he noticed it in his greenhouse while inspecting his latest produce.

Mr Matless, 69, who suffered a heart attack a few years ago, was so taken aback by the phenomenal fruit that he decided to sell it at auction and donate the proceeds to the British Heart Foundation.

Look of love: Rod Matless lovingly holds up the heart-shaped tomato that sprouted in his greenhouse - the gardener sold the fruit for £16 and donated the cash to the British Heart Foundation

The 2.26oz tomato was bought for £16 on eBay by a woman from Wales - who said she planned to give it to someone special. 

Mr Matless, of Wymondham, near Norwich, said: 'It was a bit of an obvious thing to do I suppose.

'I spent a couple of days thinking about it and I wasn't really sure, but this seems like a good use.

'I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good.' 

He added: 'It's very sweet - whenever people see it they just want to hug it.'

But with the tomato's freshness a key factor, enthusiastic gardener Mr Matless was up against the clock to deliver it to its new owner before rot set in.

He said: 'I didn't want to send someone something horrible. I probably could have raised a bit more money with more time but I was worried about it.

Good cause: Mr Matless said that 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it...I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good'

'It will certainly make a nice present for a loved one.I hope that they like it and I'm glad I got to help.'

'It's all been very good fun and I've really enjoyed growing this very special tomato.' 

The French once called tomatoes 'pomme d'amour', meaning love apple, but some say this is because they believed it was an aphrodisiac and had little to do with its shape.
