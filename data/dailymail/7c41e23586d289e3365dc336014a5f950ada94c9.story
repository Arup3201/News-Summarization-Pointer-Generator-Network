A jealous husband who took his former wife's cat before dumping it at the end of her road has today been cleared of theft - despite the fact that she didn't see the animal again for four months.

Jonathan Brewster, 45, told police that he had taken Tracy Brewster's beloved ginger cat Marmalade from her home in Maidstone, Kent, while she was at work in July last year.

He said he took the pet in a fit of rage after an argument, intending to take it to his house, but relented at the last moment and left it 200 yards down the road, intending for it to walk back.

However, the animal got lost and wasn't found until four months later, 40 miles away on the side of a motorway in Surrey.

Missing: Mr Brewster said he intended to take the animal to his house, but relented and let it out at the end of the road. However the animal got lost and wasn't seen again for four months

Marmalade, known as Marmie, was only located after Mrs Brewster began a social media campaign which attracted the support of poet Pam Ayres and Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson.

The awareness drive, which also involved sponsored walks, raised more than £1,300 but cost Mrs Brewster, a mother-of-two, her job as a housekeeper.

But Sevenoaks Magistrate's Court today ruled in Mr Brewster's favour today after concluding that he did not intentionally deprive Mrs Brewster of the cat - a key condition of a theft conviction.

The court heard that, the day before her pet went missing, Mr Brewster emailed his brother and said he was 'going to ruin the b****'s life', and said he wouldn't 'rest until she lost everything'.

Magistrates in Sevenoaks, Kent, heard how Mr and Mrs Brewster had been separated for two years and were trying to 'rekindle' their relationship in early 2014.

But Mrs Brewster, 52, ended the relationship for good in May last year and Mr Brewster, a contracts manager for a property company, took the 'relationship breakdown badly'.

She changed the locks on her door after her estranged husband turned up unannounced on 12 July. On 21 July came home to find Marmie missing.

Mrs Brewster phoned her sister-in-law, who said Brewster had sent his brother an email the previous day that read: 'As for divorce I'm going to ruin the b****'s life and won't rest until she's lost everything just like I have'.

The court heard that Mrs Brewster twice confronted her estranged husband about stealing the cat, but each time he denied it and said it must have 'gone off to die somewhere.'

Distraught by the loss of her pet, Mrs Brewster enlisted supporters - dubbed 'Marmie's Army' - to try and raise awareness on social media. 

The push attracted over 3,500 Twitter followers including Made In Chelsea's Lucy Watson and actress Linda Robinson. Her Facebook page 'Find Marmie' attracted over 4,000 likes.

Mrs Brewster also organised a 50-mile walk while dressed as Garfield to raise Marmie's profile. 

She spent so much time organising the events that she lost her job as a housekeeper, the court heard. 

Mrs Brewster added the cat was found between the A26 and M23 by a couple who said they did not want the reward, but she sent them money anyway. 

Mr Brewster helped Tracy put up posters and look for Marmie but Mrs Brewster said he was 'jealous' of the cat and was only using the opportunity to get closer to her.

She eventually 'called his bluff' and told him a neighbour had CCTV of him taking the cat and Brewster called the police and told them he had taken it, the court heard. 

Mrs Brewster told the court: 'I was devastated. I couldn't believe he would want to hurt me and Marmie in that way.

Distraught: Mrs Brewster, pictured with Marmie, said she was 'searching for days' when she discovered her pet was missing. She said her estranged husband text to say that he had taken Marmie

'I was searching for days. I texted John to say he'd been seen on CCTV, that my neighbour had CCTV and she was going to be back from holiday and look at the footage. 

'The camera was fake but I hadn't realised that at the time.

'He texted me to say he'd taken Marmie and he hadn't hurt him and he was sorry.'

On July 29, Mr Brewster admitted to police that he took the cat and planned to take it home to Essex.

He claimed it was a joint-owned cat and left it 200 yards from the house as he didn't actually want it and it was a silly thing to do.

Piers Restell, prosecuting, said Brewster admitted in a text that he had dumped the cat - but said it was only up the road and not in Surrey as Tracy suspected.

Mr. Restell said: 'He texted to say sorry, he hadn't hurt him and had put him on the corner of the estate and it was wrong to do it.'

Mr Brewster then told police in August: 'What happened is we had a right big fall out, I was going to take the cat back to my place then I changed my mind.

'I thought it was stupid so I left it on the corner.'
