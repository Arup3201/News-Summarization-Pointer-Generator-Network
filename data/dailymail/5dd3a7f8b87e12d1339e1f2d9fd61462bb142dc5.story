Victim: Sylvain Mollier was shot seven times as he cycled near Lake Annecy in September 2012

This is the first picture of the cyclist shot dead  in the French Alps along with three members of a British family in a horrific quadruple murder.

It features in a French television documentary to be screened today about the still-unsolved killings in a forest lay-by near Lake Annecy in September 2012.

The cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, 45, was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin.

Nearby, three occupants of a BMW car, Saad  al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were also killed. Each was shot three times.

The al-Hillis’ two young daughters, Zeena and Zainab, survived and are now in the care of immediate family in England.

The Anglo-French inquiry into the crimes continues to presume that the British family, from Claygate, Surrey, were the intended target of the gunman but there have been claims that it might have been Frenchman Mollier.

Detectives have focused on a dispute Saad  al-Hilli had with his brother, 54-year-old Zaid, over their father’s inheritance.

While every detail of the al-Hillis’ lives has been made public by the French and openly analysed by prosecutors and police, little has been disclosed about Mollier.

This has prompted the makers of today’s documentary, entitled Non Elucidé (Unresolved), to show the photo and publish it on the internet.

Zaid Al-Hilli, a payroll manager from Chessington, Surrey, was arrested last year, but provided an alibi which was confirmed by police. Officers have also discounted claims that he made a number of calls to Romania to hire a hitman.

Zaid is convinced Mollier was the real target, saying last October: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’

Murder scene: Investigators examine the car in which Said Al-Hilli was killed along with with his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74

Despite the remarks, gendarme commander Lieutenant Colonel Benoît Vinnemann insisted last night that Zaid ‘had a motive’ and that Mollier was unlikely to have been the principal target.

Meanwhile, Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud has admitted that the investigation has been scaled down, and that there are unlikely to be any more appeals for information in the near future - provoking anger from some of those linked to the case.
