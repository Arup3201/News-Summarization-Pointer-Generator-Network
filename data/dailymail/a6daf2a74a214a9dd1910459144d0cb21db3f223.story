Vladimir Putin will ban foreign homosexual couples from adopting Russian children, the government has confirmed.

An amendment restricting foreign 
adoptions to 'traditional' families will be submitted to parliament in 
its autumn session by the government, Alexei Levchenko, a spokesman
for Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets, said on Saturday.

The ban underscores a growing rift between Russia and the West over gay rights.

Vladimir Putin will ban foreign same-sex couples from adopting Russian children

Putin said in April that a French law
allowing same-sex marriage went against traditional Russian values and 
signalled Moscow would take steps to ensure gay couples from abroad did 
not adopt Russian orphans.

Russian
legislation sets several requirements for adoptive parents from abroad 
such as sufficient income and a clean criminal record. But it does not 
mention sexual orientation or address the issue of same-sex couples.

Putin
has frequently championed socially conservative values and courted the 
conservative Russian Orthodox Church during a new term he started in May
2012, after a series of large street protests by mostly liberal 
Russians in big cities.

Homosexuality, punished with jail terms in the Soviet Union, was decriminalised in Russia in 1993, but prejudice runs deep.

A
poll by the independent Levada Center found that 38 per cent of 
Russians believe gay people need medical treatment and another 13 per 
cent said they should face prosecution.

A March poll found that 85 per cent opposed same-sex marriage.

Putin
says Russia does not discriminate, but he has criticised gay people for
not adding to Russia's population and the ruling United Russia party is
backing legislation activists say will amount to a prohibition on 
public support for gay rights.

Western
governments have criticised the legislation and Putin faced protests by
supporters of gay rights on a visit in April to the Netherlands, the 
first country to allow same-sex marriage.

Russian gay rights activists say Putin's statements and the legislation encourage discrimination against homosexuals.

The
brutal killing last month of a man investigators said had told drinking
partners he was gay has fuelled fears of more violence.

Rights campaigners say Russian orphanages are rife with criminal violations, including sexual abuse.

But
Olga Batalina, a lawmaker with the ruling United Russia party, said 
last week that adoption by same-sex families should not be an option.

Russia banned all adoptions by Americans this year in a dispute with the United States over human rights.

About 60,000 children have been adopted 
by Americans in the past two decades, and many Russians disagree with 
the ban, seeing it as a politically driven move depriving children of a 
chance to have a family.

Last
month, a Russian report commissioned by Putin's government found 
so-called 'psychological damage' suffered by a boy who was adopted by two
gay women in the U.S.

Russian authorities accused Marcia Ann Brandt of deliberately deceiving them when she adopted Yegor Shabatalov from an orphanage in Siberia in 2007 when he was five years old.
