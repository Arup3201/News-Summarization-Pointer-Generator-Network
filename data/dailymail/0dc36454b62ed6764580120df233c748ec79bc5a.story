Prince Harry came to the rescue of a lady who lost her hat after a gust of wind blew it off as he made a speech at RAF Honington in Suffolk this morning.

Ever the gentleman, the Prince, 30, rushed to her aid and scooped up the wayward titfer before returning the garment to its delighted owner with a big smile.

Harry's moment of gallantry came just after he had made a speech in which he praised the 'professionalism and determination' of the RAF's 26 Squadron.

March: RAF Honington serves as the depot for the Royal Air Force's contingent of ground troops

The royal, who is fresh from a visit to Kandahar Airbase in Afghanistan, inspected ground troops before presenting No. 26 Squadron RAF Regiment with a new standard.

The regiment is a specialist unit that focuses on thwarting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks - a role that has put it at the forefront of anti-terrorism efforts.

In a speech in front of servicemen and women and their families, he said: 'This role is vital to UK defence and civil response capabilities; is is also highly valued by NATO.

'Alongside 27 Squadron, it is constantly committed at extremely high readiness to support the combined emergency service and military response to a CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear] incident in the UK.

"Indeed, such is the vital nature of this role that responsibility has been handed over to the remainder of the wing to allow the squadron to be on the parade today.'

He added: 'It is clear that every member of the squadron possesses the determination and professionalism to succeed, even in the most arduous of circumstances.

Smiles: The visit is Prince Harry's second to an RAF base in the space of less than four days

Work: Harry remains a captain in the Blues and Royals but has taken a step back from combat operations

Dedicated: Instead, the Prince has been concentrating on helping injured servicemen and women

Smart: After the parade - and the hat rescue - Harry and the men of 26 Squadron RAF Regiment posed for a group photo

'Traits which have ensured the squadron's success since its formation and that are embodied in this new standard and the proud history it represents.'

A standard is presented to RAF Regiment squadrons every 25 years and represents hundreds of years of history of service to the monarch and to the country.

Royal Air Force Honington is the RAF's centre of Force Protection and is the depot for the Royal Air Force Regiment - the ground-fighting force of the RAF. The regiment protects air bases from attack and is trained in a wide range of RAF protection roles, both at home and abroad.

Harry, himself a trained Apache helicopter pilot - albeit in the Army rather than the Royal Air Force - became Honorary Air Commandant of the base at the request of the Queen in 2008.

Return to Afghanistan: Harry spent Remembrance Sunday with RAF personnel stationed at Kandahar Airfield

He remains a captain in the Blues and Royals but took a step back from frontline combat operations earlier this year in order to concentrate on the Invictus Games.

The Games, which took place in September, saw more than 600 wounded servicemen from more than nine different countries go head-to-head in a range of sports, among them archery and wheelchair rugby.

Harry remains a passionate supporter of charities working to rehabilitate injured troops and, on Tuesday night, joined Canadian rocker Bryan Adams at a photo exhibition dedicated to servicemen and women.

In typical Harry style, the royal joked and laughed with the veterans, quipping to Sgt Rick Clement who lost his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan: 'At least your hair has grown back!'

Speaking of Sunday's trip to Kandahar Airfield, he added: 'The visit [to Afghanistan] was great. Fourteen people collapsed, though, during the ceremony, and it was only 12 degrees heat. But they were from the RAF so that's acceptable.'

All smiles: Harry looked delighted to be back in the Middle East and shared a joke with the airmen on duty

Clown prince: His trademark high jinks left the men stationed at Kandahar Airfield in fits of laughter

Good work: Harry met some of the pilots charged with flying bombing raids on ISIS jihadis

Memories: During the Remembrance service on the base, Harry read a passage from the Bible

Proud: At the end of the visit, the Prince posed for a photo with a group of delighted Tornado pilots
