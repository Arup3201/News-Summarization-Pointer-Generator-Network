A 'happily married' couple are attempting to sue the owners of a website that claims to expose cheaters after they were shocked to find their own photos and malicious posts about them on the social media site.

Jared Powers and Winona Valdez of Sacramento, California, claim they’ve been happily - and faithfully - married since 2009. 

But when Powers recently googled his own name he was stunned to find anonymous posts on Cheaterville.com accusing him of being unfaithful, along with photographs of him and his wife - including on their wedding day.

Happily married? Jared Powers and Winona Valdez of Sacramento, California were shocked to find their details on a site exposing cheaters

When Powers googled his own name he was stunned to find anonymous posts on Cheaterville.com accusing him of being unfaithful

Power said he felt ‘shocked, angry and betrayed,’ after reading that he was allegedly ‘gay, married and having an ongoing affair with another man.' Plus that he was also 'looking for sex on craigslist.’

The couple strenuously deny all the claims made on the site about them. ‘We're very private people. We have an honorable marriage,' Valdez told ABC News.

She claims the photos were stolen from her Facebook page and then posted on the cheating website, which has the tagline: ‘Don’t be the last to know.’

Cheaterville founder James McGibney claims he started the site not to hurt people, but to provide a database of information about two-timers.

The couple are furious about appearing on the site and have filed a defamation lawsuit suing not only the people responsible for the anonymous posts, but also the website's owners

‘It was not started for revenge or malicious intent. It was designed to warn people. And I'm never going to change that thought,’ he told ABC.

Cheaterville provided Powers and Valdez with the I.P. Address 
of the person who posted their photos, but the couple say 
they don't know them.

They are furious about appearing on the site and have filed a defamation lawsuit attempting to sue not only the people responsible for the anonymous posts, but also the website’s owners.

The federal lawsuit claims the couple suffered ‘severe distress, loss of reputation and economic damages’ as a result of the postings.

An attorney for Cheaterville argues that the website isn't legally responsible for content posted by third parties.

According to the lawyer, liability can only be attached to the person who made the statements and cites the example that Facebook isn’t liable if someone defames another person on that social media platform.

The couple claim Cheaterville goes further than just allowing people to air their gripes, which is legal.

They are confident their lawsuit will succeed if they can argue that the site actually helps users create content, because its business plan is specifically based around attracting slanderous and libelous comments.
