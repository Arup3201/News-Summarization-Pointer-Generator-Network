A majority of Americans who received government subsidies to help pay for their Obamacare insurance policies will have to give some of that money back when they file their tax returns, according to research published Tuesday by the tax preparation firm H&R Block. 

Those taxpayers will owe about $530 each, on average, amounting to a 17 per cent decrease in the typical tax refund.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Feb. 9 that nearly 6.5 million people who live in the 37 states covered by its HealthCare.gov website would qualify for an Obamacare tax credit this year since htey can't afford to pay the full price for medical insurance.

That means nationwide more than 4.5 million will see part of their April 15 refunds shaved away, according to a Daily Mail Online analysis.

TAX BITE FOR MANY: Portions of about 4.5 million Obamacare insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year

'This is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos,' said Americans for Tax Reform chief Grover Norquist

The tax-prep assistance company based its finding on data collected from its customers during the first six weeks of 2015, finding that 52 percent of those who got Obamacare subsidies in the form of tax credits will have to refund part of the money to the government.

'The level of payback of the Advance Premium Tax Credit is significant in that it's costing taxpayers a large percentage of their refund – a refund many of them count on to pay household expenses,' H&R Block health care and tax services vice president Mark Ciaramitaro said Tuesday.

Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that has long pushed for simpler tax laws and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, told Daily Mail Online that the hit to Americans' bottom lines is a natural consequence of an unwieldy addition to an already mammoth tax code.

ATR president Grover Norquist called it 'another Obamacare unpleasant surprise.'

'This is what happens when you write 3,000 page laws in the basement with lobbyists and egghead theorists managing the chaos,' Norquist said. 

'$530 is a slap in the face reminder that "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch".'

When Americans first used the chronically troubled Healthcare.gov website to enroll in coverage at the end of 2013, the Department of Health and Human Secrvices used their 2012 income to determine how much of a subsidy they would receive.

But many people earned more in 2013, and still more in 2014. For them, subsidies based on their 2012 incomes would later turn out to be too high.

'This income underreporting has led to a majority of Marketplace-enrolled taxpayers paying back a portion of the tax credit,' Ciaramitaro said. 

'The average tax refund for these taxpayers was almost $3,100 but it was reduced by $530 due to the tax credit reconciliation process.' 

Norquist's group said the people affected by the unexpected tax-day hits to their wallets are law-income earners.

'Higher income taxpayers received no tax subsidy and aren't facing this tax season surprise,' ATR explained. 

'Families of four earning less than $97,000 are eligible for a credit. So is a single mother with two children earning less than $80,000 and an unmarried/childless taxpayer earning less than about $12,000.'

Families that earn even less are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded medical plan whose new enrollees have comprised most of the newly insured under Obamacare.

The Internal Revenue Service, which administers the Obamacare tax-credit program and collects taxes on behalf of the U.S. Treasury, is already dealing with a shortage of staff because of budget cuts.

It's unclear how that situation will affect the first year's settling of the Affordable Care Act's tax dust. 

But the iRS is already slowing down the program that audits taxpayers' annual paperwork to recover unpaid or underpaid taxes. Last year the agency performed the fewest audits in a decade, and this year the number is expected to be even lower.

'The math is pretty simple,' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Tuesday in a speech to the New York State Bar Association. 'There are fewer audits because we have fewer auditors.'

Americans who bought Obamacare insurance in 2013 and 2014 based their subsidy calculations on their 2012 income levels

@highlight

More than half of those earned more than they estimated, meaning they qualified for a smaller subsidy than what they got

@highlight

Those affected are all lower-income and middle-class people who earn too much to qualify for Medicare but still qualify for subsidies
