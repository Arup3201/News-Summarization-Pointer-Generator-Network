Synthia Nath thought she was a winner at the Face Of Beauty International awards.

That was until organisers told her there had been an 'honest mistake' and that 'another Indian girl' had actually won the pageant category for most photogenic.

In an embarrassing series of events, the New Zealand Herald reports that the 19-year-old Fijian native was first told to raise $3000 to travel to Turkey for the Miss Globe International pageant after winning her local crown at the Face Of Beauty International event in Papakura on May 10.

'They told me, 'Do you have $3000?,' Ms Nath said, according to The Herald.

'I was shocked, I was like, 'Aren't you supposed to give me the money?' They were like 'No' and asked if I had the three grand or not.'

Ms Nath had already spent $1000 on her dress and entry fee and told Face Of Beauty executive Milagros Manuel she couldn't afford the $3000 for flights.

She was reportedly told to 'give the crown and sash back' if she couldn't raise the cash.

The next day she rang back organisers and was reportedly told 'I mixed up the name somehow and it was another Indian girl that should have won.'

She was forced to hand her sash and crown to the rightful winner, but told in an email 'You can keep it and pretend that you still are Miss Globe.'

Ms Nath is now seeking an apology and compensation for the $500 entry fee and $420 for 10 tickets she sold to the event.

The New Zealand Herald reports Ms Nath was confused for Fijian-born contestant Loriza Latif. Lydia Smit was announced the overall winner of Miss Globe New Zealand.
