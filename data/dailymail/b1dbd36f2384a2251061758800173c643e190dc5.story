Dominic Cummings, right, blasted David Cameron claiming he had 'no priorities, focus or grip' and 'babbled like an uber-pundit'

Michael Gove was embroiled in a fresh row with senior colleagues last night as his closest ally mounted a furious attack on ‘bumbling’ David Cameron and his ‘clueless’ senior staff.

Amid signs of growing exasperation at No10, the Education Secretary was forced to deny that an extraordinary outburst by Dominic Cummings reflected his own views.

Mr Cummings was Mr Gove’s right-hand man for years until he left the Government in January and is close to the Education Secretary.

He said Mr Cameron had ‘no priorities, focus or grip’ and thought the job of Prime Minister was ‘babbling like an uber-pundit’.

‘As Bismarck said about Napoleon III, Cameron is a sphinx without a riddle,’ he added.

He dismissed Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, as a closet Lib Dem and a ‘classic third-rate suck-up-kick-down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court’. And he said of director of communications Craig Oliver: ‘He’s just clueless.’

In an interview with The Times, Mr Cummings also attacked civil servants for obstructing Mr Gove’s reforms. He suggested the Government’s biggest failure in education policy was in not scrapping GCSEs.

He claimed the Education Department was a ‘basket case’ that faced a ‘disaster every half hour’ when he joined as Mr Gove’s special adviser in 2011 – a rate that went down to once a fortnight by the time he left.

Mr Cummings said of No10: ‘To get anything done you have to have priorities and there are no priorities. Everyone is discouraged from telling the truth to important people. There’s no grip, no focus. I thought it was a shame... we could have gone faster, further, better.

‘MPs have no real knowledge of how to function other than via gimmick and briefings. That’s also how Number Ten works. It’s how all of them are incentivised to operate. You get ahead by avoiding cock-ups and coming up with tactical wins, you don’t get ahead by solving very hard problems.’

He suggested the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne had struggled to impose their will on recalcitrant civil servants.

Mr Cummings added: ‘Poor David and George – neither of them has worked in a large, complex organisation that’s well managed. They’ve got nothing to compare it to. All they see is very smart, well-dressed people who are quite like them, who click their heels and say, “Yes Chancellor, yes Prime Minister, we’ll sort your problem tomorrow”. But nothing happens.’

No10 said last night that Mr Cameron had the ‘highest regard’ for those criticised by Mr Cummings.

A Cabinet source said colleagues were ‘sick and tired’ of clashes between Mr Gove and his team and other ministers. He has recently been embroiled in public spats with his deputy David Laws and Home Secretary Theresa May.

Although Mr Cameron appeared to back Mr Gove last week, some senior Tories insist he should be moved in a forthcoming reshuffle.

A source 
close to the Education Secretary said of Mr Cummings’ comments: ‘These 
are not Michael’s views.

He disagrees with what he said about Number 
Ten. Dominic says and does exactly what he wants, as was often the case 
while he was working for Michael.’

Deputy
 Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was described by Mr Cummings as ‘a 
goner’ who was regarded with ‘contempt’, said Mr Cummings obviously had 
‘serious anger-management issues’. ‘The only good thing you can say 
about him is he spreads his bile evenly across the Coalition,’ Mr Clegg 
added. Defending his comments, Mr Cummings tweeted: ‘I thought I’d been 
quite mild given the reality.’

Labour
 ex-minister Meg Hillier said she found it hard to believe  Mr Cummings 
‘didn’t have  some understanding with Michael Gove before coming out 
with  this criticism’.
