'Indefensible': Speaker John Bercow and his wife Sally, who have three young children, have previously said their nanny was 'live-in'

The Commons Speaker is facing a storm of criticism after it emerged his children's nanny lives in a taxpayer-funded apartment in the Houses of Parliament.

John Bercow - who earns over £140,000 per year and has backed calls for pay rises for MPs - and his wife Sally have given their nanny the run of the housekeeper’s apartment near their own palatial rooms inside the Palace of Westminster.

The nanny’s accommodation in the Commons is entirely covered by the public purse, including the council tax and utility bills.

The arrangement has been described as 'indefensible' by a former chairman of the Standards in Public Life committee.

The Bercows, who have three young children, have separately acquired a riverside property nearby for £935,000 just four miles away.

Previously the couple said that their nanny was ‘live-in’.

But
according to details released after a freedom of information request, 
it now transpires that she lives in a separate flat consisting of one 
bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and a living room.

Renting such a property in the prime 
SW1 postcode near Westminster could cost at least £2,000 a month, or 
closer to £4,000 for the most well-appointed property.

Taxpayers are picking up the bill for the Band G property, which Westminster City Council charges £1,141 a year for.

Late
last year, the couple bought another Thames-side apartment in an 
exclusive, gated development in Battersea, four miles south-west of the 
Palace of Westminster.

The apartment is 3,100 square foot with plenty of room for a growing family and domestic staff.

A
spokesman for the House of Commons said: ‘The House of Commons has for 
many years provided accommodation for previous Speakers’ personal staff.

'The current Speaker 
has a young family and therefore requires full-time childcare support 
(paid for by him), so the former Housekeeper’s accommodation is provided
for a nanny.

The flat consists of one bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a living room. There is no separate utility supply to the flat.

He
added: ‘Accommodation on the House of Commons estate is provided as 
officeholders, and therefore those who support them, are required to be 
available on the parliamentary estate over prolonged periods and at 
unpredictable times.’

Asked whether the Bercows pay tax on the perks, the spokesman replied that the House of Commons did not have the information.

The
Speaker’s wife, Sally, first revealed the family’s childcare 
arrangements on Twitter two years ago, saying: ‘Does John Bercow’s nanny
live rent-free at his grace-and-favour house? Yes. It’s no secret. Or 
scandal.’ She later said: ‘We have a ‘live-in’ nanny. Who lives in. So 
doesn’t pay rent. WE PAY HER SALARY.’

The nanny lived in the flat with her husband. It is not clear if the Bercows still employ the same nanny.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Anyone in the outside world taking on a live-in nanny has to cover the cost of their accommodation and bills, so why should the Speaker be any different? He is extremely well paid and already enjoys a number of taxpayer-funded perks.

‘The full details of all perks and benefits-in-kind enjoyed by him, his family and staff should be a matter of public record, so that they can be properly scrutinised.’

Mr Bercow’s salary as Speaker is £141,504 a year. Nannies who live in are usually paid less than those who have to live outside the home and fund their own rent, meaning that taxpayers could be subsidising the wages for the Bercows’ domestic staff.

Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on Standards in Public Life, which scrutinises politicians’ behaviour, said the arrangement was ‘indefensible’. He told the Mail: ‘I am surprised that in this current climate he cannot cover the costs from his generous salary.

'It is indefensible really that thousands if not millions of people who have childcare costs themselves have to fund the privilege of a flat and all the expenses with that.’
