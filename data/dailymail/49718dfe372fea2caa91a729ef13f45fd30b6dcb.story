A teenage girl who jumped from a road bridge was saved by a man who managed to grab her arm and a probationer police constable who dangled alongside her until help came.

PC Dewayne Hamilton was hailed a hero after he vaulted the railings on the bridge over the A40 in Hillingdon, west London, and put his arm around the girl to stop her falling.

'There was then a terrifying ordeal, lasting several minutes, with the officer and the girl dangling over the road while they waited for further help,' a police spokesman said.

Saved: PC Dewayne Hamilton is brought down from the railway bridge on a cherry picker

They were only saved when London Fire Brigade crews brought in a cherry picker to reach them and bring first the girl, then PC Hamilton to safety.

The drama happened at about 11am today. A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers had only just arrived when the girl, in her mid-teens, jumped from the bridge.

A member of the public managed to grab her arm through the safety rail of the bridge and held on until PC Hamilton was able to climb over and grab her.

As police halted traffic on the busy A40, the London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service attended and were able to get a harness around the girl to help secure her until the cherry picker arrived.

Both paramedics and firefighters went up on the cherry picker to rescue the girl. When she had been lowered to the ground they went back up to bring down the officer.

The girl was taken for treatment by ambulance. 'She did not suffer any serious physical injury during the rescue. Both she and her family are receiving support,' the spokesman said. 

Inspector Lindsey Hannigan, of Hillingdon Police, said: 'This was an incredibly courageous act.

'What makes this even more impressive is that this officer only arrived at Hillingdon Borough one week ago as a probationer constable. 

'His action, which placed his own life in danger, was an extraordinary act of bravery.'

PC Hamilton said: 'I am just so glad I was there and able to make a difference. I have a child about this girl's age and all I could think about was saving her. I am so very happy we were all able to rescue her from danger.'
