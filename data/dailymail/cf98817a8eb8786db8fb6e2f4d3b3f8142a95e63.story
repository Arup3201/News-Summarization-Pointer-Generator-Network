A grandmother took to the roof of her bungalow to protest against her own daughter cutting off her electricity supply in the house they both share.

Catherine Beesley, 60, launched the rooftop demonstration with her husband - complete with placards - in the latest development of an ongoing dispute between the two women.

Mrs Beesely co-owns a £300,000 pounds bungalow with daughter Sue Martin in a leafy suburb of Bournemouth, Dorset.

However, the inside of the four-bedroom home was split in two so they could live separately after the mother and daughter had a falling out.

Mrs Beesley lives with husband Richard in the self-contained converted loft of the property while Mrs Martin shares the downstairs section with her two children.

However, when they returned from a recent holiday, the Beesleys claimed the electricity had been cut off from their partitioned section of the bungalow due to unpaid bills.

The couple say are currently living by candlelight and being given food handouts by a next-door neighbour.

Mrs Beesley, who spent 25 years working for the NHS as an administrative worker, has now taken to the roof in a bid to get her estranged daughter to restore the power.

Wearing fluorescent waterproofs, she spends her days waving placards at bemused neighbours along the suburban street in Redhill, Bournemouth, Dorset.

One banner reads ‘daughter denies mother electric’ and another states ‘paid 4 it, own it, denied it.’

Mrs Beesley, who still volunteers at Bournemouth Hospital, claims she has given her daughter a cheque to cover a recent electricity bill but it was never cashed.

She said: 'This all started a few years ago after I sold two thirds of my bungalow to Sue and her former partner.

'It was fine for a while, I babysat the children and we all got on very well.

'But we had a falling out a couple of years ago and I haven’t spoken to Sue for months. It has broken my heart. The electricity has been off for about three weeks now.

'It's so cold in the loft, we have to wear our coats all the time'

'We’ve got to the point where I had to do something. It is so cold in the loft that we have to wear coats all the time and have no hot water at all.

'For food we rely on instant soup that my neighbour helps me make by giving me flasks of hot water, or sometimes we use a portable gas stove.

'I started protesting on the garage roof on Tuesday because it’s not fair, and I’m staying up here until the electricity is turned back on.

'I own as much of the property as she does and it’s not right that I am not allowed access to it and that I am deprived of electricity.'

Mr Beesley, a 63-year-old retired gas engineer, added: 'I think the whole situation is incredibly silly and I can’t believe it has come to this.

'There is no logic or reasoning behind any of it and I just can’t see why we can’t all live in peace.'

Mrs Martin, who works at the same hospital as her mother as an assistant in the X-ray department, said because they aren’t talking to one another they are unable to resolve the issue between them.

The 42-year-old said: 'When my mother returned from holiday I enquired through her solicitor about how they planned to pay the bills.

'I heard nothing back from the lawyer, so the day before they came back I got an electrician to stop the power supply to the attic.

'I can’t afford to pay for them and for my family and I would have reactivated it as soon as I heard from her solicitor, which I didn’t.

'We haven’t spoken in such a long time it wasn’t the case that we could have resolved it face to face.

'She gave me 120 pounds to cover the water bill but I wasn’t going to cash it in as I only need 30.'

The bizarre situation has similarities to an episode of the 70s classic sitcom Steptoe and Son in which the bickering father and son partition off their house because they can’t get on.
