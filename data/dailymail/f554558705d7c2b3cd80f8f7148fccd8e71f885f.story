A teacher who rubbed garlic on his hands before wiping it on pupils he had chased has been banned from the profession for four years.

Frank White, 61, threw a piece of wood across a 
classroom, struck pupils with wood or his hands, shouted aggressively 
and swore repeatedly, a professional conduct panel of the Teaching Agency was told.

Mr White was also accused of making a racist comment and eating raw garlic to deliberately disgust his colleagues during staff meetings.

The panel said: 'He has behaved in a manner which is wholly inappropriate, intimidating pupils, criticising other members of staff, swearing and making a racist comment.

'When ignoring basic safety requirements is added, we are in no doubt that Mr White’s behaviour amounts to unacceptable professional conduct.'

The hearing was told that Mr White was a design and technology teacher at Witton Park High School in Blackburn, Lancs between 2000 and 2010.

Deputy head teacher Mrs Diane Atkinson told the panel the wood-throwing incident, which had caused fear, had been confirmed to her.

'Unacceptable behaviour': The school held disciplinary proceedings over a number of allegations which ended with his dismissal

She said Mr White had also told a pupil: 'I would probably rip off your head and s*** down your chuffing neck.'

And she also claimed he had told girl pupils that, if they were his daughter, they would have 'a red bum'.

He failed to make sure pupils wore aprons or safety glasses in his lessons and there had been a number of injuries, the hearing was told.

Head of faculty, Christine O’Boyle, said that a large amount of garlic was found in Mr White’s cupboards.

She said that he ate raw garlic before meeting senior staff - telling her this was to make himself repulsive so that meetings would be shortened.

The teacher regularly used four-letter words in front of pupils, the hearing was told, and when the letter 'R' fell off the school sign, he was heard to say: 'Witton Pak. That’s more like it.'

The school held disciplinary proceedings over a number of allegations made about his behaviour between 2008 and 2010. These ended with his dismissal in June 2010.

Mr White was not present at the professional conduct hearing and was only represented for a short time at the start.

Alan Meyrick, agency deputy director, said Mr White had shown signs of 'unacceptable behaviour across a number of areas and over a period of time'.

He added: 'His behaviours fall significantly short of the standards expected of qualified teachers and they have the ability to undermine the public’s trust and confidence in the status and standing of the profession.

'Mr White dealt with both pupils and colleagues in an unacceptable way and his language and attitudes are wholly unacceptable.'

He said that, as the panel had concerns about Mr White’s health, he recommended that he should be allowed to reapply to the profession in four years.

He also has the right of appeal to the High Court.
