Joe Hart was more than happy to let Manuel Pellegrini do the talking on Monday when it came to questions about the England goalkeeper waiting for a new contract offer from Manchester City.

On the issue of being rested for the last two games, however, Hart was more vocal. He does not like it and will probably never appreciate the positives of having a breather. At least not until he is long retired.

This was hardly on the same scale of rebellion as Phil Mickelson with Tom Watson, but it was an awkward moment as Hart sat beside his manager to discuss Tuesday night’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad Stadium.

Even at this early stage of the campaign, the tie has a make-or-break feel to it after City’s defeat by Bayern Munich in their opening Group E match and the Italians’ 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow.

Another defeat for the Premier League champions would seriously damage their hopes of reaching the knockout phase.

Pellegrini is taking no chances and will recall Hart in place of Willy Caballero, who played against Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City.

Hart, England’s No 1, could have talked up the benefits of having a rest or extolled the virtues of squad rotation. He did neither.

‘I want to play every game, that is my nature, my professionalism,’ he said. ‘I am not the manager, just a player. I live by the decisions of the manager.’

Pellegrini sat impassively as Hart continued: ‘We’ve always had good goalkeepers since I’ve been here going back to David James, (Andreas) Isaksson, Kasper (Schmeichel), Shay Given, (Costel) Pantilimon and Stuart Taylor. 

‘It has always been a fight for me to keep my place. I’ve got high standards that I like to keep to, whether I’m the only goalkeeper or one of 20. It excites me. I love challenging for my place and I love playing and that will never change. I will continue fighting.’

But can Hart at least see the benefits of taking a back seat?

He might be Roma’s most iconic player, but Francesco Totti he has never won a game or even scored in his nine visits to England.

Roma have lost their last three games in Manchester. They lost 1-0 twice and were smashed 7-1 in the quarter finals in 2007, all at Old Trafford.

Sergio Aguero enjoys playing at home in the Champions League. He has five goals in his last five home games. It took him 10 games to reach the same total in the league.

Roma have not kept a clean sheet in their last nine games in the Champions League, letting in on average two goals in each. 

‘It’s hard for me to see it that way,’ he said. ‘I’m sure that when I retire I’ll see them but right now I’m not going to see positives.’

That is unlikely to bother Pellegrini. Hart was dropped for seven league games last season and bringing in £6million Caballero in the summer was designed to put more pressure on him.

Further doubts were raised over Hart’s place earlier this month but a magnificent performance in Munich helped end that particular debate, even though he was beaten by a 90th-minute winner from former City defender Jerome Boateng. It’s worth noting that former city defender Maicon is back in town on Tuesday night, as is Ashley Cole.

Hart was asked if he would ever consider following Cole, his former England team-mate, to Serie A. City’s Micah Richards also moved to Italy in the summer, joining Fiorentina.

City have lost three CL games in a row, their worst run in Europe.

Roma hit five past CSKA Moscow on matchday one — their biggest win in European competition.

City have only won two of their eight games against Italian opposition. Both wins came more than 35 years ago.

Roma were the pass masters on matchday one. The three top passers all played for the Italians.

‘Ash was brave to make the move,’ said Hart. ‘I’ve got a lot of respect for the boys who have done it. Micah seems to be loving it out there but right now I’m happy with what’s going on at this club. While I am welcome here, I am more than happy to stay and see where that takes me.’

City have given new contracts to a number of key players in recent months, but Hart is still waiting even though club insiders insist one will be forthcoming.

He let Pellegrini field that awkward question on Monday. ‘Me and Joe know what’s happening with that issue,’ said the City manager, who will be back in the dugout after a two-game touchline ban.

‘But it’s not the most important thing at this moment. We are thinking about Roma.’

City certainly cannot afford to underestimate their opponents even though the Italians have won only once in 14 attempts on English soil. That includes three defeats by Manchester United — most memorably a 7-1 thrashing in the quarter-finals in 2007.

However, Rudi Garcia’s side have a 100 per cent record this season, winning all five Serie A games as well as that convincing victory over CSKA. Only two goals have been conceded.

‘It’s obviously a big game after a disappointing start in Munich,’ said Hart. ‘Luckily it’s not the knockout phase straightaway.

‘We’ve always had tough groups in our brief Champions League history. They are big nights and we all understand you have to do well at home.

‘But we’ve shown that we can play with the big boys. We just need to finish the game off.’
