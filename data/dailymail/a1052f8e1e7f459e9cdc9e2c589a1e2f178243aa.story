Being a model isn't considered the most taxing of occupations, but one clothes horse had her work cut out for her as she staggered down the catwalk at the Central St Martins graduate fashion show on Tuesday.

Dressed in a mult-layered printed dress by student Min Nan Hui the runway star lost her footing as she tried to balance an elaborate headpiece resembling a TV aerial while walking in stacked platform shoes.

Other wacky designs seen at the prestigious show included bulls horn accessories, furry aprons, walking watercolours, shoes made from plastic bottles and a silk parachute worn as a dress.

The show is a chance for the young design talent at the renowned college to show off their final collections to the fashion press and potential employers and buyers in the industry

It is considered a pivotal event for wannabe designers - the pinnacle of a years' worth of work honing each piece - and previous
students have included Sarah Burton, John Galliano, Stella McCartney and Bruce Oldfield.

A young Alexander McQueen was 
famously catapulted to style stardom after stylist and fashion editor Isabella 
Blow bought his entire graduate collection after seeing the show.

Accessories by Cassandra Verity Green included a backpack carrying a live goldfish

Last night's catwalk event showcased the work of 40 students across mens and womenswear categories and ex-student Pheobe Philo, now one of the most powerful women in the fashion industry, led the prize-giving

Giles Deacon, another alumni on hand to give out a prize, told fashion site NeverUnderdressed.com: 'There's some fantastic technical work on show tonight. In my day, you got away with murder.'

Mao Usami took first prize for a 
collection of cartoonish sports jerseys, second was Narae Park with a 
election of clothes and acessories made out of crumpled plastic bottles 
and the third winner of the night was Giacomo Cavallari, with a menswear
collection featuring neoprene and ciré.

Natasha Somerville, a country girl from the South West, has a collection that is unique in that none of the clothes were made using traditional sewing techniques, not a single stitch

Designer Olivia Rubin graduated from Central Saint Martins college

Designer Olivia Rubin is now in her seventh season after launching her first womenswear line after graduating Central Saint Martins College.

Her final collection was part of the graduate show and won immediate attention from the press who cited her printed designs as one of the ‘standout collections.’Rubin carried out placements in any available holidays with couturier Jacques Azagury, Tristan Webber and Jade Jagger. Her persistance and enthuiasm scored her work with Alexander McQueen and John Galliano in Paris, where she assisted with Galliano’s main line collections, designing prints that were chosen for his womenswear lines in 2006.Rubin’s spring/summer 2007 and 2008 collections were short listed for the Fashion Fringe Award Scheme and gave her the platform to exhibit her designs at London Fashion Week. The label has become known for Rubin’s signature graphic prints on a variety of simple yet feminine silhouettes. It is her outstanding prints that have lead to numerous collaborations including ASOS, Oli.co.uk, Very.co.uk and Dune.

Rubin told the MailOnline: 'Seeing the Central Saint Martins (CSM) BA fashion show every year brings back fond yet stressful memories. Once the elation hits that you’ve made it into the grad show (only a very small number out of the whole year are chosen) the pressure mounts up to deliver the best collection possible.

'What I love about CSM is that they encourage creativity to the max-to go out of your comfort zone and create pieces that have never been seen before and that push boundaries. The fashion world always wait with anticipation to see all the collections as you know you will be seeing the next big thing emerge from CSM each year.’
