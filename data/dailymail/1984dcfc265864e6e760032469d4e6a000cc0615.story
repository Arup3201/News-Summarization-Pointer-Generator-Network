Fernando Torres has netted three times since he completed his emotional return to Atletico Madrid earlier this month - and all within 50 seconds of the first whistle or the start of the second half.

The former Chelsea striker is beginning to rediscover some of his best form - which he enjoyed during his spell at Liverpool - and, when he scored 40 seconds into the Copa del Rey quarter-final second leg with Barcelona on Wednesday, he had his third goal from just three shots on target since returning to the Vicente Calderon.

The 30-year-old's first two strikes came against Real Madrid in the second leg of the previous round of the competition - both at the Bernabeu.

Since his return to Atletico, Fernando Torres has netted three times and it seems he love scoring within the first 50 seconds of any half of football he plays.

Here are the timings of his goals... 

49 seconds (into first half) - vs Real Madrid (January 15)

35 seconds (into second half) - vs Real Madrid (January 15)

40 seconds (into first half) - vs Barcelona (January 28)

Incredibly, just 49 seconds into the 2-2 second-leg draw with Atleti's bitter rivals, Torres slotted home past Real keeper Keylor Navas.

Then, just 35 seconds into the second half, Torres was again fed through by team-mate Antoine Greizmann and he found the back of the Real net once more.

A return of just one goal in four months at AC Milan had preceded his return to the club who nurtured him, yet Torres has netted three times in quick succession since arriving back at Atletico.

It seems as if the loan back to a club who he knows so well - and where he is adored - has done him the world of good.

Torres' career had hit a rut following his £50million move to Chelsea from Liverpool in 2011 and it seemed as if he would never recapture the goal-scoring touch that saw him net 38 times in his 110 international matches for Spain to date. 

But three goals in the Copa del Rey have seemingly revitalised Torres and put his career back on track.

And all of them have come almost straight from kick-offs - meaning it seems that the Spaniard's sharpness is finally beginning to return.

It started so well for then hosts, having scored in the opening 40 seconds through fan-favourite Torres
