A Republican congressman from Texas has been accused of trying to damage his rival's reputation with a photoshopped image showing him with Barack Obama.

An image of fellow Republican John Cornyn shaking hands with the President appeared on a website linked to Steve Stockman.

But political analysts soon spotted something appeared to be awry, and claimed that the image had been doctored to try to make Cornyn appear to favor Obamacare.

Fake? The photo, above, appears to show John Cornyn with President Obama

Original: Several media outlets claim the image was doctored from this 2009 photo showing Charlie Crist with Obama

The odd-looking photo first caught the attention of Politico's Burgess Everett, who tweeted a snapshot of the picture on January 21.

Several news agencies found what they say is the original photo, taken by AP in 2009, which showed Obama shaking hands with former Florida Governor Charlie Crist, the Daily Dot reported.

In the version that appeared on the Cornyn Loves Obamacare website, which was launched last week. the image showed the senator shaking hands with Obama.

The website's homepage claims: 'John Cornyn doesn't want you to know the UGLY TRUTH about his intimate, cozy relationship with ObamaCare. He may deny it in public, but John Cornyn LOVES Obamacare.'

Challenge: Republican congressman Steve Stockman's has made virtually no public appearances in recent weeks as questions mount about his campaign's growing debts

A message from Stockman at the bottom
 of the homepage adds: 'I gave up my safe U.S. House seat to run against
 John Cornyn for U.S. Senate because I am willing to risk everything to 
see Obamacare repealed.'

As media outlets claimed the picture was a fake, the picture of Obama and Cornyn was removed from the website. Stockman's office has not released a statement or responded to requests for comment.

Stockman is hoping to beat Cornyn, who he claims is too liberal, in a March 4 election for the Republican nomination.
