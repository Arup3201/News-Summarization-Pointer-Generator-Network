Roy Hodgson admits he will have to manage the expectation around Raheem Sterling as the England forward comes to terms with his growing status.

The head coach revealed that Liverpool's Sterling was devastated to be replaced at half-time during the 5-0 victory over San Marino on Thursday.

But Hodgson believes there will come a time when Sterling needs a longer break. He said: 'We are conscious of managing (the expectation). I don't think it will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it. He is not alone in that. But when Raheem shows signs of not being quite as sharp, not doing as well, trying too hard, that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break.

'That is not the case at the moment and I don't think Liverpool need to worry. His first half against San Marino was as lively as it could have been.

'At half-time I said, "I am taking you two (Sterling and Jordan Henderson) off", and they looked at me like "Don't do that — we want to stay on", and that is quite nice.'

Hodgson has challenged his players to keep up the winning momentum when they travel to Tallinn for Sunday's Euro 2016 clash with Estonia.

He said: 'We must not let anything slip from what we were doing against San Marino, although it will be a bit more difficult.'
