Across the UK, millions have woken up to a
bright and sunny first day of the Easter Bank Holiday - and the clear 
weather is expected to continue for the weekend.

But while the weather might be cheerful, the UK is bare of any blooms, because of the spate of bad weather.

The unseasonably cold winter has wreaked havoc on flower crops, causing them to bloom by up to four late.

Last year a couple were pictured basking in glorious sunshine amid of field vibrant daffodils in Northumberland - a stark contrast to the bleak picture this year

A year later: The fields are bare of any brightly coloured flowers, after harsh weather conditions thwarted the usual blossoming of daffodils

They were hampered further still as snow showers froze the ground and smothered any young shoots.

After weeks of bitterly cold winds, driving rain and thick snowfall, the clouds have parted in time for the four-day break.

The Met Office has predicted sunny spells across the country, with temperatures of around 5C and 6C.

This is still below the average 
temperature for the end of March - which normally sees the thermometer 
creeping into double figures - but will be practically balmy in contrast
to the wintry weather that has punished the UK in recent weeks.

Cold easterly winds will remain firmly in charge of our weather but for the majority of the UK it should be dry.

However, until Sunday the wind will be less strong and it will therefore feel a little less bitter. There will also be some sunshine with the best of this in western areas.

But it will stay cold with frosty nights and sub-zero temperatures forecast for Saturday night.

Rural Wales is expected to experience lows of -3C to -4C, and elsewhere the thermometer will drop to -1C and -2C.

Frank Saunders, Met Office Chief 
Forecaster, said: 'The prospect of drier and brighter weather will be a 
welcome relief for many but the prolonged low temperatures will mean 
that any lying snow will be slow to thaw.

'This will maintain sharp night-time 
frosts and a risk of ice, and people should be aware of the potential 
for tricky driving conditions if they are travelling this weekend.'

Met Office spokesman Sarah Holland 
said: 'There will be an east and west split, as there will be some 
showers along the east coast of the country - but nothing like the last 
few days.

'The sunniest weather will be across the west and north west of the country.

'Because there is a band of high pressure over the UK, we will have more settled weather conditions.'

Almost two million Brits are expected
to fly away this Bank Holiday to escape the Artic chill - around 30 per
cent more than average.

There has also been a rush for last-minute holidays to sunny climes, such as Egypt and Gran Canaria.

Airports and roads across the UK are 
unaffected by the annual Bank Holiday crush, as many people take 
advantage of the weekend to make long trips.

There are no reported long delays, and flight departures remain largely on time.

Ms Holland explained why the recent weather has been so horrendous.

The last relief flight was made in Dromara Hills, County Down last night, to try and save stranded animals

She said: 'March is usually a month 
of contrasts but this March we have predominantly had cold weather as an
area of high pressure has become established to the north of the UK.

'This is what we call "blocked" 
weather, and, with low pressure to the south of the UK the resultant 
easterly winds have brought cold air from Siberia/Western Russia/Eastern
Europe.

'It has certainly been prolonged and the
effects of low temperatures, frost, ice and more recently snow have 
caused significant impacts to travel and infrastructure, with limited 
periods of quieter weather to take stock.

'There are many factors that could be
contributing to the persistence of the blocked weather, such as El 
Nino/La Nina, Arctic sea ice, Solar UV output, the North Atlantic 
Oscillation, and others.

'These don’t work in isolation, but all combine to influence climate on both regional and global scales.

'It may also be a very natural thing as once a blocking pattern sets up, it can last for a number of days or even weeks.

'This
is especially true if the block is particularly well established 
vertically through the atmosphere, as it takes a lot for weather 
patterns to displace it.'

Last night an RAF Chinook makes the final drop of emergency food supplies for animals cut-off by the deep snow drifts in Dromara Hills, County Down.

All air support has now been withdrawn from the relief operation to animals stranded in the snow in Northern Ireland.

RAF Chinook and Irish Air Corps helicopters had been dropping emergency food supplies to farms in high-ground areas of counties Antrim and Down, but the Department of Agriculture said it was now re-directing resources to the ground.

DUP MLA Paul Frew has said it is too 
soon to end aerial support: 'This decision by the Department of 
Agriculture minister will cost farmers more livestock.'

The
helicopters made food drops to thousands of stranded animals, which 
were mostly in the Glens of Antrim which has suffered from severe snow 
fall.

But the department defended its decision and said efforts were being re-focused on the ground.

A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) said: 'Over this week we have worked tirelessly to assist many farmers who have experienced difficulties due to the recent severe weather.'We have assessed the situation on a continuing basis and air support has been stood down for today.

'Given that road access has been dealt with we are now redirecting our resources from aerial support to ground support, and over the next few days we will continue to offer farmers help to move their fodder to inaccessible stock.'

Since Monday, 22 helicopter flights have delivered 46 fodder drops to animals isolated on high ground in the Mourne Mountains and Glens of Antrim.

A further 45 farmers have transported feed to remote areas using DARD's Softrak vehicles.

The milder conditions will bring a huge relief to one couple, who had to abandon their home after they became snowed in.

Barry Jenkins and partner Kate Mason 
were greeted with a huge when they opened the front door of their 
farmhouse in a remote part of North Wales.

They had to dig their way out after drifts almost reached the top of the door frame.

With
food and fuel running low after days of being cut off, and with no sign
of a thaw, the couple decided to leave their isolated home near Glyn 
Ceiriog, near Chirk, and travel on foot through the snow-swept terrain.

On
Wednesday, Barry and Kate packed rucksacks full of provisions and 
clothes as they left their home to escape the Arctic conditions.

They are now staying in Oswestry until conditions improve.
