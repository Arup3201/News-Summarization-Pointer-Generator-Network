Weighing in at more than two tons, this giant rhinoceros would appear to be a dangerous foe even for the bravest animal.

But an eagle-eyed photographer snapped the unthinkable - the humble magpie seems to get the better of the huge mammal.

For the bird was pictured at Whipsnade Zoo, in Bedfordshire, pecking chunks of skin from the one horned rhino and feasting on its flesh.

Brazen: The magpie looks tiny compared to the white rhino it is feeding off but isn't afraid to go nose-to-nose with the beast in order to find ts dinner

Size mismatch: The magpie lands on the rhino's back looking for food

Feast: the bird is pictured having managed to peck its way through the rhino's leathery skin and is feasting on its flesh

Caught on camera: The brave bird is snapped peering over the top of its prey's considerably larger head

In one of the incredible pictures, the brazen bird literally goes nose-to-nose with its huge opponent - pecking at the softer flesh around the beast's face causing it to bleed.

The unconcerned rhino looks aloof throughout and makes no attempt to scare off his feathered foe.

He doesn't shake the bird off because the enormous species are said to have a high pain threshold and don't even notice that the birds are feeding most of the time.

The rhino - one of five species of the mammal that exist - can grow up to 13ft long and weigh in and between two and three-and-a-half tons.

The magpie poses little threat to the overall well-being of the mammal, with the most dangerous threats in the wild coming at the hands of humans rather than animals with poachers targeting the mammal to sell their horns for use in traditional medicines.

Rhinos often find themselves at risk from encroaching settlements and spreading farmland.

Bleeding: The rhino's flesh can be seen where the magpie has landed on its back and pecked through the skin

Sharp: Magpies are known for their strong beaks which are capable of cutting flesh

Hungry: The magpie tucks into the rhino's flesh

Stuffed: The magpie has had its fill and prepares to fly off after its feast

Known as being among the most intelligent animals meanwhile, the magpie is known to have a strong beak with a sharp cutting edge which can be used for cutting flesh.

The species eats mainly plant material in the winter but is known to feed on small animals and birds all year round.

It will occasionally eat larger animals such as rabbits.

The rhinos at Whipsnade live in a £1m development which features indoor heated pools so that the rhinos can 
enjoy their favourite past time – wallowing in muddy water – all year 
round.
