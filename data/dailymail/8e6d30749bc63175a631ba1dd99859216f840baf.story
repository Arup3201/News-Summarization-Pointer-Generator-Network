The legendary Joan Rivers, 81, passed away in New York City on Sept. 4

It was supposed to be a somber occasion with guests mournfully remembering the passing of Joan Rivers during the funereal Jewish custom of 'sitting shiva,' a seven-day period after death when relatives and friends gather to remember a loved one.

But this was, after all, the legendary Joan Rivers — and in the end, the Friday event in Los Angeles turned out to be a star-studded celebration filled with fun memories, irreverence and much laughter.

'It was weird to be at an event like that and have a good time, but I think Joan would probably want something
 like that,' one insider, a close friend of Joan and her daughter Melissa Rivers, tells MailOnline exclusively. 'It's not really a party, it's just more a celebration.'

Guests include actress 
Lily Tomlin, comedy legend Don Rickles, Broadway star Betty Buckley, and Steve Lawrence, of the 60s 
pop duo Steve and Eydie.

'I just loved her,' gushed Tomlin, 75, outside Melissa Rivers' opulent Pacific Palisades home.

'It's very convivial and sweet and loving in 
there,' she added to MailOnline.

'Everybody's discussing her like she's still here — and in a way, 
she is.'

Dozens
 of mourners showed up between 6 and 8pm for the shiva, some carrying in
 wrapped gifts or flowers. Guests of all ages attended, including 
several teenage pals of Joan's grandson Cooper.

Soft
 jazz music was drowned by shrieks of laughter as Hollywood friends and 
family exchanged stories about Rivers, who died in New York on Sept. 4 
at age 81.

A book with pictures of Joan and her daughter Melissa were on display for guests to peruse.

Attendees were treated to 'a lot of really good food and wine, a bar and everyone was dressed 
nice.'

'There was music and it was half indoors, half outdoor in the 
garden,' our spy said.

Comedy great Don Rickles, 88 — a well 
known hero of Joan's for pioneering the 'insult comic' style that she so
 brilliantly adopted — looked frail as he arrived and had to be helped 
out of his car and walked through the door.

 matriarch Kris Jenner showed up in a chauffeured SUV with a friend and 
stayed for just less than an hour at the event.

Melissa Rivers, however, seemed distraught, 'tearful' and 'numb' throughout the event, an insider said.

'How OK can you be when you lose your
 mother?' Steve Lawrence,79, told MailOnline. 'I just saw people just hugging her and comforting her. It was a
 sad, sad occasion.'

Added our spy: 'She looked sad, but she was happy to see everybody. The hard part will be afterward when things calm down and everyone goes back to their life.'

On Sept. 6, a star-studded cast remembered Rivers at New York City's Temple Emanu-El, where they gave her the send-off the comedienne asked for in her 2012 book 'I Hate Everyone ... Starting With Me' — 'a huge showbiz affair with lights, cameras, action' and 'Hollywood all the way.'

The legion of notables who turned out included: Kathy Griffin, whose edgy, biting comedy career was largely made possible by Rivers; Fashion Police costars Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic, holding hands for moral support; Sarah Jessica Parker; Whoopi Goldberg; and Howard Stern.

Theatre stars Bernadette Peters, Alan Cumming and Tommy Tune also attended the service, as did record producer Clive Davis and fashion designers Carolina Herrera and Michael Kors.

TV personalities Barbara Walters, Geraldo Rivera, Diane Sawyer, Kathie Lee, Hoda Kotb and Andy Cohen came to pay their last respects. And moguls Barry Diller, Donald Trump and Steve Forbes also attended the unconventional service.

Guests exited the temple to the sounds of 'New York, New York' on bagpipes.
