With
70ft waves crashing over his upturned boat and 100mph winds whipping his hair,
stricken sailor Rudy Snel had one thought going through his mind - he was going
to die.

The
62-year-old thought: ‘I’ve had a good run. I’ll just have to accept that this
is it.’

As
it turned out, he was wrong.

He
and colleagues Ben Tye, 31, and Jean Pierre de Lutz, 57, lived to tell their
tale, but the Atlantic Ocean came pretty close to finishing them off.

The view from a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter shows the scale of the storm and the size of the raft as they waited to pick up the last two survivors out of three about 240 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina

De
Lutz suffered 11 broken ribs as they struggled with waves that were so powerful
they felt like a truck hitting them.

For
six hours they were marooned on their rescue raft surrounded by ‘the absolute
height of nature’s fury’ as they waited to die.

But
incredibly a rescue team somehow found them after they set off an SOS beacon -
and lifted them to safety.

The
trio have now told their story for the first time in a book which explains just
how close they came to a watery grave.

Their
journey began when de Lutz placed an advert online in 2007 for a crew for his
boat, the Sean Seamour II to travel from Florida to the Azores, then on to
Gibraltar and Saint-Tropez.

De
Lutz was an experienced sailor and had been at sea since his teens whilst Snel
was a retired schoolteacher looking for the trip of a lifetime.

They
set off on May 2 that year, which was deliberately early to avoid hurricanes.
Instead they came face to face with Tropical Storm Andrea.

By
midday on May 6th, when they were 240 miles off Cape Hatteras, NC, several low
pressure systems began to converge with ominous ‘wispy yellow-brown clouds’.

According
to an extract in the New York Post, Snel says: ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen
clouds that colour. They’re so menacing.’

Suddenly
the sky turned dark and winds got to 45 knots (52mph). De Lutz writes: ‘This is
not good. Nothing is going as planned. The weather is not as predicted.’

In May 2007 the three men set sail across the Atlantic aboard the Sean Seamour II to travel from Florida to the Azores, then on to Gibraltar and Saint-Tropez

The
wind escalates to 35, then 60 and then 80 knots. The waves rise to 15ft - then
surge to 50ft.

Author
Michael Tougias, who has written the book with the men, writes: ‘More than one
wave smacks so hard that Rudy likens it to being hit by a truck.

‘Good
God, he thinks, that felt more like a solid object than liquid.’

Come
the next morning, things are even worse when a ‘thunderous boom’ sends Snel
from his bed flying into the air.

Tye
smashes into de Lutz and bounces off him ‘so that his back and buttocks hit the
bulkhead where the TV is mounted; it shatters in a spray of glass and plastic.’

The
Sean Seamour II is sent ‘careening over its starboard side. Objects not bolted
down are hurled through the boat like missiles, and canned soft drinks burst
like rockets, spraying in all directions.’

A
table slams into de Lutz, breaking eight ribs.

The men were hit by subtropical storm Andrea -- a storm so powerful that one ship at sea lost 21 containers and the U.S. Coast Guard would eventually rescue nine people, including Mr. Snel's crew

Tougias
writes: ‘He feels the water climb up the backside of his neck and head,
followed by silence as his ears submerge.

‘He
frantically fights to free himself, but he’s pinned by the tabletop. I’m going
to drown inside my own boat!’

The
other two men wrestle him clear and, in an astonishing display of bravery, de
Lutz swims outside the boat to get the life raft so they can get out of the
boat, which is filling up with 2ft of water.

The
books says: ‘Every movement of the boat causes agony that can’t be ignored.

‘Piercing
pain radiates from his broken ribs...an especially large wave breaks directly
on him, and the mast is pushed down on the left side of his back, crushing him
against the deck.

‘He
moans in agony. Another three ribs are broken.’

The
men manage to scramble into the raft just as the Seamour sinks - with de Lutz
curled up like a baby with blue lips and the beginnings of hypothermia.

Tye
meanwhile is astonished by the ‘white capped mountains of water surrounding
him’. He surveys the scene which he fully expects will be the last thing he
ever sees.

The
book says: ‘One minute a wave towers above the boat; the next minute the vessel
rises to the top, where Ben surveys foam-streaked waves in all directions.

‘He
has never seen such raw power, the absolute height of nature’s fury, and he is
awestruck.’

For
his part Snel realises ‘he is witnessing something only a handful of people on
earth have ever seen’.

They
sit there and wait to die - but not before another giant wave sends them
crashing back into water, forcing them to haul themselves and the
near-unconscious de Lutz back onto the raft.

It
would be six hours before a C-130 plane sent by the US coast guard found them.

Their
SOS beacon had not actually activated, but an older device somehow had.

Rescuer
Drew Dazzo had to be lowered 40ft in 80 knot winds, go into the water and swim
to the raft before winching each of the men up to safety.

The
book makes clear that for all three men, their experience affected them deeply
and that they will never forget it.

In
an interview at the time, Snel put it candidly and said he was haunted by ‘not
just thinking you're dead, but being convinced of it’.
