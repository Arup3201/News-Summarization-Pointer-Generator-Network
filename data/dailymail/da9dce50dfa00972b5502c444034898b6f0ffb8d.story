The New York Police Department is expanding a gunfire-detection system that notifies officers in real time when and where shots are fired, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced.

De Blasio said the NYPD will deploy the system, known as ShotSpotter, throughout precincts in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

ShotSpotter utilizes antennas and acoustic detectors to pinpoint shooting locations. 

The crime center of a police headquarters immediately receives the information, which they can then send out to officers already near the area. 

On Monday Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the New York Police Department is expanding a gunfire-detection system that notifies officers in real time when and where shots are fired 

ShotSpotter's data can also detail for police how many shooters were present and how many shots were fired at the location. 

Seven units will be deployed in Brooklyn and 10 in the Bronx.  

The NYPD plans to eventually incorporate ShotSpotter's alerts into mobile devices, which will allow information to be sent directly to officers' phones and tablets.

The system has been tested by the NYPD since 2011. In December it registered the shots that killed police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in Brooklyn, according to ABC 7. 

On Monday shots were picked up within an hour of the the system's activation in the Bronx, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Jesse Tisch.

Three shots were fired and they were not called in to 911, CBS New York reported. 

According to ShotSpotter's website, less than one in five shooting incidents are reported to 911.

When shootings are called in, the information given is often inaccurate, wasting valuable time and putting the safety of officers and the public at risk, the site said.

During a press conference on Monday, de Blasio said ShotSpotter will 'transform the way the NYPD responds to gunshot activity in our neighborhoods.' 

'ShotSpotter will help protect our residents, our communities and our police officers,' he said. 

Systems similar to ShotSpotter have already been employed in Newark, New Jersey, Atlantic City and Washington, according to Bloomberg News. 

ShotSpotter will be activated in Brooklyn next week.
