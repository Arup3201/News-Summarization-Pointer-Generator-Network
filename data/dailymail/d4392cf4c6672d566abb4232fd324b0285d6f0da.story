In news that may be welcomed by cash-strapped parents, dressing your baby looks set to be become cheaper than buying a pack of nappies.

Britain's cheapest baby wear hits the shelves next week at Poundworld, as research by the retail giant reveals that the annual cost of kitting out an infant for its first year of life is now £9,000.

Customers of the bargain store will be able to snap up a complete outfit for just £2.83, including hat and mittens, while a packet of 45 disposable Pamper nappies retails for £6.99. 

Poundworld are launching an ultra-budget range of baby wear as research reveals that the cost of dressing a child for one year is now £9,000

The new 'boutique' range has been created to fulfill demand for cheaper clothes for babies

The £1 romper suit will be the flagship of the range with accessories being available for pence.

Bargain prices mean parents can now dress their little one in a baby grow (£1), bib (50p), socks (33p) and  hat and mittens (£1) for just £2.83. 

Trading director Chris Edwards Junior said: 'The cost of a new baby for mums and dads can be staggering.

'We've seen a huge demand for a budget baby range in our stores with trial sales of the new range performing incredibly well.

'Everyone wants their baby to be comfortable but still look adorable and so we've had two designers working on our own exclusive quality trend-led designs.'

Poundworld says it is launching the new 'boutique' range of baby wear due to soaring demand.

Featuring over 10 different designs the Baby Bodysuit is made of 100% cotton and comes in sizes 0-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months and 12-18 months

The applique bibs, which are made in China, cost just 50p each and come in several child-friendly designs

The company, which already sells bottles, feeding dishes, rattles and baby wipes, say trial runs of the cheap baby wear were snapped up by poorer parents.

Bosses are expecting more than 100,000 items of baby clothing to fly off the shelves in the first week.

Available exclusively in over 250 Poundworld stores across the country, the 'Oliver and Olivia' range features baby bodysuits in a range of designs for boys and girls.

There will also be accessories such as a three-pack of baby socks, a two pack of applique bibs and baby hats. 

Poundworld customers can now dress their little one for less than £3, including a baby grow (£1), bib (50p), socks (33p) and hat and mittens (£1)

Featuring over 10 different designs in the range, the Baby Bodysuit is made of 100% cotton and comes in sizes 0-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months and 12-18 months.

Kirstin Black, mother to nine month-old Flora who modelled the range, said: 'I didn't expect something that only costs £1 to look and feel so nice.

'If I saw this on the shelves in a high street baby store I wouldn't think twice. I'm always washing baby clothes so it'll be interesting to see how the range holds up after multiple washes.'

A company spokesman said: 'With cute motifs including 'Pretty as a Flower' and 'Little Star', the bargain suit is machine washable and over £6 cheaper than a similar 100% cotton motif design available at popular clothes store, Gap.' 

The Baby grows are made in India with the socks and bibs coming from China.
