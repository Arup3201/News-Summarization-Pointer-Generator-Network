At least three people were dead and dozens injured following a massive train derailment in Canada.Â 

The passenger train was travelling from Niagara Falls to Toronto when it derailed near Burlington, Ontario.

The three people killed were all railroad employees riding in the locomotive at the front of the train when it came off the tracks, according to Canada's Via Rail spokeswoman Michelle Lamarche.

Ms Lamarche told CBC News: 'All three were in the locomotive section. As you can imagine this is terrible for Via.'

Burlington Mayor Rick Goldring said that emergency crews pulled other passengers from the wreckage and at least one air ambulance was on standby.

Mayor Goldring added that the crash caused minor damage to nearby buildings.

Reports from the scene indicated that 
six cars derailed, including two that flipped onto their sides today near the
Aldershot train station.

Three passengers were airlifted to 
hospitals, one with a heart attack, another with a broken leg and the 
third with a back injury.

Forty-two other passengers suffered less-serious injuries and were either treated at the scene or sent to local hospitals.

The locomotive and one passenger car flipped onto their sides and crashed into a small trackside building.

At least two passengers car behind it were driven off the tracks into a L-shape. All six cars derailed, Via officials said.

'There's no question it's very tragic.
We're a relatively small company, we're a family, we know everyone by 
name,' Via chief operating officer John Marginson said at the scene.

'We certainly feel for the families of the colleagues that we lost.'

Deanna Villela of Welland, Ontario, 
said she felt a slight bump before the train jumped off the tracks, 
sending people and luggage flying.

The crash lasted about 10 seconds but felt like forever, she said.

Burlington mayor Rick Goldring also 
confirmed that three died. Mr Goldring said the crash caused minor 
damage to nearby buildings.

Police have not released any details about the accident.

The Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada is sending a crew of investigators to the scene. Ms Lamarche said
they will examine the date recorder on board.

Ms Lamarche said 75 people were on board. About 42 people were reported to be injured in the wreck.
