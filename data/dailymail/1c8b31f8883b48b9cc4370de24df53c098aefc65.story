Prisoners have been sent letters politely informing them not to take drugs and asking why inmates want to escape.

Bosses at Ford Open prison admitted in a letter there had been an 'increase' of Class A drugs and reminded them of the 'risks' of taking them.

Local MP Nick Gibb said officials need to be tougher on drug use inside the prison and said residents expect a 'zero tolerance' approach.

He told Mail Online that there are known 'drop zones' around the Category D prison, which is next to the small Sussex village of Climping.

Prison security chief Esther Dainton wrote to inmates saying: 'We would like to take this opportunity to alert offenders as to the obvious risks both to those using drugs and those who may be in the vicinity whilst others are under the influence.'

In a separate letter inmates were asked why people wanted to abscond from the open prison in Arundel.

The institution has a history of escaped prisoners and in July convicted murderer and burglar Paul Flint went on the run after walking out of the facility.

He was not rearrested until last month.

Ford governor Sharon Jefcut said there had been a 'slight increase' in the number of inmates absconding from the prison.

In a letter published by The Sun, she wrote: 'As a Senior Management Team we would be interested in what your views and perceptions are as to why offenders choose to abscond.'

She did warn that those who absconded faced additional time in custody.

The prison holds about 500 inmates, including serious offenders.

It has previously housed Learco Chindamo, who was jailed for stabbing headmaster Philip Lawrence in 1995, and George Best following his 1984 conviction for drink-driving and assaulting a police officer.

Last year a report on Ford by the chief inspector of prisons found that a third of inmates said it was 'easy to get drugs in the prison'.

Twenty five prisoners had absconded in 2011 and 13 in the early part of 2012.

The inspectorate said it was good practice for bosses to ask prisoners for information about absconding.

However, Mr Gibb said people will be appalled at the seemingly gentle approach taken.

He said: 'They will want officials to be tougher and firmer in terms of drugs policies, and not just hard drugs.

'It should be very clear and say that if they find you in possession of any drug you should simply go into closed conditions.

'Absconding itself presents risks and people disappear into the countryside.'

In 2011, inmates started a riot in the prison after they were ordered to undergo breathalyser tests and several buildings were set on fire.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'We take the illicit use of drugs in prisons very seriously and offenders are made well aware that anyone caught with prohibited items will face swift and decisive punishment.

Â 'This can include having days added to their sentence, being transferred to a different prison and losing privileges.'
