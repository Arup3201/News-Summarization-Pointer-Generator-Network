Six months after the original Pig Dog sent social media sites into meltdown - another deformed canine is beginning to make waves on the web.

Cuda the Pitbull, who has shortened spine syndrome, has amassed a huge Facebook following after pictures of the ugly but strangely cute animal began to circulate on Facebook.

The condition is so rare vets have no idea of its long term effects - but Cuda's owner Julie LeRoy insists the pooch leads a normal and active life at their home in Ulster County, New York.

Internet star: Cuda the Pitbull, who suffers from rare shortened spine syndrome, has achieved online fame

In June, pictures of Pig the dog brought the bizarre and unfortunate affliction to people's attention.  

Now Cuda's Facebook page, created for her entry into the World's Ugliest Dog competition, has proved a huge hit - amassing more than 16,000 followers.

Ms Leroy, 48, said: 'Cuda came to me when I was working as an animal control officer in North Carolina.

'While out on a call, which turned out to be more of a neighbour dispute, a complainant brought her out on a twine leash and told me they needed to give her away because they were moving.

'She looked just like she does now, only half the size.

'I took a photo and texted my husband. I told him I couldn't take her back to the shelter as they would take one look at her and euthanize her.

'He said no, but I won the argument and Cuda came home.

'I later found out these people bought her from craigslist for $50 from a backyard breeder located two hours away.

Cuda's condition became known to the world when pictures emerged of Pig the Dog back in June 

'They only had Cuda a couple of weeks.'

Cuda, named by her previous owners because she looks like a barracuda due to her under bite, came home with Ms LeRoy in 2010.

While she admits to getting some strange reactions to her deformed dog while out and about, she claims most people are very accepting.

She said: 'We can't get more than a few steps wherever we are.

'Everyone wants to know what kind of dog she is and what is 'wrong' with her.

Cuda's Facebook page was launched when she was entered into the World's Ugliest Dog competition in 2010

'Some people feel sorry for her because of her looks but I tell them not to. Most people are delighted with her. That's why I took her to be certified for therapy. She makes people happy.

'I have many of her fans tell me they have her picture on their computer desktop because it makes them smile.' 

Ms LeRoy added: 'We entered her in the World's Ugliest Dog competition because we wanted to create awareness about irresponsible breeding pit bull discrimination.

Cuda was given her name by her previous owners for resembling a barracuda due to her under bite

Unsuccessful: Cuda entered the World's Ugliest Dog competition in 2010 but failed to bring home the crown

'We launched her new page in 2011 as an educational forum for breed specific legislation as well as backyard breeder awareness.

'Now she has over 16,000 likes. I love every one of those people on her page.'

Although vets do not know what the future holds for Cuda due to the rarity of her condition, Ms LeRoy has taken comfort in finding other dogs online with the same condition.

She said: 'We've had a few wonderful vets in our life, but none of them have ever dealt with a dog like Cuda.

The original Pig Dog: Found in woods near Atlanta, Pig was born with severe deformities, but was adopted and nursed by a woman in Alabama, and has gone on to win the hearts people's all over the world

'Meeting parents of other short spine dogs on Facebook has been so helpful because many of these dogs are already seniors.

'We are facing a challenge that no other short spine dog has as Cuda also suffers from diabetes.

'It is not something that we feel was caused by her short spine syndrome, it's just a challenge that we face that is very scary to any parent of a diabetic dog or cat.

'She does live a normal life in every other way. She plays and runs so fast. She is not physically inhibited at all.'
