Steven Gerrard has urged new signing Mario Balotelli to  join the likes of Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler on the list of Liverpool legends.

Gerrard is set to link up with Balotelli for the first time this weekend after the Italy striker penned a three-year deal following a £16million from AC Milan.

The transfer helped soften the blow of losing last season's top scorer Luis Suarez to Barcelona and captain Gerrard believes Balotelli has what it takes to become the next Kop idol.

'He has certainly got the talent and the ability to keep the trend going at Liverpool for top front men,' said Gerrard. 'You go back and there was (Roger) Hunt, (Kevin) Keegan and (John) Toshack, on to Dalglish and Rush, Fowler, (Michael) Owen, (Fernando) Torres and Suarez. All the names are there.

'I hope he goes for it because it will be the making of him. I have told him that. It was the first conversation I had with him. I told him "Mario, it’s there for you". I told him to think of the names that have gone before him and you can uphold the tradition of top strikers at Liverpool.

'We either produce them or find them. This is his chance. If I was in his position, at 24 years of age, I would go and grab it with both hands. I would sacrifice everything I could to grab it. If I was him I would be thinking “I want to have goals, medals, big European night from my Liverpool career”. It is all there for him.'

The Reds won their Premier League opener - at home to Southampton - but lost to Balotelli's former club Manchester City on Monday night.

Early top-flight leaders Tottenham provide the opposition this Sunday and Gerrard added: 'It’s down to Mario now. We will back him and work as hard as we can for him and he has got to do the same for us. Him and Daniel Sturridge, the hard work starts with them. We follow behind. They are the two key men moving forward and it is going to be interesting.

'Suarez has gone now so Mario and Daniel have got to keep that tradition going. That is the position the fans cling on to. If they start well and start scoring goals, there is a massive army waiting to show them so much adulation.'
