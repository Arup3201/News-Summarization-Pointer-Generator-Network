Troubled: James Hammonds died after jumping from a bridge in Bristol in June last year

A teenager battling a shopping addiction committed suicide after stealing thousands of pounds from his mother to feed his compulsion, an inquest has heard.

James Hammonds struggled with depression and obsessions since the death of his father in 2008.

The 19-year-old leapt to his death from a bridge after a night out with friends in Bristol on June 29 last year.

An inquest heard the shop assistant indulged in a 10-week spree, secretly transferring £7,780 from his mother Elizabeth Hammonds' bank account, to buy clothes online and to fund nights out.

But when his mother confronted him, demanding he get help, Mr Hammonds threatened to kill himself.

Days later Ms Hammond reported her son missing. His body was discovered on July 4.

Ms Hammonds told the inquest: 'It was when he was at college I noticed James was depressed.

'He was struggling to get out of bed. He displayed obsessive behaviour - cleaning and often throwing things away having recently bought them.

'The £6,000 he got in inheritance, he just blew the lot. He had a shopping addiction and this was where a large sum of money was spent.

'I was shocked [when I realised he had taken the money] and I thought it was his compulsive shopping disorder.'

Ms Hammonds, from Eastville in Bristol, said she discovered her son had been stealing money since April 2013, when he was on holiday in Magaluf, Spain last June.

The day after he returned she confronted him, telling the teenager if he did not get help she would go to the police.

Mr Hammonds, who lived with his mother, confessed that he was 'seriously depressed' and thinking about killing himself, prompting Ms Hammonds to call the family GP.

Obsessive: The 19-year-old shop assistant had battled depression and obsessions including an addiction to shopping since his father died in 2008 of a blood clot

James Hammonds' family today paid tribute to the 'intelligent and much-loved' teenager.

They said his shopping addiction was a 'serious problem' but they had no idea how much he had spent on designer clothes and trainers.

Speaking at the family home yesterday, his mother's partner Jason Sparkes, 43, said: 'He was much loved and respected by his family and friends.

'He was depressed and what he did was totally out of character.

'He was well liked by everyone who knew him and his colleagues at Ikea presented a lovely book of condolence about him. Nearly everyone commented on his great sense of humour.

'He was just a typical 19-year-old boy.'

Speaking about his compulsive shopping, Mr Sparkes added: 'I don't know how common it is but it was a compulsion for internet shopping and he did have a real problem. It had gone quite far.

'It was mostly clothes and trainers - he liked to look good.

'It is not a well documented symptom of depression but it is probably more common than people think because of the ease with which people can just order things from the internet.'

He said James was much-missed by his two older half-sisters from his father's previous marriage and his three nieces and his nephew.

Dr Loveday concluded he was 'acutely suicidal' and asked Bristol Intensive Team to visit him within four hours.

But the mental health workers were content to speak to the 19-year-old and his mother on the phone and arrange future meetings.

He was prescribed antidepressants and referred a number of emergency mental health workers, including nurse Ciaran Purceil.

Mr Purceil said the teen's money worries were a primary contributor to his low mood - along with the problematic relationship with his mum and the death of his father Peter from a blood clot in 2008.

He told the inquest: 'I referred to his response to difficult situations, for example having to repay the significant sum of money.

'In that situation his initial response had been the only way out of this would be ending my life.

'I would say it was one of the key concerns.'

On the night of his death Mr Hammonds had been out in Bristol with friends Sunil Pandya and Charlie Cooper.

The trio parted ways at around 2am on June 29. CCTV caught Mr Hammonds stumbling close to a bridge before he jumped half an hour after leaving his friends.

His mother - who had been working a night shift - was woken at 1pm the next day by friends worried about messages her son had posted on Facebook.

Ms Hammonds told the inquest: 'They were words to the effect of "I don't want anyone to feel responsible for what I have done" and "I just want to go to sleep for a long time".'

Ms Hammonds reported her son missing and his body was discovered on July 4.

Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a verdict of death by suicide due to multiple injuries.

He said: 'I put it to Dr Sterling [a senior mental health nurse] there were a number of stresses in his life.

'She identified particularly her concerns of his use of alcohol and the - I think significant - issue in relation to the loss of money from his mother's account.

'I consider that loss of money played a significant impact on him. The express concern of how that money was to be repaid.'

He added: 'I consider that James did take a deliberate act.

'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that James knew what he was doing and understood the action he took and moreover knew the consequences of this action would be his death.'

During the inquest James' family questioned the number of different health workers he saw - at least four different people - and a confusion over who his key worker was.

They also criticised the fact James was assessed on the phone by the mental health team despite the fact his doctor had requested a visit within four hours.

They suggested a system should be put in place to check patients have enrolled on the voluntary help programmes.

But Dr Harrowing said the phone call assessment was 'appropriate in this case' and that James' care was 'not compromised as a consequence' of the confusion over his key worker.

His half-sister Jenny Hammonds said her brother had first been prescribed anti-depressants some months prior to his death, but had stopped taking his medication without seeking medical advice.

She said: 'James went on to antidepressants after self-harming and having suicidal thoughts he thought he could cope without them and said they made him feel numb.

'He only told us this when he reached crisis point, we did not know he had come off his medication at the time.

'James was very good at hiding his feelings and wanted to appear as if everything was okay. He came off them in April without a doctors advice.

'He then had a relapse of his depression and this was a major contributing factor to his suicide. He started the antidepressants again a week before the suicide, this can heighten your energy for a short period and the risk of suicide can increase before the antidepressants really start working.

'I think it's important to raise awareness of these issues in order to help others in James's position. You shouldn't come off antidepressants abruptly without medical opinion, it can cause a severe relapse.

'James had been suffering from depression for a long time and this was the real issue, the spending addiction was just a symptom of this,

'James was the loveliest, kindest, most gentle and caring person you could ever wish to meet and I wish I had known how to help him.'
