It was the hilarious parenting test highlighting the high and lows of motherhood that took the internet by storm after being reposted on countless mothering blogs.

The 14 candid questions struck a chord with women everywhere, and ended up with the blog post - then attributed to an anonymous author - clocking up millions of hits worldwide.

But now FEMAIL can reveal that the post that had mothers worldwide questioning whether they were truly ready for parenthood was actually written by a father.

The Test For Future Parents by author Colin Falconer comprises 14 steps to follow before you have children and was originally printed in his book 'A beginners guide to fatherhood' in 1992  - long before the parenting blogs it ended up on were even invented.

Are you ready: Thing you're ready for parenthood? Read these hilarious steps by Colin Falconer

'I wrote the steps originally for a column for the Australian Women's Weekly, Australia's biggest selling women's magazine back 20 years ago when my daughters were still little.

'It later became part of my book, which was essentially a collection of those pieces, as they proved so popular.

'The book was also very popular, and I did a national book tour for it and appeared on the Ray Martin show which was Australia's biggest daytime chat show at the time.

'But then my career as a fiction novelist took off and I stopped writing humour to concentrate on my career as a novelist,' Colin said.

Revealed: The man behind the hilarious steps taking mummy blogs by storm

Colin has a wealth of experience when it comes to parenting after working from home when his two daughters were 
growing up because he became a full time writer.

'It allowed me to be a part of their childhood more 
than many other working dads who don't work from home. In that respect I
consider myself very lucky,' he said.

But what do his two bundles of joy, now young women, think of the book based on their childhood?

'I dedicated the book to them and kept a copy for them both. 
But then last year they asked me about it and wanted to send copies to 
their friends and boyfriends - which is why I decided to make it 
available again online as a Kindle.'

'I'd have to add that I have the best two daughters in the world, they 
both live and work in London now, and despite all the terrible advice 
and disastrous mistakes described in the book, they have grown into the 
most extraordinary women you will ever meet.

'One is studying literature 
and creative writing and the other is general manager of an inner London
pub chain so they are not just chips off the old block, they are half a
block each.'

On top of his hilarious fourteen steps for parenthood, Colin added: 'I bumbled my way through fatherhood. Best tip of all; get a wife who's a brilliant mother and will seamlessly cover all your mistakes!'

If you think you are ready to embrace the joys of parenthood, we have printed Colin's 14 tests here to see if you are really up to the challenge...
