Secret stockpiles of chemical weapons have been found in Libya – revealing Colonel Gaddafi duped Tony Blair when he promised to give them up.

David Cameron said last night that the new Libyan government had told him it had identified an arsenal that had been ‘kept hidden from the world’.

Diplomatic sources said several sites thought to contain mustard gas agent and other chemicals had been discovered across the country and were now under armed guard.

Cosying up: Tony Blair with Colonel Gaddafi in 2007. The pair forged close links

If confirmed by international inspectors, the discovery will mean that Britain was mistaken when it cosied up to the Libyan regime on the understanding that it had given up its weapons of mass destruction.

Closer ties between the countries were agreed when Mr Blair shook hands with Gaddafi in a tent outside Tripoli in the ‘deal in the desert’ in 2004.

Mr Blair insisted at the weekend that he was not embarrassed to have forged links with Gaddafi. He said: ‘We were used to him being a threat, sponsoring terrorism. He was developing a nuclear and chemical programme. He gave it all up.'

But last night Mr Cameron, at the annual Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London, said: ‘Although Gaddafi agreed to declare and dismantle all his weapons of mass destruction… in the last few days, we have learned that the new Libyan authorities have found chemical weapons that were kept hidden from the world.’

Broken promises: When Libya joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2004, it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them

This has prompted serious security 
concerns given the political instability in Libya following Gaddafi’s 
downfall. Britain is thought to be observing the sites closely using 
satellite technology.

A source said: ‘It seems Gaddafi had 
been lying to the world about what he had and what he was doing with it.
This is stuff that Gaddafi did not declare.

‘We are still waiting for confirmation about exactly what it is, but Gaddafi’s interest was in mustard gas. What we have said to the NTC [Libya’s National Transitional Council] is that it is critically important that this material is not moved, and that it is kept secure.’

When Libya joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2004, it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them by internationally agreed deadlines.

Hidden: David Cameron said the new Libyan government had found an arsenal

Gaddafi declared 25 tonnes of bulk 
mustard agent and 1,400 tonnes of ‘precursor chemicals’ which are used 
to make chemical weapons.

He also declared more than 3,500 unfilled 
aerial bombs designed for use with chemical warfare agents such as 
sulphur mustard, and three chemical weapons production facilities.

By
February this year, Libya said it had destroyed 55 per cent of its 
declared stockpile of sulphur mustard.

The Organisation for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has already deployed an inspection team 
to Libya to evaluate the status of chemical weapons stored at the 
Ruwagha depot in the south-east of the country.

But the new Libyan authorities have advised the OPCW that ‘further stocks’ have been found.

A spokesman for the OPCW said: ‘In accordance with the Convention, Libya will provide the OPCW with a new declaration in the very near future. The OPCW will continue to work with the Libyan authorities to verify and destroy any newly declared stocks.’

In last night’s speech, Mr Cameron rounded on critics who suggested Britain’s mission in Libya would ‘only end in failure’.

‘Some said we couldn’t win because they said Britain didn’t have the military might any more,’ he said. ‘Well, to those who predicted failure, look at what we have achieved.

‘We saved civilian lives as Gaddafi’s tanks bore down on Benghazi. We helped the Libyan people to liberate themselves. I would argue that our action helped keep the Arab Spring alive. Some will look at Libya and ask “is this a new British doctrine for intervention? Next time, will we just charge in regardless?”

‘My answer is “no.” Look at the reasons for the success of the Libya campaign. We set limited goals and stuck to them. We worked with allies. We had the support of the people.’
