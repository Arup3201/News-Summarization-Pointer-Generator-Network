A woman who forged her dying partner's will in an attempt to cheat his family out of £15,000 was caught when his belongings were spotted for sale on eBay.

Ingrid Lee, 57, had told Terence Powell's children that he had not left a will when he died of cancer aged 57, but later claimed he had bequeathed his entire estate to her.

They became suspicious when they spotted his belongings being sold online, and when they asked for a formal reading of the will discovered that Mr Powell's signature had been forged.

In the weeks before Mr Powell died, Lee had even persuaded her ex-husband Christopher, 62, to help with the fakery - convincing him to provide two witnesses and an executor for the will which would have given her a potential £15,000. 

Both Lee and her former husband admitted one charge of forgery on what would have been the first day of their trial at Worcester Crown Court yesterday, but were spared an immediate prison term.

She was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for two years while Christopher, of Handsworth, Birmingham, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

They were both ordered to pay court costs of £1,400 each within 12 months.

Recorder Andrew Mainds said: 'It is quite clear Ingrid Lee had loved Mr Powell and had contributed a great deal to a relationship ended by his tragic death and decided she wanted some recompense.'

The court heard Mr Powell, from Worcester, ran a car refurbishment business when he met Lee in 2003 following her 'acrimonious divorce' from  husband Christopher.

Lee had even persuaded her ex-husband Christopher, 62, (left) to help with the fakery - convincing him to provide two witnesses and an executor for the will which would have given her a potential £15,000

The couple bought a £700,000 mock-Spanish house in Worcester which they fitted out with jacuzzis as well as splashing out on a canal boat and a fleet of luxury cars.

And when he was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2009 she took over the management of the business as well as caring for him.

After he died on December 14, 2010, she initially told his grown-up children he had not made a will but later changed her story and claimed Mr Powell left his estate to her.

Prosecutor Charles Hamer told the court: 'Ingrid Lee had been with Mr Powell for five or six years up to his death and had put up the money from a previous inheritance into buying a £700,000 property.

'The terms of the purchase meant she did not get its full value upon his death.

'She had also put cash into his car-refurbishing business but it was close to collapse and the staff, including two of his children were not being paid.

'That was the motive for her to falsify the will.' 

Mr Powell's sons Simon, 35, Aaron, 37 and daughter Victoria, 24, became suspicious and asked for a formal reading of the will to take place in a solicitor's office.

Mr Hamer told the court the document 'looked like something downloaded from the internet, which is was.'

The police were called in and handwriting expert revealed Mr Powell's signature had been forged, probably by Lee, the court heard.

Harpreet Sandhu, defending Lee, said: 'She found herself dealing with Mr Powell's failing health from cancer as well as his failing business interests.

'Through his relationship with her, he was able to lead a life that would otherwise not have been available to him.

'Over the course of six years, she lost everything because she indulged him.'

The court heard Lee was now penniless and was paying off her mortgage at a rate of just £1 a month.

Andrew Baker, defending Christopher Lee, said: 'Heaven alone knows why he became involved.

'He had an acrimonious divorce and his relationship with Mr Powell was very difficult, there could be no financial gain for him.'

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Powell's son Simon, 35, from Kidderminster, said he believed his father had been the victim of an elaborate con.

He said: 'My father is turning in his grave. He was a strong man, and didn't put up with nonsense.

'He was taken advantage of, and I feel he was trying to tell us, but we thought his condition was whey he was being oddly behaved.

'He told me he had made a will in 2007 or 2008 and that everyone would be looked after. I now think he may have believed he had made a will but nothing has ever been found.

A friend of Simon Powell spotted an old red telephone box for sale on eBay, and suspected it might have belonged to his father

'I feel my father was duped. The court case only heard Ingrid's side of the story. The truth is, my father was a successful businessman.

'He and Ingrid ran the business together and made a lot of money. They bought a beautiful £700,000 house with jacuzzi rooms and Spanish-style tiles.

'It was huge. The also went on lavish holidays together and enjoyed the good life. When my dad died I believed that his estate would come to his children but Ingrid took the lot.

'At first she told us there was no will and then she said there was one but it was obviously a fake. It left all his possessions, including the house and business, to her.

'It just didn't ring true and when we got the signature analysed it was proved to be a forgery.

'In court Ingrid admitted she would have stood to gain £15,000 but I am convinced it was closer to £1million when you take into account the business, the house and my father's investments.

The family's suspicions were confirmed when they spotted their father's belongings being sold on the internet.

Mr Powell, an engineer and father-of-one, added: 'A friend of mine told me he saw an old red telephone box for sale on eBay and thought it looked familiar.

'When I looked at it I noticed it was the one which my father had bought and had at his home.

'I started seeing lovely dining tables, lawn mowers and DJ equipment which my dad owned also being sold.

'Ingrid was basically stripping the house of my father's valuables just weeks after he died. I couldn't believe it and we called the police.

'My nan in her 80s has been traumatised and the whole family can't believe it. It's like a story out of a soap.

'Ingrid has shown no remorse. Effectively she has done the opposite. She said to me by text once that I should 'grow up and respect my father's wishes.'

'She emotionally tried to control me and says things like my father never loved us and he wasn't happy with us. What a way to lose my father, with the thoughts she put in my head like that.

'So in all we ended up with a Jaguar, a Mini and some jewellery. Effectively it amounts to little between the three of us, perhaps a few thousand pounds each.

'The sentence is not an issue to me really, maybe we, the family, wanted her to be in jail.

'The fact that she had admitted it, and has to live with it is okay for me..

'For everyone else to know what she has done, and what kind of a person she really is. All we wanted was the truth.'
