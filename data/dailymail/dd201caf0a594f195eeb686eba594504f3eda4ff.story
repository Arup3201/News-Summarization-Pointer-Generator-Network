It was a fortune built up from a lifetime a films, her marriage to screen legend Humphrey Bogart, an esteemed art collection and the $9 million apartment she treasured on New York's Upper West Side.

And almost all of the Lauren Bacall's $26.6 million estate will be split amongst her three children.

However the Oscar-winning actress - who died of a stroke aged 89 on August 12 - was careful to make sure her beloved dog, Sophie, would be well looked after.

The first item of her will - filed in a rush order at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court on Friday, according to Page Six - left $10,000 to her son, Sam Robards, to take care of the spaniel.

Her wealth will be shared evenly among New York-based Robards and his half-siblings Stephen Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Bogart.

A sum of $15,000 was left to Isla Hernandez, who worked as the former model's maid for the last 14 years.

'It’s wonderful - I never thought she would do something for me,' Hernandez, a Honduran immigrant, told The New York Post on Friday.

Another staffer, Maria Santos, was left $20,000.

While her art will be auctioned off this fall, Bacall was sure to stress that her family keep some of her items private.

'I request that my children respect my wish to keep private certain personal letters, writings, diaries and other papers or memorabilia,' Bacall wrote in the will.

Page Six said the will was 10 pages long and written last September.

A decent part of Bacall's money is tied up in her apartment at The Dakota on Central Park West, which is worth $9 million.

She has lived there since marrying Jason Robards in 1961.

Bacall first married Humphrey Bogart in 1945, at the age of 20.

Together they had a son, Sam, 53, who is also an actor.
