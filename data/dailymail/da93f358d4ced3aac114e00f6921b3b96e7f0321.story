Security guard Gary Allibon was killed in 2010 by a group involved in an armed robbery

Police investigating the fatal shooting of a security guard in Sydney four years ago say they know who was responsible and they are close to making an arrest.

Gary Allibon, a 59-year-old security guard, was shot in the back during the armed robbery of a cash delivery van in the Sydney CBD on June 7, 2010.

Today, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the crime, detectives from the Robbery and Serious Crime Squad's Strike Force Lorimer have announced they have made a number of important breakthroughs in the case.

'We believe we know who is responsible for this offence and we are very close to being able to charge those people with the offence,' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore told a press conference.

Police have been able to forensically link a vehicle used in the shooting of Mr Allibon – a stolen Audie S8 sedan – and the non-fatal shooting of a man in Wentworthville in April 2009.

They have also identified another two cars that were involved in the crime, a white BMW X5, which has not yet been located, and a silver 2004 BMW 5-Series sedan, which was stolen during a violent car-jacking in Maroubra in July 2009.

The breakthroughs were the result of scientific and technological advances and information provided to police by members of the public since 2010.

An emotional Monica Allibon spoke at a press conference about her sadness since her husband's death in 2010.

'I thought at four o'clock [this morning] when I woke up – four years ago I was happy, four years ago today I was happy,' she said.

Mrs Allibon revealed that she met Gary, whom she described as 'a really nice guy' just six months after her previous partner had died, and they 'just gelled'.

'My husband was killed by someone who can only be described as a cold-blooded murderer,' she said.

Mrs Allibon said that today was a particularly sad day in the lead up to the anniversary of Gary's death, which she will be marking tomorrow by having a mass said and then going to brunch with family.

'The murder of someone you love changes your life forever. I feel as empty today as I did the day of his death.'

She added that there is never a day that goes past that she does not think of her husband and said that every time she sees a news report about a murder she is forced to relive her own loss.

Detective Superintendent Moore said they still needed 'little pieces of information' before they could arrest the suspects and he called on the public to report any information they had about the crime to police so they could 'give Monica and her family the answers they deserve for the senseless death of Gary Allibon.'

The crime occurred when Mr Allibon and another security guard were confronted by a group of armed men when they entered the foyer of a building on Sussex Street.

Mr Allibon was shot in the back and the group stole some cash form the guards and fled in the silver Audi S8 sedan.

Mr Allibon was treated at the scene before he was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital but died later.

Detective Superintendent Moore called those involved in the crime 'well-organised' and 'cold-blooded' and said they were suspected of having links to known organised crime groups.

Mr Allibon's widow, Monica, also addressed the press conference. She said she was happy with the progress police had made.

She added that things had been 'difficult' and she was constantly reminded of her husband's death.

Mrs Allibon added that knowing police were close to being able to arrest those responsible for her husband's death 'doesn't change my life, but it makes some difference to know that some justice has been served.'
