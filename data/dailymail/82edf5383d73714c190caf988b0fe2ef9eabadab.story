Wayne Rooney has admitted he watched Manchester United's latest superstar signing Radamel Falcao in action on YouTube before his deadline day move to Old Trafford.

The Manchester United captain is a keen admirer of the Colombian forward and said he used the global video-sharing website to see a collection of the 28-year-old's career goals.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'Yes, I've YouTubed his goals of course. But I have seen him play throughout the years for Atletico Madrid. It is exciting for us at United and also for the Premier League that he has signed.

'Falcao is a world-class player and one who could have gone to a number of other clubs so it's great we've got him.

'I just hope he hasn't picked up any little injuries while he has been away with Colombia. It's a great signing but it's also a great ­statement of intent from the club.' 

Rooney conceded that while last season was unacceptable he remains hopeful the glory days will now return to Old Trafford sooner rather than later.

He added: 'Obviously last season, we all know we were not good enough. But the time is now right to get these top players to get us back to where we belong – winning titles again.'
