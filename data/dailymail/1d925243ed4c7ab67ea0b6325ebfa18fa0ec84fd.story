Before finding money and fame as a professional footballer, Alexis Sanchez grew up in the poor mining town of Tocopilla, Chile, where he discovered his talents kicking a ball along the dusty streets as a boy.

Speaking in an interview with The Times, the 25-year-old reflected on his fondness for his hometown and how every year the local authorities would dish out Christmas gifts from the back of a pick-up truck - a tradition held in Tocopilla for as long as he can remember.

'It was people from the council on the truck... I said to myself when I was young that one day, if I ever had the chance, I would do the same, but instead of sweets, I would throw footballs.'

Alexis Sanchez has scored 14 goals in 22 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal this season

Sanchez has said he is enjoying life in north London and has become a firm fan favourite at the Emirates

Despite a rapid rise to fame for the skillful 25-year-old, Sanchez remains level-headed in his approach 

Despite making a fortune in European football, coming from such humble beginnings has kept the Arsenal and Chile star's feet firmly on the ground following his £30million move to the Gunners.

'In my head I do not feel like a famous person. I am just normal, no different to someone in the street. I am just a kid who happens to play football. 

'When I play I don't think about how much I cost. I just try to enjoy myself like it's the first match I ever played.

Moving away from his home in Chile the forward has had spells with Udinese and Spanish giants Barcelona

'When I was younger, I played football on the streets, on a scrap of land, wherever I could. I had to apologise to the neighbours a few times for breaking windows, like all kids. Quite a few times actually!

'We did not have a pitch or anything like that. We would put down two rocks and that was the goal. 

'It did not bother me no to have proper boots or a good pitch. It was enough to be with my friends and playing. It's no different now... I just love playing.' 

Sanchez's start to life in the Premier League has seen him net nine times for the Gunners, making him the third top goalscorer in the top flight. 

He'll be looking to add to his tally as Arsenal continue to scrap for a place in the top four when his side travel to Stoke on Saturday,
