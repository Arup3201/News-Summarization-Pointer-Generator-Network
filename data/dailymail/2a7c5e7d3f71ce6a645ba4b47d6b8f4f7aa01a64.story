Margaret Holt, 65, who vanished three years ago after leaving her hotel at a resort in Lanzarote. A skeleton has been found by a fisherman at the base of a cliff

A skeleton found by a Spanish fisherman is believed to be that of a missing British woman who vanished while on holiday in Lanzarote three years ago.

Margaret Holt, 65, left her hotel in the resort of Costa Teguise two days before Christmas in 2011 to go hiking.

But she was never seen again and despite a two week search of the island no trace of the mother from Wirral, Merseyside, was found.

The discovery of bones was made by a fisherman at a remote spot at the base of a cliff at the Canary island's northern peninsula.

It took firemen more than three hours to recover the remains because the area is difficult to reach.

The paramilitary Civil Guard have ordered forensic tests on the bones to establish if they belong to Mrs Holt.

An autopsy is expected to be carried out but it is believed Mrs Holt was killed by an accidental fall.

The family of Mrs Holt contacted the Spanish Civil Guard to raise the alarm after she failed to make contact with them over Christmas.

It is believed Ms Holt, who is described as seasoned hiker who would often trek 20 miles a day, was holidaying alone when she went for a walk from her hotel in the Costa Teguise.

Posters and searches along rugged coastal paths failed to turn up any information on Ms Holt.

Authorities say she was spotted later in the afternoon of  the day  she disappeared in the northerly Ã“rzola region of the island but had not been seen since.
