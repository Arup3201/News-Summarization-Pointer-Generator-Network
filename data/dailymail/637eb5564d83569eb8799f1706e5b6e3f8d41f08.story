A Los Angeles marketing firm is calling Alex from Target a fake. And they say they're responsible.

Breakr, a company dedicated to 'connecting fans to their fandom' announced Tuesday that they'd orchestrated the meme's massive viral popularity.

The news was a sharp blow to many teenage Alex from Target lovers, but do they truly have a reason to be upset?

Is this man responsible for Alex from Target? Dil-Domine Jacobe Leonares (right) is CEO of marketing startup Breakr and says his firm is behind the viral meme

Breakr CEO Dil-Domine Jacobe Leonares wrote in a LinkedIn post about his company's involvement:

'Yesterday, we had fun on Twitter with the hashtag #AlexFromTarget which ended up to be one of the most amazing social media experiments ever,' he wrote Monday. 'We wanted to see how powerful the fangirl demographic was.'

The result was one of the most popular, overnight viral memes ever. On Monday alone, Alex from Target was tweeted about some 1 million times.

Alex turned out to be a random, handsome Texas teenage Target employee named Alex Laboeuf.  

By Tuesday, Laboeuf's Twitter followers numbered around 500,000 and his good fortune continues to pour forth.

Ellen Degeneres tweeted a photo of herself along with Alex and the hashtag #AlexFromTargetAtTargetWithEllen. 

In addition to internet stardom, it appears Alex may have won himself a spot on a holiday Target commercial. 

But was it Breakr who got him there, or are they just looking to profit from the Alex phenomenon?

From the start of the Alex from Target craze, everyone appears to agree it was a British Twitter user named Abbie who first tweeted Alex's photo.

Not so fast: The undisputed first person to tweet the photo was this British girl -- she says she's never heard of Breakr

First saw Alex? Texas teen Alanna Page (left) first tweeted about Alex after seeing him at Target in late October. Her friend Brooklyn then responded with the now-infamous pic of Alex after seeing him for herself and a meme was born

So how did a girl in England hook up with a California marketing startup with a handful of employees and an app on the iTunes store boasting all of 30 reviews?

She didn't. Abbie herself says she has no idea who they are.

'i dont work for breakr wtf i dont even know what it is,' she tweeted.

She also shared on Tuesday evening some of her not-so-positive feelings about the craze.

'whatever im so done with this alex s***' she tweeted.

What's more, as the Daily Dot reports, Abbie wasn't the photographer--it was more likely a girl named Brooklyn Reiff, who recognized Alex while in line at Target from a tweet her friend had sent previously.

'Alanna tweeted about a checkout guy at target being attractive & I soon found myself in his checkout line.. remembering Alanna's tweet,' Reiff told the Daily Dot. 'I quickly snapped a pic of 'Alex from Target' and tweeted Alanna.'

Neither Reiff nor Alanna Page have had any connections to -- or even heard of Breakr -- either.

'I have never heard of Breakr but a few of my friends are sending me links to the post but I don't really know what it is,' Reiff added.
