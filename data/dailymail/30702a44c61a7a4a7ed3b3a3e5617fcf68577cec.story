Sami Khedira has confirmed he will leave Real Madrid in the summer after five years at the Bernabeu, but insists he is yet to reach an agreement with another club.

The German midfielder's contract expires at the end of June and he won't be short of suitors with Arsenal, Schalke and Bayern Munich all showing an interest.

Khedira, who has made over 100 La Liga appearances for Los Blancos, revealed that he will seek pastures new at the end of the current campaign.

The 27-year-old told Kicker: 'I don’t have an agreement with any club nor any preferences as to who I would like to join'.

'It’s not a decision against Real Madrid. I want to find new challenges for my career and continue to grow as a player.'

Khedira has come in for heavy criticism this season and has lost his place in midfield to Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, while young Brazilian Lucas Silva was signed in January.

The former Stuttgart man hasn't featured since the disappointing Champions League defeat by Schalke, when he was the subject of abuse from fans after the game.
