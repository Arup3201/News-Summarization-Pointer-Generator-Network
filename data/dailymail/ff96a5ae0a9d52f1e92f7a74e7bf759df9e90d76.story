David Cameron wants select committees to investigate whether The Guardian broke the law by printing information leaked by Edward Snowden

David Cameron backed calls for a full parliamentary inquiry into whether the Guardian’s publication of leaked national secrets has put state security at risk.

The Prime Minister encouraged MPs on select committees to investigate whether the paper had broken the law or done harm to our security by printing information leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.

And yesterday the chairman of one of them, Keith Vaz, said his home affairs committee would be investigating the Guardian’s conduct.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox accused the Guardian of ‘reckless and politically dangerous’ behaviour which may have made Britain more vulnerable to attack.

And last night, pressure on the paper increased still further after Tory backbencher Julian Smith was granted a Parliamentary debate in Westminster Hall next Tuesday over the publishing of the top-secret documents.

Julian Smith, who earlier this week 
wrote to Scotland Yard urging them to conduct an inquiry into the 
Guardian, said: ‘I look forward to laying out the reasons why I believe 
that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism 
and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who 
seek to protect us.'

The Prime Minister said that in agreeing to dispose of information it had obtained from the former US National Security Agency employee, the newspaper effectively accepted its involvement in putting national security at risk. 

Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the plain fact is that what has 
happened has damaged national security, and in many ways the Guardian 
themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my 
national security adviser and Cabinet Secretary (Sir Jeremy Heywood) to 
destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.

‘So they know that what they are dealing with is dangerous for national security.’

He was responding to a question from Dr Fox, who said: ‘Can we have a full and transparent assessment about whether the Guardian’s involvement in the Snowden affair has damaged Britain’s national security?’

Mr Cameron replied: ‘I think it’s up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.’

Last week the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said the Guardian had handed a gift to terrorists.

Later in the day, Dr Fox wrote to the chairmen of five Commons select committees urging them to carry out an investigation into the Guardian’s ‘reckless and potentially dangerous’ conduct.The letter was sent to Keith Vaz of the home affairs committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind (intelligence and security), John Arbuthnot (defence), Richard Ottaway (foreign affairs) and Sir Alan Beith, chairman of the liaison select committee.

He wrote: ‘A free press does not mean the freedom to make the UK, its people or its allies more vulnerable to serious organised crime or terrorism.

‘I am writing to formally request, as both a Member of Parliament and a former Security of State for Defence, that your committee considers the elements of the Guardian’s involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks.

David Cameron said the publication had 'damaged national security' and Liam Fox (right) has written to the chairmen of five select committees to ask them to investigate

‘I would like you to determine whether the vulnerability of the people of Britain, our security services or those of our allies have been impaired by what I believe to be reckless and potentially dangerous behaviour.’

Last week the head of MI5 , Andrew Parker, said the publication of the stolen top-secret documents had handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services.

Security officials say the exposé amounts to a ‘guide book’, advising terrorists on the best way to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also criticised the paper, saying technical details about the operations of spies should not be published in newspapers.

But his Liberal Democrat colleague Business Secretary Vince Cable expressed concerns about the level of scrutiny the newspaper was now facing, saying it had performed ‘a very considerable public service’.
