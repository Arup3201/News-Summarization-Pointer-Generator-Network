Postman: Paul Buswell, of Barwell, Leicestershire, admitted to using sex lines in the past

A postman has admitted making a phone call to a live sex line from a customer’s house while in the middle of his morning rounds.

Paul Buswell, 38, of Barwell, Leicestershire, let himself into a house in the nearby village of Elmesthorpe to use a landline to make the call to an 0909 premium line.

The householder had realised something was wrong when she noticed her home phone was missing from the handset, Hinckley Magistrates’ Court was told.

Liz Dodds, prosecuting, said: ‘At around 9.50am the complainant saw an answerphone message waiting to be heard. She listened to it and then went out to the greenhouse to her husband.

‘On returning she noticed the defendant walking up the drive away from the house.’

The householder then noticed the phone handset which had been present a moment before was no longer there.

Attempts were made to find the phone and it was eventually discovered outside the front of the house. The couple dialled the last number called and were shocked to find it was a live sex line.

Enquiries into phone records showed a three minute call had been made between 9.54am and 9.57am on the landline - the exact time the couple had been speaking in the greenhouse.

Ms Dodds told the court: ‘It is fair to say that the defendant was attending the address in his capacity as a postman.

‘Previously he has been given implied permission to enter the address in his capacity as a postman to place parcels inside. He has extended his right to enter the address and used the landline in the way the court has heard.’

Buswell, who has worked as a postman for Royal Mail for 15 years, initially denied the offence when interviewed.

He admitted to using sex lines in the past - but stated he had stopped calling them between June and July last year. However, phone records indicated otherwise.

When appearing before Hinckley magistrates this week, Buswell pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation this week in relation to the incident that took place on September 10 last year.

'He has made a foolish mistake that he has admitted to. He says he is unable to explain his actions in this incident'

Chris Black, defending, said: ‘Mr Buswell is a person of good character. He has made a foolish mistake that he has admitted to. He says he is unable to explain his actions in this incident.’

Sentencing for the case was postponed until July 22, after the probation service requested a three-week adjournment in order to provide a full report. Buswell was remanded on unconditional bail.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘Royal Mail does not comment on individual court cases. We are carrying out an internal investigation into this matter.’
