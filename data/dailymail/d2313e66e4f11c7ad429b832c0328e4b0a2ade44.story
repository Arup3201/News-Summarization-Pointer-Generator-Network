Migration Watch UK: 'These figures lay bare the legacy of the Labour government'

Number of Poles living in the UK has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year

Migration added 239,000 to Britain’s population last year – because immigration remained sky-high while Britons can no longer afford to leave the country to live abroad.

The figure is more than a fifth higher than in 2009 and the second biggest annual total ever.

The increase came despite Coalition promises to curb immigration. The number of immigrants – 575,000 last year – has run at a similar level for the past seven years.

Fewer Britons are emigrating because falling incomes and pensions mean hundreds of thousands have abandoned the dream of retirement or a new life in France, Spain, Australia or the U.S.

The recession has also reduced the number of Britons able to take jobs elsewhere in the world. Emigration fell by more than a fifth in two years after the recession began in 2008.

The figures also showed that Polish and other Eastern European workers are no longer heading home because of the impact of the recession but are now coming back to Britain in large numbers.

Last year 71,000 people from Poland and other Eastern European countries came to Britain, up from 52,000 the year before. Only 31,000 Eastern Europeans emigrated from Britain compared with 47,000 in 2009.

The figures released yesterday by the Office for National Statistics reignited the political row over migration.

Labour accused ministers of dishonesty over the pledges to reduce the impact of immigration on the population, while the Government said net migration – the numbers added to the population by migration – had begun to level off after the unprecedented mass migration of Labour’s years in power.

The new estimates mean the day when the country’s population hits 70million, the symbolic figure which a Labour minister once declared would never be reached, has come even closer.

At this rate a 70million population will be reached in 2025 – four years earlier than the officially-projected date of 2029.

The Coalition has introduced schemes to cut the number of work permits given to migrants from outside Europe and drawn up a scheme to reduce numbers of foreign students.

Immigration minister Damian Green said yesterday: ‘In various sectors, this country has become addicted to immigration, and, like weaning anyone off an addiction, it requires time, it requires patience and perseverance.

‘We need a better balanced immigration system and we need lower immigration. We also need a better-skilled workforce.’

Mr Green said the Government would not lower its targets for slashing immigration levels. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: ‘It’s very important we get immigration at a sustainable level, not just for our economy but for the wider health of society.

‘If people have confidence in the immigration system, then some of the social stresses and strains we have seen in recent years go away.’

The 239,000 figure has been surpassed only once – in 2004, the year Britain’s doors were opened to workers from Poland and Eastern Europe under EU rules, when net migration reached 245,000.

Sir Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘These figures lay bare the legacy of the Labour government.’

Matt Cavanagh, associate director of 
the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank, slammed the figures, 
saying: 'Politicians shouldn't promise what they can't deliver, 
particularly on immigration.

'Before
 the election, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said immigration was 
out of control; afterwards, they said they would cut it dramatically. 
Neither was true.

'Today's 
figures reinforce how stable immigration has been both before and after 
the election: the ONS estimate non-British immigration for 2010 at 
455,000, compared to 437,000 in 2009 - and broadly stable since 2006.

'Emigration
 has continued to fall, down over 20 per cent since 2008, meaning that 
"net inward migration", the Conservatives' chosen target, remains high 
at 239,000, a 21 per cent increase on 2009.'

The number of Polish people living in the UK has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year, other ONS figures released today showed.

Net migration from the so-called A8 countries which are eight of the ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004, - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - rose almost eight-fold last year to 39,000 from 5,000 in 2009, the ONS figures showed.

Around two in three of all A8 citizens who have migrated to the UK have been Polish, the figures showed.

The figures also showed the number of Poles working in the UK between April and June this year reached 449,888, up 15 per cent from January to March.

More than four in five Poles aged 16 to 64 were employed, compared with just seven in 10 of the UK population as a whole, during the second quarter of 2011.

Other ONS figures showed births to mothers born outside the UK accounted for one in four of all live births in the UK last year.

Poland became the most common country of origin for non-UK born mothers, while for fathers it was Pakistan.

The figures released today also 
showed the number of people granted settlement - known as 'indefinite 
leave to remain' and requires a good knowledge of language and life in 
the UK - reached a record 241,000 last year.

This number included those already living in the country, as well as those applying in the last year.

Settlement is decided on a case by 
case basis, depending on a variety of factors including the applicant's 
employment status, whether they are refugees or if they already have 
family living the UK.

The high settlement figure was partly attributed to the number 
of people being allowed to stay as the backlog of asylum cases was 
cleared, other figures published by the Home Office showed.

Long-term immigration was 575,000, 
similar to the levels seen since 2004, while long-term emigration fell 
to 336,000 from 427,000 in 2008, estimates from the Office for National 
Statistics (ONS) showed.

Study remained the most common reason
 for those coming to the UK, with three in four of the 228,000 overseas 
students who come to the UK to learn coming from outside the EU.

But the number of people heading to the UK's shores for a definite job was at its lowest in more than six years, at 110,000.

And
 the amount of those leaving the UK for work-related reasons was at its 
lowest for three years at 179,000, the ONS estimates showed.

Work-related
 grants of settlement also reached a record last year of 84,000, 
reflecting high numbers admitted for work five years earlier.

But figures for the first half of this year showed an 8 per cent fall in the number of people being granted settlement, down to 208,000, with falls in both the work and family categories.

A total of 195,000 people were granted British citizenship last year, down from the record high of 204,000 in 2009 but more than double the level of a decade earlier.

The number of people applying for asylum also fell in 2010, but has started to rise again this year with 4,800 applications between April and June.

This is up 9 per cent from the same quarter in 2010, mainly due to an increase in applications from war-torn Pakistan and Libya, the figures showed.

The number of people being removed or leaving the UK voluntarily fell to a record low between April and June this year, the Home Office figures showed.

Just 11,388 people were removed or left voluntarily, the lowest quarterly figure since such data became available in 2001.

It came as an audit showed the huge costs the last government spent on asylum claims.

Labour spent £2million every day on a shambolic asylum system which failed to remove hundreds of thousands of bogus claimants, revealed a study by the MigrationWatch think-tank.

The audit showed how officials spent as much as £10billion processing applications as they struggled to cope with a surge in numbers.

But only one in four of the 660,000 decisions made on asylum claims between 1997 and 2010 led to the applicant being removed.
