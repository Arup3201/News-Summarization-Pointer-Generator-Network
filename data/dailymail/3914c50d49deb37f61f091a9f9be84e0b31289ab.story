CCTV footage: The man told staff at the depot that he needed to borrow five huge metal road plates, weighing three quarters of a tonne each

A thief conned railway workers into using a forklift truck to load almost four tonnes of metal worth £3,000 into his van - because he was wearing a high-visibility jacket.

British Transport Police have launched an appeal after the man persuaded staff at the Bounds Green transport terminal in North London that he was a fellow worker.

The man, wearing a hard hat and bright yellow safety jacket, said he needed to borrow five huge metal road plates, weighing three quarters of a tonne each.

The £600 hardened metal plates, used as a heavy duty covering during temporary road and rail repairs, were loaded into the back of a white flatbed truck with a forklift at the railway depot.

Detective Constable Nick Thompson said: ‘The man entered the depot office in Bounds Green and spoke to staff, claiming to work at a neighbouring depot.

‘He asked to borrow a number of metal road plates, hardened steel plates designed to protect troughing routes where cables are laid.

‘The staff member eventually agreed to lend some plates to the man, who was wearing a high-visibility jacket.

‘The man then entered the neighbouring depot and asked for their assistance loading the plates onto a van with the use of their forklift truck.

Appeal for information: Police have released CCTV images of the man they believe responsible for the theft, which took place between 1pm and 1.45pm on January 23

‘In total, the suspect stole five road plates, each worth £600, within the space of a few minutes, loading them onto the back a white Mercedes flatbed truck.’

Police have released CCTV images of the man they believe responsible for the theft, which took place between 1pm and 1.45pm on January 23.

Det Con Thompson added: ‘This was a brazen theft by a man pretending to be a member of maintenance staff in order to steal a significant amount of metal.

‘The truck was heavily loaded when it left the yard and I am confident that someone would have seen something which can help us.

Safe Site Facilities, a company who offer road plates for sale or hire, say they are a common target for metal thieves.

A spokesman said: ‘It's fairly common for them to be stolen because they are so heavy - they're worth a lot.

‘However, decent scrap yards are now really clamping down on what they take - so we hope to not see thefts of this type in the future.’
