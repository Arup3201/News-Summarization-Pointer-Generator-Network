Superdrug has joined forces with Ann Summers to offer customers the 
opportunity to pick up their weekly toiletries and sex toys all in one place.

The brand and high street chain aim to 'meet the demands of busy, modern women who want their beauty, cosmetic and sexual needs met all at once – in one place'.

Superdrug will stock a selection of Ann Summers ‘sexcessories’ including seven of their popular Rampant Rabbit vibrators, first made famous on Sex And The City (from £49.99), vibrating bullets, Jiggle Balls, of the sort recently made popular by Fifty Shades Of Grey (£18) and the metallic Vibrating Egg (£20), as well as novelty items such as the Milk Chocolate Body Paint (£5) and Edible Lubricants (£8).

New partnership: Superdrug and Ann Summers have joined forces and will sell a range of sex toys in store

The range sits within the existing sexual health and wellbeing section of the store and is available to buy online too.

Ann Summers Brand Director, Fiona Davis said: 'We are very excited about this new business partnership with Superdrug, and the fact that customers will now be able to pick up their cosmetic essentials, as well as a little something exciting for the bedroom.

On offer: Sex toys such as vibrators, love balls and rampant rabbits will be on sale in the aisles

More toys: There will also be vibrating eggs, lubricants and body rub displayed amongst the health goods

'Following the Fifty Shades phenomenon, sex toy sales have shot through the roof – so it appears we’re all intrigued and broadening our mindset when it comes to sexual enhancement. 

'We’re delighted that our bestselling products – such as the Rampant Rabbit and our innovative range of ‘sexcessories’ – will now be accessible to a wider audience.'

Melanie Wilson, Superdrug’s Head of Health added: 'This new range will give our customers the chance to browse and buy this product category in a comfortable and convenient environment, both in store and online.' 

Outrage: Judging by the Twittersphere, people aren't impressed by the new partnership

But judging by the reaction from the Twittersphere, many customers are unimpressed by the partnership.

Kaylea Mitchem ‏wrote: 'It's AMAZING how many negative comments have sprung up with regards to Superdrug stocking Ann Summers products.'

Lauren McCartney ‏wrote: 'Still can't 
believe that Superdrug are going to stock Ann Summers products! Please 
don't bring them near my counter! #oooer'.

While Kelle Salle ‏added a more concise reaction: 'Ann Summers and Superdrug? No no no no.'

Rachel Toal said: 'Frankly, I'm 
appalled at the store's inappropriate merchandising. I'm no prude (and 
no stranger to Ann Summers) but when I pop to the chemist for nappies, I
don't expect to be asked squirm-inducing questions by my 
three-year-old.

'No mother should ever have to 
explain what "that funny rabbit" is (unless, of course, they're watching
an episode of Bugs Bunny).

'There's a time and a place for sex toy shopping - and that's at at home, minus kids, with a post-bedtime glass of wine.'

One click away: The new range is also available online with taglines such as 'serious playtime' and 'shale it baby' to advertise vibrators and lubricants

'The only battery-operated goods I expect to see at Superdrug are for cleaning my teeth - not spicing up my sex life.'

The new partnership echoes the ongoing furore surrounding Boots' decision to start stocking Durex products in stores.

The idea was first mooted in 2004 but didn't then come to fruition. Durex sex toys then made it to the shelves of Boots in 2007, but were withdrawn amid negative public reaction.

In 2012 Boots made a second attempt at introducing a Durex sex toy range but faced criticism by shoppers who felt the displays were inappropriate.

Customers complained they had to walk past the sex aids in order to shop for shampoo, deodorants, toothpaste and sandwiches.
