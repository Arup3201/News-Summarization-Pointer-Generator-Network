Manchester United's stars were out in force on Saturday night to celebrate Angel di Maria's birthday in style at the Argentinian themed Gaucho Restaurant.

The former Real Madrid winger looked relax as he arrived with family, just a few weeks prior to his house being the scene of an attempted burglary. 

He was joined by fellow United players such as Robin van Persie Marcus Rojo, David de Gea and Radamel Falcao.

His teammates also spoke highly of the talented midfielder in recent interviews with manutd.com.

Fellow Argentinian Rojo said: 'I first met Angel with Argentina's national team. He was always a cool guy. We've got along well since the first time we met. He is young and so am I, so I've always had a good relationship with him. 

'And here at United we are the only Argentinians, so we are almost always together. We're always talking, or sharing a tea [a type of tea in Argentina] or whatever. He is a great person.'

England midfielder Michael Carrick praised di Maria and likened him to United legend Ryan Giggs.

'There are players who have got tricks and can drop the shoulder to go past players, but he is so direct in his play. It is almost like Giggsy used to be in many ways. 

'When he picks that ball up he can carry it and change direction pretty quickly, so it is very tough to defend against – especially if he is doing through the middle of the park.'

Louis van Gaal's side travel to League One's Preston on Monday, knowing that they're in for a stern test if they're to progress to the next round of the FA Cup.

Having needed two ties to see off League Two's Cambridge United in the previous round, the Dutchman knows his team cannot afford to slip up against the tougher opposition. 

Despite coming under criticism in the past few weeks, United are still in good form and find themselves on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions.
