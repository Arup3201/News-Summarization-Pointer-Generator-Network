A drunk Celebrity Big Brother audience member sparked hilarity after she was spotted shouting, singing and dancing with a pineapple on camera.

Wearing a distinctive red jumpsuit, Antonia Knowles, 22, looked as though as was about to fall off her seat during filming for Channel 5's Bit on the Side after getting drunk on free wine and vodka.

The massage therapist from Windsor, Berkshire was even seen waving a pineapple in the air and sharing a joke with host Rylan Clark at one point in the show which aired on Tuesday night.

Viewers took to Twitter to rave about the 'drunk red dress girl' and by the time she headed home with friend James Stone, 23, she started to receive hundreds of messages.

The drunk audience members was seen sharing a joke with the host  who asked her 'are you alright?'

The hungover Big Brother fan woke up to more than 1,000 tweets from viewers yesterday morning and admitted: 'I'm totally mortified  - but it's worth it'.

She said: 'It's a bit embarrassing. I feel disastrous, I've got a massive headache. I can't believe I ended up trending on Twitter for being the only girl who can outshine Rylan's teeth.

'I don't know how they tracked me down on Twitter, maybe because I was favouriting all the messages about the 'drunk girl in the red dress'.

'I started getting the messages when I was on the show, but I didn't have my phone on me, so I saw them on the taxi on the way home.

'By the time I woke up in the morning I had more than 1,000.'

She received tickets to  be in the audience for the show because her friend Mr Stone was a test housemate - living in the Big Brother house before the celebrities entered.

The pair downed a few double vodkas before they got to the studio in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, and then started on the free rose wine.

Ms Knowles admitted  she couldn't remember anything after the cameras started rolling at 11pm because they had also been swigging smuggled vodka in the loos.  

'Some people take Big Brother more seriously than their own life,' she said.

Andrew Morgan Carthy said: 'That girl in the audience in the red dress on #CBBBOTS has had one too many vodka red bulls. She needs a kebab and glass of water.'

Jazz said: '#CBB did they all get free drinks tonight? The woman in the red dress is more annoying than the house mates.' 

There were even calls for Ms Knowles to be a surprise new addition to the Celebrity Big Brother house.

Kirsty tweeted: 'They should stick the girl in the red dress in the #cbb house #CBBBOTS a little friend for Perez!!'
