Animal patrol officers were forced to shoot a giant black bear with a large tranquiliser dart after spending an afternoon climbing trees.

The 300lb brown bear was spotted near a school in Ridgewood, New Jersey on Tuesday afternoon 

Animal experts tried coaxing the bear down from the tree but eventually had to shoot him with a dart 

The bear was captured in a net suspended beneath the branches and taken to a nature reserve for release

When that failed, animal control experts attempted to force him down by hosing him with water. 

The bear remained up the tree until 3pm on Tuesday when it was resting on a branch. 

While the bear was on the loose, children attending GW Middle School, Orchard Elementary and Ridge Elementary had to remain inside even after their final lessons had ended. 

Officers from the Department of Fish and Wildlife deployed nets underneath the tree's branches before shooting the bear with the knock-out dart. 

Animal control officer Carol Tyler told ABC 7 News: 'The bear is fine, he's tranquilised, we're still waiting for the chemical to take a little more effect. He's wrapped up in the net and there will be no more running today.

'He's fine, we caught him and he didn't hit the ground hard at all.'

Police warned residents to stay indoor after the spotted the large bear on Tuesday. 

Officials said the bear weighed approximately 301 pounds. 

This follows a fatal bear attack on Darsh Patel at a New Jersey nature reserve about 30 miles away from Ridgeway on September 21.

Local residents looked on with concern as the incident continued throughout Tuesday afternoon
