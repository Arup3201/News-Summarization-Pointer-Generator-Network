Pakistani security officials have found two copies of the Bible at the house where Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed.

The Christian holy books were discovered this week when demolition crews were sent in to tear down the compound in Abbottabad.

They were so well hidden that security personnel had previously overlooked them.

Hidden secrets: Pakistani security officials found two copies of the Bible at the house in Abbottabad where Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed during its demolition last week

Coded? The English-language Bibles contain pages that are folded-over and highlighted texts

It is thought the English-print editions contain coded clues to future terror attacks, The Sun reported.

Pakistan's ISI security service also found two radio sets in a final sweep of the compound before demolition.

The
English-language Bibles - a bizarre find in the home of the world's 
most famous Islamic fundamentalist - contained pages that are 
folded-over and highlighted texts.

An
ISI commanding officer told The Sun: 'The Bibles were in English and we
cannot be sure why they were there. These copies were found as we 
checked the rooms for the final time before demolishing the building.

'The
radios are in working condition and will be given with the Bibles to 
the investigators. Some pages were folded and we will see later what was
of most interest to Bin Laden.

'Maybe he was looking for teachings of jihad.'

Bin Laden was killed at the compound by U.S. Navy SEALs last May after the biggest manhunt in history.

Its demolition was completed on Sunday, erasing a symbol of humiliation for Pakistan's military that has marked one of the most difficult periods in U.S.-Pakistan ties.

The Pakistani military was angry it had not been consulted by U.S. officials before the raid took place - a decision the U.S. explained was driven by 
concerns that someone in the government might tip off Bin Laden.

While much of the world cheered the death, Pakistan fumed over what it called a violation of its sovereignty.

Why Pakistani authorities decided to demolish the structure last week is unclear.

Residents
of the normally sleepy town of Abbottabad were divided on what the 
government should do with the compound in the aftermath of the raid.

Some
thought it should be destroyed, but others believed it should be turned
into a tourist attraction to help the town earn money.

There was always the danger, however, that it could also draw Al Qaeda supporters.

American officials said they buried Bin Laden's body at sea to avoid giving his followers a burial place 
that could become a makeshift shrine.

Many
U.S. officials expressed disbelief that Bin Laden could have lived in 
Abbottabad for around six years without the Pakistani government 
knowing.

But the U.S. has not found any evidence that senior Pakistani 
officials knew of the Al Qaeda chief's whereabouts.

The
U.S. Navy SEALs who attacked bin Laden's compound infiltrated 
by helicopter from neighbouring Afghanistan.

Pakistan responded by kicking out 
more than 100 U.S. troops training Pakistanis in counter-terrorism 
operations and reduced the level of intelligence cooperation.

Some
members of Congress called on the U.S. to cut of the billions of 
dollars of military and civilian aid to Pakistan unless Islamabad 
explained Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad and boosted cooperation on 
the Afghan war. The aid has continued, although at a somewhat lower 
level.
