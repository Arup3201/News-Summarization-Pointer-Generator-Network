Nicklas Bendtner was fined £4,750 by magistrates and had six points added to his licence

Footballer Nicklas Bendtner has been ordered to pay almost £5,000 in fines after he was caught driving without a licence and insurance.

The Arsenal striker, who was on-loan to Sunderland last season, was pulled over by police in South Tyneside.

Detectives discovered the 24-year-old was not insured on his £40,000 Audi and had no driving licence.

Bendtner, who was charged with driving without the correct licence, using a vehicle without insurance and two counts of driving a vehicle with a registration plate not conforming with regulations was found guilty in his absence by magistrates at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.

He was fined £4,750 and had six points added to his licence.

The 24-year-old Danish international, who has been linked with a move to Spanish side Celta Vigo at the weekend, was also ordered to pay £85 costs.

Bendtner allegedly told police when asked why there was no insurance or proper number plates on his Audi Q7, that he had a 'friend who sorts that out for me.'

The court heard that the striker had no licence after failing to re-apply for it having receiving a 56-day driving ban for speeding in February.

Rachael Dodsworth, prosecuting, said: 'It was 6.50pm on May 13 when police stopped the defendant’s silver Audi Q7.

'There were more than two people in the car and there were no ‘L’ plates.

'There was no trace of the registration number, and there was no insurance on the car.'

The 24-year-old Danish international, who has been linked with a move to Spain, told officers he had a 'friend' who helped him to sort out his car insurance

In March, Bendtner was cleared at Newcastle Magistrates' Court after being accused of vandalising cars.

He was initially charged with five counts of criminal damage alongside Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole.

Cattermole eventually accepted conditional discharges for the £4,168.27 damage caused in the wrecking spree.

The same court banned Bendtner from driving for 56 days after he was caught driving his Porsche 911 at 103mph.

Last year, he was also involved in an incident in a Copenhagen pizzeria after his credit card was declined and he begged for someone else to pay for the takeaway. He later publicly apologized for his behaviour.
