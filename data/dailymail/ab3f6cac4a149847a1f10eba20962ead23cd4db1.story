The ashes of items taken from the Dallas apartment where the man who died from the Ebola virus first became ill will be taken to a Louisiana hazardous waste landfill for burial.

The linen, bedding and carpet taken from the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan got sick were taken to the Veolia Environmental Services incinerator in Port Arthur, where they were destroyed Friday.

Company spokesman Dan Duncan tells the Beaumont Enterprise that the ash will be analyzed for two days for any remaining contamination before it is sent to the Louisiana landfill.

Steam from cooling towers rises above the rotary kiln at Veolia Environmental Services in Port Arthur, Texas. Items from the Dallas home where Thomas Duncan took ill were incinerated here at temperatures exceeding 1,500 degrees. Still, locals were concerned about the risks

State officials say Duncan's body was cremated but aren't giving further details.

'All 142 drums were unloaded with no incident and all were destroyed by noon (Friday),' Duncan said. 

Beaumont-Port Arthur officials say they're upset that Veolia didn't advise them that potentially contaminated material was being shipped into the area for destruction. 

A group of concerned area citizens met over the weekend to voice their fears, reports 12NewsNow.

'This can't happen,' Janice Rogers said. 'It's very dangerous, lives can be impacted, people can die from this.'

'This can't happen,' Janice Rogers said. 'It's very dangerous, lives can be impacted, people can die from this.'

Company authorities called the disposal a harmless procedure.  

'We've got the capability and permits to manage it safely here and we intend to do so,' Veolia's General Manager Mitch Osborne said.

Rogers and company aren't convinced.

'Until you show me proof I say be 1,000 percent concerned,' Rogers said of the ashes.

Osborne remained confident the Ebola, which dies at 100 degrees, was killed by the 1,500-plus incinerator.
