Staunch criticism: Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, is a frontrunner to replace Mervyn King at the Bank of England when he steps down next year

Banks rip off customers and give the impression that they serve only their own interests, Britain’s top regulator warned yesterday.

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said millions have lost trust in the financial services industry.

He said people were ‘angry with banks and bankers’ and added: ‘They doubt banks’ values, and they doubt whether banks have their interests at heart.’

In a speech in London yesterday, he criticised the culture in the City, singling out the example of bankers drinking champagne to celebrate fiddling the Libor interest rate.

He said the incident had exposed ‘a dealing room culture of cynical greed’.

The only way to stop the view that these people are ‘banksters’ – a pun on the word ‘gangsters’ coined by headline writers – is for bosses to make controlling dishonest behaviour their number one job.

Huge bonuses have ‘amazed and bewildered’ hard-working people, who can earn less in a lifetime than a City worker gets in a single bonus.

Lord Turner, a front runner to become governor of the Bank of England when Sir Mervyn King steps down next year, told an audience of business leaders that a series of scandals had destroyed banks’ reputation.

In recent weeks, Barclays’ three most senior executives have resigned over its manipulation of the inter-bank lending rate, Libor, and it has emerged that HSBC laundered billions of pounds from rogue states and drug cartels.

This is on top of the £9billion mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

Lord Turner warned: ‘There is far greater potential in retail financial services than in other sectors for producers to rip off consumers.’

He questioned how some bankers can go home at night thinking they are ‘a fine upstanding member of society’ when they have simply sold on toxic loans to ‘ill-informed investors’.

He added: ‘Banks are only likely to earn the trust of customers and the respect of society at large if, from the very top, there is a clear message.

‘[It is] that there are many things which may be profitable, which may be within the legal rules, and which neither the customer nor the supervisor will necessarily ever spot... but which go against firm values and which the bank therefore will not do.’

He suggested that if a bank fails in the future, there should be ‘automatic sanctions’ against directors. They must prove their innocence, rather than the regulator having to prove his or her guilt.

His comments came as Lord Green, the trade minister and former chairman of HSBC, yesterday admitted in a letter that he ‘regrets’ the bank’s serial money laundering.

But Labour’s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, said the letter ‘totally fails to address questions about what he knew and when’.

Mr Leslie said Lord Green must come to the House of Lords to explain.
