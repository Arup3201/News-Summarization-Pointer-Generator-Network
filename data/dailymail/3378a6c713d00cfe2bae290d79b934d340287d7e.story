A 47-year-old married mother who fled to Canada to avoid a 30 year jail sentence for having sex with a teenager faces being kicked out of the country.

Denise Harvey, of Florida, was stripped off her refugee status by Canada's Federal Court and could be extradited back to the US to serve her sentence.

Harvey has been told she had a final chance to argue that she should be allowed to stay.

Denise Harvey, of Florida, must again make her case for refugee status in Canada after fleeing north of the border to avoid a 30-year prison sentence in the United States for underage sex

Harvey fled from her home in Florida in 2010 after being convicted of having sex with a 16 year old who was friends with her teenage son.

She was sentenced to 30 years but while out on bail fled to Canada with her husband and family.

She was granted refugee status after saying she faced 'cruel and unusual punishment' from the lengthy prison sentence.

Canadian authorities agreed to allow her to stay ruling her actions would not constitute a crime if she had carried them out in Canada.

In Canada, the age of consent is 16 unless the older person is in a position of authority over the younger person.

The decision was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada who have now stripped Harvey of the refugee status.

Prosecutors in Florida are hopeful that Harvey will soon return to serve her sentence.

'We’ve been actively pursuing her but of course we were dead-ended by the Canadian government who granted her refugee status,' said Nikki Robinson, assistant state attorney who was a prosecutor of the original case.

'I’m hoping we’ll see her back. We’ll follow it up with the U.S. Marshal’s Office.'

Harvey, from Vero Beach, Florida, was convicted of having sex on multiple occasions with a 16 year old she met at her son's baseball matches in 2008

She began flirting with him and the pair had sex on five occasions, including at the victim's home and in her office where she worked as a mortgage broker.

The victim's sister tipped off police after she once walked in on them having sex.

After police launched an investigation, Harvey was recorded telling the teen to lie to police and tried to blackmail his sister not to help authorities.

After being sentenced to 30 years in jail in 2010 Harvey appealed, and when that failed she fled from Florida.

She was arrested in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan in April 2011.

Harvey claimed asylum and was granted refugee status - despite an extradition warrant from Florida authorities.

The Immigration and Refugee Board found she was a person in need of protection as someone facing cruel and unusual punishment by Canada’s standards, imposed on her in disregard of accepted international standards.

Canada’s Minister of Citizenship and Immigration sought to overturn that decision and the IRB was told it had not provided adequate reasoning on one element of its decision.

That element referred to the accepted international standards.

Harvey's lawyers have to show that the 30 year sentence if above what other countries would impose for under age sex charges.

Lawyers for Harvey have not commented.
