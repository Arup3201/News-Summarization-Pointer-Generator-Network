Zachary Gomo was attacked on Thursday about 10pm on a Melbourne street by two Arabic-speaking men

A former Israeli soldier now living in Australia has told of the shocking moment he was attacked on the street and was left with a slash through his T-shirt, a swollen face and covered in scratches.

Zachary Gomo, 28, was walking along Parnell Street, off Kooyong Road, in Elsternwick - in Melbourne's south - when he was ambushed by two men while he was wearing an Israeli Defence Forces shirt from his two-year stint in the service in what he is calling an 'anti-Semitic' attack.

At the time, the dual citizen was walking to his girlfriend's place when he noticed two men following him.

'The side street was very dark and apparently empty of people,' Mr Gomo said.

'When I got about halfway down the street, I suddenly noticed that there were two people right behind me.

'I got a shock as I had not noticed them until then which I found odd.

'At that moment they both jumped on me and started punching and shouting in Arabic "Jew Dog", "Allah HuAkbar" [God is great] and something I didn’t understand about Gaza.

'It completely came out of nowhere. I wasn’t prepared.'

Luckily, Mr Gomo was able to fight off his attackers, return to his girlfriend's house and report the incident to Caulfield police station.

'Initially I just attempted to shield myself from their blows, and then one of them grabbed me from my left side as if he was trying to drag me somewhere,' he said.

'At that point, I realised it was very serious and started fighting back.

'I threw punches at both of them and managed to grab one of them by the throat which I proceeded to squeeze as hard as I could.

Mr Gomo did not notice a weapon at the time, but police say this slash was most likely caused by a screwdriver

'I pointed at the other man with my free hand and yelled Arabic curses at them as aggressively as possible.

'This startled them quite a bit and when I pushed the one whose neck I was holding away, they fled towards Kooyong Road.'

When he got to his girlfriend's house, she noticed Mr Gomo was covered in scratches, his T-shirt sliced open around the belly and his face was swollen. 

'I did not notice a weapon at the time but the police later suggested that they might have had a screwdriver or something similar,' he said.

Mr Gomo described his attackers as between the ages of 18 to 20, slim and of Middle Eastern appearance.

He believes the T-shirt he was wearing at the time of the attack sparked the ambush.

'It has a scorpion on it and in English it says "stinger", which is the airforce special forces I was part of, and in Hebrew it says the word March as in the month and ’08 - the year that my training took place,' Mr Gomo said.

'There are some comments on the Internet saying that I provoked the attack by wearing the shirt, but I don’t think anyone deserves to be attacked like that they no matter what their wearing.

'There’s no way anyone would have identified the shirt unless they knew Hebrew.

'Clearly it was an anti-Semitic attack.

'I just think everybody has the right to be safe on the street and if you have a political protest or something do it civilly and within the law.'

Caulfield police station Sergeant Peter Burton confirmed the incident had happened.

'There is an active investigation going on at the moment,' he said.
