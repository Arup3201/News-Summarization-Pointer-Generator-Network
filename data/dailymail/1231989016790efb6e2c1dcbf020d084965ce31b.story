A massive fire engulfed the arrivals hall at Kenya's main international airport today, forcing the closure of East Africa's largest hub and the re-routing of all inbound flights.

Dark black smoke was visible across much of Nairobi as emergency teams battled the blaze at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

The blaze - which broke out on the 15th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy 
bombings in Nairobi and neighbouring Dar es Salaam, Tanzania - raged for
four hours before being contained.

Blaze: The massive fire closed East Africa's largest airport and caused flights to be diverted

Stranded passengers were left standing on pavements outside the airport with their luggage in hand as the fire raged.

Reporters at the scene said the fire 
had gutted the international arrivals hall where passengers pass through
immigration and retrieve their luggage. Â 

Kenya Airports Authority said the airport had been closed until further notice so emergency teams could battle the fire.

While there were no immediate signs 
that terrorism played any role in the fire, Kenya's anti-terror police 
chief, Boniface Mwaniki, said he wanted to wait for the fire to be put 
out so he could inspect the scene before making any judgment.

Michael Kamau, the cabinet secretary 
for transport and infrastructure, said the fire began at 5am in the 
immigration section of the arrivals hall. He said no injuries had been 
reported.

Inbound flights were diverted to the coastal city of Mombasa, he said.

The Kenyan capital's airport is the busiest airport in East Africa and its closure will affect flights throughout the region.

Flames: Passengers said they heard as explosions believed to be gas canisters on fire at the airport

Emergency: Stranded passengers said they were surprised the airport was not closed sooner as the fire spread

Engulfed: The blaze spread through the arrivals hall of the international airport on Wednesday morning

A British passenger, Martyn Collbeck,
said he was surprised that the airport was not shut down sooner so 
emergency vehicles could respond.

'When I arrived there were one or two
fire engines parked outside the international arrivals. It spread very 
fast,' said Mr Collbeck, who had been scheduled to fly to London on an 
early morning KLM flight.

'There were a couple of explosions 
which I think were a couple of gas canisters. I would have expected more
fire engines to respond faster.'

Barry Fisher, a trade specialist who lives in Nairobi, described the scene as chaos.

'It was huge, the smoke billowing, 
and it didn't seem to be stopping. There was no one stopping any traffic
going to the road to the airport.

'A number of fire trucks and 
ambulances were trying to negotiate their way through the lane. They 
were trying to weave their way through a solid two lanes of cars.'

The country's largest newspaper, the 
Daily Nation, reported last month that Nairobi County does not have a 
single working fire engine, and that three fire engines were auctioned 
off in 2009 because the county had not paid a repair bill.

'It is a disgrace of biblical 
proportions that the entire Nairobi County does not have a public fire 
engine in working condition,' the paper wrote in an editorial last 
month.

'When (government leaders) were 
debating their budgets, they did not deem it fit to set aside money 
either to buy new ones or repair the old ones. But they did set aside 
money to build mansions for governors, (buy) big vehicles for county 
executives and other needs without a direct benefit to Kenyans.'

The paper said the collapse of the 
fire department means responses to disasters are in the hands of private
companies and the military.
