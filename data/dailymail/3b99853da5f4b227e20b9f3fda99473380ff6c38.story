To pull on the England shirt, to wear those Three Lions on the left breast, is the biggest honour in the game.

Estonia away or Brazil at home: every cap for your country counts.

So what, if anything, fried Raheem Sterling’s brain after he played just 45 minutes of England’s thumping 5-0 victory over San Marino at Wembley on Thursday evening?

We must remember Sterling is 19. To kill this kid for pulling out of an international match is dangerous territory.

Far better to look into the real reasons why a player Roy Hodgson regards as the brightest talent in English football has opted out of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn.

If Sterling really approached Hodgson at London Colney on Saturday morning to ask not to play, then there is a deeper, wider psychological issue in our game.

It would be remiss of club and country if they don't provide whatever emotional support he needs.

‘Raheem Sterling is a teenager,’ tweeted Gary Lineker. ‘Teenagers do get tired and even moody. He's young, still developing, we should cut him some slack.’

Lineker is right, but England must immediately start searching for the reasons why a player would pull out of the starting line-up more than 24 hours before kick-off.

Take Neymar, for example. At the same age as Sterling is now, the Brazil forward had commercial contracts with 11 different companies from TVs to sportswear to banks (to look after all that money).

The Brazilian was set up to handle it all. So why can’t Sterling, if Hodgson’s analysis is to be taken at face value, hack it?

Every player is different and Hodgson’s version is that Sterling, who has scored three times in the Barclays Premier League for Liverpool, was not mentally ready to face Estonia. ‘He told me so,’ revealed the England manager.

So if the relationship really is that strong, why didn’t Hodgson offers some words of encouragement when he sent for Sterling to save this game after 64 minutes.

England’s head coach turned to his assistant Ray Lewington to call ‘Raheem, Raheem’ back from the corner flag when he was warming up in an orange bib midway through the second half.

Then he left it to Gary Neville to have a few words with the Liverpool forward when Sterling swapped his red base layer for the red No 19 shirt of England.

Sterling came on and made an impression, but the expectation of the youngster is high

As he waited in the technical area for the ball to go out of play, England’s goalkeeper coach Dave Watson was sent out with a tactics folder to show Sterling the positions he should take up at set-pieces.

There was barely any advice, or a word exchanged, with Hodgson. How odd.

Inevitably then it was the Liverpool forward, the man too tired to train at London Colney on Saturday morning, who won the free-kick for England on the edge of the Estonia penalty area.

He replaced Jordan Henderson, racing around the pitch like a puppy chasing falling leaves. He looked anything but tired or fatigued, mentally or physically.

Sterling raises expectations when he is on the ball, perking up England’s supporters with those step overs, the double-tap touch he relies on to beat his opponents and then pacey, twisting runs.

Eventually one of them, when it first appeared that he was about to take on one man too many, that he won the 73rd minute free-kick.

Wayne Rooney scored and England maintained their 100 per cent record in Group E after victories against Estonia, Switzerland and San Marino in this Euro 2016 qualification campaign.

So what of the intriguing sub-plot, the story that emerged after England’s head coach clumsily revealed in a television interview before the game that Sterling told him he was too tired to finish a training session? At 19, this is highly unusual behaviour.

On Sunday he was made to wait his turn, sitting on the bench alongside England’s substitute keepers Ben Foster and Fraser Forster until Hodgson twitched.

Sat there in his tracksuit bottoms, just below pitch level alongside the assorted coaching staff, medics and substitutes, Sterling looked remote and removed.

Think back to Hodgson’s verdict on the Liverpool forward in a corridor at Wembley on Thursday in the minutes that followed the 5-0 thumping of San Marino.

It was there that Hodgson admitted there would come a time when he would have to manage expectations around Sterling. That moment has arrived sooner than England’s head coach expected.

Sterling had been on the field for nine minutes, looking like a puppy chasing falling leaves as he hoovered up the ground in search of England’s winner.

He made the difference when he came on, lulling Estonia’s defence into the foul on the edge of the penalty area that led to Rooney scoring direct from the resulting free-kick.

He made the difference, but these are delicate times for Sterling and it will be down to Brendan Rodgers to realign him in the coming days.

This is about a kid, a young player at the highest level of the game, crying out for help. Club and country should make sure he gets it.
