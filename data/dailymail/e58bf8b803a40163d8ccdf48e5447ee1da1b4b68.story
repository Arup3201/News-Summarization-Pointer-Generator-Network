This is the shocking moment a bus driver brawled with two passengers in the street during rush hour over a £2 fare. 

David Newstead was driving the number 89 bus in Bexley, south London, in March when Tyler Belgrave-Breeds and Sean Dickson began twisting his wing-mirrors after getting off when Newstead rejected one of the pair's out-of-date passes. 

Instead of driving off, the 44-year-old goes out into the busy street and starts fighting the pair, both 23. 

David Newstead was driving the number 89 bus when two 23-year-old's began 'goading' him into a fight. The 44-year-old jumped from his seat and began brawling with the pair in Bexley, south London 

The driver fixes his wing mirror as the two young men watch on before charging at them in the street 

The father-of-ten admitted affray and was handed a six-month conditional discharge. He also lost his job as a driver for Go Ahead. 

Belgrave-Breeds and Dickson were found guilty of affray at Bromley Magistrates Court following the brawl.

Magistrates' heard how the pair began 'goading' the driver and threw a can of drink over his back before the scuffle. 

Now the driver, whose nine children live with him, says he will not be able to make ends meet after losing his job.  

'I feel very angry as they have cost me my livelihood.

'What was the point? A £2 bus fare is all this is about. 

'They have got no worries and no cares while every week I’m thinking "oh god, how am I going to pay the bills?"' 

He added he felt let down by company Go Ahead.  

'I was twice spat upon by different passengers in incidents prior to this then when it happened they just turned their back on me.

'They have just abandoned me.'

Retired magician Brian Buzzing, 78, was on the number 89 bus at the time of the incident and gave evidence at the trial of Belgrave-Breeds and Dickson.

After allegedly twisting his wing mirrors back-to-front, the two young men then 'threw a drink' at Newstead before the fight ensued 

Lying on the ground Newstead and one of the men fight before the other walks over and becomes involved 

He told magistrates: 'They were really goading the driver into responding, into a fight.

'Both the accused attacked the driver, there was no question about that.'

Mitigating on behalf of Belgrave-Breeds, David Prosser said: 'It is not enough to be antagonistic, it is not enough to goad, only to threaten to use violence and I would suggest at no point does my client do that.

'The only time he used violence was when he was attacked by Mr Newstead.'

A Go Ahead spokesman said: 'Decisions of internal hearings are a matter for the company and employee concerned and we are not at liberty to comment on such issues.'
