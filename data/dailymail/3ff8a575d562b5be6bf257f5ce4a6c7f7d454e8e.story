The trend for baking has swept the nation of late, with cakes, cookies and confectionary fast becoming the 'It' food of choice.

But while other bakers battle with candied flowers, butterflies or pretty pastel icing, one adventurous type has created an array of disgustingly realistic sweet treats - including fungal toe cookies (complete with your choice of corn or chilblains), severed ear cake-pops, or blackened lung cake.

And if the Hertfordshire baker's cake covered in stubbed out cigarettes doesn’t whet your appetite, then how about a trashed trifle or a fish carcass cookie?

Yummy: The severed toe cookies are incredibly realistic and come with either fungus, corns, or chilblain

Tempting? The ashtray cake may look like it has been attacked by chain smokers, but the cigarettes are in fact cookies covered in icing

For those with a strong stomach and a sweet tooth, there is a choice of three mini toe cookies - fungal nail, corn and chilblain - all of which look like they have been freshly severed from a body. The chilblain toe is even crafted to reveal a bone peeking out of the top.

Similarly gruesome and realistic are the severed ear cake pops.

Intricate: There is such a high level of  anatomical detail in both the severed toe cookies (right) and ear cake-pop (left) with wax inside the ears and harden skin on the underside of the toes

Originally designed for the Eat Your Heart Out:This Time It’s Anatomical 18+ pop-up cake shop last year, the ears even have wax visible inside. 

The ashtray cake comes complete with individual ‘cigarettes’ stubbed out all over it and in the ashtray on the top, some of which even have lipstick marks around the ends.

The cigarettes are individually shaped biscuits that are then covered in icing and painted, while the tobacco around them is a mixture of crushed biscuits and dyed coconut.

Also covered in the sweet cigarettes is the ‘Trashed Trifle’, which bizarrely has a (sweet) pork pie on it.

Sorry for itself: The 'trashed trifle cake' perfectly emulates a cake in the aftermath of a party, with cigarettes, cheese on cocktail sticks and even a pork pie on it

Off-putting: The blackened lung cake shows the effects of smoking on the body (but still tastes delicious!)

Deceiving: The fish carcass cookie might look like something you leave on your plate but it is a sweet treat

Designed to resemble a trifle left over after a party, it has canapé blocks of cheese on cocktail sticks abandoned on top - and it certainly accurately resembles a dish looking rather sorry for itself the morning after a big bash

One of the more foul offerings is the blackened lung cake, which, showing the effects of smoking on a pair of (sponge) lung, would put the most harden smoker off their next puff.

These vile creations are the work of Nevie-Pie Cakes, a bakery based in Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire which usually sells less more attractive treats in the shape of handpainted wedding cakes.
