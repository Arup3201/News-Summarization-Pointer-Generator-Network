The attorneys for Cleveland abduction suspect Ariel Castro claim that he's not the 'monster' depicted in news reports - and he will plead not guilty to kidnapping and rape charges.

Castro, 52, was arrested on May 6, and accused of holding three captives - Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus - in his home for about a decade.

Speaking out for the first time today, Castro's legal team says that he will plead not guilty to the charges, and that despite the charges, he is not the man portrayed in the media.

Horrific crimes: Ariel Castro, 52, is charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape

Claims: Lawyers for Ariel Castro say that he's not the 'monster' being portrayed in the media, but a loving dad to his daughter Jocelyn, whom authorities say is his daughter with Amanda Berry, center

Survivors: Michelle Knight, left,Â  and Gina DeJesus, right, were in worse condition then Amanda Berry when they emerged from at least nine years in captivity - allegedly at the hands of Castro

Castro's lawyer, Craig Weintraub, told WKYC-TV: 'The initial portrayal by the media has 
been one of a 'monster' and that's not the impression that I got when I 
talked to him for three hours.

'I know that family members who have been interviewed by the media have expressed that as well.'

Mr Weintraub denies reports that Castro has cooperated with authorities and provided some details in the abduction of the three women after his arrest.

He told the station that the facts surrounding how the women came to be in his home will be revealed during Castro's trial.

Lawyer: Ariel Castro's attorney Craig Weintraub says that the facts surrounding how the women came to be in Castro's home will be revealed during the trial

He said: 'That fact will be disclosed as the case progresses. I am aware of how he came into contact with them.'

Castro's other defense attorney, Jaye Schlachet, says that there is nothing his client cares about more than his six-year-old daughter Jocelyn, whom he is alleged to have had with victim Amanda Berry.

He told WKYC: 'I can tell you that Mr 
Castro is extremely committed to the well-being and positive future for 
his daughter, who he loves dearly.

Man of 'monster'?: A report says that Castro had no interest in having children with Michelle Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and believed her to be 'mentally disabled'

'And if people find that to be a disconnect from what he's alleged to have done, then the people will just have to deal with it. We just know how he feels about his little girl.'

Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were in worse condition than Amanda Berry when they emerged from at least nine years in captivity at the home of Ariel Castro, accused of kidnapping and raping the women.

Castro appeared to treat Berry - his 'favorite' - better than the other two, the sources said.

'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight.

Knight told investigators she fell pregnant five times, but lost the baby each time. She said that Castro starved and repeatedly punched her in the stomach to force her to miscarry.

Police sources told the National Enquirer that Castro had no interest in having children with Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and believed her to be 'mentally disabled.'

The magazine's source added that he was grooming his 6-year-old daughter with Amanda, Joselyn, as another sex slave because the other captives 'were getting to old for him.'

The details are the latest startling 
picture to emerge of Castro, whose own family has come forward to 
describe patterns of abuse and bizarre behavior.

Monica Stephens - who was at one point married to Castro's son, Anthony - told CNN's
Piers Morgan that she once visited the home on Seymour Avenue, and was 
struck by how Castro would 'obsessively' keep things locked up.

She told Morgan: 'Ariel Castro always gave me the heebie-jeebies.'

Speaking out: Onil Castro, pictured center, and

first interview since they were accused of being involved in the 
Cleveland kidnappings case

Released: The brothers were accused of being 
involved in the abductions, but have since been released after 
authorities concluded they had nothing to do with it

Castro's brothers, 50-year-old Onil and 54-year-old Pedro, in an interview on Monday with CNN, described their brother as strange and aloof.

'I hope he rots in that jail,' Onil said.

An Ohio prosecutor last week vowed to try to bring murder charges that could carry the death penalty against Ariel Castro.

Those charges would stem from forced miscarriages that police say were suffered by one of his victims.

The initial police report on the case said that at least five times after impregnating Knight, Ariel Castro starved and beat her in the abdomen to induce miscarriages.
