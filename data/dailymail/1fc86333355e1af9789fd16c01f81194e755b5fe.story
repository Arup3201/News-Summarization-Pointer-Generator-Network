Two brothers groomed a pair of teenage girls before pimping them out to workers at a curry house for £150 a time after hours sex sessions, a court heard.

Mubarek Ali, 29, and younger brother Ahdel Ali, 24, were paid for ferrying the girls, aged 15 and 16, to a restaurant.

Ahdel Ali, known as Eddie, is also accused of rape and sexual activity with a child.

The offences are alleged to have taken place between March 2008 and December 2009.

Stafford Crown Court heard the pair groomed two teenage girls for sex before persuading them to work as prostitutes for them four years ago.

One of the victims, now aged 19, told the court she and her friend were driven to the Dhaka Tandoori restaurant in Wellington, Telford, Shropshire, after hours.

The woman, giving evidence behind a screen, told the court: 'Two of the men took my friend into a bedroom.

'It was after the restaurant was closed and there were three men in rooms upstairs.'

She said she went into one room where she found her friend having sex with one of the men. Another man asked her to have sex, she said, but she refused and instead performed a sex act on him.

She told the court: 'I felt I had to do it. I didn’t want to do it.'

When the girls left the restaurant they found the Ali brothers taking drugs and drinking in their car, the jury heard.

The girl told the court: 'They were just laughing. They thought it was funny because we had to do it and they got money for it.'

Earlier the court heard the girl met the brothers when she was 15.

She said that the brothers befriended her but when she turned 16 she was forced to have sex with men up to four times a week.

Mubarek Ali, from Wellington, Shropshie, denies four charges of controlling child prostitution, two of trafficking for sexual exploitation and a charge of causing child prostitution.

Ahdel Ali, 24, denies rape, 11 allegations of sexual activity with a child, three charges of controlling child prostitution, two of inciting child prostitution, an allegation of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and meeting a child after grooming.

The trial continues.
