A family feud took a violent turn last week when authorities say a man in North Dakota attacked his sister in the middle of an argument over a scenario that plays out in just about every home in America: The placement of the toilet seat.

According to police in Fargo, 24-year-old Thaddeus Morgan and his 25-year-old sister, Cynthia, were arguing over whether he left the toilet seat up on February 24 at their home at 431 4th Ave.

In the middle of the argument, authorities say Thaddeus Morgan pushed his sister.

Further, Cynthia Morgan told police that when she attempted to call 9-1-1 to report the alleged attack, Thaddeus Morgan slapped the phone out of her hand.

According to Cynthia, her glasses were broken when her brother initially pushed her.

When police responded to the home, Thaddeus Morgan admitted to authorities that he slapped the phone away from his sister, as well as grabbing her wrists and pushing her.

Thaddeus Morgan, however, claimed there was a reason for his use of force: His sister 'was throwing toys at him.'

When authorities interviewed Cynthia, she confirmed the cause of the argument - that the fight started 'because Thaddeus was upset because she got mad about him not putting the toilet seat down.'

Thaddeus Morgan was booked into jail on one count each of Class C felony interfering with a phone during an emergency call and one count of simple assault, a Class B misdemeanor.

Morgan has pleaded not guilty. His next court date is scheduled for April 2.
