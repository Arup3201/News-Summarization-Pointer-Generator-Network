Manuel Pellegrini has warned that Manchester City will be 'the team to beat' this season and aims to make at least one more new signing before it kicks off next month.

The Chilean led City to a Premier League and Capital One Cup double in his first season in England, and is determined to build on his success. City have already brought in goalkeeper Willy Caballero, defender Bacary Sagna and midfielder Fernando, and hope to add £32million FC Porto centre-back Eliaquim Mangala before facing Arsenal in the Community Shield.

Speaking ahead of the opening game of City's US tour against Sporting Kansas City, Pellegrini said: 'The squad isn’t finished and we will have until the end of the window to make our moves.

'We have options to change things, if 
we need another one or not. It’s very important though to see what we 
have in these matches – maybe one will go out but we have more than a 
month to decide.

'This year maybe will be difficult but I think everyone knows that Manchester City will be the team to beat.

'There
 are six strong teams who want to win the title but we have a trust and a
 lot of good players who can do the same this season as they did last.

'One
 of our targets is to do well in the Champions League. Last year was the
 first time we got to the last 16 but we are confident we will do better
 this year.'

Pellegrini 
knows that rivals Manchester United will pose a greater threat under 
Louis van Gaal after a dismal season under his predecessor David Moyes.

He added: 'Of course I think that United will have a different season to now to the one which they had last year.

'Van
 Gaal is a very experienced manager who knows what it is like to work at
 big clubs so we will have another important team trying to win the 
Premier League.

'What will happen in the future of United we don’t know, but they will be strong this year.'

The
 City boss confirmed that striker Alvaro Negredo has had an operation on
 his right foot after fracturing a metatarsal in last Friday's friendly 
against Hearts.

Negredo, who had been linked with a move away from the Etihad before the injury, will be out for at least two months.

'Alvaro
 had the surgery today on his broken foot and he will be a big miss for 
our squad because he is an important player for us,' said Pellegrini.
