Lena Dunham's presence by the side of Anna Wintour at a fashion party last night added further fuel to rumors that the star is set to cover Vogue in the near future.

The pair were seen mingling with guests at the 2013 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund party at the Chateau Marmont.

They also sat side-by-side at the event's fashion show, flanked by Victoria Beckham, Ms Wintour's daughter Bee Shaffer and Lea Michele.

In one photo, posted on Instagram by Public School designer Maxwell Osborne, they are seen laughing together, indicating that they are already relaxed in one another's company.

In the caption, the designer quipped: 'Oh Anna stop it. . . Lena you're hilarious.'

Their friendly appearance together follows a report earlier this week that the Vogue editor-in-chief is planning a dinner in honor of the Girls creator, 27, in a bid to persuade her to feature in the magazine.

According to RadarOnline, a 'well-placed magazine source' says that Ms Wintour, 63, wants to use Miss Dunham to attract younger readers to Vogue.

'Anna is trying to seduce Lena into bringing her next-generation audience into the Vogue brand,' they said.

The source continues that a cover featuring Miss Dunham would 'violate a lot of Vogue traditions' because she is 'overweight'.

'She doesn’t really conform to the body type that Vogue has 
featured for most of its history,' they added.

Neither
 Vogue, nor Miss Dunham's representatives was able to respond to MailOnline's
 request for comment on the matter, but if the rumors are true, the actress and writer would be one of a 
small number of curvier women to front the glossy fashion title.

In
 the magazine's recent history, Adele is the only other 'larger' 
celebrity to have featured on its cover.

American Vogue was praised for 
cropping the singer's body just below the bustline after the UK edition 
was slammed for dodging the opportunity to feature a larger body by only
 showing her face.

According to the source, the talks are in the very early stages, but Ms Wintour believes that she and Miss Dunham could both benefit from working together.

'This dinner is a first step for Anna to see if Lena will play ball,' they told Radar.

'But Anna’s perspective is that they need each other.'
