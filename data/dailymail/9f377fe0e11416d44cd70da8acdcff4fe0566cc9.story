Charged: Nicholas Gonzales, 27, who was arrested after breaking into a fire station and being caught masturbating

A drunk man was arrested after he was allegedly caught masturbating after smashing his way into a fire station.

Nicholas Gonzales was detained by officers after breaking into the Metro Firehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, in the early hours of Saturday morning.

It is alleged that he smashed a bay window of the fire station and removed firemen's 'gear' from lockers.

When firefighters at the station went to investigate the sound of smashing glass they allegedly found Mr Gonzales, 27, pleasuring himself in front of the equipment.

Firefighter Michael Davenport told WHAS-TV that Mr Gonzales never acknowledged him when he caught him.

He said: He continued his lewd act and that's when I grabbed him by his shirt and dragged him out.

Police were called and Mr Gonzales was arrested.

Officers reportedly said that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time.

He has since been charged with burglary in the second degree, public intoxication and criminal mischief.

According to WLKY.com, when asked by officers why he had broken into the fire station, he replied: 'Because I wanted to.'

It is thought that he caused around $1,000 dollars of damage by breaking in.

The station belongs to the Louisville Division of Fire, one of 19 fire departments which covers Louisville-Jefferson County in Kentucky.
