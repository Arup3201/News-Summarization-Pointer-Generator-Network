Clement Desmier, 68, was found dead at home by his neighbours

Detectives searching for the killers of a pensioner found dead after a burglary at his home are hunting for two men spotted lurking in the 68-year-old's garden.

Clement Desmier, known as 'Butch', was found dead at his Bradford home on Thursday.

West Yorkshire Police said they were investigating the possibility that the father-of-six was killed by burglars, after two men were seen in his garden in the early hours of the morning.

Neighbours who found Mr Desmier just before 4pm said the house in Rowlestone Rise had been ransacked, and that the victim - who lived alone - was found lying on the sofa with a pillow over his face.

Mr Desmier's daughter Lorna, who learned of her father's death on her 27th birthday, said his family was 'in shock'.

She said the 'loveable rogue' wooed her mother Katherine Guy, 63, by playing the guitar.

The couple, who spent 13 years together before they separated some time ago, had a second daughter together, Becky, now 25.

Mr Desmier was a musician who was well-know for playing his guitar in pubs around Bradford.

Lorna said: 'We're all just in shock, my legs nearly went from under me when I found out.

'I love him to bits, he had his ways but he really was a loveable rogue. He had six children who he didn't see a lot of, but we all loved him.

'He used to enjoy playing guitar, that's how he won my mam's heart,' she added.

A shocked friend said of the murder victim: ‘He was a lovely bloke, always happy.’

On
his Facebook page Mr Desmier had posted: ‘Free as a bird for the first 
time in my life,’ and described himself as a ‘man of leisure’.

Residents of Rowlestone Rise said concerned neighbours had gone over to Mr Desmier's house after noticing that an upstairs light had been left on all night.

After finding the door ajar and seeing the hallway in disarray they entered the house, where they discovered the 68-year-old's body.

One neighbour said of the victim: 'He was a nice guy. He lived by himself and kept himself to himself.

'He used to play guitar in pubs in the area.

'It's just so sad. There are problems around here but it's basically a nice street and you don't expect this.'

Det Supt Mark Ridley, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We have 
launched a murder investigation following the discovery of Mr Desmier, 
who is known locally as Butch, and are appealing for witnesses to come 
forwards or anyone with any information.

'We do have evidence to suggest a 
burglary may have occurred at the property in the early hours of the 
23rd and that violence may have been used in Mr Desmier’s death.

'I am appealing in particular for 
anyone who saw suspicious activity at the premises around this time, or 
believe they may know the identity of the two men seen acting 
suspiciously outside the property.'

He added: 'We know Mr Desmier was quite well known in Bradford and Shipley, would drink in local pubs and use local transport.

'We
are trying to build up a picture of his movements and lifestyle in the 
days before his death and I am particularly keen to hear from anybody 
who has seen or been in contact with Mr Desmier during the last week.'

Neighbours also said they had seen strange cars driving up and down the road in the weeks leading up to the murder.

Police said the last confirmed sighting of Mr Desmier was at 9am on Wednesday.

A forensic team scoured the house Mr Desmier's house for clues on Thursday as 
police waited for the result of a post-mortem on the victim.
