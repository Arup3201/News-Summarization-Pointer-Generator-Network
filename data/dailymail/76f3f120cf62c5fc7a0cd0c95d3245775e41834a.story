Gate guards at an Air Force base in central Georgia have been ordered to stop telling visitors to 'have a blessed day.'

A man who identified himself as an active duty military member posted on the Military Religious Freedom Foundation website that Robins personnel have told him to have a blessed day more than a dozen times in the past two weeks.

The man wrote 'I am an active-duty Air Force member/employee currently assigned to Robins Air Force Base, Georgia for the purpose of training.

'I have been entering through what is known as the "Russell Gate" since the 23rd of February.

'On no less than 15 occasions over the last two weeks, I have been greeted by the military personnel at the gate with the phrase "Have a blessed day."

'This greeting has been expressed by at least 10 different Airmen ranging in rank from A1C to SSgt.

'I found the greeting to be a notion that I, as a non-religious member of the military community should believe a higher power has an influence on how my day should go.'

The organization's president, Mikey Weinstein, said on the group's website that he spoke with base officials and was told that staff would no longer use the greeting.

Weinstein said base officials told him that gate guards will now say 'have a nice day' instead.

In an email to The Associated Press, Robins Air Force Base spokesman Roland Leach confirmed Thursday that the order has been given.
