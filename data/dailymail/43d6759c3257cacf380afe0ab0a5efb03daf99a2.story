A bus driver in Gulfport, Florida made a desperate call for help as he witnessed three teens brutally punch and stomp a younger student and won’t face charges despite video that shows he did not physically intervene.

Pinellas County driver John Moody, 64, put in a call to his dispatcher as he watched three 15-year-olds attack a 13-year-old, breaking the boy’s arm and leaving him with two black eyes.

‘You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick,’ Moody could be heard pleading in surveillance footage as the victim moaned with each kick and punch. 'They are about to beat this boy to death.'

Helpless? John Moody radioed for help but did not intervene as three boys, all 15, aboard his Gulfport, Florida school bus savagely beat a 13-year-old on July 9

The 18-year veteran did not try to stop the attack himself, which led Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent to pursue criminal charges.

‘There was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the welfare of the children or the child in this case, and he didn't make any effort to do so,’ Vincent told WFLA.

However, Moody was not required to help the beaten boy under Pinellas County rules. While some jurisdictions completely ban a driver from stepping in when fights occur, the Florida county merely allows a driver to do so if he or she feels it is safe.

Savage: The controversy began when footage taken from a student's cell phone showed the brutal beating and Moody not helping

'Quick, quick, quick!': Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent initially accused Moody of neglect, but video shows he followed protocol by asking dispatchers to get to the scene

Charged: Three 15-year-olds, including Julian McKnight (left) and Lloyd Khemradj (right), are now charged in the savage school bus attack caught on tape that left a younger victim with a broken arm

Additional charge: Joshua Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery for allegedly stealing the victim's money

Moody followed protocol, say officials, by radioing for help.

‘Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it,’ Moody said in footage from the scene. ‘There's nothing I can do.’

In fact, Moody says he was traumatized by the event  and has since retired.

‘I had many sleepless nights,’ he told CNN. ‘I had nightmares.’

Moody described the fight and subsequent controversy as the ‘final straw…and it was a big straw, too.’

‘Me jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys,’ he told CNN, ‘it would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as myself. There's just no telling what might have happened.’

Police say the victim was targeted because he was offered marijuana by one of the attackers and then reported the attempted drug sale to school administrators.

In spite of this, all the boys were allowed to board the bus together, which Moody’s attorney says points to a problem at the school.

'Stop!': Footage from the July 9 attack shows Moody yelling at the attackers to stop and repeatedly asking dispatchers for help

Brutal: The 13-year-old victim walked away with two black eyes and a broke arm

Nightmarish: Pinellas County, Florida school district rules allow a bus driver to intervene in a fight but does not require them to. Moody, 64, says the attack has left him with nightmares. He retired two weeks following the fight

‘School officials let these two boys back on the bus, or let them on the bus, and Mr. Moody had no idea what had happened at the school,’ Frank McDermott said.

Now the three accused attackers are charged with felony aggravated battery. One of the boys is also charged with unarmed robbery, having allegedly stolen the victim’s money during the attack.

McDermott says his client deserves an apology from local Gulfport police.
