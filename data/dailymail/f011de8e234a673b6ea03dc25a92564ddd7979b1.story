‘This book is a manifesto,’ writes Professor McWhorter, who isn’t messing around.  There is an idea abroad which, though  counter-intuitive, has taken the fusty world of linguistics by storm. The only problem, says McWhorter, is that it’s wrong.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world. So the French look at everything in their very French way — with an effortless sneer and possibly a cigarette hanging from their lips — not because they are French, but because they speak French.

Feeling French: The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world

This idea caught on in academic circles in the Thirties, when a fire inspector and part-time linguist called Benjamin Lee Whorf observed that the Native American language Hopi has no way of marking time. There are no tenses, no words like ‘later’, and Whorf theorised that these informed the Hopis’ sense of how time and the world work.

In Hopi, he said, past, present and future are the same, and this corresponded to ‘the cyclical sense of time in Hopi cosmology’.

The academic world being what it is, Whorfianism was succeeded by neo-Whorfianism, whose adherents continue to gather evidence to support the hypothesis. In Russian, there are words for ‘dark blue’ and ‘light blue’, but no word for just ‘blue’, while in Japanese only one word covers ‘blue’ and ‘green’. Does that mean Russians and the Japanese see colours differently? Whorfies would say they do, and have tried to prove it.

McWhorter thinks it’s all hogwash. Hopi, he says, marks time as much as anyone would expect a language to, ‘with good old-fashioned tense markers and plenty of words for things like already and afterwards’. And while Russians did press buttons slightly faster than English speakers when asked to distinguish between different shades of blue, it was only 124 milliseconds faster.

The theory, he says, simply doesn’t pan out. The problem is that the American media, not to mention a gullible public, really want it to work. ‘The language-as-thought idea vibrates in tune with impulses deeply felt in the modern enlightened American soul.’

But languages don’t evolve in any controlled or rational way. The Whorfians and neo-Whorfians are trying to impose pattern on something that has no pattern. McWhorter’s conclusion is almost painfully straightforward: that all humans essentially think alike. I find this strangely reassuring.

Readers of Malcolm Gladwell and the Freakonomics books will know that it’s much easier to put forward a pleasing new theory than it is to prove it doesn’t work. McWhorter doesn’t care about this, and takes to his subject with a giant scythe.

The elegance of his writing and the righteousness of his rage make this an unusually sprightly ride through the thickets of academia, where people will still be arguing about this long after we are all dead.

Therefore the French look at things in a French way - not because they are French, but because they speak the language

New book says the hypothesis is 'hogwash'
