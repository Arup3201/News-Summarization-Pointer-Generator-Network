It looks like a child's toy, but the 'little printer' could  soon change the way we use the internet, according to its makers.

Developed by design firm Berg London, it uses a thermal printer usually found in a supermarket till.

However, instead of receipts it can print tweets, Facebook updates, emails and even recipes.

Last year the firm produced a promotional video for the printer, which became an instant success.

'It’s been an amazing few months in the studio,' said the firm.

'Since we made the announcement last November, Little Printer has received loads of attention.

'The introductory video received half a million views in the first five days alone.

'Over 60,000 of you signed up to hear news, and we’re very happy to be able to bring you some.

'For eight months we’ve been getting a mirror finish on the plastic, folding steel, fixing radio interference bugs (there are some war stories there), designing characters, creating beautiful packaging, making the best possible API for developers, getting set up with credit cards.

'And today, finally, we’re manufacturing'

Users control the printed through an app, and it can be set to print at set times during the day

The printer is controlled via a smartphone app where users can choose the information they want to print, and when to print it.

The firm has initially signed up with several websites to offer content, including Foursquare, which can print recommendations for nearby restaurants, and recipe sites.

The printer is available to order online today, and is set to ship to customers in 60 days.

It can also print to do lists and even emails from a user's Google account.
