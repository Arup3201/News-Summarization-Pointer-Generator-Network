Sarah Palin today defended a photo she shared of her six-year-old son Trig standing on his service dog as she accused PETA of a 'hypocritical double standard' for criticizing her for the image.

The former Alaska governor spoke about the controversy on the Today show on Tuesday after the photo was met with outrage on social media and by PETA, who described her as a 'callous woman'. 

She said that she thought it was appropriate to share the photo, which showed her son Trig, who has Down syndrome, standing on his dog, Jill Hadassah, so that he could reach the sink.

'Trig's service dog is a strong, trained dog that does really, really love his best buddy Trig, and they put up with each other and there was no harm at all to this dog,' she said on Tuesday.

Refusing to back down: Sarah Palin appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning to defend a photograph she had shared to Facebook showing her son standing on his service dog 

She had shared the photo to her Facebook page on January 1 with a message for the new year. 

'May 2015 see every stumbling block turned into a stepping stone on the path forward,' she wrote. 

'Trig just reminded me. He, determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for 'up!', found me and a lazy dog blocking his way. He made his stepping stone.' 

PETA released a statement saying; 'It's odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo.'

On the Today show, she slammed the organization.

'I thought, absolutely hypocritical double standard, as usual, applied to, I don't know, perhaps a constitutional conservative,' she told Savannah Guthrie.

In another Facebook message, Palin had asked why PETA has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including Ellen DeGeneres, who previously shared a similar picture, and President Obama, who admitted to eating dog when he was a child.

Outrage: PETA was upset over this photo of six-year-old Trig Palin (above) standing on the family dog, Jill

Inspiring: The intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing Trig's resilience 

'At least Trig didn't eat the dog,' she wrote.

On the Today show on Tuesday, she defended the line when Guthrie asked if it was a cheap shot.

'Oh heck no, that was the best line in the post that I wrote,' she said. 'It was the kickoff line.' 

The comment was in reference to Obama's admission years ago that as a child in Indonesia he did once eat dog meat, and he later mocked Palin at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner saying: 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.'

She added on the Today show that left wing radicals 'look at him as their messiah but he as a child, probably the same age as Trig, did much worse than use the dog as a stepping stool'.

In her post, Palin also asked why PETA never attacked Ellen DeGeneres - PETA's Woman of the Year in 2009 - for a photo on her Instagram page showing of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth. That child, a little girl, does appear to be much younger and smaller thanTrig.  

She admitted she and the organization agree on one thing - 'respecting God's creation and critters' - but added that they probably weren't too happy that she enjoyed hunting her food.

Old news: Palin says that at least her son 'didn't eat the dog,' and then goes on to say that President Obama (above) 'enjoys eating dog meat'. He once admitted he had eaten dog as a child in Indonesia

Loved: Palin insisted that the family loves all of their pets and called Trig Jill's 'best buddy'

Still, she gushed about the animals the family keep in the house. 

'Our pets, including Trig's best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don't fit your flighty standards,' she wrote.

On the Today show, she also explained the dog's odd name, Jill Hadassah.  

'I had a roommate in college named Jill, loved her, always wanted a Jill, and then Hadassah, that's a Jewish name for Esther,' she said. 'I love in the Bible, the Book of Esther. I didn't have a sixth kid, but had a dog, and finally I got to use those names.' 

Dear PETA,

Chill. At least Trig didn't eat the dog.

Hey, by the way, remember your 'Woman of the Year', Ellen DeGeneres? Did you get all wee-wee'd up when she posted this sweet picture?

Hypocritical, much?

Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat?

Aren't you the double-standard radicals always opposing Alaska's Iditarod – the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces, while some of your pets 'thrive' in a concrete jungle where they're allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day? 

Aren't you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs, claiming I encourage slaying and consuming wild, organic healthy protein sources called 'fish'? (I do.)

Aren't you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs, wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin' new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols (who sport fur and crocodile purses) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same Louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe (that I used to strip from our Bristol Bay-caught fish, and in a Dillingham cannery I packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood)? I believe you call those discarded funky eggs 'caviar'.

Yeah, you're real credible on this, PETA. A shame, because I'll bet we agree on what I hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting God's creation and critters.

Our pets, including Trig's best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don't fit your flighty standards.

Jill is a precious part of our world. So is Trig.

- Sarah Palin
