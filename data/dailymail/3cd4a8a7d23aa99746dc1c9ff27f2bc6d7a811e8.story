A couple who took their children out of school so they could have their first family holiday in five years risk being jailed after refusing to pay fines introduced under controversial new laws.

Stewart and Natasha Sutherland will appear before Telford Magistrates' Court tomorrow after they took their three children to the Greek island of Rhodes during the school term. 

The couple were given an initial fine of £360 after the family of five went away for seven days at the end of September, but were unwilling to pay.

The penalty then doubled to £720 because they did not pay the fee within 21 days.

Now the week-long break could cost the couple up to £2,000, while they also face the prospect of a three-month prison sentence.

The family booked the holiday in October 2012, before the new guidelines were put into force on September 1 least year.

Before they went away, the couple were warned they each risked a £60 fine for taking their six-year-old son, Keane, and their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, on the break.

Mr Sutherland, 39, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said, the family struggle to fit in a regular holiday and were desperate to get away.

‘It’s like a revolving door in our house - I come in from work and my wife goes out.' he said.

‘We haven’t been able to get leave in the school holidays at the same time for five years, and we desperately needed a family break.

‘I work in a sensitive job where 
staffing levels have to be maintained - there’s been a recruitment and 
overtime ban and it’s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits 
in with the rest of the family.

‘I
 know how important education is - but there’s a bigger picture. Family 
time is important, too, and the children’s behaviour and schooling has 
improved massively since our holiday together.’

The amendments to school attendance regulations ended a policy which let schools grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays.

Headteachers now are not obliged to give pupils leave during term time, expect in 'exceptional circumstances.'

Now, according to Section 444 of the Education Act, 1996, parents are legally required to send their children to school on a regular basis, and failure to do so can land them a fine or prison sentence.

Mr Sutherland added ‘I informed the school after the summer holidays that we were taking the children out for six days. At that point, I wasn’t even aware of the new legislation.

‘We had a letter back warning that as the time off was not authorised we could be fined, but the holiday was already booked and paid for - what could I do?

‘I’ve since become aware that other parents just lie and tell the school their kids are ill, but I was upfront from the outset and raise my children to be honest.

‘I’ve even heard of local schools 
advising parents to say their children are sick to avoid getting fined. 
What kind of lesson does that teach them - that it’s OK to lie and be 
deceitful?’

The couple are 
arguing that the education authority has no appeal process and they have
 no choice but to go to court to have their say.

Mr Sutherland said: ‘This is not about the fine or the cost of the holidays outside of school term, it is about the principle. I could not have holiday any other time.

‘We spoke to the school attendance officer and things looked hopeful that the fines would be quashed.

‘But the next day we had an email back saying once a fine had been issued, it couldn’t be withdrawn.

‘I asked the attendance officer to put herself in our shoes - the kids go back to school and their friends ask where they’ve been over the holidays.

‘They have to say 'nowhere, my dad was working.

The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school.

It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days.

After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court.

The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil.

If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence.

If the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so, he is guilty of an offence.

If a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month prison sentence. 

The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools.

'I told the attendance officer they were trying to deprive children of having a holiday and I was told I’d deprived them of six days education and should feel guilty.

‘We are their parents; it should be up to us. I have no concerns over any of my children or their level of education. They are all in the top sets, and we believe quality family time is just as important as schooling.

‘We are bringing our children up to value their education, we know how important it is, but we are being punished for three things, because we work full-time, the fines are double because we are married, and finally because we were honest enough to tell the school the truth about the holiday instead of simply saying the kids were ill.’

Kay Burford, attendance support team leader for Telford & Wrekin Council said the new legislation is clear and any time off is disruptive to a child’s education.

She said: ‘Our policy supports new legislation which makes it clear that head teachers may not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances.

‘Leave in term-time which results in significant absence from school is disruptive to the child’s education and has a detrimental impact on attainment. There is no automatic right to any leave or holiday in term time. The regulations clearly make the point that the headteacher has the final decision as to whether to authorise the leave or not.

‘The Telford & Wrekin Council LA Policy Statement has been developed within the context of the national and local priority of raising the educational achievement and attainment of pupils. The Government has renewed appeals to parents not to take their children out of school during term time.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging
effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more
likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent.

'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle
poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also
increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the
amount of time they have to pay.

'Parents should never simply discount a possible penalty
notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence
and when doing so they are always risking prosecution'
