At first glance, it may look like a log covered in insects, or even two snakes moving in tandem.

But this wriggling mass is made up of hundreds of fungus gnat larvae, or larval Sciaridae, swarming together.

It is thought the insects travel en masse to deter predators, and those on the inside are the dominant members of the group being shielded by the lesser members.

The stuff of nightmares? This wriggling mass is made up of hundreds of fungus gnat larva, or larval Sciaridae, swarming together. It is thought the insects travel en masse to put off predators and those on the outside are the dominant members of the group 

While they appear more conspicuous, they ‘look hard,’ Dr Erica McAlister, fly curator at the Natural History Museum, London, told MailOnline. ‘Birds are more likely to think it’s a snake than larvae,’ she said. 

Dr Sophie Evison, a biology lecturer at Leeds University explained that the insects are demonstrating ‘the selfish herd theory’.

This is when individuals within a population – in this case gnat larvae - attempt to reduce the odds of being eaten by putting others of their own species between themselves and predators, resulting in an aggregation, or swarm.

The theory was proposed by W. D. Hamilton in 1971 to explain the gregarious behaviour observed in a variety of animals, including insects, schools of fish and even herds of wildebeest.

‘The outer layer of larvae are more exposed than creatures towards the centre, so the less dominant ones are on the outside,’ she said.

The idea is that subordinate animals will be forced into higher risk positions and you can see the larvae changing places in the swarm as it wiggles along.

It is thought that the tiny creatures signify their dominance using chemical trails, which lots of insects use to move along together.

Steve Ormerod, Professor of Ecology at Cardiff University’s School of Biosciences, told MailOnline: ‘Aggregations of insects can occur around resources such as food, shelter or, in adult insects, mates.

‘The avoidance of predators can also cause aggregations - where the likelihood of any individual being preyed upon is reduced where the predator or swamped or affected by some consequence of group behaviour.’

The sight was captured at an unknown location in the U.S. where the larvae seem to be 'walking' along the pavement. 

While gnat larvae aggregations may seem rare, many examples have been documented in that species, and in others such as sawfly in Brazil, where Dr Evison said they are common.

‘You’re unlikely to see them in this climate because it’s not warm enough. Insects are exothermic and rely on the sun to warm up,’ she said.

Professor Jim Hardie, Director of Science at the Royal Entomological Society, said: 'There are over 400 species of fungus gnats in the UK and the larvae, of some species at least, will form these swarms.'

Fungus gnats usually feed on fungi and rotting leaves, while the adults fly around houses in the summer.

'Not much is known about the larval stages or life cycles, but the normal environment for larvae and their fungus food supply, is moist.

'If the area dries out or populations build too high, a cohesive mass may be assisted by an aggregation,' he said.

Charles Brues of Harvard University, wrote an account of this strange sight over 50 years ago.

He wrote: ‘On the morning of June 15, 1949 we witnessed a mass migration of fungus-gnat larvae in the rainforest zone of Negros Island - an island in the Philippines - at an altitude of about 4,000ft (1,200 metres).

‘Close to a temporary shelter in which we were housed, my wife noticed a strange crawling object moving over the wet, muddy soil.

‘Closer examination at once disclosed that this was an irregular, band-like mass of small dipterous maggots.’ He identified them as Heerwiirmer or snake-worms.

‘…The mass of larvae was moving slowly in a very irregular band about a foot in length, less than an inch in width and layered to a depth of about half an inch.

‘As has been described in some previously observed cases, the individual larvae were moving on the slimy bodies of their fellows so that progression is accomplished by the forward motion of those on the top, while those at the rear, as they are uncovered, move with a sort of superficial, belt-like, rolling motion over the cramped individuals in the lower layers.

‘Thus, the mass moves onward, but the larvae are continually changing position with reference to one another.’
