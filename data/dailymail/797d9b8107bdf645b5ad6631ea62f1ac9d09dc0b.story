Graham Cooper evaded justice for 30 years before being jailed when a victim discovered he had been chosen to run a leg in the Olympic torch relay

A paedophile who evaded justice for 30 years has finally been jailed after his victim discovered he had been chosen to run a leg in the London 2012 Olympic torch relay.

The sudden fame enjoyed by Graham Cooper ‘incensed’ a woman who had suffered sex attacks at his hands as a girl from the ages of ten to 13 in the early 1980s.

A previous complaint that she made about the 69-year-old was not pursued by police, but after seeing him basking in the glory of the Olympics torch relay she contacted officers again.

Cooper, a grandfather from New Romney, Kent, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault on a girl aged under 14 and one count of indecency with a child.

A jury at Canterbury Crown Court last month convicted him of indecent assault, but cleared him of an alleged rape and two more indecent assaults.

Cooper was regarded as an upstanding pillar of the small community of Aldington, where he was known for his charity work and regular attendance at church.

His wife of 40 years, Sylvia, nominated him to become an Olympic torchbearer as reward for his years of working in the neighbourhood and raising money for good causes.

But after he carried the torch in South Kent in July last year, his victim heard about his achievement in the media.

She called police again about the abuse she suffered three decades earlier.

Jailing him for three years, Judge Adele Williams said the abuse Cooper committed had a ‘profound and long-lasting’ impact on the victim who has had to undergo counselling and therapy.

The judge said Cooper had a ‘total lack of insight’ over what he had done to the woman, adding: ‘She tried to complain to the police but that was not pursued.

‘But when she saw in the press that you had been chosen as an Olympic torchbearer in 2012 because of your good work and good standing in the community, she was rightly incensed and went to the police again.’

Cooper, who showed no emotion as sentence was passed, was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order and told to sign the sex offenders register. Both orders will last ten years.Peter Alcock, defending, asked the judge to take into account Cooper’s age, the historic nature of the offences and his health problems.

He said an immediate jail term would be ‘more onerous’ for Cooper now than it would have been 30 years ago. Mr Alcock said Cooper had ‘lived a life with many positives’ and that good character references had been provided by community figures, including his vicar.

‘As well as the character references illustrating the many positives, there is also that he was nominated and then chosen to be a torchbearer during the Olympics, and that was a matter in the trial,’ Mr Alcock added.

‘The complainant said that was what led her to come forward. He knows the wrong he has done in those years and the quality of the understanding of his problems is a question for further work.’

Cooper had the support of his wife and many friends, some of whom attended court to see him sentenced, Mr Alcock said.
