Just a day after it emerged that his 
mother was being given an inflation-beating five per cent pay rise, 
Prince Charles’s annual income is also on the up.

Thanks to record profits of £19 
million from the Duchy of Cornwall last year, the heir to the throne 
enjoyed an extra £763,000 in his ‘pay packet’, an increase of four per 
cent.

The rise was clearly welcome as 
Charles forked out around £1 million from his personal funds to meet the
growing official activities of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and 
Prince Harry.

On the buses: The Prince of Wales has cut his travel bill, but is in line for a four per cent income boost

Clarence House declined yesterday to comment on whether the prince is feeling the pinch.

But he did make a point of cutting his
personal spending – which includes everything from the salaries of his 
private chef and valets, to his and the Duchess of Cornwall’s weekly 
supermarket bill – by a substantial £200,000.

That amounted to an eight per cent decrease, from £2.6 million to £2.4 million.

A spokesman refused to be drawn on why
or how, but in previous years aides have admitted the prince has looked
at bringing down his day-to-day living expenses. His Principle Private 
Secretary, William Nye, said yesterday: ‘It’s a whole mixture of things 
to do with the way they live their lives.’

Of his £19,051,000 annual income, 
Charles was able to write off more than half - £10,952,000 in all – 
against tax as business expenses.

Clever accounting means that the 
future king charges everything from the cost of his offices and staff to
even the upkeep of his gardens at Highgrove, his private home in 
Gloucestershire which he also uses for official entertaining, as 
legitimate working expenses.

Boost: Charles saw his private income from the Duchy of Cornwall rise by four per cent to £19 million

To his credit, however, Charles 
continues to voluntarily pay tax, which last year saw a bill from the 
Inland Revenue for £4.42 million, marginally down on the previous year.

He also received a 47 per cent 
decrease in funding from taxpayers to £1.15 million. This is because his
travel bill was significantly cheaper last year, as many of the 
countries he visited – including Canada and Australia – also have the 
Queen as their head of state and therefore meet the costs of such tours 
themselves.

Details of the prince’s public and private spending emerged in his annual review, released yesterday.

It provides a fascinating insight into the heir to the throne’s household, who works there and how much his lifestyle costs.

His Principle Private Secretary, 
William Nye, described the last 12 months as an ‘extraordinary year’ and
emphasised Charles’s growing role on the international stage on behalf 
of his aging mother, who announced earlier this year she would be 
stepping back from long haul royal travel.

Mr Nye also admitted that should 
William and Kate decide to take on more royal duties in the coming 
years, then Charles may have to reconsider his decision to fund their 
official work.

Demands: Prince Charles had to pay out £1 million from his personal funds to meet the growing official activities of the Prince Harry and the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge

The Duchess of Cornwall’s sister has been paid £1.2million over eight years by Prince Charles for ‘interior design services’.

Annabel Elliot received £33,034 in ‘fees and commission’ last year, plus a further £7,160 for the purchase of furniture and furnishings by the Duchy of Cornwall, the accounts show.

In all, the interior designer has billed the prince a total of £1,198,629 since she was first  commissioned by the estate in 2005, the year Charles and Camilla married.

The Duchy admits the contract for the work was not put out to tender. But it says that, as a  private estate, it is not bound by normal commercial practices and is entitled to award work directly to the prince’s sister-in-law.

But he confirmed there were no 
immediate plans to do so, suggesting the prince, whose tour of duty as 
an RAF Search and Rescue helicopter pilot ends in September, may decide 
to stay in the military a little longer despite growing pressure for him
to become a full-time working royal.

According to yesterday’s figures the 
prince spent £212,000 on Clarence House, his London office and official 
residence and £644,000 on official travel by air and rail.

He has the equivalent of 125.4 
official full-time staff including 1.3 butlers, 4.3 chefs and kitchen 
porters, three chauffeurs, ten house managers and housekeepers and  20.2
garden and estate workers.

He also employs 22.0 staff of a 
personal basis including 7.0 secretaries, chefs and valets and 15 
‘estate, farm, garden and stable staff’.

William, Kate and Harry have a further 10.5 full-time office staff paid for by Charles.

The Duchy of Cornwall is a private 
estate, a portfolio of agricultural land (53,154 hectares of land in 24 
counties at last count) and property such as The Oval cricket ground – 
both of which generate vast amounts of rent – as well as some shrewd 
financial investments.

Pay rise: The Queen, pictured this week with the Grenadier in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, is to receive a five per cent rise in income

Since 1337, the estate’s profits have been given to successive Princes of Wales as the equivalent of an annual income.

Clarence House stressed yesterday the 
Charles voluntarily chose to use the majority of this money – some 
two-thirds in all – to fund his official duties, after which he plays 
income tax.

But in recent years there has been 
growing criticism of this ‘cosy’ arrangement, which is not subject to 
either corporation or capital gains taxes.

Parliament’s Public Accounts 
Committee, which has already hauled businesses including Google and 
Starbucks over the coals, is due to question senior figures from the 
Duchy and Clarence House over how it works next month.
