A Falklands hero whose medal citation was lost by senior officers has been refused an award – despite a high-profile campaign by his family, MPs and The Mail on Sunday.

The family of Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, say the soldier was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death in the battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982.

But because the handwritten citation was lost, the exploits of Cpl McLaughlin, of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para), have gone unrecognised.

Bravery: Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death, his family say

His family’s hopes were raised last year when Defence Minister Anna Soubry announced a fresh inquiry, but they have now been told that the review found no evidence that a citation was written. 

His brother and son furiously dispute this conclusion, while this newspaper has seen documents which appear to challenge the inquiry’s findings. 

These include a letter to Cpl McLaughlin’s commander, Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, written just days after the battle.

In it, another Para officer, Major Mike Argue, writes: ‘You have read my citation. Prior to his death, he led his section like a demon on the rocks of Mount Longdon. This was McLaughlin at his best.’

The inquiry dismissed this reference to a citation, and also ignored the recollections of General Sir Hew, who is adamant that a medal recommendation was written at the time. 

How or when the citation was misplaced remains unclear. Last night, Cpl McLaughlin’s brother Mark, 53, from Liverpool, said: ‘We have had a battle royal with the Ministry of Defence who have been hellbent on refusing Stewart a medal no matter what evidence we put forward.

‘The letter from Major Argue to General Sir Hew makes clear reference to a written citation. How can they dismiss it out of hand? I am disgusted but the fight for justice for my brother will continue.’

An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘The investigation was conducted to identify any material not previously available and found no new information, but again noted the courage displayed by him. 

'It found no contemporaneous evidence that he was treated differently from the other servicemen who were considered for an award.’
