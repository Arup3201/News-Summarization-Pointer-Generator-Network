Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer who legally took her own life three weeks ago, appears in a new video released Wednesday calling upon states across the country to introduce new right-to-die laws. 

The footage to mark what would have been Maynard's 30th birthday shows her impassioned plea for a change in the law on behalf of other terminally ill patients who want to 'die with dignity'.   

Maynard, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given six months to live this spring, grabbed the national spotlight for about a month after publicizing that she and her husband moved to Portland from California so she could use Oregon's law to end her life with dignity.

Maynard ended her life on Nov. 1.

New video: To mark what would have been the 30th birthday of Brittany Maynard, a right-to-die advocacy group has issued new video footage of her final interviews, three weeks after her death

Hitting back: Maynard defends her decision in the footage saying she suffered no coercion in her decision 

The new video includes photographs of Maynard before her illness. It also features the voices of other terminally ill patients and their family members. 

Oregon was the first state to allow terminally ill patients to die using lethal medications prescribed by a doctor. 

'I hope for the sake of other American citizens all these people that I'm speaking to that I'll never meet, that I've never met that this choice be extended to you. This right - that we mobilize it, we vocalize it, we start to talk about it,' Maynard says to camera.

'I decided to share my story because I felt this issue of death with dignity is misunderstood. I felt very valued by my physicians here, very protected. There's no way I could have possibly been coerced into this. It's not a fear-based choice - it's a logic-based choice. I'm coming to realize how much our community fears death and shuns death and how much of the medical community almost view death as a failure. 

'If I can play, even the smallest part in helping to reduce fear or misunderstanding then it's worth speaking up for.'

Since her death Maynard's impact has indeed been felt and her choice to die has already sparked debate across the country.

Four other U.S. states allow patients to seek aid in dying: Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico.

Compassion & Choices says legislators in about a dozen further states plan to introduce right-to-die laws next year, including in Wyoming and Colorado.

But the political reality is that such legislation has been pushed for years, often unsuccessfully.

The New Jersey Assembly passed a bill last week that would allow physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients, with some legislators citing Maynard's story as a deciding factor in their vote.

But Republican Gov. Chris Christie has said he opposes the measure.

WATCH BRITTANY'S FINAL MESSAGE 

 

Support: The video includes images of the many messages of support Brittany received since publishing her decision to take her own life

Advocate: Brittany Maynard speaks of her wish to help the right-to-die movement in the video released three weeks after her death. It shows messages from those who agree with her campaign across the U.S.

In California, the West Hollywood City Council this week passed a resolution that urges the Los Angeles County District Attorney to not prosecute physicians and family members who offer aid in dying to the terminally ill. But the state has no current bills or ballot measures on the issue.

In Pennsylvania, where a death-with-dignity bill was introduced in October, its sponsor Rep. Mark Rozzi admits the bill's passage will be an uphill battle. Rozzi, a Democrat, said it has been difficult getting bills out of the judiciary committee when they are opposed by the state's Catholic leadership.

Rozzi, whose 63-year-old father died of the same type of brain cancer as Maynard, said the young woman's campaign and his family's situation made it apparent why such bills are needed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

'I had to watch my father die of cancer... It was the most gut-wrenching experience our family and he had to endure,' Rozzi said. 'He would always tell me this is not the way he wanted to live.'

Compassion & Choice said its website has had more than 5 million unique visitors during the past month, while Maynard's two previous videos have been viewed more than 13 million times on YouTube alone.

'I sense immense momentum right now,' said Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices. 'Brittany Maynard is a new voice for a new generation of activists ... she devoted her precious energy to help ensure other dying Americans would have a choice.'

Maynard died in the arms of her devoted husband Dan Diaz and was supported throughout her journey by her parents.

New message: The new video includes photographs of Maynard before her illness. It also features the voices of other terminally ill patients and their family members.

In her latest video Maynard revealed her hopes that they continue her advocacy work.  

'I know my family will continue to take this torch along for me that they'll believe in the importance of what I'm doing,' She said. 

'If there's one message to come away with from everything I've been through it is no matter what life presents you with, never be afraid to use your voice. Speak up for yourself, advocate.' 

Not all the response to Brittany's decision has been positive. 

Some religious groups and social conservatives, including a Vatican official and the American Life League, have heavily criticized it. 

Just days after Maynard's death, the Vatican's top bioethics official called her choice 'reprehensible' and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned. 

But Maynard's mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response, saying the Vatican official's comments came as the family was grieving and were 'more than a slap in the face.' 

'My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation,' she wrote.

'Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles.'

Carryubg the torch: Brittany says he family will now carry the torch and continue her campaign for right-to-die laws across the country. She has been backed by her family including mother Debbie Maynard (right)

Support: In the three weeks since her death, Brittany Maynard's mother has already had to fight back against criticism from the Vatican 

'As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions.'

Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home.

Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing.

'It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and towards those around us.'

Monsignor Carrasco de Paula, whose Academy is responsible for ethical issues in the Catholic Church, even went so far as to describe assisted suicide, in itself, as a reprehensible 'absurdity'.

He added: 'Dignity is something different to putting an end to your own life.'

The Roman Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide, teaching that life starts at the moment of conception and should end at the moment of natural death. 

Brittany herself had words for such critics while she was still alive, 

In one of her final videos, she hit back at people who questioned her decision. 

'When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,' she says in the heartbreaking video. 'I still have enough joy and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now, but it will come because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week.'
