A 2-year-old boy has been struck and killed by a train in southeast Kentucky after he wandered away from his house and out on the tracks with his dog. 

Trayton Joiner lived in a house just behind the railroad tracks in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.

'He was three months shy of his third birthday,' Hopkinsiville police spokesman Paul Ray said.

The CSX train conductor saw the toddler on the tracks and blew his whistle and slammed on the brakes, but could not stop before he hit  the little boy - as well as his dog.

A CSX train, like the one pictured, struck and killed a 2-year-old toddler who wandered onto the tracks on Monday in Hopkinsville, Kentucky

Investigators are still trying to determine why the boy was on his own on the train tracks - and was not being supervised

Neighbors told WTVF that the boy slipped out of the house when his grandmother fell asleep. 

Police are investigating the incident and have questioned the family about why the toddler was allowed outside alone. 

The dog that was with Trayton, a pit bull mix, had an injured back but was taken to a veterinary clinic and is expected to recover. 

Neighbors were shocked that the boy was on the tracks by himself.

Trains are a regular fixture in the neighborhood, passing through several days a day at all hours. 

'It was heartbreaking to know that a child that young will be wandering around the tracks, but at the same time, someone should have been there to protect him,' neighbor Carolyn Forest told WSMV-TV. 

Some neighbors said CSX needs to put up a fence around the tracks running through town to prevent children from wandering onto the tracks. 

Neighbors say the boy slipped out of his home (pictured) when his grandmother fell asleep. The home is right across from the busy railroad tracks
