The house from the much-loved television programme Gavin and Stacey has been put up for sale for the tidy sum of £125,000.

The modest terraced property in the seaside resort of Barry, South Wales, was Stacey’s home in the comedy series.

Fans will be familiar with the house in 
Trinity Street, Barry, as the place where Stacey’s mother Gwen served up
 her famous omelettes. Pensioner Doris lived next door and 
Stacey’s uncle Bryn - played by comedian Rob Brydon -  lived opposite.

Moving on: Since Gavin and Stacey became a surprise hit, more than 13,000 fans have turned up at the house and current owner Glenda Kenyon (pictured) has happily shown them around
