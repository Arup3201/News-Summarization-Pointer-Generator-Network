A manufacturer has agreed to change the design of a bunk bed a year after a four-year-old girl accidentally hanged herself from one in her sleep.

Tegan Hancox, who would have celebrated her fifth birthday today, became trapped in the strap of her Hello Kitty bag as she climbed out of bed just days before Christmas on December 15, 2011.

It is believed the little girl from Coventry was sleep walking at the time.

Now the bed manufacturer will alter the design despite complying with safety standards after her devastated mother Becky Shreenan, 25, called for the change.

Mother Becky Shreenan, 25, called for the change. The company said it would lower the height of the posts so nothing could hang from them

The company said it would lower the height of the posts so nothing could hang from them.

It is also changing the instructions reminding customers to keep the bed fully assembled.

Mrs Shreenan said: 'The company are planning on getting rid of the lip on the corners so nothing can be hung on it even if it isn't assembled correctly.

'They are also putting more in the instruction manual about keeping it assembled, and also putting on the bed frame about the importance of keeping it fully assembled.'

But she was disappointed that the Japanese firm which makes the sew-it-yourself Hello Kitty bag refused to attach a quick-release catch on the strap.

Becky said: 'I don't see the harm in putting a clasp on what is just a child's play bag. If it had been on there Tegan would not have died.

'At the minute I don't feel like Christmas. I'm not looking forward to it at all.'

A spokesman for Coventry Trading Standards said: 'The bed manufacturer took some immediate steps to alter some things.

'We also made representations for the relevant European Safety Standard to be reviewed in relation to the physical construction, instructions and warnings that should apply to such products.

The little girl was said to be a sleepwalker who often would 'just get out of bed normally, come to the top of the stairs and talk gibberish'

Mother Becky, and Tegan's sisters, three year old Tayla (right) and Channelle, seven, (left) are said to be 'dreading Christmas'

'We are pleased that this review is taking place.

'The handbag was independently tested and was considered to be compliant with current legislation, although a recommendation was made to include a warning about the risks of strangulation.'

The accident happened in the room Tegan shared with her younger sister Tayla, in Westcotes, Tile Hill. Their older sister, Chanelle, slept in another room.

It was nine days before Christmas and nine days after Teganâ€™s fourth birthday when the tragedy happened.
