Killed: Matthew Peterson was found dead alongside his parents and brother in their home on Tuesday

A defense contractor and his family have been found dead in their home in an affluent Washington DC suburb after he reportedly shot them dead before taking his own life.

The bodies of Albert Peterson, 57, his wife Kathleen, 52, and their two sons, Matthew and Chris, were found in their Herndon, Virginia home around noon on Tuesday.

Police had gone to check on the family after the couples' employers had contacted authorities to say neither had turned up for work. The boys, who attended a nearby middle and high school, had also been out of classes.

Sources told the Global Dispatch it appeared as if Mr Peterson had shot his wife and sons as they were still in bed and then killed himself.

Police have not confirmed the 
identities of the family nor their causes of death, leaving neighbours bewildered as to the fates of the seemingly happy 
group last seen on Sunday at a community picnic.

But their names were revealed by local minister Reverend Tom Berlin on Tuesday evening as he organised a vigil.

'Everyone
is feeling a great deal of grief over this loss and are searching for 
answers that are not known at this time,' he said.

'While
the names of the family members have not been released by the police or
press at this time, this is the home of Al and Kathie Peterson, who 
have two sons, Christopher and Matthew. Many of you will know this family.'

Shock: Albert, Kathleen, Matthew and Chris Peterson were found dead on Tuesday at this home in the wealthy suburb of Herndon, Virginia

Scene: The family, who were active in their church, had lived in the home since it was built 28 years ago

Kathleen Peterson owned the local office supply store, KOPS or Kathie's Office Products and Supply, Inc., while Albert Peterson worked in defense for various local companies.

Chris was an eighth grader at Rachel Carson Middle School and Matthew was a sophomore at Westfield High School. Both were avid soccer players and active at their church.

Neighbors
said the family had lived in the neighborhood for 28 years - living in 
the same house since it had been built - and called them a 'fixture' in 
the community.

They added that they knew of no immediate family problems or 
financial difficulties, but that Mr Peterson's father had tried to 
commit suicide in the past.

Investigation: Fairfax County police are investigating the deaths of the Peterson family

Tragedy: Police have not disclosed the cause of death but said there does not appear to be a continued threat to public safety

Alvaro Lopes told CBS that Mr Peterson had also been taking heart medication that may have altered his moods.

'He seemed dizzy… just different,' Mr
Lopes said. 'Hearing about what happened today made me think that could
have something to do with it.'

Neighbor Ed Swanson

Another neighbor, Ed Swanson, said the community is in shock.

'He
was a good neighbor, a good guy, a good family,' Mr Swanson told the 
Washington Times. 'It’s a shock ... How do you react to something like 
this? It’s terrible.'

Sherry Webster, who lives near the Petersons, told the Washington Examiner they were a friendly couple. She called Mr Peterson a 'big, burly guy' and his wife 'always full of energy and talkative'.

A minivan, bearing a soccer sticker, sat
in the driveway of the corner brick home and a blue pickup truck was 
sitting in front of the house.

Police are not disclosing any details on the deaths but have said they do not believe there is a threat to public safety.

Community: The reverend of Floris United Methodist Church revealed the family's names

Loss: Chris was an eighth grader at Rachel Carson
Middle School, left, and Matthew was a sophomore at Westfield High 
School, right. Their classmates will wear black in mourning for the boys

Fairfax County police said the deaths 
are being investigated as suspicious. Autopsies will be conducted by the
office of the medical examiner to determine cause of death, they added.

They are also investigating when exactly the apparent murder-suicide occurred.

'The individuals were reported not being
at work yesterday and today, so we're looking at that time frame,' Lucy
Caldwell of Fairfax County police told WRC-TV on Tuesday.

The
church will be holding a candlelight vigil at Floris on 
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. so that the community can come 
together to express their grief.

Classmates of the boys also plan on wearing black to mark their mourning for the family.

Herndon is a suburb in Fairfax County, Virginia - 25 miles away from Washington, D.C.
