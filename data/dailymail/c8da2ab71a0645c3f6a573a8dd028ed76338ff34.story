Criminal families are being granted the chance meet up behind bars under controversial rules designed to stop relatives losing touch if they are both jailed, it can be revealed.

Tory MPs said it was 'disgusting' that inmates are transported across the country to be reunited with girlfriends, husbands, fathers and daughters serving time in different prisons.

Figures obtained by MailOnline reveal that despite deep cuts to justice budgets, taxpayer-funded trips are organised once a fortnight to ensure prisoners can ‘maintain strong family ties’ while on remand or serving sentences.

Under Ministry of Justice rules, jails have a duty to arrange inter-prison visits for inmates to see relatives also serving time

Under official rules published by the coalition, jail staff have to make efforts to arrange for inter-prison visits for inmates to meet relatives who are also locked up.

The trips, which could cost more than £100-a-time, can take place every three months.

Tory MP Priti Patel said: 'Prison is a place where criminals are sent to be punished for their crimes and stripped of their liberty.

'It is disgraceful to see bureaucrats allowing quarterly visits between relatives in jail as part of the Justice Secretary’s plans to remove prisoner perks I hope he will consider abolishing this entitlement.

'When members of our Armed Forces putting their lives at risk fighting for our country are expected to go months without seeing their loved ones, it will disgust the public to see criminals enjoy this perk.'

Relatives who qualify include husbands and wives, civil partners, children, siblings including half- and –step brothers and sisters, grandparents, anyone an inmate was living with in an ‘established relationship’ before being jailed and ‘those who have clearly demonstrated the intention to register a civil partnership but have not yet done so’.

Ministry of Justice records, obtained through freedom of information laws, reveal 28 inter-prison visits were arranged last year, including four male prisoners visiting girlfriends, two men visiting brothers, one man meeting his mother and another meeting his wife.

'Disgusting': Tory MPs Priti Patel and Nick de Bois criticised the arrangements, insisting convicted relatives should not be allowed to meet up

In 2009 Gregg Avery, the ringleader of an animal rights gang which targeted an animal testing laboratory, boasted of being transferred from Winchester prison to visit his jailed wife Natasha in HMP Bronzefield in Middlesex while they were both on remand.

In a newsletter to supporters, Avery boasted said the £110 taxi ride had secured ‘two hours of heaven’ together.

The pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to blackmail and were sentenced to nine years in jail.

Since then the number of inter-prison visits have risen sharply from just 18 in 2010, including female prisoners visiting daughters, husbands and boyfriends, to 28 last year.

Tory MP Nick de Bois, a member of the justice select committee, said: 'I’m glad that the numbers we are seeing are so small as it should never be the norm that convicted relatives are routinely able to meet up.

'Prison should be about punishment and rehabilitation of offenders, and I fail to see how anything but the most exceptional of circumstances can warrant a family get together behind bars.'

The rules state that the reunions behind bars must be arranged, subject to the availability of transport and accommodation for the inmates are prison guards

Official guidance which runs until 
2015 states that ‘subject to security requirements and the availability 
of transport and accommodation’, arrangements may be made for 
inter-prison visits to take place at three-monthly intervals.

Each prisoner must surrender one visiting order and each visit should last ‘as long as local circumstances permit’.

Steve Brine, a Tory member of the justice select committee, defended the arrangement.

He said: 'There's stacks of evidence 
that says maintaining positive family relationships during a stay in 
prison helps with resettlement on release so, we shouldn't bite our nose
off by arbitrarily closing down inter-prison visits.

'The Prison Service should, and do, 
manage each case individually which includes for-instance, a very 
different regime for high risk offenders.'

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘The purpose of inter prison visits is to enable close relatives, where both parties are prisoners at separate establishments, to maintain strong family ties.  ‘Inter-prison visits will be granted by the Governor only where security requirements are met and subject to the availability of appropriate transport and accommodation.

‘The decision to allow any visit must be balanced against the need to maintain security and keep prisoners in lawful custody.

‘Visits must be well managed, monitored, and where necessary due to inappropriate behaviour, terminated to maintain the good order and discipline of the prison.’
