Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Yohan Cabaye has recovered from a groin injury and has been included in the squad to face Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday.

Cabaye has been out since limping off the field in PSG's 2-2 home draw against Caen on February 14 and he missed the first leg of the Chelsea match three days later. The game finished 1-1.

PSG will be without Brazilian winger Lucas and right back Serge Aurier for the trip to Stamford Bridge. Both are recovering from injury.

The Ligue 1 outfit will however be without Lucas (right, in PSG's 2-0 quarter-final defeat by Chelsea last term) 

PSG lost to Chelsea at the quarter-final stage last season, winning the first leg 3-1 and losing the return 2-0.

Ahead of the second leg clash in London, former Blues defender David Luiz stoked the fire, insisting his old boss Jose Mourinho 'is not special' to him.

Luiz, who moved to the French champions for £50million in June, refused to admit that the Portuguese - commonly labelled the 'Special One' - was anything spectacular in managerial terms.

The 27-year-old told L'Equipe: 'He (Mourinho) is special for you, but not for me.'
