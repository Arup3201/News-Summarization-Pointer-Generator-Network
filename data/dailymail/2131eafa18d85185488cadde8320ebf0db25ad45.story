An innocent man who spent more than three decades in prison for murder says he refuses to be angry about his ordeal and just wants to enjoy 'real life'.

Kash Delano Register was wrongly convicted of shooting dead an elderly man in 1979 and always maintained his innocence.

He was finally released on Friday and despite his ordeal, Mr Register says he is not angry and is just relieved to be free and able to spend time with his family.

Vindicated: Kash Delano Register, surrounded by lawyers at the Superior Court in Los Angeles, sobs as he is released 34 years after he was jailed for murder - because the sole witness' sister said her testimony was a lie

The 53-year-old is now getting to know his daughter, who was born shortly after his conviction in 1979, 
and his two grandchildren.

He told the Los Angeles Times: 
'There's a lot of devastating things that happened to me, but there's 
nothing I could do about it, so I had to accept it as it was.

'Me being angry is only going to stagnate me moving forward.'

His grandchildren are now teaching him how to use a smartphone and he has been on trips to the mall with friends.

Mr Register was released by a Los 
Angeles County Superior Court judge last week after the sister of 
witness Brenda Anderson's said her account of the murder was a lie.

Ms Anderon, then 19, had told police she saw Register gun down her neighbor Jack Sasson at his West Los Angeles home.

But her sister Sheila Vanderkam told the court they could not get a clear look of the shooter because they were too far away.

Mr Register said he is particularly enjoying caring for his mother, Wilma Register (pictured centre) who has constantly supported him since his wrongful conviction

Mr Register always maintained his 
innocence and he was at was at home with his girlfriend, and mother of 
his daughter, when Mr Sasson died.

After his conviction, Mr Register made the painful decision to give his girlfriend his blessing to move on with her life.

But he refuses to be bitter. The devout Christian told the LA Times that every morning since his release he thanks God he is home.

He said he is particularly enjoying 
being able to care for his mother, Wilma, who gave him her unwavering 
support over the past 34 years.

She was the one who picked him up from jail and took him back to the family home after his release.

Mr Register's conviction was 
overturned when Ms Vanderkam typed his name into a convict website 
search in 2011 and was horrified to discover he was still in jail.

She tracked down his attorney and the appeal was made.

Court papers said at trial none of the seven fingerprints found on Sasson's car matched Register's.
