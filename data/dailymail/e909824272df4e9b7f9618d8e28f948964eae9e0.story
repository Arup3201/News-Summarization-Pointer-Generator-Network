For one, this was a case of treading fresh ground. Quite literally. For others, it was about settling back into roles that were once familiar.

Something old, something new. And something surprisingly blue, in the hue of Northern Ireland’s jerseys. Thankfully for Scotland, there was no off-colour outcome.

A win is a win. Even when it comes after the typical drudgery that international friendlies can bring. Let’s just say that no-one who sat through this 90 minutes will be feverishly petitioning for the return of the Home Internationals.

Matt Ritchie made his first appearance for Scotland against Northern Ireland on Wednesday night

Not that there weren’t points of interest prior to Christophe Berra’s late winner. At least three featured in Gordon Strachan’s starting selection.

A debut for Matt Ritchie was the headline act. A supporting cast of talking points came via Craig Gordon’s return in goal and Darren Fletcher being given the nod as captain. In a squad that has a settled core of certainties, Strachan’ s aims are all about fine tuning ahead of the remaining Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Ritchie’s admission that he had never actually set foot north of the border caught the attention when he was called up last week. Yet there was also no mistaking the pride felt by the Hampshire-born Bournemouth winger, who qualifies for Scotland through his father Alex - originally from Edinburgh. An instant first cap deepened the family delight.

The 25-year-old has been an integral part of his club’s highly promising bid for promotion to the land of milk and honey that is the Barclays Premier League. We will have to wait a bit longer for an accurate assessment of his worth as an international, but this was far from the worst start. He already has an assist to his name after plonking the match-winning corner onto Berra’s head.

Ritchie operates on the right but is almost all left foot. That quality was seen early on when he dropped anchor to deceive Daniel Lafferty and fired a curling delivery deep beyond the back post. It was tailor-made for Shaun Maloney, hardly noted for his aerial prowess, but his header back across came to nothing.

The former Swindon man has 11 goals for Bournemouth this season and offered a glimpse of that direct threat just after the hour mark. Working an exchange with Steven Naismith, he hammered a blistering drive wide from 25 yards out. Another, less powerful, effort was comfortably grasped by Michael McGovern.

While the Hamilton goalkeeper was just about the busiest man in Michael O’ Neill’ s line-up, the polar opposite was true for Gordon.

He had played the second half of the 3-1 friendly defeat from England at Celtic Park to earn a 41st cap, but this was his first start for the national side in more than four years.

For long enough, it had seemed that 3-0 win over Faroe Islands at Pittodrie in November 2010 might just have marked the end of his Scotland career. Here, though, was further confirmation of a remarkable revival.

At club level, Gordon could well end up achieving an historic domestic Treble with Celtic this year. Having come through a gruelling rehabilitation to fully recover from a complex knee injury, his free transfer signing stands as one of the bargains of this or any other season.

Yet he openly admits the dream of returning to a Scotland shirt provided another level of motivation on the long road back to fitness. Now that has been achieved, he has his sights set on a place in the Hall of Fame. Eight more caps are needed.

To grab them, he will have to hold off the sizeable challenge presented by David Marshall and Allan McGregor by continuing to impress. Not that there was much chance to do so last night.

In his 45-minute outing, Gordon was so under-deployed he could have scribbled out autographs to the supporters sitting behind his goal. The most excitement he got was a brief sprint out of his area to intercept a long through-ball and feed a pass to Craig Forsyth. Hardly enough to have his heart racing.

The biggest danger to Gordon was contracting a chill through inactivity, but that even that threat was removed when he was allowed to watch the second half from the bench, wrapped in a warm jacket.

McGregor took his place, so what odds Marshall now being given the nod against Gibraltar on Sunday? Given the opposition, the real decision about who is the new No.1 can almost be deferred until the crucial trip to Dublin in June.

The same might well be said of the captaincy. This was only Fletcher’s second start under Strachan and, with Scott Brown on the bench, he was always going to take the armband. Like Gordon, there were once doubts whether this scenario would return.

His fight against the ravages of ulcerative colitis has been well documented but, following surgery last year, this is the first season in many in which he can be considered fully fit for action. It is also the first of his professional life away from Manchester United.

Fletcher’s January move to West Bromwich Albion has provided him with the opportunity of regular first team action that was always going to be problematic as Louis van Gaal reshaped his squad at Old Trafford. His influence has been rapidly felt at the Hawthorns, particularly as Tony Pulis immediately installed him as captain.

Back on show at Hampden, he produced typical Fletcher fare. Nothing flashy, but a calm assurance in keeping the team ticking over. Win the ball, pass it wisely, cover space, repeat. Like Scotland as whole, he simply got the job done.
