Over $1 million in $100 bills was stolen from a shipping container on a Swiss Air passenger flight on its way to New York and investigators still don't know who's to blame.

The shipment on flight 17 left Zurich Saturday, but by the time it reached its destination at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $1.2 million of the $92 million aboard was gone.

‘When it got here, the money was missing,’ FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said.

The theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at the Federal Reserve offices in Manhattan.

However, it remains unclear if the money was stolen in Switzerland or somewhere en route.

According to ABC News, a forklift operator 'opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift. It was a hole large enough to put your arm in.'

However, the operator failed to report the hole because such damage commonly occurs to the crates after years of use.

'We do not have any indication of a robbery of a Swiss aircraft,' a Swiss Air representative told ABC.

Officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent.

A spokesman for the FBI in New York Jim Margolin confirmed that the theft was being investigated but would not elaborate on the details.

Investigators are now looking in to how 
many mechanics, crew members and airport personnel had access to 
the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and 
escaped unnoticed.

According to the US Treasury, $1 million in $100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds, meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash.

The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal.

At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'.

It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion.
