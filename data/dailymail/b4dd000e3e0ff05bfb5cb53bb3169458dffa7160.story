Three British people were injured after an explosion at a hotel on the Spanish holiday island of Tenerife.

A woman is said to be in intensive care with severe burns to her face and scalp following the blast at the four-star Bahia Princie hotel on the Costa Adeje on Friday afternoon.

Her eight-year-old daughter suffered neck burns and a man was treated for minor abrasions, the local government of the Canary Islands said in a statement.

Explosion: The blast occurred in the pool bar of the Bahia Principe Hotel in the south west of the island

Two other women, aged 38 and 34, were also treated for minor burns in hospital. The 38-year-old woman was described as a Belgian national.

The British woman suffering serious injuries, who was nearest to the blast,  was taken to the La Candelaria hospital in Tenerife's capital, Santa Cruz, which deals with trauma cases on the island.

Meanwhile, the young girl and man received treatment in the smaller Hospiten Sur in Arona, to the south of the island.

A spokesman for the Bahia Principe claimed that the British woman's husband and a second daughter had avoided injury but were 'obviously in shock' at what had happened.

'This was an accident and we still are not sure what went wrong - we are awaiting the investigation of the judicial police,' he said.

'The explosion took place in a metal buffet container by the pool which uses a flammable gel to keep food warm.

'The swimming pool is now open again and the hotel is back to normal.

'We would like to wish those who were injured a speedy recovery.'

Three ambulances attended the scene following the explosion, which is believed to have been caused by a beer keg in the pool bar.

The hotel was said to be 'busy' at the time with many guests, including British family, staying over the Christmas period.

It has 478 rooms, a spa and a private beach.

A spokesman said: 'At 4.09pm on Friday emergency services were called to an explosion in a machine in a poolside bar at a hotel in Playa Paraiso, in the town of Adeje, with several people suffering from burn injuries. 

Tourist spot: The four-star hotel is all-inclusive and is popular with families

'Emergency resources were immediately mobilised. Fire crews attended to inspect the zone but their intervention was not necessary.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of reports of an incident involving British nationals and are talking to local authorities. We stand ready to help if needed.'

The hotel's website says it is all-inclusive and is 'perfect for families and children.'

It describes itself as hotel with 'marvellous facilities, lush green gardens and infinity pool', offering an 'unforgettable vacation' and 'beautiful views of the sea and of La Gomera island'.

Holiday: The Costa Adeje enjoys year-round sunshine and is popular with British tourist

Adeje is a popular holiday resort, with nearby sand beaches such as Playa de Las Americas and Los Cristianos particularly well-known to British tourists.

The area boasts a lively night-life in addition to golf clubs, zoos and other leisure activities such as go-karting, fishing, sailing and dolphin and whale watching.

Enjoying year-round good weather, the Canary Islands receive thousands of British holidaymakers during the cold winter months.

Temperatures tend to range from around 24C in summer to 17C in winter.
