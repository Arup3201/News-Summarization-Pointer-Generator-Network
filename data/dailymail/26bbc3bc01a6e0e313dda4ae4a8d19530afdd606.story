Kenny McDowall insists it was an 'honour' to be caretaker Rangers boss - but admits he needs a break from life at the Old Firm.

Ally McCoist's former assistant has followed the axed manager's lead by handing in his resignation after just four games in charge.

He now plans to work out the 12-month notice period written into his contract - but admits he has no idea if he will be put on garden leave like McCoist.

The former Celtic youth coach has looked uneasy in the top job since being asked to take the team by the board last month.

And he admits he needs time to clear his head following eight turbulent years at Ibrox, which started when Walter Smith lured him from Parkhead to become first-team coach.

McDowall - who helped the club win three successive titles before the Glasgow giants were brought to their knees by the 2012 liquidation crisis - said: 'It wasn't an easy decision. It was one I discussed with the family and I just decided I was more than happy to honour my contract and work my 12 months.

Before their liquidation nighmare in 2012 Rangers experienced great success in the Scottish Premier League

'But the last four years have been tough. Everybody is aware of that. It was time to step aside.

'I've been nearly 18 years at the Old Firm. That's quite a long time and it does take its toll on you. I will have a break probably, but we will see.'

He added: 'This is a massive job and it's an absolute honour to be sitting here as caretaker. That's what made it such a difficult decision.

'To put my notice in wasn't easy but I just feel it was right for me and my family.'
