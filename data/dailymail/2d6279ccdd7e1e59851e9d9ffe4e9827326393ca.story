They come into your garden at night. You may not see them, but they are there. They are generally shy, but if you shine a torch you may catch their eyes staring back at you before they slink off into the darkness.

They are intelligent and cunning, so much so that they are traditionally described as sly. They steal items left lying about – gardening gloves, a shoe, a piece of clothing – and then chew their swag for the apparent pleasure of destruction. And there’s very little, if anything, that you can do about them.

These lines may sound like the beginning of a horror story – or a moral panic – but they are a description of that most familiar resident of our countryside and our towns – the fox.

The fox has divided the country in those who worry about its welfare and those who see it as a pest

Most of us have known him for a long time. He was there in our childhood in Aesop’s Fables. Then he appeared as a hero in Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr Fox, where he outwits the farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. He was a hero, too, in The Animals Of Farthing Wood.

But more often he is a villain. Is there any animal in this country which divides opinion like the fox?

The supporters love him; the detractors want him somewhere else, or shot, starved out, gassed or hunted by packs of dogs. Both groups have an equal distaste for one another.

Many of the fox’s enemies live in towns and cities. They object to their gardens being excavated. They dislike the smell he sometimes leaves behind when he marks his territory. They don’t like the way he scatters their rubbish in the course of his scavenging. They fear he may even bite them or their cats or babies.

Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox represents the fox as both cunning and charming

And, some might say, with good reason.

In 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled in their cot by a fox in Hackney, east London. Last year, another London couple, Anthony Schofield and Tammy Chapple, both suffered bite wounds trying to rescue their cat from the jaws of a fox.

Then there are the farmers.

Foxes
 eat their lambs and chickens, which, quite understandably, enrages 
them. They believe he should be kept under control though hunting, and 
they tend to resent the interference of townspeople in what they regard 
as a country affair.

For many the urban fox has become more than just a pest but a menace with several cases of children being mauled by the animal

A familiar scene: Urban foxes are known for ripping open bin bags when scavenging for food

This causes temperatures to rise perhaps more than any other issue in the politics of the countryside.

The issue of fox-hunting has become 
more than a simple animal welfare one. The argument has become 
ideologically mixed up with the politics of class. Toffs go fox hunting,
 argue some, let’s stop them.

I
 do not like fox-hunting and like many, I would not care to engage in 
it, as I feel sympathy for the quarry, but this crude attitude shows a 
real ignorance of how people live in the countryside, and is symptomatic
 of a more widespread lack of understanding in urban Britain of country 
life and the things it does.

So much for Renard’s enemies; now for the friends.

There is the vaguely approving householder who is tickled by the thought that there is a wild animal in his garden.

Alexander McCall Smith says he disagrees with fox hunting

Then, going up the scale of admiration, one encounters the passionate friends of the fox. These are the people who are all for helping the fox in what they see as his struggle for survival.

You can, if you wish, adopt a fox with one of the animal charities, for which you will receive a certificate of adoption and a stuffed toy in the shape of a fox.

Then there are the people who are prepared to resort to disruption to protect him: the hunt saboteurs.

I became interested in foxes when I realised we had one. Of course you never own a wild animal, but you may feel you do when you discover your garden is their territory.

Our fox could be seen regularly parading about on the lawn or walking along the top of the garden wall, which he used as a sort of raised highway. He appeared by day or by night, but seemed to prefer the small hours of the morning.

Alexander McCall Smith says his garden fox was never a nuisance for him

If he saw you watching him, he might pause and look back at you briefly before continuing with his journey.

He did not seem particularly concerned about being spotted, although there was always a certain furtiveness about his movements. He travelled, I decided, in the style of one who knew that he was on somebody’s wanted list.

He was never a nuisance – although he occasionally dug in flower-beds. His excavations, though, were small, and easily filled in.

Sometimes he yowled in a blood-curdling way and rather human way, especially late at night, leading us to believe that somebody was being murdered nearby.

My main concern was for our Tonkinese cat.

I thought that if the cat met the fox, the fox, being a sort of dog, would go for him. In fact, as I discovered, it was quite the reverse.

A fox might take a kitten, perhaps, but would be unlikely to attack a fully-grown cat. Cats have claws and teeth and can defend themselves very effectively against a fox. As far as foxes are concerned, cats are to be avoided.

One night I saw exactly what happens when a cat meets a fox.

The meeting happened on our garden wall, with the fox going in one direction and coming up against our cat going in the opposite direction.

The result of this meeting was the most ear-shattering howling from the fox, who screamed blue murder over feline intransigence. The cat refused to give way, but stood his ground until the fox, after several minutes of outraged protest, turned tail and made off.

Victory to my fearless Tonkinese.

'A fox might take a kitten, perhaps, but 
would be unlikely to attack a fully-grown cat. As far as 
foxes are concerned, cats are to be avoided.'

If even my domestic cat can see off a fox, then why are they hated by so many?

Yes, they can make a bit of a mess, but so do seagulls. Yes, they may be noisy, but that is only likely to be in a few months of the year when they are interested in breeding. Yes, they may take lambs and chickens, but it is not the urban fox that does that, but the rural fox - and that doesn’t explain the indiscriminate persecution of foxdom in general.

In my Isabel Dalhousie novels, about a formidable lady philosopher living in Edinburgh, I have made one of the characters an urban fox.

He frequents Isabel’s garden. He lurks under her rhododendron bushes. Every so often she sees him and he sees her, and there passes between them a moment if not of understanding, then of appraisal. She calls him Brother Fox and spends time wondering what goes on in his mind.

For many the fox is a creature that needs protecting rather than exterminating

That, of course, is more than idle speculation. Trying to imagine what an animal thinks, or even just feels, is a valuable way of reminding ourselves of how we relate to nature.

I remember being in Rwanda a few years ago and being taken into the mountains to see the great mountain gorillas. The gorillas walked right past us in the jungle, seemingly indifferent to our presence.

Then, one turned and looked at me. For a short time I looked into the dark eyes of the gorilla – he held my gaze and I held his. And I wondered how he saw me. What was I to him?

Look into the eyes of a fox and ask yourself the same question. What does he see? The answer may be unsettling.
