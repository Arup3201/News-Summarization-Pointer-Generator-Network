Despite being considered one of Britain's fashion icons, it seems Sienna Miller isn't a fan of the her home nation's style.

Describing English fashion as 'scruffy', the 31-year-old spoke out about how she considers French fashion to be in a 'different league' to her fellow countrymen.

The actress - who is the face of chic French brand Caroll - says she prefers the way women dress on the other side of the Channel, adding that their 'classic, timeless' look is much more flattering than London girls' mismatched clothes.

It is easy to see why Sienna is considered a British fashion icon as she attended the Vanity Fair party for the TriBeCa Film Festival on Tuesday in a chic black floral dress teamed with a red bag for a pop of colour

Asked what she thinks of French style in an interview with newspaper supplement Madame Figaro, she replied: 'So chic, so timeless... You French are in a different league in terms of elegance. Also, you're naturally slim.

'English girls are so much scruffier, especially in London where people really wear absolutely anything, in any old way.

'French girls manage to look desirable even when they're not making an effort.'

Sienna, 31, also revealed she is a big admirer of urban streetwear and wishes she was daring enough to pull off the look she believes is one of the most unique to hit the runway in decades.

She explained: 'I've been intrigued by the influence of hip-hop in fashion recently and girls who play with a new aesthetic.

Sienna is known for her edgy and adventurous style but believe she couldn't pull off the new trend for street-wear which she describes as 'not my style'

Sienna will no doubt have delighted her French fans with her comments praising their effortless style

'I've always thought fashion was a constant cycle, that looks from the 40s, 50s or 60s were repeated in a loop.

'But the arrival of streetwear is something really fresh.

'Unfortunately it's not quite my style... I would have loved to have been able to wear completely crazy outfits covered in graffiti.'
