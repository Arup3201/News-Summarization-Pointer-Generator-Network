Phillippa Williamson: Received £464,905 pay-off from the Serious Fraud Office

Bosses at the Serious Fraud Office secretly negotiated ‘irregular’ pay-offs for executives worth £1million by using personal email accounts to cover their tracks, the Daily Mail can reveal.

The clandestine deals for senior civil servants were arranged by a handful of managers at the fraud-busting agency – in part through messages sent from private addresses – to prevent other staff from finding out.

Sending emails from non-official accounts also made it far harder for them to be scrutinised by the public under the Freedom of Information Act, experts say.

Details of the shocking attempt to cover up how public money was squandered by the fraud-busting agency comes after the BBC was accused of failing to keep proper records of excessive severance payments to senior managers, which MPs likened to ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’.

The bumper payouts to the SFO’s former chief executive Phillippa Williamson and chief operating officer Christian Bailes were negotiated at the end of 2011 and approved by its then boss Richard Alderman without authorisation from his Whitehall supervisors.

MPs later condemned him for showing a ‘disregard for the proper use of taxpayers’ money’ and described it as ‘a case study in how not to run a public body’.

The Commons’ Public Accounts Committee also condemned the ‘astounding’ working conditions afforded staff at the body after it emerged that Mrs Williamson was allowed to run up huge travel bills commuting to London from her home near the Lake District.

The PAC report said: ‘Mr Alderman’s decisions and actions were based on a culture where external advice and scrutiny was to be avoided wherever possible, and with an apparent need for secrecy.’ It criticised the SFO’s ‘poor quality record-keeping’.

After agreeing the payouts, Mr Alderman sent a message to Mrs Williamson saying ‘please do not mention the severance agreement’ before an SFO audit meeting, the PAC was told.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s deeply worrying that discussions about the  spending of vast sums of taxpayers’ money were conducted in such a  clandestine manner.

‘The serious questions about the value of these payouts will only be compounded by the fact that these emails were exchanged through such informal channels.

‘Taxpayers deserve complete transparency when it comes to public bodies, and those responsible for these payouts must be clear as to exactly what happened and be held to account for their decisions.’

The SFO said last night that the agency’s new director had now issued strict rules banning the use of private emails for official work.

A spokesman said: ‘The current director of the SFO is clear no private emails should be used to conduct SFO work and has issued guidance to that effect, in line with Government policy.’

Information held in private email accounts can be subject to Freedom of Information law if it relates to official business.But official guidance from the Information Commissioner says occasions when staff are requested to search personal email messages are ‘expected to be rare’.

Maurice Frankel, of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: ‘Private emails are covered by the Freedom of Information Act but they are harder to get out.

‘It is more difficult for the Freedom of Information team in an organisation to say “We’re going to have a look for what’s there” if the information is on a private email account. It’s obviously very difficult for them to go to a senior person in their organisation and say to them, “We want to look at your private email”.

‘They are usually reliant on the individual admitting that there are some relevant emails and putting them forward.’

He said that if staff in public bodies had to send emails from personal accounts because of difficulties logging on to official accounts while away from the office, they should always cc the emails they send into their work account.He added: ‘If they are not doing that there will be a question mark about why not.’

Education Secretary Michael Gove fought a long legal battle to try to avoid disclosing an email he sent to a civil servant and two special advisers through his wife’s email account.

The Department for Education had a two-year dispute with the Information Commissioner that related to private emails before finally abandoning their opposition to making them public last year.

The PAC found that Mr Alderman had agreed to payouts for three senior civil servants who were taking voluntary redundancy without the required approval being sought from the Cabinet Office or the Treasury.

Mrs Williamson received £464,905 and Mr Bailes £437,167. The head of technology, Ian McCall, later received £49,885.

Mrs Williamson was also allowed to work from her Lancashire home and rack up travel and hotel bills of £98,946 for visiting the London office three days a week.

She had previously worked at the Inland Revenue with Mr Alderman, who described her as an ‘exceptionally talented civil servant’.

MPs on the PAC said Mr Alderman, 60, who retired as director of the SFO in April last year, days after Mrs Williamson left, had ‘failed to follow due process’ or ‘to comply with the rules that should underpin the use of public money’.

Mr Alderman’s successor, David Green, found out about the unapproved payouts a month later only following a ‘chance comment by a junior member of staff’ and after making some further inquiries quickly arranged for an investigation, the committee heard.

PAC chairman Margaret Hodge told Mr Alderman: ‘You had chats here and there. You decided the packages yourself. ‘You decided yourself that you did not need written agreement, you had had a natter with somebody on the phone. It is all indicative of a culture that you led.’

In a subsequent letter to the PAC, Mr Alderman issued a ‘deep and unreserved apology’ for the way he handled the exit agreements.

Mrs Williamson and Mr Bailes both declined to comment yesterday. Mr Alderman could not be reached as he is on holiday.
