Senator Jeff Flake's son and his young wife are suing Maricopa County Sheriff's office and Sheriff Joe Arpaio for $8million in damages claiming they 'constructed a conspiracy' to wrongfully indict the couple.

Austin and Logan Flake, both 21, are seeking $4million  in damages each after they were initially charged in the deaths of 21 dogs who died from heat exhaustion while in their care last summer in Arizona.

The couple's lawyer stated in a letter that the sheriff's office had a plot to 'harm their reputations by presenting false and misleading information', which caused 'irreparable injury to their good names and future prospects'.

The Flakes case against Arpaio and the sheriff's office is centered around claims including malicious prosecution, conspiracy, abuse of process, negligence, defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to their lawyer's statement.

The Flakes' attorney, Jack Wilenchik, said among the damages the couple have suffered from include Austin being kicked out of Brigham Young University, where he was attending school, after he was indicted on charges, according to ABC15.

Even though the 21 felony counts and seven misdemeanor counts he and his wife were charged with were dismissed in December, Wilenchik said the university has not reinstated Austin.

The lawyer also said that Arpaio was 'undeterred by the facts', and after conducting a rigged investigation, 'sent his detective in to lie to the grand jury'.

The events unfolded in June 2014, when Logan's parents, Jesse Todd and Maleisa Hughes, asked her and Austin to care for the dogs in the kennel, Green Acre dog residence, operated out of their home while they went away to Florida.

They found 21 canines dead which the sheriff's department investigators concluded likely died on June 20 from suffocation and heat exhaustion after being confined in a small room that measured eight by 12 foot.

The Hughes told authorities that the air-conditioning was knocked out by a dog chewing through an electrical cord, but the investigators could not confirm that. 

In October, the Hughes were  indicted on 22 felony counts, seven misdemeanor counts and one count of fraud, but they were also dismissed in December a part from the count of fraud.

The charges against both couples were dropped because the case presented by prosecutors did not take into account potential problems with the air conditioning unit.

However, the county attorney warned that new charges could be filed against them. 

The one count of fraud remains intact against the Hughes, alleging that dog owners were fraudulently led to believe their pets would be roaming free and playing with the Hughes' children in a spacious backyard. 

Instead, the pets were kept in a 'dog room' that was not shown to prospective customers on tours of the kennel.

When the bodies of the dogs were found, some of the owners claimed that they were initially told their pets had run away.

Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, told ABC that her home would never be the same. 

It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' 

The dog owners claim that they were told the family would only board a few dogs at a time but a police investigation found more than two dozen dogs were in the small room together.

'Our clients were deceived, attorney John Schill told AZFamily. 'They were told their dogs would be boarded at a Disneyland-type facility, where the dogs would run free.

'In reality, it was 28 dogs crammed into a nine-by-twelve [foot] room, where they died.'

As the Flakes file their claim against Maricopa County, one woman whose two dogs died at the kennel is 'shocked' that they are going from suspects to alleged victims.

Valerie Collins said: 'It’s like slapping [the dog owners] in the face. How could this be happening?'

The Flakes' lawyers said that as tragic as this accident was, it was exactly that - a tragic accident, and never a crime.

His statement said: 'There was never probable cause to believe that the Flakes intended for these animals to die,or that the Flakes had actual awareness that they were going to cause the animals to die and then decided to go ahead and do it anyway.'
