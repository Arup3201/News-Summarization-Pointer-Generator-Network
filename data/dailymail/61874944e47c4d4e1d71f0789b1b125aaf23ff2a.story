Dave Attwood studied physics and philosophy at university, so when he is throwing his weight around in the colours of Bath, he has a fundamental grasp of the attitude he must adopt.

Playing on the edge, but not over it; that is the key. He already knew the theory and over time – via a couple of jolting reminders – he has learned to apply it. The 27-year-old lock is intelligent, a deep thinker and an assured talker. He is armed for a debate, as well as for the gruelling demands of his day-job.

Having made a storming start to the new Aviva Premiership season and a strong case for England recognition, Attwood considers the extremities of his role. He may have lost a few pounds, but his brief is to impose himself on the opposition. In the past, he has occasionally over-stepped the mark in that regard and the tag of ‘enforcer’ has duly been applied.

Most occupants of the second row would embrace it, but Attwood is wary. ‘I think the connotations of it are the difficult thing,’ he said, ahead of Sunday’s showdown with Wasps and their leading England lock, Joe Launchbury.

‘The term “enforcer” harks back to an era when rugby was a very different game; when a bit of shoe on someone’s shoulder was completely acceptable. Rugby has changed and I am testament to that. Rugby is a different game to when I started playing and you have to adapt to that.

‘The trouble with the term “enforcer” is that it harks back to an era when that sort of player ran round grabbing people by the face and throwing them around, or laying down the law under the cover of a ruck or scrum. That doesn’t exist anymore and you can’t do that.

‘There’s no real benefit either. People are so professional these days that putting in a bit of a cheap shot on someone doesn’t really make a difference and you risk getting yourself cited and banned. So it’s a difficult term, but I do think there’s a place for it, in terms of being someone who takes a lead when it comes to physicality. That is definitely something I aim to do.

‘You have to impose yourself, without doing it illegally – put in a big tackle, then get up and do another one. When your defensive line is pushing the attack back, pushing the attack back, pushing the attack back; you have to be the guy leading the charge. If anyone was to use the term “enforcer” about me; that is what I would want them to mean.’

Back in June, 2010, when England were on tour in Australia, the uncapped Attwood made a major impression on the-then national manager, Martin Johnson. The former lock-enforcer saw the rookie as an emerging talent in his own image, but since then he hasn’t quite taken the next step to become a fixture in the Test pack.

To date, he has earned 12 caps but started just twice for his country, on tour in Argentina last year while the Lions were in Australia. His status as a regular replacement appeared to be under threat on the recent trip to New Zealand, as Ed Slater made a positive impact as midweek captain, but the Leicester skipper has been ruled out for the season and Attwood had been outstanding for Bath.

When his club smashed the Tigers 45-0 at The Rec last month, he was bloodied and brilliant, in front of watching England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, and he has maintained supreme standards, thanks in part to more mobility. ‘They (England coaches) want the same explosive qualities, but they want us to be a bit lighter and fitter,’ he said.

‘After the Argentina tour last year, the feedback from England was, “We want you big, strong and as effective as you can be in a five-metre square. Now the emphasis has shifted; they still want me to be destructive, but also get my numbers up. That is going well for me so far – I’ve made a fairly good account of myself in the early part of this season. 

‘I am a very good scrummaging second row – one of the best scrummaging second rows around. It is great for me to be working with David Wilson, who is one of the best tightheads in Europe at the moment. So I have that string to my bow, but for the last Test in New Zealand I was weighing around 127kg and now I’m about 119. I’m trying to get around the pitch a bit more.’

Sunday’s game at Adams Park will act as another momentous examination of his Test ambitions. In recent weeks, Attwood has thrived in match-ups with Geoff Parling and Courtney Lawes, now Launchbury is on his radar. He is driven, but wary of being side-tracked by a personal agenda. ‘You can’t just run round the pitch, following the guy, saying, “I’m coming after you!”,’ he said.

‘I think I’m on a good road. I’m not the one holding the shirt – I’m chasing someone else’s shirt at the moment. I’m third or fourth or fifth choice, but I’ve got a possibility of getting hold of it. I do feel like there’s an opportunity for someone with my skills-set to be a reigning England second row.’

His superb form has come in the build-up to becoming a first-time father. He senses he is entering a critical phase, in various ways. ‘It may be coincidental that things are going particularly well with Bath so far this season, the World Cup is looming, we’ve got a baby on the way and I’m on the verge of getting established in international rugby,’ he said. There’s an awful lot going on at the moment.

‘I’m very excited and aware that I’m on the cusp of a life-changing period.’
