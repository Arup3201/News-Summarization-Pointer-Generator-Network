Young Britons should think about the ‘destructive’ impact on their families before travelling to Syria, Theresa May warned today.

The Home Secretary issued a blunt messaging declaring ‘don’t go to Syria’ as she backed a campaign highlighting the effects on communities in the UK when people join jihadist militants.

More than 400 people are thought to have left Britain for Syria and Iraq to join rebel fighters, sparking fears they will become radicalised to launch terror attacks when they return home.

A new nationwide campaign - Families Matter – was launched today by not-for-profit organisation Families Against Stress and Trauma (Fast) to urge people to stop their relatives from travelling to join the conflicts.

Mrs May said: ‘This campaign addresses one of the most significant issues facing communities up and down Britain – the extremely damaging effect of young people choosing to travel to Syria and now Iraq.

‘While many may be motivated by a desire to help the country, the result and impact on these people, their families and often on the communities they are trying to support is very destructive indeed.’

Several high-profile incidents have led to a national effort to prevent young people travelling to Iraq and Syria.

Last month two men from Cardiff and a man from Aberdeen featured in an online recruitment video urging western Muslims to join the fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (Isis) group.

Mrs May added: 'I am clear, in relation to people who are going to Syria and returning as terrorists, the Government will take action.

'Over 400 UK-linked individuals have now travelled to Syria since the uprising began. Anyone travelling to Syria and Iraq is exposing themselves to serious risks and the Government strongly advises against it.

'Providing a campaign called Families Matter is about supporting the families. Remember the family and the stress and trauma it causes when someone travels to Syria. The message is don’t go to Syria - there are better ways to help.

'The best way people can help respond to the crisis is from the UK within the UK and within the safety of their families and communities.

Nasser Muthana, 20, Reyaad Khan, 20, and Abdul Raqib Amin, 26, appeared in the video and are thought to be among more than 400 Britons fighting in Syria and Iraq.

Nasser’s father Ahmed, who appeared in a Fast campaign video and whose other son Aseel is also in Syria, said: 'Nasser was going to be a GP. We expected a high life for him. He was the best of the best but unfortunately he chose to go with these wrong people.

'I think ‘am I going to see him alive again?’ Maybe we won’t even see the coffin - we’ll just see on the news they’re dead.'

The Home Office has stepped up measures to act as a deterrent, including prosecuting some of those who come back as terrorists.
