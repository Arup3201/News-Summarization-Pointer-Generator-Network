Hundreds of Jewish graves have been desecrated in a 'heinous anti-Semitic attack' in France.

The country's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the attack happened at the main Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union, in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace, on the German border.

Up to 400 gravestones were vandalised by being kicked over, or had Nazi swastikas daubed on them in red paint.

'Odious act': France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve (at the site of the Copenhagen attack yesterday) said the country would 'not tolerate this latest attack which harms the values all French people share'

Mr Cazeneuve said: 'This was an odious act against religious freedom and tolerance. France will not tolerate this latest attack which harms the values all French people share.'

The incident follows the murder of four Jewish people by a Kalashnikov wielding terrorist following a siege in a Paris Kosher store last month.

Mr Cazeneuve said 'everything will be done to establish the identity of the perpetrators' of the Sarre-Union attack 'so as to bring them to justice'.

Manuel Valls, France's Prime Minister, joined in condemning the 'vile anti-Semitic act', and also pledged that the criminals responsible would be brought to justice.

Many of the Jews buried in Sarre-Union were linked with the Second World War Holocaust, when some 76,000 French Jews were entrained to their deaths in German concentration camps.

Police response: A gun attack on a synagogue in Copenhagen left one Jewish man dead this weekend

Massacre: The Charlie Hebdo atrocities in Paris saw 20 people die, including the three terrorists responsible

Philippe Richert, UMP President of the Alsace Regional Council, said it 'was too early to say' who might be responsible for the Sarre-Union attack, but confirmed that police were 'flooding the area'.

The Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union has been attacked in the past - 54 graves were desecrated there in 2001, and 60 in 1988.

Alsace is an area with a terrifying history of anti-Semitism, with pograms - organised attacks against Jews - regularly taking place there in the Middle Ages.

In 1940, during the Second World War, Alsace was annexed to Germany, and 2605 Jews from Bas-Rhin alone were murdered during the Holocaust.

Neo-Nazis still living in the area have been linked with regular attacks on Jewish sites, including cemeteries.

Today's damage was first reported in the middle of the afternoon by a number of visitors to the cemetery. A criminal enquiry was launched soon afterwards.

A gun attack on a synagogue in Copenhagen left one Jewish man dead this weekend, as Jewish leaders complain of a rising tide of anti-Semitism.

The Paris attack in January was part of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine atrocities, in which a total of 20 died, including the three terrorists responsible.

All were radical Islamists furious at Charlie Hebdo publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but they also made clear that they wanted to kill Jews.

Linked with Al Qaeda and Islamic State, they said they wanted to take 'revenge' for Israel's war against Arab neighbours in the Middle East - particularly Palestinians.

The Paris attacks led to security being stepped up at synagogue and other Jewish sites across France.

Three soldiers were attacked by a knife-wielding thug linked with Islamic terrorism in the Riviera city of Nice earlier this month too.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, has said the situation is now so bad that European Jews should immigrate to Israel.
