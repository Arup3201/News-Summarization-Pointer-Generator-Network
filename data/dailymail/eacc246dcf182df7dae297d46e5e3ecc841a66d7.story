A coroner says a 79-year-old hunter found dead in the western Pennsylvania woods accidentally shot himself with his own rifle.

The body of James Turnbull, of White Township, was discovered by another deer hunter shortly before 5 pm Wednesday in a wooded area of the township.

Indiana County Coroner Jerry Overman Jr. says in a news release Thursday that, 'Foul play or involvement by another hunter has been ruled out.'

What's unclear is how the gun went off.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission, state police and the coroner were continuing to investigate.

White Township is about 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

A similar tragedy occurred just last month in neighboring New Jersey where authorities say a goose hunter who was out with his father died after he accidentally shot himself in the head and neck.

The victim, identified only as a 45-year-old Chesterfield man, was pronounced dead at the scene. The father apparently was not injured.

Authorities say the two men were hunting by themselves and had Canada goose decoys spread out in front of their blind. They said both men were properly licensed to hunt the birds. 

And in Maine, wardens say that days before a 30-year-old Mattawamkeag man shot himself in the arm and torso when he lost his footing along a riverbank, causing his rifle to discharge.

Wardens say Aaron Burke was in serious condition after being shot Thursday morning. Wardens say he was hunting deer along the Mattawamkeag River when he slipped, causing his 30-30 rifle to discharge.

Wardens say he managed to climb a riverbank and make his way out of the woods to call for help.
