Chelsea failed to win for only the third time in the Premier League season as Sunderland held Jose Mourinho's men to a goalless draw at the Stadium of Light.

The draw sees Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the table ahead of Southampton, who play third-placed Manchester City on Sunday.

Sportsmail's Craig Hope rated the players' performances at the Stadium of Light.

Sunderland (4-1-4-1)

Costel Pantilimon 6

Didn’t have a save of note to make as the big Romanian made it back-to-back clean sheets.

Santiago Vergini 7

One piece of showboating – taking out two Chelsea players –thrilled the home crowd and he clipped the bar in the first half. Handled Hazard well.

John O’Shea 7

Great recovery to deny Costa certain goal in first half. Was resilient and kept Chelsea’s main man quiet. A captain’s display.

Sunderland's Lee Cattermole (left) snapped through challenges from the first minute until last

Wes Brown 6.5

Was part of admirable rearguard action as he and O’Shea used their experience to organise and repel the threat of the league leaders.

Anthony Reveillere 7

Continues to impress since free-transfer arrival and looks a class act.

Lee Cattermole 7.5

Tigerish and snapped through challenges from the first minute until last. Collects North East Football Writers’ Player of the Year award on Sunday night and, on this evidence, he is a worthy winner.

Adam Johnson 5

Disappointed yet again. Really has regressed as a footballer. No power or explosion left in his body. At 27, it is a waste of a talented footballer. Lucky not to be booked for early dive.

Seb Larsson 6.5

Disciplined without being spectacular and played his part in gaining the point.

Sunderland forward Connor Wickham was a constant menace against Chelsea

Jack Rodwell 6.5

Showing signs of improvement after sluggish start to season. Nipped by opponents on couple of occasions and was strong in the tackle.

Connor Wickham 7

Best attacking threat, escaping down the left on numerous occasions. Was denied by Courtois with stinging drive in second half. Did well.

Steven Fletcher 6

Afforded precious little of the ball but worked manfully before withdrawal midway through second half.

Subs

Jozy Altidore 6. On 62.

Was a handful and might have forced a winner late on.

Jordi Gomez 6. On 62.

Kept up the pressure on Chelsea midfield. 

Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell was up for the challenge against Chelsea

Chelsea (4-2-3-1)

Thiabut Courtois 6

A spectator for the large part but did what he had to do with minimum fuss.

Branislav Ivanovic 6

Strong, as ever, but was outdone by Wickham once or twice, but at no great cost.

John Terry 6.5

One of his easier outings and, like the rest of the back four, watched on for the majority.

Gary Cahill 6

Much like Terry, although Altidore did cause him one or two problems late on. 

Cesar Azpilicueta 6.5

Had a comfortable evening against Johnson and showed a willingness to join the attack when possible.

Nemanja Matic 6.5

Strode through the game with a cigar from that deep-lying role but also tried to probe defence as game wore on. 

Frustrated Chelsea striker Diego Costa was fortunate to escape a red card

Cesc Fabregas 6

Saw a lot of the ball but did little with it. Just could not produce that killer pass.

Oscar 5.5

Ineffective and struggled to come up with anything to break down Sunderland resistance.

Eden Hazard 6

Flattered to deceive at times when seeing a lot of the ball in and around the area, although, like his team-mates, he failed to penetrate.

Willian 7

Was Chelsea’s best bet for creating something in final third but his trickery ultimately came to nothing.

Diego Costa 5.5

Frustrating game and he was fortunate not to see red for a petulant first-half kick at O’Shea. Looked off the pace.

Subs

Loic Remy 6. On 76

Didier Drogba 6. On 76

Andre Schurrle. On 85
