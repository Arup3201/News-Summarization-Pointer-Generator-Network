European Parliament president Martin Schulz was at the May 9 meeting

Seventy-six Eurocrats spent part of a top-level meeting deciding what to name a corridor - and even failed to reach a decision, it has emerged.

This was even though a name had already been proposed and just needed signing off.

In a shocking example of Brussels wasteful bureaucracy, the decision over the naming of one of the corridors in the Altiero Spinelli building had to be referred to a committee.

Critics have branded it another example of how 'detached from reality' Eurocrats are.

The request had been made to name the corridor 'The Baltic Way', after a peaceful 1989 mass protest against Soviet Rule, minutes of the May 9 meeting showed.

European Parliament president Martin Schulz was even present at the Bureau meeting.

But bungling officials could not come to a conclusion and passed the issue on to a committee who have been told to report back.

Tory MP Philip Davies said the Eurocrats were 'detached from reality'.

Head of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage told The Sun: 'This is straight out of TV's Yes, Prime Minister. It's about fighting over support of a couple of Baltic MEPs.'

In June it was revealed how it cost nearly half a million pounds to send five Eurocrats to the Earth Summit in Rio.

The European Commission said it cost £475,000 to send officials, including their president José Manuel Barroso, along with an entourage of over 60 to the Rio+20 conference.

The high financial costs were revealed in an answer to a parliamentary question submitted by London Conservative MEP Marina Yannakoudakis.

Mrs Yannakoudakis, who is a member of the European Parliament’s environment committee, condemned the decision to send such a large delegation.

She said: 'The Rio+20 Summit may address important issues, but the EU needs to be mindful of the costs of sending so many officials halfway across the world.

The Altiero Spinelli building in Brussels in which Eurocrats were asked to name a corridor, however, they failed to come up with a solution and referred the matter to a committee and asked for a report back

'At a time of austerity, we must ask ourselves was it really necessary to send five European Commissioners and their entourages to Rio. Saving the planet shouldn’t cost the earth.'

Earlier this year it was also revealed that Baroness Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, was among one of the Eurocrats eligible for the use of private jets to fly them to meetings around the world.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council, are among other dignitaries who will benefit from the agreement with Belgian firm Abelag.

At a cost of £10million for the next four years, they are able to use a choice of aircraft, including the Falcon 7X jet and Boeing 737, when they travel abroad for EU business.

Peaceful demonstration: The Baltic Way's human chain

The Baltic Way - which has also come to be known as the Baltic Chain or Chain of Freedom - was a peaceful political demonstration that took place on August 23, 1989.

An estimated two million people across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - which at the time were part of the Soviet Union - joined their hands to form a human chain more than 370 miles long.

It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany, which split up Eastern Europe and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940.

The protest, organised by Baltic pro-independence movements, was designed to bring the issue of independence to global attention.

The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to claim that the Soviet occupation was illegal.

Within six months, Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.
