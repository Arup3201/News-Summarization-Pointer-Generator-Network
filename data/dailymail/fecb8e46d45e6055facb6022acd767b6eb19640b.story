MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

If Malky Mackay wanted to be rehabilitated, he should have chosen his next chairman more carefully.

He finds himself back in football alongside an employer who did him no favours on Wednesday.

In 2011, Dave Whelan gave a radio interview to LBC about the high-profile racism cases involving John Terry and Luis Suarez. Asked for his view on black players who take issue with being racially abused on a football pitch, he said: ‘You know, I think the players who come and complain sometimes, they’re a little bit out of order.’ He added: ‘If they call somebody black, you’ve just got to get on with it’.

On Wednesday Whelan, now 77, appeared every bit as out of touch when it came to the issue of his new manager and an exchange of racist, sexist and homophobic text messages and emails that remain the subject of an ongoing Football Association investigation.

As out of touch as the LMA when they dismissed Mackay’s exchanges with Iain Moody as ‘banter’, only to then apologise for the original apology.

Whelan said Mackay had been ‘unlucky’ and had ‘done a little bit wrong’, adding that the football club had endured ‘these little problems’ in the past before finally declaring the FA investigation would probably come to nothing.

Every bit as offensive and patronising was his dismissal of Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP who wrote to Whelan last week echoing her constituents in expressing concern about Mackay’s possible appointment. ‘She’s not a Wigan girl by the way, she was imported into Wigan from another area, she’s not a Wigan lass, so she doesn’t understand football,’ he declared.

The truth is, no club should have even considered appointing Mackay while he remains the subject of such a serious investigation; one that remains two or three weeks away from completion.

While Whelan says there is a clause in Mackay’s new contract that gives the club the right to take action should he now be charged, he already seems to think no action will be taken.

Whelan is being as disingenuous as the man who continues to insist he has already apologised for those text messages and emails.

During that apology in a staged interview with Sky, Mackay said he was responsible for only three offensive text messages or emails.

But he did so knowing full well there were more - and the following morning those messages were published on the pages of the Daily Mail.

One of them referred to Vincent Tan, his Malaysian former employer at Cardiff, as ‘a chink’.

Another ridiculed a gay Watford season-ticket holder for feeling intimidated by homophobic chants during a match against Brighton.

Mackay has not apologised for those messages and until he is asked to explain himself by an independent FA tribunal, it is hard to see him getting any closure on the matter.

There is a real desire among the FA’s senior officials to see Mackay charged even if there remains a major problem over this issue of public and private communication.

When Greg Dyke said ‘the FA does not consider private communication sent with a legitimate expectation of privacy to amount to professional misconduct’ in reference to the recent Richard Scudamore controversy, he created a problem for the disciplinary officials now examining the Mackay case.

But if Mackay’s appointment amounted to an embarrassment for English football, it will be nothing compared to the FA’s failure to take action against the new manager of Wigan.

Not least because men like Whelan and Mackay will feel vindicated if he escapes censure.

Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League'

May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.

May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon - causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters.

April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment.

October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds.

December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers.

December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’.

December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan.

December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.
