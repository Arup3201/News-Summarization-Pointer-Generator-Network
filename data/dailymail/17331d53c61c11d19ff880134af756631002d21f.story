A Premier League footballer's son was one of two boys expelled from a leading public school after they allegedly stabbed 15 other pupils with a used needle, causing an HIV scare.

The pair, both 14, were dismissed from the school in south England after claims they found a used diabetes pen, which normally tests levels of glucose in the blood, belonging to a pupil before attacking their classmates with it.

School authorities alerted the police and public health officials, who recommended that the students be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, it is claimed.

Fifteen pupils at a leading public school have been tested for HIV after they were allegedly stabbed with a needle used by diabetics to test the level of glucose in the blood by two 14-year-old pupils 

The father of one of the expelled pupils is a star with one of the country's top football clubs, according toThe Sun.

The shocking incident happened last month when the teenagers jabbed their classmates in a prank gone wrong.

They used the needle of the diabetes pen, believed to have been left behind by someone with the condition, which is usually used to test levels of glucose in the blood.

Teachers immediately called the police and public health officials, with affected students undergoing emergency tests.

The police took no further action but the boys were expelled.  

A spokesman for the school said: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at the school last month involving a diabetic testing pen.

'The incident was extremely concerning and as soon as we became aware of it all parents of pupils involved were contacted immediately and given the advice received from public health experts. 

'While the risk of infection was low or negligible, children affected were advised to have blood tests all of which proved negative.'
