A house that lacks running water and sits on top of a mountain two kilometres from the nearest road wouldn't be many people's idea of a dream place to live but for Steve Lao, 69, it's paradise.

The Oxford-educated son of a former state governor, Lao swapped a privileged life in the upper echelons of Indian society and a career as an elite fighter pilot for a hand-to-mouth existence in Uttaranchal in northern India.

He lives with wife Parvati in a home that lacks any sort of mod con, including a shower, and sees his children, both of whom moved away, less than once a month.

But Mr Lao says he has no regrets and instead, says his remote 34-acre estate, Gilling, is the only place he could imagine living.

'Being what I've always been, an 
individualist, I'm unsuitable... I can't live in an organised society,' he explains.

'And it's not that I'm evil or bad - I just can't live in that sort of nine to five 
environment. And then to have something of your own, to have that 
freedom... That's what I like.'

Lao and his wife Parvati have lived on the estate for 33 years and had nothing at all when they first arrived.

Over years, the couple built themselves a home on the site of what used to be cowsheds and live on just Â£3,000 a year - money they raise through farming and by renting out a pair of small cottages to passing hikers.

Mountainous: Steve's home is 6,500ft above sea level and is two kilometres from the nearest road

Basic: The couple's home, which they built themselves, has no running water and cooking is done outside

One such visitor is Ben Fogle, who spends a week with Mr Lao and his family as part of his new series, New Lives in the Wild.

'You can't open the fridge and get out a
 bottle of milk,' he observes of Mr Lao's unusual set-up. 'You have to come down here and milk the cow or, in this
 case, a buffalo.'

Although the house now has electricity, there is no running water, no internet and no central heating -  not pleasant when the temperature dips below zero as it regularly does in winter.

Nevertheless, Mr Lao, whose hobbies include spending time alone naked in the wild ('The feeling of wearing no clothes is very liberating to me!') and refurbishing old motorbikes, says that the tough daily slog is well worth it.

That slog begins at dawn when the couple get up to milk their seven cows before knuckling down to farm work.

Top of the world: Steve and Parvati's home is so remote, getting to the nearest major city takes nine hours

Fun times: When he's not farming, Steve is indulging in his other passion - restoring old motorbikes

Mr Lao also conducts regular patrols around the estate, much of which is forested, in a bid to keep wood-pinching locals from the nearest village at bay.

It's a far cry from his early life, spent in luxury with his affluent parents, and his fighter pilot career, which saw him take to the skies in Hawker Hunter and MIG 21 jets and fight in two wars.

But in 1974, Lao, who had already been subjected to three court martials for refusing to accept orders, was kicked out of the air force for good - much to the horror of his father.

'My father was horrified because he was a
 pretty conservative sort of chap,' he explains, his English still retaining traces of his very British education.

'But I said to him, "Dad, you took a 
lot of bullsh** when you were part of the Defence Ministry but I speak 
out which is slightly different from you." So he was able to keep his 
mouth shut - I could not.

'And
 then I met this exceptional woman, Parvati,' he continues. 'She's a woman without any 
education, this, that and the other but there was something inborn in 
her so we fell in love.

'And I told my father and my father said: "Oh dear, this is not on dammit!" I said "Dad, 
what's the problem? You should be a better Christian!" and then I left.

'I
 took my guns and put them over my shoulder, I met her father down below
 and said "give us your blessings, we're off!" and that was it.'

But it wasn't long before Lao's father, worried about the fate of the family's Gilling estate, got back in touch.

'Then the shit hit the fan and they said "Son! Can you come here?" [to Gilling] and like a good son, I came.'

More than 30 years later, Lao is still there and still farming despite having to deal with challenges such as arthritis and the depredations of local leopards.

Threat: Steve says that four or five leopards live close to his mountain eyrie as well as parrots and monkeys

Happy: Steve and his wife Parvati have no plans to change their home, despite advancing old age

'There are around four to five around 
here in this area,' he reveals. 'There are many incidences of leopards catching 
children, catching women, catching men...'

His two children, Richard and Nandoni, were brought up on the estate themselves, although educated in Delhi at the behest of his parents.

While Lao is bullish about most aspects of life in the wilderness, he does admit that there were moments when he worried about what might happen to them.

'In reality, there were moments with a 
lot of self-doubt and uncertainty,' he says. 'My main worries were the education 
and the sort of society they would grow up in.'

With both now in their 30s, Lao's latest worry is what will happen to the estate after he's gone so to make life easier for his children, he's taken preparations in hand - including digging his own grave.

'Would be bloody funny if I kicked the bucket now,' he quips as he shows Fogle the waiting tomb.

'Welcome to my grave! This was dug many, many years ago,' he adds. 'I said: "Let's be prepared for these things"!'

Satisfied with life: Steve says his only regret is not flying his fighter plane over the farm

With his grave complete, he says his only worry left is whether his two children will be able to keep the estate intact after his death.

'In this day 
and age with things all around us, slowly breaking up, you know law and 
order and things like that, that's my only worry.

'How are they going to 
look after this with people trying to make inroads and things like this?'

Despite the challenges of life on a mountaintop and the uncertainty about what will happen after he's gone, Lao says he's missed out on nothing.

'The
 only regret I have is that I never flew my fighter plane over my own 
farm,' he chuckles. 'I've flown the length and breadth of India but never here. That's 
my only regret.'
