It seems barely big enough to swing one cat in, but this run-of-the mill mid-terrace property is home to 20 of them.

The cats have had the run of this modest £105,000 property – cared for by a team of visiting volunteers - since owner Shirley Maynard was admitted to hospital in 2011 when her health began to fail.

But their future at the property is now under threat after the volunteers discovered the childless pensioner’s will makes no provision for the cats continued care at the address.

Animal lovers: Michael and Shirley Maynard set up a charity for cats in their home

Dana Demidoff, one of the 20 volunteers who visit on a rota basis to clean, groom, feed and play with the cats, said: ‘It’s a worrying time for us. We know that Shirley cared very deeply for the cats and that’s why she set up this charity in her own home. But legalities might force us to close.

‘This house is a safe haven for elderly or poorly cats who live their final days in peace and quiet. We come in and look after them.’

No room to swing a cat: Twenty cats have been allowed to take over the three bedroom property

Mrs Maynard, 77, who is now thought to be in care, began taking in elderly and ill cats in the 1980s with husband Michael and officially registered their three-bedroom property as a charitable hospice to care for the animals 16 years ago.

Under threat: The cats have been allowed to live at the property since 2011

At one point the address was home to as many as 90 waifs and strays.

But following Mr Maynard’s death in 2008 at the age of 74, his widow’s health began to deteriorate and the volunteers formed a board of trustees to manage the Maynards’ St Francis Hospice for Cats.

The trustees have recently discovered that Mrs Maynard’ will does not leave the house to the cats and, although they believe it was her wish for the home in Littleover, Derby, to continue as a cat sanctuary, she is now too ill to make changes to her bequest.

Mrs Demidoff, who is also a trustee, from Breadsall, Derby, added: ‘We have decided not to take in any more cats until we know more.

‘We think Shirley would have wanted to leave the hospice to the cats but maybe she didn’t get round to making her wishes known.

'Now she’s not well enough.’ Mrs Maynard grew up in Derbyshire and worked as a laboratory assistant.

She married her husband, who had been posted in the area during his RAF service, in 1955.

The pensioner was inspired to start taking in cats after working as a volunteer with the Cats Protection League and the RSPCA.

Together with her husband, she even extended and converted parts of the house to make it more feline-friendly. Many of the cats the Maynards have cared for down the years have suffered from the feline version of HIV – FIV.

Sanctuary: The house has been filled with pet toys and scratching posts and at one point was home to 64 cats

Since Mrs Maynard moved out of the house, valuable furniture and electronic equipment such as the television have been removed, leaving more space for pet toys and scratching posts.

Cat beds are scattered throughout the property, with the kitchen used as a wash room to clean bedding and blankets.

Upstairs, the Maynards’ furniture has been taken away with the space now used as a store area for cat food and medication.

The floor is tiled to help keep the place clean and there are cat beds and toys around the house.

The charity costs around £30,000 to run annually – with much of the cost going on vets’ bills and medication - surviving on donations from cat lovers around the world who have read about its good work through the hospice’s webpage.

Caring: Volunteer Gill Andrews (pictured) visits four times a week to keep the house tidy

Volunteer Gill Andrews visits four times a week to keep the house tidy. After checking all the cats are OK, she reads the note left by the last volunteer, feeds all the cats, empties their litter trays and then does some cleaning before grooming and playing with the cats.

Mrs Andrews, 46, from Belper, Derbyshire, said: ‘The cats love it when I brush them.

‘I try and get everything done and then I find time to sit with them and give them some love.’

Vet Abdul Rehman, practices at the nearby Blagreaves surgery and performs regular house calls at the addresss. He was ‘too busy’ to comment yesterday.
