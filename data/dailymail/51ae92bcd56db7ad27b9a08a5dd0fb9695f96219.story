The couple sitting in the audience were clearly in the first flush of romance. Watching them from a distance, there was an almost tangible frisson of possibility about them: the way he put an arm protectively around her back as he led her to her seat; the way her smile twinkled as he leaned in to speak.

Even though I was singing on stage, I was unable to take my eyes off them. Because not only had I brought them together in the first place, but that couple in the audience were my 80-year-old grandmother Patricia and her new 'special friend' Roy Lewis, 75.

Nan, a former seamstress, and Roy, an ex-English teacher, met last year before one of my concerts. Both had been widowed in recent years and become shadows of their former selves.

Second chance: Patricia and Roy have become like happy-go-lucky teenagers since they met

I feared for Nan's health. She'd tried to commit suicide following the death of her husband of 60 years - my grandfather, Ken - and was frail, vulnerable and lonely.

Meanwhile, Roy was a ghost of a man. He'd lost his wife Annette, 72, in 2008 to a stroke after years of her suffering from dementia and was simply struggling to get on with life as best he could.

Neither of them ever expected to find happiness again and thought they were destined to become one of the 2.5 million elderly people in Britain who describe themselves as 'lonely'.

Then fate - and I - intervened.

What greater gift can a granddaughter give to her loving Nan than helping her find love?

Until Roy, I feared there'd never be anyone else, because my grandparents were made for each other.

Nan says she knew the minute she set eyes on my grandfather in 1950 that she would marry him. She was 15, he was 19, and both were hanging out with friends one afternoon in her home town of Reading when he made a kissing noise at her as she walked by.

He was only there for a day trip, having travelled from his home in Walthamstow, East London. They exchanged flirtatious banter, he followed her home that evening and her mother invited him in for tea.

Four years later, they married, moved to London and had my mum, Carole, in 1957 and her sister, Sue, in 1959. A decade or so later they moved to Exmouth.

Like many women of that era, Nan was perfectly happy being the homemaker and wouldn't dream of letting Granddad, an engineer, do any ironing, washing or cleaning. His dinner was always waiting on the table.

The secret of their happy marriage boiled down to one thing - respect. And a kiss and a cuddle every day.

It was in 2008 that we all noticed Granddad was ill. He started refusing to walk into their lounge at home, and it was my mum who realised it was because he was hallucinating and thought there was no floor.

Nan was desperate for him to remain the man he'd always been, the one who would protect and care for her. It wasn't until one night when he 'held her up at gunpoint' using his walking stick and wouldn't let her leave the chair, that she accepted something was seriously wrong.

Granddad was rushed into hospital and diagnosed with dementia. Nan went to pieces. Distraught, she made the first of two attempts to take her life.

When Granddad died two weeks later in February 2010, Nan was in such a terrible state and as frail as a little bird that, in my own mind, I said goodbye to her, too. 'I went with Ken when he died,' she'd say.

Thankfully, she survived and, as a family, we were desperate for her to find peace and happiness again.

First love: Patricia was distraught when her husband, Ken, died in 2010 after suffering from dementia

Little did I know that in March 2012 events were beginning to conspire to lead her to just that.

After watching me perform in Cardiff - I'm a professional soprano and support artists such as Russell Watson - a gentleman approached me in the street to say he had loved my singing. He introduced himself as Roy and bought some signed CDs for his family and friends.

I forgot all about him until a few months later when he sent me an email through my website saying he was going to watch me perform in Hampshire. Sadly, he got stuck in traffic, arriving only after the concert had finished, so I invited him to come for a drink with my mum and me.

Over coffee, Roy told me about Annette, his late wife, who'd been a soprano, too.

They'd met while teaching in the same school - he also worked backstage at the local amateur operatic society where she sang - and married in 1974. They had two daughters, but Annette had died from a stroke in 2008 after battling dementia for 15 years.

It left Roy, who'd never missed one of her concerts, bereft.

When the emotions consumed him, he'd take himself off for drives and walks to try to lift his mood, but he says the first time he felt his spirits lift was when he heard me sing in Cardiff. After that, Roy came to almost all of my shows in 2012. Whenever I sang Mi Chiamano Mimi from La Boheme, Roy would have to reach for a handkerchief to dry his tears.

He later explained that when Annette had been very ill, she'd sometimes suddenly sing that song, word and pitch-perfect. For those few minutes, he said, it was like having the old, lucid Annette back.

Nan also came to many of those concerts as she'd always been my biggest fan. One afternoon I introduced them after we bumped into Roy outside the concert hall and I invited him to join us for lunch.

They exchanged basic pleasantries, but I'd never have pushed them further together for fear of putting pressure on them.

Although physically Roy looks nothing like Granddad, lots of things reminded me of him. He's calm and thoughtful, he listens intently during conversations and he's practical. I remember watching once as Nan struggled to open a packet of sandwiches, only for Roy to produce a penknife from his pocket and cut the cellophane for her.

Over the coming months, as they bumped into one another at my performances, their initial pleasantries gave way to enthusiastic chatter. By spring last year, they'd swapped phone numbers and would often call each other for a chat. They bonded over their traumatic experiences of caring for and losing their spouses. 

It was a year ago, in September last year, that they came to a concert together. This was when I spotted them together in the audience. I was thrilled.

Nan is adamant they weren't a couple at this stage. But she didn't need to be asked twice when Roy suggested he escort her ('I couldn't believe what was happening to me!' she said).

Two months later, my hopes of a romance were confirmed. When they arrived to watch me perform in Exmouth, Nan said to me: 'Give me a hug.' Then she turned to Roy and said the same. Despite his blushes, they hugged and kissed cheeks, and Roy declared: 'That was nice.'

'Well, if you feel it, go with it!' responded Nan.

Since that glorious moment, they speak most days on the phone and see each other at least once a week. Nan has confided that they love to share a kiss. And why not? They met when both of them were facing the emptiness of old age and widowhood stretching out before them.

23 million Britons have a close friend or family member with dementia

Nan lives in Devon and Roy in Bristol, but they travel to see each other. They also make regular trips to York to stay with my husband and me.

Both families are thrilled they've found one another; for us, it's wonderful to know Nan has someone as lovely as Roy to look out for her. She says she now has a reason to look forward rather than back.

Nan's the typical doting female - she massages balm into Roy's legs as he suffers with cramps. She notices when he needs to straighten his collar and calls to him to go steady on the stairs. 

Meanwhile, he prints off information about me from the internet and burns DVDs of my performances from YouTube as Nan doesn't have a computer. It's very sweet.

In fact, they behave like happy-go-lucky teenagers. Nan tells me they'll often giggle when sharing a nightcap in a hotel bar before bed - strictly separate rooms! - realising that neither of their families know they're on an impromptu adventure.

Nan seems more content now she has someone to fuss over, and when Roy smiles, it reaches his eyes.

It's still early days but their time is now spent enjoying walks on the beach, fish-and-chip lunches by the sea and leisurely drives through the countryside. And, of course, they remain my most ardent fans.
