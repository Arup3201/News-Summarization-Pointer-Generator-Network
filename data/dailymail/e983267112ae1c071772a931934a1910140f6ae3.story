Danny Rose was not only elated to find out about his first England call-up but relieved, after Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino wound him up by telling him he was being sold.

The 24-year-old was picked by Roy Hodgson for England’s matches with Norway and Switzerland and new Spurs head coach Pochettino broke the news of the impending call-up on Wednesday morning — but took the chance to scare Rose, who recently signed a new five-year deal.

‘The manager texted me at 10 past nine on Wednesday morning and he said “can you come to my office?” I was thinking “what have I done?”,’ Rose said.

‘I went to his office and he sat me down and said “I’ve got something to tell you — we’ve accepted a bid, we’re selling you”. I said “no you’re not”.

‘But then after that he told me he heard a rumour that I might have a chance of being selected.

‘Then later on the England manager called me and he verified it.’

And Rose believes Pochettino is already helping to improve him.

‘Hopefully, if I can stay fit, I might get a chance within the next two games and I’ve got to try to take it if it comes.’
