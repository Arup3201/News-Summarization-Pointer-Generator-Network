Turn the heating up this weekend – it’s going to be colder than Russia.

Parts of Britain could feel as cold as  -11C(12F) with much of the UK chillier than St Petersburg.

An area of high pressure, the so-called ‘Beast from the East’, has sucked in freezing air from Siberia which will cause the thermometer to plunge as low as -6(21F) and even -7C in some areas, the Met Office has forecast.

The 50mph winds forecast for some parts could make it feel as low as -11.

That will make Britain colder than cities close to the Arctic Circle.

Light snowfalls are also possible across much of the east and south while this could spread across the west towards Wales tomorrow.

Met Office spokesman Charlie Powell said temperatures in parts of Scotland were expected to fall as low as -7C overnight.

He added that the ‘majority of the UK’ could expect to see the temperatures drop as low as -2C(28F) to -3C(27F) during the same period, rendering Britain colder than St Petersburg, Oslo, in Norway, and Stockholm, in Sweden, which are all -2C.

The cold weather is expected to last until next week, when the Met Office say temperatures will return to the February daytime average of around 6C(43F).

Mr Powell said: ‘Today and Saturday we can expect to see daytime temperatures of around 1-4C (34-39F) across much of Britain.

‘Overnight, because of the light winds and clear skies, the majority of the UK will drop to around -2C or -3C.

‘However, in parts of Central and Northern Scotland we could see temperatures drop as low as -6C or -7C overnight.’

Commuters may be battling through snow again on Friday after showers earlier this month, such as this flurry at Crystal Palace station on February 11

‘Conditions are going to be dry and mostly clear over the weekend.’ When asked about how the wind-chill factor could impact on how cold it feels, Mr Powell added: ‘It’s a very subjective thing. It depends on the person experiencing it, but even a wind speed as low as 20-25mph could make it feel 3-4C colder outside.’

Mr Powell said high pressure has dragged cold air from notoriously cold countries like Siberia into the UK.

However, he warned that mild conditions were not on the way in the near future.

Asked about the forecast for early next week, he added: ‘It will be a bit less cold, we should see temperatures of around 5,6, or 7C during the day.

‘However, overnight it’s still going to be around freezing. There’s certainly nothing mild on the cards.’
