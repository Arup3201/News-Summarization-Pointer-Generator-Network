Police officers visiting a school to talk to children about 'respecting your peers' broke up a playground fight between two pupils using pepper spray.

The two officers were lecturing youngsters when a scuffle broke out at lunchtime between two 15-year-old boys.

One officer then sprayed the painful anti-riot device in the boys' faces - even though no punches were thrown.

A fight broke out between two teenage boys at Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village, pictured, and police responded by using pepper spray

Police today defended claims
the tactic was too heavy-handed saying it was the most appropriate 
means to break up the fight between the two 15-year-old boys.

They said the pepper spray was used 
because physically separating the boys could have 'dislocated their 
shoulders or broken their arms'.

The incident happened at Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village, in Daventry, Northamptonshire on December 3.

Sgt Sam Dodds, from Northamptonshire police said: 'The school invited us in for a week to talk to the students about their role in the school among their peers and in the wider community.

'It also gave us a good chance to try and break down some of the barriers.

'While we were in the school on the Monday a scuffle broke out.

Pepper spray is an  aerosol spray containing oils obtained from cayenne pepper. It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory passages and used as a disabling device.

It is generally used by spraying it directly into an individualâ€™s eyes, forcing them to close them.

The spray gives a burning sensation which will last approximately 30 minutes.

The idea behind the use of a pepper spray is that the receiver suffers from reduced vision and is therefore less likely to approach police in a threatening way.

It was introduced into the UK in 2001 for use by police forces.

But it is illegal for citizens to both bring pepper spray into the UK and to possess it.

Individuals who are caught carrying or using pepper spray can be arrested.

There are many criticisms of the use of pepper spray ranging from the fact that it does not work on all individuals to the suggestion it could cause more damage to the eyes than first thought.

'The two students involved were being kept apart, but it was clear they were not calming down.

'Teachers only have the same powers as the general public have in these circumstance and there was a worry the children or others might be injured, so we deployed parva [pepper] spray.'

A spokesperson for Northamptonshire Police added: 'It was deemed the most appropriate means to split up the two boys.

'Physically pulling away 15-year-old's in they situation could cause injuries to the children - such as dislocated shoulders and broken arms.

'The effects of the spray wear off quickly and there is no lasting damage.'

However, parents of children at the academy school, which caters for pupils aged 3-19, yesterday gave a mixed reaction to the police officers' actions.

A mother-of-two, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I thought pepper spray was only used in extreme circumstances - not on young teenagers.

'It was a heavy-handed tactic and a bit over the top I believe.'

Another parent added: 'It'll teach them a good lesson. They won't do it again in a hurry will they?'

Headteacher David Howell said: 'It's not a situation we'd normally call the police in, but given they were here it seemed sensible.

'The good thing was that in the end no one was injured and no punches where thrown.'
