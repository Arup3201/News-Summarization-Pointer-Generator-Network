Construction of a bomb proof wall is underway at a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi erected the concrete wall in front of its college, which houses kindergarten to Year 12 students as well as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen.

Whilst Director Rabbi Dovid ­Slavin has been working towards breaking down barriers, he says 'building walls is the unfortunate reality' in Australia today.

A Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs is constructing a bomb proof wall in front of its college

The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi has erected a concrete wall  which is home students from kindergarten to Year 12

The wall is designed to withstand the force of a car bomb left outside the Jewish centre 

The construction of the wall was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted by the federal government

The construction of the wall was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program, reported the Wentworth Courier.

It is understood the wall, designed with the help from Israeli expertise, can withstand the force of a car bomb outside the centre.

While it is believed the rising anti-semitism in the area prompted the construction of the bomb proof wall, Rabbi Slavin declined to comment further as he has concerns the drastic security measures may add fuel to the fire.

He did however say: 'what we're trying to do is keep the children and the families safe.'

'But our concerns talking about security may compromise what we're actually trying to achieve.'

This being a harmonious community through breaking down barriers.

'Yet building walls is the unfortunate reality,' Rabbi Slavin said.

CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia that it was against policy to comment on security matters.

The Yeshiva Centre was established in 1956 as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen

This comes after a group of teenagers allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August.

Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on  when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm.

Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'.

A more recent incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. 

The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media.
