Thief: Sean Ellis, 19, was facing prison for stealing two gold chains from his grandmother

A teenager who stole from his 80-year old disabled grandmother has been spared jail after she wrote a letter to the judge pleading for his freedom.

Sean Ellis, 19, was facing custody for stealing two gold chains from his grandmother Enice Williams.

He was let off with a community order after Mrs Williams wrote a moving letter saying a prison term would ‘destroy’ both their lives.

Despite the fact that this was the second time Mr Ellis was caught pinching items from the pensioner's home in Wythenshawe, she wrote a letter to the sentencing judge at Manchester Crown Court asking him to spare him.

An extract from the note, read out in court, said: ‘The idea that Sean may go to jail has caused me so much upset and distress that it has affected my health.

‘If Sean was sent to prison, I would be absolutely devastated and this would destroy me and a young lad's life.

‘I only wanted him to get a telling off. It was a second's lapse of judgement and I believe he's sincerely remorseful.’

The judge heard how Mr Ellis had already been banned from Mrs Williams' home, on Baycroft Grove, Northern Moor, for stealing his sister's mobile phone.

On February 14, this year, he returned to the address and stole his gran's jewellery.

The defendant's mum, Anita Hall, who is Mrs Williams's carer, arrived at the house and caught her son inside.

Mrs Williams realised three days later that her two gold chains were missing.

Ellis had already sold one of the chains 
at Cash Generators, but handed back the other. The second item was later
bought back and also returned.

The judge at Manchester Magistrates Court took the elderly woman's letter into consideration and ruled that Mr Ellis be spared jail

Judge Anthony Gee QC told Ellis: ‘You're before the court for the mean offence of theft of jewellery belonging to your 80-year-old grandmother who thinks the world of you.

‘Those who commit offences like this would expect to lose their liberty for a substantial period.’

Leaving court: Mr Ellis will not go to jail thanks to his grandmother's letter

But he added: ‘Nearly any offence of burglary committed in such mean circumstances would expect immediate custodial sentences but there are various reasons here, not least the plea from Mrs Williams.’

The court heard that the defendant admitted his guilt and was remorseful, and also had a medical condition.

Ellis, also of Wythenshawe, was given a 12-month community order with supervision and must carry out 60 hours of unpaid work.

He earlier pleaded guilty to burglary when he appeared at Manchester magistrates' court.

After the hearing Mrs Hall said: ‘My mum wrote the letter because Sean's a really good lad.

‘He's a young lad in debt like a lot of young lads. Just for a second, in a lapse, he got desperate.

‘He took the things back. It's just unfortunate it happened really.’

Judge Gee warned Ellis: ‘Your grandmother hoped that you would only get “a telling off”. Well regard yourself as being told off.

‘But it's more than that. If you breach this order you will be coming back in front of me.’
