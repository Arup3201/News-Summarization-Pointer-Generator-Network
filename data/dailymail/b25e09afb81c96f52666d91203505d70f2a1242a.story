At first glance, these enticing images would make anyone wish their lunch break was just around the corner. But these deceiving pictures of food are actually detailed paintings made to look just like the real thing.

Artist Tom Martin, 26, spends two months carefully working on each intricate and detailed piece, so it looks just like the real thing. Each piece is at least one metre in length and can sell for a staggering £17,000

The
collection of food includes a rhubarb and orange jam while another 
shows a kiwi, an orange and a strawberry arranged together. Meanwhile, a pack of easy cook brown rice and tin of tuna look like they could be served as a meal.

Looks delicious: Artist Tom Martin, 26, has painted a number of food items, which look identical to the real thing, including this bowl of sweets and chocolate

Identical: This collection of sliced fruit looks as delicious as the real thing

Deceiving: To the naked eye, this bowl of cereal and fruit may look real, but it is actually an incredibly detailed painting

He said: 'My paintings represent 
reality, as while I paint I strive to depict what is real to the best of
my ability. I don’t stop until I have achieved that with each of my 
paintings.

'I use 
photographs as a reference to create each piece, but my paintings are 
never just a copy of a photograph. The photo is only used as a reminder 
of what was present at a particular moment in time, so the camera is a 
tool for looking and a brush is a tool for painting.'

The
subject of food was the inspiration for the artist’s new collection, 
who is a keen fitness enthusiast. He continued: 'I focus on food and its
content because it plays a very big part in my life at the moment. I am
a keen fitness enthusiast and along with that comes a healthy diet and 
the science of learning how your body uses carbohydrates and proteins.'

Incredibly, there are no brush marks or textures in the lifelike paintings and the artist reveals using a panel helps him work.

He
added: 'Painting on a panel gives me a solid surface to work against 
and gives the freedom to use a variety of techniques which I couldn’t 
use on a canvas. I typically spend one or two months on each painting.

'It’s dedicated work and long hours - some paintings take less time. Plus
One Gallery took me on straight out of university and they have been my
exclusive representative ever since.'

Expensive: This piece showing a bottle of tomato and chilli oil could fetch up to £14,000 when sold

Essentials: The artist has also tried his hand at painting a tuna tin, easy cook rice and strawberries

Exhibition: Artist Tom Martin is displaying his paintings in London's Plus One Gallery from next month, including this piece of a jam jar, pieces of rhubarb and sliced oranges

Other paintings include a colourful ice cream sundae seems to be placed in a windowsill and bags of mixed sweets and confectionery sitting in a glass bowl.

The lifelike drawings can be seen at the Plus One Gallery in London, where Mr Martin has a solo exhibition from October 9 to November 2.

The talented artist, from Rotherham, South Yorks, applies acrylic paint with a brush and airbrush to a panel made from aluminium or wood.

Attention to detail: Tom Martin spends two months carefully working on each intricate piece

Mouth-watering: This painting of a bottle of olive oil accompanying bread and tomatoes would take around two months to complete
