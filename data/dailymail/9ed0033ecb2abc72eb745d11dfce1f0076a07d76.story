'Murder in slow motion': Stalking can destroy its victims

The world’s first clinic aimed at rehabilitating stalkers to help prevent violent crimes such as murder, rape and sexual assault, will open its doors tomorrow.

Experts behind the National Stalking Clinic (NSC) say stalking, which has been described as 'murder in slow motion', can be stopped through proper assessment and treatment.

The NSC will open at Chase Farm in London and will be run by the by Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust.

Statistics show one in five women and one in 10 men fall victim to stalking, a crime that can lead to murder, rape and sexual assault.

A typical assessment at the clinic will cost between £1,500 and £2,000, which will be met by the referral agencies, which can include courts or probation officers.

Dr Frank Farnham, a consultant psychiatrist and one of the founders of the clinic, said: 'If we can treat stalkers, then we can save lives.

'There is great need for a co-ordinated national service that can provide specialist advice and treatment.

'The psychological impact on victims is corrosive, with many suffering months and, in some cases, years of harassment leading to a variety of illnesses including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.

'Victims live in a permanent state of hyper-alertness which is physically and mentally draining.'

Tragedy: Tricia Bernal with her daughter Clare, who was shot by her stalker in 2005

The NSC will assess stalkers referred by other agencies including the courts, police, probation service and the NHS.

Tricia Bernal said her daughter Clare, may have been spared harrassment if such a clinic existed before the Harvey Nichols beauty consultant was shot dead at the perfume counter of the Knightsbridge store.

Her 22-year-old daughter had been harrassed by her killer for months, even though he had been slapped with a series of restraining orders.

Former store security guard Michael Pech, 30 was on bail awaiting sentence for harassment of his former girlfirend when he murdered her in September 2005.

The Czech-born immigrant then killed himself.

Police, magistrates and the Crown Prosecution Service were heavily criticised for not doing enough in the months before the attack.

Today, Ms Bernal, 56, from Tunbridge Wells, told The Evening Standard,: 'This sort of early intervention really could have helped Clare.

'I'm thrilled this is happening. It's wonderful progress. It's all about early intervention.

'Stalking affects so many people, families are affected for a very long time after.'

Alexis Bowater, chief executive of UK charity Network for Surviving Stalking, said: 'The launch of this clinic is a ground-breaking move and makes the UK one of the world leaders in tackling this devastating crime.

'The treatment and rehabilitation of stalkers is vital if we are to stop lives being lost to stalking.'

Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'I'm pleased to support the launch of this unique clinic that aims to prevent stalkers from reoffending.

Garry Shewan, lead on stalking and harassment with the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Stalking is a crime which steals lives.

'The assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of perpetrators is a vital part of tackling stalking and of preventing reoffending.'

'It would be no more expensive than if a court contacted a psychiatrist, for example, for a report,' said Dr Farnham.

If further treatment was needed, Dr Farnham said an 18-month course could cost between £7,000 and £10,000.

He said it could give courts a cheaper and more effective option than a short prison sentence for stalking-related offences, such as assault.

The overall average cost of a prison place per year is £45,000, according to the Prison Reforms Trust.

'Stalking itself isn't a crime,' said Dr Farnham.

'If people have committed an offence that is more serious they are sentenced in court for that offence.

'It is our experience that individuals get shorter prison sentences that won't make any difference and they go back to stalking.

'We are not going to be taking risks with dangerous people but it gives the courts an option.'

Last month, the Government announced a three-month consultation on the problem of stalking after victims complained of feeling 'let down' by the justice system.

Riley Lison-Taylor, 33, and Jaime 
Perlman, 37, of Putney, south west London, were found dead in a 
fume-filled rented flat just five days after they met on the internet.

In
the hallway were a series of letters in which they hit out at officers 
who investigated their harassment cases, Detective Inspector Glen Lloyd,
of the Metropolitan Police, told Westminster Coroner's Court.

Two-thirds of stalking victims who contacted the police were unhappy with the way the officers or the Crown Prosecution Service handled their cases, according to the Protection Against Stalking report.

The Home Office will be seeking the views of victims and police in their review, due to finish in February.

An inquest last month heard that an escort girl and dominatrix who were stalked by their clients left notes criticising police as part of an online suicide pact.
