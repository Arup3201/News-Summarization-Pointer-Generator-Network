Manchester City face Bayern Munich on Tuesday evening in a Champions League tie they simply can't lose. 

Yet despite the appeal of the reigning champions of Germany and the 2013 competition winners, not to mention the importance of the game in the context of City's season, tickets are still available ahead of kick-off. 

Bayern supporter and blogger Felix Haselsteiner says this situation would be unthinkable in Germany, where the fan is treated with far greater respect. 

It’s all about the quality. Floodlights, Champions League, Bundesliga winners versus Premier League champions.

It’s a scenario every football fan should be eager to experience live. Yet Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium will not be sold out on Tuesday night when Bayern Munich roll into town - an unimaginable scenario from a German perspective.

The Etihad Stadium will host Tuesday's Champions League clash between English champions Manchester City and German giants Bayern Munich - but seats remain available in the hours leading up to kick-off

Felix writes for the Mia San Rot blog here 

Since Bayern Munich moved to the Allianz Arena in 2005 only a handful of games have not been in front of a full stadium. The main reason? The club provides something for everyone.

On the one hand, there is a huge amount of business seats, with cosy blankets and smoked salmon during half-time. These are fully booked by mid-size companies or people who want to enjoy Europe’s best football team without freezing. 

But on the other hand, as a club member you can easily receive tickets for the Kurve. It is here that the ‘magnificent atmosphere’ which Xabi Alonso has praised is created. For a Champions League game, you would pay €30 (£23).

Football fans from Germany simply cannot understand the British stadium and ticket policy. Manchester City’s cheapest season ticket costs €40 (£32) more than the second-best category ticket in Munich. No wonder the difference in terms of stadium atmosphere is so marked.

Xabi Alonso, who joined in the summer, has praised the Allianz Arena atmosphere 

In the Allianz Arena, nobody expects a suit and tie businessman to be cheering loudly for ‘his’ team, this is done by the fans in the Kurve. But if only a certain clientele of people can afford a stadium visit, there simply aren’t enough people to cheer the team on. 

The true British football fan can be found in the pub, where the atmosphere is much better in England than in Germany, but in the stadiums it is the other way around. The Premier League often refers to its high average of stadium visitors, but it is not about quantity, it’s about quality.

Twenty-five years after Hillsborough it may also be the point to admit that safe standing needs to be reintroduced. In nearly every football league worldwide there are no more worries about the safety of terraces. 

The FA and UEFA are birds of a feather when it comes to all-seater stadiums, and it is no wonder that clubs like City suffer as a result. 

Bayern's perennial success means getting a ticket for one of their matches is incredibly difficult

This is the main problem of commercialised modern football: There is no demand for football fans who stand, cheer and push the team to the limits. 

Club executives don’t care as long as everybody wears the new £100 team shirt and consumes enough food and drink. German chairmen also love the revenue, of course, but not for the high price of selling the club’s identity.

From an economical point of view, simply looking at numbers and figures, the Bundesliga should see the Premier League as a role model. In terms of international marketing or TV revenues Barclays’ advertisement league is miles ahead. 

In terms of what makes a visit to the stadium worth watching, though, the Premier League can be jealous of the Bundesliga. Why else would the City fans not be filling their home ground tonight?
