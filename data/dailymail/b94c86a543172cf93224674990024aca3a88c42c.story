In his 85 years behind the wheel, Arthur Whitaker, who has just celebrated turning 100, has clocked up an staggering 2.5 million miles without an accident or traffic ticket.

And the retired engineer from Keighley in West Yorkshire has no intention of taking his foot off the pedal and giving up on his four wheels.

The sprightly centenarian regularly uses his Seat Arosa city car to shuttle back and forth from his golf club.

Arthur Whitaker refuses to take the foot off the pedal

Mr Whitacker began driving before compulsory tests were introduced in 1935 when the minimum age of 17 was set.

With years of driving behind him, he blasted anyone who calls for pensioners to retire from the road, saying they were 'talking bull' 
because he, like many other OAPs, were still capable behind the wheel.

And although car technology has advanced in leaps and bounds since his first car, he still has found memories of the Ford Cortina of which he was the proud owner of half a dozen.

Discussing his only motoring offence, of having one number missing from his licence plate in the 1950s, he said:  'They charged me 7s 6d for that.

Capable: Retired engineer dismisses claims OAPs are unfit for the road as 'bull.'

'I couldn’t believe it and have never forgotten it, there was only one number missing.

'Other than that I’ve had no speeding fines or penalty points.

'I can’t remember how much I pay for my insurance but with 85 years no claims it should be pretty cheap.'

His current wheels of choice, a Seat Arosa is used to commute from his home to Keighley Golf Club where he has been a member since 1957.

He said: 'It’s a good car and I’ve seen a lot of improvements in motoring over the years.

'My all time favourite has got to be the Ford Cortina. I had about half a dozen of them.

Dream motor: The Ford Cortina introduced in 1962 was to become Britain's best selling car in the 1970s

'Almost every job I’ve had involved driving. I used to do 45,000 to 50,000 miles every year as part of my job.

'I don’t do anything like that these days and can do without my car now, but I don’t want to.

'I’m still driving and I’m still capable. There are some clowns on the road though.

'People who say that pensioners shouldn’t drive are talking bull, I am still very comfortable behind the wheel and I’m 100.'

The lifetime of motoring has seen him 
cover over 2,500,000 miles allowing him to have driven around the world 
101 times or to the moon and back five times.

Prized motor: Arthur pictured driving a much loved Volvo 20 years ago.

Arthur spent all his working life as 
an engineer, serving clients in the textile industry working full-time 
until he was 69 and then part-time at an electrical firm until he was 76.

He has lived in Keighley since 1958 and he met his wife, Gwen, at a cafe in the town centre.

He played golf until he was in his early 90s and still goes to the Keighley club for social functions.

A club spokesman said: 'He is a 
regular attendee at our Friday Lunch Club, which celebrated his birthday
with a lunch in his honour.'
