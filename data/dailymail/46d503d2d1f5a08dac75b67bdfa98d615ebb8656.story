Her husband has been the family’s resident artist – until now. Today the Duchess of Cornwall proved she can also rattle off a passable cartoon when the occasion requires.

Camilla was visiting Exeter Library in Devon to open a new facility and promote its Summer Reading Challenge when she was challenged to put pen to paper in front of a group of schoolchildren.

The youngsters from St Leonard’s Primary School had themselves been working with award-winning illustrator, Sarah McIntyre, to create their own imaginary ‘mythical monsters’.

Showing off her skills: Camilla puts pen to paper during a visit to Exeter Library this afternoon

The Duchess was shown a picture of a cartoonish Medusa by Oliver and the Sea Wigs illustrator Sarah McIntyre, who was, appropriately, wearing a fascinator covered in green furry snakes, and asked to draw a naughty sea monkey next to it.

Aides looked slightly askance as the drawing demonstration most definitely had not been part of the planned engagement. 

But giggling Camilla gamely took up a green marker pen and offered up her best effort - complete with large ears, goggly eyes and a slightly toothy grin.

'Here you go,' she said, winking, before finishing the tail off with a flourish.

Standing in the children’s section of the library, which re-opened in May this year after a £4 million refit, she then tapped her foot and nodded her head as Miss McIntyre got out a ukulele and played her a tune about naughty sea monkeys.

Camilla is patron of the National Literacy Trust, Book Trust and First Story, all of which promote literacy in young people.

The Summer Reading Challenge is being rolled out across the country and hopes to reach more than 800,000 young people.

She and her husband, the Prince of Wales, are currently on a three-day visit to the West Country where they are known as the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.

Earlier, they met TV chef turned environmentalist Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall during a visit to River Cottage, although no one there seemed inclined to ask Camilla to draw.
