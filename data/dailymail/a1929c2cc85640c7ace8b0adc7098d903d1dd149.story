Claims: Mass killer Elliot Rodger may have been addicted to Xanax, it has been claimed

Mass killer Elliot Rodger may have been dependent on the anti-anxiety drug Xanax which made him 'isolated and anxious' before his murder spree, it has been claimed.

His family's spokesman previously said Rodger, who stabbed three students and shot another three dead before killing himself, was believed to have been taking the medication for around six months.

Today a police source in Santa Barbara, California, told Radar Online that investigators are 'being told that he was likely addicted to Xanax'.

The source said Rodger's parents, Hunger Games assistant director Peter and his wife Li Chin, had been doing 'basic research' on the prescription drug, whose medical name is alprazolam.

'Based on what they have read, they believe the tranquilizer made him more withdrawn, lonely, isolated, and anxious,' the source said.

The drug's rarer side effects - experienced by more than one in 1,000 patients - include hostility, nervousness, hyperactivity and hallucinations or feelings of unreality.

Despite its use as an anti-anxiety drug, rare side effects for around one in 1,000 patients can include anxiety.

More than one per cent of patients, meanwhile, have trouble concentrating, get confused or depressed or become irritable.

The source added: 'Xanax isn’t being blamed for causing Elliot to go on his rampage, but it probably wasn’t the best decision to have someone like him on it.'

The 22-year-old's use of the prescription drug was revealed after his parents spoke of their 'hell on earth' at knowing the heartbreak he caused in their first formal statement last week.

'We are crying in pain for the victims and their families,' Peter and Li Chin Rodger said in a statement that was read by family friend Simon Astaire.

'It breaks our heart on a level that we didn't think possible. The feeling of knowing that it was our son's actions that caused the tragedy can only be described as hell on earth.'

It is now almost two weeks since their son stabbed three male students in his home - including two of his roommates - before gunning down two female students and another male.

Statement: Simon Astaire, a family friend of Chin and Peter Rodger, read out a statement on their behalf on Good Morning America last week, saying that they are 'crying in pain' for the victims and their families

He explained that they were always worried that their troubled son would kill himself, but after they received his 140-page manifesto - in which he detailed his plan for 'retribution' after girls failed to show any interest in him - on the day of the shooting, they realized that others might be in danger too.

'[Li Chin] read the first four lines and she knew something was wrong,' Astaire said.

She then clicked on his YouTube page and found terrifying videos in which he outlined his plan to 'slaughter' women. She called his father, Peter, from whom she is divorced.

They realised they had to get to Santa Barbara as soon as possible and jumped in their cars. But during the drive, Li Chin heard about the massacre involving a black BMW - the one his mother had bought him - on the radio, Astaire said.

The friend
 added that he had known Rodger most of his life but always thought he 
was an awkward child, who would shake whenever he was approached.

'I
 thought he was the loneliest person I've ever seen in my life,' he 
said. 'He fooled everyone for a very long time. He was a tragic figure. 
He is in many ways a monster.'

He also 
insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert 
the massacre, from taking him to doctors to racing to the campus in a 
bid to stop him.

Since the 
shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with 
Rodger three times while he was living in Isla Vista, but they failed to
 see any warning signs.

On one occasion, a family member called and asked officers to check on Rodger because they were worried about his mental state.

In
 his warped 141-page manifesto, he describes the incident, saying: 'If 
they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended 
everything.

'For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over.... 
[T]he police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and 
weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. 

'I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that.'

But
 Rodger’s parents don't blame the authorities at all. Mr Astaire said: 
'They don't place any blame on the police, because Elliot fooled 
everyone, no one knew the man he was turning into.

'He
 seemed a sensitive guy, there was nothing aggressive about him, there 
was no anger. No one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto. 
He didn’t act in that way, he was just in his own world. He didn’t once 
speak about guns.

'If
 you look at the amount of therapists they took him to, it is clear he 
did all he could. He's writing with anger, but he constantly references 
how they tried to make him feel better.'
