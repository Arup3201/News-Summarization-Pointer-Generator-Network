Two years after a teenage girl died in an bull riding accident in Brandon, Florida, her father is suing the rodeo for negligence.

Brooke Ann Coats, 16, was thrown off the animal during the amateur event at Crosstown Arena on February 18, 2011. The bull kicked her in the chest and the keen rider died just 90 minutes later.

Now Keith Coats has filed a suit against 18 defendants involved with the rodeo, including Corey Costa and his company, Remington Rough Stock Inc, who ran the events.

Tragic: Brooke Coats, 16, died at an amateur bull riding event in Florida two years ago. Now her family is suing the rodeo for negligence

Keith and his wife Susan allege that Costa allowed their daughter to ride an 'aggressive bull above her skill level,' of failing to provide emergency
personnel at the arena, and of waiting at least 15 to 20 minutes to call an 
ambulance after the teenager was kicked.

Coats had been bull riding for about a year as a hobby. Her parents were in the stand on the night the tragic accident happened and had signed a waiver allowing the pretty teenager to take part in the event.

The 16-year-old managed to stand up and 
walk out of the ring after sustaining the massive chest blow, but she 
began complaining of breathing difficulties and later collapsed.

Miss Coats was rushed to Tampa General Hospital, where she died later in surgery. According to the lawsuit, medics determined the kick had lacerated her liver and she bled to death internally.

According to 10 News the rodeo has been shut for sometime and the arena is now for sale.

As noted by the Herald Tribune, the Coats family filed the suit in in Hillsborough County civil court on February 18 - exactly two years to the day of their daughter's death.

The statute of limitations for wrongful death suits in Florida is two years.

Family attorney, Patton Youngblood, told the station that Brooke's parents were devastated, adding 'The family knows that the people there that night did not act quickly.'

'This is something the family will never get over. How can they?' added the attorney.

Another mother, who has been to the arena, told 10 News she was upset by the tragic incident.

'That girl may have survived if the 
ambulance had been there, and it didn't take 10 minutes to get there. 
So, there was a delay in calling,' said Donna Maggiacomo.

Costa has refused to speak to the media since the suit was filed.

Authorities said Miss Coats was wearing a protective vest and helmet when she was tossed from the bull.

In 2011, Costa called Coats' death a 'freak accident.' According to the Tampa Bay Times he noted that the girl had ridden the same bull - a 900-pound, calf - about 30 times.

Tribute: Friends said goodbye to Brooke Coats at the scene of the accident

Shocked schoolfriends placed floral tributes outside the rodeo after learning of their classmate's death. 

Adrian Guzman, who had known Miss Coats since middle school, said: 'I know that bull riding was one of her really important hobbies.

'She really liked that stuff. She was really quiet and really shy, but she was a beautiful girl. She will be missed.'

Others posted messages on a Facebook page set up in memory of Miss Coats. One wrote: 'RIP Cowgirl'.

And her swimming coach, Nancy MacLauchlan, told CF News 13: 'Brooke was a beautiful young woman inside and out. She swam, played tennis, and had a great sense of adventure, and was a devoted friend. 

'No matter what event we asked her to swim, she would put that incredible smile on her face and go out and do it. She never complained at practice, just gave us her every single day. We will miss her terribly.'

Bull riding has been described as the 'most dangerous sport in America'. Riders have to stay on a bucking bull for eight seconds.

The rider does not have a saddle but holds on to a braided rope with one hand.
