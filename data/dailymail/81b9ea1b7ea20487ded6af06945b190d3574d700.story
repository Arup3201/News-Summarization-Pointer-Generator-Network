Samsung is claiming victory in the war of the mobiles after its large-screen Galaxy outsold the Apple iPhone.

In the crucial run-up to Christmas, the South Korean company shifted 700,000 handsets a day worldwide, selling 60million in the final three months of 2012.

Apple sold 47.8million iPhones in the same period – a disappointing figure that saw more than £35billion wiped from its stock market value.

Even though sales rose to record 
levels, Apple missed its targets – causing its shares to plunge by more 
than 10 per cent in one day.

Over just three months, profits  from Samsung’s smartphone and tablet computer division more than doubled to £3.2billion.

One
in three smartphones sold globally in 2012 was made by the company, 
according to ABI Research. Apple, which is based in California, produced
one in five and lost number one spot.

The
Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5 have been battling for supremacy after 
launches last year – with analysts saying the former’s screen size – 
4.8in to 4in – was a key advantage.

The new iPhone also costs more – up to £700 if bought outside a pay-monthly contract compared with £500 for the Galaxy.

Smartphones: Samsung has the success of its Galaxy smartphone to thank for soaring profits

Industry
experts claim Apple has become too focused on high-end, high-cost 
products that consumers cannot – or do not want to – pay for.

And
with the fastest-growing smartphone market shifting  to developing 
economies, the  pressure on price will increase even more.

Shares
in Apple fell again yesterday, and the company has now lost £40billion 
from its market value following its downbeat financial announcement on 
Wednesday night.

‘While 
there is no suggestion that the Apple success story is over it is likely
that the company will have to run that much faster to stand still,’ 
said analyst Michael Hewson from CMC Markets UK. ‘It faces increasing 
competition from its rivals like Samsung, Nokia and Research in Motion, 
meaning the runaway gains of recent years could well be a thing of the 
past.’

In a statement, 
Samsung said the ‘furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone 
market last year’ would be tempered by ‘intensifying price competition’ 
and a ‘slew of new products’.

The
company’s profits between October and December rose 86 per cent to a 
record £5.2billion, with revenues rising 19 per cent to £32.7billion.

‘Samsung’s
got a broader product line-up and Apple appears to be struggling in 
pushing iPhone volumes aggressively,’ said financial analyst Lee 
Se-chul, from Meritz Securities in Seoul, where Samsung is based.

‘Smartphone shipments will continue to grow, even in the traditionally weak first quarter,’ he concluded.

Earlier this week – on the same day Apple posted its poor results – Samsung became the global leader in microchip orders.

And
with Samsung already working on its next phone – rumoured to have a 
paper-like screen – critics say Apple needs to bring out a new creation 
of its own to dazzle.
