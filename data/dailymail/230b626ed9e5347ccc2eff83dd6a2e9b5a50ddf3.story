Conor McGregor dismissed Jose Aldo as 'nothing special' as he revealed he will challenge the UFC featherweight champion in Las Vegas on July 11.

The Dubliner earned his shot with a second-round stoppage of Dennis Siver earlier this month and will headline UFC 189, the climax to the fourth annual Fight Week.

And McGregor insisted the fight would simply be the next step on his road to greatness.

McGregor needed less than two rounds to dismantle Dennis Siver in Boston earlier this month

'This fight means everything to me, but every fight is a world title fight to me, every fight is a main event fight to me,' he said. 'This is just another fight that means everything to me.

'I do not think there is anything special about him. I'm going to smoke him, trust me. And I will go down as one of the greatest of all time.

'Aldo means nothing to me as an opponent. I don't believe it when people say they've been training their whole lives for this particular opponent; I'm training for myself, I'm becoming a better martial artist every day. Aldo is Aldo right now, but come fight time he's just a blank face and a fresh body.

'It’s going to be absolutely phenomenal to have the Irish fans travel to Las Vegas to see me fight. I think they told me the other day that there were 100 million Irish people across the world - that is insane. I tell you, we are all going to descend on the fight capital and take this mother f***** over.'
