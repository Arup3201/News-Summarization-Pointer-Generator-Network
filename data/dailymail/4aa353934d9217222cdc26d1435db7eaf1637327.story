Gary Neville has attacked Manchester United’s bizarre transfer policy after claiming the sale of Danny Welbeck for just £16m is ‘strange’.

United have spent fortunes this summer to sign Falcao, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marco Rojo.

Neville said: ‘It’s not the way I would expect United to go about their business, I thought it would be more controlled.

‘I can’t work it out and I know I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England], but it’s odd. I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me.

‘Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m?

‘How have Arsenal got him [Welbeck] for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly.

‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.

‘Falcao tipped them over the edge, it surprised and shocked everyone. How he gets them in that team I don’t know. How they get Rooney, Di Maria, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Herrera, Januzaj and Mata into that team I don’t know.’

Neville went on to claim United have over-paid for players after their seventh placed finish in the Barclays Premier League last season.

He told talkSPORT: ‘In one sense I am excited because they have signed world class players. People jumped on the bandwagon last year and said they wouldn’t attract players, but they have a massive commercial operation.

‘They have overpaid, there is no doubt about that but people will still go there.’ 

Welbeck is expected to start for Arsenal on Saturday when they take on Manchester City at the Emirates in the Barclays Premier League.

The England striker, who scored twice for his country against Switzerland on Tuesday, admitted he needs a run of games up front to prove he is a top player for club and country.

Arsenal’s £16m signing said: ‘It is well known I prefer to play through the middle so when I get my opportunity I just want to show what I can do. Once I get into the box and getting the opportunities I have got faith in my ability.

‘Before I wasn’t getting into the box because I wasn’t playing too much as a striker and I had to worry about my defensive work. I just know once I get the opportunity and a run of games up front I will do my best.

‘That’s definitely what I need. It is good for any footballer to get a run of games. You become more confident and play much more ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect. That is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it.’
