An anonymous food critic has spent the past two years travelling the UK in hunt of the perfect full English.

The amateur reviewer's opinion has become so well respected that the sought-after stickers he rewards for a good review are being displayed like Michelin stars in restaurants.

The Fry Up Inspector, as he is known as on his blog, rewards restaurants, cafes and tea rooms with a sticker printed with 'Inspector recommended' if he awards the breakfast a score of 8.5 or higher.

A secret reviewer has been travelling the UK sampling Britain's favourite breakfast, the full English. Pictured here, Louis' Deli , Norwich, which received nine out of ten in a rave review

The self-appointed taste tester is no stranger to the full English, having rated over 300 breakfasts from across the country.  

The inspector publishes his reviews on his blog, which has attracted more than 750,000 views since he started it.

The faceless diner started his quest for the perfect breakfast after a particularly bad and overpriced offering at a chain hotel.

Since then, his dedication has seen him post a review complete with his own photos every time he eats his morning meal out. 

The reviewer began his mission in his hometown of Norwich and has since samples fry-ups in London, Northampton, Cambridge, Brighton and Bristol.

His devotion to dining has even lead him to other breakfast items overseas. The hard-to-please reviewer has even sampled  Parisian versions of his favourite morning meal.

The Fry Up Inspector has rewarded twelve of his best reviews to restaurants in his home town of Norwich, such as this one, the Street Cafe, Norwich, which was rated a nine out of ten

Although the inspector has gobbled almost a year's worth of the fried dish he claims that he has maintained a slim physique. 

The middle-aged-man says that he prefers to stick to a diet of fish and steamed veg during the week and only indulges in a fried breakfast at weekends. 

Despite his packed schedule, The Fry Up Inspector squeezes in his day job working with adults with learning difficulties and his reviews serve purely as a hobby.

The critic says that when it comes to a good review it isn't just down to taste, he likes to feel welcomed by the staff and for the restaurant to have a good atmosphere. Pictured here, the breakfast at Bill's, Brighton 8.5/10, which also got a nine out of ten

His success could be down to his involvement in subject as he arguess that so many other restaurant reviews are completely impersonal. 

'I was getting frustrated as other websites reviewing breakfasts had such little information on them.

'I wanted to write something far more detailed to make sure people would know when places were open for breakfast, what was on the menu and what the experience was like.

'I learnt that a lot of people go out for breakfast at least a couple of times a month and with so many places to choose from it can be a bit of a gamble so my blog helps them locate the places that are going to be good.

'I think I must have hit a gap in the market, I do push it on social media, but I think it's also down to growing a fan base.'

The inspector judges each breakfast on six key aspects- first impressions, service, ingredients, presentation, taste and value.

To reach a final score for the breakfast the inspector adds together each individual score for the six elements and averages them out.

When it comes to rewarding a restaurant with a good review he looks for a great atmosphere and friendly waiters. 

'I want simplicity in the ordering process. I also think about the vibe of the place.

'You could have the most amazing breakfast in the world, but if the staff are rude and make you feel like you shouldn't be there then you don't have a good experience.'

Restaurants who receive an 8.5 or more are able to request one of The Food Inspectors much sought after Inspector Recommended stickers

When reviewing taste the critic has a meticulous process and doesn't let any mistake go unnoticed.

'I focus on how it's cooked, anything that's not quite right, items that don't have any flavour.

'My wife prefers a vegetarian breakfast. This is quite handy as I can get a photo of the veggie breakfast too.' 

Restaurants can be sure to expect a negative review if staff are unwelcoming, use crockery that has seen better days or get his order wrong. 

Any breakfast which scores 8.5 or higher means the establishment can contact his blog to ask for one of his circular recommended stickers.

For the Norwich-born reviewer, it appears that when it comes to a good breakfast there is no place like home, with 12 restaurants bestowed with the sticker in his birth town in the past two years. 

His best reviews have dished out compliments such as 'out of this world' and 'cooked perfectly.'

Some restaurants have not received the same flattery and can probably expect a dip in sales being described as 'a sorry sight' and compared with 'chewing on foam'.
