Crisis: Prosecutor Alison Saunders has warned of a rise in children committing domestic violence

Britain's incoming chief prosecutor today warned of an epidemic of children attacking their parents, as it emerged that more than 100 children aged 13 or younger were prosecuted for domestic violence last year.

Alison Saunders stressed that domestic violence does not just involve partners fighting each other, but can see teenagers lashing out against their mothers and fathers.

In 2012-13, more than 2,100 teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 were prosecuted for domestic abuse, underlining the scale of the largely hidden problem.

An 11-year-old boy in London was this year convicted of assault by beating after a court heard that he had punched his mother and thrown a drawer at her while fighting about a phone bill.

A boy of 13 was convicted when his mother refused to give him money to spend on drugs and he threatened her with a knife.

Over the past three years, a total of 8,395 children have been prosecuted for domestic abuse, which includes violence against parents, siblings and girlfriends or boyfriends, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Ms Saunders, who is currently London's chief crown prosecutor but will start work as the new Director of Public Prosecutions next month, blamed the extraordinary amount of abuse carried out by young people on their lack of respect for authority.

She also said that despite the impression of such incidents as being hallmarks of deprivation, they are in fact prevalent in all classes of society.

'One thing about domestic violence is 
that it is not just in dysfunctional families or just the ones on 
benefits, it goes across everyone,' she told the Evening Standard.

'Some of those we see are from really
 badly dysfunctional families, but you also have middle-class and 
upper-class people involved.

'There
 is a lack of respect and a lack of regard for authority. When I was 
growing up the thought of striking a parent was beyond the pale.

'Is
 that peers, is that TV, is that the general environment in the house? 
You are not born to commit domestic violence. It's really about 
nurturing.'

Ms Saunders added that children who are violent towards their family could be encouraged to commit domestic abuse as adults.

'If
 you are starting off hitting your mum then there is not a lot between 
that and hitting your girlfriend, wife, partner when you are older,' she
 said.

This year the 
Home Office ruled that cases involving 16- and 17-year-olds could be 
included in domestic violence statistics amidst fears that such cases 
had previously been wrongly ignored.
