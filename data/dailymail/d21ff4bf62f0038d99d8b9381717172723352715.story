For one bullied teen, revenge is a dish best served laced with semen. Â 

California police are investigating a tenth-grade student who allegedly fed her tormentors cupcakes made with bodily fluids, pubic hair, pills, mayonnaise, soy sauce and expired food.

The girl allegedly passed out the foul baked goods to students at Centennial High School, Bakersfield, who were bullying her.

When the students asked the unidentified girl why the sweet treats tasted so disgusting, she revealed her secret recipe, WPTV reported.

Bakersfield Police Sgt. Joe Grubbs told The Bakersfield Californian that police are treating the incident as a prank following a dispute between students.

He said there is no evidence to suggest bodily fluids were mixed into the cake batter, as the cupcakes were destroyed before they could be tested.

However one student who ate a whole cupcake was too ill to attend school the next day.

Sgt Grubbs added the food contamination incident was 'thoroughly investigated' by Kern High School District police and Centennial High School personnel before Bakersfield police became involved.

Students said the school has now banned outside food from being brought into classrooms, and an upcoming French food day was cancelled.

The school has not commented publicly on the incident. The girl has not been charged.
