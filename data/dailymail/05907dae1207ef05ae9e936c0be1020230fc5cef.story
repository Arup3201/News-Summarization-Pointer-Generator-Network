When people move house they often refer to ‘entering a new chapter of their lives’ or ‘turning a new leaf’. For Jim and Maureen Franks, either expression couldn’t be more apt, as the couple are now leaving a former library they have lived in for almost 40 years.

And it’s not just any old library. Fitzroy House, their Victorian Gothic revival home, was built by the most eminent and fashionable architect of the time, Sir George Gilbert Scott, the man who also created the Albert Memorial, the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras Station and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, all in London.

He was commissioned to build the memorial library for Lewes MP Henry Fitzroy by his widow Hannah in 1862, and it was used by the town until 1958 and later turned into offices.

It then faced demolition in the 1970s before locals moved to preserve the building, and quantity surveyor Jim Franks saw an opportunity to save the structure while turning it into his family home.

But now, in their mid to late 80s, the pair are finding the huge, 2,800 sq ft two-storey home right in the centre of the historic town of Lewes, East Sussex, just a little too much to cope with, and are looking to downsize while staying in the town. Fitzroy House is on the market for offers in excess of £1 million.

‘It was extraordinarily run-down and had been empty for six or seven years,’ says the Frankses’ daughter, Eleanor Austin. 

With her brother and family friends, she helped her parents with the extensive restoration, which was to take five years after they bought it in 1976.

‘There was a tree growing in the area that is now the atrium. My father had to design the new roof and decided on an octagonal glass one that floods the atrium with light. Indeed, we’ve always considered it as our internal garden,’ says Eleanor, a teacher, whose former husband did much of the carpentry work on the renovation.

Creator: Architect Sir George Gilbert Scott

The room she’s referring to is the magnificent 36ft-high octagonal reception room, which has a stunning balcony running around it on the first floor, and a large fish pond as its centrepiece on the ground floor.

‘Yes, that created a lot of debate within the family,’ says Eleanor. ‘Some of us wanted it to be a small swimming pool but my father won that one. But lots of our children have ended up in it anyway, so I suppose it’s doubled up in its use.’

Eleanor’s father kept a weekly diary of his work restoring the library, which he sent to his daughter while she was away at university, and later wrote a book about his work, Building And Saving Fitzroy Library, which is published by Pomegranate Press.

The flexible layout could accommodate four bedrooms. There’s an L-shaped kitchen/diner, four bathrooms, a large first-floor lounge, and various snugs, nooks and crannies, as well as a clock tower and a fabulous 18ft-high entrance hall with original vaulted ceiling, pillars and tessellated tiled floor. 

‘That’s my favourite place,’ says Eleanor, who also lives in Lewes. ‘The ceiling is incredible.’

The house is at the heart of Lewes, on the river Ouse and now part of the South Downs National Park. The town’s world-famous bonfire celebrations happen right outside the front door, with the various societies parading by every November 5.

‘That has always been one of the highlights of the year and we have a lot of friends then,’ laughs Eleanor. 

Price £1 million

Location Lewes, East Sussex

Bedrooms Four

Unique features Former library built by Sir George Gilbert Scott, octagonal atrium with balcony and fish pond, clock tower with bell 

‘And it goes on very late, so that was always a party night, but, because of its size and where it is, the house has always been a big party venue.’

A bookshelf, two tables and two librarian stools are all that’s left of the original library, and now the property is ripe for another renovation as it’s in need of updating.

‘It’s a real one-off,’ says Eleanor. ‘We’ve made it a family tradition to visit other George Gilbert Scott buildings to see what else he created, and we’ve found our tiles and some wrought iron work and certain colours he used at his more well-known buildings at our home, and that has made it very special.

‘But now it’s time for someone else to put their mark on what is one of the landmark buildings in the town.’
