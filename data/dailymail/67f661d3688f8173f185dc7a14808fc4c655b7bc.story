Sam Robson's international future is in doubt after he was overlooked for a central contract by England’s selectors despite opening the batting in all seven Tests this summer.

The 25-year-old Middlesex batsman was the most notable omission on Thursday from a group of a dozen players handed lucrative 12-month ECB deals, which also included wicketkeeper Jos Buttler ahead of Matt Prior, who is recovering from achilles tendon surgery.

Central contracts: Moeen Ali, Jimmy Anderson, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes.

Incremental contracts: Ravi Bopara, Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan, Liam Plunkett, James Tredwell.

With Kevin Pietersen sacked, Graeme Swann retired and Jonathan Trott still not considered ready for a recall after returning from last winter’s Ashes with a stress-related illness, there was the air of a new era surrounding the squad, with six players handed contracts for the first time.

All-rounder Tim Bresnan is the other player not retained, with Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes all joining Buttler in receiving their first full-time contracts.

‘The awarding of contracts enables the selectors and team management to plan for the next 12 months of international cricket,’ national selector James Whitaker said. ‘We have been hugely encouraged by the rapid development of a host of younger players in the last year, and this is reflected in six players being awarded 12-month central contracts for the first time.’

But it is Robson’s omission that will raise most eyebrows, leaving more questions over who will open alongside captain Alastair Cook during next summer’s Ashes.

Australian-born Robson was given the summer to prove he should be the man entrusted with the second opener’s position.

Nick Compton, Michael Carberry and Joe Root have also been tried alongside Cook but none has been able to make the position their own.

Hopes were high Robson could fill the role when he scored 127 in his second Test against Sri Lanka in June, and 59 in the first India Test.

His form has dipped alarmingly, though, and there is now a chance for Nottinghamshire opener Alex Hales to stake a claim for a Test place if he impresses during the World Cup this winter.

Hales is one of five players given an incremental contract along with Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Liam Plunkett and James Tredwell.
