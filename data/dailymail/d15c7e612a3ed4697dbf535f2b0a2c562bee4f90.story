One of the crazed gunmen who murdered 23 people during the Tunis museum massacre was at work moments before the attack and asked if he could go on his break. 

Yassine al-Abidi ate breakfast with his family before going to work in a Tunis travel agency. Around 10am on Wednesday he went on a break and met up with fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui before the lethal attack. 

Friends and relatives said that al-Abidi did not appear to be a religious fanatic but Tunisian authorities said that both men travelled to Libya in September for terrorist training.  

Yassine al-Abidi had breakfast with his family as normal on morning he and his fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui attacked the Bardo museum on Wednesday killing 23 people and injuring more than 60 others

Al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui pictured were both killed after a four-hour standoff with special forces 

Members of al-Abidi's family mourned him at his house, with his uncle claiming that the people his nephew killed were innocent. 'Why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam

Shortly before he and a friend gunned down 23 people at Tunisia's Bardo museum, Yassine al-Abidi sat down to a breakfast of olive oil and dates with his family and left for work at his travel agency as usual.

Relatives said last year al-Abidi began spending an increasing amount of time at a hard-line mosque near his home. 

His uncle Mohamed Abidi said: 'I am sad for Yassine, but even sadder for the victims that Yassine killed. They were innocent, why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam.

'They are the victims of terrorism. We are the victims of a demagogic network that wants only death.'

Family members said al-Abidi never complained about alcohol being served his his uncle's house or express other extremist views. 

Terry Burton and Paula Ayres survived Wednesday's terrorist attack because they were on a taxi tour

The couple were passengers on board the MSC Splendida which docked in Barcelona yesterday morning 

Sally and Brian Adey  described as ‘avid cruisers’, had been looking forward to their seven-night tour of the Mediterranean aboard MSC Splendida. Mrs Adey was murdered by the terrorists in the attack

His cousin Hanan revealed: 'He was always fun, we danced together at family weddings. He wasn't like hardline Salafists.

'On the last day he had breakfast of dates and olive oil and went to work. At 10 am he asked for a break and went and did what he did.

'He never told us not to watch television, for example.' 

His mother Zakia added: 'The son I knew could never do what was done.He could not even harm a bird.'

Meanwhile, it has emerged that a British couple narrowly avoided getting caught up in the massacre after they decided to go on a taxi tour rather than visit the world-famous museum.

The Tunisian health minister Said Aidi, visited some of the survivors recovering in hospital earlier today

Prayers were said for the victims at the Catholic cathedral of St Vincent de Paul in Tunisia earlier today

Terry Burton, 53, and Paula Ayres, 56, from King's Lynn in Norfolk were in the taxi when the driver warned them about the attack and they immediately returned to the ship.  

Mr Burton said they were in the city of Carthage when the news of the deadly attack was broadcast in Arabic over the radio. 

Translating from Arabic, their taxi driver told them what had happened before racing them back to their boat telling them: ‘it’s not safe, we need to get out of here.’

Mrs Ayres, a retired teacher, said: ‘He said “eight tourists” and then made this gesture – slitting of the throat. We had a taxi, you pay €60 and he takes you to three different places, five hours maximum.

‘He got the news off the radio. He said “we need to get back straight away”. I was very scared, I wound my window up. He insisted that we got straight back to the boat. Everywhere was closed, the roads sealed off. Overall we were very lucky to miss it all.’

Mr Burton, a carer, said: ‘You think “five minutes this way, ten minutes that way and it could have been you”.’

‘We have survived our thoughts goes out to the families of those who didn’t.’

There were emotional scenes as passengers disembarked the MSC Splendida in Barcelona

Armed police secured the port area as the cruise ship arrived to reassure the traumatised passengers 

The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among  debris

Meanwhile it has emerged that four armed police officers tasked with protecting the Bordo museum as two terrorists attacked 'were having coffees and a snack' according to one of Tunisia's senior politicians.

Abdelfattah Mourou, Vice President of the National Assembly accused four armed police officers of being absent, when in fact they should have been guarding the world-famous institution. 

Speaking today, Mr Mourou claimed 'two were having coffee' one was 'having a snack' and the final policeman 'could not be found'.

The revelations came as hundreds of tourists returned home on board cruise ships which are continuing their Mediterranean tour.  

Mr Moureau said: 'This was a huge security failure. There had been talks between the army and police about security around the Parliament building the day before the attack.'

The lax security revelations emerged as survivors of Wednesday's massacre returned home. 

There were emotional scenes in Barcelona as passengers who survived the gun attack disembarked the MSC Splendida to be greeted by family members.

Some of the passengers complained they did not receive sufficient support on the vessel after the attack

It is understood that 27 people who arrived in Tunis aboard the vessel were not on board in Barcelona 

Survivors said nobody was in the mood for dancing as the vessel made the 26-hour journey from Tunisia 

Some of the passengers are continuing their cruise through the Mediterranean despite their ordeal

British victim Sally Adey had been onboard the MSC Splendida which docked on Wednesday in Tunis. She and her husband Robert, had boarded a bus with fellow passengers to the Bardo museum. 

Last night Mr Adey was preparing to fly home to England with her body. 

Two men, Yassine al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui stood outside the museum, watching as the passengers ambled off the coaches. The pair, who had been trained in Libya, raised their Kalashnikov AK47 assault rifles and fired directly at the tourists.

The MSC Splendida arrived in Barcelona with 27 fewer passengers after its 26-hour journey from Tunis. 

Many of the passengers seemed visibly shocked as they assembled on the quayside

Passengers disembarking in Barcelona criticised the ship's crew over the 'very cold treatment' they received after their ordeal. 

Josep Lluis Cusido, 64, told the Spanish National news agency EFE: 'When we got back to the ship we were completely traumatised and while the other passengers applauded us as everyone was crying, we got virtually no attention from the crew. They were very cold.'

Mr Cusido said the ship's captain addressed the passengers inside a theatre and apologised. 

However, Mr Cusido, who is a Socialist mayor of a small Spanish village said he took the microphone to make his own protest. He said: 'It was a miracle that we were alive, that we were people with feelings and not commercial objects that came to the ship just to spend money, and that we should be looked after. We were treated much better after that.'

Passengers had been told prior to the trip to the Bardo Museum, they were told that Tunisia has been a democracy since 2011 and was quite safe.

Mr Cusido added: 'We are recovering little by little, but there are some images we won't be able to rub-out from our lives because they were terrible...I'm still thinking about the dead who fell at my side and that I could have been one of them, because they were shooting with total coldness at the people.'

Hostages flee the museum during the Tunisian special forces raid which ended in the death of both gunmen

Victoria Bronskaya, a 33-year-old tour guide from Belarus, was on a bus parked outside the National Bardo Museum in Tunis along with her mother when the attackers struck.

'We threw ourselves to the floor and they started shooting at the bus. I wasn't even afraid. You just think about saving yourself. I shouted "God save me" in Russian.'

As she and others cowered inside, the gunmen shot two other tourists trying to board the bus. The dead bodies blocked the door of the vehicle.

She added: 'That is why the terrorist could not get on board.'

Ms Bronsakaya said she and her mother were trapped on board the bus for four hours before being eventually led to safety. 

She said: 'We only started to cry afterwards, when we saw the Tunisian people taking pity on us, saying: "Forgive us".'

Newlyweds Francisco Buciegas and his wife Inma, from Cordoba, stepped off shocked after their honeymoon was cut short.

Inma, who is four-months pregnant said: ''The whole thing was really awful. It made us really anxious. 

A passenger, Josefa Ramirez, from Malaga in Spain, who was on the boat with her husband Jose Pinto, said she had dined at the same table as that couple on board the Splendida.

Mrs Ramierez said: 'Their children had paid for the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary. 

Seven hundred passengers on the Splendida ended their cruise in Barcelona, while the hundreds of others stayed on board to continue their cruise around the Mediterranean.

Piot Henri from the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion said: 'It was very sad last night. Nobody was dancing.' 

As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected.
