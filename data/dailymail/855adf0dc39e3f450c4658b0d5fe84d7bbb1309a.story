A Michigan teen was issued a $200 ticket last month for swearing near a playground in a town that has made it against the law to use foul language.

Colin Anderson, 19, of Brighton, was given the citation after saying ‘this is f*****g bulls**t’ after an officer issued a summons to one of his friends for cursing near a playground.

Brighton Police Chief Tom Wightman told the Livingston County Daily Press & Argus that the teenagers received the notices after he instructed police to crack down on disorderly conduct, whi he said includes swear words.

‘“It’s when they misbehave, it becomes an issue,’ he said. ‘We’re going to be watching.’

The group was hanging out near the Imagination Station Playground, but said that no children heard their salty language.

‘I don’t think I deserve this ticket,’ said Anderson. ‘I don’t think I did anything wrong.’

The cops disagreed, and handed him the ticket.

‘That’s what gets on our radar, their behavior,’ said Wightman, adding that city ordinances prohibit language that causes ‘a breach of the peace.’

The dirty language was used in the 
‘immediate vicinity of a municipal playground occupied by very young 
children,’ he told the paper.

Anderson claims he muttered it under his breath, but Wightman said ‘that would require an officer with some incredible hearing’ to have heard muttering.

Wightman issued a stern warning for the youth of his small city in the suburbs of Detroit.

‘Older teens and young adults who choose to ‘hang out’ near the children’s area need to know that their conduct will be carefully scrutinized.’

Neither Anderson nor Wightman returned messages left seeking further comment.
