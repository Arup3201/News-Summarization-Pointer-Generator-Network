Alan Pardew fears losing Cheick Tiote this month having been scarred by the sales of Andy Carroll and Yohan Cabaye.

The Newcastle midfielder has been the subject of a £4million bid from Lokomotiv Moscow and Sportsmail understands he wants to quit St James’ Park.

United rejected that ‘derisory’ offer and it is thought they want £14m for the former FC Twente anchorman.

Blow: Pardew says he is confident the player will stay but admits he can't be sure with big clubs lurking

Pardew is desperate to keep Tiote on Tyneside but he was also against the sales of Carroll – to Liverpool for £35m in 2011 – and Cabaye, who joined PSG for £20m in January.

And, when asked if he had a contingency plan in place should Tiote go, Pardew said: ‘Yes. I've got Andy Carroll experience here and that's one of the benefits of being here for four years.

‘But I never think that you can be safe with a player if you're not in the Champions League.

‘You've got to be on your toes at all times and I have to say I think we have been.

‘We've had (speculation) in the past. Some of it carries weight - there were a lot of rumours last season with Cabaye and PSG and it happened so I'm always open minded about it.

‘I'm as confident as I can be with any player that he will stay.’

Tiote – at 28 years old – is believed to want a big-money move and Arsenal have also been linked with the Ivory Coast international.

But Pardew added: ‘I heard there were a couple of derisory offers and I mean like way short of his valuation. Therefore we've not really entertained any serious thought of him leaving.

‘He's just a great player, a top player. Top players demand top fees if they are going to move, but at the moment that isn't the case.’

Tiote is currently sidelined with a hamstring strain and will miss tomorrow’s lunchtime trip to Aston Villa.

Jack Colback started last Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester City and was United’s best player on his debut. Pardew, though, was not surprised by his impressive start.

‘From the day he walked in here, he has looked what I hoped he was going to be, a player who can carry the Newcastle shirt,’ said the Magpies boss.

‘It's a big shirt, it carries responsibility and the role I have given him carries more responsibility than perhaps he had at Sunderland, and I think he is enjoying that.

‘I want him to express himself a little bit more, and I think he will prove that too. We are really, really pleased with him.’

Meanwhile, Italian left-back Davide Santon has been ruled out for three months with a knee injury.

‘It's not good news,’ said Pardew. ‘When the surgeon looked at his knee there was a little bit more damage than we thought.

‘That now looks like mid-November now rather than October. He had an operation in the summer and he's our long-term injury at this time.’
