Now that cars are more reliable than ever before – cyclists are going to be the new target for roadside assistance in NSW over the next couple of years as the established Victorian program is closely monitored to develop a strategy.

After experiencing a 7.3 per cent drop in roadside job requests last year due to cars breaking down  every two or three years now instead of yearly, the NRMA is planning to reach out to people using bikes to boost their membership numbers.

An NRMA spokeswoman said there was a need for diversification within the company’s services but it was a few years away before the cyclist program will be offered.

‘Our database is going to start looking at following people rather than following number plates,’ she said. 'We are not at a stage where we can speculate on premiums - we are watching other clubs and how they roll it out before we do our own strategy, so technically it’s on the cards at some point but we are just not sure of the details or when.'

The NRMA is monitoring groups such as RACV Bike Assist which operates in Victoria where a taxi can be ordered for the member and their bike if the problem can’t be fixed roadside.

The membership rates for NSW cyclists is not known at this early stage but the assistance provided for RACV members varies from $33 - $59 depending on whether you take out single or family cover.

The company has already broadened its horizons by offering an emergency home assist service with gives members eight visits per year by a tradesperson to fix common household problems such as faulty taps and blocked toilets for $190.

Also a Living Well Navigator website will be launching next month for people over 50 to use as an online resource with information including public transport, pension and job as well as a social community forum.

'The need for roadside assistance remains, but we also provide specialised battery replacement , technical support via phone, and at members' homes,' the spokeswoman said.

NRMA chief executive Tony Stuart told The Sydney Morning Herald the company needed eight to nine members out of every 10 to stay signed up each year.

‘Once upon a time they broke down once a year, now they’re breaking down every two to three years, he said.

‘But, if we we are helping them with other things, emergency home assistance, advice around mum's retirement, fixing a car as opposed to going to a dealer, people will stay with us.’
