It’s shaping up to be the most exciting Splinter Cell yet. And now, Ubisoft have released some new screens showing off Splinter Cell: Blacklist’s multiplayer.

Although most details are being kept secret, the famed Spies v Mercs mode is set to make a return.

Players will be able to face off in teams of four and create their very own Spy or Merc according to their playstyles via a host of customisable elements.

Spy hunters: Most multiplayer details are being kept under wraps, but Spies v Mercs is a wonderful addition

The original Classic Spies vs. Mercs experience also makes its long awaited comeback.

Interestingly, whereas Splinter Cell Conviction’s co-operative felt slightly disjointed from the main narrative, Blacklist's new Strategic Mission Interface allows a much more connected experience.

The SMI allows 4th Echelon to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can take advantage of the universal game economy system to customise and upgrade Sam, his suit, goggles and weapons in single player.

While In multiplayer, Sam and Briggs can earn in-game currency and unlock additional weapons or gadgets via specialized missions assigned by Grim, Briggs, Charlie and Kobin.

Visually, the game is reportedly using the same LEAD engine that powered Conviction - essentially a modified version of Unreal 2.5. There's no word yet on whether LEAD is cross generational, although Blacklist has not been slated as a next-gen release.

The game's length, too, has not been discussed - with criticisms of Conviction centering around the its short playtime.

It takes two to tango: Co-operative has been tweaked and improved to make use of the new SMI mechanic

There are also reports that the game's dynamic 'torture' mechanic - used sparingly in Conviction - has been overhauled and features more prominently.

It’s set for release on August 20.
