Following the success of Sister Wives, TLC has announced that it will produce a new one-hour special about an even larger polygamous family who left the Mormon church due to its conservative beliefs.

My Five Wives will follow Brady Williams, his five wives and their combined 24 children who live together on their large family property outside Salt Lake City, Utah.

The show will go behind closed doors and focus on the frustrations, needs and fears of a family living the controversial lifestyle, according to a TLC press release.

The Williams family emphasizes that their focus is on love and commitment rather than religion, and they believe in a God who loves and accepts everyone.

Though their beliefs have estranged from many family members, the members of the Williams family believe that their sacrifices are worth it.

Patriarch Brady Williams,a construction site manager, was born into the Mormon Church. But he did not hear about polygamy until age 16, when his parents converted to a faith that embraced the lifestyle.

First wife Paulie, a dental hygienist, has been married to Brady for 21 years, and the couple's six children range in age from 20 to nine years old.

She was raised in a polygamist family and expected Brady to have additional wives, but her oldest daughter is recently married and plans a monogamist lifestyle.

Brady married second wife Robyn - dubbed 'the creative wife' for her art classes and love of making gifts for the family - about nine months after his ceremony to Paulie, and they have five children.

Third wife Rosemary worked in the family construction business but stopped after winning a scholarship at the local college, where she is studying for her teaching degree in music. She has four children with Brady.

Nonie, Brady's fourth wife, was living in Montana when she met him 15 year ago, and the duo had a long-distance relationship. She is the only wife that works with Brady, handling the administrative side of the family's construction business, while being a mom to their five children.

Fifth wife Rhonda is Robyn's cousin. She entered the picture 12 years ago, admits that it took eight years before she really felt that she belonged in the family.

Though she says that there are downsides to polygamy, she loves that her four children have other mothers around. Cameras will reportedly be allowed into the bedroom, and the women will speak openly about their frustrations with Brady's schedule.

The show premieres on September 15, right after Sister Wives - the reality show that first brought polygamy into many Americans' living rooms.
