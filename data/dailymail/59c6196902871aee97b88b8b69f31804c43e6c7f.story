David Cameron has spoken for the first time about an alleged plot by Islamic extremists to take over schools in Birmingham, promising ‘swift action’ to ensure they are not being used to spread the ideology of terrorists.

The Department for Education is believed to be investigating 12 schools in the city after claims that non-Muslim members of staff were being isolated, male and female pupils segregated and assemblies used to promote the teachings of Al Qaeda.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said: ‘We will not accept any school being run by extremists or promoting extremist views.

Response: Mr Cameron said Ofsted have 'all the powers they need to intervene' if extremists ran schools

‘It’s not acceptable, we can’t have that happening in our country and Ofsted have all the powers they need to intervene. They are able to get in there and inspect to see where things have gone wrong.’

Allegations of the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to allow hardline Muslims to take over a handful of schools were revealed last month in a leaked letter – supposedly written from one extremist to another.

It detailed a five-step plan designed to take over the running of several Birmingham state schools, and listed examples of the non-Muslim staff members who they had successfully ‘forced out’.

Claims: It is alleged the views of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were promoted

The authenticity of the document has since been called into question.

But following its emergence, Birmingham City Council has apparently been ‘inundated’ with claims from headteachers, parents and governors claiming that they have seen the tactics at work in their schools.

Yesterday Labour MP Liam Byrne criticised the probe for progressing at a ‘glacial’ speed.

And Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood claimed that the council has known about these allegations for ‘eight years at least’ but failed to act for fear of ‘appearing anti-Muslim’.

The Labour politician said: ‘Young people are being targeted from a young age in schools across Birmingham. It’s much like what we got in the 1980s and 1990s where radicalism was being taught in universities where there were greater numbers of young people they could attract.

‘They are using schools in this way to persuade children to see their way of thinking, which will be useful to them later on.’

Mr Mahmood was responding to the two members of staff at Park View Academy who yesterday claimed a senior colleague had endorsed the teachings of the now dead American-born senior Al Qaeda militant Anwar al-Awlaki.

The teachers also said a viewpoint politically sympathetic to the terrorist group had been promoted in an assembly.

Park View Academy, in Birmingham’s Alum Rock, denies the allegations – which were broadcast anonymously on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Tahir Alam, who has been a governor at Park View for 17 years, said: ‘It is a witch hunt based on false allegations.’

However, the majority of governors at the school are said to be followers of the Wahhabi movement – an ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam.

And another teacher, who has worked at several Birmingham schools, including Park View, told the Mail: ‘They are promoting a radical form of Islam.

‘Children know no better so they just accept it, then they go home and their parents aren’t aware of it so these views go unchallenged. I’m worried about what the future will hold for these children.’

Yesterday Graham Stuart, the chairman of the Commons education select committee, called the allegations ‘disturbing’, adding: ‘Having children indoctrinated by extremists in a state-funded school would clearly be utterly unacceptable and a scandal and needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.’
