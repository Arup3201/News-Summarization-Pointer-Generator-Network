A 25-year-old 'internet sensation' has been imprisoned for five years on child porn charges for persuading 11 underage female fans to send sexually explicit pictures and videos of themselves to him.

Michael Lombardo - better known by his YouTube channel name, Mike Lombardo, on which he sings love song ballads on the piano - pleaded guilty in September to the charges, which involved girls aged between 15 and 17.

'Lombardo took advantage of his position as an Internet star, and took advantage of his following of female teenage fans on YouTube,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Tamara Thomson wrote in a sentencing memorandum, according to The Post-Standard.

The five-year prison sentence was the minimum U.S. District Judge David Hurd could have imposed, with a maximum of 20 years.

Lombardo is also forced to register as a convicted sex offender.

Lombardo graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston.

He developed a following over YouTube and started communicating with those fans over the Internet and by texting, court papers said.

Lombardo was arrested in July 2012 at his home following a seven-month FBI investigation that began after he'd arranged a liaison with a 15-year-old fan from Indiana, according to court documents.

In a pre-sentence report, Lombardo told probation officers that while he knows his victims were adversely affected, some of them were thrilled to send him the photos, Thomson wrote in her memorandum.

His rationale for his conduct was that he was friendless, so he depended on online relationships, Thomson wrote.

Lombardo suffers from 'significant mental and emotional problems', his lawyer, Donald Kinsella, wrote in court papers.

After Lombardo's music became popular on YouTube, he was sought-after for live concerts and internet performances, Kinsella wrote.

Lombardo developed a following of fans, 'some of whom became ''groupies'',' Kinsella wrote.

But Lombardo was only between 21 and 23-years-old when he committed his crimes, the lawyer wrote.

'In addition, he never posted, disseminated, or shared any of the images or videos that were made during the course of his conduct,' Kinsella wrote. 

In a September 2010 online conversation with a 16-year-old girl, prosecutors noted that Lombardo was keenly aware that he was violating the law.

During that exchange, Lombardo suggested to the girl that she delete chat logs and photos they exchanged since, 'that’s like 5 years in federal prison and sex offender registration'.

He added, 'until you’re 18. Lol'.

But Lombardo never had sexual contact with an underage victim, Kinsella said.

About 80 percent of the female fans Lombardo had cybersex with were older than 17, Kinsella wrote.

Prosecutors argued that Lombardo should receive 20 years in prison, the statutory maximum. But his lawyers countered that the mandatory minimum, five years, was appropriate punishment

The Indiana victim traveled with two 17-year-old female friends to Ellicottville, N.Y., to meet Lombardo in December 2011, court papers said.

FBI agents, who'd been tipped off about the liaison, interviewed the girls there and all three revealed that Lombardo had enticed them to send sexually explicit videos and pictures, court papers said.

The victims said they'd also received sexually explicit images from Lombardo, the papers said.

Lombardo estimated that he engaged in cybersex with 'about fifty females and that probably 80% of them were adult', according to The Smoking Gun.

As a condition of his plea, Lombardo agreed to forfeit three laptop computers and his smartphone.

Lombardo will have to surrender to the Bureau of Prisons by 2 PM on April 15, according to court records.
