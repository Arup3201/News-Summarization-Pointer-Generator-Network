Jailed: Allison Hawksworth, 61, of Old Basing, Hampshire, ran a fake children's clothing company

A grandmother who lied about having cancer in a bid to avoid questioning from tax investigators swindled taxpayers out of £286,000 before blowing it on shopping sprees and holidays.

Allison Hawksworth, of Old Basing, Hampshire, who ran a fake children’s clothing company and claimed back a fortune in VAT to which she was not entitled, was today jailed for a year.

The 61-year-old, who has three daughters and three grandchildren, lived off benefits and spent her gains on trips to the U.S., TV shopping, a new kitchen and presents for friends and family.

And Hawksworth - who carried out her con for ten years - lied about having cancer, a heart attack, and a fractured skull in a bid to avoid questioning when tax investigators came calling.

The bogus businesswoman set up the company Kids at Heart to make luxury christening gowns for children in 2002 - but soon found VAT fraud more profitable, Winchester Crown Court heard.

She abused the fact that no VAT is paid on children’s clothes to illegitimately claim back thousands of pounds from HM Revenue and Customs.

The scam netted her the huge amount without ever having to leave her bungalow. She frittered some of the money away on a holiday to Florida to meet an online friend and a trip to Atlanta, Georgia.

Prosecutor Dawn Hyland said Hawksworth’s quarterly claims for VAT on materials she had allegedly bought from suppliers began modestly in 2002.

But by 2004 the amounts rose to £6,000 and £7,500, peaking at £11,980 in November 2011. In total, she claimed £286,649 - but no business was running, Miss Hyland said.

Tax officials became suspicious, but Hawksworth lied about having ovarian cancer, liver cancer and a fractured skull to avoid inspectors.

She told an investigator his phone call had ‘been the cause of her requiring hospital treatment for a heart attack’.

And she even pretended to be her own daughter, Julia, telling inspectors her ‘mother’ had had a major stroke and was in a nursing home last June.

After her eventual arrest in October, she told police she had no memory of ever making the claims or being pursued by investigators over the decade.

Hawksworth pleaded guilty to defraud HMRC on the basis she originally set up Kids at Heart as a genuine business, which prosecutors accepted.

She was handed 12 months in prison - but will serve half before being released on parole.

'You told the probation officer that you were operating in a haze, that you did not know what you were doing. That I cannot accept'

Sentencing her, Judge Jane Miller said: ‘You are a 61-year-old lady of previously good character.

'Sadly, there is no money which can be claimed back. You told the probation officer that you were operating in a haze, that you did not know what you were doing. That I cannot accept.’

Lucia Whittle-Martin, defending, said her client was a ‘sad individual’ with ‘deep-seated issues’ who had tried to ‘buy friendship and love’.

Speaking after the case, Andrew Sackey of HMRC said: ‘Allison Hawksworth submitted fraudulent VAT repayment claims to cheat honest taxpayers out of nearly £300,000 over 10 years.

‘HMRC is determined to crack down on this type of fraud.’
