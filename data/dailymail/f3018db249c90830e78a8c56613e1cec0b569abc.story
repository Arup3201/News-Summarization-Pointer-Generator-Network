It is a deadly virus that has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,400 people.

So, when the Jacksonville Jaguars' mascot made a joke about Ebola, he sparked a storm of criticism.

The mascot, who has played the role of Jaxson de Ville for 20 seasons, commented on the disease, which recently infected an NBC cameraman, during the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Florida yesterday.

Referring to Steelers' fans' iconic 'Terrible Towels', he held up a handwritten sign reading: 'Towels carry Ebola', while carrying one of the yellow towels in his right hand.

The large sign immediately prompted outrage among sports fans and social media users alike, with many deeming it 'inappropriate' and 'ignorant'.

Twitter user Ronnie K, who watched the game live, wrote: 'Whoever came up with the Ebola Towel joke in #Jacksonville should be fired. On the spot.'

Meanwhile, Marc Bowers said: 'Hey #Jaguars. Just maybe this week you can teach your mascot some class. His Ebola sign and holding Terrible Tower today was ignorant.'

Another user added: 'That's fowl (sic). You can't joke about an epidemic.'

Behind the joke? Curtis Dvorak (pictured, right, at Southside Business Men's Club) has acted as the Jaguars' mascot for nearly 20 seasons. He is believed to have been wearing the yellow-and-blue outfit at the time

Today, the Jaguars apologized for the sign, which was created and held up by Jaxon de Ville during the fourth quarter of the game at Everbank Field, which the team lost 17-9. 

According to ESPN, Curtis Dvorak, who has worn the yellow-and-blue suit for nearly 20 seasons, is believed to have been wearing it at the time.

'Improvisation and humor have both been key elements to the character of Jaxson de Ville, especially when he performs at home games,' the Jaguars' president Mark Lamping said.

'On Sunday, the person who has played Jaxson de Ville over the past 20 seasons made an extremely poor decision in that regard.

Outraged: Twitter user Just D also criticized the sign, writing: 'Wow, just heard about the Terrible Towel/Ebola sign the Jags mascot was holding up yesterday. That's fowl (sic). You can't joke about an epidemic'

Angry: User Chris Otto hit out against the mascot's behavior, deeming it both 'ridiculous' and 'inappropriate'

'The team was unaware of this inappropriate sign until after it had been displayed. We extend our sincerest apologies to anyone who was offended.'

He added that the Jaguars were handling the matter 'internally and seriously'.

As a highly infectious viral disease, Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids and has a mortality rate of nearly 90 per cent.

Virus: Last week, Liberian national Thomas Duncan, who arrived in Texas on September 20, became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil. Above, cleaning crews are seen at his apartment

The most recent outbreak of the virus, which is the deadliest on record, began with just a few handful of cases in Guinea, West Africa in March. 

Last week, Liberian national Thomas Duncan, who arrived in Texas on September 20, became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil. 

Today, American photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo, also infected with Ebola, arrived at a specialized bio-containment unit in Nebraska to begin life-saving treatment.

Mr Mukpo, from Providence, Rhode Island, had been in Liberia covering the Ebola crisis and was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC when he fell ill last Wednesday.

Dressed in a full bodysuit and a face mask, he arrived at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday morning in an ambulance surrounded by a police convoy.

He is the fifth American flown home to be treated for the disease and the second patient taken to Nebraska Medical Center's bio-containment unit.
