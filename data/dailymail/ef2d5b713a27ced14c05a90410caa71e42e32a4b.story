George McLachrie, 19, was given a restraining order after he continued to harass his girlfriend after split

An IT student was handed a restraining order after he harassed his ex-girlfriend by taking pictures of her house at night and creeping up behind her shouting ‘BOO’.

George McLachrie continued to contact Malissa Buasri after the pair split up in February this year, even though he was told he was not wanted.

The 19-year-old from Pinvin, Worcestershire, was given a harassment notice by police in March and a further warning in April.

But the day after his second warning he crept up behind his former girlfriend at a train station and said ‘boo’ – which left her to be startled and upset.

He also took a picture of the back of her house in Ledbury, Herefordshire, at night and posted it on the app Snapchat with the caption ‘I can’t see you’.

The teenager admitted harassment without violence when he appeared at Worcester Magistrates Court on Friday.

District judge Nigel Cadbury said McLachrie had continued with his pattern of behaviour for ‘just a bit too long’.

Prosecutor Adrian Jones told the court the teenager harassed Miss Buarsi between April 28 and May 1 by ‘startling’ her and taking a picture of her home.

He said the pair had been in a short relationship which started in November last year and ended in February.

Mr Jones added: ‘On April 30 the defendant walked up behind the complainant at Foregate Street train station and said ‘boo’ causing her to be startled and upset.’

Speaking about the incident when he posted a picture of her house on Snapchat, he added: ‘This caused the complainant to be fearful for her safety.’

The court heard McLachrie told police he understood his behaviour was harassment and said he did it to ‘wind up the complainant’s friend’.

Defending the IT student, Amer Hussain said McLachrie and Miss Buasri both attended the Heart of Worcestershire College.

He added: ‘There have been no further complaints of any further behaviour. He has not engaged with her and hasn’t sent her any text messages.

‘He is beginning to make the adjustment that the relationship has come to its natural conclusion.

‘He describes it as being his first significant relationship, his first significant girlfriend.

‘He has altered his behaviour.’

He escaped a prison sentence but was given a conditional discharge of two years and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

He was also handed a two-year restraining order which states that he must not contact Miss Buasari directly or go within half-a-mile of her home.
