The first of 20 planned Virgin Hotels opened in Chicago on Thursday, January 15, in a 26-storey, art-deco building just minutes from the city's famed Magic Mile.

And with no-formal check in desk and rooms powered almost exclusively from the hotel's app, the property is as innovative as you would expect.

'It's been a long held dream to start beautiful, comfortable, fun hotels for guests and give them what they want and need while being gentle on their wallets,' Virgin Group Founder, Richard Branson, said.

'I'm tremendously proud of the brilliant Virgin Hotels team, and I look forward to hosting our fans and spending more time in Chicago.'

The hospitality group, which includes everything from airplanes to mobile phone plans, have long made eliminating fees and surcharges a top priority.

So it's perhaps no surprise that WiFi is free, check-in fees have been eliminated and even room service is available at no additional cost.

The 26-storey art-deco hotel boasts 250 guest rooms and 4 restaurants - and starts at £140 per night

Virgin Hotels Chicago is located in the historic Old Dear Born Bank Building, a Chicago landmark, and offers 250 guest rooms, which start at just £140.

There are 40 one-bedroom suites and two luxurious Penthouses.

Several of the buildings original features remain in tact, such as 1920s oak Cigar Bar that serves as the hotel's front desk, as well as brass elevator doors.

At the heart of the property is The Commons Club, a members-only inspired space where guests can drink, dine and mingle.

It's here that visitors can also take advantage of Social Hour - like happy hour, but better - where all drinks are free between 6pm and 7pm. 

The hotel will also have four additional dining options including Miss Ricky's, an all-American diner with rooftop bar and lounge.

All rooms will follow a two-chamber room layout, chock full of small touches that make travelling that much more convenient.

The dressing room includes a full vanity, make-up desk and mirror and an extra-large shower with a bench. His and hers closets are also featured.

In the bedroom, ample outlets are available - and you'll need them.

The entire room - including temperature control, room service orders and television programmes - is customisable through the hotel app, called Lucy, via your phone or iPad.

Your phone is also a key component in your check-in process - you check in online using the app, scan the QR code at a lobby kiosk and retrieve your key from a machine.

Branson is also taking the hotel beds to another level with a patent-pending, ergonomically designed bed with a leather headboard and backrest in one corner.

All rooms are two-room 'chambers,' with a separate dressing room and bedroom area

Not headed to the Windy City anytime soon?

Virgin Hotels has plans to open a second location in Nashville in summer 2016 and a third property in New York City in the fall of 2017, with 20 locations by 2025.

'Chicago is an exhilarating and historic city, and a place we're happy to call home for the first-ever Virgin Hotel,' said Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels.

Virgin Hotels has also unveiled plans for a New York City base which will open on the northwest corner of 29th Street and Broadway in 2016

'It's an exciting time for our team as we get to unveil our new approach to room design, service, and entertainment within the hotel industry.

'We hope our fans recognise the subtle, yet authentic Chicago touches throughout the hotel and come to think of us as their place away from home whether they're travelling or a local.'
