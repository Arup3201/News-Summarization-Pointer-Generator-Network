Looking for a piece of history with prime water views across Sydney Harbour?

One of Birchgrove's largest heritage estates is up for the taking ... for the right price.

Built in the 1860s, 'Ravenscourt' on Wharf Rd, is is one of Sydney's original waterfront homes. With its ornate gardens, 18m water frontage and spectacular views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the property  is expected to fetch about $11.5 million.

Enjoying 1,100 sq metres of absolute harbourfront, the three-storey home also boasts grand dining rooms, a Butler's pantry, stained glass windows, marble fireplaces, its own tidal pool and verandahs with the best views in town.

'Ravenscourt' has only had three owners in its history and,  like many homes in the area, has been kept within the one family.

Property Agent Mathew Hayson says it's rare for this kind of estate to come on the market.

'You can probably count on one hand the number of properties that have come up in the last two decades', he told Daily Mail Australia. 'There are only about 200 waterfront homes and most of them have been owned for a very long time.'

He says the Stannard family for example, who ran the first boat-building company  in the area in 1900s, owned all the dockyards for 'a good 100 years.'

Hayson expects 'Ravenscourt' to sell in the same price range as two similar waterfront Wharf Rd properties: Number 43 Wharf Rd went for $11.5m in 2008 and number 19 for $11.1m in 2009.

Originally built for a Sydney barrister, Lucius O'Brien, the Ravenscourt estate was remodeled into the Italianate style in 1888 by Eduard Buchanon, then major of Balmain.

The heritage-listed property now sits in one of the best-preserved neighbourhoods of nineteenth and early twentieth century architecture in Sydney. 

Wharf Rd is lined with grand Victorian and Federation homes, but for a long time, the area was a rural, working class neighbourhood. In 1912, a boat building company was established at Number 19 which soon became a large maritime engineering works, operating ferries and servicing naval craft during the second World War. Today, Wharf Rd is home to one of the few surviving boat building and repair works on Sydney Harbour.
