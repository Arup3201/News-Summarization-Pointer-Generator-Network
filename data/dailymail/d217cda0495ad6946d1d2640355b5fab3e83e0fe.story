Union whistleblower Kathy Jackson said her affair with union barrister Mark Irving was a mistake and and described having a one-night fling with him as nothing more than 'a charity shag' which would take place in a lounge-room with a barber's chair.

Ms Jackson's comments outside the royal commission into union corruption follow her unsuccessful bid to prevent Mr Irving from cross examining her, claiming yesterday in an affidavit that he would be biased. But her claim was ultimately rejected by the commission. 

Speaking outside the commission today, she pulled no punches today, dismissing their brief affair of 21 years ago.

'Forget the former lover stuff - everybody makes mistakes and has a charity shag along the way,' she said.

'Forget the lover stuff - everybody makes mistakes and has a charity shag along the way' is how Health Services Union boss Kathy Jackson described her affair with barrister Mark Irving

Barrister Mark Irving, representing the Health Services Union, leaves the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption in Sydney. His former lover Kathy Jackson had unsuccessfully attempted to stop him being able to cross-examine her during proceedings

Her affidavit read: 'Over the course of the next six to eight weeks I would go back to his place after Friday night drinks and we would have sex. I recall he lived near the cemetery and had a barber’s chair in his lounge'.

Ms Jackson went further today, describing the investigation into her alleged misuse of union members' funds as being the equivalent of 'judicial gang rape'. She also insisted that she wouldn't try to expose union corruption again.

Ms Jackson finished giving evidence to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption and used a media conference to make the comparison about the proceedings against her.

Ms Jackson said she 'could not believe the audacity' of one-time lover Mark Irving, now the barrister for the Health Services Union, cross-examining her before the commission about her alleged improper use of union funds.

Ms Jackson said she now understands the community concern about union slush funds like the one she operated as national secretary of the Health Services Union.

The commission has investigated Ms Jackson's use of a $280,000 union slush fund known as the National Health Development Association - including a $50,000 withdrawal that was paid to her ex-husband.

Ms Jackson called for all unions and union officials to be investigated like she had been.

Kathy Jackson says the funds were needed because there are 'vultures' in the ALP circling unions to take them over

Ms Jackson had attempted to stop union barrister Mark Irving (above) from questioning her because she argued in an affidavit that he would be hostile to her due to their six-week affair. Her request was thrown out

'They should be looked into because I understand now the community concern,' she said.

'But the reason they're there and the reason they were set up not just in my time but before my time is to get around electoral disclosure.'

Asked if she was playing along with the game, Ms Jackson said 'of course I was'.

'But it was more than that - I was buying protection for my members,' she said.

Ms Jackson said funds were needed to protect the union from 'vultures' in the ALP 'that are circling these unions to take them over'.

Yesterday she recalled in the affidavit that: 'after about eight months, in or about, late 1992 or early 1993 Mr Irving and I had a few too many drinks and went back to his place where we had a sexual relationship'.

'I was at the time married to my first husband, which he knew.'

Ms Jackson has been excused from the commission.

The commission will continue next week with investigation of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.
