Nicholas Stewart, from Blackpool, was branded a danger to public health after he was caught selling bottles of fake spirits filled with urine

A conman was branded a danger to public health after he was caught selling bottles filled with urine as whisky to tourists.

Nicholas Stewart was arrested after he was seen trying to sell the one and a half litre bottles of fake whisky and vodka to holidaymakers for £10, a court heard.

Scientific analysis revealed some drinks merely contained flat cola but in others they found evidence of human waste.

Blackpool Council prosecutor Victoria Cartmell said the drinks had probably been laced with faeces and urine to give the colour of whisky.

The 35-year-old, from Blackpool, was spared jail for the sickening offence and was handed a 70 day jail term suspended for 12 months after he admitted fraud.

Prosecutors are now working with police to impose a CRASBO to ban him from selling anything on the streets of Blackpool.

It was the second time is seven days that courts heard how Stewart had duped holidaymakers into parting with the £10 for what they thought were sealed one and a half litre bottles of spirits.

The bottles were seized by security staff when Stewart was seen approaching customers in the massive Coral Island slot machine complex.

Blackpool Council prosecutor Victoria Cartmell revealed the most sinister threat to public health posed by Stewart.

'Two of the bottles seized from him were sent for analysis,' she said. 'They were purported to contain whisky and vodka.'

'But they were water laced with urine and faeces probably to give the so called whisky colour.'

'They were totally unsuitable for public consumption- they were hazardous and contained dangerous e-coli bacteria.'

'This man  has been involved in 32 incidents and is a persistent and troublesome offender.'

CRASBOs are Anti-Social Behaviours Orders that are made on the back of criminal conviction.

The individual subject of the CRASBO will have a set of prohibitions unique to the case to prevent anti-social behaviour re-occurring and protect the Community from such acts. 

They can be used to ban someone from entering a defined area and certain buildings or shopping centres. CRASBOs can also ban an individual associating with certain people and can impose a curfew.

The maximum penalty for breaching the order is five years imprisonment.

'We are working with the police and will apply to the courts for a CRASBO against Mr Stewart forbidding him from selling anything in Blackpool.' 

Martin Hillson, defending, said he would be objecting to the CRASBO because it would even ban his client from selling The Big Issue magazine. 

He said: 'It is a blanket ban in a set geographical area.'

At an earlier hearing Mr Hillson said that Stewart carried out the alcohol scam because he needed money for food.

Sentencing Stewart to the 70 days magistrates told him: 'You are a danger to public health.'

The court heard how Stewart used Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniels bottles which he managed to re seal to dupe the public into thinking they were buying the real thing.
