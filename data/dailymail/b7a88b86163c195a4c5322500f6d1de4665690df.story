A judge ordered 23-year-old Saudi Arabia air force sergeant Thursday to stand trial for the sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy on New Year's Eve in a Las Vegas Strip hotel room.

A defense attorney for Mazen Alotaibi and a Saudi consulate legal attache huddled with prosecutors for two hours before Alotaibi waived his right to a preliminary hearing of evidence against him.

The move meant the alleged victim and a police detective who prosecutors said were ready to testify didn't have to take the stand.

Defense attorney Don Chairez conceded
the testimony probably would have met what he termed the minimal 
standard to show a felony had been committed, allowing the judge to move
the case to state court.

‘A preliminary hearing is basically a rubber stamp process,’ Chairez said.

Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Bill 
Kephart asked Alotaibi if he understood what was happening. Standing 
with an Arabic translator, Alotaibi responded ‘yes’ in English.

Chairez and Saudi Arabia consulate 
legal affairs official Abdulqader Mohammed Al Hazza said outside the 
courtroom that evidence was still being collected. Negotiations were 
under way to resolve the case, Chairez said.

‘Both governments are looking for the
truth,’ Al Hazza told The Associated Press. ‘We just need time to bring
the evidence together to show the truth.’

Chairez said he hopes tests on blood 
samples drawn after Alotaibi's arrest will show the aircraft mechanic 
was too drunk at the time to give up his constitutional right to have a 
lawyer present during questioning.

Chairez said police didn't provide 
Alotaibi with a translator during questioning, even though Alotaibi told
detectives several times during his 70-minute interview that he didn't 
understand what was happening.

Meanwhile, prosecutors Mary Kay 
Holthus and James Sweetin added two new child lewdness charges to the 
seven charges already pending against Alotaibi.

Those counts include kidnapping, sexual assault with a minor, coercion, lewdness with a minor and burglary.

Alotaibi could face life in prison if he's convicted of the kidnapping and sex assault charges.

Kephart increased bail from 
$1.22million to $1.72million based on the new charges, which allege that
Alotaibi kissed the boy during a sex act.

Chairez said Alotaibi will plead not guilty to all charges at his arraignment set for February 6 in Clark County District Court.

Alotaibi is accused of forcing the 
boy into a hotel room where as many as four other Saudi officers smoked 
cigarettes or marijuana on the morning before a New Year's Eve fireworks
celebration on the Las Vegas Strip.

Police said Alotaibi acknowledged 
during questioning that he had sex with the boy, and investigators 
collected DNA evidence, a used condom and soiled towel from the bathroom
where the boy said the attack took place.

Chairez said the boy splits time 
living with divorced parents in California and had been staying at the 
Circus-Circus hotel with his father. He told police he was accosted 
while on his way to a hotel doughnut shop about 7.30am.

Chairez has said the boy wanted marijuana and refused repeated attempts by the Saudi men to get him to leave their hotel room.

The defense lawyer said that if sex took place, it was consensual.

Prosecutors say that even if the boy wanted to have sex, Nevada state law says a child under age 16 cannot give consent.

Alotaibi told police he was drinking 
Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied 
allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to 
have sex with him for money.

The
report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators 
that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of 
seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him.

McGrath
said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said
he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, 
Texas.

U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said.

Joint
Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated 
Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air
Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at 
Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a 
Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to 
improve their English-language skills.

The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower. Circus Circus has a total of 3,767 guest rooms in three towers and five three-story motor lodge-style buildings dubbed Circus Circus Manor.

Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic law, and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment.

Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liquor could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.
