The French president today called for the lifting of the West's economic sanctions on Russia, saying: 'Mr Putin does not want to annex eastern Ukraine. He has told me that.'

Saying the sanctions 'must stop now', Francois Hollande said he was expecting progress on a resolution to the Ukraine crisis at international talks in Kazakhstan in 10 days.

The crisis in Ukraine has prevented cash-strapped France from completing the delivery of two Mistral-class warships to Russia, a deal left in limbo since accusations Russia has interfered in Ukraine's civil war.

France, already struggling economically, could be liable for hefty fines if it breaches the 1.2-billion-euro contract.

'I think the sanctions must stop now,' President Hollande said during a wide-ranging two-hour interview with France Inter radio station. 'They must be lifted if there is progress. If there is no progress the sanctions will remain.'

Ukraine's Western-backed leader Petro Poroshenko is to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin at a meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana in ten days, which will also be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Mr Hollande said: 'I am going to Astana on January 15 on one condition, that there be fresh progress. And I think there will be. If it is to meet and talk without making headway, it is not worth it.'

The French president said that while Europe should keep lines of communication open with President Putin, 'he must know where to stop, and it has been costly for him.'

Sanctions imposed by the European Union and the U.S., along with plunging oil prices, have sent the rouble crashing by some 40 per cent against the dollar.

The punitive measures were slapped on Ukraine's former Soviet stablemate after Moscow annexed Crimea, and was subsequently accused of stoking separatist conflict in the east of the country.

Moscow denies it has backed the conflict which has left over 4,700 dead, as well as a charge it has supplied weapons and troops to rebels.

Pointing out that Mr Putin had told him he had no intention of annexing east Ukraine, Mr Hollande said: 'What he wants is to remain influential. What he wants is for Ukraine not to fall into the NATO camp.

'What we want is that he respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine. What we want is that he does not support the separatists.'

Paris in November pushed back the delivery of the high-tech Mistral class 'vessels' bought by Russia 'until further notice'.

Just before Christmas celebrations, the some 400 sailors training to operate the ships left for Russia.
