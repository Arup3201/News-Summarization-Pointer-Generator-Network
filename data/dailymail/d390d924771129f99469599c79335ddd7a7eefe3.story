A visitor to Seattle in the US snapped the exact moment a couple got engaged on Valentine's Day just seconds before he rushed off to board his bus home.

And after posting the tender moment on Reddit in a bid to get in touch with the happy couple, it appears the two parties might be brought together.

Redditor serg82 was visiting Seattle as part of a tour group on Valentine's Day, and made a stop-off in Kerry Park in the afternoon.
