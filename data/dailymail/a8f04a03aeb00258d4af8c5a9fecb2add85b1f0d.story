Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has suggested one of his drivers will require psychological counselling should they lose this year's Formula One world title by the controversial double-points system.

For the final race of the campaign, which this year will be in Abu Dhabi in November, the top 10 drivers will collect twice the normal amount of points for a race, with the winner enjoying 50.

When announced in December, fans worldwide vehemently criticised F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone's plan, believing it to be too artificial and a disservice to the sport.

Unfair: Toto Wolff has condemned the controversial double-points system

Wolff has never been a fan either, and with it now becoming patently obvious either Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg will win the crown, he has openly joined the chorus of condemnation.

Following a German Grand Prix won by Rosberg, with Hamilton a superb third after starting from 20th on the grid to limit the damage to his team-mate, the gap between the two is now 14 points.

With it likely to remain nip and tuck between them over the second half of the season, Wolff said: 'I would be very surprised if it didn't come down to Abu Dhabi, to the very famous double points.

'It means even if you're 30 points behind then you can turn it around in Abu Dhabi if the leading guy retires.

'So maybe Bernie was right, that double points is going to keep the championship open until the last race.

'But I don't think it's fair. I don't think we should have done it.

'The reason we did was because the commercial rights holder is head of sponsorship and he cares about the TV audience and the need to keep the excitement until the end, the last race.

'As I said, it looks like he might be right, that the last race is going to be the decisive one, and I would be very surprised if the audiences weren't considerably higher than they would normally be.'

Should a driver lose by such a system, Wolff believes it would be hard for that man to bear.

'Neither of them will care if they won it that way,' added Wolff.

'But the one who loses on double points will need some psychological treatment - although we're not there yet.'

From Hamilton's perspective, to claim via double points what would be his second world title is irrelevant in his eyes.

'I want to win it,' said Hamilton.

'I'm not going to get to the end of the season, and if I won it that way, say I didn't want to win it that way. I just want to win the world championship.

'It's not just that one race that will decide it, but all the races before and how I performed before that will characterise the way I feel about it.'
