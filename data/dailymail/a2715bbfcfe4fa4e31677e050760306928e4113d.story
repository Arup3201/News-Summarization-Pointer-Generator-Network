Tony Blair’s charities have received millions of pounds from some of his closest friends, it emerged today.

The former prime minister set up several foundations and initiatives after leaving Number 10 in 2007.

Now details have emerged of the wealthy businessmen and women who helped launch them and keep them afloat, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban.

Since quitting Downing Street seven years ago, Mr Blair has secured donations from the world’s super-rich to bankroll several good causes, including the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.

Italian businessman Paolo Pellegrini and his wife Henrietta gave £1million to the Africa Governance Initiative, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The money was used to establish smart offices overlooking Hyde Park.

Bill Gates, the Microsoft mogul who is worth more than £50billion, and his wife Melinda gave £500,000 to Africa Governance Initiative last year.

The couple are known to be good friends with Mr Blair and his wife Cherie.

The funding was revealed in documents filed by the charities on both sides of the Atlantic.

Mr Blair’s business dealings since leaving office have often come under scrutiny.

Last week he appeared to not rule out working for President Putin as he defended making millions from advising some of the world’s worst despots.

Mr Blair used an interview with Vanity Fair to defend the considerable wealth he has accrued since leaving office while insisting his main aim was to improve the world.

The 61-year-old has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders, including the ex-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Kazakhstan president Nursulstan Nazarbayev.

After detailing Mr Blair’s work for several questionable world leaders, the author of the profile and interview, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison, wrote: ‘And is there anyone he wouldn’t work for?

‘For instance, would he work for Vladimir Putin if Putin called asking for advice? Blair smiled, and switched the topic to Kazakhstan.’

Later she wrote: ‘He paused and then added, “I’m not holding my breath for the call from Putin.” 

‘But if it came, I asked? “It won’t come, so let me not either praise or insult”.’

He insisted the Russian leader was never likely to seek his services.

Mr Blair, who insisted that ‘whatever criticisms people have of me, they’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid’, said there were no conflicts of interest between his charity role and lucrative work as an international advisor.

But he stressed that he was now a ‘private sector individual’ not a government representative and should not be bound by the same rules.
