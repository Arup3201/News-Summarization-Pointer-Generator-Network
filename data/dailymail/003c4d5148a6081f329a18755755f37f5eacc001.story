A Texas man who went on the run in 2007 after being sentenced to 23 years in prison for murdering his girlfriend, has been caught in India.

Amit Livingston was found guilty of killing Hermila Hernandez in 2005, but when a judge allowed him time to get his affairs in order before starting his sentence, the killer fled.

Livingston, who is now 46, was caught in the Indian city of Hyderabad on Tuesday, and is being held while authorities wait to extradite him.

Victim: Hermila Hernandez was shot in the back of the head in 2005 after she told Livingston she wanted to end their relationship

It is not clear what led authorities to Livingston, who has evaded capture for seven years.

He had been found guilty of shooting Ms Hernandez in the back of the head in September 2005, when she told him she wanted to end their relationship, the Cameron County district attorney's office said.

After shooting the 31-year-old, who had three children, Livingston dumped her body on a beach at South Padre Island.

He disappeared after the judge, Abel Limas, took the 
unusual step of allowing Livingston time to get his affairs in order before 
reporting to prison.

Limas, and the district attorney at the time, 
Armando Villalobos, were both later convicted in a bribery conspiracy.

'The mishandling of the Livingston case 
and flight from justice were the cornerstone and the centerpiece of the 
corruption scandal suffered by Cameron County,' District Attorney Luis 
Saenz said in a statement.

'With the convictions that followed in 
federal court, the citizens of Cameron County were ready to turn the 
page and move forward, but something was still missing: the capture of 
Amit Livingston.'

The scheme that allowed Livingston to escape featured prominently in the federal corruption trial of Villalobos.

Villalobos had arranged to have a friend and former law partner represent the interests of Ms Hernandez's three children in a related lawsuit.

By agreeing to convict and sentence Livingston on the same day, Limas freed up the $500,000 bond that had been posted for his release before trial.

An agreement was reached to use that bond money to settle the lawsuit. The lawyer representing the children took $200,000 of it in fees, passing $80,000 to Villalobos and $10,000 to Limas.

At Villalobos' sentencing in February, Hermila Garcia, the victim's mother, told the judge: '[Villalobos] robbed us of justice to sell the murderer his freedom.'

Villalobos was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Limas, who pleaded guilty to racketeering, received six years in prison.
