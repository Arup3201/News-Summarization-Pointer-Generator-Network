A mother and grandmother used rolling pins, umbrellas and vacuum cleaner parts as weapons during a running battle with neighbours in a dispute over a conservatory.

Up to 20 people were involved in the brawl which spilled out into a street, bringing a dual carriageway to a halt.

At one point a mother-of-four was seen hunched over a man, beating him with a vacuum cleaner attachment, a court heard.

A court heard how there was a 'constant history of bickering' between mother-of-four Nazia Akhtar, grandmother Zhaida Hussain, their relatives and the Ahmed family next door. 

The source of the conflict was a conservatory the Ahmeds built as an extension on the rear of their semi-detached home in Levenshulme, Manchester, which their neighbours blamed for causing damp in their property.

The Ahmeds believed the other family were 'jealous' of the building work they had done and both clans installed CCTV on their homes to keep an eye on each other.

Vicious fighting broke out between men from both sides outside the adjoining homes on March 31.

Hussain, 52, was seen rushing in and out of her house 'gathering weapons' as the fight moved into the middle of a busy road, a judge at Manchester Crown Court was told 

The grandmother hurled an umbrella and sticks, one of which narrowly missed a mother with a child, and armed a teenage relative, Mohammed Abbas, the court heard.

Akhtar threw a rolling pin and a shoe from the porch of her home before charging into the street and flinging a vacuum cleaner attachment, which hit a passing vehicle.   

She was later seen hunched over an unidentified man, hitting him with the hoover accessory.

The 31-year-old mother then ran into the central reservation and thumped several men from the Ahmed family.

Efforts to restrain her failed and she returned to her home to throw more sticks and another umbrella at her neighbours. 

After the battled ended, eight people from both families were arrested and charged, with police using footage from their own cameras to build the case against them. 

Sentencing, Recorder Rowena Goode said: 'The background to this incident was ongoing hostility between two households which had been going on for some time, and apparently related to an extension to one of the houses.'

Akhtar (left) and Hussain (right), as well as Mahmood, all admitted affray in the incident which saw vacuum cleaner attachments used as makeshift weapons

Zhaida Hussain, 52, from Burnage, was sentenced to a two-year community order and 120 hours unpaid work.

Nazia Akhtar, 31, from Longsight, was handed a 12-month community order with 140 hours unpaid work and Arshad Mahmood, 26, of Levenshulme, got a 12-month community order with 80 hours unpaid work.

All admitted affray, while Akhtar also admitted criminal damage.

Mohammed Abbas, 31, of  Levenshulme, got a 12-month community order with 60 hours unpaid work. Abrar Ahmed, 19, and Waqar Ahmed, 21, both of Levenshulme, were conditionally discharged for two years. Umar Ahmed, 17, of Levenshulme, and Mohammed Hassan, 17, from Fallowfield, got six-month referral orders. All admitted public order offences.
