A Texas family is demanding answers from police who responded to their home after its alarm system was activated - and shot dead their beloved dog.

Hope and Russell Lane were stunned when Round Rock Police phoned them to say there had been an 'incident' concerning their Rottweiler, Bullet, at their home on Friday.

The eight-year-old pet had been shot five times after officers fired seven bullets inside the home.

'I'm just standing here trying to figure out how to start our life over. Without our son, our dog,' Mrs Lane told My Fox Austin.

Loss: Bullet the Rottweiler was shot dead when police stormed his family's home after its alarm was activated

Shock: One of Bullet's owners, Hope Lane, said the eight-year-old dog had never been aggressive to anyone

The Lanes' granddaughter had forgotten to shut the door all the way after she left for school that morning, leaving the door to blow open and trigger the alarm, KVUE reported.

Mr Lane disarmed the alarm from his cell phone at work, but officers still responded to the address.

Surveillance footage taken outside the family's home shows one officer cautiously opening the front door before shouting inside and reaching for his gun. Two other officers follow him inside.

Round Rock authorities said they came across the 120-pound Rottweiler, who became aggressive toward them. They fired seven bullets.

By the time Mrs Lane returned home, Bullet was gone and his blood had been cleaned up. There were bullet holes in the wall and on the couch where he slept.

'I thought my dog would still be there,' she said. 'I may have wanted to bury my dog in my backyard. Who told you to take my dog away?'

Response: Surveillance footage outside the home shows responding officers pushing open the front door

Attack: A group of police officers grab their guns and enter the home, where Bullet was shot 5 times

Heading out: The police officers are seen leaving the house after they killed the beloved pet dog

She added that there was a sign outside the home reading, 'Rottweilers on duty'. It is displayed in a front window by the door, but officers said they did not see it.

'I obviously have a sign that I have a dog,' she said. 'You know to be cautious [when you see it].'

The couple also insisted that the dog, who suffered from hip dysplasia, was not aggressive. Images of the family on Facebook show him licking the relatives' faces.

Officers have met with the family to explain what happened, but the family continues to seek justice and demand that responding officers are better trained to deal with dogs.

Round Rock authorities are still investigating the incident.

Home: The alarm had been activated when the couple's granddaughter failed to shut the door properly

Evidence: The couple returned home to find Bullet and his blood had gone - but bullet holes still remained

Loved: Bullet, who suffered from hip dysplasia, was a gentle and affectionate dog, his owners said

The Lanes plan to hold a candlelight vigil for Bullet next Saturday night at their home.

In a post on the Facebook group, Justice for Bullet, Mr Lane posted a short poem he had written about the dog.

'On Friday I lost a friend, the kind of friend that never complained about where we were going or how long we'd stay,' it read in part.

'We would walk late in the evening and he would sometimes pull me along the way, and at each corner with a wave of my hand he would sit and stay... He loved me unconditionally.'
