Life-saving equipment more commonly used for humans has been used to rescue a cat from peril. 

Firefighters from Fort Worth Fire Department in Texas placed a tiny oxygen mask on a feline name Stubby after he got caught in a blazing house fire on Friday.

The feline, who was suffering from smoke inhalation, was revived via CPR and taken to vets for further evaluation.

No humans were hurt in the burnout, which occurred around 11:40am.

Lieutenant Kyle Falkner says firefighters found Stubby while trying to bring flames under control. 

It took about half-an-hour to extinguish the fire completely.

Stubby was extricated but had breathed in harmful gases, so firefighters administered oxygen via a mask. 

It's becoming more common for fire departments to have pet oxygen masks, so animal victims can receive on-the-spot treatment along with their owners.

Damages to the Fort Worth home and its contents were estimated at $100,000.

Authorities are trying to determine what sparked the fire.
