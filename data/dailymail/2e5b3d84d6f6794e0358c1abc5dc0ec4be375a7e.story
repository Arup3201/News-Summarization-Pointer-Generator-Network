What appear to be three bodies have been spotted on Mount Rainier in an area where six climbers went missing earlier this summer, National Park officials said Tuesday.

The bodies were seen last week during a helicopter flight by park staff members, park spokeswoman Patti Wold said, adding that officials were trying to determine how to recover them without endangering rescuers.

'Rock and ice fall off the steep wall and an increase in new crevasses in the glacier below make this one of the most hazardous locations in the park,' Wold wrote in an email.

Authorities believe the two guides and four climbers fell 3,300 feet during the dangerous climb in Washinton during the last week of May.

Six climbers, including two guides, are now 
believed to have fallen more than 3,000 feet to their deaths while 
ascending Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano in Washington state

During the initial search, crews found gear and detected signals from avalanche beacons buried in the snow at the top of Carbon Glacier at 9,500 feet.  It's unknown whether a rock fall or avalanche was to blame for the fall.

All six people were experienced climbers who were taking a technical, challenging route to the top of the 14,410-foot (4,392-meter) mountain southeast of Seattle.

Known as the Liberty Ridge route, it is not currently being climbed due to unstable conditions caused by increased rock and icefall from warm weather, Wold said.

Last year, about 10,800 people attempted to climb Mount Rainier and only 129 used the Liberty Ridge route, according to park statistics. The vast majority use two other popular routes.

The missing climbers had traveled from as far away as Singapore, Minnesota and New York to ascend the glacial peak.

The climbers were last heard from via satellite phone about two days into their journey, when they had reached a height of 12,800 feet

Members of the group were Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International guides Matthew Hegeman and Eitan Green; Erik Britton Kolb, a 34-year-old finance manager at American Express, who had traveled from New York; Uday Marty, a vice president and managing director of Intel in Southeast Asia who was based in Singapore; Seattle mountain climber John Mullally; and Mark Mahaney, of St. Paul, Minnesota.

Wold said that the Chinook flight out of Joint Base Lewis McChord was part of the park's ongoing limited search of the area for the climbers.

According to his biography on Intel's website, Mr Marty, 40, managed sales and marketing in the region and had previously managed global notebook marketing out of the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

He joined the company in 1996.

The firm's spokesman Bill Calder said he was 'widely loved and respected at this company.

'We are most definitely mourning his loss here,' he added.

'He was a guy with a great attitude, and he always had a big smile.'

Alpine Ascents identified Matthew Hegeman, the lead guide as intense and philosophical with a good sense of humor. Another guide, Eitan Green, was described as being a 'strong leader' and quick to smile, the website said.
