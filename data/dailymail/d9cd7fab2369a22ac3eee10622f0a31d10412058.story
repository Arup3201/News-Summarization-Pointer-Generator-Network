You could almost see the collective wince in the away end at Loftus Road. 

The calf injury sustained by Vincent Kompany in midweek presented a problem much bigger than Manchester City merely missing their leader - it brought Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala together. A scary prospect indeed.

These are two central defenders with genuine ability, but for whatever reason continue to turn in disastrous performances and undermine the Premier League champions’ credibility.

They had never played a league fixture alongside each other before Saturday evening - and it showed.

This was as bad as it could possibly get - a shambles from start to finish. Two men who didn’t talk to each other, engulfed with the jitters. Memories of the difficulties endured against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup are still fresh. 

The really startling fact is that these chasings haven’t come against a team with the quality of a Chelsea - they find themselves in a mess when met with sides who will finish the season in the bottom half.

Kompany himself - who watched on solemnly alongside Richard Wright - has been nowhere near his commanding best this season, but his absence shows just why Manuel Pellegrini won’t be lifting the title come May.

They need to admit their mistakes in the transfer market and go out in January to sign a partner for Kompany - one who can slot in immediately and rid us of this ludicrous facade.

The way in which Mangala was pulled apart by the combination of Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin makes the £32million paid to Porto in the summer a laughable amount.

Mangala’s only bit of positive defending was a last-ditch tackle to clear as Austin raced through. Even then he had been caught the wrong side in the direct place.

Writing 23-year-old Mangala off already - three months into his career in English football - would be wrong, but they cannot go on with him in this frame of mind. With each passing week he gets worse, he looks increasingly nervous and makes more mistakes.

It took just eight minutes for the two to be guilty of ball-watching as the offside Austin headed beyond Joe Hart. City did have a high line which caught the striker out, but neither had tracked him. Neither had a clue where he was.

And they did exactly the same moments later when Austin was free, 12 yards out, but thwarted brilliantly by the goalkeeper. That particular inquest went as far as a a shrug. Time and again a QPR man go in between them.

City were shaken. There was no confidence emanating from Hart - who found himself in all sorts of trouble. Kompany is the man to rally in that situation, but Mangala and Demichelis shrank, with hands on hips, gormless expressions and puzzled eyes.

The Argentine was absent without leave when Austin finally got his goal; it was difficult to miss the former Swindon Town frontman running between the centre-halves, but Demichelis stood and watched with a hand up. Not offside, and not clever. He looked lost, not a man who has starred in a World Cup final.

It’s a worrying trait and does beg the question as to the whereabouts of Matija Nastasic, who hasn’t featured in the Premier League since January.

The Serbian is 21 but showed he is infinitely more consistent than those ahead of him. Pellegrini clearly doesn’t fancy him, but may have to re-think that assessment sharpish. Or just hope Kompany is back fit and firing after the

international break. Because my word, do they need him.

Demichelis ended up putting through his own net. Somehow, it felt oh so fitting.
