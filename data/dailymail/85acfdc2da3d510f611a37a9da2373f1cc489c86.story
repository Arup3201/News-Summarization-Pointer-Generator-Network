A British engineer is hoping 21st century technology will finally uncover the multimillion pound 'loot of Lima' which has eluded generations of intrepid adventurers.

Shaun Whitehead is heading up an archaeological expedition to try to uncover treasure buried on the Pacific island of Cocos worth an estimated £160million.

The plunder could contain 113 gold religious statues, 200 chests of jewels, 273 swords with jewelled hilts, 1,000 diamonds, solid gold crowns, 150 chalices and hundreds of gold and silver bars.

But finding it will be no easy task for Mr Whitehead and his 15 strong team of researchers from the University of Costa Rica and the Senckenberg Institute.

For nearly two centuries a string of famous explorers have led failed attempts to find the hidden stash on the uninhabited island, situated about 350 miles off the coast of Costa Rica.

Depression era U.S. President Franklin Roosevolt, swashbuckling Australian actor Errol Flynn and racing driver Sir Malcolm Campbell all tried and failed to locate the treasure in the 20th century.

German explorer, August Gissler spent 
nearly two decades living on the island attempting to hunt the treasure
but returned home with just six gold coins.

However, according to The Sunday Telegraph Mr Whitehead is hopeful that hi-tech machinery will be able to pinpoint the spot where British seafarer Captain William Thompson buried the immensely valuable items in 1820.

The team plan to use a small, unmanned helicopter, fitted with specialist cameras, to fly above the nine mile square island, to make a computer-generated 3D map of the landscape.

A snakelike robot will be dragged across likely 'hotspots' and use radar to detect voids and cavities up to a depth of 60ft. The information will be combined with the map to identify possible submerged caves.

Once possible spots have been selected, a 'keyhole' drill will drive through up to 100ft of soil and a one-inch wide probe camera will be sent down to act as an underground treasure eye.

The 10-day expedition will also involve extensive archaeological, geological and ecological research and Mr Whitehead is eager to point out that the quest is not solely for treasure, but also to carry out ecological, geological and archaeological research.

Mr Whitehead said: ''Given the amount of treasure, it would 
have been too heavy to carry far from sea level and stories suggest the 
use of caves. We can also rule out where others have looked, dug up and 
detected – like on the beaches.

'If it is there, it will be in a natural cave which was hidden by one of the many landslides that occur on the island.

"It is not a case of following a map and 'X' marking the spot. It is 
about using a bit of logic to establish the likelihood of some areas 
where it could be."

The nine-mile square island is the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel Treasure Island 
and the modern blockbuster dinosaur film Jurassic Park.

Such is the beauty and wealth of wildlife on the Pacific paradise it is classified as a Unesco World Heritage status site and it took Mr Whitehead around 18 months of negotiation with Costa Rican authorities to get permission to lead the first mission there in 25 years.

Mr Whitehead runs an engineering company which provides specialist electronic exploration equipment.

While the team are funding the expedition themselves, they hope a television company may help to cover the overheads.

The quest will begin in November after the end of the rainy season and anything discovered will be passed on to the Costa Rican Government who will be expected to pay the salvage costs.

The treasure had originally been accrued by the Spaniards in Lima, now the capital of Peru, but in the face of a revolt, the city’s viceroy, José de la Serna, asked Captain Thompson to ship the valuable goods to the Spanish colony of Mexico.

However, after leaving the port of Callao on the Mary Dear, Thompson killed the viceroy's six men and took a new course to the Cocos island.

Once there they buried the treasure, planning to return at a later date. However they were captured by a Spanish warship and all the crew members bar Thompson and his second in command were executed for piracy.

In return for their lives the pair said they would show the Spaniards the location of the loot, but after landing back on the Cocos they fled their captors.

They are said to have been picked up by a passing ship a year later, but without the treasure.
