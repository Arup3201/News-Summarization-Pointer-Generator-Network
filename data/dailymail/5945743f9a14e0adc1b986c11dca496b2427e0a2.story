Mr Nguyen, who was working nearby chased after the man, but lost him. Another witness who was also working in the area Luis Urista  went to Mr Reilly.

'I saw the guy was laying face down on the ground. I knew he got shot. There was some blood coming out,' Mr Urista told the news channel.

Mr Urista said a number of employees working nearby brought out towels and stayed with Mr Reilly until ambulance crews arrived. He was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge where he remains in critical condition. 

'I don't think it's something you'd expect to see, I wouldn't say broad daylight, it was six. Guy must've been desperate or something,' Mr Urista added.

Police have said the store has been robbed two other times previously, but those crimes were not reported. They say their investigation into the shooting is ongoing and additional charges could be filed.
