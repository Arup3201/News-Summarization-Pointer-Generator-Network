After last weekend's stalemate at Aston Villa brought an end to Manchester United's six-match winning run, manager Louis van Gaal admitted that his side remain some way short of a force capable of winning the Barclays Premier League title.

'When you want to be a part of the title race, you have to win these games,' said Van Gaal, cutting straight to the point, 'I saw Manchester City's first half against Crystal Palace, they struggled but 3-0, that is the difference.'

Following Chelsea's 2-0 victory at Stoke City on Monday evening, United fell 10 points behind Jose Mourinho's team. Given Mourinho's remarkable Yuletide record - on the seven occasions his side have been on top at Christmas, they have gone on to win the league title - it would take a considerable lapse of common sense to now back Van Gaal to negotiate a ten-point swing and secure the league title in his first season in charge.

There is a need to tread carefully with such comparisons but, on the flipside, some may point out that Manchester United were only eight points off the pace at the same stage last season under David Moyes. It should, however, be noted that Moyes' tally of 28 points from 17 games would have left United 14 behind this season's pacesetters Chelsea. Regardless, very would argue that Manchester United, as a football club, were in a healthier position this time last year.

Noetheless, for all Van Gaal's progressive work with this Manchester United squad, this Sportsmail study reveals that only once before have the Red Devils found themselves so far adrift from first place on Christmas Day, with the Dutchman equalling the 10 point deficit that Sir Alex Ferguson slumped to in the 1995/96 season.

It may not, however, be the most distressing omen. For that season transpired to be one of the most memorable and dramatic in the modern era, as United reversed Newcastle's advantage - Kevin Keegan 'I would love it...' et al - and went on to be crowned Champions.

United supporters may also take hope from the fact that eight of their thirteen title triumphs under Sir Alex Ferguson came despite failing to achieve first place at Christmas. In 1992/93, for Ferguson's first title win, United were 5 points off the pace on Christmas Day, as they were in 1998/1999 when they went on to secure a Treble. 

Intriguingly, Van Gaal's 32 points from 17 games eclipses the 31 points that Ferguson's most celebrated squad in 1999 had taken from their opening 18 games. In 2008/09, a United squad featuring Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez were seven points behind Liverpool at Christmas, although they did have two games in hand.

United lost 3-2  to Middlesbrough in December 1998 - a result that saw them five points adrift in the table

United's challenge this season, however, appears considerably more testing. Chelsea are made up of such mighty specimens, such powerful characters - Mourinho, Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa - that it is almost impossible to believe that doubt could corrode their resolve. 

Even if they were to slip up, it is then equally difficult to imagine Manchester City also allowing their neighbours a run at the title. And even if these unlikely events were to transpire, does anybody really believe this United squad - beset by deficiencies in defence and injuries throughout - has the potential to amass the necessary points?

Perhaps most ominous for United - despite their reputation for accelerating into gear in the second half of the campaign - is that they were rarely able to claw back Mourinho's Chelsea. In both the 2004/2005 and the 2005/2006 season, Ferguson's United were nine points behind Chelsea on Christmas Day. The first time around, United ended up 18 points off Chelsea by the end of the season while in the 2005/06 season, United could only cut the deficit to eight points come the final day of the campaign.

It should, of course, be said that Van Gaal's principal target for this first season has always been Champions League qualification but the results of recent weeks might just have had some Manchester United supporters wondering.

Last week at Aston Villa provided a dose of reality and all logic now points to a second consecutive season without the Premier League title at Old Trafford.
