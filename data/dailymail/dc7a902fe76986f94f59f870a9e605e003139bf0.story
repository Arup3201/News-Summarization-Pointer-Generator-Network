Wolves entered this match with an undefeated record in the league at Molineux all calendar year and with top spot in the Championship in sight.

By full-time they had neither, beaten by a team buoyed under the management of Chris Powell and with Grant Holt at his bristling best.

Conor Coady scored the goal of the night, a glistening strike from almost 30 yards that curled into the top corner to illustrate why he had been on Liverpool’s books until this summer.

But the plaudits should go to Powell, whose treatment at Charlton reflects in even poorer a light given his start at Huddersfield, and Holt, who was a nuisance all night.

Powell made a big call to replace Nahki Wells, who scored twice to beat Millwall on Saturday, with Holt, who arrived on loan from Wigan last week. But having studied Wolves’ draw with Reading he believed the 33-year-old’s physical presence would do damage. He was right.

Holt created the first goal in the 21st minute, simply proving too strong for Richard Stearman as the pair raced for a bouncing ball down the touchline. One shoulder barge sent the Wolves defender to the floor and enabled Holt to fire a cross that was converted by Harry Bunn.

‘He won’t be wearing the armband, but he’s a leader,’ said Powell of the player who was at Aston Villa last season. ‘I’m quite surprised but happy we were able to get him. He brings intelligence, link-up play, goals, and assists as he showed.’

The loan move runs out on November 8 but don’t be surprised to see Powell extend it. The goal sent Huddersfield on their way to a second win on the bounce to lift them clear of the relegation zone. Not since MK Dons claimed all three points last December had Wolves lost here in the league, having won all four Championship home games this season.

But despite shining brightly in periods, Kenny Jackett can only accept the visitors deserved the win for sheer ruthlessness. It extends a hoodoo Huddersfield seem to hold over Wolves, this their seventh consecutive victory in fixtures between the sides.

Yannick Sagbo’s capture on loan until January should prove a shrewd piece of business by Jackett. This was his first game since signing from Hull and within 17 seconds he almost produced instant payback, but his shot flew wide.

Wolves went closer in the sixth minute, Sam Ricketts cutting in from the right and smacking the post with a left-foot shot from 20 yards.

But Bunn opened the scoring and in the 39th minute hesitant Wolves defending allowed Holt to poke a pass into the box that struck Stearman’s hand. Referee Philip Gibbs could have awarded a penalty but in an instant Sean Scannell ran onto the ball and hit a finish that took a deflection off Danny Batth to beat Ikeme at his near post.

After the interval Jacob Butterfield brought a fine save from Ikeme with an effort from distance and then Coady showed his class.

Jack Robinson’s cross was headed clear only as far as the 21-year-old, who took one touch and bent a wonderful shot that left Ikeme no chance. Bakary Sako pulled one back, finishing between the legs of Smithies from Dicko’s pass, but it was in vain.

‘I was disappointed with our response to those goals,’ said Jackett. ‘We looked shell-shocked. It knocked us too much. I’m looking for a better reaction.’
