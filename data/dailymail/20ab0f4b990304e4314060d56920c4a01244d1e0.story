A psychiatrist may be pushing his own sanity to the very limit after working an average of 110 hours a week throughout an entire year.

Dr. Quazi Rahman, 55, a psychiatrist at Kings County Hospital, New York, earned $515,700 in overtime during 2009 and claims on one occasion to have worked for 96 hours straight.

With a base salary of $173,503 it means Rahman took home a total of $689,203 from the public purse in a single year.

Dr Quazi Rahman worked an average of 110 hours a week throughout an entire year, earning $515,700 in overtime during 2009

Time sheet records show on one occasion he clocked up 141 hours in a single week, leaving him less than four hours a day off.

The documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Law, show Raham, worked a total of 3,820 hours overtime during 2009.

It
 means he almost tripled his working hours by putting in an additional 
73 hours a week, on top of his regular 40-hour schedule.

In one period starting on March, 2, he is reported to have worked 55 days in a row without a single day off.

Then
 during a week in April he managed to top even that by toiling for 141 
hours straight, including four non-stop days working 24 hours solid.

But he was far from finished, racking up 116 hours the following week and 130 hours more the week after that.

However following an investigation by the New York Post the city Health and Hospitals Corporation checked his time sheets and discovered 80 hours worth of discrepancies.

He was ordered to hand back $10,800 and pay an additional $10,800 penalty. Official said that as a precaution they would review the time sheets of other staffers in the department.

However the HHC defended Rahman claiming the money that was overpaid was most likely the result of a coding mistake.

They said Rahan was capable of working the mammoth shifts by sleeping on the premises when things were quiet.

HHC spokeswoman Ana Marengo told the Post: 'He consistently worked 15 hours a day and sometimes more, which is not uncommon for some physicians during parts of their career, particularly if they can be on call.

'Although the hospital is generally busy, his on-call responsibilities in the inpatient unit allowed him periods of rest when there was down time.'

During 2010 Raham's overtime fell to a mere 1,959 hours meaning he earned just $438,000 after the hospital recruited additional psychiatric staff.
