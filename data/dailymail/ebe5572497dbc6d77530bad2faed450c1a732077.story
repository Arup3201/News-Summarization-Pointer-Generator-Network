Using a microwave can be tricky. Unless it's a ready-meal, you're forced to hazard a guess about cooking times.

Standing in front of the microwave and testing the temperature of a dish over and over can be tedious - and if it's not piping hot in the middle the food can be a health hazard too.

But now a solution is in sight. An inventor has designed a next generation  microwave that uses infrared cameras to tell you when your food is irradiated to perfection.

The innovative invention has an LCD screen that shows you how hot your food is, so you know when to take it out.

And it can also send information to your phone, so you can instruct your microwave to cook for longer remotely if needed. 

The Heat Map Microwave was created by former Nasa engineer Mark Rober.

For now the concept is only in a prototype stage, but people can register their interest at the website Better Microwave. 

In a video showing off the product, he laments the lack of innovation in the microwave since its invention almost 50 years ago.

‘[The microwave] has pretty much remained unchanged since its inception in 1967,’ he said.

‘And that’s a shame, because there are quite a few sucky things about it.’

Kitchen chain £34.99 Lakeland has devised a gadget that combines two cooking methods that have transformed family meal times and can deliver a tasty curry or chilli con carne in just 20 minutes.

It is a pressure cooker that slides into a microwave and cooks everything from raw meat to jams, marmalades and steam puddings at incredibly high temperatures.

The net effect is a super-fast cooking machine that could even replace the supermarket ready meal. 

He notes that, with current microwaves, it is difficult to know exactly when food is done.

‘Basically, unless you stop the microwave and pull your food out to inspect it, there’s no way to tell if it’s done just right.’

His invention uses an infrared camera in the top of the microwave, and sends information to an LCD screen on the front of the microwave.

Here it displays a heat map that starts blue, because the food is cold, and transitions to white hot, when the food is hot.

The microwave can also be programmed to turn off when the food it is cooking becomes all white in temperature.

And via Bluetooth or Wifi, the heat map can be beamed to your phone, so you can display the same screen on there.

From your phone you can then add another 30 seconds if the food doesn’t look like it has cooked enough.

The LCD screen can also be used to display recipes or play cooking videos. 

There's no news yet, though, on when the innovative microwave might be released to the public, or how much it is likely to cost.
