Lewis and McMahan, both of St. Petersburg, have been charged with disorderly conduct and battery on a law enforcement officer, according to The Denver Channel.

The website says Pinellas County Sheriff's Office is ‘investigating’ but has not made further comment.

Lewis is quoted as saying that he tried to intervene fearing his friend had passed out.

He also denied assaulting the officer.

Wtsp said police were called amid reports beachgoers were being threatened.

Visitor George Voucas told the website: ‘The cop was alone. Luckily he was a big guy. To be honest, if he wasn't the size he was I don't think he would've been able to handle the situation.’
