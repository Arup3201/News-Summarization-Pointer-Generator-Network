Ivan Rakitic says he is happy to fill Sergio Busquets' role as a holding midfielder as Barcelona head into the business end of the season.

The Croatian has been used all around the midfield since joining from Sevilla last summer, and looks likely to be used at the base of Barcelona's formation in the coming weeks.

Sergio Busquets picked up an injury last week, Javier Mascherano is just one booking away from a suspension, while Andres Iniesta has admitted that he and Xavi no longer function effectively in the same team.

It means that Rakitic will probably in the central holding role against Eibar this season, and he could make the position his own while Busquets recovers.

'It wouldn't be anything new for me to play in that role,' he said. 'I played there for my country last season.

'It's a different position and it demands different skills, but I know the position very well.

'As the pivot you have to cover the defenders who come out with the ball, help them if there isn't an easy way out and watch the backs of the team mates you have in front of you.

'You have to help the team in whatever position you play. The important thing is to be out on the pitch, I want to play every game.'

After the trip to Eibar, Barca take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday and host Real in La Liga the following Sunday.
