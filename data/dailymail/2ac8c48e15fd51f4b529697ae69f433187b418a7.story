Neil Lennon has attributed Celtic’s dismal Champions League defeat in Poland to a lack of investment in the first-team squad.

Speaking after a 4-1 first leg loss to Legia Warsaw left Scotland’s champions with a mountain to climb to reach the play-off round, the former Parkhead boss claimed it was an accident waiting to happen.

Before leaving his post in May, the Northern Irishman spoke publicly on the dangers of failing to replace key players such as Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama and Joe Ledley.

Crushing: Celtic players leave the field after losing 4-1 to Legia Warsaw in the first leg of third round qualifying

As new 
manager Ronny Deila faced questions over his team selection in Wednesday
 night’s debacle, his predecessor claimed a heavy defeat in the tricky 
qualifiers would have happened sooner or later.

‘I
 wouldn’t say it was inevitable, but I think it might have been on the 
cards,’ he said. ‘There has been no investment at the minute in the team
 and Ronny really hasn’t had much time to bed himself in with John 
Collins and get to know the players.

‘Those
 qualifiers are always really tricky and it took me a year or two. I 
remember Gordon Strachan in his first game losing 5-0 to Artmedia in 
Bratislava. He won the second leg 4-0 – but it was too big a gap to 
recover.

‘So it can happen. They are not out of the tie, but they are going to have to play supremely well to get through now.’

Failure
 to overcome the deficit would see Celtic drop into a Europa League 
play-off clash and lose a potential £15million in European revenues.

Lennon
 believes the club have insulated themselves against that by storing 
away the cash from previous campaigns. But failure could increase the 
chances of Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk being sold to plug the gap
 and impact on the club’s attendances in the coming season.

Admitting
 he left the Celtic job because domestic football no longer stirred his 
competitive urges, Lennon – who led the club to three successive titles -
 added: ‘I think the Champions League is always important. It gives the 
fans and players something to look forward to.

‘There
 is the money side as well, but the club is financially healthy. They 
can maybe take the hit on not making the Champions League this year.  I 
don’t think it will be disastrous.

‘But
 in terms of the football angle, it’s imperative to stay in there and 
qualify if they can. I was player, coach, manager and it was a huge part
 of my life. But in the end we won the league by 30 points last season 
and I just thought it was maybe a good time to leave and look for a 
different challenge.

‘We
 felt, myself and the backroom team, that the challenge wasn’t really 
there. We had a great time in the Champions League, but we struggled a 
little bit for competition.’

Legia Warsaw’s Ivica Vrdoljak missed two penalties – with Forster saving the second to keep Celtic’s slender hopes alive.

But the Polish club’s captain says Henning Berg’s side will finish the job professionally at Murrayfield next Wednesday.

‘I’m
 positive we can now finish the job in Scotland,’ said Vrdoljak. ‘We 
were comfortable at home and played very well with the goals from Miro 
Radovic helping us to settle down.

‘But
 we are aware it is half-time and that Celtic came back against Shakhtar
 Karagandy last season. That means we must concentrate for the 90 
minutes. We believed in ourselves and I don’t know what was wrong with 
Celtic.’

Vrdoljak apologised to his team-mates for wasting the penalties, but vowed to take another in Edinburgh if it comes.

‘I think in the future I will score – in fact if we get one in Edinburgh t I will take it and this time I will score no problem.

‘This
 was just one of those nights, but like the team I have faith in my 
ability. Worse things happen in life than missing a penalty and I thank 
my team-mates for saving me.

‘I apologised to them afterwards but we were together as a team and were all able to laugh because of the final result.’

Meanwhile,
 sources close to Celtic striker Anthony Stokes have played down claims 
of a bust-up between the player and manager Deila after he was left on 
the bench against Warsaw.

Teemu
 Pukki and new loan signing Jo Inge Berget were given the nod to start 
in the 4-1 defeat and both were replaced during the game - although 
Stokes did not see any action.
