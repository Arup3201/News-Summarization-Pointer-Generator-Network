You would think that flying around the world in a sleigh with reindeer, going down chimneys and eating all those mince pies would be among the most serious health hazards for Father Christmas.

But poor old Santa has been banned from sitting on his float in Sutton, south London, after a health and safety assessment found it to be too dangerous - so he will have to walk alongside instead.

The ruling brings to an end a 46-year tradition in the town, and a plastic Santa will be placed on the float instead - while the human Santa walks alongside the float, collecting money from residents.

The Cheam Round Table's fundraising float has been a highlight of the festive calendar, raising more than £130,000 for local charities since it started in 1966.

In recent years it has been taken over the Rotary Club of Cheam, and after a health and safety assessment this year they ruled it was too dangerous for Santa to sit on top of the 10ft float.

The float used to travel at walking pace around residential streets of Cheam and Worcester Park with a volunteer dressed as Father Christmas on top of it in the three-week run up to Christmas.

In previous years he stood inside the vehicle, with his upper body above the sun roof - but there are concerns this year over a new vehicle that meant he would have to sit in a bolted-down chair.

Grounding Santa has caused a row with former members of Cheam Round Table, which set up the tradition in 1966, and passed over running the float to the rotary club in 2009.

An insurance firm willing to insure the float with Santa on top was found, but the rotary club still decided to scrap the tradition.

Jeff Jones who is the chairman of Cheam 41, a group made up of former Round Table members, said: ‘The float has been going for 40-odd years and Father Christmas has never fallen off.

There were various predecessors to the modern-day Father Christmas who we know.

One was the Norse God Odin, who had a blue cloak and white beard. He rode through the winter world and gave gifts or punishments to people, so was both loved and feared.

Then there was the fourth-century Bishop of Myra, also known as Saint Nicholas, who was known for being kind to children and the poor.

Father Christmas has represented kindness and happiness since medieval times.

The Dutch took the story of a legendary gift-bearer called 'Sinterklaas' to the U.S. in the 19th century, where he became known as Santa Claus.

‘I had a big row with [the president of Cheam Rotary], but I couldn't get him to change his mind. I said it was ridiculous. Common sense has gone out of the window.’

Mother-of-three Sara Palmer, 43, from Sutton, has gone to see the float every year since she was a child and said it was a family tradition to visit the sleigh.

She said: ‘Not having him on top for three weeks of the year is ridiculous. The kids were like “Where's Santa?”

'It's just taking the magic out of it and they raise so much money for charity. It was always the highlight of Christmas.’

The sleigh was saved by the Rotary Club of Cheam in 2009 after the closure of its former organisers, the Cheam Round Table.

Peter Bright, 71, from Banstead, is an honorary member of the rotary club and former member of the round table, who still helps to organise its tour each year.

He said he found a company that would insure the sleigh with Father Christmas on top -  but the majority decision taken by the rotary club meant that Santa would not be sitting on the float.

Cheam Rotary Club president Stephen 
Cunningham, 52, from Wallington, who has qualifications in health and 
safety, said: ‘From our point of view it's a serious matter.

‘We didn't take this decision light-heartedly. I work in the construction industry and I have an obligation to make sure everyone goes home safely every night.’

‘We have got a new vehicle this year and someone proposed we had someone sitting on a chair bolted to the roof. But it is very dangerous - not only for us. So we said we couldn't do that.

‘Another rotary club somewhere else in the country had an accident. From my own point of view we have found it better with Santa walking as he is able to interact with the youngsters better.’

Responding to negativity from some ex-Round Table members, he said: ‘They were doing it 30 or 40 years ago when health and safety wasn't such a big issue. You have to adapt to changing times.’
