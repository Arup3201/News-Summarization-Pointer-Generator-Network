Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan have been criticised for sunbathing and playing golf while on the front line.

A senior commander said troops wanted to be treated like 'Roman gladiators' and did not seem to be taking their duties seriously in a stinging attack on the country's military culture.

Tensions in Afghanistan have been rising as an American general warned Western soldiers to expect more insider attacks and a photograph was circulated showing six dead Taliban militants.

Ambush: Western troops have been warned to expect an upsurge in insider attacks in the near future

Lt Col Chris Smith, a leading figure in the Australian army, said many soldiers' perceptions of war were based on misleading imagery found in computer games.

His report on discipline among the troops recorded 'examples throughout Australia's commitment in Afghanistan of soldiers sunbathing in tactical positions, sitting in chairs and facing inwards in enemy areas, listening to music in tactical positions'.

He added that soldiers had been seen playing football and exercising in key areas on the front line between the Taliban and NATO troops, and hitting golf balls into enemy territory.

Australian troops were also criticised for 'greeting helicopters at landing zones in thongs [ie flip-flops] and T-shirts'.

The damning report was published by the head of the army this week so it could serve as a warning to soldiers that they needed to improve their behaviour.

Success: But tensions are rising as the warm weather has hastened the start of the fighting season

In other developments, officials in the southern Helmand province released a grisly image of six Taliban fighters apparently killed by police after attempting to ambush a patrol.

It is believed that the gunfight also involved troops from the NATO coalition, and local tribal leaders claimed that the militants were shot at from helicopters.

Despite efforts to wind down Western involvement in the wartorn country, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan yesterday warned that attacks on his troops were set to get worse.

General Joseph Dunford predicted that recent anti-American comments by president Hamid Karzai would inflame tensions.

'We're at a rough point in the relationship,' he wrote in an email to other U.S. officials.

Mr Dunford also said unusually warm weather could mean an early start to the Taliban fighting season because militants can return from high mountain passes from Pakistan.

Inflammatory: President Hamid Karzai has stepped up his anti-American rhetoric in recent weeks

Mr Karzai defended his controversial remarks, saying: 'My recent comments were meant to help reform, not destroy the relationship.

'We want good relations and friendship with America, but the relationship must be between two independent nations.'

Over the weekend, the Afghan leader accused the U.S. of conspiring with the Taliban on suicide attacks to keep the country unstable and give foreign forces an excuse to stay beyond 2014.

His remarks followed two attacks that killed at least 19 Afghans on Saturday, coinciding with the first official visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Karzai also cautioned this week that the delay in handing over a U.S.-run detention center to Afghan control 'could harm bilateral relations'.
