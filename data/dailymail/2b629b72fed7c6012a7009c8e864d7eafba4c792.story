Improvements needed: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said more must be done

Only in one in four graduates is good at maths and English, a study revealed yesterday.

The dismal results come despite a surge in education spending and record numbers of university students.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that just 25 per cent of Britons with a degree scored highly in a literacy test.

Yet their peers in Japan and Finland scored 37 per cent, the Dutch 36 per cent and Australians 32 per cent. Norway with 28 per cent and Belgium with 26 per cent also fared better. The UK’s position in numeracy was similar or slightly worse.

The OECD said the rise in the number of graduates was not matched by a rise in skill levels. Andreas Schleicher, the policy group’s director for education and skills, said: ‘Not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than those people who have just come out of school.

'UK universities have a very strong reputation – you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled.’

Mr Schleicher suggested schools may partly be to blame: ‘One of the things which may of course be true is that literacy and numeracy reflect things that you learn well before university.

‘In Japan they build the foundations for literacy and numeracy at high school, and universities can build on this.

‘It’s not true for the UK. This may be a reflection of this – universities assume those skills are there, but they might not be.’

It also emerged that the growth in higher education has mainly benefited the middle classes.

A child’s chances of going to university are still strongly influenced by their family background, partly because many disadvantaged children are ‘doomed’ by poor schooling. ‘Many countries are doing better than the UK,’ said Mr Schleicher.

‘The UK has seen huge increases in access but that hasn’t translated into the degree of mobility we have seen in the Russian Federation, in Korea, in Finland, Flanders, France, Ireland and so on.’

Class sizes in British primary schools are among the biggest in the developed world, according to research.

The average teaching group now has 25 pupils – the sixth largest out of 33 countries studied by the OECD.

UK primary classes are bigger than the international average of 21 and significantly larger than countries such as Luxembourg, with 16 per group.

The figures also show that the UK average class creeps up to 26 when private schools are taken out of consideration. In UK independent schools, the average class size is just 15.

At secondary level, class sizes are also comparatively large among 14 to 18-year-olds.

And in nursery education, there are around 19 children per teacher, higher than the OECD average of 14 pupils per teacher.

The figures show there are 17 pupils per teacher in upper secondary classes – the fourth highest out of 29 countries included in the analysis. Only Mexico, Chile and the Netherlands have more pupils per teacher.

The OECD report said there was some evidence smaller classes benefited specific groups of pupils, such as those from poorer backgrounds, but only a ‘weak’ link to pupil performance overall. 

The findings came in the OECD’s annual analysis of international league tables titled ‘Education at a Glance’.

For the first time, the number of graduates outstrips the numbers who stopped studying after gaining their GCSEs or A-levels.

Forty-one per cent of 25- to 64-year-olds have a degree while 37 per cent have no qualification higher than an A-level or equivalent.

The tables also show that while the UK ranks eighth among 36 countries for the number of graduates it produces, the level of basic skills among those with a higher qualification is merely average.

To gauge graduate skill levels, the OECD drew on research published last year which involved setting a sample of adults in nations across the developed world a test in literacy and numeracy. In the UK, only England and Northern Ireland took part in the tests.

Employers have repeatedly complained that both graduates and school-leavers lack the skills in the three Rs needed to succeed in the workplace.

Elsewhere, the OECD report noted that the UK had increased education spending as a percentage of GDP faster than all other OECD countries. But this has so far failed to translate into top scores for our education system.

‘The time that the massive increase in investment actually translates into better outcomes is still to come,’ said Mr Schleicher.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘I’m committed to going further faster towards creating an education system that enables all young people, regardless of background are able to reach their full potential.’
