Ian Burlakoff stretched out on the ground as Officer Robert Cohen pointed a rifle at him, telling the murder suspect not to move.

The Florida father of two had just killed his 37-year-old wife Gemma execution style with two shots of his 9mm semi-automatic pistol — the same gun he now had in his waistband as the Boca Raton police officer tried to gain control of the situation.

Still lying flat on his stomach, Burlakoff looked up at Officer Cohen and shot him a chilling question: 'Where's your backup?'

Then, as a stunned crowd looked on, he began reaching for his pistol and uttered his final words: 'Just kill me.'

Officer Cohen fired eight times — striking Burlakoff four times in the chest, back and arm. Ian, 42, was killed instantly.

The October 2013 shooting marked the tragic end of the troubled eight-year marriage of the Burlakoffs, the doting parents of four young girls and a popular couple in the luxury resort The Oaks, where they owned a $2 million home.

Detectives this week revealed to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel details of the couple's final day, which began with a family day at a beach club — but ended in Gemma's killing and Ian's suicide by police.

Florida couple Ian and Gemma  Burlakoff appeared to have it all, but they were engulfed in domestic crisis - from a contentious divorce to their $2 million being in the brink of repossession - that ended in a murder and suicide by cop on Oct. 20, 2013

The couple had spent that Sunday in 2013 with three of their daughters and another family at the Boca Beach Club, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

Halfway through the day, the couple got into a heated argument. It was perhaps their worst fight since Gemma filed for divorce three months earlier. Each side fired off accusations of cheating and overspending. Gemma said in court that Ian wasn't taking medication for his bipolar disorder.

That Sunday, an upset Ian picked up two of his daughters, 5 and 7, and walked with them down Ocean Boulevard. Onlookers told authorities the girls appeared to be trying to free themselves as the dad wrapped his arms around them.

A few minutes later, Gemma and the couple's friends showed up in an SUV. The wife confronted Ian, giving the girls just enough time to run into the car. The couple continued to argue in the street.

One witness said she saw Ian push Gemma to the ground and pull a gun from his pocket. As the witness drove away, she heard the gun shots — two quick bursts from the 9mm pistol.

A jogger, who at first thought he'd heard fireworks, walked by and saw Ian still with his gun in hand — his dead wife on the ground.

'Get out of here!' Ian told the man, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

The jogger crossed the street, where another witness was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. Soon they'd watch in horror as Officer Cohen granted Ian's death wish.

'He could have waited where he was and complied with the officer's direction,' an investigator wrote, according to the documents revealed by the Sun-Sentinel.

'He would have survived if he had done so, but he must have known he would be arrested for the murder of his wife, spend the rest of his life in prison and live with the guilt of what he did to his young children.'

The Burlakoffs owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury 'The Oaks' resort in Boca Raton and the house was set to be sold at auction if it wasn't paid off in a few months

In court, Gemma Burlakoff said her husband had refused to support their children since she filed for divorce in July 2013. She
 said he refused to pay the mortgage, and threatened to shut the home’s 
power off if she continued having her mother to the house.

She told her family that everything was fine in the days before her shooting death, but relatives said the husband had a gambling habit.

Ian Burlakoff had accused his wife of 'outrageous shopping sprees' during which she would purchase hundreds of pairs of shoes costing upward of $1,000 per pair. Records also show she liked pricey 
purses too, once spending more than $5,000 for a handbag.

In return, she had accused her 
husband of spending $1,000 a week on body waxing and steroids and 
questioned why he had booked a two-bedroom suite at the Waldorf-Astoria 
in Manhattan.

Records show they 
owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury 
The Oaks resort, which was set to be sold at auction if it 
wasn't paid off within a few months.

Ian was a general manager at King Hyundai in Deerfield Beach, 
earning $800,000 a year and was described by stunned employees as a 
devoted father who also did a lot of volunteer work.

Gemma was a stay-at-home mother 
who cared for their three children, at the time aged 1, 5, 7.

Ian also had a 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.

The
 Burlakoffs married in 2005.
