Living in fear: Genet Kidane had begged police to protect her

An illegal immigrant who murdered his ex-lover by pushing her 30ft from a bridge had already been deported from Britain three times.

Younas Beraki shoved mother-of-one Genet Kidane on to a busy dual carriageway because he could not accept that she had ended their relationship.

Only weeks earlier, the failed asylum seeker from Eritrea in North-East Africa had been deported from the UK for a third time – but he smuggled himself straight back into the country in a lorry.

Beraki, 33, has been given a life 
sentence after admitting murder and has been told he will serve at least
12 years in prison before facing deportation for a fourth time.

Last night Miss Kidane’s daughter, 
Senait Gebremichael, demanded to know how Beraki, an alcoholic, was able
to evade border police four times in six years.

She asked: ‘How could he possibly slip through immigration four times?

‘It is unbelievable. We have been let 
down. If they had dealt with him properly then maybe my mother would 
still be alive today.’

Miss Gebremichael, 22, also accused 
the police of being ‘careless’ with her mother’s welfare after she 
repeatedly told them Beraki planned to kill her. ‘My mother and I warned
them so many times that he was a madman, but they did nothing,’ she 
said. ‘They ignored her pleas. She was helpless.’

Miss Kidane, 41, came to the UK with 
her daughter in 2005 after being persecuted for her Christian beliefs in
her native Eritrea and had her asylum application granted.

As well as working long hours as a 
cleaner at a Primark store in Coventry, she spent her spare time 
volunteering with a charity.

The bridge in Coventry from where Beraki pushed Genet Kidane to her death. He was jailed for life after he pleaded guilty to murder

In the months before her death, Miss 
Kidane begged police to protect her from Beraki, who refused to accept 
that she had ended their relationship. She told police that Beraki had 
described in detail how and where he would eventually kill her.

Prosecutor Emma Cutts told Coventry Crown Court: ‘He had said he would come behind her, push her and kill her.

‘She even told the police about the 
very bridge that she subsequently fell to her death from, as this was 
the route for her to go to work, and was frightened he might push her 
off it.’

Last night the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission said it had launched an investigation into the 
police handling of the case.

Beraki first came to the UK six years ago after deserting from the Eritrean army.

He was refused asylum but remained in the country living ‘a feral existence’, the court heard.

Miss Kidane ended their year-long 
relationship in July 2010 because of his drinking problem and his 
‘obsessive’ and ‘controlling’ behaviour – but he continued to harass 
her.

In the months before her murder Miss Kidane repeatedly told police that he was threatening her.

Beraki was also arrested in August 
2010 for hitting a female stranger at a Birmingham New Street railway 
station. He was given a conditional discharge.

In December 2010, Beraki was deported 
for a third time to Italy – but a month later Miss Kidane frantically 
called 999 to say that he had returned and was trying to break into her 
house. In a desperate attempt to escape him, Miss Kidane decided to move
to London but she was killed the day before she left.

She was walking to Primark at 6.50am 
on January 12 when Beraki, who was living in a nearby hostel, attacked 
her on a footbridge over the Coventry ring road.

Miss Gebremichael, who also worked as a
cleaner at the shop, was a short distance behind her mother. She heard 
her mother screaming ‘Why?’ as she was pushed off the bridge and fell 
30ft onto the busy road below.

Moments later, she saw her mother lying dead in the road. Beraki jumped off the bridge, but survived.

Judge Richard Griffiths-Jones told 
him: ‘You were deported from this country but you came back, in my 
judgment, to pursue your obsession of not accepting the end of the 
relationship.

‘When you came back you quickly came 
back to Coventry and to where you knew she [Miss Kidane] was living. 
Your obsessive knowledge about her routine meant that you knew where and
when she would be going to work.

‘And you foreshadowed by what you had 
said to her that you would kill her in the way you eventually did. You 
had decided she would die because if you couldn’t have her, she wouldn’t
have a life of her own.’

The UK Border Agency said it would seek to deport Beraki for a fourth time after he had served his sentence.
