Three homes: John Cruddas once complained about a lack of affordable housing

he Labour Election chief who lambasted Tony Blair for failing to provide enough cheap homes is planning to write the party’s manifesto from his latest new home – one of three he owns worth a total of £1 million.

The latest addition to MP John Cruddas’s portfolio is a self-designed holiday cottage overlooking a beach on a scenic isle off the coast of Ireland.

He has had an office added to the building so he can use it to write Ed Miliband’s General Election manifesto – in between ‘exhilarating’ walks and kite-surfing on the beach.

Regular flights from nearby Knock International Airport mean Mr Cruddas and his wife, Labour peer Baroness Healy, can ‘commute’ the 500 miles to Westminster.

The four-bedroom retreat in County Mayo is in addition to Mr Cruddas’s mansion block flat in West London’s fashionable Notting Hill and a third home in his constituency in Dagenham, East London.

Former union official Mr Cruddas fiercely criticised Tony Blair’s Government for chasing middle-class voters and claimed a ‘lack of affordable social housing’ was its ‘outstanding public policy failure.’

His outspoken views led to Mr Miliband putting Mr Cruddas in charge of a shake up of the Party’s policies and designing and writing its election manifesto.

Mr Cruddas designed his latest home on the beautiful island of Achill and had it built to his specifications, including an open-plan kitchen, dining room and an office.

From there he will be able to work on Labour’s manifesto overlooking a sandy beach instead of hectic Westminster or his tough urban constituency.

‘I am going to bring some of my colleagues here to do a bit of work and get away from it and sort out a few things,’ Mr Cruddas told an Irish journalist. ‘We have quite a big agenda ahead of us over the next couple of years but this will be the perfect place to get things done.’

He said the island setting is ‘one of the most beautiful places you can come across .  .  . a strange type of beauty because it is a wild and ferocious type. There is nothing as exhilarating as walking along the beach, especially on Christmas Day’.

The holiday home, worth about £180,000, is also ideal for two of Mr Cruddas’ other hobbies, golf and fishing. He joined the exclusive, £1,500-a-year Walton Heath golf club in Surrey, once captained by the Duke of Windsor.

His new home is close to the greens of Achill golf club, which promises members ‘beautiful, ever-changing scenery and invigorating Achill air’.

Distance: The MP's new home in Achill, County Mayo, is around 500 miles from Westminster

The area, one of Ireland’s most 
popular holiday destinations, claims to have ‘the best fishing waters in
Ireland’ with mullet, mackerel and skate. It also offers scuba-diving.

Ireland’s
Atlantic coast is one of the furthest points in the British Isles from 
Westminster. In Mr Cruddas’s own words: ‘Next stop New York.’

While
speaking out for Labour’s traditional supporters, Mr Cruddas, 51, and 
wife Anna, who both have Irish roots, are part of Labour’s 
‘aristocracy.’ Mr Cruddas was Mr Blair’s union fixer in No 10 and his 
wife was given a peerage after advising John Prescott and Harriet 
Harman.

As an MP, he earns a salary of £65,000 a year, while peers can claim a £300-per-day attendance allowance.

London: His £650,000 flat near his son's Holland Park school. He bought the property for £375,000 and claimed more than £80,000 expenses towards it

Constituency: The Labour MP's £200,000 terraced home in Dagenham which forms a part of his £1million property portfolio

It
is not the first time the couple have been involved in controversy over
property. In 2007, Mr Cruddas was accused of using his MP’s 
second-homes expenses to fund a London flat which enabled him to obtain 
better schooling for his son.

The
couple bought a home in Notting Hill for £375,000 and claimed more than
£80,000 in expenses on the property, which fell within the catchment 
area of elite Catholic Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School in nearby 
Holland Park. Pupils are required to learn Latin and attend weekly Mass.

The MP was able to make the second-home claims because he nominated his constituency home in Dagenham, worth about £200,000, as his ‘main home’ for expenses purposes.

At around the same time as he bought the Notting Hill flat, now worth up to £650,000, his son began attending Cardinal Vaughan School, known for its excellent results.

The secondary school nearest to Mr Cruddas’s constituency home, Dagenham Park Community School, is one of London’s poorest in terms of results.

Mr Cruddas denied he had moved simply to get his child into the school and said he had ‘always supported Catholic comprehensives’.

He provoked ridicule when he described Labour’s policy review as ‘not policy as such, rather the search for political sentiment, voice and language; of general definition within a national story. Less the Sprit Level, more What is England’.

A spokesman for Mr Cruddas declined to comment.
