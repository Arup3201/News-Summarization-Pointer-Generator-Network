An American defense contractor found dead at the bottom of a Saudi Arabian hotel in January had injuries consistent with homicide, according to a medical exam carried out after his body was returned to the U.S.

Christopher Cramer, 50, of New Hampshire, was found dead on January 15 outside the Sahara Makarim Hotel in the city of Tabuk.

Saudi police have classified Cramer's death as suicide, but just hours before his death he had frantically texted friends in the U.S. begging for help.

'I'm at the Marakim tabuk hotel in Saudi. I think something bad is going to happen to me tonight. Please contact state dept ASAP. Bad things were said,' read the text message.

Family members had disputed the Saudi's verdict and asked Dr. Michael Baden, a Fox News contributor and former chief medical examiner for New York City, to carry out an independent autopsy.

'What I could find was that there were multiple injuries that were not caused by impact alone,' Baden told FoxNews.com.

'When the fall occurs, usually injuries are consistent with the point of impact. There's more than one point of impact.' 

There also appeared to be a blunt force trauma to Cramer's head, something that usually does not occur in a suicide fall, said Baden.

Cramer was in the country to demonstrate and sell an anti-armor missile system when his body was found three stories below his hotel room.

Friends and family of Cramer have maintained that he was a happy person who showed no signs of depression. They are calling for a criminal investigation to be opened.

'It just wasn't right. He would not send a text like that unless he was truly in trouble,' said Cramer's nephew, Chris Arsenault.

'We are going to continue to press for the facts, that he did not fall after committing suicide.'

A State Department spokesperson said the agency has offered to help Saudi authorities in the investigation.

'If the host government grants permission, then the FBI, in conjunction with the State Department, supports the investigative efforts of the foreign government,' the official said.
