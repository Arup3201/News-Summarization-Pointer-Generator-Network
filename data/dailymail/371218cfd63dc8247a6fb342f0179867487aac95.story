Gus Poyet has accused Sunderland’s supporters of pining for Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn and the ‘kick and rush’ football of Peter Reid’s team.

The Black Cats finished seventh in consecutive seasons at the turn of the millennium with Phillips and Quinn forming one of the Premier League’s most feared strike partnerships.

But on Saturday Poyet’s side were booed off at half-time and at the end of a sour stalemate with Fulham, in which Jermain Defoe made his home debut and Jack Rodwell was sent off.

The Uruguayan, though, has some harsh words for the club’s followers.

‘I understand the booing at the end and at half-time probably, but during the game when a team-mate passes the ball, I don’t,’ he said.

‘My message to them is patience. And I am sorry I can’t bring Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips back. I think they (the fans) are still living in the past. You cannot live in the past.

‘On top of that, you have to remember how Peter Reid left the club (sacked in 2002). They forgot very quickly about what Peter achieved, and that is very unfair.’

Poyet, meanwhile, says the high-tempo playing style employed by Reid is now redundant in the modern game.

‘I think it was kick and rush,’ he said. ‘People think they were very good because of the way they played - it was excellent and worked perfectly for Quinn and Phillips in particular.

‘It is a way if playing and I respect it. I suffered myself here, 4-0 at half-time, but I don’t think too many teams in the Premier League play it now.’

Sunderland supporters may well argue that ‘kick and rush’ is better than the dross served up at the Stadium of Light this season, where they have won just once in the league.

And Poyet is concerned about the disconnect with those in the stands.

‘Yes, it worries me,’ he said. ‘It worries me a lot.

‘But it is up to me to find a solution to connect with the fans through better play, whatever that system is, whether through passing, or going long. It is up to me, I am responsible.

‘At the moment it is not nice to watch, I can understand that. All I can say is I promise you I will try to find a way to bring more excitement to the stadium.’
