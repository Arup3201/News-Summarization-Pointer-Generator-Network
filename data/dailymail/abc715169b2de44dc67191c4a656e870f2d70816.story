Police investigating the decapitation of a woman by a lorry have revealed CCTV images of the victim before she was hit and a what appears to be a man seen walking off with her shoes and handbag afterwards.

Witnesses claim they saw an Asian man calmly bending down and picking up the possessions as pandemonium broke out in the aftermath of the tragedy near Manchester Royal Infirmary.

Police are still battling to identify the victim, who was dressed in in traditional Muslim attire, after no one reported a missing woman who matches her description.

A man is seen carrying objects, including shoes, near where the woman was hit. A witness says a man calmly picked up her shoes and handbag - which where catapulted 100 yards from her body - afterwards

She died instantly when she stepped into the path of the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour.

The ensuing impact  propelled her handbag and shoes up to 100 yards from the rest of her body.

The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter.

Police want to track down the man who was captured on CCTV carrying objects including shoes.

Who is she? The victim, wearing traditional clothes, moments before she was hit by a hit-and-run driver

Supt Wasim Chaudhry said: ‘We are really looking to speak to this man who is seen to pick up the ladies shoes and also possibly the handbag, maybe in good faith.

‘That handbag is key to establishing the identity of the victim. We have also looked at missing reports and at the moment there are no matches, so we are reliant on people coming forward.

‘I know the community will be very distressed and I want to reassure them that we have a team of very experienced officers investigating the matter.

‘The gentleman has been seen on CCTV picking up the shoes and then walking away.

‘It may well be the person has put them to one side or taken them for handing them in.

‘They haven't come forward yet with those items.

‘Whilst the incident was on going those shoes have been collected. I can hope that this person has person has done so in good faith maybe thinking it was lost property, maybe handing them in to the police.

‘We haven't had it handed in yet. It's inevitable we will have family members and friends concerned that a loved one hasn't come home. I would urge anyone who is concerned to come forward.

‘At this stage we are still working to identify who this victim was in what is a really tragic case.’

Police were called to the scene at 10am on Thursday on Upper Brook Street in Longsight to find the woman's body parts strewn across the road.

They also discovered the truck driver had driven on apparently oblivious that he had hit the woman.

A 47-year old trucker was later arrested on suspicion of murder after his vehicle was pulled over by police at a side street near a council tip three miles from the death scene - but he was subsequently released without charge.

Police then arrested another lorry driver, aged 40, on suspicion of causing death by careless driving. Officers believe the dead woman was local to the area and had black hair.

She was wearing gold bangles on each wrist, had a pierced nose, a toe ring and was wearing saffron-coloured Asian clothing.

Supt Chaudhry added: ‘This continues to be a fast moving investigation. At the moment, we are treating this as a fatal road traffic collision.

‘We have currently not had reports of any missing people in the area, and we would urge anyone who has concerns to call us as soon as possible.

‘We have therefore released this description in an effort to try and identify the woman who has lost her life in what are clearly tragic circumstances.’
