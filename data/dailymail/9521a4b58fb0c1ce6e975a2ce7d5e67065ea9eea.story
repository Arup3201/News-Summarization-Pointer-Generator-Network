A schoolboy has been charged with the rape and attempted murder of a 14-year-old girl who was left for dead in a park.

The girl was found alone in Luton, Bedfordshire, with severe head injuries by a member of the public who called the emergency services.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said today that it has charged a 15-year-old Luton boy with rape and attempted murder.
