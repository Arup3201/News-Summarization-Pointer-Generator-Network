An off-duty paramedic saved a woman's life after she collapsed while working out on a treadmill at her local gym.

Mary Harris, 54, almost died after her heart stopped while exercising at the Inta Fitness Gym in Easington, Co Durham when Mark Syson rushed to her aid.

Mrs Harris was described as the luckiest woman alive' after Mr Syson's rapid intervention saved her life.

Mrs Harris, who is a civil servant said: ‘I can’t describe in words what his actions have meant for me and my family.

‘He has saved my life. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be here.’

Mr Syson was working out at the same time when he spotted Mrs Harris crumpled over the machine.

He raced over to the machine which was still running and immediately set to work.

Mr Syson, who is a paramedic with the North East Ambulance Service, called for the receptionist to phone an ambulance. He then began life-saving CPR.

Eventually Mrs Harris regained consciousness following the incident in March. She later underwent an operation to replace her aortic valve at the Sunderland Royal Hospital.

Her husband, Richard, 56, praised Mr Syson's quick actions.

'He, (Mark) has been playing down his role but all the specialists have said unequivocally Mary would have died if he hadn’t been there.’

Her surgeon, who replaced the aortic valve, described Mrs Harris as 'the luckiest woman alive'.

Following the operation in March Mrs Harris has been recovering at home with her husband who is a self-employed financial advisor.

Mr Syson later met with the Harris family.

He said: 'I was nervous and slightly embarrassed when meeting Mary and her husband Richard for the first time since the incident.

‘As a paramedic we don’t normally meet our patients again or their families after they are taken to hospital. It was lovely to see both of them again and especially Mary who seemed in good spirits regardless of what had happened.

‘It makes you feel very humble and I’m so pleased I was able to help Mary when she needed it.’

Mary Harris suffered from an undiagnosed congenital heart condition and thought a pain in her chest was due to lack of fitness when she collapsed at the Inta Fitness Gym (pictured)

Mrs Harris admitted that her family has been blighted by sudden deaths with her father, uncle and grandfather dying aged 49, 55 and 52.

Mr Harris said he would be a widow today if it was not for Mr Syson's rapid intervention.

He said: ‘There wasn’t a dry eye in the house. Mary was overjoyed to meet up with Mark.

‘He felt strange meeting someone he has “worked on” because usually the patient goes into the hospital and that is that, however, I said to him you must feel good knowing you’ve saved a life and meeting that person again.

‘At this incident there was no resuscitator available, as there would be if he was attending an incident when on duty, it was just his prompt action and effective CPR that revived Mary.

‘The consultant confirmed and my family feel that Mary would have gone the same way as her father, uncle and granddad had Mark not been there on that day at that time.

‘She’s recovering well and very grateful to still be alive.’

Surgeons at the Sunderland Royal Hospital said that without Mr Syson's (right) rapid intervention, Mrs Harris (centre) would have died leaving her husband Richard (left) a widower

Following the incident, Mrs Harris was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart condition which has been corrected as a result of the surgery meaning she should not suffer any related problems in future.

She added: '‘I feel incredibly lucky. Only three per cent of people who suffer from cardiac arrest outside of hospital survive.

‘I had felt twinges in my heart, but I just thought I was out of shape as I hadn’t been going to the gym for a while, so I pushed through the pain.

‘That was a big mistake. I am just so grateful to be alive. Not only does this mean the world to me, but also my family, my husband and my daughter.’
