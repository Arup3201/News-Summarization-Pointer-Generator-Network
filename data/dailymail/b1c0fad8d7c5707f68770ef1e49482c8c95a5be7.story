Ricciardo has enjoyed a sensational first season at Red Bull but the Australian will take a back seat at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as the focus will be on the title showdown between Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg

With double points on offer Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by 17 points, can clinch his second F1 title if he finishes second to Rosberg at the Yas Marina circuit on Sunday. If Rosberg wins, with Hamilton third or lower, Rosberg earns his first title.
