A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou has apologized for using 'ignorant and offensive' remarks to introduce the brand's fall 2015 menswear show in Paris this week, after Timberland  terminated its relationship with the brand.

During the fashion show, Mr Touitou held up a sign that read, 'Last Ni##@$ IN PARIS,' and explained that A.P.C's collaboration with Timberland is 'a very strong ghetto signifier.'

Timberland chose to 'immediately terminate' its involvement with A.P.C., including the footwear collaboration it had planned for this fall. Now, Mr Touitou has said he is 'deeply regretful' for his remarks.

Timberland has terminated its relationship with A.P.C. after founder Jean Touitou (pictured) used 'offensive remarks' to introduce the brand's fall 2015 menswear show in Paris this week

'When describing our brand's latest collaboration, I spoke recklessly using terms that were both ignorant and offensive,' he said in a statement sent to MailOnline.

'I apologize and am deeply regretful for my poor choice of words, which are in no way a reflection of my personal views.'

Timberland's president, Stewart Whitney, told Racked that after the company became aware of the 'offensive remarks' made by Mr Touitou, he chose to 'immediately terminate' Timberland's involvement with the A.P.C. brand, including the footwear collaboration we had planned for this fall.

'Simply stated, this kind of language and approach is in complete contrast with our values. Timberland seeks to collaborate with designers and brands who are at the forefront of lifestyle trends; equally important, they must also share our values. 

'We will not tolerate offensive language or racial slurs of any kind being associated with the Timberland brand.'

According to A.P.C., Mr Touitou didn't mean to offend.

In an earlier statement sent to BuzzFeed, the brand stated that Mr Touitou was simply making a reference to two moments in recent popular culture.

While holding up a sign that read, 'Last Ni##@$ IN PARIS,' Mr Touitou explained that A.P.C's collaboration with Timberland is 'a very strong ghetto signifier'

Yesterday Timberland chose to 'immediately terminate' its involvement A.P.C., including the footwear collaboration it had planned for this fall

'One being the song Niggas in Paris by Kanye West and Jay Z and the second being the Bernardo Bertolucci film Last Tango in Paris. The connection was used to describe a look for the collection and was in no way intended to cause offense.'

Style.com printed Mr Touitou's original remarks, revealing that he called the collection 'Last N****s in Paris' because 'it's the sweet spot when the hood—the 'hood—meets Bertolucci's movie Last Tango in Paris. So that's 'N****s in Paris' and Last N****s in Paris.

'I mean, it's nice to play with the strong signifiers. The Timberland here is a very strong ghetto signifier. In the ghetto, it is all the Timberlands, all the big chain. Not at the same time—never; it's bad taste. 

'So we designed Timberlands with Timberland.'

Later, Style.com asked Mr Touitou to clarify what he meant.

He explained via Email: 'I made looks which are a cross-over of those two references: the Timberland shoes and the sweat pants are iconic of hip-hop, and the camel hair color coat, worn with nothing under it, is iconic of that precise movie. 

'I am friends with Kanye [West, who recorded Ni**as in Paris with Jay Z], and he and I presented a joint collection at the same place, one year ago, and that this thing is only a homage to our friendship.'
