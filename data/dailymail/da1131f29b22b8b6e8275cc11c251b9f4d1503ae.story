Giants cornerback Prince Amukamara has revealed that he's a virgin and has never had a drop of alcohol.

The 24-year-old devout Catholic, who hails from Nigeria, said his clean lifestyle has led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player.

'I am a virgin,' he said in an interview with Muscle & Fitness. 'I'm not ashamed to say that.'

He added that his faith has also been the driving force behind his decision not to drink.

Proud: New York Giants' cornerback Prince Amukamara has revealed he is a virgin and has never had alcohol

'I grew up Catholic, so it just started 
out as one of those things,' Amukamara told the magazine. 'I'd think, 
"If I do this, maybe I can get to heaven," so I said no drinks, no sex, 
all the big things.

'As I grew up, I realized that’s not 
what it's about. It's about having a relationship with Jesus. It's not 
about "Don't do this. Don't do that." But still, it’s just one of those 
things I haven't done, and I don't see any benefit to doing it.'

Although he doesn't drink with his friends, he still loves going clubbing and gets 'high off of everyone else's high', he said.

It was in a club in New York City where he met his now-fiance Pilar Davis, whom he proposed to on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19.

He told her that he might have an alcoholic drink at his bachelor party - but he's not sure yet.

They met at a Manhattan nightclub two years ago where he was 'drawn to her' and even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say.

He explained: 'Later, I was waiting for Ahmad [Bradshaw] and she came by and we struck up a conversation.

'I
 asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your 
number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it. But 
if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.'

But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her.

He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut.

He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him.

'So two 
days later, I said "Hey, I play for the Giants",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San
 Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.'

They are planning to marry the week after the Super Bowl.

For now, the star player said he sees his home in the U.S., even though his father is a chief in a village in Nigeria - meaning that he is, quite literally, a prince.

He told the magazine that if he wanted to become a chief of the village, he would have to just move there - but he has no plans to do so.
