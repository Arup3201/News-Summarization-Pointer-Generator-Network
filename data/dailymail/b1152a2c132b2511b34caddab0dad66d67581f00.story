He only touched down on Sunday but Manny Pacquiao wasted no time in starting his training on American soil with a run through the streets of Los Angeles.

The 36-year-old will meet Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 and he is in LA to complete the second part of his training camp at trainer Freddie Roach's Wild Card Gym.

Pacquiao posted a video of his run on his Instagram account on Monday as he looks to reach peak fitness for the mega-fight at the MGM Grand.

And on Tuesday he followed it up with a clip of his bag work, showcasing the speed and power he hopes will end Mayweather's unbeaten record in a little under two months.

Alongside the video, Pacquaio wrote: 'First day of training here in wild card gym, feels good to be back. Thank you Lord for the strength that you have given me day by day.'

Pacquiao, who will come face-to-face with Mayweather at their first and only press conference on March 11, has refused to comment on his impressions of the American outside of the ring.

Speaking to Yahoo Sports, he said: 'I don't want to talk about that.

'I don't have anything to say about him right now. I'm not talking about him.'

The Filipino was more open about Mayweather's boxing style, praising the 38-year-old's ability while maintaining an air of confidence in his own.

'He has very good speed and footwork, and he has punches, and that makes him look good,' Pacquiao said. 

'But it depends on the fighter he is going to fight. For me as a boxer, I know what the job is. I'm going to throw a lot of punches, a lot of hard punches.

Mayweather began training in his Las Vegas gym exactly two months before fighting Pacquiao

Mayweather and Pacquiao finally agreed terms last month for one the most eagerly anticipated fights ever

Mayweather, still undefeated at 38, is training in Las Vegas, where the fight will take place on May 2

'There is nobody out there who really has thrown a lot of punches at him, but I'm going to do that. He is a very good boxer, but I know how to box and I can move side to side and throw punches.'

Mayweather, meanwhile, has also started his training for the fight which promoter Bob Arum believes could earn the boxers an eye-watering $300million (£200m).

The American took to social media website shots.com to share images of his training regime at his gym in Las Vegas, which included a sparring session and lifting weights.
