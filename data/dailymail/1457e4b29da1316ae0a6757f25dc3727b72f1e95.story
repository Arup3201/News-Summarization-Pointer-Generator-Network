A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five.

During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.'

Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized.

Sorry: Fox News host Eric Bolling (left) has apologized after making sexist comments on his program The Five earlier this week that upset many, including cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle (right)

Tacky: Boling and panelis Greg Gutfeld made sexist comments about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri (above), a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria

'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today.

'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.'

This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon.

'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 

'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.'

Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force.

'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued.

'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them. 

Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes.

Outraged: Guilfoyle asked the men why they were 'ruining her thing' as she tried to celebrate the fighter pilot and her accomplishments

Embarrassing: Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren took the men (seen above with their fellow panelists on The Five) to task over their comments on her eponymous show later that day

'Problem is, after she bombed it she couldn't park it,' said Greg Gutfeld.

That's when Bolling added, 'Would that be considered boobs on the ground, or no?'

At this point Guilfoyle became visibly upset with the men, and asked them why they were 'ruining her thing.' 

Later that day, Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren took the boys to task on her eponymous show.

'Do you think the gents on "The Five," minus Bob, should get a do-over on that one? They're going to get in so much trouble for that one,' she said. 

Gutfeld still has yet to apologize for his statement.

Sadly, it seems that Maj. Mansouri is used to these comments, telling CNN in an interview earlier this summer, 'Whenever a woman enters a new male-dominated field, they find the same hesitation, the same prejudice, the same stereotype thinking.
