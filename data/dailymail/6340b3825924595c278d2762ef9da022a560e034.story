Are you called Katie, Sophie or Louise? Congratulations, you make the best wife.

Men, are you named David, Andrew or Daniel? You're in luck because you make the best husband, according to a new survey.

A light-hearted piece of research looked at the virtues associated with common first names based on their experiences with their own partners as well as those of friends, relatives and colleagues.

Marriage material: Women named Katie (left, Katie Price) and men named David (right, David Beckham), make the best wife or husband, reveals a new study

Other names of wives who were most likely to be kind, caring, and good partners overall were Sarah and Emily.

Women named Charlotte and Elizabeth were seen as particularly desirable and made the top list of wives men appreciate most.

Amy and Jessica also featured highly, while Lucy rounded off the top ten.

John rounded off the top five husbands women said make the best husband material.

Other names girls should keep an eye out for were William, Simon and James - all proving good catches, with Chris and Stephen completing the top 10 names of the best husbands.

Girls
 called Emma and Gemma just missed out on the list of favourable names 
for men's better halves, as did Ellie, Nicole and Grace.

Wonderful wife: Women named Sophie (left, Sophie Ellis Bexter) and Louise (right, Louise Redknapp), apparently make the best wives

Eligible: Women, looking for a husband? Go for a Daniel (like Mr Craig) or an Andrew (Freddie Flintoff's birth name)

Men called Mark, Rob and Pete also narrowly missed out on the list of the top 10 most reliable husband names

A spokesman for Siteopia, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Every time we hear mention of a name we naturally associate particular values or impressions based on our past experiences.

'It seems certain names tend to crop up more than others when thinking about the qualities of a good husband or wife and the lists no doubt make interesting reading to many.

'Of course, people shouldn't be judged on a name alone, so while men like David and Andrew seem to be top of the pile, they've still got to uphold that reputation day to day.

Great name! Sarah Jessica Parker and Paul Hollywood make great spouses if the survey results are anything to go by

'Whether it's through celebrities or 
people we already know, there's a lot of power in a name and they are 
something everyone has an opinion on.

'In both a personal and business context, whenever we first hear a name we immediately attribute certain qualities.

'If
 starting a business or website the same consideration should always go 
toward choosing the name and could be the difference between success and
 failure.'
