A 37-year-old man mysteriously collapsed and died after opening a container which bore the description ‘Pandora’s Box’ in red letters, an inquest has heard.

Jason Airey was found unconscious by his parents next to the box, which contained unused synthetic cannabis, in the bedroom of their home in Carlisle, Cumbria - and no drugs were found in his system.

Mr Airey’s heart had stopped beating, causing his organs to fail - and he died two days later at Cumberland Infirmary, having never regained consciousness following his collapse in May.

Location: Jason Airey, 37, was found unconscious by his parents next to the box, which contained unused synthetic cannabis, in the bedroom of their home on this road in Carlisle, Cumbria

In Greek mythology, Zeus gave the box to Pandora with instructions that she should not open it - but she eventually gave in to her curiosity, and all the miseries and evils flew out to afflict mankind.

Mr Airey had worked for food manufacturing business Cavaghan and Gray and construction firm Metal Box, both in Carlisle. His father Dennis told the inquest his son had been happy on May 2.

According to the Carlisle News & Star, Mr Airey Snr said: ‘He was just his normal self. I think he had enjoyed himself in town. He had been shopping and said he was going upstairs to get changed.’

Mr Airey Snr said his wife Anne became worried when their son had been upstairs for a while. ‘She went upstairs and came back down saying something was wrong,’ he added. ‘She couldn’t wake him.’

Ruling: Coroner Robert Chapman said Mr Airey's heart stopping 'caused the death of his brain which caused multiple organ failure'

Paramedics were called and Mr Airey Snr started CPR, he said. The paramedics worked on his son for an hour before he was taken to hospital, the newspaper reported.

'We don’t really know what caused his heart to stop'

His father said he found ‘a little packet’ inside the box and had originally thought it was cannabis - but ‘it didn’t smell’. The court heard that tests later revealed it was synthetic cannabis.

Mr Airey Snr added: ‘It was a packet but had not been used. It was on the bed right beside him. He hadn’t taken any drugs after having a bad experience with ecstasy 13 years ago.’

Ruling a natural death, Coroner Robert Chapman said: ‘His heart stopping caused the death of his brain which caused multiple organ failure. We don’t really know what caused his heart to stop.’

Epimetheus and Prometheus were brothers who lived in Ancient Greece. The gods were upset because the duo had given fire to humans - and they now wanted to punish the siblings.

Zeus created Pandora and took her to Prometheus, but he refused her because he knew the gods wanted revenge. However Epimetheus thought she was beautiful and agreed to marry her.

The couple lived without worry until she received a box from Zeus, who said it must not be opened.

Pandora, however, let curiosity get the better of her and opened the box. It contained the evils of disease, misery and death - which poured out of the box, shaped as tiny moths which stung her.

She then shut the box again, and Prometheus ran to see her. They could hear a voice calling to be let out - and opened the lid once more. Out came hope, which healed her wounds.

So, Pandora had released pain and suffering on the world - but had also allowed hope to follow.
