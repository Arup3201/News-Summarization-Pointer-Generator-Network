Luke Shaw could be facing three weeks out with ankle ligament damage.

The England international went over on his left ankle early on in Saturday's victory over Arsenal and was forced off after 16 minutes.

He left the Emirates on crutches wearing a protective boot. The subsequent swelling and bruising has delayed the 19-year-old's scan which will give a clearer picture of how serious the injury is. However, initial concerns are that he is facing a couple of weeks at least on the sidelines.

Despite Shaw's injury, United defender Reece James is poised to join Rotherham United on loan.

The 21-year-old impressed at left back during the club's summer tour of USA but Louis van Gaal is prepared to allow James out to gain more experience.

James is expected to be joined at the New York Stadium by former United team-mate Tom Lawrence who has failed to make an impression at Leicester City since his summer transfer.

Rotherham, who are third from bottom in the Championship, have allowed full back Richard Brindley to join Scunthorpe on loan until January.

Meanwhile, United defender Marcos Rojo was back at Carrington on Tuesday to begin his recovery from a dislocated shoulder. The Argentine did gym work trying to loosen and strengthen muscles around the shoulder joint.

Jonny Evans and Ander Herrera played for United's reserves against Blackburn in the Lancashire Senior Cup on Tuesday night.

Midfielder Michael Carrick has started studying for his UEFA B Licence coaching badge.
