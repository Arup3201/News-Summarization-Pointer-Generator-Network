Former world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene has said it is 'disappointing' all Commonwealth Games medallists will not automatically be drug-tested, and insisted his fellow Welshmen Gareth Warburton and Rhys Williams are not 'deliberate cheaters'.

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has adopted a 'quality over quantity' approach to anti-doping measures in Glasgow, with specific sports being targeted instead of asking all medallists to provide urine or blood samples.

'I am surprised by that,' said Greene. 'You can't test enough, really. For everyone to be tested is the way forward, in my mind, and our sport will become cleaner because of more testing I think. So that's disappointing.'

Not good enough: Dai Green couldn't make it through in his Commonwealth 400m hurdles heat

Trailing: Greene was disappointed but said he already knew he may not have been good enough

Banned: Gareth Warburton, Greene's former housemate, was not able to take his place in Glasgow

Dragon: Fellow Welshman Rhys Williams, who Greene admits not seeing eye-to-eye to, is also banned

Greene's former housemate Warburton, 32, and Williams, 30, were both suspended from the Wales team after testing positive for banned substances before the Games began.

The exact nature of the drugs involved have not been disclosed, but the pair use the same range of supplements, Mountain Fuel, which are not listed on the Informed-Sport website, either in the list of registered or batch-tested products.

Athletes are urged to cross-check this website for accredited supplements that should be safe and legal for them to use, although the resource still does not offer a 100 per cent guarantee.

Greene said: 'When Gaz found out he texted me and I was really quite upset about it because I know Gaz and lived with him for a few years. He’s not that kind of guy.

'He lived off raisins and cous cous because he couldn't afford anything else, so I don't think he's organising a drugs ring.

'Hopefully they can get to the bottom of things and find things out because I do believe that they are not deliberate cheaters. They have probably just been careless or misled slightly. That will come out eventually I’m sure.

'Even though me and Rhys don’t really get on, I know he’s not the sort of person to deliberately cheat. I don’t think anybody in the Welsh or British team honestly believes they have gone out of their way to cheat. I’ve not known anyone who has been in their situation before so it was a big shock for me.

'It’s just unfortunate but as professional athletes we’ve got to learnt not to take anything that isn’t batch tested. Hopefully other people will learn from it.'

Lagging: Greene fell away after a decent start to his Commonwealth title defence

Warburton and Williams, who both deny 'knowingly taking any banned substances' have been suspended from all competition pending the outcome of their appeals, which will not take place until September at the earliest.

Greene said he expected any ban to extend into next season, but advised his Wales team-mates had already been punished enough by missing the Commonwealth Games and next month's European Championships.

The 28-year-old added: 'There’s bound to be a punishment because you can’t get away with having steroids or whatever else in your system. But, hopefully they will look at the situation.

Strange behaviour: One of the reason's Greene says Warburton can't be a drugs cheat was his diet - the 800m runner apparently lived off a diet of raisins and cous cous

'They’ve already been punished quite severely in terms of missing the Commonwealths – they will be too old at the next one to be in any shape so that’s a massive knock.

'They had ambitions to be at the Europeans as well so that’s two championships they are going to miss. The ban they will probably get will go into next season as well so they will get punished for it.

'They haven’t deliberately taken anything but they will be punished for it. I can’t imagine being in that situation. Hopefully they can come back from this as stronger athletes and continue their careers because they are past 30 now. I do feel sorry for them in that regard.'
