A couple of intrigued snails appear completely transfixed by a gaping hole as they each balance on the edge of a flower in these incredible split-second pictures.

But the cavity is actually the aftermath of a falling water droplet. Unable to take their eyes off the splashes, the curious snails watched intently and didn't move for five minutes.

The scene was photographed by Alberto Ghizzi Panizza. He watched the molluscs edge closer and closer to the pond in the wetlands on the banks of the Po River near Parma, Italy.

Staring into the abyss: A couple of intrigued snails are completely transfixed by falling water droplets, which created this split-second vortex in the water

The photographer said the snails were utterly transfixed by the splashes, watching them for five minutes

Mr Panizza, a technician and professional photographer, was taking pictures by the pond and watched as the snails took an interest in the falling water drops.

The 39-year-old from Parma, Italy, said: 'I started taking the pictures to create a set of the pond, with these two flowers just above the water.'I found some snails on the flowers and they started to move around as they were attracted by the drops.

'At first I thought they were looking at their reflection but it was the splashes that attracted them.

'It was funny to watch the snails but I really didn't know how they felt. I guess they were really curious.

'To make sure they didn't fall in, I helped the snails off the flowers and placed them on the bank when their interest in the splashes diminished.

'I wasn't sure if they could swim and I wanted to help them.'
