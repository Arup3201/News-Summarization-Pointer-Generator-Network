Islamic State fighters have been showing off their embarrassingly poor culinary skills on social media. 

Old British favourite fish and chips appears to be the most popular dish badly cooked by homesick jihadis in Syria and Iraq.

Much of their terrible attempts at catering appears to be done with childish simplicity and little consideration for a balance diet.

Soggy looking chips always seem to feature in photos, accompanied usually with an over-cooked piece of tough meat or an under-grilled fish.

Salad rarely features on the dinner plates of most ISIS fighters, usually left behind as ornamental decoration.

Tasteless flat bread always seems to be another popular side dish. Easy to source from the locals, the dry bread looks distinctly unappetizing.

On rare occasions better quality meat like crab is proudly shown off on social media by the members of the extremist group. 

Crab is considered haram (forbidden) according to some schools of thought in Islam.

Even McDonalds fast food have been smuggled across from Turkey to accommodate for ISIS fighters' love of the hugely popular American  chain.

A delighted fighter, known only as Ghareeb, posted a picture of a McDonalds bag on his social media page. 

According to the fighter, one of his friends allegedly managed to bring in a bag full of five cheese burgers when they traveled into Syria.

Starved of any variety in his diet, the fighter tweeted it was first time in two years since he last ate one of McDonald's famous cheeseburger.

Flapjacks, crisps and packets of cocoa powder all appear to be rare novelties for many ISIS fighters in Syria and Iraq.

Stolen rations have also been displayed on social media, with fighters taking great pleasure in sampling some of the finer foods given to Kurdish and other rebel fighter groups.

Most of their meals seem to be washed down with an assortment of teeth-rotting sweet fizzy drinks.

One fighter posted a photo of a whole fridge, packed to the roof with a range of cans and bottle of pop.

An attempt at making a cappuccino is shown off by one fighter on social media. Many jihadis seem to live off a poor diet of junk food and fizzy drinks.  

Ice cream and chocolate bars appear to be stuffed into the side draws of the fridge, in an attempt to keep them away from the Sun's fierce heat in Iraq. 

Likewise dessert shops are shown off by ISIS in an attempt to try and normalise life under their brutal regime in Syria and Iraq. 

Poorly baked profiteroles are shown disguised with a thick layer of cheap chocolate, much to the delight of the starving fighters.
