A Montana couple has been charged after allegedly letting a 2-year-old boy smoke marijuana.

Lucas Keith Wilson and Camilla Rose Samuels have been charged with felony and misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

Wilson was brought to the Gallatin County Detention Center on Friday and is being held on a $50,000 bond, but Samuels is still at large.

Charged: Lucas Wilson (left) and Camilla Rose (right), seen after the birth of their younger child in July, have been charged with endangering Wilson's 2-year-old son by letting him smoke marijuana

Dangerous: Wilson, who reported to jail on Friday, told investigators that when they were in the hospital after Samuels gave birth to this newborn, they would sneak out of the room and smoke marijuana outside

Court records say the investigation began in August when Samuels' mother told investigators she found a video on her daughter's phone showing Wilson's son putting a pipe in his mouth.

Prosecutors say both Wilson and Samuels told investigators they let the boy smoke marijuana five times since August.

Wilson said it would make the boy mellow.

Adding to the endangerment of the 2-year-old, Samuels gave birth to their child in July and court documents state that the baby tested positive for marijuana and meth.

The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports 
that the couple were living in a trailer on West Main Street in Bozeman 
in 2012 when they discovered that she was pregnant.

In
 January of 2013, when she was in her second trimester of ther 
pregnancy, they began to drink and smoke both meth and marijuana.

Infuriating: After their baby was born with traces of meth and marijuana in its system, that didn't stop their drug use and Samuels wrote to a friend that she wanted them to visit the hospital so she could go out and smoke

They did not keep their drug use a secret and were said to regularly smoke in front of the 2-year-old.

They moved to Washington state briefly and decided to move back to Montana with the intention of selling meth and marijuana.

Their dealing plan didn't work out, however, because they personally consumed all of the drugs before they got back to Montana.

As part of a deal that they struck with the 2-year-old, they agreed that he would be allowed to smoke marijuana five times.

When
 they returned to the state, they lived at Sunrise Campground and that 
is when the boy was videotaped smoking from the pipe.

Failed plan: Samuels and Wilson began smoking marijuana and meth when they temporarily moved to Washington state when she was in her second trimester. They planed to sell the drugs but ended up smoking them all

In July of last year, Samuels gave birth to their son Malachi Dean Wilson at a Bozeman hospital.

She posted a number of photos of the newborn on her Facebook account and even though she wrote to that the baby was 'clean and healthy as can be,' blood tests proved otherwise.

Her hospital stay didn't seem to stop her drug habit either: when a friend offers to bring her a soda during an upcoming visit, she responded by writing 'Hey i might go smk then lol [sic]'.

Wilson confirmed their drug use to investigators, and he told police that the couple would sneak out of her hospital room and smoke outside the building.
