The owners of two dogs that mauled a six-year-old girl, biting off part of her ear have walked free from court.

Ellie May Hall was savaged by the pair of snarling American Pit Bull terriers after they pounced as she played on her scooter.

One of the beasts started biting her head and neck while the other sank its teeth into her torso and legs.

The schoolgirl suffered multiple injuries and part of her ear was bitten off, which medics were unable to reattach.

Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and daughter Stacey Mielnik, 20, were given a suspended three month prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court

She was also left with a hole in her arm and bite marks to her thighs, and needed a two-and-a-half hour operation, skin grafts and 11 stitches in her head.

Mother and daughter, Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and Stacey Mielnik, 20,admitted being the owners of dogs which caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place at Newcastle Crown Court. 

 Ellie was playing in her back yard around 3pm on May 4, when the two American Pit Bulls appeared, behind Katherine Street, Ashington, Northumberland.

The girl believed the dogs were friendly when they came up to the yard and started sniffing, after smelling the scent of Ellie's dog.

The previously placid dogs, then suddenly started to savage the youngster. 

Jason Charlton was working on his motorbike nearby and was alerted by the child's screams.

 'He thought it was a dog fight then he heard a child screaming and crying,' said Prosecutor Emma Dowling.

'He opened his back gate and could see a small child on her knees facing into the rear gate. 

'She had her hands on her head to protect herself and both dogs were attacking her, one towards the neck and head and the other on her torso.

'He had a crowbar in his hand and chased the dogs away but he said the dogs returned.'

Ellie May Hall, pictured in hospital after attack with her mother Tina, has suffered 'significant psychological effects'

Mr Charlton, helped by two other men, said he was worried for his own safety because both dogs appeared extremely vicious.

In a statement to the court, he said: 'It was a horrific and terrifying incident. I'm positive if I did not come out when I did the dogs would have continued to attack Ellie.

'It was clear she had sustained substantial injuries.'

The court heard both dogs were at the home of Mitchell when Mielnik arrived at the house, coming in through the back gate.

Miss Dowling said: 'That gate does have bolts but they are not used by the family routinely.

'On this day they must have been left closed but not bolted or not closed properly because both dogs escaped from the rear yard into the rear lane.'

The attack continues to cause Ellie and her parents ongoing problems physically and mentally.

Miss Dowling said: 'She has suffered significant psychological effects and struggles to sleep.

'She is now extremely frightened of dogs and her family have had to get rid of their own dog because Ellie was petrified at what might happen.

'She struggles to visit her grandparents because they have neighbours with dogs either side so phone calls have to be made before they visit to make sure the dogs are in the house.

Recorder Anton Lodge QC said he hoped the community would not continue to 'behave unpleasantly' towards the mother and daughter

'Her parents have also been affected significantly and are worried about the effect this has had on Ellie. This has had a lasting effect on the family as a whole.' 

Mitchell, 43, formerly of Milburn Road, Ashington and Mielnik, 20, formerly of of Chestnut Street, Ashington, consented to the dogs being destroyed after the attack. 

The court heard the pair have suffered threats in their local community and have had their windows smashed and been forced to move as a result of the incident.

Mark Styles, for Mitchell, said: 'She has been a dog owner for 30 years and is devastated and truly horrified at what happened to Ellie, it has turned her life upside down.

'She is a new mother and has been subjected to harassment in the local area and has been forced to move home twice and her windows have been put out.'

Richard Bloomfield, for Mielnik, said: 'The dogs had given no prior indication of behaving in this way, it was an attack out of the blue.

'What she did wrong is to fail to take proper precautions to make sure the gate was secure, not realising the gravity of the consequences that afternoon when they got loose.

'She is distraught and deeply remorseful.

'She lives alone with her daughter and has suffered abuse from the local community.'

Recorder Anton Lodge QC sentenced both Mitchell and Mielnik to three month suspended prison sentence.

 'The community should realise the punishment for what you have done is reserved to the courts, which are publicly seen and overlooked,' said the recorder.

'I hope the community will not continue to behave in an unpleasant way towards either of you.'
