This bird looks hungry for a fish supper as he eyeballs a large rainbow trout - before greedily swallowing it whole.

The cormorant had bided its time, waiting for the fish to jump out of the water, before  pouncing.

The two animals - pictured near Long Beach, California - even appeared to look each other straight in the eye as the trout considered its fate.

This hungry bird does its own bit of fishing by waiting patiently before swooping in to catch a large rainbow trout in its yellow bill

After that brief moment the cormorant didn't waste any time, swallowing the trout in one sitting.

Photographer Andrew Lee from Irvine, California, travelled to the El Dorado Regional Park in his home state to capture the fascinating moment.

He said: 'I was following a group of cormorants who were hunting for the fish in the lake.

'As soon as I spotted a cormorant come up with fish, I was able to take one frame of this rare moment when the fish is looking directly at his nemesis.'

Dr Lee, a Pricing & Portfolio Manger, had to lie on the ground to take the photographs.

He added: 'It happened in a split second. The bird was able to grab the trout before the fish disappeared into the lake.

'I happened to catch the rare moment when the tail of the fish just touched the water - and the fish was also looking directly at the cormorant.

'I was surprised with how big the fish was and wondered if the bird would be able to swallow it - and it easily did.'

Dr Lee was thrilled with the set of pictures after travelling 23 miles to the park near Long Beach, California.

He continued: 'I was very happy when I saw the images, I knew it was a very special moment that would never happen again.

'I felt a little sad for the fish, but I took comfort in knowing that I would be able to tell a story of the fish's final moment.

'I hope that the photographs show the viewer the daily struggle of the hunter and the hunted.'
