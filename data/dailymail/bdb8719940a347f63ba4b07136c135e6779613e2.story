Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert believes Saturday's opponents Manchester United can still win the Barclays Premier League title this season despite a poor start to the campaign.

Louis van Gaal's side are clearly outsiders to lift the trophy after the Dutch coach's bedding-in period left them eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who are fighting it out with Manchester City at the top.

United have looked suspect in defence for much of the season but recent signs of improvement have convinced Lambert they should not be written off.

It was United's sixth straight Premier League win to leave them third in the table 

'They might not be able to lose many more games if they are going to win the title but they're certainly in with a shout,' said the Villa boss.

'It is still a brilliant club with great players. The players they have brought in, there are not many teams in world football who can do that. They're a really good side.'

The Red Devils have now won six matches in a row to significantly close the gap between themselves and their two rivals and now look a lot healthier than they did under David Moyes last season.

'Just because they've changed managers doesn't change my thinking of that football club,' Lambert added.

'Chelsea and City have lost less games. But if United don't win it they will certainly have a big say in who does.

'If we win tomorrow it's good for us, that's the most important thing. We have to win for ourselves, it's got nothing to do with stopping United.'

Villa will be without three players through suspension when they welcome Van Gaal's side.

On-loan Tom Cleverley, who would not have been allowed to play against his parent club anyway, is banned alongside Alan Hutton and Kieran Richardson.

Ashley Westwood (knee), Joe Cole (hamstring), Philippe Senderos (calf) and Nathan Baker (knee) are all injured, but captain Ron Vlaar and midfielder Fabian Delph are available after both returned from injury last weekend.
