Fossils of a sparrow-sized creature from China has cast doubts on the commonly held belief that birds evolved from ground-dwelling dinosaurs that slowly gained the ability to fly.

It’s long been thought theropods evolved this skill over time, but re-examination of the Scansoriopteryx fossils suggest they may have, instead, been tree-dwelling animals that learnt to glide.

Researchers want the creature to be reclassified as an early bird whose ancestors include tree-climbing archosaurs that lived in a time before dinosaurs.

The fossil of the Scansoriopteryx, which means ‘climbing wing’ was found in Inner Mongolia, and is part of an ongoing cooperative study with the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.

It was previously classified as a 
coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur, from which many experts believe flying
 dinosaurs and later birds evolved.

Researchers used advanced 3D microscopy, high resolution photography 
and low angle lighting to reveal structures not clearly visible before. 

Through their investigations, the researchers found a combination of non-dinosaurian traits along with highly derived features.

These include birdlike forelimbs and wing feathers alongside claws that would have made tree climbing possible, and tail vertebrae similar to a Velociraptor.

It was previously classified as a coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur, from which many experts believe flying dinosaurs, and later birds, evolved.

But new analysis, carried out by Stephen Czerkas of the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, and Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina, suggests otherwise.

The research duo used advanced 3D microscopy, high resolution photography and low angle lighting to reveal structures not clearly visible before.

These techniques made it possible to interpret the natural contours of the bones.

Through their investigations, the researchers found a combination of non-dinosaurian traits along with highly derived features.

For example, it had birdlike features such as elongated forelimbs, wing and hind limb feathers, wing membranes in front of its elbow, half-moon shaped wrist-like bones, bird-like perching feet, a tail with short anterior vertebrae.

This reclassification would put Scansoriopteryx in a similar ancestry to the bird-line archosaur Scleromochlus, (artist's illustration pictured)

The researchers specifically note the primitive elongated feathers on the forelimbs and hind limbs.

However, it was also found to have elongated tendons along its tail vertebrae similar to a Velociraptor, and claws that would have made climbing trees possible.

This suggests Scansoriopteryx is an ancestral form of early birds that mastered the basic manoeuvres of parachuting or gliding from trees.

The team's findings validate predictions first made in the early 1900's that the ancestors of birds were small, tree-dwelling archosaurs which enhanced their ability to fly with feathers that enabled them to at least glide.

This ‘trees down’ view is in contrast with the ‘ground up’ view embraced by many palaeontologists in recent decades that birds derived from terrestrial theropod dinosaurs.

‘The identification of Scansoriopteryx as a non-dinosaurian bird enables a reevaluation in the understanding of the relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Scientists finally have the key to unlock the doors that separate dinosaurs from birds,’ explained Czerkas.

Feduccia added, ‘Instead of regarding birds as deriving from dinosaurs, Scansoriopteryx reinstates the validity of regarding them as a separate class uniquely avian and non-dinosaurian.’

The ancestral archosaurs are thought to have originated 250 million years ago, in the late Permian Period.

Their descendants, including the dinosaurs, were terrestrial vertebrates for a majority of the Mesozoic Era.

The study appears in Springer's Journal of Ornithology.

The Scansoriopteryx, or 'climbing wing', fossil was found in Inner Mongolia

@highlight

3D microscopy revealed it lacked features to classify it as a dinosaur

@highlight

It had birdlike features including elongated forelimbs and wing feathers

@highlight

But, it also had claws that would have made tree climbing possible

@highlight

Birds were typically thought to have derived from theropod dinosaurs

@highlight

Instead, Scansoriopteryx should be 
seen as an early bird whose ancestors are among tree-climbing archosaurs
 that lived in a time before dinosaurs
