One is the fastest man in history with a personal fortune of more than £30million.

The other is an accounts worker from Dartford who trains part-time at an athletics club.

But that didn't stop Usain Bolt falling for sexy 22-year-old Megan Edwards in a romance that is said to have inspired his triple gold-winning performance at London 2012, it was reported in the Sun on Sunday.

Influence: It has been reported that Megan went on a series of dates with Bolt as the 26-year-old powered his way to victories in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay

Bolt, who holds the 100m world record with a time of 9.58 seconds, swapped numbers with Megan when they appeared on the catwalk together to unveil Jamaica's team kit earlier this year.

It is believed they went on a series of secret dates during the Games as 26-year-old Bolt powered his way to victories in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.

Megan, a junior athlete at Dartford Harriers Athletics Club, then celebrated his unprecedented success at a party in London's Brick Lane, where Bolt whipped the crowds into a frenzy with his DJ-ing skills.

A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'It was crazy. Everyone was trying to get a piece of him - especially the girls. But Usain only had eyes for one girl that night and that was Megan. She was by his side all night.'

Smitten: Megan, an accounts manager from Dartford, is said to have swapped numbers with Bolt during the photoshoot and joined him in London to celebrate his triple gold-winning performance at the Games

They later went to West End club Movida along with Bolt's teammate Yohan Blake, boxer Lennox Lewis and hip-hop artist Nas.

A friend of Megan said: 'Megan was in her element. She's really smitten with Usain. It's nothing too serious at the moment as he's jetting off all over the world - but they are two adults having fun.'

Bolt had ordered a £50,000 bottle of champagne, which apparently featured in a picture of the pair uploaded on Megan's Facebook page.

Inspired: Bolt surges to gold in the 100m. It is said he dated Megan several times during the Games

On another picture she is said to have commented: 'Me n my Baby!! The Bolt!! X'.

Bolt, who earns around £13million a year in sponsorship deals and appearance fees, met Megan around three months ago at the photoshoot.

His agent told MailOnline: 'We do not make any comments on the privates lives of our athletes.'

Megan told The Sun she was not prepared to talk about 'us two'.
