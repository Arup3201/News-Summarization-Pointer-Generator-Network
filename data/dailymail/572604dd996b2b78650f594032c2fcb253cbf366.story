Olivia Glennie, 15, was found hanging by a man walking his dog in a wooded area last Tuesday

The mother of a 15-year-old girl who died in hospital five days after being found hanging in woodland has spoken of how her family are at a loss to explain her death.

Olivia Glennie was found by a man walking his dog in a wooded area last Tuesday.

The year 11 pupil from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was taken to hospital and treated in intensive care but died in Leeds General Infirmary on Monday morning.

Speaking from the family home, the teenager's mother Diane described her as 'popular and outgoing'.

She said: 'Olivia had lots of friends and was from a very close family.

'We have no clue why this happened. No idea at all. I just want to say that without everyone's support I don't think we would have been able to carry on.

'We have a very close knit family and we are all pulling together. Olivia had so many friends and they have been absolutely brilliant.

'It is a very difficult time but the support we have had from them and from others at Olivia's school is overwhelming.

'It means so much to us and I'd like to say thank you for that.'

Her death has shocked staff and students at Newsome High School and Sports College.

Headteacher Paul Gittins said Olivia had a close circle of friends and was popular with school staff.

In a statement, he said: 'The whole school community is deeply saddened by these tragic events.

'Olivia was a popular and outgoing girl with a close circle of friends and popular with staff.

'We are doing everything we can to provide support to all those who need it. The school is being fully supported by the local authority.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Olivia, her family and her many friends at this distressing time.'

West Yorkshire Police said Olivia's death was not being treated as suspicious. A spokesman for the force said police and an ambulance crew were called just after 7pm last Tuesday.

Olivia was initially taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary but later that evening was transferred to the intensive care unit at Leeds General Infirmary.

'It is a very difficult time but the support we have had from them and from others at Olivia's school is overwhelming'Â
