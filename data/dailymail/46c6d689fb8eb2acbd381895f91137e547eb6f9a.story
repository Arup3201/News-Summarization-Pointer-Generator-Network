One of Britain's busiest shopping centres was the scene of a gypsy-style bare knuckle fight captured on camera as shoppers looked on.

The pair began, what appears to be an illegally planned boxing bout in Manchester's Trafford Centre, while a friend filmed it on a mobile phone.

YouTube footage, which has gone viral after being filmed in April, shows shocked cinema-goers jumping for cover as the fight spilled towards them.

The fight takes place in the Trafford Centre, a busy shopping centre in Manchester, in front of horrified shoppers and cinema goers

A voice on the film is heard shouting 'Sing Danny Boy - Hit him' as the fight reaches its peak.

Four uniformed security staff eventually break up the fight, and one of the pair is seen bleeding from a head wound.

The footage was uploaded under the title Official Bareknuckles, and has been viewed 52,000 times.

One viewer posted: 'People see moronic s**t like this in England and then the English get a bad reputation. Thanks a lot you inbred cretins.'

Fighting like this is is typical of a gypsy-style straightener, arranged to settle petty disputes.

And this is not the first time that a fight of this kind has been filmed in Manchester.

In 2011 Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty, 52, had his ear bitten off in a bare-knuckle street brawl outside a PC World store.

The fight was uploaded to YouTube and showed the star, who found fame on Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, grappling with his cousin Johnny Joyce, 21.

Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they were called about this Trafford Centre incident on April 21.

Two men were arrested on suspicion of affray.  One of the men has since been given a £110 fine and the other was given a six-month referral order. Both men were also ordered to pay £85 in costs.

A spokesman for Intu, which owns the shopping centre, said: 'We do not tolerate any form of violence within the centre.

'The safety of our shoppers and staff is our number one priority and we called the police as soon as we were made aware of this incident.'

Uniformed security guards step in to stop the brawl. Police confirmed that they had been called and two arrests were made
