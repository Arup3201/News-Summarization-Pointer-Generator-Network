England's footballers have yet to get back on track with the public after their woeful World Cup but at least Virgin Trains are prepared to go out of their way for Roy Hodgson’s squad.

Travellers  from London Euston to Manchester who had booked first-class seats in the two most convenient carriages, were surprised to be relocated because of a block booking. Then the service stopped unexpectedly at Watford for the England party, who were on the way to a rare training stay at St George’s Park in Staffordshire, to board. They later disembarked at Lichfield Trent Valley, another unscheduled port of call.

The train announcer made no apology for running 12 minutes late due to looking after England’s needs. The FA said fans would approve of England travelling on public transport and it was an issue for Virgin where the train stopped.

Time: Virgin experienced delays to their service as one of their trains made extra stops for the England squad

A Virgin spokesman said: ‘We try to accommodate the requirements of the England team when we can and we don’t broadcast when they travel with us for security reasons. We apologise if any of our customers were inconvenienced.’

lncreasingly irrational talkSport pundit Stan Collymore seems to have got the wrong message from BBC approaches last May as to whether he would be available for Match of the Day 2 duties this season. Collymore announced it as a job offer, saying he received a ‘welcome aboard’ tweet from Gary Lineker. 

However the BBC confirmed yesterday that Collymore was only one of many being sounded out and that they have no current plans to use him on MotD programmes.

Captain: The PCA came out in support of Alastair Cook saying: 'Don't sack him - back him'

Eyebrows were raised around the cricket circuit after the Professional Cricketers Association, who look after all members of the players union, gave strong public support to England’s beleaguered one-day captain Alastair Cook. The PCA posted a number of tweets with the hashtag ‘Don’t sack him — BACK him’ detailing why Cook should remain at the helm of the 50-over side despite their dismal run of results. 

The campaign had the endorsement of PCA chief executive Angus Porter, who said: ‘We historically back the incumbent captain and we wanted to demonstrate that with Alastair having had such a difficult summer. We don’t feel it is inappropriate.’

There is understood to be further tension at Sky Sports News in the fall-out from their pantomime deadline day coverage. Newcomer Kate Abdo was chosen to work alongside Jim White and Natalie Sawyer on the flagship programme, which is believed to have upset some of the established presenters. 

Verdict: Trevor Brookingwill address the background to Harry Redknapp replacing Billy Bonds at West Ham

Sir Trevor Brooking, famous for sitting on the fence as a pundit, will nevertheless address the background to Harry Redknapp replacing Billy Bonds as West Ham manager in 1994 in his updated autobiography to be published this month.

Rather than give an opinion, Brooking details the events surrounding the sensitive change. Sir Trevor is a close friend of Bonds and has always taken his side. Indeed, there are those who believe his presence at the FA would have made it very difficult for Redknapp to become England manager. Brooking, now retired, glowingly described Bonds in the Wembley programme this week as ‘a colossus, a top, top man and an absolute leader.’

Wembley:  England vs Norway was watched by fewer people on television and at Wembley

The FA sadly will not throw the book at referee grandee David Elleray for making a ghastly racist comment. But window-dressing anti-discrimination initiatives to help black players and others from ethnic minority backgrounds develop careers after football will see former Huddersfield forward Iffy Onuora observe FA board meetings and Les Ferdinand attend the Wembley Stadium ones.

Wednesday's non-event against Norway, watched by the new Wembley’s lowest crowd for an England international, did however attract a reasonable peak viewing audience of 5.6m on ITV, although the 4.5m average was 1m down on recent friendlies. ITV, with exclusive rights to all England’s games until November 2017, should have concerns if ratings for next Monday’s European Championship qualifier in Switzerland — the most attractive game of the group — are not considerably higher.
