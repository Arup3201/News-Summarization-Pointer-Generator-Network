Former Arsenal forward Gervinho has issued a wholehearted apology after being sent off during the Ivory Coast's opening match in the African Cup of Nations.

The Roma player was dismissed after slapping Guinea forward in a seemingly unprovoked attack during a 1-1 draw in Equatorial Guinea. The 27-year-old, who reacted in remarkable fashion - throwing himself to the ground in disbelief.

Gervinho has now taken to social media to express his apology, writing on Twitter: 'I want to present my apologies to the Ivorian nation, my teammates, the fans and the ACN organizers for this angry gesture which is not like me, and who has no place recess on a football field.'

Shocked at the referee's decision, Gervinho was led from the pitch by his team-mates, although replays clearly showed the forward catching Keita.

Shortly after, Seydou Doumbia drew the Ivory Coast level, perhaps taking some heat off his team-mate's reckless decision.
