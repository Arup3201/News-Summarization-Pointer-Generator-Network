A Florida veterinary technician has been arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license after he allegedly gave his sick girlfriend a drug meant for her dog.

Cedrik Claude Merlet, 40, from Bradenton, was taken into custody Tuesday in connection to an incident that took place back in February.

According to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office, Mr Merlet, a veterinary Emergency technician at a Bradenton clinic, hooked up his girlfriend to an IV during what he believed was an asthma attack.

For man and beast: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate can be prescribed to human patients suffering from severe allergic reactions, arthritis, blood disease , internal, eye and skin disorders

Sheriff's deputies responded to Merlet's home in Bradenton just after midnight February 1 after receiving a report about a domestic incident.

The officers noted that the 40-year-old man smelled of alcohol and had slightly glassy and bloodshot eyes, according to Miami Herald. 

Merlet, a French national, told the deputies that his girlfriend got extremely drunk during an alcohol-fueled party and began throwing up.

Merlet, who had worked as a paramedic in New Jersey before moving to Florida in 2006, apparently came to the conclusion that the woman was having an acute asthma attack.

In an effort to help her, the veterinary technician injected saline into his girlfriend, according to officials.

Merlet admitted to the deputies that he administered 2 milligrams of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, which was left over from a prescription for the girlfriend’s dog.

The drug is a corticosteroid used to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in cats and dogs, as well as certain cancers and Addison’s disease.

A version of the drug can also be prescribed to human patients suffering from severe allergic reactions, arthritis, blood disease , internal, eye and skin disorders, as well as breathing problems.

Merlet's girlfriend, who is not being named, has told sheriff's investigators she only vaguely remembered being injected with something.

According to deputies, Mr Merlet did not seek medical help for his girlfriend and failed to mention that he injected her with a corticosteroid when he called 911 to report a domestic incident.

Merlet, who has a young son, was arrested Tuesday morning and taken to Manatee County Jail. He was released the same day without a bond.

First responder: Merlet, a native of France with a military experience, worked as a paramedic after emigrating to the US 

According to his profile on the website of his employer, Veterinary Emergency Center in Bradenton, Merlet is a native of France, where he served in the military and graduated from college with a bachelor’s' degree in biology before emigrating to the US.

After settling in NJ, Merlet worked as a rescue diver paramedic and the as a first responder for the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management.
