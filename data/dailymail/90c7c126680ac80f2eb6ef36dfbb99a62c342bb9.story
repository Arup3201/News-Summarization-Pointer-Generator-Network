Friends and family are grieving the loss of Brendan Hickey after he drowned at Sydney's Darling Harbour late on Friday night.

Police were told that the Irishman, who lived in Randwick, was sitting with three of his friends on the edge of a wooden pier to watch Sydney's Vivid light festival when he disappeared into the water just before 11pm.

A female friend and another man dove into the water fully clothed in a desperate bid to save him, but were unsuccessful in locating the 34-year-old.

After his brother Shane Hickey posted a photo of the pair of them smiling in green t-shirts on his Facebook page one friend, Suzanne Colgan, wrote:

'My thoughts are with you and your family... Bren was one of the greatest guys u knew, I'm devastated.'

'They were in the water for less than 40 seconds.'

Onlooker Stephan Odisho told the Telegraph: 'At first I thought someone had lost their wallet, and then it got really urgent with people jumping in.'

Witnesses said security men then came over to tell the two friends to get out of the water without realising what had just happened.

An extensive helicopter search was launched at 11pm while Police Rescue, Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority staff, security from nearby Home Nightclub and police officers joined forces to help look for the man by shining their torches into the pitch black water.
