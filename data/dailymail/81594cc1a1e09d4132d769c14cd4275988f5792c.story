Paula Radcliffe will race her final marathon in London in April, organisers have announced.

The world record holder, who last competed over 26.2 miles in Berlin in September 2011, will bring the curtain down on a glorious marathon career at the Virgin Money London Marathon on April 26.

The 41-year-old is a three-time winner of the London Marathon, but last took part in the race nine years ago.

Race director Hugh Brasher said: "We are absolutely thrilled that Paula has chosen London for her final marathon and we know the British crowds will be out in force on 26 April to celebrate her extraordinary career."

Radcliffe, who set her world record of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds on the streets of the capital in 2003, was not named among the elite athlete entries and will announce her plans for the race on January 30.

Defending champion Edna Kiplagat, the two-time world champion, will take on fellow Kenyan Florence Kiplagat, whom she beat to victory last year by just three seconds.

Two more Kenyans, Priscah Jeptoo and Mary Keitany, both former London Marathon champions, are also in the field.
