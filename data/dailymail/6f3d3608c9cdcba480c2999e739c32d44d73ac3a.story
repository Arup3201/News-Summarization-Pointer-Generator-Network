Thousands of students descended on a Cambridge park to celebrate an annual drinking party, despite being warned by their university colleges.

An estimated 2,000 Cambridge University students took part in the ‘Caesarian Sunday’ tradition, playing boozy games and enjoying semi-dressed antics in front of shocked families on Jesus Green.

A number of colleges emailed students last week urging them to ‘find a more fruitful way’ of spending their day than heading to the city centre park for the annual gathering.

They warned that any students ‘committing an offence’ would be subject to the disciplinary rules of their respective college and the University and to ‘appropriate police action’.

Caesarian Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term which ends with the notorious after-exams party, Suicide Sunday, in June.

With the sun out for the day, students started filling up the park at around midday wearing their university blazers and carrying bucket loads of alcohol.

An afternoon of drinking games followed, including, wrestling and undergraduates at the prestigious institution soaking each other with water pistols and bottles of wine just feet away from where children were playing.

The dress code depended on allegiance, with some drinking societies wearing Red Indian headdresses, while others wore blazers or togas.

A lot of the students, both male and female, could barely stand by the end of the afternoon and some hurled abuse at press photographers.

Caesarian Sunday historically takes place at Jesus Green in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term.

It is said to have started when a member of the Girton College’s Green Giants stole a bottle of Pimm’s from a member of the Jesus College Caesarians. The bottle was then thrown at the Caesarian in a challenge to fight.

It is now tradition that the president of Girton’s drinking society downs a bottle of Pimm’s and invites the Jesus College drinking society to fight.

But this year for the first time in 80 years the traditional fight did not take place after students were warned by their colleges to behave.

Professors at Jesus College had even tried to persuade the drinking societies to hold their traditional bash on its grounds, away from the public eye.

But their attempts failed because the undergraduates said they did not want to drink under supervision.

Last week Anthony Bowen, a Jesus fellow and a former University Orator, said last year's event was ‘deeply regrettable and embarrassing’ and ‘very unhelpful to the university’.

‘It's disappointing the fight couldn't go ahead as it happens every year, but both Girton and Jesus drinking societies were warned to keep things under control this year,’ said one student who did not want to be named.

‘There was an opportunity to have the event on university grounds but many felt it wouldn't be the same.

‘This is the last day we have to relax before revision and exams, so it's a chance to let off steam.’
