Singer and actress Courtney Love unwittingly employed a convicted blagger to obtain her British bank statements as she could no longer remember her account details, it was claimed last night.

Miss Love, 49, is believed to have opened up to ten Barclays accounts in the UK between 2006-2008, but lost her account numbers and sort codes and even forgot the name of the bank.

However, she became convinced that she had deposited millions of pounds into the accounts which she could no longer access, said a well-placed source.

Miss Love, the widow of the late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, approached a private security company called Greymans to see if it could help.

Greymans, which was closed down in 2011, was well known to  celebrities and high net-worth individuals as it provided bespoke private security and bodyguard protection. It also used to conduct investigations for its  wealthy clients.

Confidential emails seen by The Mail on Sunday show that investigators at Greymans turned to a convicted private detective called Adam John Spears to obtain Miss Love’s bank records.

Spears, 73, a former Met detective, then used a blagger called Daniel Summers, 34, to trace her supposedly  missing millions.

Spears and Summers were among the five suspects arrested in 2009 as part of Operation Millipede for blagging and unlawfully obtaining bank statements, mobile phone bills and even medical and police records of victims. Both Spears and Summers pleaded guilty and were sentenced at Kingston Crown Court last year.

The Mail on Sunday has seen emails from June 2008 in which Spears discusses Miss Love’s case with the then financial controller of Greymans, Andy Driver. In the emails, Miss Love is referred to by the code-name ‘Eustace’. One sent by Mr Driver to Summers is headed ‘Miss Love/Eustace’.

In an email received by Mr Driver, Spears says of Miss Love: ‘If I have it right, this is the “famous” client who seems to have mislaid her funds?’

Spears then tells Driver that he will get Summers to do a general ‘trawl’ of UK bank accounts to locate her money.

It is believed that Summers telephoned British banks pretending to be Miss Love, disguising his voice through a text-to-voice device designed for use by deaf people.

A source close to the SOCA investigation said that Summers found up to ten Barclays accounts belonging to Miss Love – but there were no millions.   ‘He just found a few pence and a few pounds in each,’ said  the source. 

The singer spent weeks at a time in London during 2007 as she performed a number of gigs in the capital.

It is believed she opened several bank accounts as she would withdraw thousands of pounds at a time during her stay in London.

The Mail on Sunday made repeated attempts to contact agents for Miss Love  by phone and email but received  no reply.
