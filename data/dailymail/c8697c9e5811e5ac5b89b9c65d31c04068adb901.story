The grand jury that is considering whether to charge the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown has been accused of misconduct, after a Tweet showing an apparent leak among the panel surfaced online.

The Twitter message - which was posted Wednesday morning but quickly deleted - suggested one member of the jury had been discussing the case with a friend.

The Tweet suggested that the jury had not seen enough evidence in the case to charge the officer at its center, Darren Wilson.

The trail started on August 20, just days after the shooting of 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed - and is confidential.
