Ghost hunter Zak Bagans, who presents TV show Ghost Adventures, has bought the house in Gary, Indiana, described as 'a portal to hell'

The basement of this house has been described as a 'portal to hell' filled with demons who tormented and possessed a mother and her three young children.

During the ordeal back in 2012 the walls of the house allegedly bled clear oil which 'froze' the finger of a social worker who touched it, and ghostly voices were recorded when police went to investigate.

So it may be surprising to learn that the property in Gary, Indiana, has now been bought for $35,000. It will be less surprising to learn that the new owner is 'ghost hunter' Zak Bagans.

Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, bought the house yesterday and says he has not decided exactly what to do with it, but added that it will probably involve research into the paranormal goings-on.

He told the Indy Star: 'It's not entertainment. I really do have a passion for this stuff and the research aspect of this stuff.'

The ordinary-looking property became world-famous five days ago after the case of Latoya Ammons, a previous owner, came to light.

In 2012 Ammos says that demons began to take over her house, that objects were thrown around, her children were possessed and that the whole family nearly lost their lives.

Social workers, psychiatrists, priests, police officers, doctors and nurses have all corroborated Ammons story, including one incident in which her son was taken to hospital where staff watched in horror as he climbed backwards up a wall before flipping over his mother's head.

Audio recordings taken by police as they went to investigate the paranormal activity also seem to back up the story, as a ghostly voice can be heard whispering 'hey' as the officers talk. Neither of the officers recall hearing the voice that day.

One man who did hear something, however, was Cary Indiana Police Captain Charles Austin, 62, who says after one trip to the property a growling voice came from his AM/FM radio saying 'you outta here' before it went back to static.

He was also there the day video footage was recorded of Ammos's mother giving a tour of the house. He entered a skeptic and left convinced that he had just witnessed a ‘portal to hell.’

In 2012 a mother and her three children were allegedly tormented and possessed by demons in this house. A spooky figure was pictured in the window, and audio recordings were made of ghostly voices

Latoya Ammons claims she and her three children were possessed and tormented by demons in the basement of her house

Speaking to MailOnline he said: ‘Everyone of us who was there that day in the basement and who saw what we saw, went through what we went through after…we all think the same, we all call it the same. That bit of dirt is a portal to hell.'

The unusual happenings also attracted the attention of local priest Father Michael Maginot, who also set out to disprove the accounts, but ended up performing one minor and three major exorcisms on Ammons and her family, and now swears that he has been targeted by demons himself.

Ammons also says she saw her daughter levitating above her bed, and a photograph has been widely circulated showing a shadowy figure standing by the window.

Zak Bagans has been producing Ghost Adventures since 2008, in which he tours haunted places with his camera crew, interviews locals about paranormal activity, investigates areas allegedly plagued by spirits and often confronts the ghosts.

According to his website, Mr Bagans became convinced of an afterlife in Trenton, Mississippi, in 2002 when he confronted the spirit of a suicidal woman in his apartment complex.

During the haunting Ammons says the house seeped a clear, odorless liquid, which she claims can be seen here

A social worker who touched the liquid apparently had her finger 'frozen' and then refused to go back

Yesterday Mr Bagans took to Twitter to say that he would address reports of him buying the house 'tomorrow'.

According to TMZ, he added: 'If it's true this home is a portal to hell, then I want to go there and see what happens.'

Apparently the current tenant, an unnamed woman, was happy to pass the lease on to him.

It has been reported that the woman has had no issues with the house herself, and has seen none of the things described by Ammons.

However Charles Reed, the current homeowner, said media interest in the house has been unbelievable — so much so that the tenant called Gary police to complain when reporters and photographers showed up.
