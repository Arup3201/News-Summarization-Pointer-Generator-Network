European Union member states have blocked plans to ban so-called ‘roaming’ charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices.

Most mobile companies slap the sky-high fees on people’s bills whenever they use their email, search the web, or use an online map to navigate, whilst they are overseas.

Customers can pay a small amount for special roaming packages, but people who fail to do this face eye-watering charges, even if they have used their mobile phone sparingly.

Change in direction: EU member states have done a U-turn on plans to ban so-called ‘roaming’ charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices

Often, they will find their bills tens or hundreds higher than usual. In some cases, customers have racked up thousands of pounds just by surfing the web on their mobiles whilst on holiday.

The European Commission had promised to axe the controversial fees by the end of 2015. However, the EU member states voted against that plan,so they will now remain in place until at least 2018, and could stay far into the future.

The move has sparked outrage amongst Brussels. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, said he would fight ‘vigourously’ to end roaming charges this year, and that ‘EU member states should hang their heads in shame’.

Neelie Kroes, the European Commission's former digital tsar first called for a ban on roaming charges in 2013.

The move was hugely unpopular with mobile operator, who rely on roaming charges to fatten the industry’s profits.

They argue that the roaming charges are necessary to cover the costs that they are charged by foreign operators for carrying data across their networks.

However, all mobile phone operators charge each other for this service, meaning that the whole industry is effectively taxing customers for using their phones overseas, and passing the money between them.

Now Mrs Kroes’ successors have rowed back on her policy, and said that mobile phone companies need more time to deal with the hole that a ban on roaming charges would put in their profits.

Instead, they have suggested that people using their mobile phones abroad should be given a discount on a small amount of roaming, and face standard roaming charges on whatever else they use.

At a meeting in Brussels, they said they would review the situation in 2018 to see if the market had come up with foreign roaming packages that offer customers better value for money. However, there is no guarantee that they would intervene, even at that point.

Mathew Howett, a telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: ‘They were going to be abolished but that has been pushed back more or less indefinitely. Customers are now relying on the market to deliver.’

A few mobile phone companies have taken steps to reduce so-called ‘bill shock’ for customers returning home from overseas. Vodafone invites customers to pay for a ‘passport’ whenever they travel overseas, whilst Three allows users to use the internet, and make as many texts and calls as they like, when they visit certain countries, as part of its ‘Feel at Home’ package.
