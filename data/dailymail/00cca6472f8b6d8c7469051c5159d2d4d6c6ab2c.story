Crash: Rebecca Knowles-Dixon, 28, (pictured) said kicks from her unborn child caused her to flinch and momentarily lose control

A heavily-pregnant driver who crashed into an elderly cyclist blamed the accident on her unborn baby kicking her.

Mother-to-be Rebecca Knowles-Dixon, 28, lost control of her car and drove into Graham Walden, 74, on a county road near Ashburton, Devon.

The pensioner was thrown 'some distance' from his bike and suffered serious chest and head injuries in the crash on September 6.

Appearing at Torquay Magistrates Court, Knowles-Dixon appeared blamed the crash on her unborn child.

She said a series of 'painful' kicks caused her to flinch behind the wheel and swerve in front of the pensioner.

Knowles-Dixon, of Waterleat, Devon, admitted driving without due care an attention at Torquay Magistrates Court.

Magistrates fined her £150 put three points on her driving license.

The court heard pregnant Knowles-Dixon was driving down a hill when she felt her baby kicking and swerved into a hedge.

The woman's Peugeot then ploughed into a hedge and veered into the path of the cyclist.

Her visibility was also poor because there was glare on her windscreen, the court heard.

Mr Walden was thrown from his bike and suffered chest and head injuries in the crash.

He was airlifted to hospital with fractured ribs and breathing difficulties, but survived the incident in a 'windy, narrow country road'.

Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said speed was not a factor in the crash because Knowles-Dixon was only doing 20mph.

She said she relied on her car to do festival work and losing it would cause her 'exceptional hardship'.

She also insisted that she always tried to drive as safely as possible.

She told the court: 'I was heavily pregnant at the time when the baby kicked me in the ribs several times and very hard.

'This made me flinch and caused me to have a momentary lapse in concentration.

'I could not have predicted what happened. It’s never happened to me before. It’s really quite painful.'

She told magistrates she had passed her driving test less than two years earlier and needed her car to take her baby to hospital to have an operation.

Knowles-Dixon, who represented herself, said she lived two miles from the nearest bus stop.
