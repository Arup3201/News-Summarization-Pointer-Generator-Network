Republican Senator Ted Cruz's father has revived the birther conspiracy theories by saying that the President should be sent 'back to Kenya, back to Indonesia'.

Rafael Cruz was speaking at an event on Fort Worth during his son's Senate campaign 2012.

The video was unearthed by Mother Jones, and Senator Cruz's staff is now trying to distance themselves from the man he has repeatedly called 'his hero'.

During the 2012 event, the elder Mr Cruz denounces the Obama administrations work and goes on to draw on the President's upbringing.

Speaking to the crowd: Rafael Cruz was at a campaign event for his son in Fort Worth in 2012 when he made the controversial remarks about how President Obama should be sent 'back to Kenya, back to Indonesia'

'The path of this administration is to make us a third world country and to make us second to the United Nations,' the 74-year-old Cruz is heard saying to the crowd.

He goes to espouse concerns about the United Nation's sustainable development implementation plan called Agenda 21, and the organization's Law of the Sea Treaty- both of which are lighning rods for conservatives who fear the overreach of outside organizations on national sovereignty.

'They are pushing very hard for the United Nations to have taxing authority and Obama is very much one of the big promoters of this,' he says.

'We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.'

His hero: Ted Cruz has refused to denounce the comments and has repeatedly spoken about how he looks up to his 74-year-old father Rafael

Making it clear that the speech was 
connected to the then-ongoing campaign that his son was waging, he 
followed the controversial statement with a concluding one after the 
applause broke: 'We absolutely need to retake the Senate.'

Mother Jones, the liberal website that published the video, is the same site that unearthed the video of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney writing off '47 per cent' of the American electorate who were not going to vote for him because they benefited from government handouts.

When the video was made public on Thursday, Senator Cruz's spokesman responded saying that Rafael did not speak for his son.

'These selective quotes, taken out of context, mischaracterize the substance of Pastor Cruz's message. Like many Americans, he feels America is on the wrong track,' the spokesman said according to the Fox News affiliate in Dallas-Fort Worth.

Focused on other things: The video emerged on Thursday while the President and First Lady greeted thousands of children to the White House as part of the Halloween festivities

The quote in question may become an issue for Senator Cruz, who is beloved by many Tea Party activists and has been frequently mentioned as a possible Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race.

If that ends up being a serious consideration, Cruz will have his own birthplace issues to deal with as he was born in Canada.

His father is a Cuban immigrant and his mother is American. The Senator has dual citizenship to Canada and America, and has said that if it becomes an issue he will renounce his Canadian citizenship.
