When the eyes of the world’s media are on you, sometimes it’s impossible to resist the temptation to play a prank.

And that is just what Prince Harry’s Scotland Yard protection officer did as the royal joined his brother William at a polo match.

Feigning alarm at something out of sight in the tent where the princes were changing, the plainclothes officer grabbed his ‘gun’ and struck a pose like that of an American secret serviceman.

Watch out: A man thought to be a royal protection officer for Princes William and Harry pretends to be a Secret Service-style security man at a charity polo match at Coworth Park in Ascot, Berkshire, yesterday

Having fun: The protection officer enjoyed himself as Prince William took a break from parenting duties to play in the Audi Polo Challenge with brother Prince Harry

The officer then sprinted inside the tent as a bemused colleague looked on.

In truth he was holding nothing more dangerous than his other hand, with
two fingers pointing upwards like the barrel of a gun.

It’s not the 
first time Harry’s bodyguard has been caught on camera.

Last August he was seen by Harry’s side, wearing a jaunty hat and 
swimming trunks, at a pool party in Las Vegas.

Photos of a naked Harry 
and an equally nude girl taken during that holiday would later cause 
controversy.

This weekend’s pictures were taken at Coworth Park in Ascot, Berkshire, 
and last night a former Yard protection officer justified the 
bodyguard’s antics.

‘These guys are working long hours and spending a 
lot of time standing around,’ he said. ‘They need to keep on the ball, 
and if that means playing a harmless joke to keep your mind active then 
no one has a problem with that.’

The polo match was the first time William has been seen in public since the birth of his son Prince George.

The Duchess of Cambridge attended last year’s match but yesterday she 
remained at her parents’ home in Bucklebury – and William joked about 
picking up nappies on his way home.

Two days ago Kensington Palace announced that the birth of the third-in-line to the throne had been formally registered after a registrar from Westminster City Council visited the palace.

William signed the birth register entry for his son, listing his and wife Kate's jobs as prince and princess of the United Kingdom.

The RAF search and rescue pilot is currently on paternity leave but is expected to return to work at some point next week. His next official public engagement will be to visit the Anglesey Show later this month.

Prince Philip, 92, will be in Edinburgh next Monday to carry out his 
first official engagement since having abdominal surgery two months ago.
