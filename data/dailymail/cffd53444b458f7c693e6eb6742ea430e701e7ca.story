Peter Ryley was given too many sedatives at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham which led to him falling and dying

A Grandfather with dementia suffered a fatal fall in hospital after being given a cocktail of drugs to ‘keep him quiet’.

Peter Ryley, 76, smashed his head on the floor and suffered a brain haemorrhage after excessive amounts of  sedatives left him ‘practically delirious’.

Nurses found him, unconscious and bleeding, 40 minutes after he was given three doses of powerful drugs in just five minutes.

The married father of four, who had been admitted to hospital with bowel problems, died five days after the fall.

The NHS trust in question has apologised and admitted full responsibility for Mr Ryley’s death, after his family instructed lawyers to investigate whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy.

Staff had failed to act after a risk assessment recommended steps to prevent the retired steel worker from seriously injuring himself on the ward.

The Mail has long called for an improvement in care of dementia sufferers as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Yesterday Mr Ryley’s family told of their anger and devastation at how he was stripped of his dignity, and given a chemical cosh by those who should have been caring for him.

Son Andrew, 44, said: ‘Dad’s dementia meant he did need a lot of care – but rather than reassuring him and trying to keep him occupied, it came to light at the inquest that the medical staff just kept increasing his sedation levels.

‘In the end he was practically delirious from all the drugs he had been given, but no steps were taken by the nurses to prevent him from being a danger to himself.

‘We’ve been left devastated by the way Dad was treated. He should have been shown some dignity and respect in his final days, but sadly the main goal of the nurses and doctors was to keep him quiet. The hospital have apologised, but the apology felt empty.’ 

Chief executive of the hospital Peter Homa said: 'I wish to reiterate the Trust's sincere apologies to his family for the fatal head injury Mr Ryley sustained after falling in our care'

Research by the British Journal of General Practice has shown that one in four dementia sufferers are treated with 'last resort' antipsychotic drugs.Antipsychotics are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in patients with mental illnesses.

But researchers have found that in most cases they are just given to sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off.

The drugs – dubbed a ‘chemical cosh’ – have been found to double the risk of death and actually worsen patients’ symptoms leaving them unable to walk or speak coherently.

In 2011, the Department of Health warned the drugs were leading to 1,800 needless deaths a year.

Around 770,000 Britons are thought to have some form of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease.

But it is not known how many are being given antipsychotics or how long they have been on them.

Research has also shown that dementia patients in care homes in some parts of England are six times more likely to be prescribed the drugs than in other areas.

Mr Ryley, of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, was
 given a sedative soon after being admitted to Queen’s Medical Centre in
 Nottingham on January 3, 2011.

The doses continued throughout the 
following days, despite a doctor expressing concerns that he should not 
receive any more drugs.

Three days later, a falls risk-assessment identified him as a high-risk 
patient. As a result,  a care plan recommended additional night staff to
 help care for him, and for a nurse to be visible at all times. It also 
suggested lowering his bed.

None of these steps were taken, and on January 17 Mr Ryley suffered the 
fall which later killed him. X-rays show he suffered a severe brain 
haemorrhage.

He had been married to Patricia, 72, for 40 years, and had ten 
grandchildren. Andrew Ryley said: ‘It soon became clear that staff were 
so overstretched they didn’t have the necessary resources to care for 
him. 

‘The hospital report says he was given Diazepam. Five minutes later he 
was given 1milligram of Lorazepam and 50mg of Tramadol.

Just 40 minutes 
later he was found on the floor by nurses.’ A post-mortem examination 
found that Mr Ryley’s system contained high levels of the three 
aforementioned drugs, as well as another sedative, Zopiclone.

An inquest last September found Mr Ryley died as a result of the head 
injury sustained in the fall.

In a narrative verdict, the coroner noted a
 ‘continuing use of excess sedation’ and an ‘ongoing omission to fully 
comply with fall-prevention policies’.

Peter Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS 
Trust, said: ‘I wish to reiterate the trust’s sincere apologies to Mr 
Ryley’s family for the fatal head injury he sustained after falling in 
our care.’

The trust – one of six branded ‘high risk’ for patient care by the Care 
Quality Commission last week – is addressing several failings that were 
identified in an internal investigation. These steps include new 
guidelines for sedating agitated patients, and providing more dementia 
support on every ward.
