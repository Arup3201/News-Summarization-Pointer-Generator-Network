An innocent bus driver was repeatedly stabbed in the head by a woman after she mistook him for someone who had threatened her, a court has heard.

Veraty Johnston, 27, attacked her terrified victim three or four times with the two-inch bladed multi-tool on the bus while shocked commuters looked on.

She cried out 'rape' before launching herself on the 61-year-old busman. The savage attack left the innocent man cut, soaked in blood and in deep shock.

Johnston, of Norwich, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm before city magistrates.

The driver, who has not been named, was on his way to work.

He was sitting with a colleague at the front of the vehicle as it approached the bus station when he was attacked.

The bizarre incident caused huge early morning rush-hour disruption as the air ambulance was scrambled to the scene.

Johnston had mistaken the man for someone who she claimed had threatened her in Dereham two days before, the court heard.

Lisa Britton, prosecuting, said the driver got on the number 8 Konectbus 7.35am service from Dereham to Norwich with a colleague at about 7.10am on May 1.

Miss Britton said: 'After about 20 minutes the defendant boarded the bus.

'She approached the victim and asked if she could take his seat. He got up and sat next to his colleague.

'There was no conversation between the victim and the defendant on the journey.

'At 8.15am the bus was coming in to Norwich city centre. The victim felt a blow to the top of his head.

'The woman had hit him with a red-handled multi-tool with a two-inch blade.'

She added: 'He said she was standing over him with the knife raised in her hand, as if she was going to strike him again.

"I know you," she shouted at him. "Rape"

'He told her to calm down, as he could feel blood running down the side of his face.

'He had a one centimetre cut to his head, which was treated by paramedics at the scene.

'He did not need hospital treatment but was in shock and said he had never seen the woman before.

'Police arrived and arrested Johnston.'

Johnston told officers she had been threatened by a man who said he was going to get her and her family just 48 hours earlier.

She said she thought the victim was the culprit.

Johnston, who is receiving treatment at Hellesdon Hospital, Norwich, for mental illness, was well enough, according to doctors, to attend court and plead.

Dave Foulkes, defending, said: 'She fully accepts the victim was not known to her.

'She was taken to Hellesdon Hospital where she was sectioned under the Mental Health act.

'More recently she has been staying at the hospital voluntarily.

'She's receiving treatment and feeling well.'

The case was adjourned for reports to September 16 and Johnston was bailed.

Konectbus said at the time that the driver, of Attleborough, Norfolk, had been with the firm for less than a fortnight but had been a bus driver for 20 years.

A company spokesman last night refused to comment further.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
