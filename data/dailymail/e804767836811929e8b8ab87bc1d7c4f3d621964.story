Do you know two people who are just perfect for each other? Well, now there's an app for that.

Hitch, is being touted as the Tinder for matchmakers, as it lets people set up two Facebook friends.

Named after the Will Smith film about a romantic guru who helps singles find love, the idea for the app was inspired after founder Anton Gu met a mutual friend one night but felt too bashful to ask his chums for her number.

Dating app Hitch can be used whether you're single or in a relationship: users can set up two of their Facebook friends and introduce them with a personal message

Potential matchmakers just need to log into Facebook and select two friends they want to introduce and send them a message saying why they'd be a good match.

Although singles are set up with each other anonymously initially, matchmakers can see how many messages the pair have exchanged once they've chosen to reveal their identities.

The idea for the app all stemmed from a thwarted encounter.

Founder Anton, from London, said: 'In February last year I went to a gig with a group of friends. There was a girl in the group  that I hadn’t met before who was a friend of a friend. 

'She didn’t stay for very long and left, so I didn’t get a chance to talk to her.

'The next day I was sitting at home, thinking how could I get in touch with her. Short of asking our mutual friend for her number and being like “Hey, I’m that guy at the gig last night, I’d like to take you out”, I had nothing.

Hitch founder Anton Gu says the idea behind the app was simple: 'I was single. I made an app.' And it's not only been a professional success for Anton, but a romantic one too 

To create a hitch, you log in through Facebook and select two friends you want to introduce. The pair do not need to have the app installed to be selected - you can invite them later.

'I checked online and there was no app that I could use to get an introduction. So we made it.'

And since that night, he's used his  creation to  improve his own love life.

He said: 'By the time the app was out, that girl from the gig was dating someone. But my friend introduced me to someone else. She is incredible and we are dating now.'

Hitch is available in 50 countries and around 2,000 hitches are made in the UK each month.

Anton said: 'We grew very quickly in India. Matchmaking is popular in their culture, people understand the concept straight away and tell their friends about it. There is also huge potential in markets where online dating is difficult.'

He said that because matches are being made through pools of mutual friends, it narrows down choices and feels reliable as friends are making the introductions.

Mr Gu says the 'pick-up line' is always the same. Having a mutual friend makes communication very easy, meaning that 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation

Friends know better: Hitch is available to download in 50 countries, and users have increased particularly quickly in India, where matchmaking is a popular culture 

He added that women are better matchmakers than men. 'There’s a lady in Texas, she has introduced 14 couples on Hitch. She’s really good at this! 

Recruitment consultant Joel Holford, 22, from London, is currently using Hitch but needs more friends to download it before he can see it transforming his love life.

He said: 'I liked the idea of both setting up my friends and being set up anonymously. I downloaded the app, but the issue is, you have to have a lot of friends on there for it to work.'

Anton says he hopes awareness of Hitch will continue to grow. He said: 'We think that people that are successful, will in turn tell their friends how they met  and introduce them.'

Joel Holford, 22, says he likes the idea of Hitch, but points to the fact that it relies on many of your friends having the app too
