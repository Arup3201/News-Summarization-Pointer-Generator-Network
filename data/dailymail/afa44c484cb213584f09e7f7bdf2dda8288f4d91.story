Her political career has long been a butt of jokes for Saturday Night Live.

So to toast the show's 40th birthday on Sunday night, Sarah Palin offered up some new material. 

Arriving at Studio 8H in her daughter's four-year-old silver mini dress, the former governor of Alaska joked about running for president, jesting that it would be great news for SNL's writers.

In a skit with Jerry Seinfeld, she asked how much the show would pay her to run for president in 2016.

Seinfeld balked: 'No figure is too high Sarah!'

She raised the stakes: 'What if I had Donald Trump as my running mate?'

He replied: 'Now you're just teasing us!'

Palin became a source of comedy inspiration for the show during her vice-presidential campaign alongside John McCain in 2008.

Tina Fey developed a popular skit impersonating the Tea Party poster mom, which reached a climax when Palin herself made a cameo. 

The sketch drew in the show's highest overnight rating since 1994, with about 17 million viewers.

But it didn't do wonders for Palin's political aspirations.

After the episode aired, polls showed voters overwhelmingly agreed that Palin was unqualified for the role of vice president.

Speaking on the red carpet on Sunday night outside New York's Rockerfeller Center, Palin remembered the skit fondly.

She told Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie: 'If this is indicative of the campaign, it was the most fun moment of the campaign.' 

Alongside Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, Palin hailed the show as a center for 'the most intelligent and comedic minds in America in one place.'

But she was then caught in an awkward exchange with Alec Baldwin - with whom she shared an awkward cold open of SNL in 2008.

She joked to him: 'I still prefer your brother!'

Baldwin retorted: 'Of course you do,' before adding: 'We get to relax and have fun regardless of people’s politics. 

'And I often think, if only Lorne Michaels could produce the Congress, maybe we’d have more fun and we would get more done.'
