The Kiwi Government is on a mission to convince 50,000 Australians to move to New Zealand.

For the first time ever the country is holding jobs expos around Australia to showcase the Kiwi lifestyle and help local companies hire the skilled workers they are lacking.

New Zealand Employment Minister Steven Joyce says the country is facing skills shortages across a range of industries, and with the Kiwi unemployment rate at just 5.4 percent compared to Australia's 6.2 percent he thinks it's the perfect time for Aussies to move across the ditch.

'There is a bit of rivalry between the two countries but it always has been my genuine view that we should as two countries consider it as a single labour market,' Mr Joyce told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's traditionally been a Kiwi in Australia story but why shouldn't it be the other way around?

'It's a wonderful experience to work in New Zealand, we have excellent ski fields, it's a great place to bring up a family, the commutes are shorter and it's a positive, buzzy place.'

This comes as figures show New Zealand lost just 5300 people to Australia in the past year – the smallest loss in 20 years.

And Statistics NZ said Australia was the biggest source of arrivals at 22,721 migrants in the year to October, with many of those New Zealanders returning home.

The country's economy has been growing steading and it is facing skills shortages in a number of industries

Mr Joyce said this was an amazing change.

'We had a tough time of the GFC, then of course had the earthquakes,' he said.

'But the economy's been growing quite strongly for the past couple of years so we are starting to see significant skills shortage in parts of the country and in different industries.'

Mr Joyce said unemployment in the South Island was much lower than the national average at 3.4 per cent, adding that it was extremely difficult for businesses there to find experienced staff.

Across the country, there are skills shortages in the construction, IT and manufacturing industries in particular, he said.

'The construction industry is very important – for example in Christchurch we've got a whole CBD to build so there's at least five years' work there,' Mr Joyce said.

Mr Berry said the market was similar but Kiwis had distinct differences in the way they like to do business

He said the IT industry was looking for people experienced in software design and New Zealand had certain niches cornered in the manufacturing industry, including in fruit sorting equipment and emergency service boats, which were crying out for staff.

At the New Zealand Jobs Expo in Sydney, to be held at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday and Sunday, almost 40 companies with 1200 immediate vacancies will run stalls.

At a similar expo in Perth last weekend, 35 companies attended to talk to potential job candidates.

Tony Patane moved to New Zealand in April after completing a four-year electrician's apprenticeship in Townsville in Queensland but struggling to find work.

The 31-year-old said when he arrived in Christchurch, a job in his field was easy to get.

'Over here they see to be a little bit relaxed and it's easier to find a job,' Mr Patane said.

'There's plenty of work on.'

Sebastian Berry, who is commercial director at digital advertising technology firm Multiscreen Media, moved to Auckland in July to expand his business.

The 35-year-old, from Sydney, said he was enjoying learning how to operate in New Zealand, where the market was similar but Kiwis had distinct differences in the way they like to do business.

'They're more direct than Australians and much more relationship based,' Mr Berry said.

'Socially or in business, people care about who they deal with and they have a strong sense of honour around that.'
