 A couple obsessed with super heroes saved their own day and organised  an unforgettable wedding on a shoestring budget after the bride-to-be lost her job in the run-up to their nuptials.  

Newlyweds Becky and Steve Mear had planned to tie the knot in a traditional white wedding until she was made redundant.

But the thrifty couple didn't let that dampen their spirits and organised a low-cost wedding based around their geeky fascination with comic book characters - for just £5,500.

Becky and Steve had a traditional white wedding for the service, then in true Superman style - transformed the reception venue into a haven for comic book characters 

Becky, 23, and Steve, 25, from Derby, incorporated their love for cartoon heroes and villains into their unique wedding reception when they got married in April this year.

The reception had a dress code with a difference too, as guests also got into the spirit and dressed as their super heroes, like Batman, Iron Man and Spiderman.

Becky said: 'We had originally planned to have our wedding at a 4* hotel but when I lost my job we had to change everything.

'But looking back now, it was the best thing that could have happened to us because we got to do everything we wanted - and we could be as nerdy as we wanted.

 The clue is in the details: Becky and Dave went all out to add a superhero touch to every aspect of the wedding

'And the hotel would have been thousands of pounds more expensive as well.

'We are both really nerdy and we wanted to show that side of our personalities in our wedding - we just didn't want it to be like every other wedding.

'At first we wanted a Batman wedding then the theme changed to superheroes.

Guests were encouraged to come to the reception dressed as their favourite superheroes 

Spiderman and Superman were favorite costumes for many of the males guests 

Even the wedding band got in on the act - dressing up as Superman for their set 

'Steve is my very own Ironman and I will always love his geeky side.'

The couple, who met four-years-ago after they were introduced by a mutual friend at a local pub, saved money by making their own decorations and buying items on eBay.

A family friend even created a bespoke Batman-inspired tiered cake for the pair - and, not surprisingly the most expensive item was Becky's beautiful white wedding dress.

Nothing was left to chance: The decorations for the venue were also superhero themed 

Volunteer youth worker Becky said: 'We made all our decorations ourselves and just bought all the supplies off eBay and other sites.

'We planned a traditional church ceremony, then had a nerdy reception and evening do.

'We wanted to keep the ceremony traditional as that is the more serious bit so we didn't want it to be a joke. But it just made the rest of the day feel so us.

'We also asked all of our guests to dress up as superheroes or villains, and how they interpreted that was up to them.'
