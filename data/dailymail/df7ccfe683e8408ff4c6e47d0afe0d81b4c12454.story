This huge polar bear resembles a finely carved statue as he is captured hurling himself backwards into a pool in this stunning photograph.

The 1,000lb predator launched himself acrobatically into the air before crashing down into the water with his giant paws outstretched.

Named Nikita, the seven-year-old animal was pictured by photographer Jeff Rumans in a variety of poses as he larked around in his pool in Kansas Zoo.

Beauty: Nikita the polar bear shows off his acrobatic skills as he hurls himself backwards into the water at Kansas Zoo

Power: The seven-year-old male polar bear splashed around in his exhibit and blew bubbles while posing underwater for photographer Jeff Rumans

Posing: In another picture, he flaps his powerful paws into the air as he appears to swim backstroke through the water

The animal appeared to be showing off for his mate, Berlin, as she looked on from the side of the pool.

In one of the remarkable underwater 
shots Nikita is pictured blowing bubbles from his nose while staring at 
the camera.

In another, he flaps his powerful paws into the air as he appears to swim backstroke through the water.

The bear is later pictured drying off by the side of the pool as he took a break from his splashing antics.

Polar bears are native to the Arctic Circle and surrounding seas and land masses. The bear is the world's largest land-based carnivore and also the largest bear, together with the Kodiak bear.

They have excellent swimming skills which are necessary to help them hunt seals - their main prey in the wild.

Impressed: Nikita's female companion, Berlin, watches on while he splashes around in the pool

Drying out: The 1,000lb polar bear dries out after his eye catching antics in the water
