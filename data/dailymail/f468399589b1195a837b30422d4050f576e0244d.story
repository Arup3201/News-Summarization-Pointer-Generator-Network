Jon Snow, pictured with wife Precious Lunga, wrote of the unpleasant memories of his own abuse that had been brought up by the Savile scandal

Jon Snow told yesterday how the Jimmy Savile scandal has forced him to relive the abuse he suffered as a child.

The Channel 4 News veteran described how when he was six years old he was ‘abducted’ by a member of the domestic staff at the school where his father taught.

‘He took me to his room and undressed me, and then himself. Thank heavens someone saw the abduction and eventually a member of staff intervened and rescued me,’ he said.

‘I remember to this day fretting over not being able to do my braces up.

'And I admit I have found Savile regurgitating the guilt and confusion I felt.’

Mr Snow first wrote about the abuse he suffered in his autobiography Shooting History, published in 2004.

Yesterday he wrote on his blog on Channel 4’s website that the Savile saga was having a ‘vast effect’ on many abuse victims, with the ‘swirl of allegation and denial that is filling the airwaves’ leading many, like him, to relive what happened to them.

In the blog article, titled ‘Our sexual watershed’, Mr Snow, 65, added: ‘When I started in television more than three decades ago, many of the few women in the newsroom were treated first and foremost as sex objects and only secondarily journalists. Remarks about physique and “sexiness” were rife.

‘There was improper touching too, a needless brushing in passing, a pinched bottom.’

He described how the bar was ‘in-house’ and inexpensive, many would start drinking at lunchtime and it was ‘commonplace for some newscasters to go to air the worse for wear’.

Jon Snow said revelations about Savile exposed tolerance to gross misbehaviour if the celebrity was big enough

‘And if that was happening in the news divisions, Savile tells us about what was happening in entertainment,’ he added.

Oxford educated Mr Snow said the Savile affair had ‘exposed the institutional tolerance of the established media to gross misbehaviour, so long as the celebrity was big enough’.

He praised the ‘courageous’ victims of Savile who have come forward to speak publicly about what he did to them, so inspiring others to come forward to expose their abusers.

‘This is a dramatic moment in the affairs of men and women; we shall all be tested,’ he said. ‘But don’t underestimate what this time means to the abused. I know.’

He said the contrast with today 
is ‘acute’ and he knows ‘almost no one who drinks at lunchtime or indeed
any time before the working day is done’.

‘One
small comfort we can take is that many of us have truly been through a 
genuine sexual revolution - both in attitudes and behaviourally.’

Oxford-educated Mr Snow became the main 
presenter of Channel 4 News in 1989. For 35 years his partner was human 
rights lawyer Madeleine Colvin, with whom he has two daughters. In 2010 
he married Precious Lunga, a Zimbabwe-born academic.
