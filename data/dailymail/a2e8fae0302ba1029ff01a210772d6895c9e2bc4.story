For some models, pulling off a rock 'n roll pose might prove a challenge.

Not so for Georgia May Jagger though, whose rock 'n roll and modelling breeding could not be more impeccable.

The daughter of Rollling Stone Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall, she is perfectly placed to both pout to perfection, while at the same time showcasing the clothing - from H&M's forthcoming Rock 'n Roll Mansion collection - with aplomb.

Georgia, 20, was photographed by legendary fashion snapper Terry Richardson for the campaign, and along with Richardson and the crew, took over a Parisian mansion where they shot the clothing surrounded a set of suitably rock 'n roll elements like motorbikes, drumkits and guitars.

Influences: Music creates a certain mood, says Georgia, strumming on one of the guitars strewn around the set

Rock progeny: 'I think music influences fashion and has done so for generations,' says Georgia. 'Music creates a certain mood and then people dress accordingly. I think it's all quite closely intertwined'

Among the collection, she posed in a studded white biker jacket and tie-dye jeans mixed with boucle jackets and a belted shift dress.

'I love the dress,' says Georgia. 'It's such a versatile piece, and full of new rock 'n' roll spirit.'

Georgia's own style reflects the mix in the collection. 'I don't really have an everyday look,' she says. 'I wear what makes me feel good. It can be skinny jeans one day, and dresses and boots another.'

Georgia, who turns 21 this month, is committed to her career in fashion.

'I'm really enjoying what I'm doing at the moment," she says. 'I'm still so young so it's hard for me to imagine what I might be doing in ten years time. I really like photography, so it would be great to do more of that in the future.'
