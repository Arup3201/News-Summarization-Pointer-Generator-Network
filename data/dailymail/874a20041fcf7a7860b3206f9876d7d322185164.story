Sir John - who is survived by his wife Maryanna and three children - was knighted for Services to Music in the Millennium Honours list

The classical composer Sir John Tavener has died aged 69.

Prince Charles led tributes last night to the musician whose haunting Song For Athene was played at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.

Clarence House said the Prince of Wales was saddened to hear of the death of Sir John, his favourite British composer.

He died peacefully at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset, yesterday.

Sir John first came to public attention when he joined the Beatles’ Apple record label in the 1960s as a classical musician among rock and pop acts.

Knighted for services to music in the millennium honours list, he achieved commercial and critical success with compositions that drew on his rich spiritual beliefs.

Born in Wembley Park, North London, in 1944, he became the organist at St John’s Presbyterian Church in Kensington at the age of 15, and played there until the 1970s.

While he had a Presbyterian upbringing, he joined the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977.

After completing studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he premiered his avant-garde oratorio The Whale at the London Sinfonietta’s first concert in 1968 before it was released by Apple.

He established himself as a leading composer with his choral masterpieces The Lamb and Ikon Of Light in the early 1980s.

In the late 1960s he was famously signed to The Beatles' record label Apple and his music was notably performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess Of Wales, in 1997

He was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1992 for The Protecting Veil, which topped the classical charts for several months, and in 1997 for Svyati, a collaboration with the cellist Steven Isserlis.

Sir John, who was 6ft 6in tall, suffered a stroke in 1979 and was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome – a disorder of the body’s connective tissues – 11 years later. He said his fear of death left him once he was diagnosed.

‘Before my illness I’d always had a morbid fear of death,’ he said. ‘But death has become one’s spouse. It’s not terrifying any more.’

He suffered a series of heart attacks in 2007, had bypass surgery and was in a coma for six months.

During his illness, Sir John’s wife 
Maryanna played Mozart to him. ‘I apparently, in my unconscious state, 
began conducting. So that brought me round again,’ he said.

In the last years of his life, he was in constant pain and suffered from shortness of breath.

Last night James Rushton, the managing director of Sir John’s publisher Chester Music, said he ‘was one of the unique and most inspired voices in music of the last 50 years’.

He added: ‘His large body of work – dramatic, immediate, haunting, remaining long in the memory of all who have heard it, and always identifiably his – is one of the most significant contributions to classical music in our times.

‘For all of those fortunate enough to have known him, John was a man of strong beliefs, huge personal warmth, loyalty and humour. He will be much missed.’

The leading composer and conductor Sir Peter Maxwell Davies said: ‘John’s contribution to spiritual music was immense and his death is a great loss to the world of spiritual music.’

Sir John is survived by his wife and their three children Theodora, Sofia and Orlando.
