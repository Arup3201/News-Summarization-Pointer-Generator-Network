Brian Moore and Gary Neville this week became the latest high-profile former international sports stars to back the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign.

Former England rugby international Moore, now a highly respected television and radio commentator, praised the work done by the paper in promoting head-injury awareness and called for fellow commentators to stop trivialising incidences of concussion.

Speaking at a concussion forum held by the British Association of Sports Lawyers at Chelsea’s football ground Stamford Bridge, former solicitor Moore said: ‘There have been a number of factors which have seen the issue of concussion gain so much attention but, when it comes to UK sport, the Mail on Sunday’s campaign has been the driving force.

Moore, here in his heyday for England taking on the Soviet Union, says commentators must take concussion seriously and not trivialise head injuries as 'just a bang'

‘As we learn more, it’s vital that commentators take this issue seriously and stop saying silly things like "it’s only a bang" when someone suffers a concussion.’

While Moore hailed the Mail on Sunday’s campaign, former Manchester United star Neville has thrown his support behind the ‘Justice for Jeff’ campaign, which began in April after this newspaper revealed potentially life-saving research promised by football’s authorities following Jeff Astle’s death was never completed.

Astle died aged 59 in 2002 suffering early on-set dementia – which has since been diagnosed as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy also found in American Footballers, rugby players and boxers – and last week Neville attended a meeting with the former West Bromwich Albion’s striker’s family and Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor to urge further action.

FA chairman Greg Dyke recently committed to carry out research into the link between head injuries and early onset dementia in football and the PFA has now followed suit.

‘We’re really encouraged by the PFA’s promise to support research and back the Jeff Astle Foundation,’ said Astle’s daughter Dawn.

‘It’s early days and we need to work together but it appears we are moving in the right direction after more than a decade of believing research had been carried out when in fact it hadn’t.’

Meanwhile the International Rugby Board has launched a promotional video urging all clubs to heed their ‘recognise and remove’ message while UEFA has introduced new rules allowing referees to halt a game for three minutes if a concussion is suspected.
