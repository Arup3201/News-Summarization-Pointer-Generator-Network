Wales manager Chris Coleman has backed Gareth Bale to make an impact against Cyprus on Monday after firing a blank during Friday's game with Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Despite going close with a brilliant strike late on during the 0-0 draw at the Cardiff City Stadium, Bale failed to get on the scoresheet for Wales, but Coleman is confident the Real Madrid man will respond against Cyprus.

He said: ‘We say to the lads: you keep a clean sheet and he will have an impact. He will nearly score or he will score in any game. Even if he’s not on the top of his game he will get something.’

Coleman has admitted Wales are down to the ‘bare bones’ for the visit of the Cypriots on Monday night after Jonny Williams was forced out through an ankle injury.

The Crystal Palace midfielder, on loan at Ipswich, performed well in place of Aaron Ramsey against Bosnia but suffered a number of heavy challenges and was wearing strapping around his left lower leg on Sunday.

Coleman was already short of options in that part of the pitch, with Ramsey joined on the sidelines by Joe Allen, David Vaughan, Andrew Crofts and Lee Evans.

It likely means a promotion to the starting line-up for Hal Robson-Kanu in a Euro 2016 qualifier Wales need to win at the Cardiff City Stadium.

‘Our one loss is Jonny Williams, he’s not going to be available,’ said Coleman. ‘There were two or three heavy challenges on him and he’s paid his price.

‘It’s another midfielder in a position we didn’t want to lose, but we still have enough to get the win.

‘It is bare bones But as I said there is enough about us. Team spirit, you need it. We’ve got it. We’ve got enough to be positive going into this game.

‘I’m not going to apologise if at times it’s not very pretty as long as we get the result. Everybody has a job to do, a role to play. We’ve found that out. We went to Belgium with 15 players missing in the last campaign and we got a point.

‘We’ve got a lot missing in midfield this time, but we keep marching on, it won’t be an excuse, we have enough good enough players to get the result we want.’
