A U.S. citizen quarantined in Ghana suspected of having Ebola has tested negative for the deadly disease.

The Ministry of Health said preliminary tests undertaken by the Noguchi Memorial Research Institute proved negative.

It said the American, who has not been named, had previously visited Guinea and Sierra Leone - countries where Ebola has killed hundreds.

He arrived in Ghana and went to the Nyaho clinic in Accra with a fever. He was then quarantined along with the doctor and two nurses who treated him, Citi News reports.

According to Joy News, the Head of Disease Surveillance at the Ghana Health Service said the American had tested 'tentatively negative' and that more tests will be carried out to confirm the negative result.

Badu Sarkodie said: 'What it means is that whatever they [scientists who tested blood samples of the suspect victims] have done is not complete and there is the need for follow up tests.'

Tests were being conducted at Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research in Accra. It urged the public to remain calm. 

Health officials have called for regional action to halt the world's deadliest outbreak of the disease, which has spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing at least 467 people since February.

Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea and kills up to 90 percent of those it infects. Highly contagious, it is transmitted through contact with blood or other fluids.

A previous suspected Ebola case in Ghana tested negative in April.
