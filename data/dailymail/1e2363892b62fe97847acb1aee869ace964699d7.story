Police in New Hampshire are investigating a violent home invasion of a prominent doctor's home that left him clinging to life as his wife is treated for minor injuries.

Dr. Eduardo Quesada, 52, and his wife Sonia were attacked in their Bedford home on Saturday after an apparent break-in at their 2.7 acre $1.4million property.

Dr. Eduardo Quesada and his wife were attacked in their Bedford home on Saturday night. Their 2-year-old child who was in the house was not hurt

Though they initially reported it as a home invasion-burglary, all theories are being investigated in the wake of new revelations that the doctor was arrested last year for a domestic assault.

Dr Quesada faced simple assault and obstructing the report of a crime or injury from the November 2011 domestic disturbance call but they were dropped.

'We're not making any connections at this point,' said police chief John Bryfonski.

Police have remained tight-lipped about the investigation aside from saying that they do have a person of interest in custody.

Investigators assisted by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration have said that the house is still an active crime scene and that when they were called to the property they recovered the couples two-year-old child unharmed from inside.

'The homeowners were obviously confronted by a person or persons of interest,' Chief Bryfonski of the Bedford police said.

'We're looking for and expanding the search for evidence at the scene to help investigators unravel what may have happened there Saturday night.'

Police were called to the Manchester home about 10pm Saturday by Sonia Quesada.

The doctor's 
wife was able to rush to her neighbour's home covered in blood after escaping her assailant and knock 
on their door to raise the alarm.

Police said that Mrs. Quesada had been attacked but was only able to provide a vague description of her assailant.

'Very, very general and nonspecific and not something that would be useful or helpful to release at this point,' Bryfonski said.

Arriving at the home, police 
discovered the couple's two-year-old child and Dr. Quesada lying on the 
floor so injured that police initially thought he was dead.

Police
have not yet released exact details of his injuries or what caused them
and his wife is still being kept in the hospital for observation too.

Bedford Police have insisted that they do have a person of interest but are not going to ask the public for their help with their investigation

'The
focus of this case was the couple and maybe, in particular, the doctor 
and they went there with intention to perhaps steal something but 
perhaps harm the doctor,' Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent and ABC News consultant, said.

Authorities will not say whether the family was targeted, or whether anything was stolen.

The house was put on the market for $1.4million and was in contract at the time of the attack.

While
the police keep their cards close to their chest the involvement of the
DEA and Dr. Quesada's position as a respected anesthesiologist at the 
Elliot Hospital Pain Management Center in Manchester may be linked.

'It could have potentially been a 
hostage situation,' chief Bryfonski said. 'That was a 
consideration, that was part of the plan, but the overarching concern 
was the safety of the homeowner and the child.'
