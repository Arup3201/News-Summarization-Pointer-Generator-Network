Radamel Falcao was supposed to be one of Colombia's key players in their first World Cup appearance since 1998.

But with injury having cruelly ruled the Monaco star out of the tournament, the striker has instead decided to spend the summer on the beaches of Miami rather than the pitches in Brazil.

The 28-year-old was seen enjoying a post-season break with his wife Lorelei Taron and their daughter Dominique Garcia.

Hitting the beach: Falcao's knee injury in January meant he would be on the Miami beaches rather than the Brazil pitches

The former Atletico Madrid hitman suffered a knee injury back in January which he ultimately couldn't recover from fully to be fit for Brazil 2014.

Having scored nine goals in 17 appearances for Monaco last term, many were looking towards Falcao as a key component for Colombia in their quest for glory at the World Cup.

But despite the loss of the striker, the South American side have begun the competition in fine style, opening up with two group stage wins against Greece and Ivory Coast.Â
