Up for the Cup: Sportsmail's Laura Williamson will lead this week's Football Friday Hangout

MailOnline Sport's series of Football Friday Google+ Hangouts continues with Laura Williamson leading the discussion ahead of the final weekend of Barclays Premier League fixtures.

Laura, Sportsmail's athletics correspondent and London football reporter, is ideally placed to lift the lid on the race for the Champions League.

And most mouth-wateringly, the prospect of an unprecedented play-off for third place and automatic qualification for Europe's premier competition.

MailOnline Sport has revealed that 
Arsenal and Chelsea face the prospect of ending the season level on 
points and goal difference - meaning there would be a one-off play-off 
to decide who finishes third in the Premier League.

Arsenal's 4-1 win over Wigan at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night means 
that Arsene Wenger's side moved on to 70 points and goal difference of 34 with 
goals scored at 71 for the season. On Sunday the Gunners travel to Newcastle, who have nothing to play for.

This means that if Chelsea were to 
draw with Everton at Stamford Bridge on the final day and Arsenal beat Newcastle by one goal and also concede at least one -
 so 2-1, 3-2, 4-3 etc - then they will be all square.

With third place in the Premier 
League qualifying for the group stages of the Champions League rather 
than having to go through a qualifier, it means finishing third is a big
 advantage.

Sportsmail understands that the Premier League are preparing for the possibility of a play-off, should it come to that.

The possibility of an end of season play-off has been planned for in the past, back in the 1995-96 season when Manchester United and Newcastle United were fighting it out for the title. Despite being neck and neck for much of the  run-in, United won the league without the need for a play-off.

It is understood that if there is a play-off then it would be as soon after the end of season as possible and while there is no location set for an eventual play-off, it is almost certain to be in London.

The problem for the Premier League would be when to play such a match - Chelsea have an end-of-season tour to the USA to play friendlies against Manchester City next week, and then there are England friendlies on May 29 against the Republic of Ireland and then in Brazil on June 2.

But it is understood the Premier League would want it to be played as soon as possible as neither club would want the season to stretch into June but the play-off regulation is part of PL rules.

Tottenham can still gatecrash the Champions League party and pip Arsenal to fourth.
