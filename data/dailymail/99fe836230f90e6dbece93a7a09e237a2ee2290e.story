Going up: Royal Mail is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first-class stamps

The price of a first-class stamp will leap by a third to 60p next month.

The 14p rise was announced by Royal Mail on the very day it was handed the power to set its own stamp prices for the first time in its 172-year history.

A second-class stamp, currently 36p, will jump to 50p, a rise of 39 per cent. By comparison, most workers pay is either frozen or rising at less than 2 per cent a year.

Royal Mail will be able to continue to raise its prices as often – and by as much – as it likes after postal regulator Ofcom did away with current price controls.

The only protection, which will last for just seven years, is a ‘safeguard cap’ on the price of a second-class stamp, large second-class letters and small packages weighing up to 2kg. Ofcom said Royal Mail cannot charge more than 55p for a second class stamp this year.

This ‘cap’ will be increased with the cost of living each year until 2020.

The latest price rises, which will come into effect on April 30 were widely criticised yesterday.

The increases in the price of stamps followed a decision by regulator Ofcom to give Royal Mail the freedom to set its own prices

Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘Effectively, this is a licence for Royal Mail to print money.’ He warned that a first-class stamp ‘without limit’ will simply become ‘unaffordable’ for many customers, such as small firms.

The details of other safeguards have not been decided, and will not come into effect until April 2013. When the seven-year safeguard ends, there will be no caps on any of Royal Mail’s services unless Ofcom decides another cap is necessary.

Royal Mail boss Moya Greene yesterday insisted she had ‘no option’ but to increase prices to protect the crucial ‘universal service obligation’. This is the promise to collect and deliver letters six days a week, and allow people to send a letter for the same price anywhere from the Cornish coast to the Scottish islands.

Ofcom’s 251-page report, published yesterday, acknowledged the ‘critical role in the cohesion of society’ played by this ‘fundamentally important’ service. Miss Greene refused to rule out the prospect of multiple price rises each year

Robert Hammond, director of postal policy at Consumer Focus, warned of ‘a fine line between being willing to pay more and deciding to walk away from using the postal service’.

Stuart McIntosh, of Ofcom, said Royal Mail has been hit by people being more likely to send an email, a text message, a Tweet and so on, than to post a letter. He said: ‘If you are thinking about communicating with somebody... the last thing you are going to do is to sit down and write them a letter.’

The Greeting Card Association said Britons send more cards than anybody else in the world. A typical adult sends 31 each year. The scale of other price rises is high. For example, the cost of a one-month ‘redirection’ service, if you move house, will jump from £8 to £12.50, a 56 per cent increase.

The Communication Workers’ Union said the price rises were the latest ploy to prepare the company for privatisation next year.

Last week, the firm’s pension fund was handed to taxpayers, leaving them to pay £37.5billion of ‘pension promises’ to its workers, but handing over assets of only £28billion.

A Department for Business spokesman said: ‘Price rises are never welcome, but ministers are clear that the top priority is to protect the universal service on which people rely.’
