Kevin Wright, 49, is accused of stealing £250,000 from cancer charities he set up including one for his won son

A father stole hundreds of thousands of pounds from cancer charities - including one he set up to help his own son, a court heard.

Kevin Wright, 49, set up countless charities which raised over £2 million but at least £250,000 of this was paid directly into his personal bank account, it was said.

One of the funds was set up to help his son Bobby, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three in 2005, but he did not receive the treatment intended and instead Wright took his family on a £60,000 trip to Disneyland.

Wright believed that he had 'carte Blanche to spend the money as he liked' and hundreds of thousands of pounds is still unaccounted for, the jury was told.

He denies eight counts of fraud, 11 of theft and one count of converting criminal property at Nottingham Crown Court. His wife Jacqueline Wright also denies a count of converting criminal property.

Nicholas Johnson QC said Wright exerted such a hold over his victims that they would even refuse NHS treatment at his request.

'He manipulated people, using their fears and sympathy, he was arrogant and calculating, taking great steps to cover his tracks,' he told the court.

'Some of the money may have gone to help poorly children, but some of the fundraising went straight into their personal accounts.

'Some was withdrawn [from the funds] in cash, as much as £50,000 in a single month was withdrawn, with no accounts to show where it went.'

The jury of five men and seven women heard that Wright had approached parents of other sick children offering to help pay for their treatment at the private Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) in New York.

Mr Johnson said: 'But this was a hook, a way of getting people to part with their money.

'They sold lottery tickets, they called chances, had collection boxes and allowed donations from their website.

'In Mid December 2006 they made a deposit of $349,000 to the MSKCC, they had raised around $470,000.

'But he demanded a refund, receiving £166,000 in March 2007 and another £67,000 in April.

'Between July and August 2006 the fund paid for a trip to the Bahamas, while they were there they went to Disneyland in America.

'It cost about £60,000, he claimed this was for intensive treatment each day for five hours for six weeks.

'The crown say this was another abuse of a position of trust.

'Mr
 Wright did provide some care to poorly children, but around £380,000 of
 funds were deposited in his and his wife’s personal accounts between 
April 2005 and March 2008.

'Around £250,000 of that came directly from the appeal funds.'

But despite raising over £2million none of the children ever underwent treatment at the world-famous centre, the court heard.

While raising money for Bobby’s Fund he was donated £30,000 each from two major charities, the Janet Nash fund and Caldwell Children, with the agreement that should the treatment not take place the money must be returned.

Money continued to pour into the funds set up for Bobby until 2009 - two years after the Wrights had decided not to use the MSKCC treatment.

Instead Wright splashed the £60,000 on a trip to the Bahamas and Disneyland, claiming that his son had undergone 'intensive' treatment every day of the trip.

Around £500,000 worth of receipts and invoices were found at the family home in Tamworth, including around £38,000 which was released to spend on Wright’s restaurant, the Toad In The Hole, the court was told.

Another £30,000 was spent on renovating a pub owned by Mr Wright’s girlfriend, £20,000 went to a friend who ran a used business, £4,000 was spent on cigarettes and alcohol and £33,000 on vehicle related expenses, it was said. Cash expenses totalled over £90,000.

Around £700,000 was raised to help a boy
 called Callum Kaye, who was born in 2002, but he only received 
'minimal' expenditure totalling around £13,000, the jury was told.

His family even flew for an appointment at MSKCC in New York but when they got there the clinic knew nothing about their arrival.

Mr Johnson said: 'His [Callum’s] mother Anne Marie described Mr Wright as ‘slick’, he talked to them about alternative therapies such as eating organic food.

'He told her he was a millionaire and could help her to get Callum treatment.

'They signed an agreement to raise funds for treatment, the fundraising would claim they were raising funds for treatment MSKCC even if they didn’t as it was the best way to raise money.

'But Mr Wright refused to tell Anne Marie how much money had been raised, he made sure she remained isolated, told them not to come to fundraisers.

'He was controlling, when she asked about the money he told her Callum would probably be in the ground if it wasn’t for him.

'Around £700,000 was raised for Callum’s Fund in total. But what happened to that £700,000?'

Police began investigating when Wright refused to tell Callum’s mother her how much money there was in the fund.

Wright’s son Bobby has since recovered from cancer. The trial continues.
