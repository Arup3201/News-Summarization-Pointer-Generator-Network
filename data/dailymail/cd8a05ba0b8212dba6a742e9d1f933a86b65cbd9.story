A British bomb-maker who was on the run with the world's most wanted woman - dubbed the 'White Widow' - has been executed in a gun battle in Somalia alongside an American fellow terrorist.

Habib Ghani had been in hiding with the widow of a London 7/7 bomber, Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, in a remote part of the war-torn country when his killers struck, according to reports.

The 28-year-old and Omar Hammami, 29, from Alabama - known for jihadi rap videos he posted to YouTube - are thought to have fallen out with commanders from militant group al-Shabab, provoking a bloody revenge.

Ghani, from Hounslow, west London, and 
Hammami, also called al-Amriki (The American), are thought to have been together when their former comrades from al-Shabab cornered them.

The gunmen overpowered their bodyguards in a 
village where they had been in hiding since fleeing the terror group in 
June.

Ghani, who also called himself Osama 
al-Britani, was a key ally of Muslim convert Lewthwaite, who was married
to King’s Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay.

The so-called ‘White Widow’, who is the world’s most wanted woman, has been on the run in East Africa after police foiled a Christmas bomb plot against Western tourists in the coastal resort of Mombasa in 2011.

Police believe the soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, had been working with Ghani for several years, although she was not thought to have been present when gunmen struck early yesterday.

American jihadist Omar Hammami has been killed. In April, he tweeted

as he was in a tea shop

Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school

Residents in al-Baate village in southern Somalia said their bodies were dragged away by rebels.

‘This morning al-Amriki and his comrades were attacked by well-armed fighters,’ said Hussein Nur.

‘After a brief fight, al-Amriki and his two colleagues were killed. Several of their guards escaped.’

The al-Shabab gunmen struck at 5.30am, just after morning prayers, capturing the jihadists unawares.

Sources said the gunmen had lain in wait for several days, posing as camel herders.

Ghani and Hammami were allies of Somali Islamist Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who split from al-Shabab in June, causing a rift in the group’s ranks.

Since the split, al-Shabab has been hunting down and killing allies of Aweys.

Al-Amriki - the son of a Christian mother and a Syrian-born Muslim father - was on the FBI’s Most 
Wanted terror list and a $5million (£3.1million) bounty was offered for 
information leading to his capture.

He had been active on Twitter but his last post was on September 5 in which he said: 'I'm still a terrorist.'

A
more prophetic Tweet came in April in which he said: 'May not find 
another chance to tweet but just remember what we said and what we stood
for. God kept me alive to deliver the mssg 2 the umah'.

Reports of Hammami's death crop up every few months in Somalia, only for him to resurface alive and well a short while later.

But
a U.S. terrorism expert who closely follows the inner workings of 
Somalia's al-Qaida-linked terror group says he thinks that the current 
reports of the death are accurate.

'I think it's very likely true based on the sources I am seeing,' said J.M. Berger, who runs the website Intelwire.com.

Ghani
was born in the UK to a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother. According
to police sources, he left his home in Hounslow several years ago and 
gained bomb-making experience in Pakistan.

Last night details emerged about Ghani’s secret life in Somalia where he was also known locally as Sheikh Towfiq.

Wanted: He ascended the ranks of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab high enough to attract a $5 million U.S. government bounty. This FBI listing shows their description of Hammami

The bearded Briton was living with his Somalian wife Habibo and two children, a boy aged three and a baby girl just a few months old, in the remote town of Hawalbarbar which has no electricity.

He owned a small kiosk, where he charged phone batteries with his solar-powered adapter for a fee.

Ghani and Lewthwaite were said to have fled Kenya in December 2011 as police swooped on a third and unconnected British extremist, Jermaine Grant, who was living on the other side of Mombasa.

Police feared she and Ghani were planning to unleash a terror attack as the tourist season got under way but she managed to slip the net.

Lewthwaite is believed to be a vital conduit between Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan and East Africa.

The mother of four converted to Islam at the age of 17 and married Lindsay in 2002 after meeting him on the internet.

She was seven months pregnant when Lindsay, a Jamaican convert from Huddersfield, killed 26 people when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005.

Since her disappearance, Lewthwaite has been linked to a spate of grenade attacks in Mombasa, including one which killed three people.

Ghani’s family, who live in a modest £270,000 terraced house in a quiet suburban street, refused to speak to reporters last night.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Somalia and are looking into this.’

Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run for nearly two years.

Lewthwaite is suspected of funding 
terrorist groups in Kenya and was questioned by police in December 2011,
but she managed to slip away and has been on the run ever since.

The mother-of-three was pregnant with Jermaine Lindsay's baby when he blew himself up on a tube at Kings Cross, killing 26 people.

Fifty two people were killed and more than 700 were injured when four suicide bombers struck in London during the morning of July 7, 2005.

Mohammad Sidique Khan killed seven people including himself on a train heading towards Paddington from Edgware Road.

Shehzad Tanweer detonated a bomb aboard a train between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate tube station, killing seven.

And Hasib Hussain detonated his bomb on the top deck of a bus in Tavistock Square killing 13 people.
