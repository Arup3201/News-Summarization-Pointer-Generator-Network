Manchester United winger Angel di Maria's stunning lob against Leicester was all in vain as the Red Devils lost 5-3 against the Foxes, but despite this have we already seen the goal of the season?

The Argentine's sumptuous lob midway during the first half put United 2-0 up as they seemingly looked like cruising to victory, with the former Real Madrid winger impressing for Louis van Gaal's side throughout proceedings.

After picking up the ball just past the halfway line the 26-year-old linked up well with United captain Wayne Rooney, who in turn laid the ball back to Di Maria before he took matters into his own hands.

Di Maria got the ball on to his left foot before advancing with the ball and then drifting into the penalty area.

He then masterfully lobbed the ball over an exposed  Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal to stun the crowd and opposition players alike.

Di Maria is no stranger to goals like this scoring an equally impressive goal for Argentina in an emphatic friendly win over World Cup winners Germany earlier this month.

Di Maria is one of only two players to score a direct free-kick this season, scoring with a 35-yard free-kick on his home debut for United in the 4-0 win over QPR last Sunday, with Niko Kranjcar also scoring an impressive free-kick for the latter in a 2-2 draw with Stoke on Saturday.

Despite the attacking brilliance of United, particularly in the first half, Di Maria and his team-mates left empty handed from the King Power Stadium after surrendering a 3-1 lead to lose 5-3 to Nigel Pearson's side.

As a result Leicester moved into sixth place in the Premier League, while United remain firmly poised in mid-table with five points from their opening five games.
