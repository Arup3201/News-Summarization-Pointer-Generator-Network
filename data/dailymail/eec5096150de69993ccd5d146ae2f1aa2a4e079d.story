A drugs gang tried to smuggle £16million of cocaine into Scotland using a James Bond-style underwater craft, a court was told yesterday.

The plot involved an ‘enormous’ amount of high-purity cocaine stashed in the hull of a Colombian ship off the North Ayrshire coast.

Prosecutors say Dutch smugglers planned to use diving gear and a high-speed submarine vehicle to sneak in a haul so massive it could have affected the entire UK drugs market.

At Leeds Crown Court, barrister Paul Mitchell was opening the case against four Dutch nationals charged with conspiring to import 238lb of the Class A drug into the UK through Hunterston, south of Largs. 

Mr Mitchell told the jury that Henri van Doesburg, 68, his son Roderick, 23, grandson Darryl-Jay, 22, and Arnold van Milt, 49, were all involved in the alleged conspiracy.

Mr Mitchell said the three younger men obtained sophisticated underwater equipment with the intention of removing the drugs stashed in the rudder housing of the motor vessel Cape Maria, moored in the Clyde, and bringing it ashore.

But the cocaine haul was discovered by investigators before the men could get their hands on it, the prosecutor said.

A police search of a car and an inflatable boat uncovered specialised dry diving suits and ‘equipment you might have seen used by James Bond and his adversaries that you would use if you wanted to travel underwater at high speed,’ Mr Mitchell told the jury. 

It is understood the men had a Seabob submersible, a motorised vehicle designed to allow a diver to travel considerable distances.

Mr Mitchell said the cocaine would have been accessible in a submerged recess in the ship’s hull from outside the boat to someone with access to scuba-diving equipment.

The court was told the four defendants travelled from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, first stopping in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, before continuing on their journey to Scotland. 

While in England, said Mr Mitchell, the defendants based themselves at a campsite and took various trips on a rubber dinghy boat around the Lincolnshire shores.

Roderick and Darryl-Jay van Doesburg then left Cleethorpes on May 5 and drove with van Milt to Scotland in a black Ford Explorer they had purchased under the name Ray Monty, Mr Mitchell said.

The jury heard Henri van Doesburg then flew back to Holland where he was later arrested after searches on a computer at his address found ‘significant’ links between the four and the vessel importing the drugs.

Mr Mitchell said: ‘At 9pm that evening, the three defendants checked into Brisbane House Hotel in Largs, close to the mooring place of the Cape Maria. They enquired about hiring diving equipment for three men.

‘The Cape Maria, having travelled from Colombia, was at Hunterston with the drugs stored in the back.

‘Officers searched the rudder trunk space, also accessible from the outside, where they found five large black packages containing 55 smaller packages containing cocaine as high as 80 per cent purity.’

Mr Mitchell added: ‘The street value of this cocaine was £16.2million. These are extraordinary profits. This is an enormous amount of the drug which would have had a significant effect on the drugs market in the country as a whole.’

The trio were arrested on May 9 at the four-star Hydro hotel in Seamill near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, where the Cape Maria was docked.

Mr Mitchell added: ‘The three defendants each had diving equipment, and van Milt’s telephone had a document clearly relating to the Cape Maria, the boat with the drugs in.’

The drugs were found in the rudder area of Cape Maria which had sailed from Colombia to Hunterston

Henri van Doesburg was arrested the next day in the Netherlands for his alleged part in the plot between February and May this year.

Mr Mitchell added: ‘A Customs officer happened to be staying at the hotel. He happened to notice the men and the inflatable boat outside the hotel.

‘That same afternoon that police found the drugs, the defendants were still around in the area.

‘Is it all just a coincidence? The Crown say that it isn’t. These are the men who were behind the attempt to import the drugs.’

All four men deny conspiracy to evade the prohibition on the importation of controlled drugs. The trial continues.
