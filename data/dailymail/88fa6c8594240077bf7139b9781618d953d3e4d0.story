Perhaps it's her penchant for cavorting in a bikini on mega yachts during her holidays, or the potential for fantastic karaoke evenings.

Whatever the reason, Britons have named Beyonce as the celebrity they'd most like to travel with, according to a new survey.

The singer topped the fantasy travel partner wishlist compiled by holiday comparison site Icelolly, with 21 per cent of those polled choosing her above other celebrities.

Fantasy travel partner: Britons has named Beyonce as the celebrity they'd most like to holiday with

Get the party started: DJ hitmaker Calvin Harris and popstar Rihanna were the second and third most popular fantasy travel partner, respectively, according to the survey by Icelolly

Just last week, the Single Ladies star shared her latest holiday snaps with fans - featuring mega yachts, picture perfect beaches and plenty of skimpy bikinis - so it's not hard to see why she was chosen as the ideal travel companion.

Beyonce beat out other popstars including Rihanna (15 per cent), Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (12 per cent) and Lady Gaga (five per cent).

DJ Calvin Harris was the second favourite with 17 per cent of the vote, eclipsing Brad Pitt and Harry Styles (seven per cent each). Despite being less of a household name, Harris' ability to throw the best party is undisputed, thanks to the number of hits under his belt. 

1. Beyoncé – 21%

2. Calvin Harris – 17%

3. Rihanna – 15%

4. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini – 12%

5. Keith Lemon – 8%

6. Harry Styles – 7%

- Brad Pitt – 7%

7. Lady Gaga – 5%

8. David Guetta – 4%

- Robbie Williams – 4%

1. Justin Bieber – 37%

2. Katie Price – 15%

3. Piers Morgan – 12%

- Nick Clegg – 12%

4. Miley Cyrus – 8%

5. Joey Essex – 6%

6. Katie Hopkins – 3%

- Russell Brand – 3%

7. Simon Cowell – 2%

- Kim Kardashian– 2%

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Justin Bieber was named as the celebrity holiday partner from hell. 

His recent restaurant bust-up with Orlando Bloom in Ibiza and brushes with the law earned 37 per cent of the vote for worst travel partner.

Katie Price (15 per cent), Piers Morgan and Nick Clegg (12 per cent each), and Miley Cyrus (eight per cent) feature on the unflattering list.

Not surprising: Justin Bieber is considered the holiday partner from hell

Unpopular: Katie Price (15%) and Piers Morgan 12%) both scored highly on the 'worst travel partner' survey

Suniel Makh, Brand Director at Icelolly, said: 'Celebrities obviously lead a very lavish lifestyle which we all dream of emulating whilst on holiday – attempting to escape reality in the pursuit of relaxation and that all-important star treatment.

'However, it seems money isn't always everything and Brits still very much value the experience and memories that a decent travel partner can provide. 

'And let's face it…a break away with Bieber could very well result in trouble and unnecessary stress!'
