To some, David Cameron’s presence at a party at Rebekah Brooks’ home last Christmas suggested power broking among the ‘Chipping Norton Set’.

But according to fellow guest Jeremy Clarkson, the meatiest matter discussed by the Prime Minister and the former New International chief executive was sausage rolls.

The Top Gear presenter's revelations reveal the Prime Minister's close social ties with Mrs Brooks - which Mr Clarkson revealed extended to country walks, tennis matches and picnics.

Jeremy Clarkson has lifted the lid on the infamous gathering

Lifting the lid on the now infamous 
gathering on Thursday, December 23 last year, Mr Clarkson wrote in his 
Sunday Times column: ‘What Rebekah and Cameron talked about most of all…
is sausage rolls.

‘We were planning a big walk with all our kids over Christmas and thought it might be a good idea to build a fire in my woods and stop off for a picnic. Rebekah was worried about what we’d eat. Cameron thought sausage rolls would be nice. My wife said she’d get some.’

The party is infamous because it took place days after Mr Cameron stripped Business Secretary Vince Cable, an avowed enemy of Rupert Murdoch, of his power to decide on Mr Murdoch’s attempt to take full control of BSkyB.

News Corp, which owns 39 per cent of 
BSkyB, wanted to buy the remaining 61 per cent for £7.8billion but Mr 
Cameron decided the role should be passed to Jeremy Hunt, the 
Conservative Culture Secretary.

Rupert Murdoch’ s son James was also a guest as was Samantha Cameron.

Clarkson, who attended the festive gathering with wife Francie, had the answer for anyone wondering if "evil James Murdoch" was "to be found sticking pins into a waxwork model" of Mr Cable.

‘No, actually. James was sitting opposite me and we spent most of the night arguing about the environment,’ the Top Gear presenter said. ‘He likes it and I don’t.’

Mr Clarkson added that the party was 
just like "a million other Christmas-time dinners being held in a 
million other houses all over the world."

And joking that Rupert Murdoch joined the gathering "on a live video feed from his private volcano stroking a cat", he said phone hacking and BSkyB was not discussed - nor was it discussed when the three met next for a tennis match.

Mr Cameron's meetings with Mrs Brooks and the Murdoch family are now under scrutiny.

The Cabinet Office revealed on Friday
the Prime Minister has met Rupert Murdoch's executives on 26 occasions 
in just over a year since he took office in May last year.

Brooks shares her home there with her second husband, Old Etonian Charlie Brooks. They met over supper at Clarkson’s house. 

Clarkson said that the Brooks are the 'most fantastically kind and generous' people he knows.

Countryside: Jeremy Clarkson's Chipping Norton home where the Brookses first met

The ‘Chipping Norton Set’ is the nickname given to the powerful political and media figures who have homes near the Oxfordshire town and socialise together.

Within just a few miles are the constituency home of David Cameron in Dean, Oxfordshire, Rebekah Brooks in Churhill, just down the road, and Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her PR tycoon husband Matthew Freud, who live at the £6m Burford Priory.  

Near Chipping Norton is Jeremy Clarkson's sprawling country pile, and moving slightly west at Kingham are the Bamfords, the JCB millionaires and owners of Daylesford farm shop.

Blur bassist, Alex James, also lives nearby, as does Ruby Wax and Kate Moss.

Carphone Warehouse co-founder Charlie Dunstone is a stones throw away too.

Entrepreneur Nick Jones, married to Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young, last year paid £4 million for a nine-bedroom 17th-century pile in Oxfordshire.

He adds that he felt 'desperately sad' that she had to resign - but said it almost meant he may see her more.

Clarkson also poked fun at the notion of ‘amoral’ or ‘corrupt’ behaviour among his friends, adding: ‘There is a group of Chipping Norton people who do live close to one another and who do meet up most weekends for wine and cheesy things on sticks. I am one of these people. And so is the Blur bassist Alex James, who often brings his children round to swim in our pool.’

Clarkson's revelations comes hours after it revealed that Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth 
and her PR tycoon husband Matthew Freud threw a party for the set hours before the he news broke that murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's 
mobile had been hacked.

Mr Cameron also invited his former press chief and News of the World editor Andy Coulson to Chequers, his official residence in April - three months after he resigned from his position.

Downing Street has confirmed the Christmas gathering took place on Thursday, December 23 last year.

Labour MP Chris Bryant vowed to ask questions in Parliament to find out what was discussed over the informal dinner.
