This picture shows the aftermath of a drink-driver who ploughed into the side of a police car and narrowly missed two officers while they were out on patrol.

The two policemen had a lucky escape when a Volkswagen Golf crashed into their car in Dudley, West Midlands in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The car was hit with such force the doors were wrenched off.

Amazingly, one policeman managed to limp from the wreckage to arrest the suspect.

A drink-driver smashed in this police car, causing both doors to be wrenched off. One officer was trapped inside the vehicle but the other managed to escape and arrest the 44-year-old male driver

The second policeman was trapped in the passenger seat at the scene  - but was later freed with the help of firefighters.

Both officers were taken to hospital for treatment but neither man's injuries are believed to be serious.

West Midlands Police confirmed the 44-year-old driver of the other vehicle was held on suspicion of drink driving.

The suspect, from Dudley, has since been released on police bail pending further enquires.

The force has also released a picture showing the mangled wreckage of the squad car in the aftermath of the crash - which happened at around 2.40am.

Today, Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, West Midland Police's force incident manager, said: 'Both officers were extremely lucky not to suffer more serious injuries.

'They were on a routine patrol when the collision happened. The driver of the other car had lost control of his vehicle and the end result could have been far worse.

'I want to remind everyone to think carefully before getting behind the wheel this weekend - there is absolutely no excuse for driving while drunk.

'If you're planning a night out over the bank holiday weekend think about how you're going to get back and leave your car at home.'
