The appointment of crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep Richard Scudamore in a job demonstrates how seriously the Premier League are taking the chief executive’s sexist emails scandal.

Milltown Partners, who specialise in discreet reputational work for high-end clients, was founded by Paddy Harverson, former Royal spin doctor, and ex-Google executive DJ Collins. And BBC sports editor David Bond is set to join.

The choice of Milltown also highlights the cosy governance set-up at the Premier League, which has to be reformed even if Scudamore stays in office. All-powerful Scudamore’s effective line managers are the PL’s audit and remuneration committee, who decide his bonus and salary.

Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore

Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman

And that group is chaired by Scudamore’s close friend and shooting partner Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea. And Chelsea happen to be another client of Milltown. As a result, there are growing concerns as to whether Buck should remain chairman of the A and R group.

The PL strongly defend their ridiculous two-strong board of Scudamore and interim  chairman Peter McCormick, whose Harrogate firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the PL.

The PL claim the 20 clubs, who meet at least six times a year, are the directors of the company. But their one-eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes.

Sofa time: Steven Gerrard will pause his World Cup preparations to work with ITV for the Champions League final

England captain Steven Gerrard will be a guest pundit with ITV for the Champions League final. Gerrard will now be spending a fortnight in Portugal. He is on holiday this week, followed by training with England at Vale do Lobo before the final in Lisbon.

PREMIER LEAGUE sponsors Barclays, who have reportedly voiced upset over Scudamore’s sexist emails, are to change PR agencies. It is widely expected that Barclays will not renew their current three-year deal with the top flight, but they will hire Havas and instruct them to do a root-and-branch look into how much value the £40m-a-year PL backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost-cutting exercise.

THE highly prestigious Footballer of the Year function was relegated to a cramped basement room at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel because of a switch of dates.

The main reception suite, instead of being adorned with evocative pictures of every winner of the Football Writers Association award, was booked by the British Sandwich Industry. And rather than Luis Suarez being honoured in the big room, it was a BBQ chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt.

Ian’s priorities wrong

It will not please followers of rugby league giants Wigan Warriors that their chairman Ian Lenagan has chosen to go to the FA Cup final rather than his club’s Super League Magic Weekend clash with Leeds at the Etihad Stadium.

Lenagan is also chairman of League Two  football team Oxford United and an FA councillor. He was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of Hull City owner Assem Allam being allowed to change the name of the club to Hull Tigers which the FA voted to reject.

Meanwhile, it’s understood the astonishing decision for the Hull KR v Hull Super League fixture to be staged in Manchester at the same time as Hull City take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley wasn’t opposed by Hull rugby league club owner Adam Pearson.

He used to be head of operations at the football club, but had an acrimonious exit following Allam’s takeover.

Shock: Rugby League owner Adam Pearson didn't oppose the Hull sports clashes this Saturday

Matthew Syed might have been discarded by Joey Barton as ghost writer for his upcoming autobiography but the Times sports columnist has emerged as front runner to be the next BBC Sports Editor. However, there appears to be a split of opinion on the selection panel as to whether the Beeb want a talking head like Syed or a big story getter to replace the departing David Bond.

The England Cricket Board are to lose their highly successful commercial chief John Perera, who has remarkably brought in more than £750m worth of sponsorship and TV rights during nearly a decade dominated by a financial recession. Perera will be leaving in 2016, giving the ECB two years notice to find a successor.
