There was nothing more mind-numbingly maddening in the aftermath of England’s worst World Cup exit yet than the immediate reaction of Peter Moores.

‘We thought 275 was chaseable. We’ll have to look at the data,’ said a coach now fighting to avoid his second ignominious exit from international cricket as the reality of an embarrassing group stage elimination sank in.

Well, England should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one-day cricket and start again.

90 - the amount of runs captain Eoin Morgan scored in five innings at the World Cup

12.2 - the overs it took for New Zealand to beat England's total of 123 in their second group game.

111 - Australia's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament

654 - total of runs scored by Australia and Sri Lanka against England

1 - number of centuries scored by an England batsman against Test playing nations

72 - number of runs scored by Sri Lanka off the bowling of Chris Woakes

0 - number of wins registered by England over Test playing nations in the tournament

0 - the number of centuries scored by a Bangladesh batsman in a World Cup before playing England on Monday.

37.4-1-234-5 - Chris Woakes's tournament bowling figures.

49 - the amount of runs Steven Finn went for in two overs against New Zealand.

You do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and, after this 15-run defeat by Bangladesh, are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world.

The only statistic Moores needs to know is that England, having been thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, were humbled by a Bangladesh side who beat them here at their own very English game.

The key data is that England, having defeated just Scotland so far, have excelled themselves in being even worse at this World Cup than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in Australia.

And this humiliation has come after the Ashes were moved and a winter of one-day cricket provided to try to make sure England had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50-over trophy that looks further away than ever.

In truth, arranging a one-day series against Sri Lanka before Christmas was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because England are light years away from the dynamic, vibrant teams we have seen here.

To hurl all the blame in the direction of Moores would be unfair but there is no question that his position must now come under serious scrutiny, as too will that of the man who re-appointed him in Paul Downton.

Colin Graves does not become ECB chairman until May but he is not the sort of man to postpone a big decision and the coach and managing director may soon be caught up in the new broom that is sweeping through the English game.

'There was no obvious team to pick because they're young players, they haven't played a lot of cricket. We've got nine guys who haven't been to a World Cup before. 

'That's the reality of it. You make your choice, you pick the side you think is the best team, which we did, and we have to accept they didn't play well enough.' 

Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen were among those criticising England on Twitter after their early elimination in the group stages.

'England had the wrong team, the wrong style of play and everyone could see it. Tonight's result is not a shock, I feel for Morgan. Coach is in trouble,' Warne tweeted.

Pietersen added: 'I cannot believe this. I just cannot. But, well done Bangladesh! You deserved it!

'Do not say we haven't prioritised ODI cricket! We played a back-to-back Ashes to make sure England played six months of ODIs before this World Cup!' 

Gary Lineker, the former England striker, said: 'Bangladesh win! Congratulations to them. The good news is, England can't possibly get any worse.' 

And Piers Morgan wrote: 'What an absolute disgrace. [Paul] Downton and Moores have dragged English cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty, clueless incompetence.

'I want  Downton and Moores sacked today and Kevin Pietersen restored to the team. This farce just reached its true, hideous nadir.

'I wouldn't trust Downton and Moores to run a ****ing bath, let alone the England cricket team.'

To highlight Moores immediate mention of data on television is not to take a cheap shot at a decent man who appears to be liked and respected by players who on the whole have let him and their country down here.

By the time he gave a more considered press conference yesterday there was no mention of the statistics that seem to have weighed down even a free spirit in Eoin Morgan, who has been a huge disappointment as captain here.

My gut feeling is that Moores will be given the summer before England think about replacing him but a personal view is that maybe his assistant Paul Farbrace, an Asia Cup and World Twenty20 winner with Sri Lanka before throwing in his lot with England, could take extra responsibility for limited-overs cricket.

England are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests in 10 months and the danger is that one-day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of England’s list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken.

The overwhelming favourite to succeed Moores if and when he goes is Jason Gillespie but he distanced himself from the role yesterday and there is no doubt that the Yorkshire coach and his family are happy and settled in Leeds.

Gillespie has already turned down a role with his native Australia under Darren Lehmann and has been given permission by Yorkshire to coach a team, probably Adelaide, in next year’s Big Bash while staying at Headingley.

The constant year-round slog of international cricket is making it harder for countries to attract the best coaches and former Yorkshire chairman Graves may need to be at his most persuasive if he wants to recruit his old county coach.

Moores and Downton are not the only ones under the microscope. Morgan refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one-day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss England’s one-day international against Ireland in May, their first of another ‘new’ era, to play in the IPL.

Well, I am sorry but if he does want to continue then he needs to be with the team in his native Dublin, particularly as it will be impossible for England players touring West Indies next month to make the Ireland trip on May 8.

The sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for England to catch up in 50-over cricket is to build a new young team of one-day players as different as possible to that which will contest Test cricket in the next year against West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa.

Eoin Morgan looks to have been given the backing by Moores to continue as England's one-day captain

Ian Bell, who left England far too much to do against Bangladesh by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls, will surely bow out of one-day cricket after Friday’s dead rubber against Afghanistan while it is in the best interests of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for them to do the same.

Joe Root was strongly considered for the one-day captaincy by England when they sacked Alastair Cook before they plumped for the out-of-form Morgan and I would give him the one-day job now and build a new team around him.

It is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by Root and including Jos Buttler, who came so close to recuing England yesterday, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jason Roy, James Vince, Sam Billings and Adil Rashid growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one-day world. But the seam bowling remains a huge worry, not least the absence of a quick left-armer.

Bangladesh, worthy quarter-finalists now, had the fastest bowler on show yesterday in Rubel Hossain, who took four wickets, and that must be the first time they have ever had more pace at their disposal than England.

The lack of variety in England’s bowling is one of the many reasons why they will be on their way home before the business end of this elongated tournament. And why they will be returning to the drawing board when they get there in their never-ending search for one-day success.
