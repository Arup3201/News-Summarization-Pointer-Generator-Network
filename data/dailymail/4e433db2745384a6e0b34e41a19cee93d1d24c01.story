Anthony Weiner made yet another attempt to get his struggling campaign back on track last night - but his attempt to connect with voters was dominated by questions about his controversial spokeswoman Barbara Morgan.

The embattled candidate for mayor of New York City held a campaign event in his former constituency in Queens, where he answered questions from the audience but refused to talk to reporters.

The event was not attended by Ms Morgan - the first time she has not been seen by Weiner's side in days - prompting speculation that she may have even lost her job after describing a former campaign intern as a 'fame-hungry b****' and a 'sl**bag'.

Hasty retreat: The mayoral candidate climbed into a waiting SUV without answering reporters' questions

Her absence attracted calls of 'Where's Barbara?', but Mr Weiner shunned the press and did not answer the question, according to Buzzfeed.

The candidate's mayoral campaign ran into trouble last week when it was revealed that he had been sexting women for a year after the Twitter scandal which forced him to resign from Congress.

It took a turn for the worse on Tuesday when Ms Morgan responded to criticisms of the campaign made by former intern Olivia Nuzzi, calling her a 't***' and a 'c***'.

Mr Weiner attended an event organised by the Friends of Rockaway Beach with three other mayoral candidates on Wednesday night as he attempted to get past the controversy.

He answered three audience questions before saying, 'God bless you' and walking out of a side door.

Troubled: Mr Weiner at a campaign event in Queens last night, where he attempted to boost his chances of being elected mayor of New York City

The candidate was chased by 15 reporters - ignoring the event's other speakers - and ran into a waiting SUV.

Members of the press shouted out, 'Where's Barbara?', but did not get a response.

Some audience members at the event criticised the media circus surrounding Mr Weiner and expressed support for him, saying that he had proved his dedication to the city.

The 48-year-old was a popular congressman for Queens for more than 12 years, and had been tipped for higher office before he accidentally tweeted a photograph of his crotch which he had intended to send to a woman who was not his wife.

Initial polls in the Democratic primary election for mayor of New York showed Mr Weiner in a strong position against frontrunner Christine Quinn, but his support has collapsed since the revelation that he carried on sexting under the pseudonym 'Carlos Danger'.

Criticism: Ms Nuzzi, pictured, claimed that Mr Weiner's campaign was badly run and ineffective

Ms Morgan, the campaign's communications director, has not been seen in public since her expletive-laden tirade against Ms Nuzzi was published by Talking Points Memo on Tuesday.

Yesterday she took to Twitter to apologise, posting a photograph of a swear jar filled with bills and credit cards.

'Not my best day yesterday,' she wrote. 'Should've known better, been better. Gotta pay up.'

In a statement, she said: 'In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off-the-record conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologise.'

Ms Morgan was angry with Ms Nuzzi for posting an article in the New York Daily News suggesting that many of Mr Weiner's staff had only joined his campaign to get close to his wife, Hillary Clinton's adie Huma Abedin.

She also claimed that one employee had left because he had only been paid a third of what he was promised, and that the candidate incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica'.
