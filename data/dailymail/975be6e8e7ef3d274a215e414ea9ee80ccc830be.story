Last week, she joined the Pope to call for a solution to the problem of malnutrition and today, Queen Letizia was back in action, this time in an effort to get more people to volunteer.

The 42-year-old joined charity bosses for the State Volunteering Congress in Palma on the island of Mallorca, where she also presented a series of awards.

Attending the event is something of a tradition for the royal, who last year joined delegates in Pamplona while still plain Princess Letizia.

Tradition: Letizia also attended the State Volunteering Congress last year while she was still Princess Letizia

As at last year's event, which was held in Pamplona, she opted for a businesslike look and wore a neatly tailored grey dress teamed with her favourite £275 Hope Egg earrings by British brand, Links of London.

The annual conference is aimed at raising the profile of volunteers and about encouraging more people to sign up and help out with charity projects across Spain.

Letizia, who has built a reputation for championing charity causes since her marriage in 2004, is no stranger to volunteering herself and helps out on a Red Cross stand  on Spanish National Day.

In addition to the Red Cross, top causes for Letizia include poverty and children's issues, and she also works closely with the Spanish government on matters pertaining to disability.

She is also a champion of Spanish culture and, last month, travelled to Austrian capital Vienna to launch an exhibition dedicated to 17th century painter, Diego Velázquez. 

Favourites: Along with volunteering, Letizia also champions children's charities and the disabled

Culture: The royal is also a supporter of the arts and culture, and travelled to Vienna for a launch last month

Stylish: Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming Queen in June this year

During the launch, Letizia, who has worked hard to master English and French since marrying Felipe, made a brief speech in German before continuing in English.

The Spanish royals have had a busy few months since taking the top job in June and this week has proved no exception, with both Letizia and Felipe appearing at a number of events.

Among them was a reception held to mark the 75th anniversary of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid. 

The  couple were joined at the event by the Spanish minister of the Economy and Finance, Luis de Guindos, who stopped for a chat in the auditorium before the event began.

The Spanish National Research Council, where the couple made their appearance, is the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third largest in Europe.

The institute's aim is to develop and promote research and encourage scientific and technological progress. 

It also manages an extensive network of specialist libraries and has research centres spread around the country.

Unusually, however, neither half of the royal couple has ventured outside of Spain - instead confining themselves to touring their native country. 

Since June, the couple have visited France, Morocco and the Netherlands as well as their most recent trip - a tour of Luxembourg and Belgium two weeks ago.
