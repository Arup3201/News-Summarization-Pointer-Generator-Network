Tasty treat: The FDA said it did not know how many jars had been recalled by Hain Celestial Group

A number of peanut butter and almond butter products have been recalled over fears of a possible salmonella contamination.

Hain Celestial Group Inc admitted today that there have been reports of four illnesses that may be related to the nut butters. 

The affected products were sold under the brand names Arrowhead Mills peanut butters and MaraNatha almond butters and peanut butters. 

Also being recalled were some lots of private-label almond butter from grocers Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Kroger and Safeway.

A total of 45 production lots are affected.

They were sold in the US, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. 

NSpired Natural Foods Inc, a subsidiary of Hain Celestial, voluntarily recalled the products after routine testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found the problem.

The FDA said it did not know how many jars of nut butters were recalled. 

The company would not comment.

Typical symptoms of salmonella infection are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. 

These symptoms generally develop within one to three days of exposure to the bacterium and may last for up to a week. 

While anyone can become ill from exposure to salmonella, health officials say the risk of infection is particularly high for children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.

While salmonella contamination is usually associated with eggs and poultry, outbreaks have been linked to peanut butter in the past. 

Most recently, in 2012, peanut butter processor Sunland Inc was linked to an outbreak that spread across 20 US states and affected 35 people.

In 2008/09 more than 700 people were affected by an outbreak linked to infected peanuts, while more than 500 have fallen ill over the last year and a half in an outbreak linked to Foster Farms chicken.
