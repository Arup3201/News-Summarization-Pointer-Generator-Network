The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said.

Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne.

According to witnesses the party had been held to celebrate several birthdays of former participants in the Iron Dog snowmobile race, including Todd Palin.

Several members of the Palin family, having arrived in a stretch Hummer limousine, allegedly stepped in when it was discovered that an former boyfriend of middle-daughter Willow, 20, was at the party.

Oldest son Track, 25, is said to have ripped his shirt off while making rude gestures to the young man, while his sister, and Dancing With The Stars alumni, Bristol, 23, attacked the host.

'The owner of the house gets involved, and he probably wished he hadn’t. At this point, he’s up against nearly the whole Palin tribe: Palin women screaming. Palin men thumping their chests,' Amanda Coyne wrote.

'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly, and it’s something to hear when Sarah screams, “Don’t you know who I am!” '

'As people were leaving in a cab, Track was seen on the street, shirtless, flipping people off, with Sarah right behind him, and Todd somewhere in the foreground, tending to his bloody nose.'

Anchorage police were called to the scene just before midnight, but no arrests were made.

‘Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,’ police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News.

‘A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence.

‘At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made.

‘Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.’
