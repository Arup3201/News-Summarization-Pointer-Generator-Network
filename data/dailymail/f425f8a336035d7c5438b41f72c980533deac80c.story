A tech-savvy high school student from New York has been arrested for allegedly hacking into a computer system to improve his exam scores. 

Eric Walstrom, a 16-year-old junior at New Dorp HS in Staten Island, cracked software security and set up a network so he could access data remotely from his cell phone, according to The New York Post.

Between December 14 and February 9, the teenager reportedly changed the grades on his report cards and transcripts.

Walstrom was apparently caught out when a school IT worker noticed an unauthorized log-in had been used.

Police were notified and the student was allegedly charged on Wednesday with forgery, computer trespass, unauthorized use of a computer, computer tampering and criminal possession of forgery devices.

Walstrom reportedly learned his hacking skills during a New York University summer camp which teaches advanced programming and coding languages.

Despite his computer know how, his peers describe him as an 'average student' in other subjects who 'isn't that interested in school'.

'You’d think a kid smart enough to hack his school’s computers would already have good grades,' a law enforcement source told the New York Post, commenting on the incident.

'Maybe the [Department of Education] should hire him to expose weaknesses in their security firewalls.'

A fellow student of Walstrom's had a different take on things. 

'Maybe he can get a secret service job later on,' Sean Morris, 16, told the paper.

The NYPD have not yet responded to Daily Mail Online's request for comment on the hacking case. 

It is not known if Walstrom will be suspended from New Dorp HS for the reported misdemeanors.
