The White House lawn is one of the most famous places in the world, yet pilots flying the President and Vice President in Marines One and Two still need a bit of help with their landings, by way of giant ‘coasters’.

The helicopters are also guided by yellow strips to indicate which way they should be facing.

Once Marine One, which is either a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk or VH-3D Sea King, takes to the air several other helicopters of the same make join it to fool would-be assassins.

This is referred to by some as the presidential 'shell game'.

Each helicopter is fitted with missile counter-measures, such as flares and chaff.

It also has extras, such as a toilet, not found on standard helicopters.

The Marine One fleet is overseen by a huge staff of 800 Marines and is based in Virginia.

President Obama has taken 1,078 flights on Marine One, according to CBS News.
