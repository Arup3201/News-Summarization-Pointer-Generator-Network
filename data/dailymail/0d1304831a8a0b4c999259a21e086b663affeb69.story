Buyers might be reluctant to describe a potential new home as a pigsty - but in this case the comment would be justified.

When this one-bedroom property in Ipswich was first listed online, estate agents accidentally included a picture of a pig snoozing in the living room.

In another image of the detached home, which is on the market for £120,000, a cat can be seen perched on the oven.

The pig, which belongs to the house's current owner, is pictured resting on a thread-bare rug near a TV in the open plan lounge area in the Ipswich property

One of the other photos  featured a cat perched on top of an oven in the kitchen - which opens out into the living space

The detached house, which used to be a meeting hall, is currently on the market for £120,000 - but the price does not include the pig

The pig, which belongs to the house's 
current owner, can be seen resting with its head on the sofa next to a 
filing cabinet and makeshift washing line.

When the photo first appeared online, people took to Twitter to speculate whether the animal was included in the asking price.

One user joked: 'Delightful property for sale in Ipswich. Not sure if the pig is included in the asking price.'

The property, on Britannia Road, also boasts a bathroom, entrance hall, separate toilet and loft bedroom.

The photo of the pig, which was posted on Rightmove, was later removed by estate agents Connells, who listed the property.

The photo of the pig has been removed from the property's listing, though it is believed it still features in printed promotional material

Ipswich estate agents Connell said that the pig belongs to the house's current owner and said that the photo was put up by accident

But it is 
understood that the image still appears in printed publicity material 
for the property - which was designed before the pig was spotted online.

The
 listing states: 'This unique one bedroom detached house formerly a 
Meeting Hall situated in the ever popular of East Ipswich lying within 
close proximity to primary and secondary schools.'

A
 spokesman for Connells said: 'The pig in the photo is the home owners 
pet. The photos were put up in error and have since been removed.’
