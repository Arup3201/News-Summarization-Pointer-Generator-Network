When you are the first beaver to be spotted in the wild in England for 800 years, it must get a little lonely.

So thankfully, the male pictured at the aptly named River Otter last month has now found some companions to swim with.

Amazing images of the family of wild beavers have been captured by the same retired environmental scientist who pictured the solitary male.

Just months after a solitary beaver was spotted near the River Otter in Devon, new pictures have emerged showing the creature is not alone. A total of three beavers, two are pictured, have been caught grooming themselves, gnawing the base of trees and playing together in the same location

The three European beavers are thought to be adults and were filmed paddling together and gnawing at trees on the riverbank.

Their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries.

Eager beavers: Could the Environment Agency be replaced by furrier workers?

Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river in east Devon after he first noticed trees had been nibbled there last October.

He said he believed the male had been lost from a breeding farm but nobody claimed him.

There are several such programmes in the UK, including the nearby Ottery St Mary, but none of the animals are unaccounted for.

‘When we saw three, that’s a totally different situation altogether,’ said  Mr Buckley.

‘Three indicates a family and looking at the footage, all three are  quite sizeable and active, which indicates to me that they are not young. I would expect them to be at least two years old.

‘That indicates they may have been around for at least two years or more.

‘During that time, they may have been fitting in very nicely in terms of the environment.’

Mr Buckley said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he came across the images of the first beaver at the river last month.

‘For me, there was a combination of amazement and a little bit of disbelief,’ he said.

‘I had looked through hundreds of video clips and there was nothing at all in them.

‘Then there was one beaver, I was a little bit taken aback.’

The trio has also been seen interacting with local wild otters and felling trees in the area. The beaver is shown in the bottom left of this image, while the top of the otter is the shown swimming past him

Beavers were hunted to extinction in England and Wales during the 12th Century and disappeared from the rest of the UK 400 years later. Landowner David Lawrence admitted he has no idea where the creatures, a single beaver is pictured, have come from

Beavers were once common throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in England and Wales 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur, meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure.

They remained in Scotland but disappeared from the UK completely 400 years ago.

Natural powers: Facts about beavers

The family’s arrival in Devon this month remains a mystery but David Lawrence, who owns the land, said he is delighted with his new neighbours.

‘We are quite happy for them to be here,’ he said. ‘At some point we will possibly have to go in and clear up some of the wood because it could possibly cause a flood problem.

‘But it’s all very interesting – my wife has just started a holiday business with a safari tent and this will give people something extra to look at.’

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is investigating the sighting. A spokesman said: ‘It is unlawful to release beavers in England – we are looking into this case and will consider what action to take.’

Steve Hussey, of the Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘This is not necessarily the right way to go about having beavers reintroduced to the English countryside. It would be better if it was done in a planned way.

‘But now they are here we need to take a really close look on the impact they have.

‘I think we should leave them alone but observe their impact on the local landscape.’ There are two species of beaver, the European and North American. The European is considered ‘vulnerable’.

It is extinct in most of Western Europe, with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from Eastern Europe to the Chinese and Mongolian borders.

There were several attempts to breed American and European beavers to boost numbers of the European species, until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible.

Sightings of a single beaver, pictured, were reported in July 2013, and again in January this year, in the same location where the family has been seen. These images, as well as the new shots of the beaver family, were all captured by retired scientist Tom Buckley

During recent years beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for. Here, a beaver gnaws on wood in captivity

Tom Buckley used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island near the river, after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees. This image is one of the results

The retired scientist first noticed a tree that had been damaged from nibbling, which made him want to get photographic evidence of the beaver's existence.This photo documents the damage done by the wild beaver
