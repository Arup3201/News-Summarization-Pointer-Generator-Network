Aston Villa have announced the signing of French defender Aly Cissokho from Valencia, subject to international clearance.

The 26-year-old left-back has agreed a four-year deal with Paul Lambert's side.

Villa announced the move on their official Twitter account, saying: 'Aly Cissokho has joined us on a four-year deal from @ValenciaCF, subject to international clearance.'

Transfer: Valencia signed Cissokho from Lyon for £5m two years ago, but would accept less than half that now

Cissokho, who has won one cap for France, joined Liverpool on a season-long loan last August, but made only 15 league appearances for Brendan Rodgers' side before returning to Valencia.

The full-back moved to the Spanish club from Lyon in 2012, while he has also played for Porto, Vitoria Setebal and Gueugnon, where he began his senior career.

Cissokho joins the likes of Kieran Richardson, Joe Cole and Philippe Senderos as new arrivals at Villa Park this summer. 

The 26-year-old French international, 26, cost around £2million and is likely to push Joe Bennett down the pecking order.

Paul Lambert has been looking to strengthen that area of his team after Ryan Bertrand's loan move came to an end. 

The Villa manager plans to use Kieran Richardson further up the pitch.

Signings: Paul Lambert has already signed Philippe Senderos, Joe Cole and Kieran Richardson this summer
