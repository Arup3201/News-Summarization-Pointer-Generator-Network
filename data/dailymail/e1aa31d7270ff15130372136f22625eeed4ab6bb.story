Swansea City have completed the £8million signing of Federico Fernandez from Napoli.

The centre-half wrapped up a medical in Wales this week and has signed a four-year contract, becoming the Welsh club's most expensive defensive signing.

The 25-year-old, who played for Argentina at the World Cup, will fill the centre-back void left by Chico Flores’s departure, partnering Ashley Williams.

His move is subject to international clearance, but he is expected to go into the Swansea squad to face Burnley on Saturday.

Speaking in anticipation of the move, Williams said: ‘I saw a little bit of him on TV during the World Cup when he was playing for Argentina, but that's about it.

‘So I'll be doing what the fans do – checking out all his clips on YouTube.

‘All I can say is that, if he's been playing at for teams as good as Napoli and Argentina, then he is bound to be a good player.

‘We need to strengthen the squad because it's going to be a long, difficult season ahead - just as the others have been.’

Napoli have signed Holland midfielder Jonathan De Guzman after allowing Argentina defender Fernandez to move to South Wales.

De Guzman spent the past two seasons on loan at Swansea from Spanish club Villarreal, scoring nine goals in 59 league appearances.

He said: ‘I am happy to have come to Napoli. I can't wait to start.’
