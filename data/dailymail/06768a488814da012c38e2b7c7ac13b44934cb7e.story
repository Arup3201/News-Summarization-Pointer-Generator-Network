Ed Miliband, who promised that if Labour win the election, they would freeze energy bills for 20 months 

Ed Miliband plan to freeze energy prices is putting firms off cutting household bills before the election, experts say.

The Big Six firms have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers as the crude oil price has plummeted, dipping below 50 dollars a barrel this week compared with 115 last June.

George Osborne has warned energy firms and airlines to cut their prices. Some estimates suggest families should have seen average annual bills fall by £140 due to tumbling wholesale prices.

But analysts now believe that Labour’s promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months if they win office – to fix the ‘broken energy market’ – may be keeping prices high.

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said energy firms buy their supplies up to two years in advance so cannot pass on savings immediately, but the price freeze is also a big factor.

He said: ‘The risk is that by the time the energy firms are able to buy cheaply, we get towards the election in May. If there’s a Labour government and they bring in the price freeze, the suppliers run the risk that they will be locked into those prices for 20 months, even if wholesale costs go up. It’s a disincentive for them to cut prices.

‘Labour’s policy has become a big factor in the price decisions energy companies are making. I’m neutral, and I don’t think freezing prices is a bad policy, but Labour shouldn’t have announced it in advance, as it allows the energy firms to game the system.

‘They are far more wary of cutting prices than they would have been, in the short-term. I can’t see the energy firms cutting prices before the election.’

A senior source at one Big Six firm said: ‘I wouldn’t completely rule out a cut in prices before the election, but the threat of the price freeze makes it a lot more difficult.

‘Household bills are not just affected by wholesale prices, but also network costs, which are rising, and government policies such as smart meters. The price freeze gives us a fourth consideration.’

Mr Miliband’s policy, announced at his party conference in 2013 was seen as a game changer for the Labour party and polls show it is backed by voters. He claimed it would save households £120 each per year on a typical dual fuel deal, and that business would be £1,800 better off.

Lakis Athanasiou, a utilities analyst at Agency Partners said the election and also the competition inquiry into the energy market ordered by ministers which reports later this year, are holding up price cuts. ‘The price freeze is a damp squib for gas bills, because of falling wholesale prices. If it happens – the energy companies will just make money’, he said.

‘There is leeway for energy firms to cut gas bills now, but I don’t think it will happen in 2015. But only gas – there is no leeway to electricity bills, on which energy firms are looking to make a loss this year because of the carbon taxes and green policies.’

Dougie Youngson, Oil & Gas Research Director at finnCap added: ‘In most respects, it’s a completely unworkable policy [the price freeze]’, he said. ‘It would be an unprecedented intervention by the government and it’s difficult to see how it would be implemented.’
