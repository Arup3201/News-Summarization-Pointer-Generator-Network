Wilfried Bony brought a smile to the face of one young Manchester City fan ahead of his imminent arrival to the club.

The 26-year-old, who is set to join the Premier League champions for close to £30million after add-ons from Swansea, posed for a picture with City supporter Robert March in Abu Dhabi at the weekend.

Bony is currently in the Middle East with the Ivory Coast squad as they prepare for the Africa Cup of Nations and bumped into the youngster who was also in the Emirates as that's where his parents work.

City are set to sign  Bony after ongoing talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal

From a bootless young parent in the Ivory Coast to a £30million target for one of European football's biggest clubs, via the Czech Republic, Holland and Wales. 

Wilfried Bony's career path is one less travelled, but then this is a man who does nothing in a conventional manner.

And the chance encounter saw March grinning from ear-to-ear as he met up with one of the Premier League's deadliest marksmen.

March, who plays for City's academy, could be coming up close and personal with the striker more often in the future after Swansea accepted the Etihad Stadium's outfit for their star asset.

Sportsmail understands the initial fee is £25m up front, plus a further £3m if City win the Barclays Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup, though Bony would have to figure in 60 per cent of games in those competitions.

Swansea had been locked in talks with the Premier League champions over the structuring of the transfer, with City having to satisfy Financial Fair Play criteria to enable a move for the prolific 26-year-old.

But after those issues were resolved, City will now wrap up their move for the striker, who will not be available for selection until he returns from the Africa Cup of Nations.

Bony, who has scored 34 goals in 70 games for the Swans, is understood to have agreed personal terms of £100,000 a week on a four-year contract.
