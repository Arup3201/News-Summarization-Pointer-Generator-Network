A Russian World War I destroyer has been found at the bottom of the Black Sea - with its ten-ton gun still intact.

The torpedo-equipped destroyer, called the Lieutenant Zatsarenny, was sunk by a German cruiser after it hit a sea mine in 1917.

It now lies 90ft underwater near Zmeinyj Island - also known as Snake Island – off the coast of Ukraine.

The ship, which was part of the Russian Imperial Navy, was sunk 97 years ago by the Breslau, an infamous German light cruiser which stalked Black Sea shipping during the Great War.

The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was equipped with a massive 120-millimeter gun which weighed ten tons. The gun is still intact and attached to the ship’s deck.

Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, was among a diving team which explored the wreck.

He said: ‘It was amazing to dive a wreck which had been on the sea bed for more than 90 years. The gun was particularly impressive to look at. It was like swimming next to a piece of history.’

The island of Zmeinyj was a watch post during World War One, and in 1917 the Breslau attacked the island, taking 11 Russian and Romanian prisoners captive.

Battle over: The Lieutenant Zatsarenny, was sunk on June 17th, 1917, by a German cruiser called the Breslau which had planted sea mines near the island

The order was given to restore the 
watch post at Zmeinyj and the Lieutenant Zatsarenny left Odessa, Ukraine
 on the morning of June 17th.

Unfortunately the Lieutenant Zatsarenny was put on a collision course with one of the sea mines laid out by the Breslau.

At 1.30pm the destroyer struck a mine and a charge with 114 kilograms of explosives ripped through its hull.

The
 explosion killed 37 crew members and passengers. The Lieutenant 
Zatsarenny sank to the bottom of the sea, nearly three miles off the 
coast of the island.

Leftovers: Torpedos stored in the hull of the Lieutenant Zatsarenny

The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was one of a number of Russian destroyers named after Crimean war heroes. It was part of a fleet launched in Nikolayev in 1907.

The Lieutenant Zatsarenny was the first of these to sink. The other ships sank in the First World War, but all were raised during the Soviet period and used as scrap metal.

Mr Nekrasov said: ‘The only ship in this fleet that we can see and touch today is the unlucky Lieutenant Zatsarenny.

‘History loves such paradoxes. The destroyer was destined to die in order to outlive its more fortunate brothers.'
