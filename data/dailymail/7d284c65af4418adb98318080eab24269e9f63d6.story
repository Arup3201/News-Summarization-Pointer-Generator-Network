A mother has given her first television interview since she was ordered to stop breastfeeding her baby in a public swimming pool.

Appearing on This Morning, Stephanie Wilby, 22, mother of four-month-old Leo, defended her right to breastfeed in the toddler pool at Manchester Aquatics Centre - an issue which divided public opinion when it came to light last week.

'I don't see the unhygienic part of this,' she said, when host Ruth Langsford expressed her misgivings about the potential dangers of feeding her son in the water - citing the veruccas, germs and bacteria present in public baths.

Stephanie said it would have
been more dangerous to feed in the changing rooms - where staff 
directed her - saying they were 'dirty and unhygienic.'

It was reported last week that Stephanie
was 'waist-deep' in the toddlers' pool, but she now denies this, saying she was standing in the shallow end, with Leo raised up out of the water.

When asked why didn't initially sit beside the pool to nurse Leo, she explained: 'This wasn't about a feed - it was to soothe my son. If I'd left the pool, it wouldn't have been right for Leo.

'There was no safety risk, there was no health risk.'

At the end of the interview, Leo joined his mother on the This Morning sofa.

'How could you not feed him?' the doting mother asked Eamon and Ruth.

'He shouldn't be the boss all the time,' was Eamon's reply.

And viewers seemed to agree with him, with only 26 per cent in favour of breastfeeding in public pools in a poll conducted by the show.

Thousands of readers have had their say on the website and on Twitter about whether Stephanie Wilby should have been breastfeeding little Leo in the pool:

Lily McPhilimey @PixiegirlLily tweeted: 'No breastfeeding #MailOnline I'm all for feeding but even I wouldn't there!'

Martin, from Oxford commented: 'I don't see there is a problem. breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world. I worry about some people I really do.'

xcountmeinx, from Hereford, said: 'Not in a swimming pool for heavens sake.'Living life by FISH, from London, commented: 'Fair enough - I can't eat in the swimming pool nor can you little one! But it's not "indecent"'Linda Malaga, from Malaga in Spain added: 'I agree wholeheartedly with breastfeeding in public provided it is done in a discreet manner and not in full view of everyone. Feeding in a public swimming pool is completely wrong! After all you wouldn't eat your lunch whilst waist deep in a public swimming pool would you????'

Kim from North Lincs said: 'Totally disgusting, why should the rest of us and our kids be exposed to her feeding her baby in a pool, there is a time and a place for heavens sake. Sick of breast feeding mums trying to make a point at the expense of the rest if us.'

Touchwood, from Falkirk added: 'There's a time and a place; this wasn't the latter.'

Sandy Brown, from London, said: 'What is wrong with these women who do this. If you wish to feed your kid, then go somewhere else. Not where people are swimming.'Jeanie, from Devon, commented: 'I'm concerned that she was 'waist deep' in the water, it doesn't seem the safest place for a tiny baby breastfeeding or not. could have been handled better though obviously.'Louby87, from Grimsby, said: 'Certainly not the place for this. She must have known her baby was due for a feed so why get in the pool, she should have waited until after.'Sue, from Sheffield, said: 'She definitely should not do that in a swimming pool really disgusting.'

Diamonds are forever, from Hampshire, added: 'Yes he was right !!! There is a time and place for every thing...I wouldn't want to swim in her breast milk...nor if or when her child throws it back up again......Get real its a public bath !!'

Last week, Mrs Wilby, who is on 
maternity leave from her customer service job at British Gas, said: ‘I 
should be allowed to breastfeed where I want.

‘As long as I do so tactfully and I 
am in within the law then I should not be harassed by people  telling me
to stop. I was  humiliated and it was very distressing.'

She said one staff member told her  
breastfeeding in a pool was akin to a swimmer urinating in the water and
also amounted to ‘indecent exposure’.

‘They made a real scene,' said the mother-of-two.

'They were 
saying me breastfeeding was indecent exposure but I was covered more 
than most of the other swimmers.

‘One staff member also said he would 
stop a man urinating in the pool and that is why they did not want me 
breastfeeding in the water.’

Bosses at the state-of-the-art 
Manchester Aquatics Centre, a training venue for last year’s Olympics 
and Paralympics, have now apologised about the incident on Sunday 
afternoon.

Mrs Wilby from Denton, Manchester, said she had only moved to the side of the toddlers’ pool for a few moments to feed her son.

‘It was just a matter of a few 
seconds but the response from staff was dreadful. The manner in which 
they treated me was aggressive and upsetting and caused me major 
embarrassment.

‘If they did not like it they could have asked me quietly to stop,’ she added.

‘I would have still questioned their reasons but it would not have been as inappropriate.’

Mrs Wilby, whose husband also works 
in customer  service, added: ‘This was the worst possible customer 
service I have ever come across.’

The family have made an official complaint.

The aquatics centre, one of the 
largest in the country, is run by Serco and Manchester Sport and Leisure
Trust, part of Manchester council, which is investigating.

The Equality Act 2010 has made it 
illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place 
such as a cafe, shop or public transport.

However, it is not against the law to 
prevent a woman breastfeeding where there are legitimate health and 
safety risks.

Although restaurants and cafes 
generally do not have separate breastfeeding areas, some store chains 
such as Tesco and Boots do provide dedicated areas away from women’s 
toilets.

Other businesses have begun displaying stickers on windows telling mothers that breastfeeding is welcome on the premises.

New mother Stephanie Wilby was ordered to stop breastfeeding her four-month-old son Leo in a swimming pool at the Manchester Aquatic Centre after staff claimed feeding her son was 'indecent exposure' and similar to someone urinating in the pool

Councillor Rosa Battle, executive 
member for culture and leisure at Manchester council, said: ‘We keenly 
encourage new mothers to use our leisure facilities and they have every 
right to breastfeed their babies when they need to do so, in line with 
existing legislation.

'We have also asked that the Trust and Serco review their existing policies, to make sure that they reflect the law.

‘As a breastfeeding mother myself, I 
expect staff contracted to work in our leisure facilities to understand 
and respect women’s right to breastfeed in public places.’

A spokesman for Serco said: ‘We are fully supportive of mothers breastfeeding their child whilst in our centres.

‘Serco’s operating practices are to 
encourage breastfeeding in a safe and comfortable environment for both 
the mother and child rather than it taking place in the swimming pool.

‘We will fully investigate this 
matter and where appropriate we will amend our policies and put in place
appropriate training for staff.

‘We apologise for any inconvenience that was caused.’

Tara Powell was asked to stop breastfeeding her son Preston at the Jobcentre in Bromley

The Mail Online revealed last Wednesday a mother of five burst into tears after she said she was kicked out of a Jobcentre for breastfeeding her baby.

Tara Powell had taken her four-month-old son Preston with her to an appointment at the centre in Bromley, south-east London, where she was meeting to discuss her income support money.

Miss Powell, of Orpington, said the interviewer then told her she felt 'uncomfortable'. But the mother replied: 'There's nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son, it's natural.'

However the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was 'disgusting', adding: 'If you do not stop it, I'm terminating this interview'.

Mrs Powell added: 'She was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview.

'I was crying because she did that to me.She kicked me out for breastfeeding my son. I have never ever felt so embarrassed.'

Miss Powell said a manager apologised following the incident, and told her the appointment would have to be rebooked.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said Miss Powell was offered a private place to feed her baby after the meeting was ended, adding that the incident was being investigated.

She said: 'We have apologised to Ms Powell for any inconvenience and confusion caused during her visit to the Jobcentre.

'Mothers are welcome to feed their babies when visiting us. This can take place wherever the mother feels comfortable - either in a public area or a private room if one is available.'

A spokesman for We Do It In Public, a campaign group supporting breastfeeding in public, said: 'Perceptions of breastfeeding in public still continues to be a sticking point for both new and experienced mums who choose to breastfeed.

'It's such a shame that as a society we are still seeing cases where people are asked to leave public places, just because they are feeding their baby.'
