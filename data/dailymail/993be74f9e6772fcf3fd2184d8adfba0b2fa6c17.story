An alarming video of two shirtless men fighting in a street in regional Queensland has gone viral.

The footage was taken in Festival Street in Rockville - in the state's south-east - and starts off with just two men in a front yard exchanging punches while onlookers stand clear of the conflict.

But the incident soon escalates when a third man takes a large stick and bashes one of the men involved in the initial brawl with it.

The footage was taken in Festival Street in Rockville - in the state's south-east - and has gone viral

It starts off with just two men in a front yard exchanging punches while onlookers stand clear of the conflict

The exchange becomes so heated that it soon makes its way onto the neighbour's lawn, with some witnesses pulling out smartphones to film the exchange.

But it is not the first time, neighbours on Festival Street - an area with public housing - have heard of fights unfolding near their homes.

Resident Sarah Giddy moved with her husband and five children to Rockville just eight months ago and told The Chronicle she had already witnessed a number of other fights in the street. 

'It happens quite frequently and there are usually police here straight away,' she said.

'They haven't done anything to us but there are other people who could get hurt.'

Another resident - who wished to remain anonymous - said he had seen the fight take place on Saturday from his house.

He said the street had died down in previous years but incidents of this kind were starting to pop up again.

'It is mainly the young fellows,' the man told the APN-owned newspaper.

But neighbours say it is not the first time fights have broken out on the suburban street

The video was originally posted on Facebook and in just a few days it had attracted more than 400,000 views. 

This comes after a disturbing Facebook page emerged, featuring videos of students fighting at a Perth school.

Kinross College is looking to have the group shut down but Facebook is refusing to budge.

In one video on the Perth Fights page, two Year 9 students are seen punching and kicking each other, while being cheered on by other students.

Onlookers can be heard encouraging the fighters and are heard shouting: 'Go…fight, fight, fight'.
