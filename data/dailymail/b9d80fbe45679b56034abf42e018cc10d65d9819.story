Video footage has surfaced on social media of a group of people believed to be West Ham supporters chanting an anti-Semitic song as football became further submerged in racial controversy on Sunday.

The highly-offensive chant in the video, filmed on the London Underground, appeared after West Ham's 2-2 draw with Tottenham and included the words: 'I’ve got a foreskin, how about you? F*****g Jew.'

Anti-racism organisation Kick it Out released a short statement on Sunday night: 'Kick It Out has received several reports via social media about the footage and will be liaising with British Transport Police on the matter. In addition, we have been informed of a number of anti-Semitic tweets which we are reporting to the Police.' 

A spokesman for the British Transport Police said: 'We are aware of the footage and we are investigating it.' 

When contacted by Sportsmail, a West Ham spokesperson said the club would release a statement on Monday morning.

On Friday, West Ham had posted a message from the joint-chairmen, David Sullivan and David Gold, to supporters going to Sunday’s match which reiterated their zero tolerance policy towards any fan found to be acting inappropriately.

The statement read: 'We would also like to remind all fans attending the match at White Hart Lane that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our Club.

'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the Club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches.' 

This footage emerged on Twitter with a group of alleged West Ham fans chanting an anti-Semitic song 

There is history of anti-Semitic controversy by West Ham fans at Tottenham.

Two Hammers fans were cautioned and one was given a lifetime ban for racially-aggravated public order offences by police in 2012 after it was understood they made Nazi-style salutes during a match between the London rivals at White Hart Lane.

West Ham's co-chairman David Gold, who is Jewish, said at the time the club has a 'zero tolerance' approach to supporters found to have made anti-Semitic taunts. 

It has been a dark week for the game with this sad event coming days after Chelsea fans were caught on film pushing a black man off the Metro in Paris on Tuesday before singing a racist chant.

The incident happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris St Germain on Tuesday, which ended 1-1.

A former policeman, one of three men sought in connection with the allegedly racist incident, has apologised. Richard Barklie, 50, accepts he was there but said through his lawyer: ‘He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that.’ 

Meanwhile, Brighton and Hove Albion confirmed on Sunday that one fan had been arrested having used racist language at the Amex stadium.

A club statement released by Championship side Brighton on Sunday confirmed another racist incident within football: 'Brighton & Hove Albion can confirm two arrests were made at yesterday's match against Birmingham City: one on suspicion of use of racist language, in relation to an historic offence; and one for throwing a smoke bomb onto the pitch from the away end,' said the club's statement.
