Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura's defamation lawsuit against slain "American Sniper" author 
Chris Kyle - purportedly the deadliest ever American serviceman - will be allowed to go forward with Kyle's widow as the 
defendant, a federal judge ruled last week.

U.S. Magistrate Judge 
Arthur Boylan ruled on Thursday that Taya Kyle, who has been appointed executor of her 
husband's estate, would be a proper substitute in the case and says requests 
to substitute defendants are freely granted.

'(If) a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party,' Boylan wrote in his decision.

Ventura claims 
Chris Kyle defamed him to gain notoriety for his best-selling book, 'American Sniper,' in which Kyle describes a 2006 bar fight, claiming he punched someone named 'Scruff Face.'

In the book, Kyle claims he overheard 'scruff face' badmouthing the United States, then-President George W. Bush, and criticizing the Iraq War.

Ventura, a former professional wrestler known as 'The Body' - who is well known for his criticism of the Bush Administration and for questioning details of the September 11, terror attacks - was never specifically named in the book, but Kyle later identified 'Scruff Face' as the former Minnesota governor in subsequent television interviews.

Ventura claims the fight never happened.

An
attorney for Ventura had argued that Taya Kyle should be substituted as
a defendant because Chris Kyle's estate will continue to profit from 
book sales and a recent movie deal, and Ventura has a right to protect 
his reputation.

Taya Kyle's attorney had argued Ventura would
be better off dropping the case, saying that going forward would give 
the perception that Ventura had little regard for loved ones of deceased
war heroes.

Kyle is considered to be the deadliest sniper in
U.S. military history with 160 confirmed kills in combat. He was killed in February along with his friend 
Chad Littlefield at a Texas gun range by Iraq War veteran Eddie Ray Routh 
has been charged in their deaths.

Routh, is believed to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and Kyle was trying to help the troubled former soldier by taking him to the gun range to relax. Routh, instead, tragically turned the gun on Kyle and Littlefield, killing both men.
