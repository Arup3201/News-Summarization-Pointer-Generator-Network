Britain has the equivalent of one pothole for every mile of road in the country.

A combination of a harsh winter and dry summer has seen a dramatic increase in damaged roads more than 200,000 potholes.

Councils received 32,600 compensation claims in 2012/13 from drivers whose cars have ruined wheel rims, punctured tyres and damaged suspension as a result of the holes, a rise of 79 per cent on 2011/12.

The figures were revealed in a Freedom of Information request by breakdown company Britannia Rescue. They show that councils have paid out a total of £2.5million in compensation to motorists in the past financial year for pothole damage.

Lincolnshire County Council alone reported pay-outs totalling more than £358,665.

King Lane in Leeds, the B6273 in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and Holly Lane in Banstead, Surrey, were highlighted by councils as among the worst roads for potholes.

John Bilbrough, 79, of King Lane, said: ‘Our street and the neighbouring ones are appalling for potholes.

‘The council resurfaced all of King Lane four years ago, but it’s still in a shocking condition.

‘I reported a pothole that must have been 15 inches long, 12 inches wide and four inches deep. It would leave a biker for dead if one went over it.

‘The council did refill it within two hours of me reporting it but money raised from speeding fines should be pumped back into the council to help them with the cost of doing that.’

Robin Bulmer, 70, experienced a pothole problem on King Lane around 18 months ago.

‘There was a huge hole at the top of the lane and it shattered my car doors,’ Robin said.

‘The council are doing all they can to fill them in but the potholes keep propping up everywhere.

‘Smaller cars are more prone to accidents with potholes. With King Lane now being named as one of the worst, hopefully something will be done about it.’

Britannia’s report described road maintenance as ‘severely under-funded’ with around £16 per driver – less than 10 per cent of the annual road tax bill – spent on road surfaces and fixing potholes.

It added: ‘Short-term fixes are often chosen over longer-term solutions, with close to a quarter of councils admitting they usually temporarily fix potholes rather than resurface the area.

Unsafe: Potholes on Pinfold Lane in Leeds proving the city's roads are crumbling

Bumpy: Picture shows potholes on Halton Moor Avenue  in Leeds which have been repeatedly patched up

Costly: Councils received 32,600 compensation claims in 2012/13 from drivers whose cars have been damaged by potholes

Crumbling: Potholes on Cross Street in Leeds. One in ten people have had their cars damaged by potholes

‘The average cost of repairing a 
pothole is around £50, meaning the amount paid out by councils in 
compensation could have been used to repair more than 50,000 potholes.’

Around
one in ten people say their car has been damaged as a result of poor 
road surfaces over the past 12 months with the average repair costing 
£140.

One in eight motorists say they have had a ‘near miss’, while swerving to avoid a pothole.

Problem: Pinfold Lane in Leeds is pictured with more holes. Experts say road maintenance is underfunded

More holes: Halton Moor Avenue in Leeds. Cyclists have been making more and more claims

Mess: Potholes on Halton Moor Avenue in Leeds showing the centre of the road is weak

Driven to despair: Britain has the equivalent of one pothole for every mile of road in the country

Underfunded: A car dodges a pothole on Broomhill Road, Bristol. Breakdown company Britannia Rescue has called for more investment in road repairs

And
the charity Cyclists’ Touring Club said yesterday that there had been a
20 per cent increase in compensation claims by cyclists injured due to 
potholes.

Peter
Horton, managing director of Britannia Rescue, said: ‘Britain’s pothole
epidemic has resulted from years of under-investment in our roads and 
has been exacerbated by recent harsh winters.

'Motorists should protect 
themselves and their vehicles by reducing their speed on potholed roads,
and also reporting damaged roads to their local council.’
