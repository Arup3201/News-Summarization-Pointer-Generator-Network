A family were left heartbroken after teenage thieves butchered their pet turkey to put on their Thanksgiving dinner table.

Christa and Brian Caponi discovered that their beloved 30lbs turkey Tom was missing on Monday morning and when they found a trail of blood and feathers they feared the worst.

Two teenagers from their neighbourhood in Santa Rosa County, Florida have been charged with killing Tom using a bow and arrow after Mr Caponi spotted them on the family’s CCTV.

Santa Rosa County sheriff’s deputies 
arrested Joshua Anderson, 19, and Jacob Provo, 18, on Monday, both 
living in the Caponis’ neighbourhood.

Tom the turkey was like a member of the family, Mrs Caponi said, and was a favourite among the family’s menagerie of 50 cats, goats, chickens and roosters kept on their six acre Gulf Breeze home.

‘He was a family pet,’ Mrs Caponi told Pensacola News Journal. ‘It was like having a normal family dog.’

Mr Caponi saw the teenagers on a CCTV recording of the night Tom disappeared, and they have been charged with armed burglary, armed trespassing, theft of livestock and animal cruelty.

The pair were arrested on their way to
 prepare the bird for dinner, admitting they had planned to turn him 
into their Thanksgiving meal.

Mr
 Provo admitted to having entered the pen where Tom was kept and shot 
him with an arrow. Anderson told officers that he was accompanying Provo
 when the turkey was killed, PNJ reported.

‘He
 was so friendly,’ a devastated Mrs Caponi said. ‘My husband and I are 
big animal lovers and our animals are very close to us. It’s been a very
 rough two days.’

The two teenagers are in the Santa Rosa County jail on $57,000 bail.
