Footy personality Sam Newman could be in hot water defending suspended commentator Brian Taylor's decision to call a player a 'big poofter' on air.

Mr Newman, who has had a string of controversial incidencts in his career, reportedly made the comment at the 25th anniversary celebrations for The AFL Footy show which he hosts.

Despite the remarks causing furious fans to call for Taylor's dismissal on social media, the outrageous former footballer described the incident as 'harmless.'

Sam Newman makes light of the homophobic remarks made by football commentator Brian Taylor about Geelong player Harry Taylor last Saturday

'I know we’ve moved on and I’ve had a lot of those incidents and it’s not acceptable I understand that, but let’s not become too over the top,' he told Sydney Confidential. 'There’s plenty of other things that people say on a lot of different networks and a lot of different shows that are far worse than that, but Brian’s a big fish and they like to harpoon him.'

Newman has been involved in a string of controversial incidents in his post-game career, including pretending to smoke a bong on live TV and calling a Malaysian man a ‘monkey’.He was involved in his own alleged homophobic slur in May when he criticised the first openly-gay NFL player Michael Sam for kissing his boyfriend when he was drafted to the St Louis Rams.

'It was an annoying, gratuitous act,’ Newman said. 'Kissing your boyfriend ... No heterosexuals do that when they’re drafted.’

Meanwhile, 3AW have recommended Taylor to undergo 'quite severe counselling' but he will be back on radio next week.

Taylor apologised at half-time break of the television coverage and also to the Geelong player on the receiving end of the slur - Harry Taylor.

The comment came as footage was shown on Channel 7’s Saturday Night Footy panel show of Harry Taylor being chaired from the field last weekend after his 150th game when the popular Cat player did an unusual wave to the crowd.

The former Richmond and Collingwood full-forward is known for being a long-time critic of players celebrating ‘minor’ milestones.
