Beaten Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella insisted that Messi deserved to be named player of the tournament.

Messi,
 who scored four times in Brazil, appeared embarrassed when he went to receive the Golden Ball following Argentina’s defeat against Germany in the 
Maracana.

‘Messi did deserve to win player of the tournament because he played an extraordinary World Cup,' Sabella said.

'He was a fundamental factor of the team to get us where we are today. He deserves it, quite sincerely. The World Cup is a demanding tournament and he is at the top in the pantheon of players.’

Sabella also insisted that he has yet to make a decision about his future as head coach of the national team.

‘I don’t know what to say about the future for me. We won the 
other matches, the game against Holland for example. We didn’t have many
 shots on goal, but we won,' he said.

‘We
 had chances here. We needed efficiency, but in general terms I am very 
proud of our performance at the World Cup. It was exciting to watch them
 improve, they gave everything for the Argentinian jersey. 

‘They can look at each other in the eye and say they gave everything for the Argentina squad.

‘I don’t know how we will be received in Argentina. They deserve a wonderful welcome. They played a wonderful World Cup.

‘We
 will see how people react when we return. The players gave their all. 
That is the reality, they gave their all for the national squad. This 
was an extraordinary World Cup.’

Dejected: Argentina's Javier Mascherano said the defeat was impossible to take

Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano admitted defeat was impossible to accept after Mario Gotze’s stunning strike at the Maracana.

He said: ‘We gave everything we could out there. We had the best chances but we didn't take them. 

‘We
 only had to last another 5 minutes. The pain is immense. We wanted to 
win this for the people of Argentina, for those who came here to support
 us. 

‘But
 we have represented our country the best we could. We lament the fact 
that we haven't won, but we have to lift our heads despite the pain. We 
just didn't have that little bit of luck that you need in a final.’
