The gay waitress accused of making up a claim that a family left her an offensive note instead of a tip is 'sticking by her story' and has not yet been fired, the restaurant manager told MailOnline today.

Dayna Morales, a former marine, hit headlines last week when a picture of a receipt she allegedly received from a family at the Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, saying they didn't 'agree with her lifestyle' was posted online and went viral. 

On it she claimed the customer had written: 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life.'

Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55

Hoax: The family at the center of the controversy of whether or not they tipped a gay waitress at a New Jersey restaurant have denied they are bigoted and more importantly can prove they did tip the waitress

Confirmation: This credit card statement the family possess 'proves' that they paid a tip and their bill came to a total of $111.55 as shown on their receipt and that something has gone wrong at the New Jersey restaurant

Bemused: Morales denied any impropriety at all - claiming that someone had written that note and not provided her with a tip and that the handwriting was not hers - while the father of the family denies any inference of homophobia 

But a New Jersey family came forward claiming to be the customers involved and producing a receipt printed at the same time on the same date, for the same amount, except with an $18 tip.

They
contacted NBCNewYork.com after seeing news reports of Miss Morales' 
story and claim the whole thing is hoax designed to provoke reaction.

To
prove their point they also produced a Visa bill, which indicated 
their card was charged for the $93.55 meal plus the tip, for a total of 
$111.55.

Today, a manager at the restaurant said they have called in lawyers to investigate the incident and said it may well focus on CCTV footage of the family settling up.

‘We have cameras and yes, they are part of the investigation,’ the manager said. 

According to the manager Morales was a successful server since she was hired on the staff when the restaurant opened four months ago.

‘We’ve never had any issues with her; never before,’ said the manager, who added Morales informed management she served as a Marine when applying. 
‘She was always a very liked server'.

Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a 
marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with
two small children, treated her while she served them at Gallop Asian 
Bistro in Bridgewater on Wednesday

The manager confirmed that the diners have had ‘a couple conversations’ with the owners since the accusations of prejudice were thrown at them.

So far, the restaurant's manager is holding off on dropping support for Morales until the determine what happened. But she will not be returning for shifts until the investigation is complete.

‘It’s a terrible thing regardless which you look at it,’ the manager said. ‘We want to get to the bottom of it.’

But since Morales’ story has begun to unravel the restaurant manager said he hopes she didn't try to dupe them and the public.

‘It would be upsetting, but other than that we don’t want to go further.’

Morales and the restaurant have been left reeling since the family came forward. 

The husband said far from being homophobic he actually refused to vote for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie because the governor opposes same-sex marriage.

'Never would a message like that come from us,' he protested.

Morales announced last week she would donate thousands of dollars in gratuities from supporters to the Wounded Warrior Project. 

Suspicious: A reporter from NBC New York went to confront the owners of the restaurant as to why their customer was billed - including their tip - but their gay waitress received an abusive message and no tip

But the wife countered this gesture of apparent good will saying: 'I just felt like people have a right to know that - it's fine if people want to donate to her or to the Wounded Warriors but they're doing it under a false pretense.  

The restaurant reportedly could not produce the original receipt nor explain why the family was charged for the tip amount for the meal last Wednesday.

Morales claimed that she felt judged by the family began as soon as she introduced herself.

The mother, shocked by her short 
hair, allegedly exclaimed, 'Oh, I thought you were gonna say your name 
is Dan! You sure surprised us!'

She sent the receipt for the meal to Have A Gay Day 
and the LGBT Facebook Group posted it online, where it 
garnered hundreds of supportive comments.

In an email at the time
Morales said she was upset she'd served in the marines to protect such 
ignorant Americans and was concerned about the example the couple were 
setting for their children.

Still working: Morales has not been fired while an investigation is underway. She was also given thousands of dollars by well-wishers which she said she'd give to the Wounded Warriors charity

'Never in a million years did I think this would happen,' she told Have A Gay Day.

'I am THOROUGHLY offended, mad, p***ed off and hurt that THIS is what her kids will grow up learning and that I served in the Marines to keep ignorant people like them free.

'Sorry lady but I don't agree with YOUR lifestyle and the way you're raising your kids but you didn't see me throwing that in your face and giving you shitty service.'

Morales' story was met with an outpouring of support online, with a heterosexual Facebook user commenting, 'as a member of the heterosexual community, I beg your forgiveness for these ignorant people' and another wrote 'I hope those parents get publicly humiliated enough to never leave their house again! I feel sorry for their kids.'

Morales later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple's food, but her faith in humanity was now restored.

'You all have put the BIGGEST smile on my face tonight and made me realize that there are more good people in the world than bad,' she wrote.
