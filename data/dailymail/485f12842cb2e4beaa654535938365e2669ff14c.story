A mindless thug who stabbed a teenager to death after gatecrashing a party advertised on Facebook was caught smiling on CCTV just half an hour after the brutal killing.

Edward Redman, 18, who was jailed for life yesterday for the murder of Jay Whiston, 17, was seen catching a bus and talking on his mobile phone in the aftermath of the horrifying incident in Colchester, Essex.

The unemployed thug also appeared relaxed as he walked with two friends in an underpass.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard heard that 17-year-old Whiston was stabbed twice after he tried to defend his friend in what was described as a 'senseless and tragic' attack, in September 2012.

A jury took just three hours to find Redman guilty of murder, following a 12-week trial.

Unemployed Redman was told he will have to serve a minimum of 17 years when sentenced this afternoon.

Mr
 Whiston's mother Caroline Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly 
emotional victim impact statement delivered shortly before the sentence 
was handed down.

She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out.

'Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do.

'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb.

'Jay’s heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn’t miss it.' 

Casual: He then caught a bus, and video footage showed him talking on the phone and sitting on the back seat

Spotted: He crossed a railway line to reach the bus stop on the night of the stabbing

Jay Whiston was stabbed twice and collapsed outside the house, pictured, where the party was being held in Colchester, Essex in September 2012

The court 
heard that the attack happened on the evening of September 8, 2012 after
 a party had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter.

Around 100 youngsters appeared at the house on the cul-de-sac in Colchester for the party, including Redman. 

The court heard the party had been initially well organised until a number of uninvited guests, including Redman arrived.

The jury heard that Redman and his friends 'spread an air of fear' and told party goers that they were 'tooled up'.

The court heard that Jay Whiston, pictured here in France in 2009, tried to defend a friend when he was attacked at the house party

The court heard that a confrontation developed when one of Redman's associates attempted to steal alcohol from Mr Whiston's friends.

Redman stabbed Mr Whiston inside the house before following him onto the street where he delivered the second, fatal wound.

A post mortem found that Jay Whiston suffered one stab wound to the abdomen and a fatal wound to the upper chest

The court heard that Mr Whiston, from Clacton, Essex, collapsed onto the street and was rushed to hospital.

He was declared dead at 10.57pm. 

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Whiston suffered two stab wounds, one to the abdomen with the fatal blow to the upper chest.

Prosecution counsel Mark Milliken-Smith told the court: 'This case demonstrates the senseless and tragic taking of a 
young life, so full of promise.

'It’s another desperate example 
of the catastrophe and heartbreak brought about by the indiscriminate 
and cowardly use of knives.

'If any more evidence was needed that
 knife crime was prevalent, the events didn’t take place in a 
gang-overrun inner city estate but at a party staged at a house in 
suburban Colchester.'

Redman's father Gary, 52, his brother John and former girlfriend Shannon Fenlon were all convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Police investigating the killing said they had been faced with a “web of lies spun” by the defendants.

Gary and John Redman received a two year jail term while nursery assistant Ms Fenlon was jailed for nine months.

Speaking
 after the sentencing, Chris McCann from the CPS East of England, said: 'This is a case where, as every parent fears, a party got out of hand 
with tragic consequences for Jay Whiston and his family.

'More than 100 people turned up - many of them uninvited - among them Edward Redman and his friends.

'They
 brought an air of unpleasantness, intimidation and menace with them 
which tragically ended in Jay’s death after he told Redman they didn’t 
want any trouble.

'Sadly, that is exactly what happened as Redman took offense and stabbed him.

'This
 was a difficult investigation given the number of witnesses who 
attended the party and the efforts by the Redmans to conceal the truth 
but the prosecution worked hard to put the correct facts before the jury
 and after hearing all the evidence the jury was clearly convinced by 
the prosecution case, returning their guilty verdict after just three 
hours.'

Judge Charles Gratwicke described the crime as 'a vicious, cold blooded stabbing'.

Immediately after the stabbing, Redman was heard on the phone saying: 'Just tell them there was a big fight. You don't know anything about it.'
