Mauricio Pochettino has backed Harry Kane to handle the pressure of carrying Tottenham’s assault on the top four.

The 21-year-old has had a stunning season, netting 15 goals and, significantly, has been the club’s driving force in a run of seven games unbeaten in all competitions.

He’s scored six goals in that run and played a major role in leading Spurs to fifth in the Premier League. With an England call up likely, the challenge for the striker will now be managing expectation s.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane is mature enough to handle the pressure this season, says Maurico Pochettino 

The new Spurs manager has been credited with giving Kane the chance he deserved up front this season 

But Pochettino insisted on Friday he has no concerns about Kane enduring the pressure of his success.

He said: ‘Harry is young and he can handle this moment. Yes, I think he is mature. He is young but mature and the process was the right process to arrive in this moment. I think Harry is clever and he knows how to manage the pressure.’

The subject of pressure and the wider team’s mental toughness has been prominent in Pochettino’s debut season.

Their abject record against leading sides was held up as an example of that fragility, though the 5-3 demolition of Chelsea will surely go some way to instilling confidence in the side.

Pochettino, whose side face Crystal Palace on Saturday, believes that win could prove essential in the chase for a Champions League spot.

He said: ‘It is important to stop this idea. We must now believe we can beat sides like Chelsea. It was more than just one victory. It was a victory for getting belief into our tactics and the way we want to play.’

It remains to be seen how active Spurs are in the transfer market this month. The signs are that there will be movement, having signed Southampton’s head of recruitment Paul Mitchell, but Pochettino attempted to play down those prospects.

He said: ‘We are happy with our squad and our players. I don’t think there will be many changes. There are many rumours in this period but we don’t comment.’

Ryan Mason and Erik Lamela are both injured and will not face Palace.
