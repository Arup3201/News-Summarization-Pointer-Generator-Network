Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone believes his side are having a 'great season' despite them playing catch-up in La Liga's title race.

The defending champions sit seven points behind leaders Barcelona and are also 1-0 to Bayer Leverkusen after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.

But despite recent setbacks Simeone is refusing to write-off his side's chances of recreating their success of last season.

'There are still a lot of games left,' he told reporters on Friday. 'We'll have to wait to see how the league finishes and then we'll review what happened.

'You all like to compare this team to last year's, something I don't consider at all.

'I think we've got six points fewer than a year ago. I think we're having a great season.'

Atletico take on Espanyol on Saturday and Simeone is looking for three points to jump back above Valencia, who beat Deportivo on Friday evening. 

'We're hoping to get back to winning ways, which is important,' Simeone added.

'Hopefully, against Espanyol we can get back that consistency we had in the first half against Valencia, which is our way of playing and what makes us a difficult team to play against.'
