It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to discuss Scottish independence on the Muppet Show tonight.

Kermit the Frog has become the latest international star to warn Scottish voters against breaking away from the rest of the UK, in a fresh blow to Alex Salmond's dream of independence.

And after the SNP claimed the Queen could be ditched as head of state for an independence Scotland, Kermit revealed Miss Piggy is ‘willing to serve’ as a new Queen of Scotland.

With less than six months to go until the referendum, the issue of independence has become a global talking point.

Rock star David Bowie stunned the Brit Awards when he used an acceptance speech, delivered by model Kate Moss, to plead with Scots ‘stay with us’.

Now Kermit has joined the chorus of celebrities urging voters to remain in the UK.

Asked whether he agrees with Bowie, Kermit told The Big Issue: ‘Absolutely!’

However, he revealed his other half was preparing for Scotland to go it alone.

‘I understand that Miss Piggy is willing to serve as Queen of Scotland if there is a split. So you may want to guard your castles,’ Kermit added, while promoting his latest film in London.

A senior SNP minister said at the weekend that the Queen could be removed as head of state.

Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish justice minister, said ‘it will be for the people of Scotland to decide’ if the country becomes a republic or remains a monarchy.

Mr Salmond’s official policy is that the monarchy would be automatically be retained if Scotland decides to secede - but many in his party are staunch republicans.

Kermit added: ‘We love the UK!. We’ve made several movies here and, of course, this is where we shot The Muppet Show.

‘The British people really “got” our humour. Heck, you folks even get Fozzie’s jokes, but it was the great impresario, Lord Lew Grade, who gave us our first big break… and we’re forever grateful to him and to everyone here in England.’

Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether it had coerced the Muppets into the political debate.

‘Are you suggesting somebody might be pulling the strings?’ David Cameron’s official spokesman told journalists at a briefing.

He gave no answer when asked if the Prime Minister ‘had a hand in Kermit’.

A growing list of celebrities has come out against independence.

Singer Rod Stewart said: ‘I’d hate to see the Union broken after all these years - and I don’t think it will happen.’

Actor John Barrowman: 'All of us who believe in unity over division should use our voice to help win the referendum. We are stronger when we stand together.’

Even wee Jimmy Krankie, otherwise known as Janette Tough, said: ‘Alex Salmond can sod off ’cos I don’t want it. We don’t live in Scotland so we won’t get to vote and I don’t think it’s fair.’

Lookalikes: Lab assistant Beaker and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander

News that Kermit is backing Scotland remaining in the UK will come as no surprise to one member of the Cabinet.

Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has long been compared to Beaker, the ginger long-suffering sidekick of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.

He has also led Lib Dem opposition to independence, warning if Scotland goes it alone they would lose the right to use the pound in a currency union.

Mr Alexander acknowledged the similarity, writing on Twitter: 'I am reliably informed that Beaker agrees with @KermitOfficial - Scotland is #BetterTogether in the #UK #IndyRef @UK_Together'
