We all need a tonic in winter.

Mine has come in the form of a weekly virtual visit to Guadeloupe now that the new series of BBC’s Death In Paradise has begun: sunshine, sandy beaches and the handsome Kris Marshall.

But it’s also a reminder of a glorious week when I actually went to Guadeloupe - where the programme is shot - and saw this lovely island that combines the best of France with a typically Caribbean laid-back attitude.

A Caribbean classic: Guadeloupe has a sleepy feel, and brings a touch of French flair to the region

It comprises the tiny islands of Marie-Galante, La Desirade and Iles des Saintes and the main island, a butterfly-shaped landmass with two very different halves. Grande-Terre, to the east, is more developed, with clusters of small beach towns and long curves of powdery white sand.

The other half, Basse-Terre, is wilder, with flora and fauna-filled national parks, rugged black and surf-dashed beaches.

I based myself here at the Langley Resort Fort Royal. As did the Death In Paradise crew, it turned out - something I discovered when I spotted Kris Marshall and Will Mellor taking a shower together (I should point out that the shower in question was on the beach and that the two actors had just been for a swim).

This is not your typical tourist Caribbean island. It is one yet to be discovered by the wider world, although visitor numbers have been increasing since the first series of the show.

One day, I headed for the lush slopes of the La Grande Soufriere volcano. The hike to its blackened summit took 90 minutes, and the trail was littered with car-sized boulders.

A boost in profile: Guadeloupe is the tropical setting for the enjoyable BBC series Death In Paradise

As I neared the peak, the colour of the moss-covered rocks changed from green to a sulphurous yellow and squeaking bats dive-bombed me as I scrambled past their cave.

Reaching the top was like arriving on another planet, with mutant-like patches of impossibly bright green grass and steep slopes of smoking rock falling away into the seemingly bottomless caldera.

On the way home, I spotted a man pressing sugar cane by the roadside, and stopped to watch him push the thick stalks of vegetation through the rollers. The gloopy yellow juice drained into a container, and he offered me a swig. It was good, though I could almost feel my teeth rotting.

I spent my days on Marie-Galante impersonating Columbus, wandering along deserted beaches, eating fresh fish at bamboo-thatched restaurants and exploring the remains of crumbling windmills.

A hideaway on the edge of the surf: The little coastal village of Deshaies sums up the island's appeal

Back on the mainland, I discovered a reminder of the island’s dark past in the seaside village of Petit-Canal. Les Marches des Esclaves is a pathway connecting the harbour with the building where slaves would be taken for sale after arriving from Africa.

There’s a stone staircase engraved with the names of the countries they came from, and a notch in the wall where slave masters hung their whips.

I truly hope Guadeloupe doesn’t change. Despite its growing popularity, it has just one chain hotel - Grande Terre’s Club Med La Caravelle in the city of Sainte-Anne - and the Langley Resort Fort Royal is Basse-Terre’s largest and most luxurious place to stay.

Fans might recognise the main art deco-style building from the show, but guests in the know opt for the beach hut-style bungalows dotted along the private beach.

A place to sleep soundly: Tamara stayed at Grand Terre's Club Med La Caravelle

This is where I had my first encounter with a fellow Brit, who turned out to be Danny John Jules, aka Officer Dwayne Myers from the series.

I asked him if he’s enjoying his summer in paradise and he smiled. ‘What’s not to love about this place?’

I’m inclined to agree. 

Seven nights at Grande-Terre’s Club Med La Caravelle (08454 212 608, www.clubmed.co.uk) costs £1,296 per adult and £834 per child, excluding flights. Children under six stay free.

Air France (0207 660 0337, www.airfrance.co.uk) flies from Heathrow to Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, from £879 return.
