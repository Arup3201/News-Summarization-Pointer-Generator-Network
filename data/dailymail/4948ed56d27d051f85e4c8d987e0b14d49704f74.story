A billionaire oil magnate from Texas is embroiled in a bitter court battle with his son over a tell-all blog chronicling his drug and alcohol abuse and family rows.

Thomas Boone Pickens, 85, is taking legal action against his 58-year-old son Michael Pickens over his blog, 5 Days In Connecticut, in which the younger man denounces his family, accusing them of abuse and theft.

Mr Pickens Sr, who made a $1.4bn fortune buying and selling oil companies, is said to have launched legal proceedings after what began as a blog about Mr Pickens Jr's health problems became more personal and offensive.

The father, along with three of his children, is said to be suing Mr Pickens Jr over alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, libel, harmful access by computer and extortion.

Court documents are said to show Mr Pickens Sr, universally known as T. Boone Pickens, is concerned about damage to his family's reputation, and accuses his son of lying in a bid to extort $20m out of him.

In the blog, which he began in October last year, Mr Pickens Jr portrays himself as the victim of years of emotional abuse, writing about poor parenting, petty fighting, and drug and alcohol abuse.

Its author writes: 'I was clinically depressed at age 10.

'I began drinking beer and whiskey when I was 12 - by the time I was 17 I was a drug addict and an alcoholic smoking pot every day before and after school, eating my mother's valium and darvon and snorting cocaine and tripping on LSD.

'I drank until drunk five nights of every week of my life. I lived this way for 40 years - by the time my life imploded I had been physically addicted to Benzodiazepines and Opiates for 10 years.

'I was dead.'

Some posts describe Mr Pickens Jr's own drug and alcohol use, but others attack his family, accusing his siblings of drug dependence and stealing from their own mother, and accusing his father of being uncaring and unkind.

The family, which is based in Dallas, accuses Mr Pickens Jr of lying in a bid to extort money from his family.

A written testimony from Mr Pickens Sr quoted in the Daily Telegraph says: 'I am suffering physical manifestations of distress, including elevated blood pressure, which is very unusual for me.

'I am deeply embarrassed by Mike’s statements and actions.'

Meanwhile Mr Pickens Jr's son, also called Michael Pickens, who is not involved in the court battle, told Forbes: 'I love my father dearly, and I know he loves me.

'But this blog stuff is out of control, it’s not accurate in the least.'

Michael Pickens Jr has a long history of substance abuse, and in 2007 he was given probation for fraud.  His father paid $1.2m restitution to his victims, and paid for his son to go to rehab.
