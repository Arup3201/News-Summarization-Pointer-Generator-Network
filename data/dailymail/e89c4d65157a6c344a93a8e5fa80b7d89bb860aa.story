Britain loves nudity - and it is thanks to Queen Victoria, an artist has declared.

Notoriously stern, the 19th century monarch is often portrayed as a solemn and repressed widow.

But she was in fact an open-minded woman passionate about the naked form, according to photographer of nudes Spencer Tunick.

Tunick has been arrested five times for his large-scale installations in the US.

However, basking in Queen Victoria's legacy, the American can explore his controversial projects in the UK free from fear.

'I think there was such a strong love for the nude in art by Queen Victoria that it sort of set your midset towards body and art,' he told The Times.

'It survived and is flourishing today.'

'She had a passion for nudity.'

Queen Victoria commissioned numerous nude paintings over her -year reign, lauding them as 'beautiful'.

Commissions: She ordered Scottish painter William Dyce to create Neptune Resigning To Britannia The Empire Of the Sea - a large fresco of the Roman god playing naked with a gaggle of nude nymphs. At the time, Dyce wrote that Prince Albert 'thought it rather nude' but the queen had no issue with it

She ordered Scottish painter William Dyce to create a large painting of the Roman god Neptune playing naked with a gaggle of nude nymphs.

At the time, Dyce wrote: 'Prince thought it rather nude; the Queen, however, said not at all.'

Despite their differing opinions on the exposure of flesh, Victoria maintained her stance. She gave Albert at least three heavily nude paintings as birthday presents.

Historians have also found hints of the queen's penchant for naked flesh in her diaries.

She referred to a statue of Prince Albert with bare feet and a short kilt as 'very beautiful' - although her beloved husband later had the statue remodelled to be less exposed.

Vying for his attention: Exhibitionists in Hastings hold a flash mob on a wet and windy beach this January calling for Tunick to come to photograph them

The Hastings hopefuls lost out to Folkestone, Kent, where Tunick will hold a three-day exhibition of photographs from May 15

Almost two centuries later, British exhibitionists across the country compete for Tunick's attention. Last month, dozens of people gathered on a wet and windy Hastings beach in an impromptu flash mob to inspire the New Jersey-based artist.

Brighton residents also made a bid for the chance to host the controversial photographer, but lost out to Georges House Gallery in Folkestone, Kent.

Preparing for one of his photoshoots, which will be featured in this month's Museums At Night Festival, Tunick said this enthusiasm is a clear mark of Victoria's legacy.

His collection of images, featuring 250 volunteers in Folkestone, will go on display as a chain of viewfinders in the gallery from May 15.
