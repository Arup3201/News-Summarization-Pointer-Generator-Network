Children suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often dismissed as difficult youngsters who are over-treated.

But new research suggests that for many sufferers, the condition can continue long into adulthood and increases their chances of developing other psychiatric conditions, too.

The data also reveals children with ADHD are more likely to commit 
suicide or to be jailed as adults.

Children with ADHD often find it difficult to settle to tasks

The neuro-developmental disorder affects
seven per cent of children and affects more boys than girls. Those with ADHD are easily 
distracted, find it difficult to sit still and can act without thinking of the consequences.

The research, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is the first large, population-based study to follow children with ADHD into adulthood.

Lead author Dr William Barbaresi, said: 'Only 37.5 percent of the children we contacted as adults were free of 
these really worrisome outcomes.

'That's a sobering 
statistic that speaks to the need to greatly improve the long-term 
treatment of children with ADHD and provide a mechanism for treating 
them as adults.'

INATTENTIVENESS

Short attention span, easily distracted, appearing forgetful, unable to concentrate

HYPERACTIVITY

Unable to sit still, fidgeting, excessive talking and movement

IMPULSIVENESS

Acting without thinking, little sense of danger, unable to wait patiently

The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, followed more than 5,000 children born from 1976 to 1982 in Rochester, Minnesota. This included 367 who were diagnosed with ADHD, 232 of whom participated in the follow-up study when they were adults.

The scientists found that 29 per cent of the affected children still had ADHD as adults.

Of the children who still had ADHD 
as adults, 81 per cent had at least one other psychiatric disorder, as 
compared with 47 per cent of those who no longer had ADHD and 35 per cent 
of controls.

The scientists found that seven of the 367 children with ADHD (1.9
per cent) had died at the time of study recruitment, three of them from 
suicide. Of the 4,946 children without ADHD whose outcomes could be 
ascertained, only 37 children had died (0.7 per cent), five by suicide.

Ten children with ADHD (2.7 per cent) in jail at the time of the follow-up study.

Dr Barbaresi said ADHD was not just a childhood condition

Dr Barbaresi said: 'We suffer from the misconception that ADHD is just an annoying childhood disorder that's overtreated.

'This couldn't be further from the truth. We need to have a chronic disease approach to ADHD as we do for diabetes. The system of care has to be designed for the long haul.'

Dr Barbaresi added the study population was largely middle class, and the children tended to have good education and good access to health care.

'One can argue that this is potentially a best-case scenario,' he said.

'Outcomes could be worse in socioeconomically challenged populations.'

He advises parents of children with ADHD to ensure that their children remain in treatment as they enter adolescence. He added that they should beassessed for learning disabilities and monitored for other conditions, including substance use, depression and anxiety.
