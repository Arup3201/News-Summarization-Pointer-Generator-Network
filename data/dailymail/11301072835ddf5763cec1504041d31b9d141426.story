Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a very public meltdown after lashing out THREE times before being sent off during Real Madrid's 2-1 victory over Cordoba.

The Portuguese superstar had endured a miserable afternoon - that included being overshadowed by former Manchester United misfit Bebe - before he let his frustration get the better of him late in the game.

In an astonishing sequence of events, Ronaldo was initially unfortunate not to be sent off after taking a full-blooded swing at Jose Angel Crespo, which fortunately for the Cordoba defender was as accurate as the Real striker's shooting during the game.

The 28-year-old then followed this by kicking the leg of Frederico Edema, who disgracefully went down clutching his face, to earn a red card after failing to reach a through ball as Madrid chased a winner with the game level at 1-1.

Finally, when his earlier victim Crespo reacted to Ronaldo's obvious foul on his team-mate - the three times Ballon d'Or winner took a backhand swipe at his face before heading towards the dressing rooms for an early shower .

With Ronaldo out of  equation it was left to Gareth Bale to take any set-pieces and when his late free-kick was handled by Cartabia, who evened the playing field by being sent off, the Welshman stepped up to score the winning penalty and send Los Blancos four points clear at the top of La Liga ahead of Barcelona's game with Elche.
