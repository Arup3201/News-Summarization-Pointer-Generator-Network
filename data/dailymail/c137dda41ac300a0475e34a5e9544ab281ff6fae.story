The woman, named locally as Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arrested after the frozen bodies of a boy, approximately 11-years-old, and a girl, around 14-years, were discovered inside a plastic bag.

Police said the bodies appeared to a male aged approximately 11 years old and a female who was approximately 14 years old. They were found inside a plastic bag and appeared to be 'frozen'

Blair, who has two other children - 11-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter - has not been charged and is said to be a person of interest in the police investigation.

Police were called in by the bailiffs after they discovered the girl's body in the chest freezer next to the front door. Her siblings corpse was found later.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News.

Neighbors say Blair and that she goes by Angel,WXYZ Detroit reported. 

Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. 

Blair posted a photo with a message in January

On January 30, the posted a photo with a message.

It read: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' 

Before she was taken into custody, the mother reportedly said her son was raped and that the sexual assault had been carried out by his siblings.

Police have not confirmed that is the case and it is unclear if she was talking about the boy who was found in the freezer. 

She filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support.

Blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result.  

She had not been charged as of Tuesday evening. 

Her brother Marlon Blair said: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments.

'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.'

Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt said it appeared the bodies had been in the freezer for 'over a year' and that the mother had been living in the apartment 'with other children while the bodies were in the freezer'. 

'This is a terrible situation,' he said. 

According to Craig, Blair has two other children, aged 11 and 17, who are unharmed and currently in 'protective custody'.

No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched and police do not yet have a motive. 

Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, said Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'.

There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. 

People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. 

Lanier said: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house.

'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.'

Craig said the police are still 'trying to determine what happened'. 

The cause of death won't be known until after autopsies are conducted.

Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. 

She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 

'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. 

Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home. 

'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.'
