Well-wishers hoping to meet the Queen were again left disappointed yesterday after she chose not to accept flowers for the second week in a row.

A crowd of around 250 had hoped they would be in luck after she broke with the tradition last week.

Sienna Wheeler, eight, who is in a wheelchair after a hip operation, had travelled to St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with her sister Imogen, ten, and grandfather David Branton, 69.

She  said: ‘I don’t really mind that I could not give her my flowers. It was just a lovely to see her.’

The Queen broke with tradition last week by declining to accept flowers from children as she left morning service at St Mary Magdalene church.

Around a dozen children including a girl in a wheelchair had hoped that she would have a change of heart and hopefully turned up with flowers today.

But police officers monitoring the crowd told the youngsters that the Queen would still not be accepting them.

The Queen, who was dressed in a beige
 coat and matching hat, instead came straight out of church and was 
driven away in her maroon Bentley, accompanied by her cousin Lady Mary 
Colman.

Some children left 
their bouquets in a pile outside the 13th century church after police 
said the flowers would be taken to Sandringham House later.

Other
 youngsters handed their floral gifts to guests of the Queen who were 
walking the 600m back to Sandringham House with Prince Philip.

One of the Royal guests who accepted flowers told the child's mother: 'I am sorry. It is a great disappointment.'

Elizabeth Quintrell, 72, waited three hours in the cold with her great-granddaughters Kiera Quintrell, eight, and Megan Radford, six, only to be told that the girls would not be allowed to hand over their flowers.

Mrs Quintrell of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said: 'It was a great shame. There were only a few children here with bouquets so it would not have taken very long.

'I brought the two girls to Sandringham House in the summer and they saw the place where the Queen has her Christmas tree.

'I told them we would come back over Christmas and they might be able to give her some flowers and they had been looking forward to it.

'We made some special bouquets with red, white and blue flowers and I got them up at 6.30am so we could drive over.

'It was quite disappointing to be told that the Queen would not be taking flowers personally, but I suppose if I was her age, I probably wouldn't want to do it either.'

Sienna Wheeler, eight, of Bury St 
Edmunds, Suffolk, who was in a wheelchair after a hip operation last 
month was also told that she would not be able to hand over flowers to 
the Queen.

She and her 
sister Imogen, ten, went to the church with their grandfather David 
Branton, 69, but could only watch as the Queen got into her car.

Sienna said: 'I don't really mind that I could not give her my flowers. It was just a lovely to see the Queen.'

The little boy was comforted by his mother after the Queen broke with tradition by not stopping

Mr
 Branton of Spalding, Lincolnshire, said: 'We did bring some flowers 
along, but the Queen didn't take them. We were told to leave them and 
the girls were happy with that.

'We don't want a sob story. The girls were just thrilled to see the Queen and they were warned that there was a chance that he Queen might not accept the bouquets.'

Veteran Royal watcher Mary Relph said she thought the Queen's tradition of accepting flower outside church had now 'finished'.

Speaking outside the church, she added: 'I don't want to say anything about it.'

The Bishop of Rochester, the Right Rev James Langstaff, preached at the service today before joining the Queen at Sandringham House. Last week Buckingham Palace dismissed suggestions that the Queen was not accepting flowers as she did not want to be late for lunch.

A palace spokesman said: 'Her Majesty is always grateful whenever people wish to present flowers and she accepted many flowers on Christmas Day. However, she does not accept them in person on every occasion.'
