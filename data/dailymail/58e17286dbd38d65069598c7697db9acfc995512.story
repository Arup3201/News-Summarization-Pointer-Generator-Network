Cyclist Lance Armstrong is being sued by Sunday Times for the return of damages it paid him in 2006

Lance Armstrong is being sued by The Sunday Times for more than £1million after it lost a libel action to the disgraced cyclist for printing doping claims now known to be true.

The Sunday Times paid Armstrong £300,000 in 2006 to settle a case after it reprinted claims from a book alleging that Armstrong had taken performance-enhancing drugs.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency concluded this year that Armstrong ran a doping programme on his teams and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life.

The shamed cyclist immediately fell from grace – losing endorsement deals and he even formally cut ties with cancer Charity Livestrong.

The Sunday Times announced in an article in its latest edition that it has issued legal papers against Armstrong.

'It is clear that the proceedings were baseless and fraudulent,' the paper said in a letter to Armstrong's lawyers.

'Your representations that you had never taken performance enhancing drugs were deliberately false.'

The paper, which is owned by Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp., said its total claim against Armstrong is 'likely 
to exceed' £1million pounds ($1.6 million).

This year Armstrong was banned for life and stripped of all results 
since August 1998, including his seven successive Tour wins when the U.S. 
Anti-Doping Agency released a massive report detailing allegations of 
widespread doping by Armstrong and his teams.

The
 document ordered 14 years of his career results erased - including 
the Tour titles. It contained sworn statements from 26 witnesses, 
including 11 former teammates.

December - Sunday Times demands more than £1million from Lance Armstrong after they lost a libel action to him in 2006 for printing doping claims.

The 41-year-old Armstrong, who overcame life-threatening testicular 
cancer, retired from cycling a year ago.

He announced in August that he 
would no longer fight the doping allegations that have dogged him for 
years.

In October he was ordered to pay back all the cycling prize money he won while using performance-enhancing drugs.

Armstrong is now set to lose at 
least £30million in sponsorship deals over the next five years after a 
string of companies followed Nike's decision to ditch the disgraced 
cyclist.

Bike sponsor Trek 
Bicycles and helmet sponsor Giro are among the glut of companies who have distanced 
themselves from the cyclist.

Technology retailer Radioshack also decided to have 
nothing more to do with the 41-year-old as did food maker Honey Stringer
 and health club franchise 24HR Fitness.

Energy drink manufacturer FRS said Armstrong had been 'on its board for several years but had resigned.'

Just two hours after Nike said it was terminating its contracting with the star Anheuser-Busch followed suit.

With
 his career and reputation in tatters the athlete seemingly no longer 
offers sponsors the image or publicity they desire from a sports star.
