Germany attacking midfielder Marco Reus has been ruled out of the World Cup on Saturday with an ankle injury sustained in a 6-1 friendly win over Armenia.

The German Football Federation said that Reus suffered a partial ligament tear in his left ankle in the match Friday and will miss six to seven weeks before he can resume training again.

Reus said: 'I really don't know how I am meant to find the words to express how I am currently feeling.

'A dream has ended from one second to the next. But I have got to look forwards and be very professional about my rehabilitation because life must go on.

'I will come back, even stronger than I was. My best wishes now go to the whole team and that they reach our goals without me.'

'For him and for us this is extremely regrettable,' Germany coach Joachim Low said.

'Marco
 was in excellent form; he made an outstanding impression in the 
training camp and in both (friendly) matches against Cameroon and 
Armenia. He exuded enthusiasm for the game. He played a central role in 
our planning for Brazil.'

The 25-year-old Reus was one of the few German players to have impressed consistently coming into the World Cup.

Former Everton defender Shkodran
 Mustafi was called up as a late replacement for the Borussia Dortmund 
player. The 22-year-old Sampdoria man was part of Germany's 30-man 
preliminary squad and took part in the training camp in northern Italy

'It's not about replacing Marco Reus directly,' Low said. 'We have a lot of quality for the position behind the forward.

'Here
 we have in Lukas Podolski, Andre Schuerrle, Mario Goetze, Thomas 
Muller, Mesut Ozil, Julian Draxler and Toni Kroos enough options. So we 
decided for another option in defense.'

Mustafi told the dpa news agency that Loew had phoned him as he was on his way home.

'I'm very sorry for Marco, but of course I'm happy that I can be there,' Mustafi said.
