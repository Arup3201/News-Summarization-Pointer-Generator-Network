Prince George might have been in London but Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall had other grandchildren to entertain them as they enjoyed a day out at the Highland Games.

With them was Camilla's daughter Laura Lopes and her three children Eliza, six, and twins Gus and Louis, five.

Wrapped up warm in little anoraks, the children appeared to be having a lovely time with one of the twins even running up to throw his arms around a delighted Charles' legs.

Eliza, who
 played a starring role as a bridesmaid at the 2011 wedding of the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge, also seemed intrigued by the Prince of Wales' 
sporran and crept up to take a closer look.

The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, as they are known north of the border, are currently holidaying at their Scottish home of Birkhall which sits on the Balmoral estate, close to Ballater.

Despite living close by, this was their first visit to the village's games but they certainly appeared to enjoy it, even toasting the festivities with a glass of whisky.

Arriving at the event in the Aberdeenshire village, they were greeted by games secretary Ron Drever and Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire James Ingleby, while Camilla was handed a posy by dancer Abigael Gray, 11.

Once they had taken their seats, the royal couple watched the hammer throwing and a parade by the Ballater and District Pipe Band, while enjoying their whisky.

Later, they were shown old photographs of Deeside 
displayed by the Ballater Local History Group, including images of 
their Scottish home Birkhall.

'They loved the photos,' said chairman Alastair Cassie afterwards. 'Camillla said she wished she'd brought her glasses.'

Charles
 signed a guest book at a tent where members of Clan Farquharson had 
gathered, with some travelling from as far as Australia to attend the 
event.

Captain Alwyne Farquharson, 16th chief of the Clan Farquharson, is chieftain of the Ballater Highland Games.

Jane
 Marland from Sydney, a member of the Clan Farquharson Association of 
Australia, said: 'It's great to be here, I'm enjoying it very much.'

Cute: The royal couple were shown a trio of Scottish Terriers, including the patriotically daubed Maggie (centre)

Warm welcome: The couple were given a warm welcome while Charles looked impressed with local cheese

Exciting: Most of the crowd were thrilled to see the couple but two boys chose to play with guns instead

Cosy chat: Prince Charles was on jocular form, laughing and chatting with members of the public

Husband
 and wife Carla and Louis Brijer from the Hague in the Netherlands 
chatted to the Prince of Wales as he toured stalls selling locally made goods.

'He asked me where I was from and I told him that we 
were on holiday in Scotland and had been staying in Cullen and in St 
Andrews,' said Mrs Brijer, 59. 'It was great to meet him.'

Games secretary Mr Drever said the royals were welcome guests. 'It was an informal visit and our Games have just run as scheduled,' he added.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall traditionally spend the summer months in Scotland at their Aberdeenshire home, Birkhall, which is just a few miles from Balmoral.

Balmoral Castle sits between Ballater and Braemar and the Queen is patron of the Braemar Gathering, which takes place this year on Saturday 6th September.
