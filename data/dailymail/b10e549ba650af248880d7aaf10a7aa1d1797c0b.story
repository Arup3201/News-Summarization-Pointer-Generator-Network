A bitter ex-girlfriend used make-up to accuse her former boyfriend of rape  after he dumped her.

Kira Lee Gould, 22, from Australia, applied a layer of powder to her face before going to the police where she claimed her partner, Warren Clark had repeatedly hit her.

Those allegations led to Clark, a former Royal Navy Able Seaman, losing his job.

Cover up: Warren Clark was arrested after his ex-girlfriend used make-up to allege that he had beaten and raped her

After breaking up with his girlfriend in February last year, Clark asked Gould to move out of his apartment.

However, he was stunned when police arrested him the very next day at his Naval base in Darwin after Kira had complained to officers.

That led to police obtaining a warrant to search his home, and in a bizarre turn of events, they found him in possession of cannabis and a stun gun.

Whilst the rape charges against Clark were dropped, he did plead guilty to holding 0.2mg of the Class B drug along with the weapon and was subsequently fined £190.

Speaking outside of court Clark said: 'It's a pretty weird and twisted web that I got myself into.'

His lawyer told how the weapon and drugs were only discovered by police following the false complaint.

Robert Welfare told the magistrate: '(His ex-girlfriend) put make-up on her eye and went to police and told them she had been raped and bashed.'

He added that police found her claims to be a 'complete fabrication'.

Ms Gould has not faced charges for allegedly making a false statement to the police.
