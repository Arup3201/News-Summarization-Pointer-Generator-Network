It has been almost a decade since the TV show Footballers' Wives left our living rooms, but the OTT bling on the real-life premiership players shows no signs of losing its shine. 

Just yesterday,  Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with his new £260,000 Lamborghini Aventador supercar went viral. 

The 27-year-old footballer was criticised by fans who said the car was ‘undeserved’ given his recent performances on the pitch.
