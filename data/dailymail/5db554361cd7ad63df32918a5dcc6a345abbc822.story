Two black African cardinals emerged as frontrunners for the papacy yesterday after the shock resignation of Benedict XVI.

He became the first leader of the Roman Catholic church to step down in 600 years and the first to abdicate through ill-health.

Amid feverish speculation about the succession, two of the favourites were Ghana’s Cardinal Peter Turkson, 64, and Cardinal Francis Arinze from eastern Nigeria.

The election of a black pope would 
reflect the growing strength of the Catholic church in the developing 
world. But it could be controversial in parts of Eastern Europe where 
racism remains a problem.

Two other contenders, Cardinal Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of San Paolo, 
and the French-Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, would also be a break 
with the tradition of electing only European popes.

Many believe the next pope should come from the developing world – 
particularly Latin America, where Catholicism is the dominant religion, 
or Africa, where the number of followers is growing.

Forty-two per cent of the world’s 1.2billion-strong Catholic population –
 the largest single block – live in Latin America compared to 25 per 
cent in its European heartland.

After the long reign of a Polish pope – John Paul II – and a German 
pope, the Italian Catholic church will put a lot of pressure on 
cardinals to support an Italian for the papacy.

Among its favourites are
 Cardinal Angelo Scola, Archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Angelo 
Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa.

Benedict’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil.

Revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on Sunday, he said 
his ‘strength of mind and body’ had failed in the last few months.

The Vatican denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but
 speculation centred on 85-year-old Benedict’s arthritis problems.

He 
needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in St Peter’s, and it 
is difficult for him to kneel and pray.

Yesterday it emerged that the Pope made his decision to quit last April following a tour of Mexico and Cuba.

The resignation, to take effect on the last day of this month, means a 
conclave of senior cardinals will meet in Rome to choose a successor by 
the end of March.

He sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints.

Some cardinals didn’t understand what Benedict had told them and others 
looked stunned. ‘All the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at 
each other,’ said Monsignor Oscar Sanchez, who was in the room at the 
time.

After the news was announced to the wider world Benedict said in a 
statement: ‘I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an 
advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the 
Petrine ministry (the papacy).

Odilo Scherer, 63, Archbishop of Sao Paolo, is one of the younger contenders for the job

‘In today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by 
questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern 
the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind 
and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has 
deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognise my 
incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.’

A Vatican spokesman admitted: ‘It has taken us by surprise a bit.’

The 
Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said it was ‘a
 bolt from the blue’.

Among those with knowledge of the state of the Pope’s health is his 
brother, Georg, 89. He said yesterday: ‘His age is weighing on him. My 
brother wants more rest.’

The Pope had demanding tours ahead of him, including a visit to Brazil in July for the church’s World Youth Day.

Yesterday he said he intends to live ‘a life dedicated to prayer’.

The Vatican said his immediate future will be spent at Castel Gandolfo, 
the Papal villa south of Rome, and that after his resignation he will 
retreat to a monastery.

Tom Montgomery, a second year seminarian from the diocese of Westminster
 studying at the Vatican said: ‘We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone 
is shocked.

‘But Benedict has been a Pope of surprises. He’s changed from being the 
Cardinal Rottweiler to being a German Shepherd. People said he hadn’t 
the charisma of John Paul. But he is a great teacher. People came to see
 John Paul but they come to hear Ratzinger.’

David Cameron said: ‘His visit to Britain in 2010 is remembered with 
great respect and affection. He will be missed as a spiritual leader to 
millions.’

The last pope to resign was Gregory XII in 1415, who quit reluctantly to end the so-called Great Schism, a period from 1378 when there were two popes – one in Rome and one in Avignon.

Although the right of a pope to resign has been repeatedly enshrined in the laws of the Roman Catholic Church, the fact that none has in 600 years suggests it is only likely in the most testing circumstances.

Popes are expected to serve for life, with Benedict’s predecessor John Paul II carrying on for years during chronic ill-health until his death in 2005.

The first pope to resign was St Pontian, who quit after being sent to the Sardinian salt mines in 230AD by Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax during his persecution of Christians.

Knowing he would not survive the ordeal, Pontian stood down to make way for a successor in 235AD.

Benedict IX was Pope on three separate occasions in the 11th century, thanks to family influence, bribery and manipulation.

He resigned for the last time in 1045, on a promise from his rivals of a woman to marry and gold worth the modern equivalent of £25million. However, the money was never paid.
