Donkey attacks: Tourists have been approached by animals looking for food during their holidays

Tourists have been warned not to feed donkeys in the New
Forest after after a young girl was bitten a day after a nurse was chased and attacked by one.

Holidaymakers visiting a beauty spot in the Hampshire forest have reported being pestered by the animals looking for food.

A 12-year-old girl was nipped as she ran past a man who was being pestered for food by two donkeys at Hatchet Pond near Beaulieu.

Bystanders said the girl screamed and told her father she was bitten by donkeys but was not seriously hurt.

A
 day earlier nurse Jenny Caine was another unfortunate victim and 
dropped her five-year-old daughter Isabelle after being bitten on her 
back and knocked to the ground.

The pair were visiting the same area when they were surrounded by five donkeys as they fed bread to ducks.

Miss Caine, 38, of New Milton, Hampshire, ran away when she was attacked by throwing the bread in the other direction.

She said: ‘We hadn't even got to the water's edge when two donkeys came over and started being a bit of nuisance.

‘Then three others appeared and made a circle around us. I tried to shoo the donkeys away, but 
they kept getting close - nudging me and almost physically moving me 
away from my vehicle.’

She added: ‘Isabelle was getting hysterical, crying and screaming.

‘I
 got up and called for help. I wasn't expecting anyone to put themselves
 at risk but they could have distracted the donkeys or tried to shoo 
them away.

‘I was really angry that no-one did anything. Eventually someone got out of their car and told me to throw my bag of bread in her direction, which I did.

‘The donkeys dispersed and I made a run for it. I was terrified.’

The
 Verderers, the organisation in charge of Forest stock, said people 
feeding ponies and donkeys could result in them becoming aggressive and 
‘demanding’ food.

They have urged people to refrain from feeding the animals and have asked the Forestry Commission rangers to assist them in enforcing the rule at Hatchet Pond.

Spokeswoman Sue Westwood said: ‘As far as I'm aware we have had two incidents now and they are very close together, which is unfortunate.

‘I can't recall any previous incident involving someone in that sort of situation being knocked over by a pony or a donkey.

‘The woman involved was very unlucky.’
