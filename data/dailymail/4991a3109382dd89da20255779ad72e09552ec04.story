Things have gone from bad to worse for Rob Ford, but despite being told   his cancer has a survival rate of only 50 percent, the Toronto mayor said Thursday he's 'going to give it everything I have.'

Ford. 45, has refused to resign from the mayor's office over the diagnosis, even though it comes after numerous scandals including his revelation that he has a long-running crack cocaine addiction.

Visibly weakened by chemotherapy treatments, Ford was at city hall Thursday for a full day's work after attending a debate Wednesday and being spotted at the scene of a fatal crash Tuesday.

Weakened: Chemotherapy treatments had 'knocked the you-know-what' out of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who is battling malignant liposarcoma

'The kids, it's ripping my heart out,' said Ford about his two children, ages 9 and 7, adding that they know exactly what's happening with their father's diagnosis.

'Some nights I just cry myself to sleep, but what can you do, there's only that many tears that can be shed,' he told reporters. 

CBC reports that Ford began chemo treatments in September shortly after doctors found signs of malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen.

The cancer is extremely rare, affecting only about 2.5 people for every million, and doctors say the survival rate is a coin toss. 

He told reporters he 'sees the glass as half full' and that he is taking it 'day to day.'

In spite of his refusal to resign, he dropped his re-election campaign for the mayor's office after his diagnosis and will compete instead for a Toronto city council seat.

Disease: Ford admitted to his constituents that he had a 'disease' since before he became mayor that had him smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor'

His brother, Doug, is running in Ford's place. Doug Ford is currently a Toronto city council member. 

Admitting that cancer 'knocked the you-know-what' out of him, Ford still briefly attended a mayoral debate and said he was up until 3 a.m. making campaign signs. 

Speaking with a hoarse voice, Ford admitted there was criticism for him seeking political office in his condition, but he told those people to 'vote for someone else.'
