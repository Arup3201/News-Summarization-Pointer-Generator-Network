VICTORIA: A LIFE by A. N. Wilson (Atlantic Press, £25) 

Queen Victoria in her wedding dress

As A.N. Wilson notes in his new biography of Queen Victoria: ‘Some human beings change and develop, and that is their strength. For others, strength consists in their incapacity for change.’

Victoria’s character, he argues, remained fixed in its essential qualities throughout her long life.

He believes that the key to her capricious and fascinating nature, which imposed itself so powerfully on the era that bears her name, can be found in her childhood.

The infant Victoria was the product of an unseemly scramble by the sons of George III to produce a legitimate heir to the throne, and it was the Duke of Kent who hit the jackpot when he hastily married a German princess, Victoire.

Having sired a daughter, the Duke expired from a chill in January 1820, leaving his widow and nine-month-old child to the mercy of the English court where they felt like —indeed, were — foreign poor relations.

Victoria firmly believed her childhood was miserable. In 1858 she wrote, ‘I . . . led a very unhappy life as a child — had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection — had no brothers and sisters to live with — never had a father — from my unfortunate circumstances was not on comfortable or at all intimate or confidential footing with my mother — much as I love her now — and did not know what a happy domestic life was.’

This, her biographer crisply points out, is largely nonsense. She had an older half-brother and sister, Prince Charles and Princess Feodore, of whom she was deeply fond, and her mother’s devotion is touchingly evident in a flurry of loving notes on pink paper written to Victoria throughout her childhood.

‘Believe me, my most beloved child, that nobody in this world can love you better than, your true and affectionate Mother’, she wrote on New Year’s Eve 1828.

But as Wilson points out, there are two kinds of unhappy childhood: in one, the child has genuinely suffered. In the other, childhood is an unhappy memory.

The monarch became bitter in her older age and was prone to tantrums

Victoria’s ‘almost unbounded capacity for self-dramatisation and self-pity’, he argues, left her with a strong, unfounded conviction of her wretched early years which led her throughout her life to exhibit the furious egotism of a small child. ‘It was for this reason,’ he writes, ‘that her best friends were servants, or those prepared . . . to behave as if they were servants.’

In old age, her fervent relationships with her bluff Scottish servant, John Brown, and later to Abdul Karim, known as the Munshi, who taught her to say ‘You will miss the Munshi very much’ and ‘Hold me tight’ in Hindustani, would be the cause of scandal and horror among her entourage.

But from the earliest days of her reign, her obstinate wilfulness would repeatedly have grave consequences for the image of the monarchy. On her Coronation day, June 28 1838, the 18-year-old Queen wrote in her diary of her awe at seeing ‘the millions of my loyal subjects who were assembled in every spot to witness the Procession . . . How proud I felt to be the Queen of such a Nation.’

But just two years later she had contrived to make the monarchy a hated institution. Her behaviour in the Bedchamber Affair, when she refused to smooth the sensibilities of a new Tory administration by appointing a Tory Lady of the Bedchamber, convinced the political world that she was a capricious incompetent.

Worse still was her spiteful treatment of her old childhood acquaintance, Lady Flora Hastings. When the unmarried Lady Flora’s waistline began expanding and rumour suggested that she was pregnant, the Queen insisted that she be examined by the royal doctor, Sir James Clark.

The poor woman was a virgin, suffering from a malignant abdominal tumour which killed her in 1839. The public scandal was appalling, but Victoria refused to take it seriously, airily doubting whether the affair was ‘really making such a sensation as people said it did’.

If her public behaviour was outrageous, she was scarcely better in private. Her marriage to Prince Albert was notoriously one of intense attraction and sexual fulfilment, and it produced nine children — all of whom, remarkably, survived, though the youngest, Prince Leopold, suffered from the haemophilia that would become the scourge of the courts of Europe as Victoria’s descendants married into them.

But Victoria was not a doting mother. Some of her children — notably her first-born son, Bertie, the future Edward VII — she frankly disliked, and soon after the marriage of her eldest daughter, Vicky, she wrote: ‘I cannot tell you how happy I am that you are not in an unenviable position [pregnant]. Though I quite admit the comfort and blessing good and amiable children are — they are also an awful plague and anxiety for which they show one so little gratitude very often! What made me so miserable was to have the first two years of my married life utterly spoilt by this occupation!’

Even the adored Albert was not immune from her frightful tantrums. In 1857 he wrote her a pained note: ‘I don’t yet know why my question . . . “What makes you so bitter?” produced such an outburst . . . I am trying to keep out of your way until . . . you have regained control of yourself .’

Victoria’s mourning after Albert’s untimely death in December 1861 (for which she partly blamed the hapless Bertie) plunged her still deeper into self-absorption, from which she was rescued by her passion for one of the Balmoral ghillies — John Brown. ‘[He] is devoted to me,’ wrote the Queen. ‘So simple, so intelligent, so unlike an ordinary servant’.

The Queen's stubborn nature was her defining characteristic

Indeed he was not. Prone to bawling the Queen’s orders in his broad Scots accent, he was fond of whisky, and the Queen developed a taste for a deadly concoction of claret mixed with whisky.

So extravagant was her mourning when Brown died in 1883 that rumour circulated that they had been married.

Wilson finds striking evidence in the testimony of a retired clergyman that this may have been the case, and concludes that their 20-year relationship was certainly a ‘marriage’ in emotional terms — though he doesn’t commit himself on the question of whether it was formally solemnised or consummated.

Wilson is affectionately alert to the rich contradictions of his subject’s personality, and his deliciously readable biography becomes increasingly fascinating as Victoria’s reign unfolds.

The brilliance of his writing is especially striking in the final pages, when he lists the extraordinary quantity of stuff Victoria wanted to be buried with: an entire jumble-sale of mementoes, including Brown’s handkerchief and his mum’s wedding ring.

‘Parents who put a certain type of imaginative child to bed find they are unable to do so without adding . . . so many things crammed into the bedding that it is hard to know where the child will find to sleep,’ Wilson writes.

It is an extraordinary perception: the unspeakably grand octogenarian Queen-Empress, monarch for 63 years, laid to her final rest like the vulnerable small child she once was.
