A mother of two yesterday accused road rage killer Tracie Andrews of stealing her husband.

Linsie Goldsworthy says Andrews started an affair with her husband Phil, 53, after meeting him in the pub where they both worked.

She claims to have caught them out when he accidentally sent her a text on their 24th wedding anniversary that was meant for Andrews.

Mrs Goldsworthy, 48, said: ‘That woman has stolen my husband from me. He is besotted with her.

‘I think she deliberately targeted him and knew he was married. He denied having an affair but he has told me a lot of lies.’

Andrews, 43, was released on licence 
in January after serving 14 years of a life sentence for killing her 
fiancé Lee Harvey, 25, in a frenzied knife attack near Alvechurch, 
Worcestershire in 1996.

At a notorious press conference she had claimed he was killed in a road rage attack by a motorist who had ‘staring eyes’.

But she was later convicted of 
murdering Mr Harvey, a bus driver. She stabbed him 37 times and slashed 
his throat before leaving him to bleed to death.

While in prison she dyed her hair black and had £5,000 worth of surgery on the NHS to correct her protruding jaw.

Caged: Tracie at the High Court, where she appealed against her murder conviction

Grief: Lee Harvey's parents, Maureen and Ray Harvey, campaigned to keep their son's murderer behind bars

Andrews met Mr Goldsworthy after 
moving to a picturesque South West coastal town and getting a job as a 
barmaid in a local pub using a new name.

Despite her new name and appearance 
Mrs Goldsworthy said her husband, the pub’s bouncer, soon learned who 
she was. She said: ‘He was fascinated by her. If we went out with 
friends he would say excitedly, “Guess who’s working at the pub? The 
woman who stabbed her boyfriend to death”.

‘He would defend her from any 
criticism, claiming she had changed. He used to say she looked like Kat 
Slater from EastEnders – and he has always fancied her. Then he started 
coming home from the pub at 4am, claiming they were getting really busy.
 He began to change and went off sex, saying I was too fat.’

Mrs Goldsworthy claims to have tried 
to have saved her marriage but walked out of the family home they shared
 with son Michael 16, and daughter Jodie, 20. She now suffers depression
 and lives in a small flat with only her terrier-cross for company.

Mr Goldsworthy has denied having an affair with Andrews. ‘That is untrue,’ he said. ‘My missus knows that isn’t true.’
