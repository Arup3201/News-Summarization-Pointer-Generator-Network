A breast cancer surgeon who botched operations on 35 women, leaving many disfigured and in pain, has finally been struck off the medical register.

Consultant Puvan Markandoo, 64, was stopped from working privately three years ago after a series of complaints.

But although the General Medical Council found failings in 11 aspects of her work, she was allowed to carry on working on NHS patients under supervision.

Botched: Patients at Barnsley Hospital in South Yorkshire had complained of pain, injury and disfigurement after surgery between 2005 and 2008

Now, after a second GMC investigation, the Malaysian-born surgeon, who qualified as a doctor 34 years ago, has been stopped from working altogether.

Female patients at Barnsley Hospital in South Yorkshire had complained of pain, injury and disfigurement after surgery between 2005 and 2008.

A group of victims have now received £1.2million in compensation from the hospital.

The GMC has ended Miss Markandoo's career after a report showed she had 'an exceptionally poor standard of medical knowledge and skills'.

A 'fitness to practice' panel in Manchester heard that medical assessors checking her performance last October decided she had got worse since 2007.

Victim: Diane Greenman was one of the many women who suffered botched breast operations

Panel chairman Patrick Conway told her: 'They indicated that your performance was so poor that it did not reach the level of a newly-qualified doctor.

'The panel has serious concerns about the wide-ranging and basic deficiencies in your medical knowledge and clinical skills.'

He added: 'The panel has received overwhelming evidence that you demonstrated unsafe practice during your performance assessment and that you would be a risk to patients if you were to resume clinical practice.'

Sheila Jeffrey, 54, from Cudworth, near Barnsley, who was permanently scarred after breast surgery, said : 'It is a disgrace it has taken so long to ban her, but I am pleased she cannot hurt anyone else.

'I wonder how many people she has hurt in the meantime.

'They could have been spared the pain and agony, physically and mentally, if they had acted the first time.

'What was the intelligence behind letting that woman continue to work?'

She said the consultant had ruined her life.

'I am still in a lot of pain and take painkillers every day. It is a pity she was not struck off before.'
