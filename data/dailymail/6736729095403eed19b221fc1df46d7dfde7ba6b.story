A Florida man has spoken of how he managed to pry himself free from the clutches of a large bear after he was attacked in his front yard last night.

Josh Hennessy, 36, was sitting on a folding chair under an awning outside his father's trailer in the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento about 9.30pm Thursday.

When he heard rustling in the bushes, he went to investigate.

'I actually saw a shadow go by the side of my face,' he told Click Orlando.

Victim Josh Hennessy explains during a TV interview how he managed to escape a bear that attacked him at the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento

Hennessey suffered cuts and scrapes on his hand, arm, hip and leg, but he was not seriously injured

Photos of Josh Hennessy's injuries were posted on Facebook by his wife Courtney Allstead-Hennessy

If confirmed, the attack would be the second in Central Florida since December

Hennessy claims this to be a bite mark from the bear that attacked him. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are investigating

Spike in bear-nuisance complaints: Florida's bear hotline had 6,700 complaints in 2013 - the most ever. Seen here is a black bear spotted in the backyard of a home in Holly Hills, Florida

'(I) kind of looked over (and) thought it was somebody walking through the yard (and) I just wanted to go over and see who it was real quick because I don't really like people in the yard.

'As soon as I got into the dark, he just came out at me.  It was a black bear, so I didn't see it until he was there.'

Hennessey said he wrestled the bear, which dragged him out into the street.

Luckily he fought it off.

Hennessey had cuts and scrapes on his hand, arm, hip and leg - mostly from being dragged on the road - but was not seriously injured.

His father Rick Hennessy, 59, drove him to hospital.

His wife, Courtney Allstead-Hennessy, 33, posted photos of the injuries on her Facebook page.

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officials could not immediately verify that account

'We don't really know what happened yet,' agency spokesman Greg Workman said.

Scene: Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento, Florida

Hennessy says he was sitting on this porch when the bear attack occurred

Officers searched the area with flashlights and set a bear trap near where the attack occurred.

Resident Mike Henslee said he was not surprised to hear of the attack, adding that at least four bears live near the community and 'a bunch of idiots out here' feed them.

'We see bears here all the time,' Henslee told The Orlando Sentinel.

'A big boy was in our garbage two nights ago.'

If confirmed, the attack would be the second in Central Florida since December, when a Seminole County woman was seriously hurt in the worst recorded mauling in state history.

Susan Chalfant, 54, was walking her dogs near Longwood December 2 when a mother bear, accompanied by her cubs, bit her on the head, face and neck.

Josh Hennessy, 36, had only been living with his father for one month at the mobile home park before the attack occurred

The mauling happened amid a spike in bear-nuisance complaints in Central Florida and led wildlife officials to ask the Legislature for more money to tackle the problem.

Florida's bear hotline had 6,700 complaints in 2013, the most ever.

The majority of them came from Central Florida.

Bears have been spotted in or near Apopka, Lake Mary, Umatilla, DeLand and DeBary.

Shy by nature, they have become bolder in neighborhoods where they have found trash, pet food and birdseed to eat.
