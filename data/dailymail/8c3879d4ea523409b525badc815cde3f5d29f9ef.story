The value of Bitcoins has plummeted by half following Chinese restrictions on exchanges in the virtual currency.

BTC China, a Bitcoin and Yuan trading platform, announced that local payment companies have been blocked from providing it with clearing services.

This means that the firm can no longer accept yuan-based deposits.

The value of Bitcoins has plummeted following Chinese restrictions on exchanges in the virtual currency.

One Bitcoin was trading for as low as 2,560 yuan (£258), according to the South China Morning Post. At its peak in late November a Bitcoin sold for 7,588 yuan (£764).

The measures reflect growing concern 
by authorities that the cybercurrency, which is created, distributed and
 authenticated independently of any bank or government, could pose a 
viable alternative to China's tightly controlled yuan, which is not 
freely convertible.

The relative anonymity of Bitcoins holds out the promise of being able to spend money across the internet without scrutiny.

The value of Bitcoins also plunged 
earlier this month after the Chinese government questioned the legal 
status of the virtual currency.

A
 joint statement from several Chinese official bodies such as the 
People's Bank of China said Bitcoins are not a currency and cannot be 
used as a form of payment by any businesses or financial institutions.

Virtual currency exchanges in China are not overseen by the country's central bank, so they are reliant on independent clearing houses to act as go-betweens.

'We essentially got notice from our third-party provider today that they will discontinue accepting payments for us and new deposits,' Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, told the South China Morning Post.

A statement from the exchange added that account holders can still top up their accounts using Bitcoins and withdraw yuan, but has had to 'temporarily stop its yuan account recharging functions'.

'BTC China will continue to operate. Please continue to monitor our website, we will try to offer another way to recharge," it said.

Despite wild swings in value, the cybercurrency has been moving toward broader acceptance, with a growing number of companies accepting Bitcoins, which can be converted into cash.

'A lot of people put Bitcoin's rise over recent months to China where interest in it has gone through the roof,' Emily Spaven, editor of digital currency news site CoinDesk told the BBC.

'People are getting frightened that with
 the new regulations the country could now drop out of the ecosystem. 
Going forward, it's certainly not the end of Bitcoin, but people have 
been panic selling.'

Today it was also reported that European banking watchdogs have warned British savers they are at risk of losing their money if they put their cash in unofficial digital currencies such as Bitcoins.

The European Banking Authority advised savers to be careful before joining in the Bitcoin bonanza, saying buyers risk having their money raided from laptops by hackers and that the value of these currencies can be subject to wild swings.

In addition, buyers have no protection if the currency collapses or an online business that promises to store their currency fails.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

Yesterday the Norwegian government announced that is does not count as real money.

'Bitcoins don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency,' Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, said.

Instead, Norway will classify Bitcoins as an asset, subject to capital gains tax.

'We’ve done some assessments on what’s the right and sound way to handle this in the tax system,' he added.

The virtual currency has left governments throughout the world scratching their heads as it is not controlled by a government or any central bank.
