Women have a different friend for each occasion and whether it's a patient Agony Aunt, a sassy Samantha-a-like (from Sex And The City) or a no-nonsense Shopping Buddy, they are all important wing women for different aspects of our lives.

The Shopping Buddy is ruthless. She doesn't beat around the bush, has serious stamina, a good eye for design and a very flexible credit card. You can always rely on her to give you honest feedback when trying clothes on and she trusts you to do the same.

Every woman has a Childhood Favourite, Samantha and Nigella in their lives... as well as a Plan B

You make an excellent tag team when going into the sales, grabbing things off the rail you know the other person would like. What's more, you know her measurements like your own. 

The Agony Aunt - or the Wise One - is often one of your older friends, a mother figure who you can talk to about stuff you wouldn't want your mother to know.  She has had more life experience than you and is always willing to talk if you have a problem - just make sure you don't do it too often or you will be seen as our next archetype...

The Crybaby only calls for a whinge. You let this friend cry on your shoulder once when one of her many relationships ended, now you are the default agony aunt to all her problems.

Expect to have a fun time with your Samantha, but beware, she never knows when enough is enough

She rings at the most inconvenient 
hours, usually either from the loos at work or last thing at night after she's had a few too many glasses of wine.

Everyone knows a Samantha. Immortalised by Kim Catrall in Sex and the City, she does anything, says anything and is, at the best of times, a loose cannon. She's great to go out with in the evenings and you can always expect to have a fun time with her - but beware, she never knows when enough is enough.

If you are always the one hosting the dinner parties or inviting your friends round to see your new home improvements then you are The Nigella.

This domestic goddess cooks, cleans and always looks immaculate and boy, do her friends know about it. We are all a little bit jealous of our Nigella friends but they can still be relied upon for a fun evening and fantastic cooking.

The Friend Of A Friend is a person you have met a couple of times and, you're friends on Facebook - other than that there is little else. You don't really have anything in common other than a mutual acquaintance and if you by chance bump into each other in the street, the conversation is extremely limited and quite awkward - especially if you've forgotten their name.

The Married With Kids friend is someone who you used to have real fun with until they tied the knot. Now there's no more nights on the town, all you ever do is 'coffee at mine on Saturdays' and conversation is limited to what her kids are up to. Of course you don't resent her getting married and starting a family, you just want a bit of your old friend back.

8. Plan B

9. All Seeing Eye

10. Childhood Favourite

The Plan B is a friend everyone hates to admit they have. They're ready to fill a gap when a better friend can't make a night out.

The All Seeing Eye friend is the ultimate queen of gossip. She will know other peoples' business well before they do and won't be afraid to hold her tongue.

You go to her when you want the latest scoop however, you are careful of how much of your own news you let her have.

She often gives the impression of being loyal to you, but when news starts spreading about you and that guy you met the other night, you probably know where it has come from.

Of course, on the list compiled through research by PromotionalCodes.org.uk, there is also the Childhood Favourite, your most trusted friend, who you are able to do anything with, 
whether that's going out for a night on the town or hitting the shops.

You
will have known her for at least five years (but probably for much 
longer), her number will be on your speed-dial and more than likely 
you will be bridesmaids for each other.
