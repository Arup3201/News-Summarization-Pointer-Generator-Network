Bobby Brown's sister allegedly smacked her son in the head with a bottle during a hotel fight after the family gathered in Atlanta to be at his daughter Bobbi Kristina's hospital bedside.

Tina Brown hit Shayne Brown in the head with a bottle at the bar of the W. Midtown Atlanta Hotel early on Friday, according to an Atlanta Police report.

Shayne Brown then drove himself to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for lacerations to the side of the head, while Tina Brown took off before police arrived, according to the report.

The police report noted that the family had been at a birthday party for Bobby Brown - who turned 46 on Thursday - when the mother and son started arguing over a valet parking ticket.

'Mr Brown stated that while arguing with his mother, she spit in his face and hit him on his head with a glass bottle,' the report noted. 

According to TMZ, she took a swing at him when Shayne called his mother a 'crackhead'.

He told police he did not want to press charges against his mother.

The fight erupted after Bobby Brown celebrated his birthday on Thursday at Ocean Prime restaurant in Atlanta with as many as 20 friends and family,E! Online reported.  

Brown, who looked tired as he arrived, was escorted to a private dining area that was sectioned off by a curtain. He was joined by his pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge and their son Cassius, five. 

Despite the tragedy that has befallen the family this week, there was a party atmosphere, E! reported. Brown was lavished with presents, two birthday cakes and a rendition of 'Happy Birthday'.

The restaurant, which is in the upscale neighborhood of Buckhead, serves celebratory dishes including $49 twin lobster tails, Chilean sea bass with a truffle sauce for $43 and steaks for $48.

Members of the Brown family have been gathering in Atlanta after Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive in a bathtub at her Roswell home last weekend - in a tragedy that eerily shadows the death of her mother, Whitney Houston, in 2012. 

The 21-year-old, who was reportedly found by her partner Nick Gordon and a friend, is currently in a medically-induced coma at Emory University Hospital.

Although the family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, on Thursday, one of her cousins revealed that doctors do not believe she will improve.

'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers

'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' 

His message is one of the first family insights into Bobbi's condition since she was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday and put in a medically-induced coma. She is now at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. 

On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off.

'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said.

It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn.

On Friday, TMZ reported that was refusing to take his daughter off life support - despite doctor's advice - because he believes in 'God-driven miracles'.

Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the life support claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter.

'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday.

'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.'  

The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'.

On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported.

'We're praying,' he added. 

Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home.

'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website.

'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' 

Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.'

'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.'

Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances.

Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned.

Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning.

Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. 

Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR.

On Friday, the attorney for the friend who found Bobbi Kristina said he went looking for her when a cable guy turned up at the door. When she didn't respond to his knocks, he went inside the bathroom.

'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Max's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.'

Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon.

Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon as a child. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship.

Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media.

But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.'

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC.

Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.
