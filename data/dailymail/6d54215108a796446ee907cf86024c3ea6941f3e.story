A mother has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for assaulting a teacher, a principal and cafeteria worker at her son's school after being told she needed a visitor's badge to see him.

Jessica Smallwood, 25, from Akron, Ohio, was sentenced to 14 months on Tuesday after she pleaded guilty to three counts of assault that were felonies because they involved educators.

Smallwood had gone to Glover Elementary School on February 21 to escort her seven-year-old son - who had had trouble with bullies in the past - to breakfast, The Akron Beacon Journal reported.

But when she entered the cafeteria, she was approached by Principal Nancy Ritch, who told her she needed a visitor's badge to be there.

She became annoyed and started arguing with Ritch and a teacher. She cursed at them before pushing the teacher and knocking the principal to the ground, police said.

She then hit a cafeteria worker who had intervened, police said.

During the incident - which her seven-year-old special needs son witnessed - the elementary school was placed on lockdown. The boy also saw his mother being led away in handcuffs by police.

The principal suffered head injuries in the melee and was treated by paramedics at the scene.

Smallwood's sister, Jennifer Smallwood, told the Beacon Journal after the incident that it didn't add up because the mother is a well-known parent who walked her son to his classroom every day.

She added that her sister had often met with school officials to talk about her son being bullied and would sometimes sit with him during breakfast.

After Smallwood was sentenced to prison on Tuesday, her attorney said she was upset and shocked by the sentence. He said he will seek early release from prison later this year.

Smallwood has a past conviction for trafficking marijuana and attempted tampering with evidence in 2011 but she has never served time in prison, the Beacon Journal reported.

Her son is being cared for by family members.
