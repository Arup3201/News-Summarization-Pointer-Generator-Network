The callousness of metal thieves has hit new depths with the theft of a memorial to two children murdered by the IRA.

Last night the father of one of the victims expressed his ‘utter disgust’ at the ‘despicable’ crime.

Colin Parry denounced the heartless thieves who stole the plaque commemorating the 1993 Warrington bombings, which killed his son Tim, 12, and another child, three-year-old Johnathan Ball.

The death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and Mr Parry received an OBE for his  peace campaigning after the atrocity. 

Father's anguish: Colin Parry and his son on holiday, a year before Tim was killed at the age of 12. The plaque (right) put up in memory of Tim and the other victim Johnathan Ball, 3, has been stolen by scrap metal thieves

Police say the A3-size plaque could have been sold for scrap for as little as £30. It is the latest in a series of abhorrent thefts of memorials by criminals exploiting the soaring value of scrap metal.

War memorials, lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted. Each year, at least 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen, worth an estimated of £800million.

Last night Mr Parry – who received an OBE for his active role in the Peace Process after the bombings – said: ‘It makes me feel utter disgust and it is reprehensible that someone should disfigure what is a memorial to two young boys and see it as something they can make money from without any consideration for the families who lost loved ones.

‘It beggars belief that people can be so heartless and I don’t expect that they have any conscience.

‘It is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting.’

The Warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in February 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the Cheshire town.

In the second attack, The Samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in Liverpool.

In the event, there were two blasts, in litter bins outside Boots and Argos, within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion.

Johnathan Ball was killed almost instantly and Tim Parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine.

More than 50 other victims were injured, with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass.

The bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren.

Mr Parry, 65, a human resources consultant, said of the thieves: ‘Even if they are really hard up it is without any justification.

‘It really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters.

‘It leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in, in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered. They did not give a moments thought to the significance of what they had just stolen. It is despicable.’

His wife Wendy, 54, said: ‘It’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind. Tim and Johnathan had so much to live for and I wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought.

‘It is a sign of the times, I suppose, but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day.’

The bombings triggered a campaign for peace, with Mr and Mrs Parry – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between Britain and Ireland.

They set up a Peace Centre in the town and played an active role in the Peace Process in Northern Ireland, for which Mr Parry was given his OBE in 2004.

Tragically, the parents of Johnathan Ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast. Johnathan’s father, Wilf Ball, 69, died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days.

The boy’s mother, Marie Comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart.

Stolen: This is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the IRA blast was placed. Police are today hunting for the people who took it

The bronze plaque, which depicts the course of the River Mersey as it flows through the Borough of Warrington, reads: ‘The central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in Bridge Street in 1993.  Young people helped the artist with the design work.’

Helen Jones, Labour MP for Warrington North, said: ‘This is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other Warrington people who were injured in the bombing.

‘Warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it didn’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace. But these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves.’

David Mowat, Conservative MP for Warrington South, said: ‘I am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped.’

Liz Antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance Gordon Edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb.

They suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim Tim Parry’s mother, Wendy.

Yesterday Mrs Edwards, 40, said: ‘It’s awful, absolutely awful and I don’t know why someone would want to do something like that. It is irrelevant that it happened so long ago because the events on March 20 1993 still have an impact today.’

Resident Amy Edwards, 34, said: ‘This is one of the most shaming crimes. They are nothing but sick vultures who have no respect.’

Yesterday PC Graham Davies, of Cheshire Police, said: ‘This plaque forms part of a memorial and is of great significance to the town.’

He urged scrap metal dealers who may have information or may have been approached to buy the plaque to contact police immediately.
