Voices are raised and staff try to civily resolve the issue as other diners are clearly distressed by the situation.

Then a small push sets off the brawl where fists fly, chairs are smashed over heads and tables are thrown while customers duck for cover.

When the fight is brought under control, the men are escorted out the door while an amused patrons asks: 'Do I get a refund on my souvlaki?'.

A representative from the restaurant said the fight took place over five years ago.

'A video has been posted on you tube today- this is a situation that happened over 5 years ago and all the people involved were dealt with by the police and it was in the media at the time,' it said on their Facebook page.
