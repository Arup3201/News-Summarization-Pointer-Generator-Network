A man with a three-litre-a-day cola habit drank himself to death, an inquest heard yesterday.

Paul
Inman, 30, of Haworth, West Yorkshire, would go out to buy the fizzy 
drink up to three times a day - and would also down glasses of water to 
quench his apparent thirst.

But
the huge quantities of cola and other drinks caused his lungs to swell 
to four times the normal weight and the Asperger Syndrome sufferer died 
in his sleep, the Bradford hearing was told.

Flat: Paul Inman, 30, who lived at this care home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, would go out to buy the fizzy drink up to three times a day - and would also down glasses of water to quench his apparent thirst

Mr Inman lived in a flat at Three 
Sisters Care Home in Haworth, where he was found dead in his bedroom by 
care worker Becky Earwaker, who was checking on him one morning in March
2012.

He was 
discovered face down on his bed with his glasses folded by his side, but
had seemed well when staff saw him going into his room the night 
before. He usually locked his door but had not.

Detectives who went to investigate the sudden death found there were no suspicious circumstances.

Mr
Inman never stayed still and care staff had to keep his cigarettes so 
he would not smoke 20 an hour. He would pace up and down continually and
could go through two pairs of trainers a week.

When he was 17, Mr Inman was 
diagnosed with schizophrenia but when his case was reviewed in 2008 
doctors then diagnosed that he suffered from Asperger Syndrome - a form 
of autism.

Six months before his death he moved to 
the Haworth home - where he was extremely happy, said his mother Alison 
Inman, who attended the hearing with his father David.

A
post-mortem examination found that Mr Inman's lungs were three to four 
times the weight they should have been, pathologist Dr Deirdre Mckenna 
said.

She ruled out the cause of that being 
epilepsy and a heart attack and put it down instead to his excessive 
drinking with the root of that habit stemming from him being an Asperger
sufferer.

He was already known to have had low sodium levels because of the volume of fluids that he drank.

Addressing assistant deputy Bradford 
Coroner Dr Domninic Bell, Mrs Inman said after hearing Dr McKenna's 
report: ‘I'm not a pathologist but I made that decision two hours after 
he died.

‘I've said all this time the cause of it was he drank excessively, absolutely excessively.

'He had done since he was ten years old. We used to say he had a self-destruct button.’

Dr Bell recorded a verdict that Mr Inman had died of natural causes.
