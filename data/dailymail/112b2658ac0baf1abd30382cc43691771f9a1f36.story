Patients are dying on the operating table while undergoing a common type of hip replacement, the former chief medical officer has warned.

A study carried out by Professor Liam Donaldson found at least 41 deaths in seven years have been directly linked to the use of chemical ‘cement’ in the procedure.

The substance is a form of transparent glue used in more than half of partial hip replacements, where patients have fractured the top of the femur.

Procedure: The risk of death from a hip transplant is 1 in 3,000 - but the frequency seems to be increasing

Although the risk of death or harm is low - 1 in every 3,000 operations – the frequency appears to be increasing. Only one death was reported in 2005, rising to seven in 2007 and to 16 by 2012.

While this may partly be down to better recording, Professor Donaldson and his team are concerned that as the population ages, more patients will be at risk.

Around 22,000 patients undergo the procedure every year, and surgeons often use cement to ensure the new joint is properly attached to the patient’s bone.

But Professor Donaldson and his colleagues at Imperial College London believe that in some instances, chemicals from the cement enter the blood stream and disturb the heart rhythm.

In others, surgeons may be pushing the cement into the joint too forcibly, dislodging a ball of fat which enters the blood stream and blocks one of the main arteries.

Operation: 22,000 people have hip replacements every year, and cement is used in many of the operations

In a study published in the British Medical Journal, they analysed safety incidents reported by hospitals in England and Wales from 2005 to 2012. They established that 41 deaths from heart attacks had occurred as a result of hip replacements over that time.

In nearly all cases the attack  happened on the operating table. They also found a further 21 cases where patients had suffered severe heart attacks but survived.

Professor Donaldson, who was the chief medical officer for England from 1998 to 2010, said: ‘Cement tends to be the main method for inserting hips in the UK. In other countries such as Canada it isn’t used at all.’

He added: ‘[Patient death] is caused by one of two things. Some chemical enters the blood and disturbs the heart rhythm.

'The other is that when the cement is pushed into the marrow of the bone it causes a fat embolism, a ball of fat enters the blood stream and that gets lodged in one of the main arteries. The death often comes almost immediately.’

He urged surgeons to monitor safety guidelines which instruct them to check patients’ hearts before they have the operation.

Additionally, he said they needed to have a ‘serious look’ at whether patients really needed to have cement – especially if they were at high risk of having a heart attack.

Doctor Paul Rutter, another of the researchers, said: ‘The risk is not enormous but it’s significant enough that we should try to understand and take account of it.

‘Bone cement implantation syndrome happens and it’s killing people in the UK.

‘It’s rare but it’s not extremely rare. There are measures that anaesthetists and surgeons can take to prevent this happening. Our study clearly shows an ongoing issue that has not yet been wholly addressed by research.’

The alert comes on the back of a study from the US which showed that the total number of hip replacements doubled between 1993 and 2009. The rise is believed to be a result of an increasingly overweight population.
