Hello to Louis van Gaal, goodbye to the Manchester United we have known for a lifetime.

In the same way Liverpool’s ‘boot room’ culture was consigned to the past when Gerard Houllier arrived in 1998, some of the traditions and methods that, for so long, were part of United’s fabric will no longer mean what they did.

The appointment of Van Gaal, the first foreign manager to rule at Old Trafford, now means they will be susceptible to the issues and changes that impacted on all other clubs in the Barclays Premier League while United, under Sir Alex Ferguson, dominated.

Now don’t get me wrong — I’m not criticising United’s selection of Van Gaal. He comes with an outstanding pedigree and enters our game on the back of a tremendous summer when he led Holland to third place at the World Cup. He knows what he wants and isn’t afraid to speak his mind.

Clearly, it is going to be his way and his alone. He may have chosen Ryan Giggs to be his assistant and provide a link to the glorious past but a number of Van Gaal’s blunt comments illustrate how things are going to be so different at United.

First he was critical about the balance of the squad — could you imagine David Moyes saying that 12 months ago about the one he inherited from Ferguson? — and he would have left board members squirming when attacking the scheduling of their lucrative United States tour.

Another bone of contention revolves around Luke Shaw. He, like Ander Herrera, is what you would describe as being a ‘United signing’ rather than a Van Gaal purchase. United scouted Shaw more than a dozen times last season and he was joining this summer regardless of who was manager.

United spent £30million to land England’s future long-term left back, but Van Gaal has called him unfit and has been tracking Sporting Lisbon’s Marcos Rojo and Ajax’s Daley Blind, a player he knows inside out. Both can play in Shaw’s position.

Issues such as these can cause tension behind the scenes.

Then there was his complaint about Carrington, United’s training base, being ‘too exposed to wind’ —an issue that hasn’t been raised in public during the previous 14 years they had been there. But this is how he will put his stamp on the facility, along with two new Desso pitches — at a cost of £800,000 — to replicate exactly Old Trafford’s surface.

Something similar happened at Melwood when Houllier came in. He made the pitches at Melwood exactly the same measurements and the same feel as Anfield. There were wooden shooting boards dotted around the field, which had been used daily since they were brought in by Bill Shankly, but Houllier removed them all. He banned mobile phones, too.

Houllier arrived on the back of helping France win the 1998 World Cup and Phil Thompson and Sammy Lee, European Cup winners who cherished the boot-room philosophy, had their eyes opened to what traditionalists viewed as radical changes. They embraced the innovation.

When Rafa Benitez followed in 2004, coming with a c.v. that included two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup with Valencia, he did things his own way too, paying no heed to what Houllier had done. More changes were made to Melwood, including the installation of a steep running hill.

Benitez was single-minded and different in so many ways to Houllier. When he was trying to explain how a situation might unfold in a game, he used to physically move players around the pitch, pushing and pulling them into positions.

New methods could take you aback. Occasionally we would think to ourselves ‘that can’t be right’ as Houllier and Benitez tried to get their points across but, even if you didn’t agree with them, you would not think twice about doing what they said, as they had a c.v. to back up their actions.

That is exactly what it will be like for United’s players with Van Gaal. Even if they doubt him, they will feel compelled to follow him. There will be no uncertainty, unlike the situation with David Moyes, who appeared caught between doing things his own way and trying to respect United’s heritage.

Tradition demands United play with flying wingers. Ferguson did it, Ron Atkinson and Sir Matt Busby did it, but Van Gaal is going to dispense with that system for the time being and opt to go with three central defenders.

I admire managers who get the most out of the squads they have to work with; Van Gaal doesn’t have a winger of Angel di Maria’s quality, so playing three at the back allows his three best attackers — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata — to play in their best, central positions.

After a number of good results during pre-season, culminating in the 2-1 success against Valencia on Tuesday, has allowed optimism to build. But I don’t see how a change in formation and two signings will catapult them back to the top.

In 16 seasons at club level, Van Gaal — who has won seven league titles — has finished outside the top three on just three occasions, but his aim will be to get United into the Champions League. I expect a strong challenge for the top four but, to get there, they still need two quality defensive additions.

As a target, that is at odds with everything United have strived for over the past two decades. But these are changing times — and nothing shows that more than the man who will oversee matters against Swansea this lunchtime.

I'm hoping for another colossus like Kompany 

During the middle of the best World Cup we have seen for a long time, I lamented the lack of top-class defenders who are operating in the world game now.

While it was terrific to see so many countries engage attack and look to score so many goals, I just felt there was something missing — a standout display, the kind we used to get from Franco Baresi, Jurgen Kohler and Marcel Desailly.

Players of that ilk, though, are few and far between and that has been shown by the fact that Barcelona and Manchester United, two giants of the game, were scraping to sign Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal. He is a good defender but he couldn’t displace Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker.

We all loved seeing so many goals at the World Cup and, of course, we will want to see the new Barclays Premier League campaign lit up with the same kind of entertainment and flair, but I would also like to see some top-class defensive displays, too.

I have made my admiration for Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany clear on these pages before.

He continues to set the standard, so it will be fascinating to see how Eliaquim Mangala fares alongside him after his £32million move from FC Porto. Liverpool have spent big on Dejan Lovren and Manchester United will continue looking for a big addition until the transfer window closes.

Coaches always know that looking after the back is as important, if not more, than what happens up front.

My excitement at the start of the new campaign is the same as I felt when I was a young lad growing up and, all being well, the action will be just as good as last year. Chelsea and Manchester City are the teams to beat in the title race but there are so many other strands to follow. So…

I'm keeping an eye on...

How teams cope with using three at the back. That system seems in vogue, with a number of sides getting ready to use it, but how long will it stay that way? It will be interesting to see what the teams do if results start going against them.

I'm looking forward to... 

Seeing Diego Costa go to war with central defenders. With Luis Suarez gone, Chelsea’s £32million summer signing from Atletico Madrid looks the most likely candidate to take my old team-mate’s role of top goalscorer — and chief villain.

I've got big hopes for... 

James Ward-Prowse. The Southampton midfielder has been the subject of good reports and I know he was the standout player when England’s Under 20s played in Toulon this summer.

If the 19-year-old progresses, he could be pushing for the senior squad at some point.
