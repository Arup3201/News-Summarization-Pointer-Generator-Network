The two-year-old daughter of one of 
Britain’s wealthiest men was found by the family’s nanny hanging from a 
window blind cord next to her cot, an inquest was told yesterday.

Alexandra Lucy Hoegh, the daughter of 
shipping tycoon Morten Hoegh, was found suspended from the cord of a 
roller blind on the top floor of the family’s £12million five-storey 
home in West London.

Westminster Coroner’s Court heard that
the ‘tragic and appalling’ death occurred when the toddler became 
entangled in the beaded cord, which was within her reach, on October 29 
last year.

The ‘happy, healthy young girl’ died three weeks before her third birthday.

Mr Hoegh, 39, the chairman of multi- 
billion-pound oil and gas shipping company Hoegh LNG, with an estimated 
personal fortune of £175million, attended court yesterday with his wife.

The businessman was out of the country at the time of his daughter’s death.

Alexandra had been taken to her 
bedroom for a nap at 1pm by Andrea De La Cruz, a Filipino nanny who 
shared her duties with her daughter Melinda.

Mrs De La Cruz left Alexandra in her cot looking at books and went downstairs to do some washing.

She could hear the toddler talking to 
herself through the baby monitor and assumed that, when everything went 
quiet at 1.30pm, she had fallen asleep.

Tragedy: The two-year-old daughter of shipping magnate Morten Hoegh, left, was found dead at the family home last October. The increase in the number of deaths involving 
blind cords similar to this one has led to campaigners calling on them 
to be banned

But when her daughter went to wake the toddler an hour later, she found her hanging lifeless in her cot and ‘panicked’.

Melinda sobbed as she told the inquest: ‘I saw Alexandra standing up in the corner of her crib with the cord around her neck.’

Screaming, she carried Alexandra’s 
limp body down the stairs and placed her in the arms of her distraught 
mother Dana, who was having lunch with a friend, Catherine Mathiesen.

Mrs Hoegh, 37, ran out on to the street ‘crying hysterically’ and tried 
desperately to resuscitate her daughter on the pavement, to no avail.

Mrs Mathiesen called an ambulance but 
was so distressed it took her a couple of minutes to describe what had 
happened and give a coherent account.

Two ambulances arrived nine minutes later and paramedics found Mrs Hoegh cradling her daughter on the pavement.

Detective Sergeant Kevin Harwin, who 
also arrived at the scene, said Mrs Hoegh was ‘crying hysterically’ and 
Mrs Mathiesen was ‘collapsing and retching’.

‘All parties were in a serious state of shock’, he added.

Paramedics tried to resuscitate 
Alexandra but she was pronounced dead shortly after her arrival at St 
Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.

Forensic pathologist Professor Anthony
Risdon, who conducted the post-mortem examination, said Alexandra had a
‘beaded ligature mark’ around her neck. He said the cause of death was 
‘asphyxia due to ligature suspension’.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox recorded a verdict of accidental death.

She said: ‘This was clearly an absolutely tragic and appalling death and I can’t imagine how the family must feel.’

The Hoeghs, who have two other children, said in a statement that they were ‘devastated’ by their daughter’s death.
