Yale Howarth, 15, was found dead hours after he was questioned by teachers about a sexual encounter with a teenage girl

A 15-year-old schoolboy hanged himself after teachers questioned him over a sexual encounter with a girl and he feared he may be sent to prison, an inquest has heard.

Yale Howarth was found in the garage at his home in Chirk, Wrexham, in January last year. He was taken to hospital but died the following day.

An inquest into the teenager's death heard how Yale was quizzed by teachers at Ysgol Dinas Bran in Llangollen, Denbighshire, after a girl asked a member of school staff for the morning after pill.

During the interview Yale, who was regarded as an intelligent, gifted and polite pupil, said that he and the girl had drunk alcohol at a party and that some sexual foreplay had occurred with the girl’s consent, but they had not had sex.

After the interview, assistant head Dafydd Morris, who was also head of child protection, allegedly told school nurse Sian Hughes they should 'let him sweat on it', the inquest heard, although the teacher  denied making this comment.

The hearing at Ruthin Coroner's Court was told Yale had expressed fears that he could be sent to prison over the incident.

John Gittins, senior coroner for North Wales East and Central recorded a narrative conclusion on Yale's death, and said he may not have intended to kill himself. 

The inquest heard that the girl in question had been drinking, and did not know if she had had sex.

The matter was referred to Wrexham social services, and social worker Paula Moran said she advised Ms Hughes that Yale be interviewed - unaware the girl had accepted his version of events and they had not had sex.

Miss Moran, who broke down in tears as she gave evidence at the inquest, said the girl had made no complaint and it was clear that Yale was not a perpetrator.

The inquest was told   it was unlikely that any further action would have been taken, a view confirmed the following day by Miss Moran's team manager.

'What happened was clearly two teenagers drunk and doing what teenagers do in a consensual way,' she said.

Miss Moran denied advising Mr Morris that Yale’s parents should not be contacted.

Members of staff who spoke to fellow-pupils in the days following Yale’s death said he had expressed concern that he could be sent to prison.

Teaching assistant Phillipa Mathews told the hearing that one girl claimed Yale had received the prison warning from 'teachers', so she reported it to the school's then head, Alison Duffy.

Andrew Wallis, Yale’s head of year, said the teenager would probably have been aware of an earlier unrelated but recent sex case involving a girl, which had resulted in the offenders being sent to prison.

Assitant learning manager Sally Martin, said that immediately after Yale had been questioned Sian Hughes told her: 'Daf [Mr Morris] said let him sweat on it.'

Mr Morris denied having made the comment, adding: 'I would never have said anything like that.'

After Yale's death, his father Mark Howarth lodged a formal complaint, saying that he and Yale's mother Della were not told of the incident, and if they had been they would have been able to support their son.  

The coroner read statements from officials of Wrexham and Denbighshire councils detailing the changes in procedures introduced following an investigation into the tragedy.

In his conclusion, Mr Gittins outlined the events leading up to Yale’s death on January 23, and said the boy was probably embarrassed by the matter and shocked and scared by the possible consequences.

Yale's family have called for schools across the UK to review their procedures as sensitive pupil issues are dealt with

Although Yale did not appear to be distressed when he got home he went to the garage and hanged himself.

'Although there is insufficient evidence to be certain of his intention to end his life at that time the effect of his actions resulted in his death,' he said.

Mr Gittins paid a glowing tribute to the teenager who, he said, would be missed by his family, friends, fellow pupils and staff.

The coroner invited the legal representatives of the family, Denbighshire and Wrexham local authorities and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to submit their views on a possible Regulation 28 letter aimed at preventing future deaths.

In particular, he said, he would like to know what steps had been taken at the school to provide more support for pupils placed in the same situation as Yale.

Yale's family today called for schools across the UK to review their procedures as sensitive pupil issues are dealt with.

They have asked specialist law firm Irwin Mitchell to investigate the events leading up to his death and together lawyers and Yale's parents have urged schools across the country to take note of the tragic incident.

Mr Howarth said: 'We are absolutely devastated by Yale's death and think about him every day.

'It breaks our heart to think that one simple phone call from the school could have potentially saved his life by making us aware of what he was going through.

'I hope that all schools take note of what happened in this situation and ensure that they give their pupils better protection and support than we believe was afforded to Yale.

'The way our son was treated seems so heavy handed. We should have been made aware of the situation so that we had some warning of Yale's state of mind on that day - at the very least we would have been able to check up on him.'

Katie Carroll, an expert lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the family said: 'The family are grateful to the coroner for examining the evidence and we are investigating the events further to help determine if more could have been done to prevent this tragedy. It is crucial that lessons are learned from this to ensure that school children, who are clearly vulnerable and impressionable, are properly supported so as to eliminate the risk of similar incidents in the future.'
