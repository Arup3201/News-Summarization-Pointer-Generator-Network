Desperate times require desperate measures – and when an impala was targeted by two vicious cheetahs, it made a jump for it that will not soon be forgotten.

The distressed animal was captured on camera leaping into a car full of tourists in order to escape the predators.

The terrified animal appeared to be seconds away from death when an unexpected window of opportunity appeared – quite literally.

Close call: The impala jumps into a car to escape two cheetahs in Kruger National Park in South Africa

The animal had been chased by the cheetah along with its herd when it realised it was the only one left behind.

As the two ferocious animals appeared 
to have cornered the impala – it leaped into a nearby car which happened
 to have its windows rolled down.

Samantha Pittendrigh, 20, happened to 
be filming the chase when the impala jumped through the passenger-side 
window of a Toyota  in front of her.

She said: ‘We started freaking out going crazy. We couldn't believe it - we were absolutely dumbstruck.

‘We had absolutely no idea what was going on.

‘We watched the cheetah chasing the 
impala. We saw a few of them turn around in the bushes towards the road 
they were running from.'

‘All of a sudden we saw the impala 
jump out of the bushes and then someone started screaming 'it is in the 
car, it is in the car'.

‘We heard a little girl screaming in 
the car. The boy sitting outside the car filming looked a lot younger, 
so it must have been a family.

‘People in other cars screamed 'open the door, open the door'.’

In the confusion, one of the 
passengers managed to open a door and the impala is seen just seconds 
later trotting across the road to freedom.

The cheetahs are just yards away but do not give chase.

The footage was captured in Kruger 
National Park, South Africa, where according to park rules you must stay
 inside your vehicle at all times.

Miss Pittendrigh, who is studying 
supply chain management at the University of Pretoria, was with her 
friends Tanith Human, 20, Carmen Thvle, 21, and Michelle De Jager, 21.

Unlike some of her friends, she has made several trips to Kruger National Park but was left stunned by the trip.

She added: ‘My family are so jealous. 
In all the years my parents have been going to Kruger Park they have 
never seen anything like it and we do go regularly.

‘It really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing and we managed to be in the right place at the right time.

‘I was very happy to witness something like that but I felt a sorry for the cheetah.

‘There are so many impala, it is not like they will miss one of them.’

However, the world's fastest 
land-animal was not completely ‘cheetah-ed’, as one of them managed to 
make a kill a mere dozen feet along the road, according to Miss 
Pittendrigh.
