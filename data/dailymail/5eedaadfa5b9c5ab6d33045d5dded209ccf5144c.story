Village clubs have been pushed off a former barracks they used as a meeting place – for the Libyan army.

Bassingbourn Barracks has hosted cadet groups, a golf club and a winter sports club since the last British soldiers left it last year.

But the site is now set to host 2,000 Libyan troops for training before they are deployed back to the post-Gaddafi country.

Quiet: Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire usually only hosts village clubs

It means local families who have come to rely on the facilities for their clubs will now have to find new homes.

Despite the blow the Army has said the decision may well not be permanent and it would review the situation after the first round of training.

The clubs based at the barracks have been barred from using the land for their usual activities since March, although the first Libyan soldiers will arrive at the end of 2013.

Bassingbourn Golf Club has already decided to close as a result of the ban.

Bassingbourn Snowsports Club, which has its own slope in the barracks and has been operating for decades, is in talks about buying its part of the site - but any deal will rely on them securing their own access.

Club secretary Martin Middleton said: 'As we have yet to find out the purchase price and cost of alternate access and whether or not the club’s members think this is affordable, we share the concerns of the other clubs about the future use of the barracks.'

Colonel Alex Macintosh, commanding officer of the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps, said: 'The clubs that use the base were given notice when the project to train the Libyan personnel came upon us.'

Adrian Dent, county councillor for Bassingbourn, said it was not known how long clubs would be barred from the barracks.

He said: 'It is a big blow for the area.'

The last British soldiers trained at the Army Training Regiment barracks passed out last summer.Since then the land has passed into the ownership of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO).
