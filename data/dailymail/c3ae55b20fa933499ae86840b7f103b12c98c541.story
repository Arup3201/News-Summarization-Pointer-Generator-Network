An 18-year-old North Carolina woman who made headlines last year as the 'cute mugshot girl' after her arrest on drug charges has landed behind bars - and in front of a camera - once again. 

Alysa Bathrick enjoyed her 15 minutes of fame in December after she  tweeted about her inaugural arrest and included her mugshot, which then got shared thousands of times. 

'Surrendered myself at 7 a.m., got released at 11:30 a.m. F**k what you heard. And my mugshot's cute,' she tweeted.

Started Twitter craze: After Alysa Bathrick posted her mugshot along with this tweet, the admiration for her criminally good looks followed

Just over two months after her first arrest, the 18-year-old was picked up by police in Raleigh on shoplifting charges, reported WFLA. 

Her new booking photo, taken January 26, bears a strong resemblance to the now-famous mugshot, complete with her dramatic dark eyebrows and long highlighted hair parted on the right.

After Bathrick posted her 'cute' jail photo from November, thousands of users took to Twitter to find out for what she's been arrested and also commented on her criminally good looks.

'Xanax homie' she tweeted when asked what she was arrested for.

Bathrick  mentioned on Twitter that she probably wouldn't have gotten caught if her 'ex -boyfriend hadn't told on her' but she won't have any trouble finding a new beau.

Enamored men made sure to tell her they'd be willing to take her ex-boyfriend's place.

'@_ahleesah you got arrested for stealing my heart. Cutest mugshot ever,' tweeted Señor Taco @DannyT4022

'Not gonna lie @_ahleesah is a hottie. Never judge a book by its cover. We all have our stories,' tweeted Abe M. @Broham25.

Law breaker or heart breaker?: Thousands of fans have fluttered to Bathrick's Twitter account after she posted her 'cute mugshot' 

'@_ahleesah you are too fine, lemme arrest you,' said Courson Eells @thecoursoneells.

Bathrick isn't the only person arrested to gain recognition for their good looking mugshots. 

A tan, blue-eyed scorcher named Jeremy Meeks was arrested and charged June 18 with a felony charge of street terrorism, as well as for a misdemeanor charge of resisting/obstruction of justice.

Since being arrested, Meeks was offered a modelling contract and became the subject of internet memes of him modelling Calvin Klein suits.

Meeks also has a felony grand theft conviction from 2002.

Last month, a man named Sean Kory who bares a striking resemblance to Jeremy Meeks was arrested for assaulting a man with a Tennis racket on Halloween.

He was reportedly arrested over the weekend after yelling 'I hate Fox News' and attacking a person dressed as a Fox News reporter at a Halloween parade, reports RawStory.

Despite hating the news, his mugshot happened to show up in various media outlets along with his other good looking counterparts behaving badly. 

The original: Jeremy Meeks, 30, was arrested in June and after this mugshot went viral he was offered a modelling contract and gained scores of fans
