Manchester City stars returned to the club's Carrington training ground for the first day of pre-season training on Monday.

However, with the World Cup still in full flow, manager Manuel Pellegrini welcomed back only a handful of players.

Striker Alvaro Negredo, who missed out on making the Spain squad and has been linked with a move to Atletico Madrid, was present as City prepare to defend their Premier League crown.

The 28-year-old frontman was joined by youngsters Jack Rodwell and Dedryk Boyata while Frenchman Gael Clichy, who wasn't called up to Didier Deschamps' France World Cup squad, also made a return to training.

Over in South America, Man City midfielder Fernandinho could face club team-mates Sergio Aguero and Pablo Zabaleta should Brazil and Argentina make it through to the World Cup final.

Club captain Vincent Kompany helped Belgium reach the quarter-finals while City's Ivory Coast star Yaya Toure, England's James Milner and Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko were all eliminated at the group stage.

The blue half of Manchester have been 
busy during the early stages of the transfer window, completing the 
signings of Bacary Sagna on a free from Arsenal and Port midfielder 
Fernando for £12million.
