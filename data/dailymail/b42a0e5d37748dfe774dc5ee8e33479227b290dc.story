A known criminal and drug user fired at Denver police last month using a gun he had hidden in his butt cheeks.

Isaac Vigil, 32, was already in handcuffs and despite having been frisked three times still managed to pull out the gun and fire at officers outside District 4 Police Station in Denver, Colorado.

The incident occurred on May 14 after local narcotics detectives spotted Vigil smoking meth in a McDonald's parking lot.

Detectives attempted to frisk Vigil, but had difficulty and described him as acting in a ‘highly agitated’ and 'squirrelly' fashion.

During that first attempt to frisk him, a knife allegedly fell from Vigil's wasteband. The detectives also found a crack pipe.

According to the DA's report, Denver Police officers searched Vigil another two times before putting him in the back of the patrol car.

A uniformed officer in a patrol car was 
called for to assist during the arrest because Vigil was ‘violent and 
aggressive behavior,' reports KUSA.

The recovered Raven P25 Auto .25 handgun allegedly fired by Vigil at police had the serial number filed off

The officers needed a car that had a cage in the back to transport Vigil.

Vigil was arrested for possession of drug 
paraphernalia and an outstanding warrant for assault, felony menacing 
and possession of a weapon,

After his arrest, police said he threatened several times to shoot them and that he wanted to die. He also allegedly told police he had been smoking meth for three days and didn't want to go back to prison.

Officers say when they arrived at the police district, Vigil refused to get out of the car and fired two shots from behind his back.

Vigil’s gun then jammed and police shot at him, injuring him in the stomach.

Vigil has an extensive criminal history and wasn't supposed to own a gun after he had been charged with illegal possession in April

Police recovered a Raven P25 Auto .25 handgun from Vigil that had the serial number filed off.

According to the police report, he also had two baggies of meth hidden in his 'rectal area.'

The Denver District Attorney has 
investigated the shooting and on Monday declared that the officer who 
shot Vigil would not have criminal charges brought against him. 

After recovering from his injuries, Vigil is now in Denver Jail. He is facing attempted murder charges for firing at officers.

Vigil has an extensive criminal history and has been arrested many times before. As a convicted felon, he wasn't supposed to own a gun after being charged with illegal possession in April.
