Giuliana Rancic is continuing to remain positive ahead of her double mastectomy this month.

The brave 36-year-old E! News host spoke candidly about the upcoming procedure on The Wendy Williams show today.

During the interview, she described scars 'as beautiful' and said that she will feel more womanly once her surgery is completed.

'Listen, I love my girls [but] I'm gonna feel more like a woman when this is all done,' she told Wendy. 'I think scars are beautiful. I think scars tell a story.'

Her supportive husband Bill, who appeared alongside his wife, said that they will be: 'A badge of courage.'

Giuliana will also undergo a reconstruction directly after her double mastectomy, which is scheduled for this month.

The upbeat TV presenter told Williams that it was important that the couple remain lighthearted about the ordeal.

'They might come out looking even hotter,' she laughed. 'You gotta have fun with this. We find the humor in everything. Bill helped pick 'em out. I'm like, Bill, that big? Really?'

Bill said they were confident doctors will have success with the surgery.

'They've come a long way,' he said. 'We've seen a lot of before and after and it's remarkable.'

Just
hours after revealing that she would undergo the procedures, Giuliana 
launched herself right back into work, interviewing Angelina Jolie at the In The Land Of Blood And Honey premiere for E! last night. 

She will also head back to hosting duties alongside Ryan Seacrest on Monday.

'I'll be on E! News Monday and then I'll be out of your hair for two weeks,' she told Seacrest today on his KIIS FM 102.7 show.

Having a laugh: The trio had a few laughs during the interview

Giuliana revealed that she will be undergoing a double mastectomy, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in October on The Today show, yesterday.

The E! News presenter spoke openly about her decision during the interview.

America's popular morning show updated its Twitter feed yesterday, saying: '"I'm going to go ahead and move forward with a double mastectomy." -@GiulianaRancic'.

In October, Giuliana initially underwent a double lumpectomy to removed cancerous growths in both breasts as well as her lymph nodes - but now she is taking extra measures after doctors failed to 'get all the cancer out'

Bill, who sat by his wife's side throughout the interview, explained that medics were unable to 'clear all the margins' and get all the cancer out, hence the final decision of double mastectomy.

He
said: 'We were left with the decision, do you go back and do another 
lumpectomy and try to clean it out or go forward with a more radical 
procedure?'

Giuliana even joked that the pair made a 'pros and cons list' to help them cement their decision.

She
said her decision to have children played a part in making the 
decision, as otherwise she would have had to undergo another lumpectomy,
radiation and two to five years of anti-oestrogen therapy, which would 
have put her into early menopause.

She said: 'To be honest, all it came down to was choosing to live and not looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. It could have come back more aggressively next time, so for me it was just more important to get the cancer out.

Honest: Giuliana said she came forward about the illness to encourage other women to check themselves

'With the double mastectomy I now have less than one per cent chance of getting it back, otherwise it was 20, 30 or 40 per cent chance and for me it wasn't worth it.

'Bill said to me, "I just need you 
around for the next 50 years, kid. I don't care about the physical 
portion of this, so let's just get you healthy."'

Giuliana,
speaking very calmly on the show, added: 'Bill's been the world to me 
through this, he brought some laughter to the process and reminded me 
who we are as a couple.

Optimistic: E! News presenter said the love from her fans has kept her strong

'It's made us stronger. I couldn't be more at peace with the decision. I still break down some nights when it's quiet in bed, it's easy to just start crying and be very sad, but I'm okay.'

Bill had a positive outlook, saying: 'I'm focused on the finished line, we'll be done with this by Christmas time and then we don't look back..'

During her return to work last month, Rancic said she owed her inner strength to the influx of support from her fans.

Family on hold: The couple will wait until Giuliana has recovered before embarking on IVF again

She told Parade magazine: 'I'm good. I'm hanging in there. I have good days and bad days, but so far good.

'I'm
very optimistic and I'm just happy to have caught it early. I think 
that's really the most important thing. Early detection means so much.'

Rancic discovered her tumour in its early stages during a doctor-recommended mammogram while undergoing in vitro fertilisation.

Having
married entrepreneur Bill, who shot to fame on The Apprentice USA, in 
September 2007, the pair have made several attempts to have a child.

However, they experienced problems with conceiving and doctors recommended that Giuliana gain weight to increase their chances.

By 2010 she had put on five pounds, before embarking on IVF that March.

Sadly, despite falling pregnant in the spring, Giuliana suffered a miscarriage at eight weeks.

The couple have now decided to put a family on hold until Giuliana has made a full recovery.
