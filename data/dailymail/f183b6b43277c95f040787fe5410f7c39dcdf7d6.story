An 18-year-old man woke up in hospital two days after he took a SnapChat pill with little memory of his terrifying brush with the drug.

The Palmerston teenager was hanging out with his mates when he took the $35 drug on Friday at 8.30pm, and two hours later he was fighting for his life in the back of ambulance.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, said all he remembered was asking someone to call an ambulance before collapsing on a driveway next door.

A 18-year-old man, who spent two days in intensive care after taking a SnapChat pill (pictured), said he could hardly remember what happened

'That's all I sort of remembered other than waking up in hospital and in the ambulance,' he told Nine News Darwin.

The 18-year-old, who works for a local company, warned others of the effects of the drug.

'From my point of view, I definitely say don't take it,' he said.

'There's a choice. Go find yourself something else if you want to have a good time.

'Stay clear of the SnapChats for sure.'

The Palmerston teenager wanted to remain anonymous but spoke out about his Friday night experience with the drug

The man was in intensive care for two days at Royal Darwin Hospital.

He was just one of four people who were hospitalised in Darwin alone on Friday.

The drug is named after the photo-messaging phone app, SnapChat, has similar properties to a notorious drug that contains bath salts.

It is sold in a pink or blue form with green speckles and the app's logo imprinted on it.

Police are expressing grave concern about the drug, which is causing people to behave in an erratic and irrational manner and causing aggressive and disoriented behaviour.
