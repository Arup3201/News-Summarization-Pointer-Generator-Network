Tony Pulis called for the introduction of video technology after Gareth McAuley was sent off in a case of mistaken identity after 90 seconds of West Brom's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City.

The Baggies defender was dismissed by Neil Swarbrick instead of teammate Michael Dawson who sent Wilfried Bony crashing to the floor when he was clean through.

After the match an incredulous Pulis said: 'I can't believe he's picked the wrong player - it's beyond me.'

He added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced.

'It is no good moaning about referees,' Pulis said.

'We have to find a way to help referees out I would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video.

'The clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better.' 

BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him 

A difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are, for now, three points behind leaders Chelsea who have two games in hand. 

City manager Manuel Pellegrini reflected on a morale-boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at Burnley and then bow out of the Champions League at Barcelona.

'Of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game,' he said.

'We lost the last two games in different competitions, Wednesday in Champions League and the last game against Burnley in Premier League. It is important to return to victory.' 

Fernando (centre) scored City's second of the match after Bony's opener and before David Silva added a third

The Chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on Jose Mourinho's leaders.

'We are not thinking about that,' he said.

'I spoke with the players, we play now eight games more. We can win the eight games and if Chelsea doesn't drop points, we cannot win the title. The important thing is not to think about other teams, it is to think about our team, to improve and win the next game against Crystal Palace.'
