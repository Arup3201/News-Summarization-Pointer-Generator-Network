Legendary commentator John Hunt, 57, has seen it all from what he calls his 'view in the clouds' and on Thursday he set his sights on the critics of horse-racing, labelling them 'unrealistic and completely uneducated', after the tragic events of Melbourne Cup Day.

'These are just things that happen, that's just life, I mean people have heart attacks and so do horses,' he said in reference to the sad demise of Admire Rakti and Araldo after the big race.

'You can always shut the gate after the horse has bolted but it's pretty hard to predict every single thing that could happen in the world but to compare waving a flag in the crowd and a horse having a heart attack with being cruel to horses is unreasonable, unrealistic and completely uneducated.'

That's it for me. John Hunt calls time on a 30 year race-calling career

His tales from the track are as many as they are varied. 

He remembers watching on from his vantage point high up in the stands as 'a scallywag bookmaker' ran for his life from a phalanx of irate punters demanding their cash, to a trainer who conspired to fix a race with his two horses, only for the wrong one to win costing him thousands of dollars. 

'I've also seen a bloke jump off a horse to make sure it gets beaten but then racing is no different to other forms,' he said. 

'There is that side to the industry but there is that (seedy) side to many industries, I always say to people that racing is no different to real estate or the law profession or anything else for that matter.

'It has some good people in it and it has some scallywags in it, that's just life.

'I don't think racing necessarily has more than plenty of other industries but, yes, it does have some notable ones because where money is involved and there's gambling, you are sure to attract that kind of element.

'Rather than dwell on the negative side of the sport, most of what I have seen is just simply uplifting, I have seen things that would make grown men cry. That's the beauty and the romance of racing.'

A champion junior tennis player, John Hunt celebrates with Australian legend Evonne Cawley (Goolagong). His career in the spot and hopes of winning at Wimbledon one day was cut short by a serious back injury

However, he might have been the watched rather than the watcher, if fate hadn't intervened and cut short a promising tennis career.

He'd been the top junior in WA and even had the privilege of sharing a celebratory drink with Wimbledon champion and Australian legend Evonne Cawley (Goolagong) but at age 19 he was carried off the tennis court in agony as his back gave out. So the avid fan of racing and race commentators, decided that he would train himself as a caller.

Armed with tape recorder he practised and then went out and cut his teeth in the bush, including places like Marble Bar and Port Hedland and he said that 'some of the places I started at are ghost towns now but when you're 19 just starting out, you'll go anywhere to get experience'.

Employed within six months, he went on to become a leading broadcaster of thoroughbred racing, harness racing and greyhounds. A stellar career which would stretch some three decades, all because of his love of the animals.

'It can make you cry because horses strive to be a winner and they do with no ulterior motive because they choose to,' he said.

'It's a wonderful thing, it's an innocence - there's no guile attached to what they want to do, if they want to try to win from an unlikely position, if they look beaten and somehow find a way to win then it's because they want to.

'That's what brings a tear to the corner of you eye , the bravery like that born of innocence, it's an amazing thing and that's the type of thing that crosses demographics.'

The Gloucester Park faithful make their feelings known as John Hunt calls it quits on his broadcasting career

They say never work with children and animals. John Hunt breaks at least one of those rules as he undertakes a television interview with a furry friend as company

One of his favourite of all time was champion pacer Village Kid 'he came out at the age of 13 to do a time trial in aid of the Make A Wish Foundation, to make money for the kids and ran the fastest time of his entire career after almost 200 race starts on the final night he set foot on a racetrack, breaking all sorts of world records, the tears were just flowing'.

On December 12, 2008, his last night in the broadcast box, there wasn't a dry eye in the house either, as his good mate and superstar driver Chris Lewis took his horse to the line first, saluting his mate high up in the Gloucester Park stands as he won.
