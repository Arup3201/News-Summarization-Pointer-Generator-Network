Real Madrid galactico Cristiano Ronaldo, the sports darling of social media, will sometime on Tuesday become the first athlete to have 100 million Facebook followers.

This puts him nearly 30m fans in front of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, his rival for world No 1 footballer.

The commercial power of Ronaldo, who also has 30.5m Twitter followers, was demonstrated when he posted six messages over two days advertising the Tag Heuer watch brand.

These received 34.9m Facebook hits and 2.4m likes, valued at more than £300,000 by the watch company.

Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney earlier this month became the first Premier League footballer to reach 10m followers on Twitter.

The England captain, who thanked his fans after reaching the landmark, is the fifth most-followed footballer, and the sixth most-followed athlete globally.

Predictably, Ronaldo tops the list of most-followed athletes on Twitter, too.
