The daughter of legendary radio show host Casey Kasem, who has been missing from his California care home since May 7, is filing a missing persons report today.

Kerri Kasem alleges that her father's wife, Jean, moved the former Top 40 host to a Native American reservation in Washington.

By filing an official missing person's report, the FBI and police will be able to join the search for Kasem, who is 82, has advanced Parkinson's, and struggles to speak.

Worried: Kerri Kasem has been made a temporary caretaker for her father and a judge demanded an investigation into his disappearance

A judge has made Miss Kasem a temporary caretaker for her father, and the courts have ordered an investigation into his whereabouts as his adult children say they fear for his well being.

'We don't know where he is. Nobody knows,' Danny Deraney, a representative for Miss Kasem, told People.

The radio show host's middle daughter said that she and her sister Julie had visited their father last week, just days before he was secretly moved from his Santa Monica nursing home.

Miss Kasem claims that her estranged stepmom, Jean Kasem is 
responsible for the disappearance, and that the woman moved him in the 
middle of the night without a court order or doctor's discharge.

On Tuesday, a court granted Miss Kasem conservatorship of her father's health.

'I will do whatever I need to do to get my dad back!' Kerri, 35, told Closer.
 'I'm praying that he is somewhere safe. I'm praying to God that he’s 
being cared for and that he's not getting sicker and sicker by the day.'

When
 she visited her dad on May 6 it was the first time she had been able to
 see him in five months. An attorney had to help her and her sister gain
 access to his room.

'They let me and my sister in to see him and it was a wonderful visit,' Miss Kasem said. 'My dad said, "I love you".

'Dad was animated. He was smiling. He moved his arms a little bit. He knew we were there,' she added to Closer.

'When
 we went to leave, we said, "Dad, we'll be back soon. We'll be back 
soon." That's when he looked up at us and was able to say the word, 
"When?" We said, "Dad, as soon as we can,"' she said.

Attorney Martha Patterson, an attorney for Ms Kasem, has claimed that Jean Kasem has no authority  to act as a healthcare agent or to move her husband without permission from a doctor.

'I cannot imagine someone in his condition being carried out without proper medical equipment,' she said.

Miss Kasem added that she was 'filled with an extreme amount of worry' about her father.

The daughter's words come after a 
judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of the comedian 
after an attorney for the ailing man's wife said he had been removed 
from the country.

Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator 
and adult protective services to find out where Mr Kasem is being 
treated and report back to the court.

The elderly radio personality has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife.

His
 children had earlier complained they had been unable to see their 
father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother.

Miss Kasem's attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to a Native American reservation in Washington state.

Judge Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country.

'I have no idea where he is,'Mr Marcus said.

The
 revelation brought stunned protests from Judge Murphy and two of Mr Kasem's daughters from a 
previous marriage.

'Your statements concern me even more,' the judge told Mr Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing.

Mr Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit.

Judge
 Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Mr Kasem's care and ordered a 
court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as 
possible.

Mr Kasem 
gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and 
Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.

As
 temporary conservator, Miss Kasem will have access to her father's 
medical records and other reports that have previously been sealed by 
court order.

Miss Kasem's case is the second one opened by one of the former host's children to try to gain access to their father and have some oversight over his care.

A previous case by her sister, Julie, was dismissed after she reached a settlement with her stepmother, but the daughter said on Monday that agreement has been breached.

In a court filing last week, Kerri Kasem's attorneys wrote that the entertainer has been repeatedly moved without warning and his children have been unable to see him. The complaint accused Jean Kasem of elder abuse by isolating her husband from his family.

'We've been troubled for a long time,' Miss Kasem said after Monday's court hearing. She said Judge Murphy's orders will ensure that the truth about her father's care comes out.

'Justice has been served today,' she said.
