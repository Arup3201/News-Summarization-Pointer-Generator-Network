Four years after a trainer was drowned and dismembered by a killer whale at SeaWorld, employees are being made to wear safety vests. But critics believe the jackets still wouldn't save lives in a confrontation with one of the ocean predators.

SeaWorld trainers started wearing the new inflatable safety vests on Monday, which marine park officials say took three years to develop.

The slim jackets are inflatable and even include a small oxygen tank which can buy a trainer a few minutes of breathing if dragged underwater.

The jackets are just one of many new safety measures instituted by the park after the February 24, 2020 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau.

life saver: Starting Monday, SeaWorld is requiring orca trainers to wear new custom-designed safety vests while interacting with whales at their shows

Response: The new safety vests become inflatable and also have a small oxygen tank allowing for a few minutes of breathing underwater

Brancheau was performing with a killer
 whale named Tilikum at the Shamu Stadium in Orlando when the orca 
pulled her off the platform and into the pool - refusing to release her.

Since
 Brancheau's death, trainers have been unable to get into the water with
 the killer whales amid calls for new safety measures.

Kelly
 Flaherty Clark, SeaWorld's curator of animal training, refused to 
speculate on whether the new vests would have saved Brancheau's life, 
but David Kirby, author of 'Death at SeaWorld', offered up his negative 
opinion.

He told WKMG that the vest 'would not have saved any of the trainers who 
were killed by orcas. Dawn was rammed and dismember by Tilikum, A vest 
and spare air would have been useless.'

He
 also points out that the vests are dangerous as well, and could give 
trainers the bends if they were using the oxygen tank and suddenly 
pushed to the surface by one of the whales.Â 

Tragedy: The new safety measures come four years after the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was dismembered after being dragged underwater by a killer whale named Tilikum

Other safety changes include remotely controlled pool gates, new walkways around Shamu Stadium and an additional raised platform in an orca pool that could be used to lift a whale out of the water should a trainer fall in. But the vests are probably the most visible change that park visitors will notice, she said.

The start of using the vests had nothing to do with an appellate court's recent decision upholding a ruling that Sea World had violated a federal workplace safety law, Flaherty Clark added.

Earlier this month, that appellate court in Washington upheld a regulatory safety finding against Sea World by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission following an investigation into Brancheau's drowning.

The court said Sea World had exposed trainers to recognized hazards when working in close contact with killer whales during performances.

Currently, trainers are not allowed in the water with the orcas, and must remain 18 inches away from the whales while standing and three feet while kneeling.

Faherty-Clark says the new jackets aren't a part of a ploy to get trainers back into the pool for shows.

'Right now, that's not something we're even considering. This is just a piece of equipment to maybe make that environment a little bit safer,' Faherty-Clark told WESH.

The dark side of SeaWorld: After Brancheau's death, Tilikum became the subject of an HBO documentary about deaths at the park. The film argues that killer whales in captivity become more aggressive to humans and each other

Known danger: The whale Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths when trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged underwater by him during a show

Tilikum subsequently became the focus of the 2013 documentary film 'Blackfish,' which explores what may have caused Tilikum to kill Brancheau.

The documentary argues that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other.  Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. parks.

'The two things happened in completely different silos,' Flaherty Clark said of the ruling and the use of the vests. 'The team was close to complete before the ruling.'
