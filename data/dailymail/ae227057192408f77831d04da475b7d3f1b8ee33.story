Jose Mourinho has dropped his biggest hint yet that Chelsea will make a summer move to sign Monaco striker Radamel Falcao.

The Chelsea manager has made no secret of his desire to bring in a striker in the close season and Colombia star Falcao - currently sidelined with a knee ligament injury - is reportedly considering quitting France after just one year due to the lack of competition in Ligue 1.

In an interview in French on Canal Football Club, Mourinho also ruled out a move for Paris Saint-Germain's strike duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani.

He said: 'I have a team, but no striker. Falcao does not have a team. A player like him can't play in front of 3,000 people. Monaco is a club to end [your career with].'

Falcao, 28, joined Monaco for £50million from Atletico Madrid last summer.

At around the same time, Uruguay striker Cavani moved to PSG for £54m. He too is unhappy in France and specifically at having to play second fiddle to Ibrahimovic.

But Mourinho moved to quash rumours that Chelsea star Eden Hazard could be used as bait to lure Cavani in a swap deal.

'Eden is our boy,' he added. 'We want him
 to stay for 10 years. We want to build the team around him. He’s a 
player with the style of football that we want to have in our team.'

Monaco's average attendance of just 9,112 is the second-lowest in France's top flight. 

On Ibrahimovic, Mourinho added: 'Zlatan to Chelsea? It’s impossible.

'He’s happy at Paris. I know because he is my friend and we are in touch.

'PSG, with all its wealth, would never open the door. That’s mission impossible.'

Falcao has taken a big step towards featuring in this summer's World Cup after he posted a picture on Instagram showing himself without crutches.

The striker was thought to be out of the World Cup but his manager at Monaco, Claudio Ranieri, believes he will be fit in time to feature for Colombia.

'He’s doing well and working hard. His knee is reacting very positively,' said Raniei. 'I think he’ll play at the World Cup.'
