These are the first photographs taken inside the mysterious Tibetan city of Lhasa during a British expedition over a hundred years ago.

British Army soldiers are believed to be some of the first westerners to enter the capital city - often known as the Forbidden City due to its remoteness and the clergy's hostility towards those from abroad.

As a result, these images taken during the 1904 expedition showed the beautiful landscape and surroundings of Lhasa to the west for the first time.

First: This image shows the Tibetan Forbidden City of Lhasa, photographed from afar by British troops in 1904

Arrival: The troops, the first westerners to enter Tibet's capital, photographed the moment they arrived, above

Cultural: Images showing groups of Tibetan Buddhists, or Lamas, seen above, were taken by the troops

Insight: More Lamas gather in the streets of Lhasa alongside their mules

Glimpse: A row of troops stand with a convoy of mules just behind them

The expedition was led
 by Colonel Francis Younghusband but initiated by the Viceroy of India Lord Curzon who was obsessed with stopping Russia from gaining control in the country.

The fascinating sepia pictures show the journey British troops would have taken and detail several buildings including monasteries and forts.

Tibetan Lamas - Buddhists who teach the Dharma - and a convoy of mules can also be seen in the remarkable archive.

Some of the pictures also show a unique insight into the life of a British soldier - as troops can be seen building rafts to cross a river and fishing.

Unique: Other images were taken of the landscape and people of Tibet during the exhibition. This photograph shows forces marching out of a monastery in the town of Phari

In action: Tibetans walk a mule across a large expanse of water - captioned as the Tsampo on the image

Afloat: Lamas and locals make small boats, created from animal skins, and set sail across the water

Recreation: A British troop does a spot of fishing while on the expedition

Architecture: This image shows Phari Dzong - an impressive military fort close to the city of Lhasa

Views: A convoy of mules stand at the base of snowy mountains near to the Phari fort

The amazing collection will now be sold at auction and is expected to sell for around £15,000.

As well as the images, there are also a number of precious artifacts that will be sold.

The relics include a set of monastery keys that were dropped by a monk upon seeing the British arrive into the city.

There is also a 17ins long ceremonial dagger and a Tibetan ritual Gyaling trumpet.

Until now, the items have been held 
in the family of two British servicemen from the time; Colonel C.C 
Marindin and Sub Contractor Arthur Brand of the Kings Royal Rifles.

The controversial British expedition into Tibet began in December 1903, 
when 3,000 troops marched into the country from British-ruled India.

Building: A selection of animals can be seen grazing in front of another fort, captioned Peterjong on the original

It was initiated by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, who was obsessed with preventing Russia gaining influence in Tibet and the rest of Asia.

In April 1903, Russia had told the British 
Government it had no intentions of invading India, but Curzon 
insisted the troops should still go to Tibet.

Lord Curson intended to make Tibetan officials sign a 
convention to promise Russia would not be allowed to interfere in its 
affairs.

For sale: The archive will be sold at auction his Saturday along with these iron keys to a Lhasa monastery

Rare: This Tibetan ritual Gyaling trumpet will also feature in the collection

Auction: A Tibetan silver & copper dagger will also be sold. The collection is predicted to fetch up to £15,000

At the time, Tibet was the only Himalayan kingdom not be under colonial British rule.

The
 men, led
 by Colonel Francis Younghusband, reached Lhasa in August 1904.

Up to 3,000 Tibetans were killed by the advancing British troops, with Britain losing 202 men.

Sources suggest 411 Britons died of other causes such as disease.

Eventually, the Tibetan government signed a treaty 
effectively turning the country into a British protectorate.

The collection will be sold by 
auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes, Wiltshrie, on Saturday.

Lord Curzon, right, the head of the ruling 
British government in India, feared Russia had its sights set on the 
country following its advances into Central Asia.

By
 April 1903, Russia told the British Government that it had no 
intentions of invading India, but Curzon insisted troops should go to 
Tibet to make its officials sign a convention to promise Russia would 
not be allowed to interfere in its affairs.

Tibet was the only Himalayan kingdom at the time to not be under colonial British rule.

The expedition, led by Colonel Younghusband, began in December 1903 and lasted until the following September.

Between 2,000 and 3,000 Tibetans are thought to have been killed by the advancing British troops.

Britain lost 202 men from its 3,000-strong force because of fighting, while 411 died of other causes.
