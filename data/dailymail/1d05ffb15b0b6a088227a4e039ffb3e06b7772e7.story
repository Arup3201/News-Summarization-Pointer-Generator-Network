Fine tuning: Anne Hathaway is set to return to singing on screen in film Song One

After her triumph in the movie Les Miserables, Anne Hathaway has got the singing bug.

The actress, front-runner to win the best supporting Oscar for her indescribably sublime Les Mis performance, is having a number specially written for her in a new film that she will shoot later in the year called Song One.

In the movie, she will play an archaeologist who falls for a rock star — to be played by British singer-actor Johnny Flynn.

They meet when Hathaway’s character returns to the US from a dig in Morocco, when her brother is injured.

Flynn plays the brother’s favourite musician and, well, I won’t give the whole plot away but you can see where it’s going.

In real life, Flynn fronts folk band Johnny Flynn And The Sussex Wit. Johnathan Rice and Jenny Lewis are writing songs for Flynn to perform, but one track will be reserved for Hathaway.

The film’s been written by Kate Barker-Froyland, who will also direct. It will shoot on locations in the US in the autumn and Hathaway’s husband Adam Shulman will be one of the producers.

The actress had been expected to star in Steven Spielberg’s Robopocalypse, which was to have filmed in London next month, but it has been put back till next year at the earliest, for more budget and pre-production work.

Another project on Hathaway’s mind is My Fair Lady.

When I spoke to her Wednesday night, at a cocktail party Vanity Fair magazine hosted for Les Miserables, she told me she’d had exploratory conversations a couple of years ago about doing My Fair Lady on stage — and possibly on screen.

If she did a theatre version it could well be with Dominic West, who was in a splendid production in Sheffield recently, while the film could be with Colin Firth.

‘I haven’t heard for a while what’s happening with My Fair Lady,’ she said, ‘and I don’t know whether I would do it on stage, or screen, but either would be a treat.’

Stage ready: Although she has got her crowd-clap perfected, Anne's new rocker project is for the big screen where she plays an archeologist who falls for a musician

I notice that record producer Clive Davis told a US newspaper that he’d like to offer Hathaway the chance to do My Fair Lady on Broadway.

But he might have to get past Cameron Mackintosh first. Mackintosh would like to do a My Fair Lady revival in the West End in a couple of years and, of course, he has just worked with Hathaway on Les Mis.

Mackintosh has also been planning a movie of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe show for a while, and hired Emma Thompson to write a screenplay.

But there are complex rights issues involving copyright returning to the family of the creators, and other convoluted licensing matters that are being painstakingly resolved. I would need the pages of a book to explain but, essentially, Hathaway won’t be dancing all night just yet.

Theatre wizard: Susan Stroman, director of The Scottsboro Boys

Around this time three years ago, I stopped off in New York on the way home from the Oscars to see a show called The Scottsboro Boys by John Kander and Fred Ebb, directed by that musical theatre wonder woman Susan Stroman.

It was playing downtown at the Vineyard Theatre and I knew a little bit about the nine boys, aged between 12 and 19, who were put on trial in 1931 for the alleged rape of two white women in Alabama — even though one woman recanted her statement and it was obvious the other woman’s testimony was a fabrication.

I caught a preview and was initially outraged that Kander and Ebb had chosen to present the story almost like a minstrel show with black actors playing white characters. But I stuck with it, and all became clear.

The production knocked me for six. I 
couldn’t speak as I sat in my seat, weeping, furious at the injustices 
those nine young boys had endured.

It remains one of the most stunning 
pieces of theatre I have ever seen.

Well,
 The Scottsboro Boys is coming to London. David Lan, the Young Vic’s 
artistic director, has been after it for years and Ms Stroman — the 
force behind The Producers, Crazy For You and others — will direct and 
choreograph. Performances begin at the Young Vic on October 18.

‘It
 seemed proper that we remembered them again,’ Stroman told me on Monday
 in New York. ‘It was a terrible mark on American history.’

She
 made the point that the boys’ names were never widely known and she, 
along with Kander, Ebb and book writer David Thompson, were ‘determined 
to bring them to life, as individuals’. Stroman had worked with Kander 
and Ebb, the creators of shows such as Cabaret and Chicago, before. But 
Ebb died before the project could be finished, and Stroman assumed the 
show would be dropped.

‘But John Kander didn’t want to let it go,’ David Lan, of the Young Vic, said. He was determined to finish it — and see it on stage.

Stroman acknowledged that the minstrel show was a racist art form, popular in the US in the Thirties. But she observed that newsreels of the day said the trial was ‘like watching a minstrel show’.

And the startling format — with only one white actor in the cast — allows the show to make a searing comment on race relations today. I’m sure that some (like me) will find it controversial, initially, but it’s going to be quite something. And the only staging is chairs that are used as a train, a cell and, devastatingly, an electric chair. Casting will be a mixture of US and UK actors.

Julianne Moore and Kirsten Dunst were among those at a private L.A. showcase of Bulgari jewels once owned by Elizabeth Taylor.

We had to troop upstairs at the Bulgari store on North Rodeo Drive to see the stunning diamond and emerald pieces.

There was a diamond ring on display that Elizabeth wore when I sang to her at one of her birthday parties.

Richard Burton bought most of the beautiful baubles, and Bulgari purchased them back  from the actress’s estate when she died.

Burton is quoted as saying: ‘I introduced her to beer, she introduced me to Bulgari.’ He added: ‘The only word Elizabeth knows in Italian is Bulgari.’

Helena Bonham Carter should pay a visit while she’s in LA. The star is portraying Elizabeth in a BBC drama called Burton And Taylor. She won’t be impersonating Taylor — rather she’ll be attempting to capture the essence of her. Dominic West will play Burton.

Charles Finch’s pre-Bafta bash with 
Chanel was such a hit that his Oscar dinner tomorrow night at
 Madeo in Los Angeles is over-subscribed, with everyone who’s anyone 
(and some who aren’t) clamouring for an invitation.

So far Finch and the folk at Chanel 
have put the following on the list: Harvey Weinsten, Bradley Cooper, 
Andrea Riseborough, January Jones, Adrien Brody, Tom Hooper, Felicity 
Jones (who may be in Oscar contention next year thanks to Ralph Fiennes’
 film The Invisible Woman), Kate Bosworth, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley 
(who I believe is a model and perhaps has given up acting), Danny 
Huston, Alicia Vikander, Rose Byrne, Lily Collins, Alice Eve, Ginnifer 
Goodwin, Chloe Moretz, Emily Mortimer and Bonnie Wright . Oh yes, and 
Ioan Gruffudd, along with Sophie and Freddie Windsor.

There are many more going, but I don’t have space to mention them.

Finch, very wickedly, sent me a couple of last-minute excuses doing the rounds.

‘I am only going if Gerard Butler is going. And I want to sit next to him.’ Followed by...‘Promise me Gerry Butler isn’t going.’

How cruel. Mr Butler isn’t on the list. He’s such a good guy.
