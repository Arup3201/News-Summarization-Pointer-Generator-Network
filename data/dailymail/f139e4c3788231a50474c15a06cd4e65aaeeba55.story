Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes has revealed his friendship with Eddie McGuire is over following the racial comments he made about the player last year.

The dual Brownlow Medalist today broke his silence over McGuire's on-air gaffe when he suggested Goodes, 34, be part of the promotion of King Kong the musical.

It happened just days after one of the games most loyal servants was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old girl during a match against Collingwood - the club McGuire is president of.

Today Adam Goodes revealed he no longer considers McGuire a friend while speaking at a corporate business breakfast in Sydney.

'I would have liked to have called Eddie a friend before that incident,’ he said at a Corporate Club Australia breakfast in Sydney this morning.

At the time of the incident McGuire, 49, went public with an apology and said he would remain as Collingwood' President despite pressure for him to resign.

He said: 'It burns me to the core that I would be associated with vilifying.'

'Every part of my being is about equality.'

AFL boss Andrew Demetriou said McGuire's comments would be investigated, but his position at Collingwood remained in tact.

At the time Goodes singled the young fan out in the crowd, McGuire stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game.

He reacted by stepping in to support Goodes and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went.

But all his good work was undone when the Triple M radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting Adam Goodes be flown down from Sydney to Melbourne to help promote King Kong the musical.

According to Fairfax Media reports today, Goodes said he would still be prepared to shake McGuire's hand, but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship.

'To have a friend and someone there that night who shook my hand in the dressing room afterwards, to have him say what he did was disappointing and uncomfortable but that’s how friendships end.'

Goodes also said he did not regret singling out the young girl who had vilified him.

'It was just a natural part of what I would do on a footy field,' he said.

'It was part of me acting instinctively.'

At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year.

He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year.

On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia.

He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL.

'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.'
