Despite endless rounds of studies and tests, it seems no one has quite figured out if red wine is good or bad for our health.

But one cardiologist made up his mind a long time ago – and has been doling out glasses of red to his patients for the past ten years.

Dr William McCrea is convinced that the drink helps prevent heart attacks and strokes and is often found wheeling a trolley of wine on his rounds.

Cardiologist Dr William McCrea prescribes red wine to his patients to prevent heart attacks and strokes

Dr McCrea says drinking two small glasses a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack by half

According to Dr McCrea, pictured, the antioxidants found in the seeds and skins used to make red wine can dramatically improve your health.

And the most beneficial wines won’t break the bank – as they can all be found on your supermarket shelves.

He recommends drinking cheap, new varieties made from grapes grown at higher altitudes.These are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, giving them a greater concentration of antioxidants.

Among the cardiologist’s preferred varieties are a Pinot Noir or a Shiraz from South Africa, an Argentinian Malbec or his particular favourite, a Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile.

The consultant prescribes the drink to
 patients in the cardiology ward like he would any other medicine, with 
precise measures to be taken at regular intervals. He says their good 
results support the theory that drinking a small amount every day can be
 beneficial.

Dr McCrea began
 to hand out wine after discovering that the French suffer from far 
fewer heart attacks, despite their fatty diets and higher smoking rates.

He believes the 
antioxidant properties of red wine reduce the risk of second heart 
attacks by half – and the risk of stroke by 20 per cent.

The
 cardiologist has now recommended two 125ml glasses a day to around 
10,000 patients at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. And
 he insists that young wines in screw-top bottles – which are usually 
the cheapest – are the healthiest varieties.

Fortunately
 his local supermarkets usually stock enough of his recommended tipple, a
 Montes Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon which costs around £7 a bottle.

Dr
 McCrea, 58, explained: ‘The French consume twice the amount of fat we 
do, smoke more, and they don’t do any more exercise than us, but their 
rate of deaths from heart attacks is half of ours. What’s the 
difference? They drink red wine like we drink tea.

‘It’s
 their drinking behaviour that’s important. The British don’t drink 
alcohol regularly, but when we do, we drink to excess. They don’t, as a 
rule.

Dr McCrea, who works at Great Western Hospital, in Swindon (pictured), has given red wine to 10,000 patients over the last 10 years and says the results among his patients are notable

‘Also the wine cheers 
patients up and focuses them on their recovery by relaxing them during a
 very tense period. Hardly any of my patients who have a heart attack 
who go on to have red wine ever come back into the hospital again, which
 is unusual.

‘I’ve given it to 10,000 patients and the chances of a second heart attack have been reduced by around 50 per cent.’

The skins of certain red wine grapes, which are used in the fermenting process, are particularly rich in antioxidants.

One
 antioxidant called resveratrol is particularly good at mopping up 
chemicals responsible for causing blood clots, the primary cause of 
heart disease.

This prevents clots from developing inside the arteries, raising levels of good cholesterol and causing the arteries to dilate.

Dr
 McCrea recommends young red wines with the highest antioxidant 
concentrations, which tend to come from high altitudes. However white 
wine does not have the same benefit as the healthy chemicals found in 
the grape skins are discarded during its manufacture.

Speaking
 from his home in Swindon, he said: ‘Initially people tend to be a bit 
surprised by my approach. But I find that quite apart from the medicinal
 effects, the wine is a good distraction.

‘When
 somebody has a heart attack it’s a shock, people are alarmed and 
anxious so the red wine also helps to relax them and reduce stress.’

It works because red wine dilates the arteries and raises good cholesterol
