The BBC has been accused of ‘losing all proportion’ in its coverage of Nelson Mandela’s death after it emerged more than 100 programmes have been broadcast about him in the past week.

A total of 1,834 viewers and listeners have complained as the airwaves continue to be flooded with tributes disrupting radio and TV schedules.

MPs castigated the corporation for wasting money as it was revealed bosses spent thousands of pounds sending eight staff to Johannesburg for a special edition of Question Time.

They even admitted splashing out on business class flights for one panellist, Labour MP Peter Hain.

Last
 night, Tory MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Commons culture, media and 
sport committee, said the programme added ‘precisely nothing’ to 
viewers’ knowledge of South African affairs, adding: ‘There is no doubt 
that Mandela’s death was an international event.

‘This was a man who was one of the great leaders of the 20th and 21st centuries. He taught us all about peace and recognition.

But the BBC could have told us about these things without going to the huge expense they have.

‘They
 have simply got carried away with the emotional importance of the 
event. Question Time might have been fascinating for a South African 
audience.

We knew everything they told us without having to pay for Peter Hain to fly business class.’

Earlier this week, it was revealed the 
BBC has flown a total of 140 journalists and production staff to South 
Africa since Mr Mandela died aged 95 last Thursday, nearly three times 
as many as all its rival British broadcasters put together.

Sky News sent 15 staff, ITV and Channel 4 each sent nine, and Channel 5 sent four.

According to an analysis by the Daily 
Mail, a total of 104 special programmes devoted to Mandela will have 
been aired on the BBC’s main radio and TV channels by the time of his 
funeral tomorrow.

The news of his death has also topped almost every news bulletin for a week, dominated current affairs shows such as Newsnight, and has been screened almost continuously on BBC News 24.

Mr Burns said: ‘It has got to the stage where we are being told “Breaking News – Mandela is still dead”. They are losing all sense of proportion.’

Over the past week, BBC1 and BBC2 have carried a series of live programmes – totalling more than 21 hours of screen time, covering every moment of every ceremony.

On Tuesday, five hours were devoted to his memorial service, a further four hours was allocated to coverage of his coffin being laid in state the following day, and today BBC2 will report on the transfer of his coffin to his childhood village.

Another extended programme will cover his funeral tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Radio 5 Live commissioned more than 48 hours of programming, there was another ten hours on Radio 4, and 27 hours on the World Service.

Thursday’s Question Time – hosted by David Dimbleby – was originally scheduled to be filmed in Swansea, but was moved to Johannesburg instead. The BBC refused to reveal the cost of flights for him and eight staff.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It just proves how overfunded the BBC is if they can spend money on this kind of largesse. The BBC is spending other people’s money and that is why it doesn’t matter to them.

‘They are spending the money of many people who are struggling to pay their licence fee.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Nelson Mandela was a hugely significant world leader. His death has been of considerable interest to millions of people watching and listening to the BBC at home and across the globe.’

He added: ‘Peter Hain was an integral part of the panel, bringing the UK government’s involvement into the wider story. We felt his inclusion was important and so we did pay for his flights but we kept costs as low as we could.’
