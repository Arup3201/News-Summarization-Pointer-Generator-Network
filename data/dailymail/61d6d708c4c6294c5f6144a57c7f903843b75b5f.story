A horse named Spartacus fell over near Central Park on Wednesday, adding fuel to the debate over whether the carriage industry should remain in New York City.

Those siding with Mayor Bill De Blasio's plan to ban horse-drawn carriages and replace them with electric cars gathered Thursday at the site of the accident to protest what they believe is a cruel industry.

'We are here today because yesterday eyewitnesses report that a bus drove very close to a carriage, spooking a horse who then began to run,' PETA spokeswoman Ashley Byrne said at the demonstration Thursday afternoon.

Toppled: A carriage horse named Spartacus fell in Central Park on Wednesday. Animal rights activists claim the 15-year-old horse was spooked by a passing bus

Doing fine: A carriage industry spokesman said 
the accident had nothing to do with a bus and that Spartacus was 
inspected by a veterinarian who determined the animal was uninjured

'After the horse bucked and started to run the carriage tipped over onto the curb, pinning the horse down. This is more tragic evidence of why it is time to take these dangerous cruel carriages off the streets of New York City,' Ms Byrne added.

However, spokesman for the carriage industry maintains that the 15-year-old horse was not injured in the 'minor accident' and that buses don't even drive by E 59th Street and Fifth Avenue where the incident happened.

Instead, they say a horse parked behind Spartacus unexpectedly pulled out of its spot and clipped Spartacus' back Wheel and tipped the carriage over - causing Spartacus to fall.

Agenda: New York Mayor Bill De Blasio has expressed his intention to ban the carriage industry and replace them with electric cars

'Several carriage drivers immediately came to the horse's aid, keeping him calm and laying down while they unharnessed him, got him untangled and righted the lightweight carriage before safely allowing him to get to his feet,' the Historic Horse Drawn Carriages of Central Park, LLC said in a statement.

After the incident, Spartacus was taken to his stable in Midtown where he rested and was evaluated by a veterinarian.

On Thursday, Spartacus' owner brandished Tony Salerno, 62, brandished a clean veterinarian's check and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene confirm that the horse was not injured.

Still, the accident only heightened tension on the issue and even Mayor De Blasio commented it at an unrelated event on Thursday.

'The one yesterday was not the first one -- it was one in a long line of accidents," De Blasio said.'And it's for a very simple reason -- horses don't belong on the streets of New York City.

While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'.

That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious ad campaign against Christine Quinn - his main Democrat rival.

De Blasio got another supporter as well in the form of Broadway actress Kristen Chenoweth who tweeted Thursday: 'Please NYC. Let's get these horses off [the] street !!'

Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city

Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed.

'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times.

Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'.

While four horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic.

And Neeson certainly isn't alone in wanting to keep the horses. A 'Save our Horses' petition started by the New York Daily News has garnered more than 20,000 signatures as of Thursday.

On the same day as the accident, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy took his wife Carla Bruni and their daughter Giulia out for a ride on one of the carriages and all three smiled the entire time.

After the ride, when asked if he thought the carriage industry should remain in New York, Sarkozy offered up an enthusiastic 'yes,' the Daily News reported.
