Manchester United's hopes of signing Edinson Cavani hinge on the club retaining their Champions League status.

The Uruguayan features highly on manager David Moyes' summer transfer hitlist as he looks to rebuild his struggling team.

But Cavani is unsure whether a summer move to Old Trafford represents a forward step in his career.Playing Champions League football was a key factor for Cavani when he moved from Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain last summer.

Target: Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani is Manchester United's main transfer target this summer

Unsure: But the Uruguayan hotshot won't move to Old Trafford without the offer of Champions League football

Prestige: The former Napoli striker is considering leaving PSG but wants to remain in Europe's top competition

And keeping his status among Europe's elite players remains imperative for the 27-year-old.

Manchester United's chances of staying in the competition next season are slim; they are 2-0 down in their last-16 tie against Olympiakos and 12 points adrift of a top-four place in the Barclays Premier League.

The sheer cost of the deal would also prove a major stumbling block toward a potential move to United.

Disappointment: Man United suffered a humiliating 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool over the weekend

PSG will look to recoup the majority of the £55million they spent on Cavani last summer. Likewise, the player will demand a minimum of £6.7m-per-season, after tax, in wages should he decide to leave France this summer.

Cavani's complicated ownership issues will also add more pounds to the total fee, with a number of agents and advisers eager to get a slice of the lucrative pie.

Arsenal are monitoring Hamburg attacking midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu.

The 20-year-old, who has been likened to current Gunners star Mesut Ozil, has earned rave reviews in Germany following a number of impressive displays and scored an outrageous free-kick against Borussia Dortmund last month.

He has already been capped by the Turkey national team and is set to play a key role in their Euro 2016 qualification campaign.

And Gunners spies are making regular checks on Calhanoglu's progress with a view to a future move.

Hamburg would demand around £15m for the youngster this summer, with Liverpool also keeping tabs on their player.

Prospect: The 20 year-old has already notched eight Bundesliga goals for Hamburg this season

Heads up: The German-born Turkish midfielder has already represented the Turkey national team

Under instruction from Arsene Wenger, Arsenal have ramped up their scouting network in Germany in recent months.

And the Gunners are set to raid Germany yet again this summer with moves for Calhanoglu and Schalke wonderkid Julian Draxler in the pipeline.

Tottenham need convincing that Burnley hotshot Danny Ings has what it takes to become a top Premier League striker.

Ings has been a revelation in the Championship this season, scoring 25 goals for Sean Dyche's men so far.

His displays have attracted major interest from the top-flight; with Spurs among the clubs monitoring Ings on a weekly basis.

Main man: Ings was just this weekend named as the Sky Bet Player of the Year for the Championship

Prolific: Ings has already notched 25 goals this season as Burnley go in search of Premier League promotion

Spurs chiefs have been impressed with Ings but there remains doubt among the club's hierarchy about how he would adapt to life towards the top of the England's top league.

With Burnley set to secure automatic promotion, Ings is likely to play in the top-flight next season regardless.

Liverpool, Stoke and West Brom are among the sides to have watched Ings at various junctures this season.

Leicester have identified Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni as a potential candidate to replace Kasper Schmeichel.

Foxes boss Nigel Pearson fears Schmeichel will leave the club this summer, despite their pending promotion into the top-flight, when his contract expires.

The club are trying to nail down the 27-year-old's long-term future, but Pearson has begun the process of finding a replacement in case a deal cannot be reached.

And Speroni has emerged as a prime contender should Schmeichel depart.

The Argentine himself is out of contract in the summer, though talks are ongoing over fresh terms.Palace are keen to keep Speroni, 34, and are ready to offer him coaching opportunities at the club as a carrot to sign a new deal.

But his future as first-choice keeper is far from secure after the arrival of Wayne Hennessey in January.

AC Milan are understood to be keen on taking Schmeichel on a free transfer. 

Charlton manager Jose Riga is set to revive the club's interest in Derek Boateng.

The Fulham midfielder has been on Charlton's radar for a number of weeks, but sacked manager Chris Powell decided against signing Boateng.

But with Powell departed, a loan move for the Ghanaian is back on the cards at The Valley.
