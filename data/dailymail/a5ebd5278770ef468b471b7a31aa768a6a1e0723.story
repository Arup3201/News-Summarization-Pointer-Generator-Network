The Royal Navy’s £1billion new hunter-killer submarine is riddled with technical problems and cannot sprint away from an attack, it was claimed last night.

HMS Astute, supposed to be the most advanced ever built in Britain, has suffered problems with the propulsion which means it cannot reach its top speed.

One source described the vessel as having 'a V8 engine with a Morris Minor gearbox'.

Warship: The Royal Navy submarine HMS Astute has been beset by design issues

The nuclear-powered submarine, which 
is the first of a set of seven and is not yet formally ready, was 'launched' in 2007 by its patron the Duchess of Cornwall.

But the warship - dubbed 'HMS Calamity' - has since been beset by misfortune - including a navigation 
error which led to it running aground in 2010, and the murder of an 
officer on-board in 2011 by a junior member of the crew.

Yesterday a catalogue of technical failings were also revealed, including complaints that the periscope does not provide good enough images.

The Guardian said there had been
complaints that the periscope, which goes up and down but carries a camera to beam pictures down into the vessel, was simply projecting images of waves washing over the camera.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had stated that the submarine would be able to make 29 knots, but it has reportedly failed to achieve this.

The issue is said to have been caused because - rather than building a new power plant for Astute - the MoD opted to use the reactor used in the much bigger Vanguard-class Trident submarines.

HMS Astute also had to perform an emergency surfacing during a routine dive because of flooding, the Guardian reported.

Other concerns highlighted include corrosion and the replacement or moving of computer circuit boards because they did not meet safety standards.

The MoD confirmed the latter had not been fitted according to Naval Engineering Standards and have since been reinstalled.

Responding to corrosion problems, which were identified on Astute and the second Astute class submarine HMS Ambush, a spokesman said: 'All Royal Navy submarines are subject to a continuous, thorough assessment of their components to minimise the risk of corrosion.'

Concerns were also raised over the wrong type of lead being used in its nuclear reactor monitoring instruments, although the MoD said it would have no effect on the accuracy of any readings or any impact on the submarine's operation.

On the issue of the submarine's propulsion and speed, the authority said it would not comment, although it explained any issues would be examined and used to improve the other submarines in production.

The spokesman added: 'HMS Astute’s sea trials were designed to rigorously test all aspects of the submarine to meet the exacting standards required for operations.

‘It is normal for first of class 
trials to identify areas where modifications are required and these are 
then incorporated into later vessels of the class.

‘These will be the most 
technologically advanced submarines ever to serve with the Royal Navy 
and will provide an outstanding capability for decades to come.’

It
is understood that the leakage incident, which happened during 
exercises off the east coast of the United States, saw several litres of
sea water entering the submarine

A
Ministry of Defence spokesman said of the incident: 'During 
trials last year HMS Astute experienced a leak which was immediately 
isolated and the submarine returned safely to the surface.

'An investigation found one small part which had not been made of the correct material had corroded.

'A replacement was fitted at sea and the submarine continued with her programme.

'BAE Systems has carried out a full assessment which concluded all similar parts were fitted correctly.'

Each of the the seven vessels, which are all due to be completed in 
2024, costs £1.3billion.

With their new capabilities, they have been designed to progressively replace the Trafalgar Class currently in service.

HMS Astute is yet to start formal service.

The HMS Astute is the first of new seven boats designed to bring the Royal Navy into a new era of seafaring.

Eight were originally commissioned, but only seven will be made due to budget restrictions.

The National Audit Office (NAO)  last year warned of the spiralling cost of the Astute programme.

HMS Astute was supposed to have been 
launched in 2005, but technical difficulties pushed back its completion until 2009.

The NAO are predicting the programme is now 
almost £2bn over budget.

It also said that each of the Astute class submarines will 
be 28 months late, with the seventh boat not being in service for 
another decade.

BAE Systems, which is responsible for 
building the Astute fleet, told the Guardian: 'Safety is of paramount 
importance to every stage of the design, build, test and trials of a 
submarine and is at the heart of everything we do.

'Before entering full service, every 
submarine is required to complete an exhaustive period of sea trials, 
which are designed to prove the vessel's capabilities.

'These trials also present an 
opportunity to improve performance by resolving any issues that may come
to light during this time, which is not uncommon on a first-of-class 
submarine.'

The technical failings are the latest in a series of misfortunes in the ship's short history.

When it ran aground in October 2010, it emerged the commander was taking a shower only minutes before.

The embarrassing detail was included in an official inquiry which found a catalogue of errors had led to the incident.

It was also revealed the officer on the bridge at the time was not using the correct radar, did not have a chart and was not used to navigating in the dark.

The Navy's humiliation was compounded when a rescue vessel crashed into HMS Astute, causing even more damage.

The cost of repairs to the sub is understood to have run into hundreds of millions of pounds.

Nobody was court martialled over the 
incident, but the Navy said three officers had been disciplined. The 
Ministry of Defence refused to name those who were blamed, but Cdr 
Coles, 47, lost his post a month after the incident.

Last
year, Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan, admitted murdering Lt Cdr Ian 
Molyneux, 36, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, on the submarine.

Sentencing him, a judge at Winchester Crown Court told Donovan, 22, of Hillside Road, Dartford, Kent, that he must serve at least 25 years .

Donovan also admitted the attempted murders of Lt Cdr Hodge, 45, Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37.

The court heard how he was resentful after after being told he would not be attached to the 
Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Cardigan Bay because he had disobeyed orders to clean 
part of the submarine.

The incident cast a shadow over a ship that was intended as the forebear of a new generation of billion pound machines set to bring the Royal Navy into the 21st century.

In spite of being four years late and £900million over-budget, HMS Astute was hailed a technological marvel when she was first unveiled to the public in 2007.

With machinery more complex than a space shuttle, and the ability to circumnavigate the globe without surfacing, the 7,400-ton piece of equipment was the largest and deadliest hunter-killer submarine ever built.

As long as a football pitch, at 318ft, and as wide as four double-decker buses, it was a third longer than any sub which had gone before.

In spite of its speed, the stealth warship makes less noise than a baby dolphin, making it undetectable to enemy ships.

Her sonar is so advanced that if she was lying in the English Channel she would be able to detect ships leaving New York harbour 3,000 nautical miles away, although the details of how this is done are classified.

The sub carries 38 Tomahawk cruise missiles, with a range of 1,240 miles, and can attack targets in North Africa with pinpoint accuracy while sitting off the coast of Plymouth.

The technical failings of HMS Astute are the latest in a series of errors and controversial decisions by ministers in charge of state protection.
