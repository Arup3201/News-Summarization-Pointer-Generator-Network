Brain cancer patient Ashya King has recovered to such a degree that his family hope he will soon be walking unaided.

The five-year-old, whose parents sparked an international manhunt and fears for his life when they took him out of hospital to seek treatment abroad, is making ‘steady progress’ four months after undergoing pioneering proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic.

Writing on the family’s Facebook page, Ashya’s older brother, Naveed, said: ‘Ashya’s progress is steady and hopefully soon he can make his first step alone.’

Ashya’s parents, Brett and Naghmeh, whisked him from Southampton General Hospital last August, boarded a ferry and drove 1,300 miles to their Spanish holiday home. Their plan was to sell the property to fund the proton beam therapy, which costs at least £50,000.

Ashya underwent 30 therapy sessions in Prague in September and October. His parents feared the NHS treatment he was due to receive, combining ‘conventional’ radiotherapy and chemotherapy, would have damaging side effects.

Proton beam therapy typically causes less damage to surrounding healthy tissue. His UK doctors argued it would bring no extra benefits – but the NHS did eventually pay for his treatment in Prague.

Ashya also underwent an operation to remove his tumour last summer, appearing very weak afterwards. But now he has recovered to such an extent that he is behaving like a normal, boisterous five-year-old, according to worshippers at the church the family attends in San Pedro de Alcantara, near Marbella. One described him as ‘full of life – and even arguing with his parents’.

Meanwhile, leading doctors are warning that Ministers are about to squander £250 million because the equipment chosen for two proton beam treatment centres in the UK is based on ‘old technology’.

Cancer expert Professor Karol Sikora said the enormous facilities, in London and Manchester, could soon be ‘concrete mausoleums’, while leading obstetrician Sir Marcus Setchell, who delivered Prince George, said the NHS should ‘seriously consider’ newer designs.

The NHS has all but chosen Hitachi to supply machines for two centres, but the experts argue that newer, smaller units are available.

Prof Sikora said: ‘It’s illogical to go for the big machines today. It’s old technology, basically, and it’s been superseded.’ He claimed the NHS was being over-cautious and was a victim of its own ‘unbelievably slow’ buying process.

The Department of Health said it was satisfied the best equipment was being bought.
