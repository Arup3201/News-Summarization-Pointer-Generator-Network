Facebook, owned by Mark Zuckerberg, has been accused of 'refusing to listen' to the voice of the British public 

Facebook 'refused to listen to the voice' of the British public by channelling profits through Ireland to avoid  the taxman in the UK, an MP said last night.

The move by the social network meant it paid just £1.8million in Irish tax on more than £2.3billion of global sales, but none in Britain.

The accusation came as details of the social network's efforts to avoid paying UK tax emerged, just days after Chancellor George Osborne announced a crackdown on multinational companies using 'elaborate structures' to avoid paying up.

Around 46 per cent (£2.35billion) of Facebook's global sales where channelled through Ireland - allowing the company to make profits of £2.3billion. 

Its tax bill was reduced further by paying £2.29billion in 'administrative expenses' to Facebook's parent company, The Guardian reported.

Shifting the money meant Mark Zuckerberg's company only paid the equivalent of £1.81million in Irish tax on taxable profits of £5.76million.

By channelling its UK sales through Ireland, Facebook has avoided paying any tax in Britain for two years running - despite 33 million Brits having accounts.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said Facebook was 'still refusing to listen to the voice of public opinion'.

She added that the social network appeared to be 'using elaborate corporate structures and artificial devices for no purpose other than to avoid tax'.

Ms Hodge said: 'We have to take tough to crack down on this behaviour, and the UK should be leading the way on this issue.'

The UK boss of Starbucks, which has only paid £8.6m tax despite making £3billion in British sales since it first opened its doors in 1998, also admitted this week that it would not start paying corporation tax for the next three years.

Google paid £20m in UK tax last year despite its British revenue totalling £5.6billion.

Facebook paid just £1.8million in tax on more than £2.3billion of advert sales channelled through Ireland, avoiding the UK taxman for the second year running

Chancellor George Osborne, in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday, announced a measure, dubbed the 'Google tax', which will impose a 25 per cent levy on profits shifted abroad by multinational companies.

It is hoped that the measure will raise more than £1billion over the next five years. 

He said: 'Some of the largest companies in the world, including those in the tech sector, use elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes.

'That's not fair to other British firms. It's not fair to British people either. Today we're putting a stop to it. My message is consistent and clear: low taxes, but low taxes that will be paid.' 

Facebook have been contacted for comment.
