If you thought the weather forecast was too good to be true, you were probably right.

The BBC has been forced to apologise on air for ignoring official weather predictions and forecasting sun when rain was on the way.

Forecasters stuck to their own assessment of the weather and disregarded stormy warnings from the Met Office –  and as a result, many viewers were caught unawares when the heavens opened in parts of the country yesterday.

Wet: Festival-goers at the V Festival in Staffordshire endured soggy conditions while temperatures soared across southern Britain to 30C. Weatherman Philip Avery made an embarrassed apology for the errors

Yesterday afternoon, weatherman Philip Avery made an embarrassed apology for the errors on the BBC News channel.

He admitted: ‘There are thunderstorms which were not represented in our  forecasts over the past couple of days or so.

'I have to say we can’t even blame the computers, the computers actually wanted to put those thunderstorms in there but forecasters thought that it wasn’t supported by enough evidence and so we went for the dry, hot option.

‘Having said that, apologies to anyone who has had their next few hours ruined.’

Ominous: Dark clouds were seen as rain delayed play during the Third Investec Test Match at Lord's Cricket Ground in London yesterday

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The weather team always endeavour to be open about forecasting and it was right to explain why today’s forecast didn’t capture weather events in some regions.

‘This was done following discussions with Met Office colleagues.’ While those in the south yesterday might not have minded the odd refreshing shower, those in the north were probably less thrilled.

Temperatures soared to 30C (86F) in southern areas, but the rest of the country had a gloomy day of cloud and showers.

An estimated half a million flocked to beaches at Brighton and Bournemouth to enjoy the hottest weekend of the year.

The mercury hit 32.4C (90.32F) at the village of Cavendish in Suffolk on Saturday, and early indications were that yesterday was not far behind in the south east. A high of 30.6C (87.1F) was reached in Cambridge, and 30C (86F) in London.

Out in force: Brighton beach did not take long to fill out when the sun made an appearance this weekend

But across the north, west and Wales, temperatures were just 22C (72F) at best, although still above the 21C (70F) average for the time of year.

There was surface water flooding in places, and a heavy band of rain over the Midlands in the afternoon left the 150,000 attending the V Festival in Staffordshire drenched. Yet back in the south, supermarkets saw bumper sales of ice cream and barbecue meat. In London, tourists jumped into Trafalgar Square to cool off, and England’s cricketers sweltered against South Africa at Lord’s.

In Wigan and Manchester, however, conditions were rather breezier for footballers playing their first match of the season.

It will remain very warm in the south east and east of England today with a high of 25C (77F), but will again be slightly cooler in northern and western areas.

Temperatures will fall back to a more typical 22C (72F) across southern England by Wednesday and rain will be moving in towards the Bank Holiday weekend.
