A Chinese street food seller and father-of-one was executed today in China, despite a backlash from thousands of people.

Xia Junfeng's death sentence was carried out today, despite two appeals, after the man was convicted of murdering two officials who were stopping him from trading.

After losing his job at a government-run factory, Xia had taken to grilling kebabs and sausages on a street in Shengyang, north-eastern China.

He was found guilty of the murders by Shenyang Intermediate People's Court, which dismissed claims that he had acted in self-defence after heavy-handed officials repeatedly beat him.

A group of 25 human rights lawyers in China objected to the punishment, saying that the case was too uncertain and that the Chinese Supreme Court should have stopped the sentence.

It said: 'We protest that the Supreme Court ratified the death sentence and ordered an immediate execution in a case where doubts remain.'

Xia's wife Zhang Jing led a vocal protest against her husband's punishment, including a failed appeal to the Chinese supreme court.

Images painted by their 12-year-old son showing cartoon versions of himself and his father together were widely shared in social media posts protesting his innocence.

Today Zhang said :'I swear I will not cry again, so that my dear man can go in peace.'

Xia stabbed the two officials - known as chengguan - in May 2009 after he was taken into a room by the men, whose job it is to regulate street traders. His business did not have a licence.

He claimed that the chengguan - who are known for being heavy-handed in their work - provoked him to the attack by beating him on the street.

But the court threw out the claim and convicted him of murder, saying it could see no evidence that he was beaten.

Death sentences in China must all be approved by the Supreme Court, but a passionate appeal by his family, which argued that there are still too many unanswered questions in the case, was quashed.

A statement released today by the Shenyang court which convicted Xia said that the Supreme Court approving the death penalty was proof they considered his crime 'vile' and 'extremely cruel'.

However, the move provoked a huge backlash, leading to Xia's name being the most-searched topic on Chinese social media site Weibo today.

Those who disagree with the harsh sentence have contrasted Xia's case with that of Gu Kailai, the wife of prominent politican Bo Xilai, who was last week sentenced to prison for corruption.

Gu pleaded guilty last year to the murder of Neil Heywood, a British businessman with whom she said a commercial disagreement.

Despite admitting that her murder was premeditated, it is likely Gu's death sentence will be reduced to life in prison.

Yao Bo, a prominent commentator in China, said: 'I am no legal expert, but I know a simple rule: If Gu Kailai can be spared of her life for a premeditated murder, then Xia Junfeng should not die.'

Author Yi Chen declared 'justice is dead' in response to the punishment, adding: 'His life and death are more than just a legal matter, but a bellwether of the era, with the tsunami-like public opinion firmly on the side of Xia Junfeng'.

Legal experts have pointed to holes in the prosecution's case, including contradictory statements and a lack of credible witnesses.

Wang Jianxun, a professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, said the outcome amounted to 'legal regression.'

'The legal system clearly has taken the side of the urban management,' Wang said. â€˜This is an unjust verdict.'
