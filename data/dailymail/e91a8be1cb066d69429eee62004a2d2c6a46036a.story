A high school football star who was a passenger in his mother's car has died after she tried to pass another vehicle but lost control and  slammed into trees.

Branden Denis, 16, and his mother's boyfriend, 35-year-old dad-of-three Eric Morey, were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Bridgton, Maine at 5.50pm on Sunday.

But his mother, 34-year-old Candice Tucker, survived the wreck with minor injuries and is in fair condition in Maine Medical Center in Portland, the Portland Press Herald reported.

Police said that it appears excessive speed contributed to the crash. It is not yet known if they were wearing seatbelts and there is no word yet on whether Tucker will face charges.

At Gorham High School on Monday, football teammates and staff paid tribute to the starting lineman, remembering him as a devoted, hardworking team player and a gentle giant.

Before football practice on Monday, some teammates put Denis' number, 64, in athletic tape on the locker room door, while others displayed his jersey and football cleats.

The boys entered school with mixed emotions, the Press Herald reported; just two days before the crash, the team had won its first game in more than two years.

'Branden was an old fashioned Maine boy,' Football coach Andy Hager told WMTW. 'He worked as hard as he could every single day he showed up every single day. He encouraged everyone

Tribute: Members of the football team made a shrine featuring his jersey, cleats and helmet at school

'He never put a single person down and was someone everyone rallied behind... He was truly someone that was part of the entire community of Gorham.'

Relatives gathered to mourn their loss at Denis' paternal grandparents, Kevin and Susan Denis.

'He gave the greatest hugs you ever had,' Michelle DeBruin, a great aunt, told the Press Herald.

'He was a sweet, loving young man… He had a heart of gold.'

They remembered how the teen, who towered at 6ft 4, was a great big brother to his younger siblings and how he enjoyed hunting with his father, David.

Tucker has been in a handful of crashes before and had her license revoked in 2005 for being a habitual traffic offender, including tickets for speeding, the Press Herald reported.

She later faced charges of driving on a revoked license and later was charged with driving an uninspected vehicle, records show.

She has also been involved in two crashes - including when she improperly passed another vehicle in 2005, although no one was hurt.

She was charged in that incident with leaving the scene of an accident and driving on a suspended license.
