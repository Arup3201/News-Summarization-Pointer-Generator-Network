Juan Mata has been unveiled as Manchester United's new No 8.

It was expected that the Spaniard would take the iconic Old Trafford No 7 shirt, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham, George Best and Eric Cantona.

But the £37million playmaker has taken No 8, last worn by Anderson, now on loan at Fiorentina sparking Twitter rumours the No 7 was reserved for the return of Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer.

Mata completed
 his move to Old Trafford over the weekend and manager Moyes desperately
 needs him to help turn around a poor season that sees United out of the
 two domestic cup competitions and 14 points off the pace in the 
Barclays Premier League.

United boss Moyes never truly believed he would be able to snap up the Spaniard from Premier League rivals Chelsea, revealing there would be more players of his calibre on the way to Old Trafford.

Moyes said: 'I'm thrilled. I got wind a month or so ago that it could be a possibility. I never really believed I'd pull it off.

The red Juan: the Spaniard insisted he is up to the challenge of playing for 'massive club' Man United

'When we heard Juan would be available we went after him. Congratulations to the club and Ed Woodward for getting it done.'

The former Chelsea man, meanwhile, revealed his delight at joining his new side after what he called a 'difficult' final six months at Stamford Bridge.

'I just wanted to go to a place where I knew I would be happy. I'm really happy now,' the new signing said.

'Man United is a massive club, with the most fans around the world and so it is a big challenge. It is a big step and everything will be fine with this squad and the players that will come in the summer.

'I think No 8 is a great number. I 
know that seven is an iconic number here and I spoke to David [Moyes] 
about it but we decided eight was the number for me.'

Mata
 also pointed to the chance to play with Wayne Rooney as a major factor 
in his move, with the England striker linked with Chelsea last summer.

He said: 'I can't wait to play alongside him. He is one of the best players in the
 history of this country - he can score, can assist and come to the 
midfield to win the ball.

'He is an unbelievable player. I will try to 
find to find the gaps on the pitch. I will try to assist the strikers.'

Sidelined: Mata admitted to having a 'difficult' final six months at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho

Mata recognised his new side's troubles this season, saying: 'The team is really good but they have had some unlucky moments. Hopefully it will be better until the end of the season.

'What I like the most about this club is the character. If another club 
was in this position in the league, they would not have the character to
 get back to first position. They fight until the end.

'They always try 
to win titles, fighting for every title and always coming back from 
difficult moments.'

Being benched under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea was also harming Mata's World Cup ambitions with Spain, an issue he is determined to remedy with the move to Old Trafford.

National pride: Mata said the move was crucial for his hopes to play for Spain at the World Cup

'It was really important [for my World Cup ambitions]. It is really hard to get into the Spanish squad.

'It is a great chance to keep playing, keep fit and show to the manager to the national team I want to be there.

'Now the moment is here, I will try to play as much as I can and help the team. If things are good in the last part of the season, my chances will be good.'
