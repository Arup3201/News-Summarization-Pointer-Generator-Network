With her golden Armenian skin, almond eyes and glossy hair, Kim Kardashian is widely regarded as one of the world's most beautiful women - but even she looks to others for  inspiration.

Despite their starkly contrasting looks, the global star has revealed that English rose Kate Moss is her beauty icon.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the 34-year-old said: 'I love Kate Moss. I love how she wears her winged eyeliner and her messy hair and how it looks so effortless but still put together. It looks beachy and messy at the same time; I love her glamour.'

Kim was speaking at the UK launch of Hairfinity, a haircare vitamin complex that promises healthier, longer and stronger hair from within. She and her sister Khloe, who joined her at the event, are big fans of the brand - and Kim credits the £24 product with giving her the hair of her dreams.  

'I've tried so many things and I really genuinely love this product. I take two pills in the morning with my vitamins and it works for me.'

Kim explained how the supplement, for which she and Khloe are ambassadors, helped her baby hairs grow back after she had them lasered off.

'I wanted some back, I wish I hadn't lasered so much off and when I started taking this supplement, they started growing back the perfect amount so that made me really happy.'

What's your secret? The famous sisters revealed that they swear by coconut oil and Kim loves a tan because she says it makes her look slimmer

Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 

'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.'

Kim added: 'As far as products, I love anything from a Neutrogena face wipe to the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have coming out. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.'

Taking tips: Both sisters tale advice from youngest family member Kylie, who they say is amazing at doing her make-up, despite it only taking her fifteen minutes 

The beauty buffs were the ones who put contouring on the map - and their love of the make-up trick is still going strong.

'Contouring is the best. It's amazing, once you start, you can't stop,' said Khloe. 'Sometimes people will say: "Oh, you've got a nose job" but I just forgot to contour!'.

Kim, meanwhile, swears by having a golden glow. She said: 'Tanning is everything, I tan all the time and I do the beds because I have psoriasis so it really helps with that and I just think when you tan, it makes you look so much skinnier.'

She also revealed that husband Kanye likes it when she experiments with different looks - but the girls generally agree that men aren't a fan of coloured, bright lips.

As well as taking inspiration from Kate Moss, Kim learns a lot from her little sister, Kylie Jenner.

Speaking about her 17-year-old sister, she said: 'I live with Kylie so every time she's putting on her lashes or putting on her lip liner, I ask her for advice and how she does it so perfectly. She is so good at make-up.'

Khloe agrees, adding: 'Sophia Loren is my icon but I also love my little sister Kylie and what she does with her make-up. Her hair is really funky and cool.'

Despite the youngest Keeping Up With The Kardashians star being criticised for her pouty social media snaps, Khloe says that Kylie is actually really low maintenance. 

Helping hand: Khloe cites Kylie as one of her beauty icons and says she always looks so natural

'I swear her make-up takes her fifteen minutes, she does it all the time and it doesn't take her long and it looks so natural. It doesn't look like she's piled it on.'

The sisters were only in London for less than 24 hours but they still managed to do two of their favourite things in the city - eating and shopping.

'London is one of our favourite places,' they said. 'It has the best restaurants, we ate at Cut on 45 Park Lane and had soup and truffle risotto - it was amazing.'

'The shopping is also amazing, from Dover Street to Selfridges, Kim was salivating over the shops,' laughed Khloe. 

Fresh from their whirlwind trip to London, the sisters attended French Montana's star-studded 30th Birthday Party Powered by CIROC Pineapple in Los Angeles.
