Scotland vs England was a good tear-up on Tuesday night, but I cannot wait for the return of the Barclays Premier League and this is a fixture that has me licking my lips. 

They may not be the heavyweights of old, slugging it out at the top of the table, but Arsenal and Manchester United are still ferocious rivals. 

Here are the five key areas that will decide the contest. Make no mistake about it, this is a big game.

Sanchez and Welbeck vs the fragile United defence

United have terrible injuries, not helped by a lack of investment in defence, while Arsenal’s two attacking signings are in good form, especially Alexis Sanchez. He has 12 goals for the club and hasn’t required time to settle.

The biggest concern is how quickly he can recover from his recent international exploits, with matches for Chile against Venezuela and Uruguay. He isn’t due back at Arsenal until Friday and Arsene Wenger must decide if he is fatigued, or fit enough to try and continue his explosive form.

If Danny Welbeck is fit after picking up a hamstring injury on England duty, this will be a huge game for him. He will be motivated after being written off by Louis van Gaal and will relish this fixture. I’d still like to see him further up the pitch and finishing chances in the box, but he looks at home at Arsenal. I wonder if he’ll celebrate if he scores?

Di Maria vs Chambers

My training ground sources at Arsenal tell me that Arsene Wenger sees Calum Chambers as a defensive midfielder eventually. Right now, he is having to stand in at right back and was given a real chasing in Arsenal's last game against Swansea by winger Jefferson Montero. He also found himself second-choice behind Nathaniel Clyne with England.

But he’s a young man with lots of ability and I am a huge fan. He comes face to face with dynamic Angel di Maria, who looks to be off his game at the moment. If he is fit – he too took a knock on international duty – he owes United a big performance, because he has been flat recently. 

After three goals and four assists in his first six games, he has only one assist in his last three. He hasn’t been helped with the changing of his position. Since moving out to the left wing, he hasn’t contributed as much. He clearly wants to play through the middle.

What system will LVG pick?

He’s chopping and changing his formation at the moment and it’s confusing his own players, more than the opposition. People praise a manager who changes his formation mid-game to impact on the result, but it only proves he got the formation wrong in the first place.

Will United play with a diamond? Will it be three at the back? Or maybe 4-4-2? Where will he play Di Maria? Van Gaal has had rotten luck with injuries, especially in the back line, and he will probably have to play with a rookie pairing at Arsenal. His reputation is giving him breathing space.

Where will Jack play (if he starts)?

Jack Wilshere will probably wish to play in the deep midfield position. He’s done well there for England, but Arsenal have more competition for places. Wilshere has also played better for England this season than he has for his club. 

Wenger doesn’t seem to agree with Roy Hodgson’s assessment of Wilshere’s best role, so can he force his way into the team higher up the pitch? I agree with Wenger; I like to see Jack playing one-twos around the opposition box, but there are question marks about his energy levels.

RVP is under pressure

There are growing questions being raised about Robin van Persie. He no longer has the centre forward role to himself, with Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao - who is out for two weeks with a fresh injury - breathing down his neck.

Some people are too keen to withdraw Rooney, either into midfield or behind the striker, but he showed against Scotland that he still has much to offer up front. Is he a better pick than Van Persie in United’s No 9 position?

The former Arsenal striker seems to have lost some pace and is no longer the same force. Will he celebrate if he scores against his old club? You bet he will. Arsenal’s defence is not at its best and this is a chance for him to show he still has what it takes.
