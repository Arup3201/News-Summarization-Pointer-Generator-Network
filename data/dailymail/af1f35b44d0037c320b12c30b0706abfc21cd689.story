A Mexican man once listed as the world's heaviest human has been cremated after dying on Monday at the age of 48.

The body of Manuel Uribe was brought to the Serorrey funeral home aboard a flat-bed truck, on the same special bed where he spent much of the last decade.

Funeral home director Pedro Reyes said Serorrey's cremation facility was the only one in the northern city of Monterrey able to handle Uribe's body.

Reyes said Tuesday the oven temperature was set about 60 percent higher than normal.

A religious service was held Tuesday for Uribe. Plans for the ashes weren't clear.

Uribe had slimmed down to about 867 pounds (394 kilograms), after his peak weight of 1,230 pounds (560 kilograms) was certified in 2006 as a Guinness World Record.

He had been confined to his bed in Monterrey for years, unable to walk on his own.

Uribe had 
been taken to the hospital on May 2 because of an abnormal heartbeat.

He had to be taken to the hospital with a crane by emergency and civil defense workers.

Doctors
 have not yet certified the cause of death. In addition to the cardiac 
condition, Uribe was also believed to have suffered from liver problems.

Uribe married Claudia Solis in 2008, and the wedding was one of the few times he left his home in recent years.

After years of diet, exercise and medical care, Uribe, had lost more than 550 pounds by the ceremony.

He
 had hoped to walk down the aisle, but despite his dramatic weight loss,
 he was transported to the ceremony on a flatbed truck and remained in 
his custom-made bed, according to The Associated Press.

Uribe shed tears during the ceremony and embraced his then-38-year-old bride for a 'first dance' but didn't indulge in wedding cake.

'He didn't break his diet,' Uribe's mother said.

'I have a wife and will form a new family and live a happy life,' Uribe told reporters before the ceremony for 400 guests.

He had been married prior to Solis, when he weighed 280 pounds, Uribe was married.

But as he grew more obese, he said the relationship grew increasingly difficult.

'She asked me for a divorce,' he said. 'I was very depressed.'

Uribe
 was a chubby kid, weighing more than 250 pounds as an 
adolescent.

Starting in 1992, he said, his weight began ballooning 
further.

In 2007, Uribe told ABC News: 'I had an obesity problem for many years, a very significant one. I was gaining and gaining weight. I was on every diet you can imagine.'

'I used to eat normal, just like all Mexicans do... beans, rice, flour tortilla, corn tortilla, French fries, hamburgers, subs and pizzas, whatever regular people eat. I worked as a technician, repairing typewriters, electronic calculators and computers. So I worked on a chair. It was a sedentary life,' he said.

But his weight got out of hand. Since the summer of 2002, Uribe had been bedridden, relying on his mother and friends to feed and clean him.
