Diego Lopez's transfer from Real Madrid to AC Milan is '99 per cent' complete, according to Adriano Galliani.

Reports in Italy suggested he had rejected offers from Arsenal and Liverpool to move to Milan, who have also signed goalkeeper Michael Agazzi on a free transfer from Chievo.

Galliani, AC Milan's CEO and vice-president, told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'The deal for Diego Lopez has been 99 per cent completed.'

Lopez had played regularly at Real since Jose Mourinho and Iker Casillas fell out when the Portuguese manager was in charge.

But after Madrid signed Costa Rican keeper Keylor Navas this summer it became clear the 32-year-old Spaniard was surplus to requirements.

There had been some suggestions that Iker Casillas, Madrid's captain, would leave the club instead, but Lopez's transfer would put an end to that.

 Although details of the deal have not been revealed, it is thought Lopez will sign a four-year deal with the club.

AC Milan manager Pippo Inzaghi said of his incoming signing: 'Diego Lopez is very important,'

'He is an experienced goalkeeper and will improve our squad,'

Lopez will be Inzaghi's sixth summer signing after the Italians already brought in Jeremy Menez, Alex, Michael Agazzi, Michelangelo Albertazzi and Adil Rami.
