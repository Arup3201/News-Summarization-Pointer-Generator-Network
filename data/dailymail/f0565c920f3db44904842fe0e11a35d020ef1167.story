Compulsory: International development minister Lynne Featherstone (pictured) said tackling FGM should be a required part of the curriculum

Lessons on female genital mutilation should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum in areas where the practice is prevalent, a junior minister said.

Lynne Featherstone also stressed more support and training was needed for professionals dealing with the issue on the front line.

Speaking in the Commons, she said: 'When I went to Burkina Faso, one of the leading countries in Africa in reducing and tackling female genital mutilation, I visited a school to watch an FGM lesson where it is part of the curriculum.

'I do believe it needs to be a required part of the curriculum here in high prevalence areas.

'The Deputy Prime Minister (Nick Clegg) in a recent speech on development made a commitment linked to this and also support to frontline professionals, because we know from the NSPCC helpline that professionals need support and training.

'FGM is violence against women and girls and the UK has made the largest donor commitment ever to end FGM with a flagship programme of £35 million in at least 17 countries.

'The Prime Minister (David Cameron) will host a summit in July that will step up global efforts to end both FGM and child early enforced marriage within a generation.'

The international development minister was responding to a question from Cambridge MP Dr Julian Huppert, who asked: 'Do you agree with many of the people who have given evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee that we should ensure all children in the UK are taught about FGM and the fact it is not allowed?

'And that we should not allow parents to take their children out because the children whose parents would not want them to know would be the children we need to target?'

Ms Featherstone said he had raised a 'critical issue'.

She was then asked by Angela Watkinson whether she agreed the problem was part of a wider issue of gender inequality.

The MP for Hornchurch and Upminster asked: 'Would you agree FGM is part of a much wider issue of cultures where gender equality is not recognised and will you take every opportunity possible when contacting countries where this applies to further the cause?'

The minister replied: 'I can assure you I do take every opportunity to raise the issue.

'These social norms which oppress and suppress women - and have been going for 4,000 years - are really because of women’s low status in the world in terms of rights, in terms of voice, choice and control over their own lives.'
