Losing a camera on holiday is bad enough – but at least it can be replaced.

What is more distressing for most of us is the loss of all the precious images it contains.

Holidaymakers Mary Stallard and Andrew Sully certainly thought they would never again see the 100 or so pictures on their digital camera when it sank in a French river.

Minutes before disaster struck: The couple's daughters Joanna, 15, front left, and Cerys, 12, back right, canoeing down the Dordogne before their camera was lost in the river

Happy memories: One of the last family pictures taken before they lost their camera in the river Dordogne

But the husband and wife, both vicars,
had reckoned without the intervention of scuba diver Kevin Quirin who 
chanced upon the device in the murky depths of the river a fortnight 
later.

The Frenchman not only recovered the 
£100 camera from the bed of the Dordogne River but, in a remarkable 
piece of detective work, used clues in the pictures on the undamaged 
memory card to reunite them with their owners.

Super sleuth: Kevin Quirin who managed to track the couple down by viewing the pictures on their lost camera memory card

Mr Quirin, 23, a maths student, managed to track down the couple after downloading and studying their photos.

He deduced 44-year-old Mr Sully’s surname after finding two pictures of him next to signs bearing the word ‘Sully’.

He also found pictures of him at the end of a London to Paris charity bike ride last July.

Mr Quirin, from Rennes, Brittany, 
searched the event on the charity donation website JustGiving and found 
the name of Andrew Sully, with contact details.

He emailed the family: ‘I think I’ve found your camera’, and then forwarded the 100 holiday photos.

The vicars, from Llangollen near 
Wrexham, North Wales, lost their camera when the canoe they were 
paddling down the river with children Joanna, 15, and Cerys, 12, 
capsized.

Mrs Stallard, 45, a school chaplain, 
said: ‘Not only did Kevin find our camera but then he managed to track 
us down. What he did was quite amazing. We are delighted we have got our
photographs back.’

After Mr Sully completed his charity 
bike ride in Paris, the family travelled south to the Dordogne but 
during a leisurely afternoon on the river, their hired canoe rolled over
after hitting a bridge at Pinsac.

The first clue: Kevin surmised that Andrew's surname was Sully after viewing this picture of him and his two daughters next to Pont Sully in Paris

Second clue: And if Kevin had any doubts, this second picture of Andrew at the Sully wing of the Louvre in Paris proved he was on the right track

Third clue: After seeing this picture of Andrew's charity bike ride to Paris, Kevin checked the justgiving website for the surname Sully and found his donation page, providing the final link needed for him to contact the vicar

Andrew and Mary Sully, pictured with their daughters Joanna and Cerys in Paris, thought they would never see their holiday photos again

Mrs Stallard said: ‘Andrew dived down 
to see if he could retrieve the camera but he couldn’t see anything 
because the water was  murky. There was also a strong current so he gave
up quite quickly.

‘We returned home after a few days and
then, out of the blue, we received an email a couple of weeks later 
from a guy in France saying he had found our camera.’

Mr Quirin had been enjoying a barge 
holiday with friends when they decided to go scuba diving in the river.

Two of the images that helped him identify the camera’s owners were 
snaps of Mr Sully posing in the Sully wing of the Louvre gallery and on 
the Pont de Sully over the River Seine in Paris.

Mr Quirin said: ‘I was scuba diving when I saw this shiny thing and grabbed it.

‘The camera didn’t work but the card was OK and after I dried it out I put it into my PC.’
