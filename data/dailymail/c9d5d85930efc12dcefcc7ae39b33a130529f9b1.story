This is the incredible moment a crowd lifts a tram off a schoolgirl’s leg after she was crushed and trapped in Dublin.

The camera phone footage shows commuters working together to push the tram off the young girl who can be heard crying and screaming in pain.

Łukasz Piguła filmed the incident which happened around 9am this morning at the Jervis Street shopping centre stop in Dublin city centre.

The schoolgirl suffered minor injuries and was taken to the Mater Hospital as a precautionary measure.

More than 30 quick-thinking passengers and staff came to help the young girl who became wedged in the gap when trying to leave the tram.

She can be seen recovering on the platform after her leg was freed.

There have been a number of accidents on the Luas, the twin-lined light railway system that connects east and south Dublin with the city centre.

Four people have died in separate incidents and many others have been injured, according to the Belfast Telegraph.

A spokesperson for Luas described the incident this morning as 'minor' and said that normal services have resumed.

This comes weeks after railway passengers and staff freed a man who had become trapped between a train and the platform by rocking the carriage.

The man was boarding a rush hour train at Stirling station, 9km northwest of Perth, Western Australia, at 8.50am on August 6 when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap.

His leg was saved when those on the platform tilted the 90-tonne of train, by collectively rocking the carriage.
