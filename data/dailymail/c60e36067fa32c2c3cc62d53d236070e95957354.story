Rik Mayall's children gathered today for the unveiling of a bench in their actor father's name similar to the one he sat on while starring in the hit sitcom Bottom.

Bonnie, Sidney and Rosie Mayall joined fans of the BBC Two comedy near Hammersmith Bridge Road in Hammersmith, west London, where part of the show's opening credits were filmed.  

Mr Mayall, who died in June, co-wrote and starred in the programme among other hit comedies between 1991 and 1995. 

Fans gathered outside Hammersmith Broadway in west London where a bench in the actor's memory has been unveiled following a public petition which gathered 7,000 signatures

The show's opening credits saw Mr Mayall and co-star Adrian Edmonson, who played Edward 'Eddie' Elizabeth Hitlersitting, sitting on the bench, bickering and fighting as streams of people walk past.

In 2010, the 56-year-old said spoke of his sadness that the bench, which sat on a traffic island at the bottom of King Street, had been replaced with a pelican crossing.

Following his death in June thousands of fans signed an online petition asking for it to be reinstated, or for a similar one to be built in his memory. 

Today a new bench was unveiled at the junction of Queen Caroline Street and Hammersmith Bridge Road. 

It bears a plaque reading: 'In Memory of The Man, The Myth, The Legend.

'Dr The Rik Mayal. Pan Global Phenomenon. Equality, Opportunity, Wisdom, Freedom & Love.

'Barbara: Love Is The Answer,' in reference to his beloved wife, Barbara Robbin. 

Friends, fans and co-stars of the actor gathered at the site today for its official unveiling where his children watched fondly chatted with crowds. 

Following their father's death in June, the siblings issued a heartfelt statement on social media, paying tribute to their 'wonderful, foul-mouthed father'.  

An online petition gathered 7,000 signatures calling on Hammersmith and Fulham Council to rebuild a bench in Mr Mayall's memory following his sudden death in June

The scene was made famous in the programme's opening credits. Bottom ran on BBC Two for four years

Nigel Planer, who starred alongisde Mr Myall in The Young Ones, delivered a reading, while crowds sang the programme's theme tunes.

The petition, which gathered more than 7,000 signatures,urged the council: 'Rik changed the face of comedy in the UK, he had a huge impact on thousands of people throughout the UK and around the globe. 

'We, the fans and friends, feel that we need a place where we can remember him and placing a memorial bench at this location is something we feel he would have loved.' 

Hammersmith and Fulham councillor Wesley Harcourt said the council was "proud of Rik Mayall's links to our borough".

He said: 'Bottom was set here, with the opening credits filmed on a bench in Hammersmith Broadway.

'That bench was later moved, so it seems right to put a new bench near the spot in memory of a great comic actor.'

Mayall shot to fame for his role in the hit comedy The Young Ones in which he played a pretentious, poetry-writing student (far right)

In 2010, Mr Mayall was asked in a BBC interview what the worst journey he had ever made across London was. 

'Hammersmith is my stomping ground I suppose. And one of the great opening credit sequences was for the telly show Bottom, where you had Richie and Eddie - me and Ade - sitting on a bench,' he said. 

'If you were to come to the end of King Street where it meets the big roundabout to get to the Hammersmith Apollo, you'd find that same bench on a traffic island - until one day they took it away and put a pelican crossing in its place.

'That for me is the worst journey I ever made, discovering what had happened to that bench.'

Earlier this year the actor's former co-star Adrian Edmonson said he was struggling to cope with his friend's death. 

Mr Mayall died of an 'acute cardiac arrest' after a morning run with his wife, Barbara, it was reported. 

Rik Mayall shot to fame as the obnoxious, poetry-writing anarchist Rick in The Young Ones alongside his friend Adrian Edmondson before the duo later went on to star in their sitcom Bottom.

The pair – known as The Dangerous Brothers because of their propensity for hitting each other over the head – found fame after meeting at Manchester University.

Considered one of Britain's comedy greats, Mayall memorably played conniving Conservative politician Alan B'stard in the sitcom The New Statesman and swashbuckling Lord Flashheart in Blackadder.

He and Edmondson also created and starred 'Bottom,' a surreally violent slapstick series about two unemployed slobs

He also featured on the big screen 1991 fantasy Drop Dead Fred - which gained him a U.S. cult following - and 1999 British comedy Guest House Paradiso. 

In 1998 the actor had a serious accident on a motorbike the day before Good Friday, which left him with a fractured skull and bleeding In his brain. 

In a Daily Mail interview years later, he joked: 'As I was technically dead for five days, I beat our Lord Jesus 5-3.' 

Following his death this year comedy giants and friends paid tribute to the 'extraordinary' actor he was. 

His children issued a heartfelt statement to their father, describing him as a 'wonderful, generous, foul-mouthed and hysterical father'.
