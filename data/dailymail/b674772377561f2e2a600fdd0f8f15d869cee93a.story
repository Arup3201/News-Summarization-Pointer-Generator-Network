Real Madrid's debts have grown to almost £500m according to the latest financial figures. 

The club's total debts had grown to £474m at the end of the 2014 financial year, with one financial expert describing the financial situation as 'very bad'. 

Spanish paper AS reported that the debts have risen from £426 at the end of the previous 12 months.

In debt Real Madrid have splashed the cash on world class stars like James Rodriguez 

Toni Kross is another big name to head to the Bernabeu 

Real recouped some money by flogging Angel di Maria to Manchester United for £60m 

Real boss Carlo Ancelotti splashed the cash this summer on Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez, Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos and Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas although they did recoup £60m by selling Angel di Maria to Manchester United. 

And the Spanish giants now own three of the four most expensive players in the world - Rodriguez, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Placido Rodriguez, head of the Observatory for Sports Economics, said: 'The financial situation of Madrid is very bad. 

'The debt is fairly high. To grow, Madrid may change to being a limited company.'
