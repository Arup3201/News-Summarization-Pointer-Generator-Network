It is a view of the Diamond Jubilee concert that you couldn’t see on television.

Photos and comments posted on Twitter by those involved in the celebrations give a unique insight into how the events unfolded behind the scenes.

Posting a picture of herself standing next to the Queen, pop singer Cheryl Cole wrote: ‘This image will live with me Forever.. I could never have dreamed of this moment.’

One of the more amusing Twitter 
exchanges began when Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen’s 
granddaughter Zara Phillips, posted a picture of Buckingham Palace he 
took on his phone from the royal box at the concert.

His image of the beautifully illuminated palace, posted with the caption ‘BP looking good’, seemed innocent enough.

But his England Rugby teammates were 
less reserved, with one, Andy Goode, writing: ‘Which one is yours and 
z’s bedroom window tonight big lad??!!’

Another friend, seeing that Tindall 
was seated just in front of David Cameron, replied: ‘U be careful with 
that PM guy behind u, reading all ur tweets & texts and being all 
judgemental!!’

Winger Mark Cueto added: ‘Your pearly whites looking good
 on my tele kid? Must be the HD??’ 

American
 pop star Will.i.am, who performed at the concert, had clearly been 
enjoying his day at the palace.

He tweeted a picture of himself with the
 royal guards, with the caption: ‘Me and my crew holding down the royal 
palace while the people celebrate the #diamondjubilee.’

He then posted a picture of himself wearing one of the guards’ bearskin hats.

Stephen Fry, watching the concert from his London home, posted an audio recording of the fireworks, writing that they were ‘rattling his windows’.

He was obviously more impressed with the BBC’s TV coverage than he had been on Sunday, when he called it ‘mind-numbingly tedious’.

He tweeted: ‘You see BBC? It works so much better with no commentary.’

While the Royal Family, politicians and celebrities enjoyed the concert, Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow was absent from the celebrations.

And despite being an ardent anti-monarchist, she took to Twitter to complain that she hadn’t had a VIP invitation. ‘I wish,’ she told one user who asked if she had been invited.

‘We get the stuffy, pompous perks mainly’ – referring to the fact that she and her husband had been invited to join the thanksgiving service yesterday at St Paul’s Cathedral.

Later, she said she had reluctantly 
agreed to attend because ‘if I hadn’t accompanied Mr B, they’d bang on 
about what a disgraceful, unsupportive wife I am’.

In
 response to her comments, one exasperated Twitter user wrote: ‘Why 
don’t you just shove off and let someone who would appreciate it be 
speakers wife then?’

Mrs
 Bercow had already annoyed fellow Twitter users with her comments about
 the jubilee, after calling members of the public who had joined the 
celebrations ‘mindless, flag-waving loons’.

She told followers she was 
‘underwhelmed’ by the jubilee celebrations – while boasting that she had
 ‘the best view in London’ of them.

She
 also tweeted that she was ‘c**p at pretending to be ardent monarchist’ 
and that the best thing about the jubilee was the ‘retailer discounts.’

The
 Duchess of York wistfully tweeted about the jubilee, which she watched 
on TV after not being invited to any of the official celebrations. 
Sarah, 52, wrote: ‘Sooo proud of my girls smiling broadly, celebrating 
Granny with the Nation and Eugie with her flag and both happy smiles.’ 

Minutes
 later, she added: ‘Prince Andrew, The Duke of York looking very dashing
 in his naval uniform.

'Would love to see more of my girls and their Papa
 on the BBC.’

And when
 journalist Matthew D’Ancona tweeted that she should have been included 
in the celebrations, she was quick to agree.

He wrote: ‘If Robbie and 
Gary can make up, surely it’s time to forgive Fergie? Mother of two the 
Queen’s grandchildren, after all.’

In reply, she wrote: ‘Friendship and support is honey to the soul.

'We need more kindness and forgiveness in this world.'
