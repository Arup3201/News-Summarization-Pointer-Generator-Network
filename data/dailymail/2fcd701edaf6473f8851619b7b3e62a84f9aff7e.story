A furious mother has slammed the NHS after her 'fit and active' 11-year-old son was sent home from school with a letter branding him overweight.

Coralyn Hobbs, 35, was stunned when her son William Barnes-Hobbs arrived home from Ely St Mary's Junior School in Cambridgeshire with a letter advising he needed to make 'lifestyle changes' to get to a normal weight.

It came after William and his his classmates were measured at their school as part of the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP).

Ms Hobbs said her son was an 'extremely fit and active boy', and said categorising children as overweight or obese is 'disgraceful'

Health staff recorded the weight and height of each pupil before the sending the findings to parents to tell them what category they fall in to.

Ms Hobbs was then informed that William, who is 4ft 9in tall and weighed six-and-a-half stone, was in the overweight category, according to NHS scales. 

She describes the results as 'disgraceful' and would cause some children to develop an eating disorder.

'I feel hurt for him and all the other children who are labelled overweight or obese,' said the mother-of-two.

'The sad thing is that these days, unless you're stick thin, you're automatically classed as overweight.

'It's not fair and certainly not good to be encouraging children to think like that when all you hear is that eating disorders are on the rise.

'I think it's disgraceful that children are being categorised in this way. William isn't overweight. I'd say he's perfectly proportioned actually.

'Yet just because of his height and weight he's labelled overweight. It's wrong.'

The NCMP measures children in Reception class and Year 6 and takes into consideration their age, height and sex.

Children are then given a letter to take home, telling their parents or carers what category they fall into, and what lifestyle changes they could make, should they wish to. 

If William weighed just 3lbs less or was one inch taller than he would have been classified as 'healthy' but Ms Hobbs says he already fits into this category.

'He eats healthily, including his five fruit and veg a day,' said Ms Hobbs, who also lives with her partner Ian Barnes and their daughter Kayleigh-Jane.

'He also eats a lot of homegrown things, including home-reared meats.

'He's an extremely fit and active boy. He plays a lot of sport, bikes everyday, goes fishing everyday and is generally always outdoors.'

Mandy Mayes, lead nurse for the NCMP in Cambridgeshire, said she recognised the programme can be a 'sensitive topic'.

She said: 'We would like to reassure parents that, along with trusts across the country, the NCMP team uses a nationally accredited NHS measure to establish a child's weight status, taking into consideration their age, height and sex.

'This information is then shared with parents or carers who are offered further support to make any lifestyle changes they may wish, which is entirely voluntary.

'We do recognise this can be a sensitive topic and would encourage parents to contact us if they wish to discuss any aspect of their child's health.' 

A spokesman for Ely St Mary's Junior School said the programme was part of a national scheme.

She said: 'This is a national screening programme which all schools are involved in.'

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said the NCMP was designed to be used for statistical use, and should not be used to inform children that they are overweight.

'It's not a precise measurement,' he told MailOnline.

The Body Mass Index is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying.

Medics use a modified BMI scale with children that takes account of their age and sex.

One in three children in Britain is classed as 'overweight' according to official government figures. 

Children are classed as either underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight.

According the National Childhood Measurement Programme: 'It can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age. That’s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure.'Research shows that if your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems in later life, so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing.'

'There are many children who have their parents informed by letter that they are overweight and the parents are furious because the child is of build that is not overweight for their stature.

'The letters sent out are a combination of a mail merge between computer data, and there needs to be the intervention of a school nurse - who as a human being is far better equipped to decide if a child is overweight.

'When the parent has the letter they can decide how valid it is and if it is valid the parent needs to be careful how he or she transmits the information to the child.

'It is quite possible that the child could be given the wrong message.

'Children of 11 should never go on diets, they need all the nutrition they can get and being told they are overweight could have tragic consequences. 

'I hope parents will provide their children with sensible advice and make sure the child does not dwell on the letter, but gets all the good things like the right food and exercise.

'I would think in this case the parent would be furious and this is the danger of the child measurement programme - it was never designed to be a clinical programme, but was intended as a statistical tool.'
