The lack of Diego Costa handed Dominic Solanke the opportunity to make the bench for the first time in his Chelsea career. But what do we know about the 17-year-old? Sportsmail takes a look.

Who is he?

Solanke is one in a crop of bright youngsters coming through the ranks at Stamford Bridge and ought to make some sort of impact on the first team sooner rather than later.

A pacey striker, his goals fired the Blues to an FA Youth Cup trophy last season and scored consecutive hat-tricks in the competition. Solanke actually only turned 17 a month ago but has already played for the club’s Under 21s and in the UEFA Youth League.

What’s he done before?

He has been at the club since 2004 and Chelsea have paid close attention to his development, which has increased rapidly over the past year. He scored 18 goals while leading the line for the academy side last year and his sharpness in front of goal means Mourinho has no qualms in throwing the teenager into the first team squad.

Why do I recognise his name?

This might be why. ‘My conscience tells me that if, for example, [Lewis] Baker, [Izzy] Brown, and Solanke are not national team players in a few years, I should blame myself,’ said Mourinho in the summer.

A real ringing endorsement, but with it comes a touch of added pressure.

He has recently signed a three-year deal with the league leaders. Serious faith in his ability.

Jose Mourinho said that if Solanke was not a senior England player in a few years he would blame himself

Is he English?

Very much so. Solanke scored the winner for England’s Under 18s against Holland last month and - should he start playing games in the cup for Chelsea or go out on loan - can’t be far away from Gareth Southgate’s Under 21s.

A word of warning, though. Solanke is eligible to play for Nigeria - his dad’s country of birth.

Is he more a Drogba or Remy?

Certainly more in the mould of Loic Remy in that he’s quick over five yards and can leave defenders for dead given the chance to run at them. But he is well-built for his age and appears to have the muscle needed to make a fist of senior football sooner rather than later.

But who is Solanke, and why does Jose Mourinho rate him so highly?
