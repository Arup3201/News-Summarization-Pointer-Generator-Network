His videos show acts of gravity-defying strength so it's no surprise that Simon Ata has garnered over 14,000 fans on his Facebook page, where he exhibits eye-popping manoeuvres such as vertically bouncing on one hand.

The 24-year-old works as a breakdancing teacher in Melbourne, which is where he became inspired to pursue his impressive mode of bodyweight training.

When asked to define his style of training, Simon said it was an amalgamation of different approaches, including gymnastics, breakdancing and calisthenics 

‘I started to become passionate about strength and balance moves about six years ago’ he said. 

‘Breakdancing helped me work out which moves the public appreciate and influenced what I focused on in training.’

When asked to define his style of training, Simon said it was an amalgamation of approaches.

‘I'd probably call it bodyweight strength training, but it's a combination of gymnastics, breakdancing and calisthenics.’

‘I eat whatever I want and don’t follow any diet routine. My training consists of flips and power moves about three times a week, with some extra bodyweight training. I don't really train with weights.’

Simon said there are a number of advantages to what he does over conventional weight training.

‘You can do it anywhere. You don't rely on anyone else, it's just you and the floor. I’ve also never had any injuries from this, since you can control the pace and difficulty very well.’ 

Simon says the advantage of bodyweight training is that you can do it anywhere and you rarely suffer injuries

Simon recommends anyone hoping to learn his impressive style of training get started by watching some YouTube tutorials.

‘After that, you can look at joining a local gymnastics club for a more formal approach. Any open gymnastics' sessions are a great place to start,’ he said.

‘From my experience, people who train at these sessions are friendly and happy to lend a helping hand to beginners.’
