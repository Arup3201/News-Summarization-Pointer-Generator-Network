Accused: Amal El-Wahabi, 27, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, was told to put her 'trust in Allah' as she pawned her wedding ring for nappies and milk

A terrorist's wife who allegedly paid a student to smuggle money into Syria pawned her wedding ring to buy nappies while her husband sent pictures of him holding AK47s, the Old Bailey was told today.

Amal El-Wahabi, 27, told her husband Aine Davis that she was starving and struggling to provide for her children while he was fighting in the Middle East.

But Davis, 30, continued in his bid to get his wife to join him by sending her an ISIS propaganda video via WhatsApp.

The court heard he sent the clip, which encourages people to 'pick up arms to jihad', followed shortly by the message: ‘Good innit?’.

El-Wahabi, a mother-of-two, is accused of arranging for her friend Nawal Msaad, 27, to hide 20,000 euros in her knickers and take it to Davis.

Msaad was detained by counter-terrorism police at Heathrow Airport in January after they discovered the hidden package in her underwear.

In a series of messages between El-Wahabi and her husband Davis, she was told to put her 'trust in Allah', despite complaining that her children were suffering. 

She said: ‘Your boys are ill, it’s hard dealing with them on my own. I’m tired.’

In an earlier exchange, she described how her mother was begging her not to travel to Syria.

But she said: ‘After speaking to you last night kind of changed me, I know you need me there.

‘I do wish I was different and I didn’t have to be confused. I do love you and you are my husband.’

El-Wahabi eventually decided to join her husband and got Msaad to conceal the cash in  before travelling to Syria.

The court was told Davis sent the incendiary three-minute video while they were arranging the exchange.

It featured armed men holding a black flag with the slogan ‘There’s no God like Allah’.

The video states: ‘How enjoyable that the guardian of death hugs me and entertains me when I hold my machine gun with the palm of my hand.’

Viewers are told to ‘go ahead and pick up arms to the jihad’ and it carries the name of the terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.'  

Asked the following day if she had watched it, El-Wahabi replied: ‘Yeah I did, I see how it is.’

Davis had left London a few months earlier to join the jihadist cause in Syria but remained in contact with his wife and their two sons.

He told his wife not to let the boys have baseball hats because they were worn by the ‘kaffir.’

El-Wahabi, who calls her terrorist husband ‘Honey bunny,’ tells him in one message ‘the kids are going through a hard time. My faith is so low. It’s too much. We are in a lot of debt.’

She complains that the baby buggy is broken and she cannot afford a new one, but Davis is adamant there is no chance of him returning.

‘How could you think I could come back,’ he asks. ‘Its a test. Be patient. Put your trust in Allah.’

Davis tells her she could go to be with him in Syria. But El-Wahabi replies: ‘You need to watch the news. They are on to people. I don’t think you know how bad it is.’

She adds: ‘I don’t think you understand. Even if I wanted to come I cannot as they are on to people.

In another message she states: ‘I don’t know how to deal with this long distance marriage and being broke. I don’t know how long I can be patient. Don’t be angry but I sold my ring.. I needed the money.’

Davis tells her: ‘Forget the news. Allah sees it all.' His wife continues to tell him why she pawned the ring.

‘I needed nappies and food. You don’t know how bad it is. It’s worse than ever. I had no choice. My kids need food and milk.’

Smuggled: Nawal Msaad, also 27, is accused of concealing €20,000 in her knickers to give to El-Wahabi's husband Aine Davis in Syria. She was stopped by counter terrorism police at Heathrow Airport in January

At one point Davis answers: ‘I have no time for this. I am preparing myself for Allah.’

El-Wahabi says: 'I don’t know how I got myself into this, two kids and broke and husband aint around. There is not enough food for the three of us so I don’t eat that much.’

She adds: ‘No matter what I am going through you will not come and help me.. That breaks my heart.’

Davis says: ‘I am never coming back. Get that out of your head.’

But his wife tells him he will not necessarily be caught if he returns: 'You might not go to jail because lots of people are coming back. If you go to jail it is in Allah’s hands.’

Davis sends her a picture of him with a heavily armed comrade and adds: ‘I am good and you think I would come back for humiliation?’

He also mailed her a jihadi video and tells his wife: ‘I have chosen this path. I hope this makes things clear.’

El-Wahabi recruited Msaad to smuggle to the cash to Turkey as there are no direct flights to Syria. 

She was taken to a private room where she pulled out a roll of banknotes from inside her underwear.

Davis, who had previously lived in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen and Egypt, flew to Amsterdam in July 2013 and has not returned to the UK. He is thought to either be dead or still in Syria.

Msaad and El-Wahab both deny becoming concerned in a funding arrangement as a result of which money was made available or was to be made available to another, and they knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism.

The trial continues.
