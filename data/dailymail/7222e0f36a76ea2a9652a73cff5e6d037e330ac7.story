A former Melrose Place actress charged in a fatal auto accident two years ago was being chased by another driver causing her reckless behaviour, her attorney told jurors on the first day of her manslaughter trial on Thursday.

A prosecutor countered that Amy Locane-Bovenizer, 40, who played Sandy in the original 1990s TV series, was intoxicated causing the crash that killed Helene Seeman and critically injured her husband, Fred.

Attorney Blair Zwillman told a Somerville jury that Locane-Bovenizer was chased four miles by a woman whose car she had rear-ended minutes before, The Star-Ledger reported.

Victims: Helene Zucker Seeman was killed when her car was hit by Locane-Bovenizer's vehicle while also critically injuring her husband, pictured beside her

He said the woman, identified in court as Maureen Ruckelshaus, honked her horn and flashed her lights, causing Locane-Bovenizer to drive nearly 20 mph over the speed limit on narrow country roads.

'Why is she pursuing someone with the most horrendous of distractions possible?' Mr Zwillman asked jurors. 'She began to act as a police officer, which she had no right to do.'

The chase ended when the actress slammed into the Seemans' vehicle as it pulled into a driveway.

In his opening statement, Somerset County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy said Locane-Bovenizer had eight to 10 drinks at two gatherings before the accident and had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit.

'Death was probable, not merely possible,' Mr Murphy told jurors. 'These circumstances were so extreme that death was probable.'

Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two, is charged with aggravated manslaughter and assault by auto and faces up to 30 years in prison if she is convicted.

Locane-Bovenizer appeared on 13 episodes of 'Melrose Place' in 1992 in the role of Sandy Louise Harling. She also appeared in numerous movies including 'Cry-Baby' that also stared Johnny Depp, 'School Ties' and 'Secretary.'

During court hearings last summer, a police testified that the actress was found ‘giggling’ and appearing ‘happy’ as she sat in a drainage ditch following the collision in June of 2010.

A short time later, the actress asked the officer and emergency medical personnel why they were 'making such a big deal' about applying a neck brace and putting her in an ambulance, Montgomery police officer William Wilkes told the court.

'She said we were being overly dramatic,' said Officer  Wilkes. 'I said, "The reason I’m making such a big deal is because you were just in a severe two-car collision."'

'After they had taken a blood sample, at some point she said, "Am I pregnant or am I just drunk?"' Officer Wilkes told the court.

He also recalled that, in the hours following the crash, Locane-Bovenizer urinated in her hospital bed, rambled incoherently and at times seemed unaware of what had just occurred.

Officer Wilkes was the second officer to arrive at the crash scene after the emergency call was made at 9.16pm where he found Locane-Bovenizer sitting upright in the nearby ditch.

'Her clothes were a little messed up, dirty,' he recalled to the court. 'Her eyes were bloodshot and watery, her speech was a little slurred.'

He added that the actress was 'happy giggling laughing' when he found her and alleged that during the ambulance ride she told emergency personnel that she had consumed four glasses of wine and a beer.

In the hospital emergency room, he told the court that Locane-Bovenizer asked several times what had happened to her sport utility vehicle.

When Officer Wilkes answered her, he said, 'She kind of acknowledged it and a couple minutes later it would be like that conversation never happened, almost.'

Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I’m sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer  Wilkes added.

The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer.

Despite the seriousness of the incident, her attorney previously  told website TMZ  that he was 'surprised' at the aggravated manslaughter charge.

'I don't believe it is supported by the law or the facts and I think it constitutes over-reaching by the prosecutor's office,' said Mr Zwillman.
