A high school wrestler claimed an Oregon state title on Saturday night as his grandfather suffered a fatal heart attack in the stands.

Dallas High School senior Matt Hofenbredl was halfway through the third round of his winning match at the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum in Portland when his grandfather, Larry Hofenbredl, collapsed. 

Unaware of the situation, Matt defeated his opponent and jumped into his coach's arms before his mother walked on to the mat and told him what had happened, the Statesman-Journal reported.

He then ran to stands where Assistant Coach Josh Christenson, who also works as a firefighter, was performing CPR on the 70-year-old, The Oregonian reported.

The tournament stopped for around 10 minutes as medics rushed to Mr Hofenbredl's side and took him to hospital, where he passed away.
