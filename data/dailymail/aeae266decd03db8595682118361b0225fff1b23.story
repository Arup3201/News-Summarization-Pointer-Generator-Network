A mother who went out curtain shopping instead of taking her injured baby to hospital has been warned by a judge that she may be given community service to help improver her parenting skills.

Nicky Thompson and her boyfriend Beau Degeorge had noticed swelling on her six-month-old daughter's head but waited two days before taking her to get treatment.

When doctors eventually saw the child they found severe ‘boggy’ swelling on the right side
of the baby’s head caused by a skull fracture and on the left side a 
complex fracture had caused further swelling.

Nicky Thompson had noticed swelling on her six-month-old daughter's head, but it was two days before her boyfriend took the child to Homerton Hospital in east London, where doctors found the baby had fractured her skull

A court was told that 30-year-old Degeorge could not be bothered to take 
the baby to the hospital when the injuries were first discovered on 
September 30, 2011 because he would have had to tale two buses to get there.

He told police he lied to 21-year-old 
Thompson about taking the girl to a walk-in centre to ‘avoid an 
argument’, Snaresbrook Crown Court had heard.

Thompson, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, then went curtain shopping with her mother the following day while the baby’s condition deteriorated.

The pair were both found guilty of a single charge of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 by a jury of five men and six women, and were ordered to return to court for sentencing in January.

It was not until October 2, when the baby’s eyes were vacant and she had not been her usual playful seld, that Degeorge finally took her to Homerton Hospital in east London to be treated.

‘They neglected their child’, said prosecutor Emma Smith.

‘It would appear that despite seeing the swelling, they thought the baby did not need medical attention.

‘Thompson says that on seeing the swelling she thought the baby did need medical attention but rather than taking her herself, she told Degeorge to go - but he didn’t.

‘The child wasn’t getting any better, but rather than taking her to the doctor, Thompson chose to go shopping for curtains with her mother.’

When the baby was finally taken to hospital and seen at 5.50pm on Sunday, October 2, Degeorge and Thompson spun a web of lies, blaming the delay on each another.

'Degeorge told the doctor that they noticed the swelling above the right ear on the Friday’, said Ms Smith.

‘The doctor noted the swelling and the baby cried when she touched her on the head - another doctor found a 10cm boggy swelling on the child’s head.

‘Degeorge told the doctor she had not been her normal self and was not smiling or playful - he said he did not know any reason why the swelling might have occurred.

‘When asked about the mother, he said that she felt he was making a big deal out of nothing.’

The court was told that Degeorge, of Hackney, East London, received a string of calls from Thompson while at the hospital, but he told the doctor she had locked herself out of the house and needed the keys.

Thompson eventually arrived at the hospital and told doctors she had taken the baby to Royal London Hospital on Friday, claiming she was told the tot had probably hit her head on something.

‘On Monday, October 3, the baby was seen by a paediatrician and when asked, Thompson said she had noticed the swelling on the Thursday and that the father had taken the child to a walk-in centre the next day,’ Ms Smith continued.

‘There had been no visit to a walk-in centre - the father had lied and told the mother he had in order to avoid an argument.

Judge Judith Hughes QC, sitting at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, said she needed to consider if there was a form of community service that Thompson could carry out to help with her parenting skills

‘It really comes down to this - why didn’t both parents take her to the hospital on that Friday when they say they first noticed the swelling?

‘Fortunately there was no obvious brain damage sustained by this child.’

The pair were arrested a week later and interviewed by police but both gave differing accounts on what had happened that weekend.

Degeorge told police Thompson had told him to call NHS Direct, but after she refused to make the call, he decided not to call out of principle.

He said he didn’t take the baby to hospital on that Friday because he would have to get two buses, and told Thompson he had when in fact he had gone to his mother’s house.

Thompson told police Degeorge had said the baby would be OK and that he would then take her to the hospital.

She said she had wanted to take her to hospital but Degeorge had left too quickly and told her he was taking the baby to the hospital when he in fact hadn’t.

She had no explanation as to why she went shopping.

The girl suffered no lasting damage from the incident.

Judge Judith Hughes QC said: ‘I think in Ms Thompson’s case a report is essential - I need to consider whether there is some form of community punishment that might assist her with such things as parenting skills.

‘For parity, I will have a report on Mr Degeorge as well but I make it clear that currently, all options are open at this stage for both defendants.’

Degeorge was remanded in custody while Thompson was released on bail ahead of sentence on January 6 next year.
