A Costa coffee customer was left horrified after she found a worker's blood mixed in with her latte.

Janine Hughes bought the hot drink from the chain's drive-through store in Swansea, South Wales and thought it tasted strange.

The 30-year-old was sickened when she opened the lid and found fresh blood staining the inside of her cup and mixed with the coffee.

Today she told how she drove back to the outlet and discovered the source of the blood was a barista who had cut his hand while making drinks

Janine Hughes has complained after her discovering blood mixed in with her latte from Costa coffee

The 30-year-old IT worker had bought the drink atÂ the chain's 'drive thru' store in Swansea, South Wales, but removed the lid to find blood on the inside of the cup

She is now nervously awaiting blood test results to check she did not catch anything from the contaminated coffee.

Ms Hughes complained to the manager, who gave her a new latte, and later received a letter from the area manager.

But she has yet to receive a response to an official complaint she made to the company's headquarters.

She said: 'I drove off and took two sips of my latte and it tasted like iron. I realised something was wrong, but did not know what at the time.

'Then I saw blood on the inside of the lid and realised there was blood in the coffee.

'I was filled with horror when I realised what I had just drunk. I drove back and asked to see the manager.'

She says the manager of the drive through coffee shop in Swansea, South Wales, told her that the employee who served her had a cut hand.

Ms Hughes received an apology from the area manager but is angry the company's HQ has not responded

She is now awaiting tests to check she did not catch anything  and has vowed never to visit the chain again

The barista had then gone to dress his wound while another staff member changed the lid, but the drink already had blood mingled in with the milk and coffee.

IT worker Ms Hughes added: 'The person who served me was mortified. But I should have been given a completely new coffee and not just a new lid.

'I was given a new latte in the end but I had to report it - it was too serious to ignore.'

Ms Hughes said she will never drink at the any of the chain's outlets again.

She added: 'Not once have they contacted me. They have hidden behind the brand. That is terrible.

'I have had the worry of the blood tests. I don't think I will ever go to Costa again. I will support my local coffee shops.'

A Costa Coffee spokesman said: 'Our area manager has spoken to Ms Hughes and apologised for the distress this obviously caused her.

'This was an isolated incident and does not reflect our high standards of safety and hygiene.'
