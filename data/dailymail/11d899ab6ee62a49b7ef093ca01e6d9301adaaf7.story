A wrong-way driver who smashed into a 26-year-old mother of two young boys, killing her, was nearly four times the legal driving limit at the time, according to police.

Stephen Martin, 39, told Arizona Department of Public Safety officials that he knew he was drunk and shouldn't have been driving at the time of the crash on Tuesday morning.

As he drove on Interstate 17 with a 38-year-old female passenger at 1am, he crashed into Megan Lange's car as the young mother headed home following a shift as a fire department dispatcher.

Lange, a married mother to two sons, six-month-old Miles and two-year-old Sean, had just returned to work at the Phoenix Fire Department following maternity leave.

Loss: Megan Lange, pictured with her husband Patrick and their sons, two-year-old Sean and six-month-old Miles, died after her car was hit by a drunk wrong-way driver as she drove home from work on Tuesday

She was rushed to hospital and clung to life for nearly 15 hours but was taken off life support just before 4pm on Tuesday, the Arizona Republic reported. 

Martin and his passenger both survived the crash with minor injuries. Another motorist whose car was sideswiped in the collision was also treated for minor injuries.

Martin had a blood-alcohol level of .313 at the time of the crash, DPS said, the Arizona Republic reported. The legal limit is .08.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found Martin lying behind his damaged SUV. He confirmed the vehicle was his, that he had been going the wrong way and that he had been drinking.

His female passenger said she had told him that they were going the wrong way but couldn't find a place to turn around on the interstate.

She estimated that they were driving 40 to 45 mph, according to court records. 

A Department of Public Safety officer said he noticed the white Chevrolet SUV driving southbound in the northbound lanes and outmaneuvered into a position to slow northbound traffic behind him, but Martin drove around him, sidewiped one car and then smashed into Lage's SUV, DPS said.

Happy: Mrs Lange had joined the fire department in 2009 and worked as a dispatcher. Colleagues remembered the young mother as a caring, professional worker and a proud mother to her two young sons

Lange was on her way home from her shift at the time, Captain Mark Vanacore, a Phoenix Fire Department spokesman, said.

'She was a professional,' said Jim Frazier, her supervisor and her husband's uncle. 'She not only delivered babies over the phone, she helped save many lives.' 

He added that she had been driven to join the department by a desire to help people. She joined the department in 2009, he said. 

'We are a tight family,' he said. 'We love each other deeply and we're going to come together and find meaning in this.'

Martin remains jailed on suspicion of second-degree murder and other crimes.

He appeared in court on Wednesday and his defense attorney Vicki Lopez said the case resulted from an 'unintentional act'.

Speaking to ABC15, Martin's father claimed that his son got behind the wheel when he was drunk because he was trying to help his former girlfriend - the female passenger - after she called him saying a man had raped her and was stalking her. 

Scene: Martin, who had a passenger, swerved around a Department of Public Safety officer who was trying to protect other cars from the approaching wrong-way driver and slammed into Mrs Lange's car

Wreck: Martin, who claims he was driving a woman to get away from a stalker, and his passenger escaped the crash with minor injuries. His wrecked vehicle is pictured on Interstate 17 following the crash

Martin picked the woman up and the alleged attacker started trailing them, his father said.

'He still doesn't know how it happened,' the unidentified man told ABC. 'He made a wrong turn, got on the freeway, because he was looking in the rear-view mirror. He was literally scared for his life.'

The man said he did not condone his son's decision to drive, but added: 'Hopefully the family will find it in their hearts at some point to forgive him and understand.'  

It was not the first time Martin had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, records show.

In 2006, he was arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana and pleaded guilty to possession or use of marijuana. He was sentenced to a year of probation.
