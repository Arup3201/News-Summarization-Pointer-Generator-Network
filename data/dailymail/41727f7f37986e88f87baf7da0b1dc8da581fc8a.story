The aging activists revealed to be behind a 1971 break-in at a Pennsylvania FBI office -
 shedding light on a controversial surveillance program - felt compelled
 to take part, they said.

John Raines, 80, and his wife, Bonnie, were
 part of an 
eight-member group of anti-Vietnam War protesters that broke into the 
offices in Media and left with 1,000 documents that revealed details of a
 domestic FBI spying operation known as Cointelpro.

'We did it... because somebody had to do 
it,' Mr Raines, a retired professor of religion at Temple 
University, told NBC News.

Revealed: John and Bonnie Raines have finally come forward after 43 years to admit they were two of the burglars who stole classified documents from the FBI offices in Pennsylvania in 1971

'In this case, by 
breaking a law - entering, removing files - we exposed a crime that 
was going on. When we are denied the information we need to have to 
act as citizens, then we have a right to do what we did.'

His
 wife added: 'I was horrified that our government was lying to us about 
what was actually happening in Vietnam. And all the usual things we 
always did - picketing, marching, signing petitions - didn't make any 
difference whatsoever.'

The
 case has similarities with that of Edward Snowden, who last year leaked
 details of the NSA's controversial surveillance programs. Mr Raines 
said he had a message for Snowden.

'From one whistelblower to another whistleblower - Hi!' he said, lifting his arm to wave.

The couple and a former Philadelphia cab driver, Keith Forsyth, identified themselves in new book 'The Burglary: The 
Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI' written by former Washington 
Post reporter Betty Medsger. Medsger was the first reporter to write a story about their findings.

Passionate: The couple, left, said they had to 
break-in the files because nothing else was working in their battled 
against the government. The FBI released this sketch of Bonnie after the
 break in

Satellite: The group targeted the FBI's smaller Media branch because they thought there was less risk involved

In the book, the group also details 
how they pulled it off and managed to stay anonymous when J. Edgar 
Hoover dispatched 200 agents to find the culprits.

The sting was organized by Haverford College physics professor Bill Davidon who has since died.

Instead
 of breaking into the FBI's main office, they decided to aim for the 
less-guarded Media office at a time when no one would notice: March 8, 
the night Muhammed Ali fought Joe Frazier.

In
 the weeks leading up to the break-in, the group cased the office in 
their hippie van and even sent in Bonnie Raines dressed as a college 
student to get details on the interior layout of the office.

'I tried to disguise my appearance as much as I could,' Mrs Raines told NBC News.  'I had long, dark, hippie hair at that time and I stuffed it up inside of a winter hat.'

She
 pretended to interview an FBI official about job prospects for women 
for the school paper, and never once took off her gloves the whole time 
so she wouldn't leave any finger prints.

Tricks: Bonnie, left, posed as a student to 
check out the inside of the office and helped break in on the night of 
the robbery. Her husband, John, right, stayed outside in a getaway car 
as they broke in

Political: John and Bonnie Raines said the change the break-in caused far outweighed breaking the law

On the night of the break-in the group only ran into one roadblock. They were forced to use another entrance to the office since the main door's lock couldn't be picked.

A back door ceded easily to a crow 
bar however and the group of eight tore through the office's cabinets 
looking for incriminating papers.

After
 the break-in at Media, Pennsylvania in 1941, the team left with more 
than 1,000 documents that they looked through and then filtered to the 
media.

Their central discovery was about COINTELPRO. Short for Counter Intelligence Program, it was originally J. Edgar Hoover's solution to break-up Communist groups.

It tracked the activity of domestic political groups it considered subversive. It aimed to discredit those in the group and destroy their public image.

It
 was later used in plans to bring down the Black Panthers, anti-Vietnam 
war movements and other civil rights groups.

A Senate group later determined that 
legal restrictions had been ignored in creating the program, and asked: 
'What happened to turn a law enforcement agency into a law violator?'

Hoover cancelled the 
program in 1972 after it was exposed by the break-in.

Mr Raines was waiting outside.

'I was sitting by myself in my station wagon and I was getting very very scared,' he said.

The
 team took as much as they could and fled to a nearby barn where they 
went through the information looking for anything of interest. 

Eventually
 they sent the documents to journalists who were able to contextualize 
the information and reveal one majorly controversial FBI operation 
called Cointelpro.

'These 
documents were explosive,' said Medsger, who received a batch of the 
files anonymously in the mail. 'The FBI was never the same.'

Short for Counter Intelligence Program, Cointelpro was originally J. Edgar Hoover's solution to break-up Communist groups.

The point of the program was to discredit those in the group and destroy their public image.

It
 was later used in plans to bring down the Black Panthers, anti-Vietnam 
war movements and other civil rights groups. Hoover cancelled the 
program in 1972 after it was exposed by the break-in.

'It looks like we're terribly reckless people,' Mr Raines, now 80, told the New York Times.
 'But there was absolutely no one in Washington - senators, congressmen,
 even the president - who dared hold J. Edgar Hoover to accountability. It became pretty obvious to us, that if we didn't do it nobody will.'

His wife added to NBC that their theft uncovered 'massive illegal surveillance and intimidation'.

Keith
 Forsyth, another burglar to come forward, said the only way to convince
 people of the FBI's operations was to 'get it in their handwriting'

Washington Post reporter

Comparisons: The couple said 'hi!' to fellow whistleblower Edward Snowden, who leaked details of an NSA surveillance program last year

After sending off the documents, the group never met together again and thus escaped being caught by the FBI.

Five
 of the eight have come forward in the book, and face no legal 
repercussions since they are outside the statue of limitations.

In the end, they believe the change the break-in caused far outweighed breaking the law - but not everyone agrees.

'I
 donâ€™t believe such people have the right to take it upon themselves and
 make decisions about what should be made public,' former FBI agent Pat 
Kelly told NBC.

'These are the same type of people that would look upon Snowden as perhaps a patriot when... in my opinion, he was a traitor.'
