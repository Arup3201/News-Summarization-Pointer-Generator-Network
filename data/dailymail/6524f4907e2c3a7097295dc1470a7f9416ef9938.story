Some photographers may sneer at people snapping away on their smartphones to preserve interesting sights and moments with friends for posterity.

But Apple’s new advertising campaign proves that the iPhone can take stunning photographs – when it's placed in talented hands.

Chosen images will feature on billboards around the world as well as on an online gallery to showcase the ability of the iPhone 6.

Apple’s new advertising campaign proves that the iPhone can take stunning photographs – when it's placed in talented hands. This is one of the photographs to feature in it, shot by Dan C in British Columbia, Canada. It shows the abstract patterns of bubbles trapped in a frozen lake, as well as moving water and the reflection of mountains

So far, those selected include amazing natural scenes such as frozen bubbles in a Canadian lake, fields of sunflowers in Thailand and shafts of light in a forest.

There are also man-made scenes such as impressive skylines, art installations, balancing fishermen and even a hot air balloon festival.

The advertising campaign will showcase snaps taken by 77 iPhone photographers using their latest handset, which made its debut last year.

The chosen images will feature on billboards around the world as well as on an online gallery to showcase the ability of the iPhone 6. This beautiful photograph was shot by Andrew P in Phoenix, Arizona. Apple says on its site: 'This desert shot takes full advantage of the warm reds and oranges of sunset, capturing a beautiful range of tones with a limited colour palette'

The selection included photos of children and pets. Noah W took the photograph of the dog (left) in Marina Del Rey, California using naturally occurring shadows to make the image more interesting, while  Ben C in Taichung, Taiwan took the photo of the tabby cat (right), which highlights interesting details, like the pattern in the cat’s fur and the texture of the cotton

All the impressive shots were taken using the iPhone 6, which has an 8MP iSight camera with a new sensor with Focus Pixels, improved face detection and exposure control. This striking photo was taken by Hyeong Jun K in Seoul, South Korea. 'The exaggerated scale of a shadow, like the one cast by the tree, can add an element of interest to a stark landscape,' Apple says

They will feature on billboards in 70 cities in 24 countries, MyModernMet reported.

Apple is said to have found them online and chose to feature them in the campaign, which aims to promote the photo power of the iPhone 6.

Each photograph is accompanied by a caption on the online gallery, which says where it was taken, whether an app was used to improve the shot and a tip about why it is a good photo, which amateurs could use to boost their photographic prowess.

For example, an image of a man in a field of sunflowers says: 'Photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo. Here, the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera'

The handset has an 8MP iSight camera with a new sensor with Focus Pixels, improved face detection and exposure control, ‘so you can take the photo and let iPhone 6 do the rest,’ the firm says. 

Together with improved video capabilities, it was one of the primary selling points for the handset, which got a more rounded look and sharpened screen too.

Apple found the striking images online and chose to feature them in the campaign for the iPhone 6. This image by Brendan Ó in Copenhagen, Denmark shows how taking a picture from an unexpected angle can add an interesting twist. 'Here, it creates contours in the lines that convey a sense of movement to the viewer,' Apple said.The photographer used an app called Snapseed to enhance the image

Mobile photography – that taken on phones instead of stand-alone cameras – is slowly becoming more credible. This photograph by Kim G in El Calafate, Argentina, juxtaposes a jagged glacier with trees and mountains so that the image is effectively divided in three

Mobile photography – images taken on phones instead of stand-alone cameras – is slowly becoming more credible.

For example, the World Photo Organisation (WPO) recently launched an extra category to the 2015 Sony World Photography Awards to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones.

‘Photography now exists in our pockets, and we want to celebrate this,’ it said.

The new category ‘allows us to look a little closer at those otherwise ordinary moments and to enjoy the creative freedom that mobile phone photography allows,’ it added.

There are more mobile phones on Earth than human beings and the number of devices is growing five times as fast as the population.

As well as the wonders of the natural world, many of the chosen photographs capture humans and art. This image of balancing fishermen was shot by Francis O in Inle Lake, Myanmar. 'Finding unexpected whimsy in a scene can make a photo more appealing — like this combination of nets, boats, and fishermen,' Apple says

Shots of people's feet are almost as ubiquitous as coffee cup art on Instagram but this image by Cielo D in Alameda, California is more interesting. 'Shooting your subject in a reflection — like the one on this wet street — can make a simple scene seem surreal and surprising,' Apple says

These two images show how the phone can be used for close-ups as well as landscape shots. Paul O, from Chicago, Illinois, captured a rainbow on his hand (left), while Cory S in Lake Cushman, Washington, shows the size of the trees by including a human in the right-hand image, as well as beautiful shafts of light permeating the leafy scene

The WPO says that mobile entries to the awards have ‘increased steadily year on year.

‘It was time for mobile phone photography to have its own dedicated platform, instead of taking the risk of losing some wonderful photos within the hundreds of thousands of entries we receive to the main awards.’

The competition was open to anyone who shot a photo with a smartphone, which could be printed out and shown at an exhibition.

It has just closed to new entries and up to 20 photos are being shortlisted by a panel of judges, before being posted online between March 10 and 17, so the public can vote for the winner.

The winning entries will go on show in London at an exhibition from April 14 to May 10.

Apple's online gallery offers photography tips in the captions. Commenting on this photo, taken by Jirasak P in Pasak Cholasit Dam, Thailand, the tech giant says: Photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo. Here, the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera'
