Google is facing a growing backlash over its ‘Glass’ eyewear, with cafe owners in the US banning the technology from their premises.

Dave Meinert, who runs the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, said those wearing the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in.

He has put up a sign on the wall which reads: ‘Respect our customers’ privacy as we’d expect them to respect yours.’

Invasion of privacy?: Google Glass can film what the wearer sees without any indication to others

The move comes after it emerged 
people wearing Google Glass could be banned from American cinemas, 
casinos and even parks because owners don’t want filming there.

The
 glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited 
release to 2,000 customers but will be more widely available later this 
year.

Should Google glasses be banned in cafes to protect customers' privacy?

A camera next to
 the wearer’s eye, which can take photos or record video without a red 
light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working, has caused 
concerns for privacy.

Casinos
 said the futuristic eyewear could help cheaters to win unfairly and 
cinemas said they could be used to illegally record films and sell 
pirate copies.

Lap dance clubs said that they would 
treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone 
caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out.

Parks departments and banks across 
America are also waiting to see how the new technology is used before 
deciding whether or not to ban them.

Dan Tench, of legal firm Olswang, which is co-ordinating a privacy lawsuit against Google in the UK, said: ‘This is the ultimate snooper’s gizmo. If you walk around with a video camera filming, it’s obvious what you’re doing, but with Google Glass, it’s much, much more invasive.’

Google’s chairman Eric Schmidt once admitted that the aim with such technology was to ‘go right up to the creepy line and not cross it’.

But the public clearly feels differently and in France those wearing Google Glass style specs have been subjected to ‘cyber discrimination’.

University of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head.
