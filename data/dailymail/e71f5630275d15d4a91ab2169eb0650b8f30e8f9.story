A stylish Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a large social media following has landed her first major fashion campaign.

Toast, a toothless dog with a drooping tongue and more than 155,000 Instagram followers, stars in Karen Walker's summer 2015 eyewear campaign alongside Ms Walker herself.

The popular pooch – who has received support from a number of the fashion industry’s elite, including Lucky editor-in-chief Eva Chen and Man Repeller blogger Leandra Medine – was rescued from a puppy mill in 2011 by Josh Ostrovsky, a 29-year-old New York City comedian who goes by the name 'Fat Jew', and his wife, Katie Sturino.

Shady behavior: The campaign sees Toast modeling various sunglasses alongside Ms Walker

The campaign sees Toast modeling various sunglasses, both by herself and alongside the designer; in fact, several of the images show Ms Walker and her canine companion sporting the same shades side by side. 

The New Zealand native, 44, announced that Toast was the latest face of her brand in an Instagram post Sunday, writing: 'This gorgeous redhead’s story is a true Cinderella one. She was discovered living in cruel circumstances, rescued, and quickly rocketed to fame thanks to her wonderful looks, charming personality and inimitable sense of humour.'

The accompanying image, which shows Toast wearing some chic tortoise-shell frames, has already garnered close to 5,000 likes.

The right look: 'We were after a model for this campaign who could fit with our caramel-y color palette,' Ms Walker said

Toast's owners also shared an image from the campaign on her Instagram account, noting: 'None of the photos are photoshopped. I'm just that good.' 

Ms Walker told Style.com: 'We were after a model for this campaign who could fit with our caramel-y color palette and also someone whose hair would work with our three wind machines hitting her from every angle to create a slightly ’70s vibe. Toast ticked every one of those boxes.'

According to WWD, hairstylist Gavin Harwin used fans to make Toast's ears flop in the wind.

Good cause: Ms Walker has  made a donation to Friends of Finn, an organization devoted to ending inhumane breeding practices in puppy mills

Ms Walker said that she was nervous about posing next to the famous pup.

'It’s pretty hard to compete with a toothless dog with its tongue hanging out,' she admitted.

Toast's teeth had to be removed when she was rescued because they were rotten.

Ms Walker has paid Toast's owners a modeling fee, and made an additional donation to Friends of Finn, an organization devoted to ending inhumane breeding practices in puppy mills.

Ms Walker's previous eyewear campaigns have featured other unexpected models, such as small children, Kenyan artisans and women from Advanced Style, a website that showcases the fashion of senior citizens.
