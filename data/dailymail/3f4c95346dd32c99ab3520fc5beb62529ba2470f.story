Boris Johnson wants raising wages further to be the guiding ‘Conservative economic mission’ in the next Parliament

Boris Johnson wants raising wages further to be the guiding ‘Conservative economic mission’ in the next Parliament.

The London Mayor, a leading contender to succeed David Cameron, believes reforms to make work pay should be ‘front and centre’ in the next phase of economic recovery.

His backing for a higher minimum wage allies him with Chancellor George Osborne and business minister Matthew Hancock, who have both been pushing the independent commission which sets its rate for above-inflation rises.

Mr Johnson also wants the Conservatives to consider tax breaks for firms paying the ‘living wage’, set above the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. The living wage is set at £7.85 an hour outside London and £9.15 in the capital.

The Mayor does not believe it should become compulsory for firms to pay the living wage, but wants the Tories to consider incentives to persuade more to do so.

He is thought to have studied a move by the Labour-run council in Brent to offer lower business rates to companies that guarantee to pay their workers at least the living wage.

A friend of the London Mayor said: ‘This is what Conservatives do well – it should be front and centre.

‘The Conservatives should be championing it [the living wage] because it rewards staff, engenders loyalty, and increases productivity - that means growth.’

As the economic recovery has gathered pace, Labour has made slow wage growth central to its attack on the Government’s economic record. There is growing political concern over Britain’s army of low-paid workers, with both Labour and the Tories setting out plans to increase low wages.

Last week, the Chancellor called on the Low Pay Commission for further above inflation increases in the statutory minimum wage. 

In October, more than a million workers got a pay rise as the minimum wage was increased by 19p to £6.50 an hour. It meant those on the lowest legal wage are set to see their pay rise by as much as £355 a year.

Chancellor George Osborne and business minister Matthew Hancock have also been pushing for the minimum wage to be upped

The pay rise it the first real terms cash increase since 2008, following recommendations from the Low Pay Commission after pressure from ministers.

Ed Miliband has said he wants to increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2019. Mr Osborne has proposed a legal minimum of £7 far sooner.

The number of people on the National Minimum Wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the think-tank the Resolution Foundation.

Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999. A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. It means one in ten workers are poorly paid.

Despite this year’s boost, a series of below-inflation increases mean it is worth the same in real terms as it was in 2005.
