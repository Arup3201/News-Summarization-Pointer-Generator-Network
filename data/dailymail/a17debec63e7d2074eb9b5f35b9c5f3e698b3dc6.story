As well as fame and fortune, Harry Styles, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Ryan Gosling all have something else in common; they're among the most lusted-after celebrities in the world.

But imagine if Harry hadn't landed a place in One Direction, Cheryl had been booted off Popstars The Rivals and Ryan hadn't secured a spot in The Mickey Mouse Club, what would they be doing - and look like - now?

A group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe's most famous and good-looking stars to see what they'd  look like if they hadn't found fame - and the team of hair stylists, make-up artists, plastic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package.

One group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe's most famous stars, including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, and what they imagine they'd look like if they hadn't found fame and stylists 

The design team created some concept images using existing pictures of a selection of Hollywood celebrities showing what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world. 

Writing on their blog, the team at VoucherCodesPro.co.uk write: 'Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips?

'No wonder the A-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the Hollywood elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet.

'This got us thinking, what would some of the biggest celebrities look like if they hadn’t become famous? Would they even still look recognisable without the teams of hair stylists, make-up artists, plastic surgeons and fashion consultants?'.

Harry Styles looks nothing like the luscious-locked teen heartthrob the globe's women lust over

Ryan Gosling has been treated to a makeunder and is a far cry from the heartthrob we know and love

Cheryl, 31, is barely recognisable without her glossy hair, picture-perfect make-up and dazzling veneers. 

The style she sports in her mocked up image isn't too dissimilar from how she dressed when she first found fame as a teenager from Newcastle with Girls Aloud.

Wearing a hot pink jacket, gold hooped earrings and slicked back hair, Cheryl's look is a far cry from the glamorous high-end style she's made her own on this year's X Factor. 

Harry Styles, meanwhile, looks nothing like the luscious-locked teen heartthrob the globe's women lust over.

With his unkempt hair, acne and bushy stubble, Harry probably wouldn't get a second look in the street. 

With her wild hair and fresh-faced look, Katie Price is a far cry from her glamorous self, right

Ed Sheeran has remained very down-to-earth since finding fame, which is reflected in his mocked up image

Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling, who stole the hearts of the world's women thanks to his turn in The Notebook, has also been treated to a makeunder.

With slightly ginger hair, sweaty, gaunt skin and a wife beater on, Ryan looks nothing like hopeless romantic Noah Calhoun from the hit movie.

Laidback Ed Sheeran, who seems fairly aloof about his appearance (unlike his friend Harry Styles), doesn't look that different from the way he looks in real life. 

In her image, Katie Price, who is currently starring on Celebrity Big Brother, has wild curly locks and a far more natural look to the one that's propelled her to fame.

The same team also famously gave Kim Kardashian a makeunder. With her dark rimmed spectacles, blotchy skin and bushy brows, the star is virtually unrecognisable. 

The design last year gave Kim Kardashian the 'unfamous makeunder' - and the results are startling

Rihanna looks fresh-faced and innocent in the design team's 'non famous' version of the singe

Sharon Osbourne, who has admitted to having plastic surgery, looks much older with her grey hair and winkles

The design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his perfect teeth
