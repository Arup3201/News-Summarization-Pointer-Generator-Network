Newly released video shows a panting Rob Konrad looking to speak to his family after surviving an arduous swim for his life.

The former fullback for the Miami Dolphins, 38, was picked up by police near the south Florida coast following an ordeal that started when a wave knocked him off his boat and the vessel went on without him on autopilot.

Police video sees Mr Konrad, his hair still wet from his swim, sitting with Palm Beach officers inside their cruiser and asking to contact his loved ones.

Video from a Palm Beach police cruiser shows former NFL player Rob Konrad, 38, right after his nine-mile swim

Mr Konrad, covered in a blanket, asked officers if he could call his family to let them know he was alive after the 16-hour ordeal

The man, who played in the NFL from 1999 to 2004, said 'Is there any chance I can get a phone to let my family know I’m alive?'

Officers then called his mother and asked her to contact his wife Tammy, the video obtained by TMZ shows. 

He was given a bottle of water and the heat in the car was turned to the maximum, after he rang a beachfront house's doorbell and the police came, according to ESPN. 

Wrapped in a blanket, he was treated at a local hospital for hypothermia, dehydration, and the breakdown of his muscle tissue.

The athlete, originally from Massachusetts, endured jellyfish stings and saw sharks below him during last month's 16-hour ordeal.

He fell off nine miles from shore, but estimates that he swam a crooked 27 miles in the water from 1pm to around 5am in the morning.

Mr Konrad asked what time it was, and had previously thought it was only midnight, according to the Sun Sentinel. 

Neither a recreational fishing boat or a Coast Guard helicopter were able to spot him, despite his best efforts.

Search parties were sent out after he missed a dinner date. 

He had been taking his 31-foot boat in for servicing when a wave rocked his boat right as he had hooked a fish.

The boat, on autopilot, left Mr Konrad without a life preserver as it continued at 5mph.

The former football player said that he decided he needed to swim to shore. 

'After some time I just said look, I’m not dying tonight and I’m going to make it to shore,' he told a press conference. 

Mr Konrad will not face charges or be cited for any violations, according to the Palm Beach Post. 

The boat was later found in the Grand Bahamas with $70,000 worth of damage.
