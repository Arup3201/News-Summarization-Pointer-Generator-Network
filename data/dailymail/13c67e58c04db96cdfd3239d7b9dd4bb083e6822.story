Diego Maradona has been labelled a psychopath after a video emerged appearing to show him assaulting his on-off girlfriend.

In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his girlfriend Rocio Oliva to have a go at her for using her mobile.

Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?'

She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. 

On Monday night Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knock England out of the 1986 World Cup, tried to ride out the storm by insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands.

He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.

'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.' 

Maradona is perhaps best known in England for his notorious 'Hand of God' goal past Peter Shilton

The former Napoli star, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, was put on the defensive after the 30-second video, secretly recorded by his former fiancee, was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme.

It is thought to have been recorded at the star's apartment near Buenos Aires when he returned to Argentina earlier this month after his father was rushed to hospital.

He is now back at his home in Dubai without either Oliva or former girlfriend Veronica Ojeda, with whom he has also been romantically linked in recent months despite dumping her when she was four months pregnant with their child Diego Fernando.

On Monday night Oliva's aunt branded him a 'psychopath and woman beater'.

It is not the first time Maradona has been accused of falling out with the 24-year-old, who he started dating at the beginning of last year after breaking up with Ojeda, 34.

In May last year he allegedly had a row with her on a plane. Passengers on board told how the pair exchanged insults and business class travellers, including a politician's wife, and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down.

The incident happened as he went to meet his baby son by Veronica Ojeda for the first time.

This summer he was also filmed slapping a male journalist he accused of winking at his former girlfriend.
