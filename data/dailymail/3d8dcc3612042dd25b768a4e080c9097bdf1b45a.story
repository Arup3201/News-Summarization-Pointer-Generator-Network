Stuart Lancaster has indicated it will be England’s forwards who will come under the selection microscope ahead of his side’s Six Nations decider with France.

The England coach has ruled out wholesale changes for Saturday’s Twickenham clash but hinted at freshening up his pack in a bid to counter France’s muscular eight.

Dylan Hartley’s position at hooker is under threat from Leicester’s Tom Youngs while his club team-mate Geoff Parling could replace Dave Attwood at lock after both men impressed off the bench against Scotland.

Alex Corbisiero could come into contention after Joe Marler was twice penalised for scrummaging offences, although concerns remain over the Northampton Saint’s shoulder.

The blindside flanker position will also be considered with Tom Wood vying with James Haskell for a starting spot.

‘Selection is based on the team we think is best suited to beat France and that will be the priority,’ Lancaster said.

‘I won’t be making wholesale changes. There were enough positives in that performance from players to show that there’s real potential there and the impact from the bench was strong.’

England’s management and players insist they have learned lessons from previous Championship deciders which have seen them fall at the final hurdle, including against Wales two years ago and Ireland in 2011 — before Lancaster took charge.

‘Getting the balance right in the week and making sure we don’t overdo it and play too early in the week is key,’ he said. ‘My experience two years ago was that when it came to the game we were probably emotionally beyond the point we needed to be.’

Going in to the final weekend of the Six Nations, four teams - England, Ireland, Wales and France - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy. Here's how each can be victorious.
