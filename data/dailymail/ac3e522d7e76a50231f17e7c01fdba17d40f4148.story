The Manchester United defence that finished the derby against Manchester City on Sunday was ‘the worst you’ll ever see’ according to Jamie Redknapp.

Redknapp, speaking on Sky Sports after the game, said Louis van Gaal’s side should take confidence from the way they finished the game, despite losing 1-0 to their city rivals.

But Sportsmail's columnist also criticised the defensive players on show, with United finishing with two midfielders and two teengers in their back-line.

Redknapp and the rest of the Sky Sports panel were impressed in the way the United side finished the game

‘Look at the back four they ended up with,’ said Redknapp. ‘Valencia, McNair,Carrick and Shaw. That's the back four for Manchester United. That's the worst back four you'll ever see!’

McNair, 19, came on when Marcos Rojo dislocated his shoulder, and allowed Sergio Aguero to escape him for City’s winning goal.

And the teenager is likely to have to continue in the United first team, after it was confirmed that Rojo will be out for some time, leaving Untied without a fit centre half.

Paddy McNair, up against Fernandinho at a set-piece, replaced the injured Marcos Rojo in defence

City meanwhile will take confidence from the win, after a 10 days which saw them draw with CSKA Moscow before losing to West Ham and Newcastle.

Sky pundit Graeme Souness said the result was huge in City’s title defence, but questioned their star players’ temperaments over the past couple of weeks.

‘Forget the derby, that was such a big game in terms of them winning the league again, winning that today,’ he said. ‘And that will give them another bit of confidence that they badly need.’

Manchester United defender Luke Shaw can't hide his frustration as his side fall to a derby defeat on Sunday

‘Getting beat is part of football, but you bounce back immediately. When you lose you want to be back the next day playing. Well City had a bad result in Russia, against West Ham, against Newcastle.

‘BIg players don't react like that. They should be better than that. They've got to get that confidence back quickly and start dominating games.

Antonio Valencia struggled to cope with Manchester City's attacking prowess as a make-shift right back
