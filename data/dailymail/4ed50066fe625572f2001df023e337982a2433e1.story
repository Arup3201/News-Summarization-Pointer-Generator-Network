The Florida college professor who is promoting conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting refuses to stand down from his outrageous statements.

'I think that the entire country mourned about Sandy Hook and yet, once again, the investigation that journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took place as far as I'm concerned,' James Tracy told a local television reporter on Wednesday.

The
47-year-old professor bases his outrageous allegations largely on the 
flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the 
shooting was released throughout the tragic day.

Still at work: James Tracy, 47, has been teaching at Florida Atlantic University for 10 years and refuses to lessen his stance against the official version of events regarding the Sandy Hook shooting

'While it sounds like an outrageous 
claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took 
place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the 
nation's news media have described,' he wrote in his blog post.

Now he adds that the confusion and so-called acceptance of the main stream version of events is telling of a larger problem.

'Well, I think that we need to as a society look at things more carefully. Perhaps we as a society have been conditioned to be duped,' he told Boca Raton's CBS 12.

This interview comes just one day after a Newtown official called for the professor to be fired his incendiary statements.

Patricia Llodra, the town selectwoman who has been helping Newtown deal with the logistics of the aftermath from the shooting, slammed Florida Atlantic University professor James Tracy after he made outrageous claims about the December 14 massacre.

Placing blame: Tracy says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the 'truth'

Outrages: Patricia Llodra (center), the town selectman for Newtown, says that Professor Tracy should be fired for his outlandish and insensitive claims

'Shame on you, FAU, to even have someone like this on your payroll,' she said of the tenured communications professor.

'It
is outrageous and an insult to all caring people to think that this man
would chose this event as a stage for his outlandish conspiracy 
theories,' she told FoxNews.com.

Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the timeline of the Sandy Hook tragedy shows that there was a coordinated effort to hide the 'real' story

'Professor Tracy is an embarrassment to me as an educator and should be to you as well,' Ms Llodra said.

'I can assure you, sadly, that the 
events here in Newtown unfolded exactly as are being reported, with the 
horrible outcome of the violent death of 26 innocent people, including 
20 children.'

Mr Tracy, however, appears to think that what he was saying was in keeping with his role as an educator and asking both his students and the general public at large to review the events critically.

'I describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual interested in going more deeply into controversial public events. Although some may see (my theories) as beyond the pale, I am doing what we should be doing as academics,' he told the Sun Sentinel.

As with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies, this is far from his first foray into the world of the unproven.

Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations.

On his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and Fukishima have all been topics of interest.

Shut down: Sandy Hook Elementary School is now closed, seen here on January 3, but a professor in Florida argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed

Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers

Even though he is paid to teach a class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far.

'James Tracy does not speak for the university. The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way. As for any previous disciplinary actions at FAU, we do not comment on personnel matters,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel.

Though his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature.

Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns

Predictably, his statements have sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the still-grieving Connecticut town where much of the last three weeks has been spent picking up the pieces.

'Is there something in the water in Florida that makes for idiocy,' commented Ray Gillies on the story by the local ABC affiliate WPBF.

'How dare you suggest this was a hoax and entertain that this didn't happen,' said a Sun Sentinel reader with the username JimNasium1.

'I'm afraid that you do not seem to be worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my kids students of yours, I'd withdraw them from your roster within the hour.You are NOT good at what you do and you suck as a human being.'

The moment he heard: Mr Tracy believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at Sandy Hook, and theoretically then this may not be the moment President Obama was told

Instead, he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog, memoryholeblog.com, and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory.

'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote.

He argues that Senator Dianne Feinstein was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s, and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker.

It is unclear if Mr Tracy has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns. Calls to Mr Tracy were not immediately returned.
