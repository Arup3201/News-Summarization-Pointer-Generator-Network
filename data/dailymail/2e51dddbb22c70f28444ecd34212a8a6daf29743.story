Doncaster defender Luke McCullough would welcome One Direction star Louis Tomlinson as an investor, having seen his passion for the club at first hand.

Reports have emerged in the past week that boy band heartthrob Tomlinson, 22, is interested in buying Rovers, who he has supported since childhood.

It is the latest development in the former X Factor contestant's love affair with his hometown club, which previously saw him sign non-contract terms as a player and turn out for the reserve team in February.

Tomlinson's substitute appearance, in aid of Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice, put 5,000 on the usual gate for Doncaster's second XI and gave an insight into the kind of interest he can generate.

McCullough, currently in Chile on Northern Ireland's South American tour, played alongside Tomlinson that night and was left in no doubt about the singer's motives.

'Louis is from Doncaster, he's a nice quiet local lad and a fan of the club so it must have been a dream for him to play,' he said.

'It was a strange atmosphere, thousands of young girls screaming through the match trying to get a glimpse of him.

'He was just helping the club, doing his bit for Donny, because he's a fan. It was good for the charity and good for Rovers too.

'It raised the profile of the club and the Twitter following has gone through the roof. It's definitely put us on the map a bit more.'

Having experienced the 1D effect at close quarters, McCullough, who had to ask Tomlinson for his autograph on behalf of his sister, would have no qualms about him taking a more substantial role.

'He's made a lot of money for himself and he's broken America but he's a season ticket holder,' he said.

'It would probably be a dream for him to be involved with the club and as players we don't mind who runs it.'
