A woman lost a staggering 6.5 stone after being hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted with a gastric band.

Janice Rodgers, 46, tipped the scales at 17st 7lbs and became desperate to find a solution.

When she researched weight loss surgery online she stumbled upon a website about a ‘virtual band’- a treatment that hypnotises you into believing your stomach has shrunk in size.

Super slimmer Janice dropped a staggering 6.5 stone after being hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted with a gastric band

Although doubtful she decided to give it a go - paying £270 for a year’s worth of sessions with a therapist called Andrew Nelson.

When she came to after the first treatment she was in disbelief the hypnosis had worked but gradually began to lose weight, slimming down to a trim 11st in just seven months after the treatment made her physically unable to eat unhealthy foods.

She stopped eating junk food like 
crisps and fried chicken and embarked on a two week plan of just liquids
and gradually introduced solid food over time.

Janice
lost a staggering 12lbs in her first week and dropped from size 22 to size 12 in seven months thanks to the virtual gastric band.

Janice spent £270 on the hypnotising course, which made eating 'normal' food impossible

She has since stuck to a diet of salads, fruit, healthy wholegrains and and lean, grilled meat and 
still listens to mp3 recordings of her sessions to keep her motivated.

Janice, a care worker from Manchester,
said: 'I had been overweight for 23 years, since the birth of my son, 
and tried everything to lose weight.

'I signed up for weekly weight loss classes but any weight I lost I would just put straight back on.

'I started going to Zumba classes with two slim friends but by the end of each session I was gasping for air.

'I knew I needed to do something about it so I logged onto the computer and looked up gastric bands without telling anyone.

'I was shocked with the amount of websites I found, but among them was Andrew’s which mentioned a hypnotic band.

'After researching that I decided to book an appointment, the price was reasonable and I though I would just give it a go.

'I decided not to tell anyone because I felt like a fool but I was just so desperate to lose weight.

'When
I first went I thought it would be a load of rubbish and I felt no 
different until I went home and tried to eat something but it felt like 
chewing carpet.

'I thought I had better look at the eating plan, which was just liquid for two weeks and then gradually worked up to solid food.

'After eating a lot over the years I didn’t think I could do it but I found it so easy and never felt hungry at all.

'The
weight came off so fast and in my first week I dropped 12lbs. I still 
can’t believe I have reached a size 12 and I sometimes do pick up my old
size in the shops.

The care worker physically can't eat unhealthy food anymore, she says it tastes like carpet

'My partner, Steve Kirkham, is really proud of me.'

Andrew Nelson said: 'The virtual gastric mind band is made up of cognitive behavioural therapy, neuro-linguistic programming, and mental preparation.

'The treatment begins with an initial discussion where I ask people to visualise themselves as they want to be and we talk about healthy eating.

'People eat for a variety of different reasons and once we have realised the cause I then put them under hypnosis and reaffirm what we have talked about.'
