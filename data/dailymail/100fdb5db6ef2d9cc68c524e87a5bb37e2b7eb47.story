This terrifying video shows three boys risking their lives by dangling from a 50m crane - with their bare hands.

One of the daredevils is even filmed hanging from the top of the giant structure with one hand.

The death-defying stunt appears to have been done without any safety equipment and Met Police believe it is a copycat of a Channel 4 documentary on urban free climbers.

Dangling: A teenager holds on from the top of a crane in Wallington, south London, with just one hand

Their death-defying ascent is captured on a wearable GoPro camera and appears to have been done without any safety equipment

The two-minute video, which has been uploaded to YouTube, starts with their late night climb up the green crane in Wallington, near Sutton, Surrey.

Once at the top, one of the fearless trio - all thought to be in their teens - films himself walking along a narrow beam at the top of the crane.

The excited hoodie-clad boy clicks his fingers like TV comedian Ali G, pulls his scarf over his mouth so only his eyes are visible, before hanging from the crane with his bare hands.

Another boy, wearing a black coat and a scarf, smokes a cigarette before having a go himself.

Finally the third teenager, wearing a black hat and a black Adidas jacket, goes one step further.

He drops down and removes one of his hands for a few seconds so he is dangling with just one hand before scrambling back up to safety.

The trio bump fists in celebration at their stunt.

Police are looking to see if any offences have been committed.

It is believed to have taken place in the early hours of Sunday and was uploaded to YouTube later that day.

A message posted by the boy who uploaded the video said: 'Such an epic mission. Freerunning is our life! Please like and share the vid!! Much luv peeps...Safe.'
