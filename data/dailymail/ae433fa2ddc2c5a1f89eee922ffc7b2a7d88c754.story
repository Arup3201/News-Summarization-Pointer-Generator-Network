The mayor and his family were headed for a vacation in Chile this weekend.

Chicago Police spokesman Thomas Sweeney didn't name the victim but says police are investigating an attack Friday night near the mayor's home. 

He says two males grabbed the victim, took his phone and fled.

WGN-TV reports that one mugger allegedly 'threw him in a chokehold' while the other allegedly punched Zachary to the ground.

'The offenders then asked the victim, "What else you got?" (and) forced the victim to enter his security code to unlock the phone,' a police report obtained by The Chicago Tribune stated. 

A neighbor of the mayor told WGN-TV, 'It still happens everywhere you go,' implying that crime can occur even in the safest and most policed of neighborhoods.  

Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff, is running for re-election in February.
