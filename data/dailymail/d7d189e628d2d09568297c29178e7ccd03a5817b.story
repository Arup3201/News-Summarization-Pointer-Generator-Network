Three friends with learning difficulties, including one with Down's syndrome, have been turned away from their local pub after being told they weren't good enough to perform karaoke.

Singer James Smyth, 23, said he was barred with his friends, David Griffiths and Keiffer Courtney-Lee, because they were out of tune and 'bad for business'.

The trio of Beatles fans wanted to sing versions of the Fab Four's Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine on Friday nights.

But last week, staff at The Abington pub in Northampton refused to let them go up on stage.

Alex Duggan, who cares for the men in Ryan QC Homes supported accommodation, told the Daily Mirror: 'The DJ handed out Â­songbooks to all the tables in the pub, but not to our residents.

'He said he was not allowed to let the residents sing anymore.'

But pub landlord Neil Bartholomey denied saying the singers were bad for business, insisting they were just terrible vocalists.

James was not allowed to perform because 'he just shouts words - there is no tune', according to the chairman of Northampton Pubwatch

Mr Bartholomey, who is also chairman of crime/anti-social behaviour monitoring group Northampton Pubwatch, added: 'James was asked not to sing purely on his ability. He just shouts words.

'There is no tune. James is a pleasant, well presented lad, he just can't sing.

'The karaoke guy organises the entertainment and if it's not successful, he won't come any more.

'It has nothing to do with whether people have a disability, it's about whether people can entertain and sing.

'Everyone has a right to have a go but if their audition is not successful, they do not have the right to sing again.'

Laurie Duggan, director
 of Ryan QC Homes, said the pub's stance was nothing to do with singing 
ability.

She told the Northampton Chronicle that the decision was 'totally inaccurate and insulting'.

Ms Duggan said there was a wider issue at stake than that of them not being able 
to sing karaoke.

She added: 'We are totally 
distraught that here we are in 2011 with very clear discrimination 
against three young men, purely based on the fact they have a learning 
disability.

'It is most definitely not about singing ability because karaoke is not about singing ability.'
