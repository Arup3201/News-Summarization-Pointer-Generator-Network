The former New York University professor who was arrested for stalking and harassing her married ex-lover was today bailed out of jail by a Brooklyn sewer cleaner she has never met.

Dutch economist and educator Heleen 
Mees, 44, is accused of sending more than 1,000 emails to chief Citigroup 
economist Willem Buiter - a married father-of-two - over two years.

She had been languishing in Riker's Island prison up to this point, unable to post the $5,000 bail.

But the kind-hearted Brooklyn man came to her rescue and came up with the money last night, spending hours of his holiday pushing paperwork through the court.

Heleen Mees changed her outfit after she appeared in court today and was set free on $5,000 bail paid by Leon Alfonso, a Brooklyn sewer cleaner

Mees did not talk to her rescuer Leon Alfonso, who runs the Main Drain sewer cleaning company, despite the fact he spent six hours pushing through paperwork in Brooklyn court yesterday - a national holiday

Leon Alfonso, 45, told the New York Daily News outside Manhattan Criminal Court today: 'I've never met her, I didn't know who she was, but I saw in the paper she was friendless and I wanted to help her out. I'm a religious man, I believe in God, and he just laid it on my heart.'

Mees made a brief appearance in front
of the judge today, not realizing the man responsible for her freedom 
was also in the room.

Love triangle: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children

The 44-year-old - whose name was once
on the short-list for Secretary of Finance - was reminded by the judge 
that she is not allowed to contact her former lover or his family.

She was arrested on Monday accused of
sending Buiter thousands of emails which contained threats, 
sexually-charged language and explicit images.

'What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b***s?' Mees allegedly wrote to her paramour.

'Hope your plane falls out of the sky,' the embittered Mees wrote to Buiter, according to court documents.

In another letter cited by The New York Daily News,
the ex-adjunct professor at NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate
School of Public Service allegedly suggested that she and Buiter adopt a
child.

Her attorney, Vaneshka Hyacinthe, has claimed her client 'had a 
long-standing relationship' with Buiter and 'the emails go in both 
directions'.

Court papers filed in the case against 
Mees paint a portrait of an unhinged woman who bombarded her married lover with a 
slew of increasingly bizarre and disturbing emails between July 1, 2011, 
and Monday, July 1, 2012, including one sent May 3 that included an image of dead 
birds. 

Mees did not talk to Alfonso, who 
runs the Main Drain sewer cleaning company, despite the fact he spent 
six hours pushing through paperwork in Brooklyn court yesterday - a 
national holiday.

Heleen Mees set out from her home in a light summer dress after appearing in Manhattan Criminal Court in the morning. Mees is being tried on charges of harassing her ex-lover and his family

'I got close to her and told her I was the one who paid her bail, but 
she didn't react. Stoic, was how I'd describe it,' said Alfonso. 'I 
guess she was probably trying to pay attention to the judge.

'It really took a long time to get 
her freed, but I felt that an independent woman like her shouldn't be in
jail on Independence Day.

Mees stayed cool in the summer heat as she ventured out of her apartment in a light floral print dress after appearing in court for stalking her ex-lover

'When they gave me the receipt for her bail, it said she would be in court today so I figured I'd come meet her.'

Mees wore a green sheath dress and 
beige stilettos when she appeared briefly this morning. She is due back 
in court on August 19.

Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands

Buiter, a native of the Netherlands, is married to economics professor Anne Sibert, and the couple have a 22-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter.  

Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands. Her area of expertise is monetary policy and emerging economies.

It is believed that the brilliant economist and vocal advocate for the advancement of women in the workplace has become obsessed with her distinguished lover.

Mees even dedicated her PhD dissertation to Buiter and thanked him for being 'so kind' to meet with her in the summer of 2008 in London, according to the New York Post. 

According to the court filings, the 44-year-old alleged stalker also harassed Buiter's wife and children despite her ex-lover's repeated requests that she stop her barrage of messages.

On February 27, Mr Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter, but that did nothing to deter the lovesick professor, who proceeded to fire off several hundred more emails to him, according to court documents.

Willem Buiter has chaired the World Economic Forum and was on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. In 2010, he was hired as Citigroup's chief economist.

Over the past three decades, Buiter had taught economics at some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including Princeton, Yale and Cambridge universities. His wife currently teaches at University of London's Birkbeck college.
