They were apart for the romantic occasion.

So America's First Couple took to Twitter to declare their love.

In a nod to the Beatles' song All You Need Is Love, Michelle Obama tweeted: 'Love is all you need. #HappyValentinesDay, Barack. -mo'.

The loving message was accompanied by a picture of the pair in a tender embrace.

President Obama wished his wife a happy Valentine's Day at the end of his weekly address earlier on Saturday.

Presidential love: This is the message Michelle Obama tweeted to her husband from across the country

He is spending the holiday weekend working on his golf game in Southern California. 

Obama traveled to Southern California without his wife, Michelle, or their daughters, Malia and Sasha on Thursday.

There was no word from the White House on how the first lady was spending the weekend. 

Obama arrived in the desert resort area of Palm Springs on Saturday morning after a short flight from San Francisco and went straight to the golf course on the grounds of the Sunnylands retreat in nearby Rancho Mirage.

He played several rounds on the nine-hole course with Bobby Titcomb and Greg Orme, childhood friends from Hawaii who flew in to meet the president.

Marty Nesbitt, one of Obama's friends from Chicago, rounded out the foursome, the White House said.

The president had no public events scheduled during his weekend getaway from the White House. 

He was expected to spend most of his daylight hours swinging golf clubs in the desert heat, as he has done on visits to the area in each of the past two years.
