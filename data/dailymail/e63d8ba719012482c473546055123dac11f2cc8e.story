Verdict: Simon Gittany arrives at court with his new girlfriend during his trial. He was found guilty of murder today

The Australian businessman accused of throwing his girlfriend to her death from the balcony of their luxury Sydney apartment has been found guilty.

Simon Gittany, 40, had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment with his hand across her mouth.

Just over a minute later, she had plunged to her death - and Justice Lucy McCallum, in a damning assessment of Gittany’s character, said she did not believe his account of how his fiancee had fallen from the balcony.

As the verdict was delivered in the New South Wales Supreme Court Gittany stood still while his girlfriend Rachelle Louise started screaming.

Ms Louise yelled at the judge, and was taken from the court in floods of tears while Ms Harnum's family members smiled and embraced after the verdict was handed down.

Crowds gathered outside the court as Justice McCallum, who had sat without a jury during the four-week-long trial, began delivering her verdict in the case which has gripped the nation.

She stated that Gittany was 'controlling, dominating and, at times, abusive' of Ms Harnum.

She found he lied 'with telling ease' and distorted the truth when he took the stand.

'At many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person playing a role, telling a story which fit with the objective evidence but which did no more than that,' Justice McCallum  reported News.co.au.

'His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.

Guilty: Simon Gittany, 40, had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment with his hand across her mouth

'It lacked originality and the subtlety of actual experience.'

The
Crown had told the court that Gittany was domineering and had tried to 
control everything his fiancee did, even the way she wore her hair and 
what clothes she chose to go out in.

Gittany had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘jealous partner.’

‘She
would wear revealing clothes, sometime with no bra. I would tell her 
she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she
was revealing of her body so she didn’t attract the wrong attention and
give out the wrong signals,’ he told the court.

But
his defence team claimed that Miss Harnum’s struggle with an eating 
disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death.

The
judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between 
Gittany and his fiancee, saying she had sought to avoid being influenced
by the ‘shocking and tragic’ nature of Miss Harnum’s death. There was 
no doubt, she said, that the couple loved each other.

But the judge said that ‘by the time of her death, Lisa Harnum had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor.

Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above)

Gittany,
she said, had used CCTV cameras to monitor Miss Harnum’s movements in 
their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was 
‘intrusive and overbearing.’

Judge
McCallum said the relationship reached the point when Miss Harnum 
changed her Facebook status to ‘single’ and had signed a contract to 
store her belongings in Bondi as she prepared to leave her controlling 
fiancé.

On the day that 
Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags, said the judge, he 
reacted ‘with nothing short of rage’ and she did not accept his denial 
that he had made enraged threats. ‘I have no hesitation accepting 
evidence of…rage,’ said the judge.

His denials were ‘manifestly implausible…he was controlling and abusive…out of control,’ she added.

Gittany
sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being
delivered, his new girlfriend, brunette Rachelle Louise sitting in the 
public gallery.

By the end 
of July Gittany’s relationship with Miss Harnum had reached crisis 
point, the judge noted. ‘I do not think there can be any doubt the 
accused was controlling, dominating and at time abusive.’

The
night before her death, the couple had watched Romeo and Juliet in bed 
before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend’s death.

‘I
find it difficult to believe he was watching porn’ on the morning of 
the death,’ said the judge, adding she assumed he had instead got up to 
monitor her emails and text messages.

'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge. 

She
referred to a witness, Josh Rathmell’ who had told the court of seeing 
Gittany throwing something from the balcony, evidence, she said, that 
was ‘compelling’.

The judge 
did not believe Gittany’s account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death -
he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto 
the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. ‘It’s difficult to 
articulate my impression of that evidence except that I found him 
unconvincing,’ said the judge.

'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge

'At
many times in his evidence, the accused struck me as being a person 
playing a role, telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence
but which did no more than that.

‘His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.’

As
Justice McCallum’s verdict details entered their fourth hour, Gittany’s
girlfriend began to sob, while he stared straight ahead at the judge. 

The judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man.

She
said Miss Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had
- clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints.

She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death.

Speaking outside court, an emotional Joan Harnum told reporters 'there are no winners in this case'.

'Two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever,' she said reported Nine News MSN.

'We
will always mourn the loss of our beautiful Lisa Cecilia and are 
working towards making her legacy a powerful wake-up call to young 
women.

'My daughter used to say people can ask for help but children and animals cannot.

'And now young women who are caught up in situations like my daughter found herself in need a voice as well.'

Gittany will face a sentence hearing in February.
