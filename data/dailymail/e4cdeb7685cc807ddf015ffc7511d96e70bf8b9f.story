Beach ball sized spiked rovers could soon be rolling around the surface of Phobos, if a groundbreaking new design for rolling rovers if given the go-ahead.

Stanford researchers, in collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have designed the 'hedgehog' probes.

Dropped from a mothership, each rover would hop, tumble and bound across the cratered, lopsided 
moon, relaying information about its origins, as well as its soil and 
other surface materials.

The rovers would drop from a mother spaceship, and then be able to 'hop' across the surface, before tumbling to their final locations and take measurements from the surface

An entire mission would last two to three years, and just flying to Phobos would take the Surveyor about two years.

Then the initial reconnaissance 
phase, during which the Surveyor would map the terrain, would last a few
months.

The mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs 
several days apart, allowing scientists enough time to decide where to 
release the next hedgehog.

Developed by Marco Pavone, an assistant professor in Stanford's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the system consists of a mother spacecraft, known as the Phobos Surveyor, and the rovers it houses, called 'hedgehogs'.

The Phobos Surveyor, a coffee-table-sized vehicle flanked by two umbrella-shaped solar panels, would orbit around Phobos throughout the mission.

The researchers have already constructed a prototype.

The team say the hedgehogs could be the first step to exploring Phobos

'It's a piece of technology that's needed
before any more expensive type of exploration is considered,' Pavone 
said

'Before sampling we need to know 
where to land.

'We need to deploy rovers to acquire info about the 
surface.'

The Surveyor, or mother ship,  would release only one hedgehog at a time.

Together, the mothership and hedgehogs would work together to determine the hedgehog's position and orientation.

Using this information, they would map a trajectory, which the mother craft would then command the hedgehog to travel.

The hedgehogs do not have wheels, as do 
the current Mars rovers.

Instead they rely on three rotating discs 
enclosed within each hedgehog, with each disc pointing in a different 
direction.

The rover is controlled via three flywheels, and is powered by solar panels on its exterior

A prototype of the hedgehog the team has already built. they plan to test future versions on parabolic flights to simulate zero gravity

The spiky explorers would relay scientific measurements back to the Phobos Surveyor, which would forward the data to researchers on Earth.

Based on their analysis of the data, the scientists would direct the mothership to the next hedgehog deployment site. 

An entire mission would last two to three years, and just flying to Phobos would take the Surveyor about two years.

Then the initial reconnaissance phase, during which the Surveyor would map the terrain, would last a few months.

The mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs several days apart, allowing scientists enough time to decide where to release the next hedgehog.

For many decisions, Pavone's system renders human control unnecessary.

'It's the next level of autonomy in space,' he said.

To confirm Phobos' origins, Pavone's group plans to deploy most of the hybrids near an area known as Stickney Crater.

Besides providing a gravity 'sweet spot' where the mother craft can stably hover between Mars and Phobos.

The crater also exposes the moon's inner layers.

The team has already built two prototypes, and plans to test the hedgehogs in a reduced-gravity aircraft, also known as a 'vomit comet,' essentially an airplane flying a parabolic path. 

The plane climbs and then pitches downward, at which point it begins a low-gravity free-fall lasting about 25 seconds before pulling up again.

During each parabola, the researchers will test a different hedgehog maneuver. 

A test of the Phobos Surveyor will likely take place in two to four years.

Pavone hopes that a Phobos Surveyor mission, which could occur within the next 10-20 years, will bring scientists closer to a human mission to Mars.

'The bottom line is that there is a growing interest in the exploration of small bodies,' he said.
