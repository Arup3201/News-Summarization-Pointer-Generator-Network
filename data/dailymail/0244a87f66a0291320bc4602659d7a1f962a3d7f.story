The Duchess of Cambridge joined members of the Royal Family for her first Christmas at Sandringham

Dressed head-to-toe in a festive berry shade the Duchess of Cambridge couldn't stop beaming as she celebrated her first Christmas at Sandringham.

All eyes were on the 29-year-old as she attended a community service with her husband, Prince William yesterday morning.

She teamed a simple knee-length frock coat with black £180 platforms from LK Bennett, but the real head turner was a hat by milliner Jane Corbett, who regularly creates pieces for the Middleton family.

A pair of diamond drop earrings – possibly a Christmas present - were also on display as she wore her hair in a half up, half down creation

Other members of the royal family who attended the private service included the Queen, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge.

Kate's presence helped attract a record 3,000 well-wishers to St Mary Magdalene church on the Norfolk estate and police were on hand to manage crowds.

The Queen opted for a lavender wool boucle coat by her dressmaker Karl Ludwig, upon which she had pinned a diamond shell brooch with a pearl at the centre, with a matching white and ivory hat by Angela Kelly.

She accepted dozens of bouquets helped by three of her grandchildren, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and the Wessexes’ daughter Lady Louise Windsor.

Zara Philips, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie also looked elegant in understated ensembles.with clutch bags to hand.

Zara  – who now uses the surname Tindall – attended the traditional event with her husband,  Mike, wearing a black collared coat topped with a
black ruched hat.

Sisters Beatrice and Eugenie, who accompanied their father Prince Andrew, both selected smart double breasted pea coats in shades of black and grey accessorised with matching berets.

Many were eager to hear about Prince Philip's health after the 90-year-old was admitted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge last Friday after suffering chest pains.

Greeting members of the public, Prince
Charles told Carmilla Fitt, 71, from Dover, that his father’s health 
was ‘coming on’. He added: ‘He is very well and in very good spirits. He
is very determined.’

Asked
by other wellwishers about his grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge said 
he was ‘very well, thank you – getting much better’.

Commentators were surprised by the turnout on Christmas Day, and thousands of fans battled to get a photograph of the Duchess as she walked along the church pathway.

Alison Croose, from King’s Lynn, said: ‘I have not seen crowds like this since back into the Diana days.

‘It
reminded me of the Diana years – when she introduced Prince William to 
the crowds when he was about seven or eight. It was touching. Diana used
to have her hand on his back.

‘Now you see William with his hand on Kate’s back. It was really nice.’

After returning to the main house for 
Christmas lunch and, of course, the Queen’s Speech on television, the 
royal grandchildren left the family gathering to visit Prince Philip in 
hospital, arriving at 4.14pm.

William
drove his cousins, Peter Phillips and his sister Zara, in a Land Rover.
Behind him Prince Harry was at the wheel of another 4X4 accompanied by 
Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

The group stayed for 45 minutes – just enough to raise the elderly duke’s spirits on Christmas Day without tiring him out – before returning to Sandringham.

Buckingham Palace officials said Philip ‘remains in good spirits’ and added: ‘The Queen will continue to be briefed on his condition. We do not have details of a release date at this stage.’

The duke was airlifted to hospital on Friday night after complaining of severe chest pains and was discovered to have a blocked artery which was starving his heart of oxygen.

He underwent a ‘minor’ invasive procedure under local anaesthetic to insert a stent into the artery, freeing the flow of blood.

The prognosis is extremely good, although doctors are understandably cautious about a man of his age.

Poignantly, the Queen celebrated the importance of the family in her Christmas Day message yesterday, highlighting the recent weddings of her grandchildren, Prince William and Zara Phillips, as a reminder of the ‘God-given love that binds a family together’.

Sadly, she said, it often brought tragedy to bring out the best in people but stressed that in time of hardship, families provided the strength to see the hard times through.

‘In this past year my family and I have been inspired by the courage and hope we have seen in so many ways in Britain, in the Commonwealth and around the world,’ she said.

‘We’ve seen that it’s in hardship that
we often find strength from our families; it’s in adversity that new 
friendships are sometimes formed; and it’s in a crisis that communities 
break down barriers and bind together to help one another.

‘Families,
friends and communities often find a source of courage rising up from 
within. Indeed, sadly, it seems that it is tragedy that often draws out 
the most and the best from the human spirit.’

She
added: ‘The importance of family has, of course, come home to Prince 
Philip and me personally this year with the marriages of two of our 
grandchildren, each in their own way a celebration of the God-given love
that binds a family together.

‘For
many this Christmas will not be easy. With our Armed Forces deployed 
around the world, thousands of service families face Christmas without 
their loved ones at home. The bereaved and the lonely will find it 
especially hard. And, as we all know, the world is going through 
difficult times.’

With his elder brother taken off the market, it was Prince Harry who was the subject of most female attention.

Several shrieking girls in the crowd  tried to attract the 27-year-old prince’s attention.

He obliged by giving one a kiss. Inundated with requests from other fans, he blushed and said: ‘I can’t give you a kiss. I’ve already kissed her.’

Also in the royal party, Canadian-born Autumn Phillips – daughter-in-law of Princess Anne – patted her bump protectively. She is expecting her second baby with the princess’s son, Peter, in the spring.
