People who are obese top the list of the five types of passengers Britons would least like to find themselves sitting next to on a flight.

Unsurprisingly the second most hated neighbour is a screaming baby, while those with poor hygiene come in at third, a new survey shows.

Flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk conducted the research as part of an ongoing study into airline passenger experiences during a flight, questioning 2,548 adults about their likes and dislikes while flying.

Although the least-favoured neighbour on a plane is someone obese, a crying baby reliably comes second

1 Someone overweight or obese: 32%

2 A screaming baby: 29%

3 Someone with poor hygiene: 21%

4 Someone scared of flying: 17%

5 Someone who doesn't stop talking: 16%

According to the poll, 32 per cent of Britons said they didn't want to sit next to obese people because they didn't want them 'encroaching into the seat space'.

In order to determine if this was purely a UK feeling or something that was becoming more common throughout Europe, 1,000 people from European countries outside of the UK were also polled. 

Respondents from Spain (26 per cent) and France (23 per cent) also listed ‘someone considered obese’ as the person they would most like to sit next to.

The biggest response in supposedly child-loving country Italy listed ‘a screaming child’ (18 per cent) as their least favourite seat fellow.

German respondents voted ‘someone who doesn’t stop talking’ as their biggest bugbear (16 per cent).

Most of those who stated they'd least like to sit next to someone overweight said it was because they wanted their seat space to themselves without having someone encroach into their space (73 per cent).

'It's saddening to hear that people wouldn't want to sit next to someone on a flight because of their weight, but it's completely understandable that they want to find some comfort on the flight they've paid for,' said Jetcost.co.uk co-founder Antoine Michelat.

'We've always thought that screaming babies on a flight were the most annoying, but people are getting much better at coping with this situation as they understand that babies are babies and there's nothing that can be done to soothe them on a flight when their ears pop, or the air conditioning gets too much for them.

'Some companies are already looking into introducing a section on their planes for people over a certain weight, and whilst this is a good thing for those who don't want to find someone using their own seat and half of theirs too, it does run the risk of fat-shaming those who can't necessarily control their weight.'
