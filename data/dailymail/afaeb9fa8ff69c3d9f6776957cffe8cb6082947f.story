It's the hottest ticket in town and only a selection of VIP guests will get to sit on the front row at Burberry's London Fashion Week show in Hyde Park this afternoon. But that doesn't mean you have to miss out on seeing the latest styles from the luxury British brand, as Femail will stream the action live from the catwalk.

The live stream of the Prorsum Spring/Summer 14 collection will be available to watch below and on the MailOnline Femail channel as it unfolds at 2.30pm.

This isn't the first time the British brand have harnessed the latest technology to stream their 
show.Â

In style: The Burberry trench was reinvented in an array of colours at the Spring/Summer 2013 show. See what's in store for 2014 by watching our live feed at 2.30pm

Earlier this year, MailOnline previously gave readers the chance to watch the Spring/Summer 13 show as it happened, watching models such as Cara Delevingne strutting down the catwalk in the season's heart motif clothes that have gone on to be sell-outs.

This season's styles are expected to have as big an impact as Burberry's chief creative officer Christopher Bailey is famed for his ability to reinvent trends whilst still staying true to their more-than-a-century-old heritage. This has meant the brand's flagship trench coat has remained a wardrobe staple as Bailey has experimented with colours and fabrics to keep a traditional style looking fresh - and often imitated by High Street stores.

Last season he gave us metallic trench coats in shades of the rainbow. Bright colours could remain a theme in this year's show as Bailey previously enthused about his love for them to the MailOnline: 'When you see colour, it changes the way you see the world. It makes people happy,' he said.

Must-have: Heart designs featured featured heavily in February's show and many items went on to sell out

The brand was founded in 1856 but has moved with the times under Bailey. Their flagship Regent Street store in London is not just a place to shop but a hub of new technology with interactive mirrors, concert-quality sound systems and giant screens streaming their catwalk shows.

They are also keen to engage with audiences around the world via social media platforms and to this end, for today's show from Hyde Park, they have joined forces with Apple to share pictures and video of the show on social networks using the new iphone5.

Speaking to the MailOnline after last season's show, Bailey said it's all about involving people around the world and making them feel part of the experience - even if they can't be there in person.

He said: 'It's about doing something that makes people smile, that makes people want to engage, whether it's online, whether it's physical, whether it's at the show like this.'

Once again, the catwalk show will come from a specially-made venue in London's Hyde Park

The brand have also integrated themselves with the music scene, regularly staging live shows and discovering new talent. At February's show, the then unknown Tom O'Dell sang and played the piano on stage as the models took to the catwalk. He's since gone on to win a Brit Award and have a number one album including the hit songs Another Love and Hold Me.

Music is expected to pay a part in this afternoon's show and while they may again go for a little known musician, you can bet they'll go on to follow in O'Dell's footsteps and become a star.

In their most recent advertising campaign, Burberry teamed with These New Puritans frontman George Barnett and actress Suki Waterhouse to promote their Brit Rhythm men's fragrance with a rock and roll theme.

Barnett and Waterhouse are likely to be front row guests today, and could perhaps bring their others halves Pixie Geldof and Bradley Cooper. Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and his girlfriend Kim Sears often never miss the show while Olympian Victoria Pendleton, singer Rita Ora and model-turned-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley were among those on last season's start-studded front row.

But you don't need to have won an Olympic medal or had a hit single in order to see this season's clothes first if you check back here at 2.30pm. Join the fashion pack to get a first look at the Burberry Spring/Summer 14 collection thanks to our live steam.
