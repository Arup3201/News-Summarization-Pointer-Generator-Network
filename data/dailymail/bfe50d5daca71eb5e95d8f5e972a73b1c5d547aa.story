Popular among first-time drivers and mothers on the school run, Volvo has long been a favourite among motorists. 

And while the Swedish brand may have a holding with the average driver, few would consider it a thrill-seeker's choice, much less the manufacturer of Britain's fastest car. 

But that is exactly how daredevil Guy Martin has described his speedy run-around, after modifying a 1967 Vox Volvo estate to make what he claims to be the fastest car in the country.

The 1967 Volvo Amazon was modified by Swedish supercar engineers to reach speeds of more than 200mph 

The car has been hailed by owner Guy Martin as 'the fastest in Britain' and can outrun a Ferrari on racetrack 

The 45-year-old car was adapted in Sweden to include a 788 horsepower engine and specialised gearbox 

Bought in 2012, the car has been adapted by supercar engineers who installed a 2.8-litre turbo charged engine and six-speed gearbox.

With a 788 horsepower engine, it can reach 60mph in three seconds and has thrown dust on the bonnets of some of the world's flashiest vehicles.

'I reckon it is about the fastest car in Britain - quicker than any Ferrari, Porsche or even Bugatti,' wrote Mr Martin in a recent column for the Sunday Times. 

'My GSXR Suzuki superbike is about 220bhp and probably a bit quicker to 100mph, but if you put them on the road together the Volvo would leave it for dust between 100mph and 200mph.' 

'The truth is, this is the quickest machine I have ever driven or ridden.'

After becoming disillusioned with his Aston Martin V12, ('What? You have to put the lights on manually? That seemed a bit... ostentatious'), the 32-year-old bought the car two years ago after being shown a photograph of it at a TT race. 

The car, originally made in Sweden in 1967, has had its  interior transformed and a six-speed gearbox installed

After being showcased at events around the world Mr Martin bought the car which he described as 'perfect' 

Motorcyclist Guy Martin said he felt the Volvo gathers speed more quickly between 100 and 200mph than his Suzuki motorvike 

Engine: 6.2-litre supercharged 

Horsepower: 1244 bhp 

0-60mph: 2.7 seconds

Top speed: 270.49mph 

Price: $1.25mlilion

Horsepower: 788 bhp 

0-60mph: 3.1 seconds

Top speed: 205mph

Now, Mr Martin uses it on special occasions when his other car, a Ford van, isn't suitable.  

'It is perfect — the best-built, most beautifully finished car in the world,' he added.

The fastest car int he world is the Hennessy Venom GT which recorded 270mph earlier this year in America. 

A Bugatti Veyron Supersport with a top speed of 268mph was sold in London last year, though it is not known whether or not it is still in the UK. 

Gary Tolson, a sales manager at Tom Hartley in London, said to his knowledge it was the fastest car in the UK. 

'We sold a Bugatti Veyron Supersport here around 18 months ago, which is a production car. 

'Someone can put together a kit for a car that can reach 200mph though.' 

The Bugatti Veyron Supersport (pictured) has a top speed of an estimated 268mph. One of the cars was sold in London last year for around £1million
