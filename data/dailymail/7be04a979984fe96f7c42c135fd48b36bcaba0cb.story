Christian Wade may be a London boy but the Wasps winger looked right at home in Coventry with a performance against Sale to suggest that he is back to his best.

His game had everything but a try as the England hopeful danced around two-footed Sharks defenders to inspire the Ricoh Arena journeymen to another dominant victory at their new base in the Midlands.

The 23-year-old has spent the majority of the last 12 months on the sidelines and used his spare time to work on upper body strength, with director of rugby Dai Young suggesting the speedster should be right in contention for the Six Nations.

‘It’s not for me to say who should and shouldn’t be selected, but I wouldn’t swap him for anyone,’ said Young. ‘He is by far one of the most exciting wingers with ball in hand and he’s as good a finisher as anyone, but he doesn’t always get the credit he deserves for creating opportunities. He was outstanding for us.’

Wade caused problems from the start, jinking past two defenders to make valuable yards, before Andy Goode kicked his side ahead with a third minute penalty. Wasps were simply too quick and, after three points from Joe Ford to level the score, Wade again played a major role in the opening try.

Ben Jacobs set the one-cap international free with a sublime no-look pass and skipper James Haskell was on hand to finish the move. Few players offer the same levels of entertainment as Wade, who will no doubt be a major selling point if his club are going to maintain the healthy crowds that have turned out for their first two fixtures in Coventry – with 15,343 in attendance on Sunday.

‘The crowd were excellent, so we need to give performances that they want to keep coming back to,’ said Young. ‘We want to turn this place into a real fortress.’

Nathan Hughes extended the lead with a try just before the end of the first quarter, but Ford’s accuracy with the boot helped keep his side in the game. 

The No 10 kicked nine points inside the opening 23 minutes, before the floodgates opened. Goode added a dropped goal and Joe Simpson sniped over just before half time, finishing a bizarre play that saw full-back Mike Haley ripped in mid-air after being held by Wade and Bradley Davies.

‘We were given a good hiding really,’ said Steve Diamond, the Sale director of rugby. ‘We weren’t the abrasive side that we normally are and we will have to look at that in training.’

Not even the second-half introduction of Danny Cipriani, who Young singled out for praise in his programme notes, could stem the flow of attack. Simpson sealed the bonus point with his second try following some standoffish tackling, before Ashley Johnson scored off a driving line-out to break the 40-point barrier.

With James Gaskell in the sin-bin, Sale added some respect to the scoreline with a 75th minute try from Andrei Ostrikov, but Wasps were home and dry with an easy win to move them into fourth place.
