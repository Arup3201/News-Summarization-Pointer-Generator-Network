Sunderland captain John O’Shea has been rewarded with a two-year contract extension at the Stadium of Light.

O'Shea, who has prolonged his stay until 2017, has recently been in the headlines after his midweek heroics for the Republic of Ireland.

Winning his 100th cap against world champions Germany, the 33-year-old pounced in stoppage-time to earn an invaluable 1-1 draw for Martin O’Neill’s side.

‘Since I arrived at Sunderland I have enjoyed every minute and I’m really happy that I can continue here for another two years,’ said the former Manchester United defender.

‘To captain a club like this and to play in front of our fantastic supporters is a huge honour and I look forward to showing my commitment to the club on the pitch in the years to come.’

Manager Gus Poyet added: ‘I am delighted that John has agreed to stay with us for at least another two years. He is our captain, one of our leaders and I am sure he will continue to help us get better and stronger as a team. I really look forward to continuing to work with John.’
