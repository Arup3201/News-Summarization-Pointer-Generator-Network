A crime-scene officer has been accused of carrying out 'substandard' work potentially undermining 90 criminal cases, including one that involved a death.

The police watchdog has confirmed it is now conducting an investigation into the 'quality of work and qualifications' of the 48-year-old man, who was employed by Staffordshire Police and Cleveland Police between 1996 and 2011.

A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the inquiry was examining 90 cases and investigating claims that the officer lied about his qualifications which involved an arson case.

Investigation: A scene-of-crime officer who worked at Cleveland Police has been accused of potentially undermining 90 criminal cases by carrying out 'substandard' work

The watchdog is inspecting cases which 
have raised concern in the Cleveland Police force area, including an 
investigation into a death which has been reopened.

The IPCC have notified families affected by the 90 cases in Cleveland and confirmed the investigation began in February 2011 when the scenes-of-crime officer was suspended from duty.

The unnamed employee, who resigned from his post last October, is currently on police bail after being arrested in May 2011 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

Major Incident Teams at both Staffordshire and Cleveland Police have been working on the investigation, under the direction and control of the IPCC.

In a statement, the IPCC said: 'The managed investigation is examining allegations that the man conducted sub-standard work, potentially undermining investigations into a range of incidents including suspicious deaths, and had lied about his qualifications when involved in arson investigations.

'The investigation has so far examined
all incidents that the man was involved with and narrowed the focus 
down to 90 cases where concerns exist in the Cleveland Police force 
area.

Allegations: A police station in Staffordshire. The officer under investigation worked for the force between 1996 and 2002

'One investigation 
into a death in Cleveland has been reopened as a result of the initial 
findings of the managed investigation.'

The
scenes-of-crime officer worked for Staffordshire Police from 1996 to 
2002, Northumbria Police for a short period in 2002 and Cleveland Police
from 2002 to 2011, although no concerns have been found relating to his
employment with the Northumbria force.

IPCC
Commissioner Nicholas Long said: 'This has been a long-running and 
complex investigation involving three police forces and covering a 
period of 15 years.

'We 
wanted to ensure we reached a stage where we could inform those families
directly affected rather than publicise the investigation earlier and 
possibly create concern for a larger number of people.'

Mr
Long added: 'The allegations are serious and had the potential to 
impact a large number of investigations. The number has been narrowed 
significantly by the work already undertaken.

'As this remains a criminal investigation we do not intend to go into specific detail about cases at this stage.'

Cases that the crime-scene officer worked on are being investigated after he was accused of 'sub-standard work'
