Blyth Spartans are faced with a dilemma – use the momentum of the FA Cup run to bid for promotion, or allow their heroes to win a promotion of their own with an offer from the Football League?

The seventh-tier club – the lowest-ranked team in the third round and who led 2-0 against Birmingham before the Championship side turned the tie around – will attempt to do both.

The Spartans – who won a new Twitter follower in Luis Figo on Saturday - have ambition. But they have loyalty, too.

Manager Tom Wade explained: ‘This is a crucial point in the club's history. How we do in the next month will decide the next few years. If we don't take advantage and build we will just float around and we don't want that.

‘We have to make this club into something special. We have got the team to do it and the momentum is there.

‘But yes, we have already had three or four inquiries and there were scouts watching our players (on Saturday).

‘I would be very disappointed if I didn't get a few calls in the next week or so. I think a lot of these lads deserve a chance to be full time. If you put some fitness and strength into these lads they could be world beaters.

‘They'd definitely go with my blessing. We wouldn't stand in their way.’

Dale of Blyth Spartans scores his side's first goal after the 35th minute to take a surprise lead

Newsagent Jarrett Rivers, 21, is one player courting attention from above and he laid on the first goal for barman Robbie Dale, who has long since turned down professional advances.

The 30-year-old put Blyth in dreamland with a solo second but by the hour mark those hopes were dashed, Lee Novak and Wes Thomas (2) netting three times in six minutes for the Championship side.

Dale, though, is fully signed up to the Spartans cause and wants to see the revenue from the cup run invested in the side.

‘You could get hammered off a team like that, so we’ve shown what a good side we are by giving them a proper game,’ he said.

‘Our last cup run paid off a lot of the debts. There was money invested in the team last time, but we need to make sure it’s the right investment and that it’ s the right players who come in.
