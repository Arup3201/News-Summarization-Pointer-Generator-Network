More than £250,000 has been paid out to four civil servants accused of harassment, breaking safety laws, gross misconduct and not finishing work on time, it emerged today.

The spending watchdog uncovered an extra 84 cases where controversial ‘compromise agreements’ where officials were paid off in a reward for failure, on top of 1,000 revealed in June this year.

It included pay-offs for staff who had fallen out with colleagues, a bungled investigation into allegations of harassment and an attempt to sack an NHS manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety.

Spending: Secret payout deals for civil servants risk being seen to 'reward failure', the National Audit Office said (file picture)

The National Audit Office launched a probe into spending at the departments of health, culture and defence after revealing earlier this year that 1,053 gagging orders had been signed by government departments and the NHS since the general election, costing taxpayers £28million.

It found that the government had approved some severance pay-outs in cases involving ‘failure or inappropriate behaviour’.

Official Treasury guidance states that payments that ‘reward failure, inappropriate behaviour or dishonesty should not be approved’.

But today the NAO said: ‘We found business cases referring to elements of alleged gross misconduct or staff harassment.

‘These alleged behaviours do not meet the standards of the Civil Service Code.’

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, now run by Maria Miller, was singled out for particular criticism

In some cases pay-outs were agreed because government departments and agencies feared they would lose an industrial tribunal if the employee went to court.

The NAO stressed that official Whitehall rules make clear that severance payments ‘should not be treated as a soft option, e.g. to avoid management action, disciplinary processes, unwelcome publicity or reputational damage’.

The Treasury must also not approve ‘special severance payments that reward, or will be seen to reward failure, dishonesty or inappropriate behaviour’.

But among 19 pay-outs agreed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it found four which included examples of alleged failure or inappropriate behaviour.

It included payments to three staff accused of ‘failure’, including breaching health and safety rules, ‘not producing work when requested’ and not demonstrating the ‘behaviours, values and full commitment’ expected from a senior manager.

In a fourth case a member of staff was suspended pending an investigation into allegations of harassment towards colleagues.

All four payments, valued at a combined total of £251,000, were approved by the Treasury.

The allegations were upheld but due process was not followed, and as a result the punishment was reduced to a final written warning.

The NAO added: ‘However, the hearing caused a breakdown in trust and confidence between the individual and a number of senior colleagues, and the arm’s-length body decided to terminate the individual’s employment.

‘Legal advice set out that the arm’s-length body had a slightly less than even chance of winning a claim for unfair dismissal even though the arm’s-length body believed that it had acted reasonably throughout.

‘Legal advice estimated potential compensation and legal costs of some £80,000 due to the nature of claims made, the witnesses required and the likely length of any hearing.

‘The Treasury approved a special severance payment of £16,000 for this case.’

Some payments were signed off because managers had failed to follow internal policies and procedures.

Threes pay-outs were agreed by the Ministry of Defence because employment rules had not been followed and the government risked having to pay compensation.

The NAO looked at 95 cases across five ministries totalling £3.4million.

It found the Department of Health had 23 cases, including payouts worth more than £250,000.

The Department for Education agreed deals worth up to £220,000, Ministry of Defence £120,000, Communities and Local Government £40,000 and Culture, Media and Sport almost £150,000.

Of the 95 cases, 84 contained compromise agreements, and 74 included a confidentiality clause which stops the employee from revealing even the existence of the deal.

Two contained what the NAO called a ‘gagging clause’ which stopped health workers from pursuing further complaints with a number of organisations, including the Care Quality Commission and the Department of Health.

Procedures: The Ministry of Defence was criticised for making payouts to staff after failing to follow its own employment rules

The NAO said: ‘There is a risk that clauses like these might discourage the employee raising genuine concerns about service failure with the appropriate oversight bodies.’

In one case a manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety was later fired over  concerns about their own behaviour, but later restored after an employment tribunal.

In the meantime their job had been made redundant, so they were paid off, with a confidentiality agreement stopping them from speaking out again.

It also found examples where severance payments were agreed in response to failure to comply with internal policies and procedures.

In three cases in the defence sector, managers had not followed the internal policy in relation to the employment of staff.

As a result, severance payments were approved to avoid claims for compensation.

It included the Ministry of Defence making a payment to a practice nurse working as a contractor for the forces after official guidance was not followed.

The NAO has urged the government to issue guidance to departments on the use of compromise agreements and publish data on their use to pinpoint bodies with ‘unusually high numbers of agreements’.
