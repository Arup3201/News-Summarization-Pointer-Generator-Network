A North Dakota school has come under fire for suggesting that some of its female pupils dress like prostitutes.

In a bid enforce its dress code, Devil's Lake High School showed students a clip from Pretty Woman in which the character played by Julia Roberts is humiliated in a shop for looking like a sex worker.

When she returns the next day in high-end clothing, she gets a far warmer reception.

Stunt: Julia Roberts with Richard Gere in Pretty Woman after her character Vivian Ward is humiliated in a clothes store for looking like a prostitute. The clip from the film was shown to female pupils at Devil's Lake High School in North Dakota in an attempt by bosses to get girls to adhere to its dress code, much to their anger

Bosses said they hoped the footage will discourage girls from dressing provocatively in tight pants and leggings.

But students reacted with anger at the stunt after it was shown during a dress code assembly and the principal was later forced to admit the tactic was a poor choice.

One pupil said: 'I get how that lady (in Pretty Woman) was judged by what she was wearing, but we don't wear that kind of stuff to school.'

Psychotherapist Dr Stacy Kaiser said the message could be damaging to the girls in the longer term.

She told ABC7: 'The message it is sending to the girls is that they dress like prostitutes.

'And they are sexualizing them instead of treating them with self-respect.'

The backlash at Devil's Lake has sparked a wave of reaction across the United States, with pupils in other schools  taking issue with the public shaming of girls for not wearing the correct uniform.

Often, these schools are sending them home, saying their clothes are distracting the boys.

One group of students at a middle school in New Jersey has launched the hashtag #IAmMoreThanADistraction campaign to press for a fairer dress code policy that doesn't discriminate girls.

Dr Kaiser said: 'This message is telling boys that if a girl is dressed in a provocative way, they have a green light to behave any way that want. And that can be very dangerous.'
