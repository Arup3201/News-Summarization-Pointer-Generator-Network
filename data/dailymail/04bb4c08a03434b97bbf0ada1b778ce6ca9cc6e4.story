Exotic yet easy to care for, it's no wonder Phalaenopsis are the country's most popular houseplant, accounting for a whopping 50 per cent of the market.

You might imagine that these elegant plants - also known as moth orchids - are bred in steamily tropical climes before being imported to Britain, but actually, many of the orchids we buy are grown here. Even more surprisingly, they all start their life in a decidedly unglamorous test tube.

A decade ago, orchids were an expensive treat: the only way to propagate them was by seed and it took years to bring an orchid to maturity.

All that changed with the invention of micropropagation, a cloning technique which allows a small section of flowering stem to be replicated in a laboratory. Suddenly orchids could be produced in just two years and, as prices plummeted, demand soared.

Although there are thousands of different varieties of orchids, it's the Phalaenopsis, with their upright stems and open flowers, that we've fallen in love with.

One of the big orchid growers in the UK is Double H Nurseries in Hampshire, which recently celebrated more than 50 years in business. It supplies plants to Marks & Spencer and Tesco, and as well as begonias, chrysanthemums and poinsettias, the company produces 1.5 million orchids a year.

The Phalaenopsis, with their upright stems and open flowers, are the most popular breed of orchid.

A giant glasshouse full of orchids in flower is a truly dazzling sight; wave after wave of white, pink, yellow, lime green and magenta, as far as the eye can see. 

These massed blooms have no scent, but that may change soon. 'There'll probably be a scented orchid on the market within ten years,' predicts Double H's commercial manager, Gary Shorland.

'The holy grail is a true red - that's probably five years away.' What about a blue orchid, I ask hopefully. 'Not within my lifetime,' Gary says, adding with a grimace, 'those blue ones you see in shops are dyed.'

The company sources its young orchids from a laboratory in Germany. For the next year and a half the plants are grown on in the nursery: first in steamily hot temperatures where they get up to 20 hours of light; then, to encourage them into bloom, in a cooler glasshouse.

Twenty-four hours after leaving the nursery, the orchids will be on sale in the shops.

You can get orchids for under a tenner, but most of them sell for between £10 and £20. Phalaenopsis are popular all year round, but for Mother's Day sales go up five-fold.

New and interesting orchids can sell for thousands  of pounds at auction to commercial growers, and in the next few years  we can expect to see lots of 'vintage-style' varieties - flowers in dusky pinks, or speckled with brown, or  with frilled edges.

As Gary says,  'Phalaenopsis need hardly any care and they'll flower for up to three months, with new flowers opening every week. They're amazing - they really are the perfect indoor plant.'
