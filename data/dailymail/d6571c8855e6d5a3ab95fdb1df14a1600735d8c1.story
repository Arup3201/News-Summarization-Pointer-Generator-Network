You may think that people living 100 years ago in cities of smog and steam-powered machinery could scarcely imagine our modern world today.

And yet old postcards drawn by artists reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets from the vacuum cleaner and FaceTime, to large submarines.

The intriguing colour sketches, called En L’An 2000 (In the Year 2000), look strangely familiar despite being created between 1899 and 1910.

The future is calling: Over 100 years ago, French artists drawing scenes for cigar boxes dreamed up futuristic gadgets such as this cine-phono-telegraph, which allows people to speak over the telephone and see each other on a screen at the same time - much like Skype and Apple's FaceTime

The quirky cards show a host of recognisable scenes including one picture, called Correspondance Cinema-Phono-Telegraphique, which depicts a man relaxing in a chair while he makes a video phone call - akin to Skype or Apple's FaceTime, which people rely on today.

The mechanical forerunner to the iPod – an automated orchestra - is included in the scenes, as well as a futuristic dictation machine designed to allow important businessmen to dictate notes and letters without the need for a secretary.

Face to face: The old postcards drawn by artists over 100 years ago reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets - including video phone calls, such as FaceTime (pictured)

Skating on thin ice? The French artists envisioned a snowmobile which would allow people to explore Antarctica and see the penguins (pictured). Today, numerous vehicles can traverse the hostile icy terrain and holidays are even offered for tourists to see the wildlife and vast icebergs

Music to our ears: The mechanical forerunner to the iPod - an automated orchestra, is pictured. Automatons and music boxes were popular in the 19th century, but a system to provide enough volume for a theatre (pictured) was a dream

Meals on wheels: As soon as the weather is warm enough, a stream of RVs and caravans can be found trundling down to the seaside and scenic spots. But this was a novel idea 100 years ago and the artists imagined a literal mobile home, complete with a chimney, fine dining on a balcony and a mobile garden

Another image, entitled A bord d’un Paquebot sous-marin, shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today – or perhaps the underwater observatory which is currently home to Fabien Cousteau who is living underwater for a month.

Dreaming of another age of exploration, 
the artists also penned scenes of people living in a submarine, 
travelling from Paris to Peking by train and using a snowmobile to see 
the penguins of the South Pole.

All at sea: Shipwrecks and accidents still happen today, but the artists envisioned a specially-equipped flying machine that could reach sailors in peril in even the worst weather conditions (pictured)

A high flier: Today, search and rescue helicopters patrol remote coastlines and can swoop down and hover close to the water's surface to rescue marooned sailors, as well as people stuck on rocky headland (pictured)

Back to the future: This postcard shows a couple waterskiing - or even using skis that work a little like Back to the Future's hover boards. Interestingly, while the leisure equipment is futuristic, the people are still wearing traditional clothing of the 19th century

Great Scott! Scientists are still working on creating technology that flies like the hover board seen in Back to the Future 2 (pictured) and they can now levitate and tiny particles

Take this down: No important businessman or industrialist would be without his own mechanical Dictaphone in the year 2,000, according to the artists. Here, a high flier talks to a machine to record his thoughts instead of using a secretary - a process we have been familiar with for several decades

Another drawing, entitled Les Patins Cloches a Eau, shows a couple water-skiing in an image, which wouldn’t look entirely out of place today if it wasn’t for the vintage clothing.

They even resemble the hoverboards from the film Back to the Future.

In a different scene, called Un Frotteur electrique, a happy maid watches as an electronically-powered broom sweeps the floor in a historic vision of the vacuum cleaner.

Life aquatic: This image, entitled A bord d'un Paquebot sous-marin, shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window, which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today, or even underwater laboratories used for studying marine animals

Getting their skates on: This image, entitled Auto-Patins a Roues, is a vision of futuristic powered roller skating, where each skate has a motor attached. The artist who drew the scene even foresaw accidents - as seen when wearing similar gadgets that exist today

Wheely great: They may not look like the powered roller skates in the 19th century picture, but these modern skates let people glide along with no effort at all as they are battery powered

How illuminating: This scene, Un Palais oceanien, shows a futuristic exploration of the underwater world by means of a submarine shining beams of light in the darkness. Today, navies around the world use submarines that can stay under water for months and personal vessels allow individuals to explore the sea floor

Sketches of gadgets designed to make womens’ lives easier, also include a kitchen full of machines, some of which we take for granted.

For example, most modern kitchens have ovens, blenders and drinks makers, and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge or using a smart cooker.

The postcards were originally published in France and distributed inside cigar boxes.

Interestingly, while the artists dreamed up whimsical machines, there were more conservative when it came to people's clothes, as the figures in the drawings are dressed in their 19th century finest.

The dream clean machine: This  postcard shows a happy maid watching as an electronically powered broom sweep the floor. It would appear that the artists predicted the invention of the modern vacuum cleaner - although did not foresee that most families would be cleaning their houses themselves

All abroad for the year 2,000: Dreaming of an age of exploration, the artists penned scenes of people living in a submarine and travelling from Paris to Peking by train (pictured). The engine has a nose that resembles a fighter jet

Full steam ahead: The 19th century may be regarded by some as the golden age of rail travel, when steam engines meant that more people could travel longer distances more comfortably. But today, trains can cross continents and Russian Railways offers a journey from Paris to Beijing (formerly known as Peking).  We are even working on concepts like Hyperloop which could travel at 760 mph (1,220 km/h)

Voila! Artists seem to have predicted the voicemail. A Missive phonographique - or futuristic recorded message, is brought on a tray by a servant (pictured). Today the service comes neatly built in to most phones

They were created by a variety of artists including Jean Marc Côté, and were designed to show  visions of the world 100 years into the future.

At least 87 different cards were produced with sets being printed in 1899, 1900 and finally in 1910.

This is the news: In the future, French artists imagined that people could listen to the newspaper - much like a radio news bulletin. They did not predict the television or MailOnline though for keeping people up to date with what's going on in the world

Floating like a butterfly: Un Hydroplane - a futuristic hydroplane, can be seen skimming along the surface of the sea. Today, we still use this method of transportation and it has been adapted for land too

A kitchen fit for Heston Blumenthal? The French artists imagined a world where people did less of the chores themselves and kitchen were packed with gadgets. Most modern kitchens have ovens and drinks makers (pictured) and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge

The appliance of science: Our kitchens are getting smarter all the time with ovens (pictured) able to be turned on using phone apps, or able to offer recipes, while fridges can use Wi-Fi connections to order groceries

While the gadgets are futuristic, people's clothing in the scenes remained traditional - and women wear dresses while water-skiing
