A man has been charged with assisted attempted suicide following an incident where he allegedly provided an injured man with the means to set himself on fire, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Kevin Howe, 19, was charged following an incident in his home town of Bishop Auckland, County Durham, on May 26 in which a man suffered severe burns.

Stephen Walker was discovered engulfed in flames in the front garden of his own home as horrified neighbours, including children, looked on.

The 30-year-old victim was discovered 
burning by a police officer on patrol in the Woodhouse Close estate on 
the evening of May 26.

He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, where he was treated for 'significant burns', Durham Police said.

A joint investigation between Durham Police and County Durham and 
Darlington Fire and Rescue Service was launched to determine 
exactly what happened.

Three fire engines were called to the scene and crews had to extinguish a small blaze in the ground floor of the property.

Howe had previously been charged with a count of encouraging or assisting an offence of arson with intent to endanger life following the incident, the CPS said.

He is due to appear at Durham Crown Court on September 9.

Elizabeth Reid, specialist prosecutor in the CPS’s special crime division, said: 'I have concluded that Kevin Howe should face one charge of assisted attempted suicide in relation to an incident on 26 May 2013 in Bishop Auckland, in which a man was severely burnt.

'It is alleged that Kevin Howe provided the injured man with the means to set himself on fire.

'In accordance with our duty to keep all cases under review, I have now concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to replace this charge with one of assisted attempted suicide.

'This decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the Director of Public Prosecutions’ guidelines on cases of encouraging or assisting suicide.'
