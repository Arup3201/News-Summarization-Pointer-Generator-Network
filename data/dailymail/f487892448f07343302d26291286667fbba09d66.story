When it comes to judging players, there are not too many more qualified than Kaka. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA World Player of the Year, beating Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to the accolade that season, has selected the best eleven players he has played alongside or against for Sportsmail.

It is a diverse mix of astonishing ability and experience from the different eras his career has spanned to date, from his humble beginnings at Sao Paulo in 2000 to joining MLS side Orlando City in 2014.

Playing for AC Milan twice and Real Madrid in between has meant there are few of the planet's superstars of the past 15 years that he has not played for or against.

In a team packed with stars, there is no place for Lionel Messi in his side. Here, in his own words, Kaka takes you through his best XI.

KAKA'S TOP FIVE GOALS: From a solo strike against Man United to a deflected free-kick for new side Orlando City

GOALKEEPER 

Dida 

I played with Iker Casillas for four years at Real Madrid, but for me Dida is the best goalkeeper. 

We played together and won together at AC Milan and for the Brazil national team. 

He is an unbelievable keeper.

DEFENCE 

Cafu

Every time I have to say something about players that I've learnt a lot from, I talk about Cafu. He won the World Cup twice and the Champions League, but still he worked every day to win. His motivation was always victory in the next game.

Paolo Maldini

He is similar to Cafu. He won five Champions Leagues, he won Serie A seven times, he won so much, but he was always the first to arrive and the last to go home from training. He was the perfect example to a player.

Alessandro Nesta

The Italian players, they see the game in a different way to other nations. They grow up learning about tactics so when they play professionally they can see where to position themselves and how to move and what the opponents will do. It made Nesta such a strong defender and he was so quick, too.

Roberto Carlos

What an amazing player he was. So exciting at left back. I enjoyed playing with him. He was quick, strong and could hit some unbelievable free kicks and shots at goal.

MIDFIELD 

Andres Iniesta

He makes the toughest things on a football pitch look easy. That's the biggest compliment I can pay him. How he plays, everything seems so simple. This is what I like about him.

Zinedine Zidane

I never played with Zidane, just against him. It was wonderful how he played, how he moved around the field. It was like he was gliding. What he could do with a football, it was sometimes impossible to imagine.

Andrea Pirlo

I loved to play with Pirlo. I think he's one of the greats. He sees the action before anyone else does on the pitch. My position was to play behind the lines, and he found me every time he could find me.

ATTACK 

Cristiano Ronaldo

I will have the three Ronaldo's up front, starting with Cristiano. I learnt a lot from him, which helped in my career, when we played for Real Madrid. He is the best player on the planet at the moment, a special player.

Ronaldo

For me, the Brazilian Ronaldo is one of the best strikers in the history of the game. He is different to anyone. I would have to say he was the best player I played together with. His speed, his dribbling, his finishing, his movement. I love him.

Ronaldinho

I played against Lionel Messi, but Ronaldinho makes my final slot. He is a genius. He can do things with the ball you don't understand. During training you see a lot of things you don't see in the game. In training he was free from the emotional part, the responsibility of matches. In training he was free to do what he wanted.
