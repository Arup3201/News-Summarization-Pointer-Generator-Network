A serial killer who cut up his victims and sold their remains as 'ostrich meat' on the local market has been executed in southwest China.

Zhang Yongming, 57, was found guilty of murdering 11 people and selling parts of their flesh, state media reported.

When police searched his home they found eyeballs preserved in wine bottles, such as is traditional Asian practice with snakes to make 'snake wine', and dried human meat.

Mr Zhang was known amongst his neighbours in the village as the ''Cannibal Monster'.

Today he was ‘escorted to an execution site and executed’ on Thursday after being sentenced to death in the southwestern city of Kunming in July, state-run news agency Xinhua said.

Neighbours told a local newspaper that they had seen green plastic bags hanging from his home with what resembled white bones protruding from the top.

Mr Zhang, who 'cut his victims into pieces to cover his tracks’, had a previous conviction for murder, but was released in 1997.

Upon entering  his home police found the 
'eyeball wine' and human flesh hung up to dry and fear he 
may have also fed his victims to his dogs, according to Hong King 
newspaper The Standard.

Although the notoriously secretive 
Beijing administration refuses to  publish its execution statistics it is believed to have the highest rates in the world.

The 
latest report from Amnesty International predicts 'thousands' every 
year, whilst U.S.-based advocacy group the Duihua foundation estimated that 4,000 prisoners were executed in 2011.
