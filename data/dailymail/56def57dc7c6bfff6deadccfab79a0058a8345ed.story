A Christmas day flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles diverted to Albuquerque after a row escalated over a passenger singing along to Blake Shelton's hit song 'Boys 'Round Here'.

A man sitting in first class on Delta flight 81 was escorted off the plane and met by police officers on landing after the pilot decided there was a security risk on board.

Fellow passengers become irate when the Wichita man sang along with his headphones and complaints were passed on to the airline staff.

After being confronted by a male passenger on board, the man, who was released without charge after the incident, told Eyewitness News: 'I asked the gentlemen, sir what am I doing wrong? Can you tell me what I'm doing to you sir? All you have to do sir is talk to me about it.'

At this point, as more people began to get involved in the incident, the man became upset and started to cry before disappearing into the toilet.

NBC news reported that after references to the ongoing troubles in Ferguson, Missouri, and the fact that 'the man stated he was being harassed because he was black,' the pilot took the decision to land the plane.

Passenger Lauri Springer tweeted the ordeal as the plane turned around and was met by police cars when it touched down in the New Mexico city last Thursday.

Ms Springer said she learned there was a problem on board when the pilot informed passengers that the aircraft was turning around due to a ‘security issue’.

When the plane arrived at the gate police officers boarded the aircraft and detained a disruptive passenger who was making threats, she said.

The plane spent around two hours in Albuquerque before resuming its journey to Los Angeles

The University of Alabama student, who was heading to California for a  family holiday, wrote in a tweet: ‘And then everyone applauded the police officers and pilot and flight attendants for handling it so well.’

The passenger was not charged but he was not allowed back on the plane when it departed for Los Angeles around two hours later.

Passengers had spent nearly seven hours on the plane before they finally arrived in Los Angeles.
