Just look who Usain Bolt ran into today. 

The world's fastest man was reunited with Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Commonwealth Games for a chat at the event's Athlete's Village.

The Royal trio and the Jamaican sprint star shared a joke and posed for photographs in the athletes’ village in Glasgow as hundreds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the visitors.

Bolt may have been discussing with the royals what he'll do in the men's 4x100 relay on Friday, or gently reminding Harry of the time he beat him in a race in Jamaica before the London Olympics two years ago.

William, Kate and Harry also played ball games with school children after meeting some of the host nation’s medal winners at Team Scotland’s accommodation.

They were joined on their tour of the site by the country’s most successful Olympian Sir Chris Hoy, who is also chieftain of the village.

Their visit comes the day after they joined thousands of spectators at the Games, taking in gymnastics, boxing, hockey and swimming. 

After arriving at the village in the east end of the city today, they met Scottish judo gold medal winner Chris Sherrington and swimmers Ross Murdoch and Erraid Davies.

They were then given a tour of the recreation facilities for the athletes, where William played video games with some of the Welsh women’s hockey team.

The six-time Olympic champion asked a friend to take a picture of him and the royal for his Twitter page when they were reunited

All three moved on to the village green where they heard a performance of the Games’ anthem for Unicef from a group of local school children.

They then joined in the ball games traditionally played in countries from across the Commonwealth.

Kate listened as one of the children explained the rules of a game which includes knocking down three tins with a ball before running in to the middle of the square, rebuilding them and hopping over the tins three times.

She cheered as she knocked the tins over and looked up and smiled after completing the task in her high wedges.

The brothers later faced each other in opposing teams as they played the same game.
