A woman who stole her severely disabled brother's £62,000 inheritance to fund lavish spending sprees has been jailed for three years.

Jane Martin, 51, plundered the bank account of her vulnerable brother Vaughan Martin after their elderly mother died and left him the five figure sum.

She moved her brother out of a care home to live with her and her partner Steven Collins so the couple could easily access his money.

The pair spent the money on a new BMW Mini Cooper car along with several high performance motorbikes over the course of 15 months.

Their theft was discovered after they 
placed Vaughan into respite care so they could go away on holiday and 
staff noticed bruises on the 53-year-old’s body.

Police were called and an investigation revealed that Collins, also 53, had physically abused Vaughan.

The probe also uncovered the theft of his inheritance from his late mother Violet and that Martin had stolen £14,000 from her bank account before she died.

Martin, from Blandford, Dorset, was jailed for three years for theft while Collins was sentenced to four years in prison.

Judge Peter Johnson said: 'This was a despicable loss of control. You were living well beyond your means.

'You systematically plundered Vaughan’s bank account to the sum of £62,000 over approximately 15 months.

'Some of it was used to buy expensive motorbikes, and also a Mini Cooper.'

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the thefts started when Violet Martin was admitted to hospital after a fall in November 2011.

The couple seized the opportunity to steal £14,000 from her bank account and disguised it as a loan.

After she died and the inheritance had gone through, Martin and Collins removed Vaughan Martin from a care home to live in their house.

The couple denied charges of theft but were found guilty following a trial. Collins was also convicted of wilful neglect of a vulnerable person,

Lee Christmas, defending Martin, said the pair stole the money following a ‘loss of control out of despair.’

Nicholas Robinson, defending Collins, said: 'The shame of his conduct will be with him until the end of his days.'

A Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation hearing will be held at a later date to try and retrieve Vaughan Martin’s money.

Afterwards Detective Sergeant Paul Smith, of Dorset police, said: 'The charges follow a very protracted and difficult investigation, due predominately to the fact we could not interview either victim.

'Vaughan was a vulnerable adult, he couldn’t fend for himself.'
