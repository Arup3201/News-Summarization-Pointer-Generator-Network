Proving there is such a thing as a free lunch, for one day only a restaurant is offering diners the chance of a seafood feast for absolutely nothing.

But instead of your meal being cooked by experienced chefs, there will be eight mini cooks in charge of the kitchen.  

The young chefs from Saucy’s School of Fish will take over the kitchens of Soho-based Stephen St Kitchen restaurant on Thursday 19 February to whip up four fish dishes. 

Eight youngsters including Emily Runacres-Grundstrom, five, (left) and her brother Daniel, seven, (right) will be cooking four fish dishes on Thursday 19 February

The free lunch takes place from noon to 3pm at Stephen St Kitchen in Soho, London 

The idea comes from The Saucy Fish Co. which will be taking over Soho-based Stephen St Kitchen as part of its campaign to prove that cooking fish is child's play.

The eight primary school youngsters - whose ages range from between five to eight years old - will be getting their hands dirty in the kitchen cooking various types of fish including salmon, seabass, squid, king prawns and haddock. 

Chefs on the day will include seven-year-old Daniel Runacres-Grundstrom and his sister Emily, five, from West Sussex who will make their their way to London to cook up a storm in the kitchen. 

And as young as they may be, the siblings know their way around the kitchen and are keen helpers when it comes to mealtimes.

Salmon fillet with chilli, lime and ginger dressing, served with seasonal stir fried vegetables and noodles

Sea bass fillet with beurre blanc dressing, served with buttered new potatoes

Squid, king prawn and chorizo fused with a sherry and herb sauce, served with a crisp leaf salad, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and crusty bread

Smoked haddock with vintage cheddar cheese and chive sauce served with colcannon mash and petit pois

The siblings have been busy practising their meals before the big day, with Daniel claiming that the process wasn’t as difficult as he thought it would be.

‘It took me about five minutes. It was actually very easy. The only tricky bit was trying to separate the fish,’ he said.

The confident chef-to-be also said he is‘ looking forwards’ to cooking on Thursday

‘I want to be a chef,’ he said. ‘I like to cook and I like to help dad and mum do cooking.’

The fish fan counts sushi and fish and chips are his ‘first’ and ‘second’ favourite food’.

Sister Emily, five, is equally as excited. But unlike her brother, she has no ambitions to be a chef.

‘I am hoping I am going to be waitress,’ she said. ‘I quite want to be a waitress. I just want to see the people.'
