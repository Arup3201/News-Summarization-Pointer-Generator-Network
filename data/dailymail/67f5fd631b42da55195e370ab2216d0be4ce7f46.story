Boaz Myhill started his first Premier League for 10 months on Monday night after Ben Foster injured his calf in training.

It was not exactly a good omen for West Brom. His previous four league matches each ended in defeat.

Boaz Myhill was making his first appearance in the Premier League since December 2013 on Monday night

Myhill was beaten by Fellaini's excellent strike but did at least break his losing streak in the league

Stephane Sessegnon scored his first Premier League goal of the season - and it was an absolute belter. 

Registering at a shot speed of 62.1mph, Manchester United goalkeeper was left with no chance as West Brom burst into a surprise ninth minute lead. 

The goal came from a devastating move, which showed how quickly the Baggies can turn defence into attack.

It took just under 11 seconds for the home side to work the ball from Boaz Myhill's gloves to the back of David de Gea's net, as Andre Wisdom showed pace and vision to feed Stephane Sessegnon.

The Benin midfielder still had plenty to do when the ball reached him on the edge of the box, but his strike gave De Gea no chance. 

As opposed to Louis Van Gaal, who instructed his team to play a third different formation of the season, Alan Irvine stuck with the 5-2-3-1 system he has employed throughout this campaign. 

It was also the same outfield line-up that brought him wins against Tottenham and Burnley. 

Louis van Gaal's tactical adjustment saw United struggle, but his substitutions seemed to work

Van Gaal remained seated in the dugout the entire 90 minutes, while Irvine stood at the edge of his technical area.

Angel Di Maria has had a hand in seven goals in six Premier League appearances. His cross for Marouanne Fellaini’s goal last night was his fourth assist since joining, to go alongside three goals.

Angel di Maria was once again a threat for Manchester United, adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far

Adnan Januzaj was named in a Manchester United starting line-up for the first time in the Premier League this season and gave us a look at his new all-white boots. 

It looked as if he was playing in socks such was the colour and fabric of the boot, known as ‘Superheat soccer cleats’ made by Warrior. 

Januzaj's white 'Superheat soccer cleats' attracted plenty of attention during the game at The Hawthorns
