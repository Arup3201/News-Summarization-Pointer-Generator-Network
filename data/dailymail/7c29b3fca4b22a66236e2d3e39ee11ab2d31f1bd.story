These rusted and decaying railway tracks may seem like any of the thousands of feet of disused track that snake under midtown Manhattan.

But this discreet siding, Grand Central Terminal's 'Track 61' - was once a vital tool in the arsenal of wartime President Franklin D Roosevelt - and could yet spring into action again.

Hidden underneath the opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel, the secluded platform was one of many ways Roosevelt, stricken by polio and paralyzed from the waist down since 1921, would hide his affliction.

Secret siding: Pictured is Track 61 - a hidden portion of Grand Central Station - which functioned as a private way into the opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel for President Franklin D Roosevelt

Secluded: The underground passageway helped FDR avoid the press and public in a position where his paralysis might have been obvious. The exact location is kept a secret by the MTA

Secret: Roosevelt, pictured above on Presidential trains, was rarely pictured in a way that made his disability evident. Above, he is shown standing, but is supporting himself by holding on to railings

When visiting New York City, often from his childhood home in Hyde Park, upstate New York, the siding would allow him to make it to the Waldorf's Presidential suite without attracting public attention.

His private railway car - at that point still the luxury travel option of choice - was able to pull inside the station, at which point his limousine could drive straight off the carriage into an elevator connected directly to the hotel.

From here he could make it into his room where nobody could see him - particularly journalists who may have tried to break the veil of silence around his condition by taking pictures.

Though the media generally agreed to avoid mentioning Roosevelt's paralysis out of choice, the arrangement was not unbreachable.

Unfavorable outlets would on occasion draw attention to his illness, or publish pictures, much to the frustration of White House officials.

Escape route: According to a book about the legacy of Grand Central, the secret siding is still kept manned when the President visits the Astoria as it is a viable escape route

Secret: The MTA does not disclose exactly where the track runs. An official from the authority reportedly stumbled across the Secret Service in the tunnel during a 2003 visit by George W Bush

Armored: FDR's railway car, coated with thick steel and bullet-proof glass, continues to sit in the siding and is pictured above

In front of the crowds: In the above image, FDR addresses a crowd in the 1940s. Secret Service agents would smash cameras and ruin film which showed the President obviously incapable of walking

Photographers of the day told stories of Secret Service agents smashing their cameras or exposing film to sunlight 

Indeed, FDR's heavily-armored carriage, with bullet-proof glass and solid steel walls, still remains there to this day.

Judging from the photographs, it may seem like the functionality of the platform belongs to the distant past.

But the secluded siding is still ready to spring into action to save the president's life, and was reportedly on alert as recently as the Bush administration. 

Furtive: This staircase leads to an unknown part of the siding - and even photographs given access to Track 61 were not allowed down there

Grandeur: The opulent Waldorf Astoria, above, helped build the secret track for its highest-profile guests

According to Sam Roberts, the author of a book on Grand Central, a visit in 2003 by the chairman of the Metropolitan Transport Authority ended with a confrontation with Secret Service agents, who were guarding the track as a potential escape route.

In remarks from Grand Central: How a Train Station Transformed America, reported by Slate last year, chairman Peter Kalikow described the surprising encounter, which came as George W. Bush visited the Waldorf before addressing the United Nations.

He said that while exploring the tracks, 'several well-dressed, polite, but persuasively armed men in suits emerged from the underground shadows and stopped him.'

When an aide pointed out 'it's his railroad', the agent simply responded 'not today'. The book also reports that whenever a President stays in the Waldorf, a fully-manned diesel train also waits underneath in case he needs to escape an attack.
