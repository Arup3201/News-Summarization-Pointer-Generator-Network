A wife watched in horror as her husband died from an allergic reaction to an ingredient in her homemade curry.

Marcus Sweet, 46, returned from work to find his wife Julie preparing their evening meal, but after she gave him a small amount of the coconut cream she was using he began complaining of a sore throat, an inquest heard.

Mrs Sweet, 49, who had a daughter with her late husband, told the coroner: ‘He was looking a little bit clammy and a bit different.

Tragic: Marcus Sweet, 46, here with his wife, Julie and daughter Courtney, had an immediate reaction

Devastated: Julie, the wife of Marcus Sweet, 46, told Flax Bourton Coroner's Court he had eaten coconut before without reacting. But he collapsed when she gave him some coconut cream at their home in Bristol

'I told him he was starting to scare 
me. He said his throat was really sore and asked me to take him to 
hospital. I called an ambulance immediately.’

Fatal: Mr Sweet, a cleaning supervisor, was feeling fine when he came home from work earlier that day

But
despite a paramedic arriving at their home in Stapleton, near Bristol, 
within just four minutes, Mr Sweet suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

His
family accused Vic Ward, the first paramedic to attend, of failing to 
act to save Mr Sweet’s life during the incident in November 2011, 
claiming that he ‘just sat there’.

The paramedic admitted to the 
coroner: ‘This was possibly one of the worst incidents I have ever 
attended in my 30 years of work.

‘I think I was a bit like a rabbit in headlights. It was stretching the boundaries of my experience.’

The
inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard that when 
Mr Ward realised that Mr Sweet was having a reaction to the coconut 
cream, he treated it with  an antihistamine injection. But  minutes 
later, Mr Sweet went into anaphylactic shock – a potentially fatal 
extreme allergic reaction – clutching his throat and saying he could not
breathe.

Mrs Sweet said: ‘All of a sudden he just bolted upright, 
like a meerkat, and began to say he

While reactions to coconuts are relatively rare, an allergy to products derived from the tree nut is more common.

The reasons behind this vary from person to person.

Often, it is a case of cross-reactivity.

That
means the person is sensitive to a property present in a number of 
foods - coconut, milk, and duck eggs - that is highly concentrated when 
combined, for example in cream.

In other cases, the person is in fact reacting to a chemical in the product, not the coconut itself.

couldn’t breathe. He made a horrible
noise with his breathing, like a death rattle.

‘He was turning blue
and his face had swollen and his tongue was sticking out. I didn’t 
think he was going to recover. I looked at Vic Ward and just thought, 
“Do something, for goodness sakes do something”.’

The inquest heard that Mr Sweet had eaten coconut before but had not previously tried coconut cream.

Mr
Sweet’s mother-in-law, Josephine Needs, who also witnessed the death, 
told the inquest: ‘It was clear that Marcus wanted the paramedic’s help,
but the paramedic was by the window with his back to him. It looked 
like he was ignoring him.

‘Marcus didn’t look a good colour. He was clearly very, very unwell.’

The
inquest heard that Mr Sweet then fell off the sofa and went into a 
cardiac arrest. A short while later, another ambulance crew arrived who 
assisted Mr Ward with CPR, but after half an hour they pronounced Mr 
Sweet dead.

The inquest was also told that Mr Sweet suffered from an 
undiagnosed heart condition which may have been a contributory factor in
his death.

Recording a narrative verdict, which sets out the facts 
without attributing blame, Coroner Maria Voisin said: ‘Marcus Sweet 
suffered an allergic reaction. Paramedics were called, but despite 
treatment he died.’

Mrs Sweet yesterday criticised paramedic Mr Ward,
claiming he had ‘no sense of urgency at all’. She added: ‘I find it 
deeply worrying that he admitted he was out of his depth.’
