Looking like a cross between a Batmobile and a MP4-12C supercar, it is a car any man would be proud of - even Batman.

And legendary British sports-car maker, McLaren, has officially taken the wraps off its X-1, designed exclusively for an anonymous multi-millionaire.

The McLaren X-1 is inspired by a series of classic vehicles - including the 200mph MP4-12C - and even a grand piano.

Its owner wanted a one-off dream car - and it's like nothing else on the road.

He approached Woking-based McLaren with the brief that they should build him something 'timeless' and with 'classical elegance'. And this is what he got.

Unveiled with Batmobile wings: It took a three hour discussion with the firm and anonymous multi-millionaire to decide what the car would look like. Pages of notes were gathered and hundreds of images

A view from the front: Inspirational cars included a 1961 Facel Vega, a 1953 Chrysler D'Elegance Ghia, a 1959 Buick Electra, a 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroën SM

McLaren has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one-off car

A car built good enough for Batman? Anonymous car enthusiast wanted a car that reflected his needs and personality

After three-years of discussion, design and construction, McLaren unveiled the X-1 at the Pebble Beach Concours show in Monterey, California.

The supercar firm used the platform from its MP4-12C supercar for the X-1 - which means it has a 3.8-litre engine developing more than 600bhp.

With an MP4-12C costing in the region of £170,000 and the new exclusive X-1 wrapped in a unique body, which took two-and-a-half years to build - it is estimated the car is worth over a casual £1m.

The firm said it is the most ambitious example yet of their expertise.

It has a whole new body made of advanced 
materials.

Everything is bespoke, even down to the lights and wheels.

The X-1 had its own development programme because 
crucially, it wasn’t to be a concept car that would never see 
tarmac.

It was to be a usable car, road legal and capable of travelling
 at supercar speeds.

It used the 12C's engine and doors,but this is where the similarities ended after an incredible overhaul by Korean-born designer Hong Yeo.

The result is a car inspired by a 1961 Facel Vega, 1953 Chrysler D'Elegance Ghia, 1959 Buick Electra, 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroen SM.

On top of this, the X-1 takes design cues from a Jaeger LeCoultre art deco clock, an Airstream trailer, a Thomas Mann Montblanc pen, a grand piano, an eggplant and a black-and-white photo of Audrey Hepburn.

Paul MacKenzie, McLaren Special Operations programme director, said: 'One of our clients who already owned a McLaren F1, a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and now a 12C, wanted a unique car.

'The conversation began with our executive chairman Ron Dennis almost three years ago - before the 12C was even launched.

'The client wanted a machine that had all the capability of the 12C but wrapped in a unique body that reflected his needs and personality.'

Hong Yeo added: 'X-1 embodies the 
McLaren value that every part has to have a purpose. No details are 
simply visual cues, every one has a purpose.

'Although I like to think the wide 
body combined with pontoon style rear fenders will ensure the car glides
 when it's moving just like a superhero's cape.'

McLaren has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one-off car.

But rumours are circulating on the Internet that it was either Ralph Lauren or Jay Leno who opted for the model.

Both Americans are known car collectors with a fondness for McLarens and classic cars.

McLaren MP4-12C: The supercar can reach speeds up to 200mph and is worth £168,000

McLaren Automotive has been producing landmark sports car for the road for 20 years.

The McLaren F1 road car, which was launched in 1992, set the world land speed record for a production car, and is regarded as one of the iconic sports cars of the modern age.

The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is the most successful supercar ever in its price bracket, having sold twice as many cars as its nearest carbon-based rival.

McLaren X-1 is based structurally on the company’s carbon MonoCell but has a totally unique body.

The firm says it has been created for an 'anonymous car enthusiast.'

Programme Director Paul Mackenzie and
 Design Director Frank Stephenson went to see the anonymous client to 
start to explore the sort of car he wanted.

Frank Stephenson said: ‘The key qualities the client desired were "timeless and classical elegance".  Which was some challenge.’

Actress Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film, Breakfast at Tiffany's, inspired the X-1 car

The meeting with Mr Mackenzie and Mr Stephenson lasted for almost three hours.

From the pages of notes that were gathered, the design team brought together hundreds of images from the world of cars, architecture, fashion, design and even film.

These were then presented to the customer, and were then narrowed down to a mood book, full of inspiring images from which the design spirit of this unique car would be derived.

Inspirational cars included a 1961 Facel Vega, a 1953 Chrysler D’Elegance Ghia, a 1959 Buick Electra, a 1939 Mercedes-Benz 540K and a 1971 Citroën SM.

There were various examples of architecture – including the Guggenheim museums in New York and Bilbao – plus a Jaeger LeCoultre art deco clock, an Airstream trailer, a Thomas Mann Montblanc pen, a grand piano – and an eggplant.

‘The client liked the shiny texture of the finish,’ said Mr Stephenson. There was also a black-and-white photo of Audrey Hepburn.
