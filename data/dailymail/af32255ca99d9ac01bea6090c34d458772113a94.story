Police officers say their morale is being sapped by claims that they are thick, fat and lazy.

Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, attacked critics who, he says, believe officers are ‘fat, lazy blue-collar workers’.

He warned there was a danger that the beleaguered rank and file may even come to believe the myth, adding: ‘There’s only so much that you can take before you start thinking there may be some truth in it.’

Fighting fit: Police critics have been attacked for for describing officers as 'fat, lazy blue collar workers'

Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the 
Police Federation, said Government statements about police were 
destroying morale, asking: ‘Why would anybody feel good about being 
described as thick and lazy?’.

The comments, which were made at a 
major policing conference, will be seen as an attack on Tom Winsor, 
author of two reviews of police pay and conditions.

Mr Winsor wants compulsory fitness 
tests for all officers, instead of ad-hoc testing of those in specialist
roles. Those who cannot pass should have their pay docked and could be 
sacked.

The lawyer and former rail regulator, 
who spoke at the conference, said policing was wrongly seen as 
‘intellectually largely undemanding’.

Attack? The comments will be seen as an attack on Tom Winsor, whose appointment as Chief Inspector of the Constabulary has provoked fury from the Police Federation

He has recommended tougher entrance 
requirements to raise the standards of recruits, saying a career in 
policing should appeal to the ‘brightest and the best’.

The conference also heard criticism 
from senior officers over the proposed appointment of Mr Winsor to the 
role of Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Sir Hugh Orde, president of the 
Association of Chief Police Officers, told the Policing 2012 conference 
in Central London that Mr Winsor would not be able to give advice in a 
crisis, such as a terror attack, because he had not been in the force.

‘It is a historic moment in that it is
the first time that a non-sworn officer has been appointed to that role
in the history of policing in this country,’ Sir Hugh said.

He said that as chief constable in Northern Ireland he would ask the inspectorate for advice on issues such as terrorism.

But Sir Hugh added: ‘In the new model,
those are not the sort of issues I’d expect to ring Tom and his people 
about, because simply he’s the wrong person.’

Strong words: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said Mr Winsor would not be able to give advice on difficult operational decisions in a crisis, such as during a terrorist attack

The selection of Mr Winsor by Home 
Secretary Theresa May has angered the Police Federation, which sees his 
reports as an attack on police.

If his appointment is confirmed, he will be the first non-officer in the role in more than 150 years.

Mr Winsor told the conference: 
‘Policing has been unfairly regarded as an occupation of an 
intellectually largely undemanding nature, with more in common with 
blue-collar workers.

‘Policing today is entirely different.
The attitudes of some police officers remain fastened in that mindset 
and I believe that is holding them back.

‘If policing is to become the 
profession it should be, officers must come to think of themselves not 
as the blue-coated workers of the past but practitioners of a profession
which requires skills and attitudes distinctly above those of factory 
workers.’
