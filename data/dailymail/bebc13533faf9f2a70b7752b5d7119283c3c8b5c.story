It is not just in Pamplona, Spain that people take their life in their hands running alongside bulls.

It happens in America too where they have copied the festival in which runners flee down the street in front of the rampaging animals.

Justin Triplett took part in the event at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton, California and found himself trampled by a 2,000lb beast.

Mr Triplett was filming the event over his shoulder on his mobile as he ran when he underestimated the distance between him and the bull.

'I took my phone out to start recording backwards as I was running away,' Mr Triplett told the television station KPIX-TV. 'The next thing I remember is that the crowd that was behind me dispersed, and I looked back and realized the bull was probably 10, five yards away from me.'

Mr Triplett came to The Great Bull Run: He saw. He ran. Then he got trampled and ended up in hospital.

Ouch that's got to hut: the ball slams into Mr Triplett leaving him in a dazed heap on the floor

Then it speeded up and rammed into him, leaving him in a heap on the ground and the crowd gasping.

In a posting on Facebook later that day, Mr Triplett wrote, 'Nothing bad happened, just bad cuts on my face and right side. Thank you guys for all the support.'

As if being run over by a bull is not bad enough, Mr Triplett is now thinking about participating in the Tough Mudder, a gruelling 10- to 12-mile obstacle course that involves running through mud, icy water and fire.
