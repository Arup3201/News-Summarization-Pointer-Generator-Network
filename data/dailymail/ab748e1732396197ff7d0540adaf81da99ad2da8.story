A coastal village can now boast a new attraction - the country's smallest parking space.

The tiny gap in between two sets of double yellow lines measures in at just nine inches wide, just big enough to fit the wheels of a bicycle.

Residents of Burry Port, Carmarthenshire have now gone to town with the gaffe - mocking officials who left the space by parking toy cars in the spot.

Tiny: Locals in Burry Port, Wales have been left baffled by the tiny parking space, which measures in at just nine inches wide

Bus tour manager Emyr Phillips, who first noticed the gap two weeks ago, said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes when I spotted it. You could just about fit a bike in there sideways - or maybe a pogo stick.'

The 72-year-old added: 'But my favourite thing was to put a toy bus in there just to have a laugh at it.'

However, Carmarthshire Council bosses have revealed there is a real reason why workmen didn't fill in the space.

One set of yellow lines are on a public road owned by the local authority, while the others are on a private road which leads to the local GP surgery.

A spokesman explained: 'The section of double yellow lines leading to the surgery is on a private access road and the council would not have undertaken this work.

'It is likely the surgery would have arranged for the yellow markings to restrict parking on the access road.

'The break in the lines is required as this shows the termination of the traffic order on the public road.'

Carmarthenshire Council bosses have defended the move, insisting the yellow lines belong to both public and private roads

But villager Martin Thomas, who cheekily parked the plastic truck in the spot, has branded the explanation 'nonsense'.

He said: 'We all think it makes a lot more sense to have joined-up thinking - and joined up yellow lines. It really is bureaucratic nonsense.'
