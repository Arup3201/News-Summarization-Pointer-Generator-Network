Former vice president Dick Cheney has backed down from comments he made that Sarah Palin was not qualified to be a vice presidential candidate after he called her selection ‘a mistake’ by John McCain in a TV interview.

Cheney said his comments were aimed at the basic process that McCain used rather than an attack on Palin, the former Alaska governor.

His turn around came after a backlash to his comments on Palin’s suitability for the role in an interview on ABC News last week.

Palin a 'mistake': Former vice president Dick Cheney told ABC News that he Sarah Palin was a 'mistake' to pick her as a vice presidential candidate but days later said his comments were not an attack on her

He said: ‘'I like Governor Palin. I’ve met her. I know her.

'But based on her background, she’d only 
been governor for, what, two years? I don’t think she passed that test of 
being ready to take over and I think that was a mistake.’

Cheney told Fox News
 on Monday: 'My point basically dealt with the process in terms of that 
basic requirement: Is this person prepared to step in to be President of
 the United States when they’re picked?

Quick to respond: Palin was quick to hit back saying Cheney was listening to 'a false narrative over the last four years'

‘I was asked if I thought the McCain 
process in ‘08 had been well done or was it a mistake, and I said I 
thought it was a mistake.’

Palin was quick to hit back, making reference to an incident when Cheney accidentally shot his friend while quail hunting.

She said: ‘Seeing as how Dick, excuse me, Vice President Cheney, never misfires, then evidently he’s quite convinced that what he had evidently read about me by the lamestream media, having been written, what I believe is a false narrative over the last four years.’

McCain defended his decision to pick Palin saying he was 'proud of Sarah Palin'.

Even Cheney’s daughter also came to Palin’s defence, posting on Twitter: 'Rarely do I disagree with best VP ever but @SarahPalinUSA more qualified than Obama and Biden combined. Huge respect 4 all she's done 4 GOP.'

During the interview, Cheney was also quick to condemn President Barack Obama as a 'worse' president than Jimmy Carter.

He said: 'I obviously am not a big fan of President Obama. I think he’s been one of our weakest presidents.

'I just fundamentally disagree with him philosophically. I’d be hard put to find any Democratic president that I’ve disagreed with more.'

Condemned Obama too: During the ABC News interview, Cheney said Barack Obama was one of America's 'weakest presidents'
