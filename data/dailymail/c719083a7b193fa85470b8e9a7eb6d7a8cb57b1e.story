When Jose Mourinho answered a question about the new £5billion television contract on Wednesday evening, spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of Chelsea fans listening in.

‘When I was living in Italy and Spain I was paying about £200 a month to have the Premier League at my house,’ he said. ‘I think the Premier League is better when I am here.’

He really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters.

Sportsmail's team of reporters discuss whether Jose Mourinho's off-the-field antics are starting to harm his and the Premier League's reputations. Click HERE to read.

With that razor-sharp quip he walked out, heading back towards the manager’s office at Stamford Bridge to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute.

On Thursday night, when the FA announced that Branislav Ivanovic had escaped punishment for throttling Everton substitute James McCarthy and then laying his forehead on him, it was regarded by the club as a major victory.

They ignored the rationale, the television pictures that clearly showed referee Jonathan Moss on the scene when Ivanovic grabbed McCarthy round the neck after Gareth Barry had nobbled Willian.

The TV images showing Ivanovic’s head make contact with McCarthy’s left ear were inconclusive, according to a panel of three former referees. Because of that, Ivanovic has got off scot-free.

This literally is a fight for the title, with Chelsea happy to antagonise the FA, the opposition, officials, TV companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour.

Mourinho has everybody on the run and on Thursday it was the turn of the FA to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise Chelsea.

Since 2005, Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have been charged six times by the FA for incidents that were not seen by the match official. Manchester United, Stoke City and Chelsea have been charged four times. The idea that there is a vendetta is a myth.

Still, given Mourinho’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game, it would certainly help if the FA publicly clarified the position surrounding off-the-ball incidents. Confusion reigns.

When he was questioned about Gary Cahill’s off-the-ball kick in the back of Harry Kane at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Mourinho responded with a query about Raheem Sterling’s escape for raising his hands to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez.

On Tuesday, Mourinho highlighted the FA’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player (Robin van Persie) for the glance at James Tomkins before the Manchester United man elbowed him at Upton Park on Sunday.

From time to time, the Chelsea manager tosses in Arsene Wenger’s shove on him at Stamford Bridge on October 5, for which the Arsenal manager went unpunished. The memory plays tricks sometimes and Mourinho’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in 2007 after drawing 1-1 with Rosenborg.

We are close to revisiting that era, returning to a period when English football had earned a rest from the Chelsea manager.

Seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five-year deal, nothing has changed.

It is a sad day when the normally mild-mannered Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland is seen haranguing the fourth official, as he did repeatedly on Wednesday. With coaching assistant Rui Faria, who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague Silvino Louro in a bearhug after Willian’s dramatic 89th-minute winner, it is to be expected. Now Holland is at it as well.

In recent weeks, Chelsea’s technical area has become like the Dog & Duck at chucking out time. Someone needs to call time on it. What happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class?

What a shame because Chelsea have a brilliant team, seven points clear of Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and hurtling towards the title. At this rate it is in danger of being tainted.

Why should English football accept this yobbish, boorish behaviour on the touchline from one of the world’s super coaches and his increasingly aggressive assistants?

With the exception of Abramovich, there is no one on the Chelsea staff who is prepared to tell Mourinho to fall into line. There is no question who runs the show there.

Not only that, he is being allowed to run rings around English football.
