It’s when science fact meets science fiction. NASA's newest Near Earth Network Antenna looks just like the Forest Moon of Endor from Star Wars Return of the Jedi.

In a statement issued by the space agency, they say: ‘Our newest near Earth network antenna is operational, and no, it's not on Endor’.

This image of the two antennas from the space agency's Alaska facility suggests otherwise.

Reminiscent of the Forest Moon of Endor from Star Wars Return of the Jedi, NASA's newest Near Earth Network Antenna

For non-Star Wars aficionados, Endor is the home planet of the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi film. The sci-fi flick features a scene depicting similar communication dishes towering over a forest.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held yesterday near the base of the new NASA antenna within the Alaska Satellite Facility.

Operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, the facility is part of its ground-based network providing communication services for orbiting spacecraft.

Badri Younes, the deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation, said: ‘You call this area the final frontier’ and then to the gathered crowd he said: ‘At NASA, we see you as the first frontier because you are at the forefront of exploration.’
