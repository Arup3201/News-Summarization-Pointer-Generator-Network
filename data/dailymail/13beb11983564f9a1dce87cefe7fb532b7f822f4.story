Organisers have no intention of changing the dates of next year's African Cup of Nations even though hosts Morocco called for a postponement of the finals because of fears over the Ebola virus.

But the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said on Saturday it would meet the Moroccan government next month, sending a high-powered delegation to discuss the issue in Rabat led by its president Issa Hayatou.

The African Cup of Nations will go ahead next year say tournament organisers despite Ebola virus fears

The host nation's government made a shock announcement on Friday, saying it wanted the 16-team tournament from January 17-February 8 postponed following a report by its health ministry into the possible spread of the virus.

Last month the Moroccan government ordered a detailed report into the possibility that the tournament might spread the disease although no cases have yet been reported in the north African country.

Nigeria are the current champions after beating Burkino Faso 1-0 in the final courtesy of Sunday Mba's strike in the 2013 tournament held in South Africa.
