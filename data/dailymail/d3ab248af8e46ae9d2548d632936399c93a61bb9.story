After a month of threats from hackers that nearly derailed its release and almost brought Sony Pictures to its knees, the long-awaiting opening of The Interview on Christmas Day became a major event with packed crowds flocking to not only see the movie but also champion freedom of expression.

Hundreds of theaters, from The Edge 8 in Greenville, Alabama, to Michael Moore's Bijou by the Bay in Traverse City, Michigan,  made special holiday arrangements for the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

Sony Pictures had initially called off the release after major theater chains dropped the movie that was to have opened on as many as 3,000 screens.

But with President Obama among others criticizing the decision, Sony officials changed their minds and independent theaters agreed to release it in over 300 venues on Christmas Day.

'We are taking a stand for freedom,' said theater manager Lee Peterson of the Cinema Village East in Manhattan, where most of Thursday's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon. 

'We want to show the world that Americans will not be told what we can or cannot watch. Personally, I am not afraid.'

'It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,' said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. 'There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.'

Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it 'a funny film made by funny people.' He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: 'You have given this movie whole new lives.' 

At Atlanta's Plaza Theater, a sell-out crowd on Thursday hailed the film's release, washing down popcorn with beer and cocktails and uniting for a boisterous sing-along of God Bless America before the opening credits.

'This is way more fun than it would have been,' said Jim Kelley of Atlanta, who waited outside with his daughter, Shannon. The elder Kelley added, with mocking sarcasm, 'This is almost dangerous, like we're living life on the edge.' 

In Little Rock, members of an Arkansas family who say they otherwise would have never seen The Interview were among the first patrons at the Riverdale 10 theater. Kay Trice and her husband drove an hour from Stuttgart, Arkansas, to see the movie with their daughter and appreciated 'the freedom to see it.'

'It should be shown in this country and somebody in North Korea should not have the right to scare us out of seeing this,' Trice said.

Co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, who also co-stars in the low-brow comedy with James Franco, surprised moviegoers by appearing at the sold-out 12:30 a.m. PT (0330 ET) screening of the movie at a theater in Los Angeles, where they briefly thanked fans for their support.

A few dozen people lined up early outside Tempe, Arizona's Valley Art theater, where tickets for all five showings on Thursday had sold out. 'There are a lot of people going crazy over (the controversy). It's bigger than the movie,' said Omar Khiel, 20. 

At the Cinema Village theater in Manhattan, the 10 a.m. screening was near capacity. Derek Karpel, a 34-year-old attorney, said that 'as many people as possible should go see it. In fact, the government should subsidize tickets to make that possible.'

But he wasn't about to call The Interview a national treasure.

'No one should go into expecting it to be a serious commentary on politics,' he said. 'But it's fun. People should go.' 

The Interview also made history by becoming made available on a variety of digital platforms on Wednesday afternoon, including Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft's Xbox Video and a separate Sony website.

A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far, and the studio was not expected to have box office numbers from theaters before Friday morning.

'The Interview,' the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, was listed under an American flag on the marquee of the Cinefamily at Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles 

The back story of The Interview has itself played out like a Hollywood satire, in which a cartoonish farce distracts from some of the holiday season's most prestigious films: Selma, the drama about the 1965 civil rights march; Angelina Jolie's adaptation of the best-selling World War II story Unbroken; and the all-star, big-screen version of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods.

Security was light at many theaters, with the occasional police officer on hand. The possibility of violence was taken more seriously by the movie industry than by government officials. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that there were no credible threats.

Meanwhile, Darrell Foxworth, a special agent for the FBI in San Diego, said on Wednesday the agency was sharing information with independent movie theater owners showing The Interview out of 'an abundance of caution' and to educate them about cyber threats and what help the FBI can offer.

Kim Song, a North Korean diplomat to the United Nations, condemned the release on Wednesday, calling the movie an 'unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader.' But Kim said North Korea will likely limit its response to condemnation, with no 'physical reaction.' 

Decisions to show the movie through the internet could open up companies to hacking. Xbox and PlayStation's online gaming services were down on Thursday afternoon but the cause was unclear.

A hacking group called the Lizard Squad claimed it was behind disruptions at both Xbox and Sony Corp's PlayStation Networks, which was not carrying 'The Interview.'

Neither Microsoft nor Sony offered explanations for the connectivity problems, though both services expected heavy use as consumers who received the devices for Christmas tried to log on all at once.

Extra network traffic on Xbox from users downloading The Interview may also have exacerbated connectivity problems for Microsoft. Meanwhile, YouTube and other Google products were not having any disruptions.
