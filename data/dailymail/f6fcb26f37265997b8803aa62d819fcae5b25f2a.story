The lesbian waitress accused of falsely claiming a couple left her an offensive note instead of a tip has been fired.

Dayna Morales, 22, was let go from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, nearly a month after she made national headlines over what’s likely a hoax.

It comes just a few days after MailOnline exclusively revealed she had started paying back well-wishers who donated thousands of dollars to her.

Fired: Dayna Morales, 22, was let go from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, nearly a month after she made national headlines over what’s likely a hoax. Morales has begun refunding well-wishers who 
donated around $3,000 to her after hearing her outrageous tale

Pink slip: Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, issued a statement on Facebook to announce they had fired Danya Morales after the alleged hoax

The restaurant announced her termination on Facebook Saturday shortly after it was revealed she was returning donations from supporters across the world, according to the NY Post.

‘In light of … recent events, both Ms. Morales and Gallop Asian Bistro have made a joint decision that Ms. Morales will no longer continue her employment at our restaurant,’ the eatery wrote. “We wish her well in the future.'

The waitress had apparently doctored the receipt to make it look like they hadn't tipped her. The receipt allegedly said: ‘I’m sorry but I cannot tip because I don’t agree with your lifestyle and how you live your life.’

But
the former marine's story fell apart just days later when the couple 
came forward with their copy of the receipt showing an $18 tip.

Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55

Gallop
Asian Bistro’s Facebook post said it had ‘taken seriously the 
allegations made by Ms. Dayna Morales, and those made against her.

‘This is not a simple, straight-forward matter and we have conducted our own internal investigation.

The
results of that investigation are inconclusive as to exactly what 
happened between Ms. Morales and the customers that night.’

Former friends of hers have claimed 
she was a compulsive liar who had pretended she had terminal cancer and 
even that her father had raped her and killed her baby by throwing it 
down the stairs.

She 
even said she was the sole survivor of a bomb blast in Afghanistan. But 
it then transpired she had never seen action overseas and in fact had 
been dishonorably discharged.

Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a 
marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with
two small children, treated her while she served them but the family denied her claims

That was not before many who had been moved by her tale of prejudice stepped forward to donate money to her, which Morales had previously said she would give to LGBT charities and Wounded Warriors, a charity founded to help injured servicemen.

People started coming forward earlier this week to reveal she has in fact apparently seen the error of her ways and started to return the cash. Some estimates of her total haul were around $3,000.

It is not known if she has refunded the entirety of the cash.

Ann Farnum-Messano posted on Have A Gay Day's Facebook page - the same organization that advocates for tolerance that Morales used to first broadcast her tale of woe.

She said: 'I just got a refund from Dayna Morales. I hope she gets some help.' 

Disappointed: Well-wishers are happy that they have been refunded but also upset that the story was a 'hoax'

Another woman, Vivian S. Bedoya, posted that she too 'received a PayPal refund' and felt she had been taken for a terrible ride by the duping server. 

Michael Knote, founder of Ohio-based Have A Gay Day told MailOnline that he was disheartened but Dayna Morales' lowball tactics. 

'I feel let down,' he said. 'That someone would have the ability to just lie like this.

'I'm in a little disbelief that she didn't donate to the Wounded Warrior project, but I'm happy people are getting their money back.'

But for some of the people who came in-person to leave cash--the fate of that money remains in question. 

‘Some people dropped by cash,’ Gallop Asian Bistro co-owner said. ‘They come here and dropped a lot of money,’ Jack said. ‘I saw at least three or four people come here to give her cash and they will never come back.'
