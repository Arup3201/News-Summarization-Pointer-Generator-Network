Announcement: Theresa May, pictured appearing on television today, will reveal plans to recover powers from the EU in a speech this week

Britain is set to claw back 100 powers from the EU as the Government seeks an opt-out from controversial policies such as the European Arrest warrant.

The move represent the start of David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of the proposed in-out referendum on the EU.

But it is also a coup for Home Secretary Theresa May, who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada.

There are currently 133 EU regulations governing home affairs, justice and the police, including measures to set up a European DNA database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent.

In the next few days, Mrs May will tell MPs that the UK is to withdraw from all of the regulations before opting back in to some of them, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The process of opting out is governed by the controversial Lisbon Treaty, which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of EU policy.

The British Government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up.

It is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year.

One of the most contentious EU justice measures is the European Arrest Warrant, which allows any country to demand the arrest and deportation of a suspected criminal by another member state.

It is designed to stop offenders seeking refuge abroad, but British officials claim that slacker standards in other countries leave the system open to abuse and endanger UK citizens accused of crimes.

Britain deports far more suspects under 
the EAW than it receives, and there are concerns over the way that some 
countries hold suspects for months without putting them on trial.

Senior Conservatives are also keen to withdraw from a Europe-wide database of fingerprints and DNA profiles, and a plan to appoint a public prosecutor with the ability to investigate alleged wrongdoing in any member state.

The announcement of the new opt-outs is part of a plan to pacify Eurosceptic Tory back-benchers, who accuse Mr Cameron of being overly concerned with pleasing his Liberal Democrat coalition partners.

The Prime Minister has pledged to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay in the EU if the Conservatives win a majority at the next Election.

A call to enshrine the referendum promise into law was passed unanimously by MPs this week, with 304 in favour and none voting against.

Victory: Mrs May is riding high after the successful deportation of Muslim hate cleric Abu Qatada

The main beneficiary of the move to reclaim EU powers may be Mrs May, who is widely believed to hold leadership ambitions.

She is riding high after the deportation of Abu Qatada, who was flown to Jordan early this morning after a 10-year legal battle costing taxpayers as much as Â£2million.

The latest announcement will entrench her reputation as the darling of the Right, and the main rival to other leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

In the wake of the Abu Qatada affair, Mrs May has been installed by William Hill as the favourite to succeed Mr Cameron at the head of the Conservative Party, with odds of 4/1.
