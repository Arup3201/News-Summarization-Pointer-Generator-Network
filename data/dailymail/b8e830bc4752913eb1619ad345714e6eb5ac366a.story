He is the president of Sinn Fein, hailed by many for helping to cement the IRA’s ceasefire in 1994.

But one woman last night claimed Gerry Adams ‘betrayed’ Republicans, sanctioned the bombing of London targets and ordered the kidnapping of several people thought by the IRA to be traitors.

Convicted IRA bomber Dolours Price, 61, of Dublin, claims there is evidence of this in recordings which the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been trying to obtain from Boston College in the US.

The Massachusetts college made the tapes on the condition they would be kept secret until the 28 IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force terrorists who spoke had died, reported the Sunday Telegraph.

But then a book based on recordings of two dead terrorists revealed that former IRA commander Brendan Hughes mentioned the ‘disappeared’ - people killed by the IRA and buried in secret graves.

He made the allegation that high-profile female murder victim Jean McConville, who died in 1972, was killed by the ‘unknowns’ squad, claiming: ‘Gerry had control over this particular squad.’

Miss Price and her sister Marian joined the IRA in the 1970s. Her sister once claimed her miniskirt got her past British Army officials in a car full of explosives. They had a Republican family tradition.

‘My father used to sit us on his knee and tell us stories about how he'd gone off to war in 1939 at the age of 19 to bomb the English,’ Dolours Price told the Sunday Telegraph.

'He said: "If anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now through the back door at 10 minute intervals". The ones that were left were the ones that went'

She claimed to have told IRA commanders to target London - a plan presented to Mr Adams, who said, according to Miss Price, at a meeting to find volunteers, that it was a ‘big, dangerous operation’, adding: 'This could be a hanging job'.

‘He said: “If anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now through the back door at 10 minute intervals”,’ she claimed to the Sunday Telegraph. ‘The ones that were left were the ones that went.’

There was firstly a failed attempt to bomb Oxford Street - followed by four car bombs targeting the Old Bailey, an Army recruiting office in Westminster, New Scotland Yard and Whitehall.

The March 1973 bombing of the Old Bailey killed one and injured more than 200. Thirty-three were injured in Whitehall but the other two bombs were found before they exploded.

'I think the (peace) process should be undermined. I think the process should be destroyed in some way and I think Gerry Adams deserves to admit to his part, in all of the things that happened'

The Price sisters and their gang were arrested as they tried to get back to Ireland and were later jailed for life. Miss Price was freed eight years later in 1981 as she was suffering from an eating disorder.

Mr Adams, 63, said of her claims: ‘I reject again, as I have consistently rejected, the allegations.’

The PSNI believe Miss Price’s evidence 
could help solve the ‘disappeared’ murders. Now her latest quotes could yet damage the peace process. Mr Adams has always denied being in the 
IRA.

The US government 
has been working with the PSNI to get the tapes released, and has 
already won the case - although the college is waiting on a final attempt to have
their challenge heard in the US supreme court.

She
also claimed that Mr Adams was a key figure in the IRA during the early
1970s - and that he ordered her to drive alleged informers across the 
Ireland border, where they would be executed.

‘I
never knew for sure their ultimate end,’ she told the Sunday Telegraph.
‘I was simply told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of 
lads or whatever. Some I knew their fate, some I didn't.’

Miss Price added that people who are informers ‘deserve to die’ and ‘that is
the Republican way’. She said she gave interviews to Boston College to 
‘put Gerry Adams where he belonged’.

Miss Price claims to suffer from 
post-traumatic stress disorder and her sister is currently in prison 
hospital in Northern Ireland. But Miss Price still does not believe in the
peace process.

‘I think the process should be undermined,’ she said. ‘I think the process should be destroyed in some way and I think Gerry Adams deserves to admit to his part, in all of the things that happened.’
