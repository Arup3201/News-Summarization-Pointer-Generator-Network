Suffered: Incoming Governor of the Bank of England admitted efforts to revive Britain's ailing economy have made life hard for pensioners and savers

The incoming Governor of the Bank of England yesterday admitted efforts to revive Britain’s ailing economy have made life ‘extremely difficult’ for pensioners and savers.

Mark Carney, who takes up the post in July, acknowledged millions of prudent households have been hammered by record low interest rates, with the elderly among the hardest hit.

But the Canadian insisted that failure to take such drastic action to prop up the economy ‘would have harmed almost everybody – young and old, savers and borrowers, rich and poor’.

He spoke in his first public outing in Britain since his surprise appointment in November last year when George Osborne labelled him ‘the outstanding central banker of his generation’. Addressing MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney was also forced to defend his £874,000-a-year package, including an annual £250,000 housing allowance – a perk which he said made up for moving to London, one of the most expensive cities in the world. 

The 47-year-old banker, who will spend five years in the capital with his family, signalled a possible shift of emphasis away from controlling inflation towards promoting growth, revealing he has had ‘high-level’ talks with the Chancellor about a shake-up. 

The Bank has slashed rates to 0.5 per cent and pumped £375billion into the economy through quantitative easing, a policy which has been hugely controversial because it has driven down annuity rates which dictate how much a newly retired person receives from their pension.

Mr Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, said: ‘I absolutely recognise there are consequences from QE. Pensioners in this country are in difficult circumstances. But the responsibility of the Bank is the broad economy.’ 

The UK economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year – rounding off the worst four-year period outside the aftermath of war since the 1830s and leaving Britain on the brink of a  triple-dip recession.

Mr Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker, called for a review of the Bank’s remit but said he favoured sticking to an inflation target of 2 per cent – at least for now. It is thought he will pursue a more flexible approach, allowing inflation to stay above target for longer in order to bolster the economy.

He also warned the Bank could only do so much to revive the economy: ‘While the Bank’s actions  provide the cornerstones of British prosperity – price and financial  stability – these are necessary but not sufficient conditions for growth.’ 

Savers will continue to be punished by the worst interest rates in history as the Bank of England yesterday voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent, where it has been for nearly four years. It is the longest period of unchanged rates since the aftermath of the Second World War.

Hopes for economic recovery were boosted yesterday as figures revealed a sharp rise in factory output and exports.

Manufacturing rose 1.6 per cent in December, after a 0.3 per cent slump in November, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Exports also jumped 3 per cent in December, narrowing Britain’s trade deficit by £400million to £8.9billion.

Chris Williamson, of financial research group Markit, said: ‘Manufacturing and trade showed signs of renewed life in December, adding to indications that the UK economy gathered momentum.’
