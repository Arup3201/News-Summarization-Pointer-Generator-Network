These stunning flowers might look like they have been created using lace or delicately cut from paper but they are actually made from the skeletons of dead animals.

Sculptor Hideki Tokushige purchases rats and mice from pet shops in frozen batches that are normally used to feed reptiles.

He then defrosts the small creatures and cuts away the flesh until he has collected hundreds of miniscule bones.

Because of the delicate nature of the work it can often take up to a month to carefully dissect the small animals.

The beautiful yet gruesome flowers are then made by gluing each tiny fragment together until they resemble a recognisable bloom.

Hideki has created dozens of flowers including a lotus, spider lily, dandelion, and hydrangea.

The beautiful sculptures, photographed in black and white, look like they could have been created from lace or paper

He displays the delicate bone structures
at exhibitions for a limited period of time before breaking them up and
burying them in the ground.

Hideki, 38 from Tokyo in Japan said: 'The bones are from real mice and rats that are sold frozen in pet shops as feed.

'I am easily scared, more than ordinary people, and I am not good with horror movie as well.

A flower is made from around 100 mice bones and sometimes it takes more than a month to dissect one rodent

Tokushige said that he never whittles or alters the bone but only uses its natural shape to create his sculptures

'So I have feelings of resistance toward touching dead bodies at first. But as I treated them several times, I became to feel a familiarity with frozen mice.

'When my idea is fixed, I start to dissect. Then the construction part is started finally.

'My work starts from taking bones out. When making a flower, I always use around 100 mice bones and sometimes it takes over a month for only dissection.

Tokushige uses a skeleton to create this spidery image of a flower against a black background

He uses only real fur, skin, bones and glue so that the materials return to nature after they have been used up

The delicacy of Tokushige's work is emphasised by contrasting the white flower with a grey urban backdrop

'I often bring up the image of a flower from the bone's shape, I never whittle and manufacture bones, I just use the natural characteristics of the bone.

'I only use real bones, fur skin, and glue. Because for all stuff will be able to return to the earth. Bone flowers are pulled apart and put in the ground after shooting.

'I make flowers by changing various combinations of bones and I have made 11 kinds of flower like lotus, spider lily, dandelion, and hydrangea."
