Horrific footage has emerged of the moment a Sydney teenage girl is tackled to the ground by police and dragged in a headlock before she is knocked unconscious.

ABC's 7.30 program aired CCTV footage, showing Melissa Dunn with a group of her friends on a night out in January 2012.

The 16-year-old Aboriginal girl is chased by an officer after she punches a police van. She is then caught by her hair and arrested.

Melissa was charged with resisting and hindering police but was later found not guilty as the magistrate said officers had used an 'inordinate amount of force' in the arrest, the ABC reports.

But just three days after the trial in August 2012 the then 17-year-old committed suicide and now her mother says she will be taking legal action against NSW Police over her daughter's arrest.

It is believed Melissa was out celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of her arrest as police say several among the group were intoxicated.

The footage begins as the teenage girl punches a police van and storms off. 

When Melissa notices an officer coming after her, she makes a run for it but doesn't get very far as she is soon tackled to the ground.

A struggle ensues between the officer and Melissa before the teen is knocked unconscious when her head hits the gutter.

Police can be seen trying to drag her limp body into the back of a paddy wagon before trying to revive her.

The teenager's mother, Judy Timbery, told the ABC 'couldn't believe' how the police treated her daughter during the arrest and will be lodging a civil claim. 

'I was appalled,' she said.

'Seeing how he handled my daughter, we're supposed to trust the police, and when you see something like that, who can you trust?'

An internal police investigation later found the arrest of Melissa and her friend Noeleen Kane were unnecessary and that they should have been issued court attendance notices instead.

Ms Kane, who was 16 at the time, was arrested for swearing but was later released.

Redfern Legal Service lawyer David Porter told the ABC: 'the force used was not only unnecessary but the situation in which the police officer used force was created by himself failing to use his powers of arrest properly'.

Days after the trial ended, Melissa was found dead in a park in Maroubra, Sydney's south.

Her friends, who described Melissa as 'happy' and 'friendly', said she had an argument with her boyfriend before her tragic death.

Ms Timbery further told the ABC her daughter had a history of self-harm, alcohol and drugs.
