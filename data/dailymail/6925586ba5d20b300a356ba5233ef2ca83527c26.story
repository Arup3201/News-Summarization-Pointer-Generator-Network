Growing up to 40cm in length, super-sized goldfish are lurking in Western Australian waterways.

They are among the invasive feral fish of the Vasse River, south of Perth, with some growing to a massive 2kg after preying on native species.

A pet goldfish normally grows to about 5cm in length.

Dr Stephen Beatty holds up one of the goldfish that has spread to the Wilyabrup Brook that flows between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin near Perth.

One of the giant goldfish pulled from Perth's Vasse River. Some of them can measure up to 40cm and weigh 2kg

After being released into the wild by owners, the goldfish grow to super-size by gorging on native fish eggs and stir up algae blooms while they feed on the bottom of rivers.

It seems the mutant goldfish have also spread to the Wilyabrup Brook, near Busselton, in Western Australia.

But the brook is part of a different river system to the Vasse - the home of the world's fastest growing goldfish.

There are fears the fish could spread further with some highly tolerant of salt water.

A research fellow at Murdoch University's School of Veterinary and Life Sciences in Perth has helped to remove more than 1600 of the giant goldfish in the past decade and has been monitoring the growth rate of others.

The average size of a pet goldfish is about 5cm, eight times smaller than the giant ones found in the Vasse River

'They can grow up to 18cm in the first year, which is quite incredible,' Dr Stephen Beatty said.Â

The goldfish is just one of the feral fish species entering the south-west waterways where alien species are outnumbering local fish for the first time.

About 80 percent of the fish introduced into Vasse River are aquarium species, usually kept as pets, thought to be released by owners.

To track the movements of the goldfish, Dr Beatty and his colleagues implanted 21 of them with smaller replicas of acoustic tags normally used on great white sharks.

The team also installed listening posts along the river similar to the ones used to find out when the predator is near a beach.

It was part of a study they were doing last summer, the results of which will be published soon.

The scientists also found the fish's breeding ground was in a wetland part of the Vasse.

As part of their studies, Murdoch University scientists implanted 21 feral goldfish with smaller versions of tracking tags used on great white sharks

Goldfish normally live in freshwater.

Dr Beatty said the study was useful because it would help find preventative measures to keep alien species from crossing into other waterways.
