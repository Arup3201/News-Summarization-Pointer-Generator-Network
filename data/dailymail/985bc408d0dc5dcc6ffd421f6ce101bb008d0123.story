Lydia Rose Bright shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex as Lauren Goodger’s sidekick with a penchant for peroxide blonde hair extensions, fake tan and micro pigs.

But the former reality TV star insists that she’s left her TOWIE days far behind and is focusing on becoming a businesswoman and fashion designer.

After opening a clothes store, unveiling her eponymous fashion range and launching a YouTube channel, Lydia’s keen to position herself as a serious contender in the fashion and beauty world.

Her latest project sees her working as a brand ambassador for imPRESS nails and Kiss nail wraps, which she told MailOnline she ‘jumped at the chance’ to be involved with.Scroll down for video

New look: Lydia Bright, who found fame on TOWIE, says she has ditched her entire make-up bag from the show as she stars in a new nail campaign

Lydia says: ‘Statement nails have become such a massive thing and nail wraps are huge this year. I’ve always been a fan of having pristine nails so I was thrilled when they asked me to get on board.’

Lydia describes her personal look as ‘quite 50s and glamorous’ because she loves red nails, bold lips and cat-flick eyes.

Citing her all-time beauty heroine as Marilyn Monroe, Lydia insists that she has come a long way in the beauty stakes since she first graced our screens on TOWIE back in 2010.

‘I’ve ditched my whole make-up bag since then. When I was first on the show I used to use good products but applied them all wrong.

New gig: As well as working on her own fashion line, Lydia has just signed up to be an ambassador for imPRESS nails and Kiss nail wraps

‘My foundation was two shades darker than my skin tone; I used to use bronzer all over my face. I’ve ditched the really long lashes that were like spider eyes and I still use fake tan every now and then but not to the extent that I did on the show.

‘I think working in the industry and being alongside make-up artists and people in the know helps you pick up tricks,’ she said.

Lydia’s favourite products are MAC foundations, Urban Decay eye shadows and Shu Uemura eyelash curlers.

When it comes to budget beauty secrets, Lydia is a fan of the industry’s best kept secret: Vaseline to help her eyelashes grow.

The 23-year-old admits that her hectic lifestyle has taken its toll on her skin. 

Now and then: Lydia reveals that she has shaken up her beauty regime since TOWIE (r) and now champions the glamorous 50s look, swapping her blonde locks for a chic brunette 'do

‘I did a two-month tour with my store and I had major break-outs because I wasn’t sleeping that often and I was eating out a lot. I came back and it was awful.

‘I used 111 skin products to get rid of my spots and I love Rodial Snake Serum to tighten my face. I think skincare is something you should invest in,’ she said.

Lydia revealed that there are some famous faces she admires.

‘I am obsessed with Kim Kardashian’s look; she is amazing. I love Abbey Clancy too and Jessica Biel’s make-up always looks insane.’

Inbetween providing prom dress consultations in her Bella Sorella store and filming a series of beauty and fashion videos for her online YouTube channel, Lydia has been working on her clothing line.

Fashion forward: Lydia, 23, told MailOnline that River Island will be stocking her eponymous clothing line alongside Rihanna's designs

The budding designer is currently finalising her designs for the Lydia Rose Bright spring/summer 14 collection and has just secured River Island as a buyer, which will see her clothes sold alongside Rihanna’s.

She said: ‘Having River Island on board is so exciting, Rihanna's stuff is sold there so this is very cool for me. My range is also stocked on Asos and Very.co.uk so everything is going well.

‘Aside from fashion, I am working on my online presence and doing some presenting for Heart FM.

‘I am a busy bee but doing all the things that I love,' she added.
