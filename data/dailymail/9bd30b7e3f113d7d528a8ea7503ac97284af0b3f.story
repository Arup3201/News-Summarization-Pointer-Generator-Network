Wrong: The behaviour of the press during the search for Milly Dowler and their treatment of her parents was 'outrageous'

Having spent 16 months taking 'the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen', Lord Leveson has attacked the 'reckless' abuses of British newspapers.

People who found themselves in the public eye for reasons 'beyond their control' were treated as 'commodities', left with no rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect, he said.

The parents of Madeleine McCann and Milly Dowler were used as examples of people who had been abused most.

The News of the World received the fiercest criticism as the now-defunct tabloid had a general 'loss of direction' and 'lack of respect'.

'At the News of the World, quite apart from phone hacking, there was a failure of systems of management and compliance,' he wrote.

'None of the witnesses were able to identify who was responsible for ensuring compliance with an ethical approach to journalism and there was a general lack of respect for individual privacy and dignity.

'It was said that the News of the World had "lost its way" in relation to phone hacking; its casual attitude to privacy and the lip service it paid to consent demonstrated a far more general loss of direction.'

The judge also declared the Press Complaints Commission had 'failed' at keeping newspapers in line and protecting the public.

'There have been too many times when, chasing the story, parts of the press have acted as if its own code, which it wrote, simply did not exist. This has caused real hardship and, on occasion, wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained,' he said.

'This is not just the famous, but ordinary members of the public, caught up in events (many of them truly tragic) far larger than they could cope with but made much, much worse by press behaviour that, at times, can only be described as outrageous.

'Almost everyone accepts that the Press Complaints Commission has failed in the task, if indeed it ever saw itself as having such a task, of keeping the press to its responsibilities to the public generally, and to the individuals unfairly damaged. There must be change'.

Bob and Sally Dowler gave moving evidence to the inquiry about their treatment at the hands of the press following the disappearance of their daughter.

Disclosures that Milly’s phone was hacked by journalists and voicemails deleted - giving her parents 'false hope' that she was still alive - was the scandal that prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to launch the Leveson Inquiry.

'Mr and Mrs Dowler were subjected to intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress,' today’s report said.

But the report found that Mrs Dowler’s 'false hope moment' was unlikely to have been caused by journalists deleting or tampering with messages, but instead by the automatic deletion of messages.

'The fact remains that the NotW hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl called Milly Dowler,' he added.

The McCanns' rights to privacy, dignity or respect were 'trumped' by the interest in them, the report says.

'They were also treated as if they were a commodity in which the public, and by extension the press, had an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect.

The report added: 'If ever there were an example of a story which ran totally out of control, this is one'.

Statutory press regulation would not have 'prevented the horrors of the past', Lord Hunt said tonight as he reacted to Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations.

Delivering a lecture at the University of East Anglia, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) thanked Lord Justice Leveson for taking time 'to diagnose what has been seriously wrong in the world of newspapers and magazines'.

Acknowledging the 'unacceptable and outrageous behaviour' of a small minority of journalists, he said the report into press standards was 'impressive'.
