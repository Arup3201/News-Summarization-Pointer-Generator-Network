Painful: Captain Griffiths' father Brigadier Mike Griffiths talked emotionally about the death of his son

A Brigadier in the British Army has described receiving the 'dreaded knock on the door' to learn his soldier son being had been fatally wounded in Afghanistan.

Brig Mike Griffiths, the most senior serving officer to lose a child in the 11-year war, spoke of the heartbreaking moment ahead of a BBC3 documentary showing the young captain's final hours on the frontline.

The programme, Our War, will tonight broadcast harrowing scenes of two UK soldiers being severely injured while fighting insurgents in Helmand Province.

The uncensored footage was captured on
the helmet cameras of comrades during a daring three-day operation, 
codenamed Hornet's Nest, when troops were sent deep into enemy 
territory.

Captain Andrew Griffiths, 25, and 
Kingsman Darren Deady, 22 - both from Arnhem Company, 2nd Battalion Duke
of Lancaster's Regiment - suffered terrible injuries on the mission.

Both were flown home to the Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham but tragically died within weeks -  
Capt Griffiths on September 5, 2010, and Kingsman Deady just five days 
later - with their families at their bedsides.

In the programme, rarely-seen footage 
shows Capt Griffiths, a highly-respected young officer on his second 
tour of Afghanistan, a few moments before he stepped on a improvised 
explosive device (IED) that was buried in a disused mud-walled compound.

Since his son's death, Brig Griffiths 
has used his personal experience of grief to train and advise casualty 
notification officers whose job it is to break the news of deaths and 
injuries to Army families.

The 55-year-old, who commanded British
forces in Afghanistan and has seen men killed in action, said: 'We 
spoke to him on the Saturday as he was preparing to go out.

'Andrew said "We're going on another 
big one, and this could be really hard". He couldn't say any more, and 
he only told that to me. He wouldn't have told it to his mum.'

The next day, Capt Griffiths stepped 
on the deadly device in the Taliban stronghold of Nahr-e Saraj. Brig 
Griffith's boss went to their house to inform them of his injuries.

Brig Griffiths, the Army's Director 
Personnel Services, said: 'I was on leave when it happened. Sue, my 
wife, was about to go to work, and she was at the door when the doorbell
rang at 7.30. The door opened, and I looked over the stairs and I 
realised immediately what it was.

'You could see by the grim face that this wasn't good news. A normal day in the life of a family - and then it got shattered.'

He now emphasises to casualty 
notification officers the importance of their role and how vital it is 
to support grieving families.

'When a soldier is injured or, 
tragically, has died, their families need this rock around which they 
can cling in order to allow them either to grieve - and grieve properly -
and to understand,' he said.

'Or if they're wounded and making a recovery, to support them in that period because that's just as important.'

Brig Griffiths said the family missed 
the young man every day: 'I don't think the grief will ever go away. I 
think if he had survived his wounds, by now he'd have probably been 
running around challenging himself, because that's what he was like, and
that's what so many of these young men are like.

'I think you learn to cope with time. But you have waves of black grief, when I think it's extremely difficult to be positive.

'We are very lucky - we have three 
other children and they keep you going. And I am very lucky to have a 
wife who supports me as I support her. You never forget. I don't think 
there is a waking hour where I don't think and feel sad, but I know 
that's what everyone who goes through a loss does.

'The one thing we find most difficult 
is that we got Andrew back for 12 days. Broken and battered as he was, 
if he'd lived - with the support we would have given him - he would have
had a great life.'

The BBC was given fresh access to 
thousands of hours of footage shot by British soldiers in Helmand, 
showing some of the fiercest fighting, for the award-winning three-part 
series.

The images, show by the soldiers themselves, capture the chaos of war. They are not censored by the MoD.

In the film, Sergeant Mark Wilson 
described the incident that injured Capt Griffiths. He said: 'I remember
screaming for the boss. I was screaming boss that high that it sounded 
like a baby screaming.

'At first we didn’t realise that 
anything was wrong with him, I was shouting to him, I said "Boss are you
alright?", he was going "Yeah, I'm over here, I’m over here."

'It was then we realised that he was missing his lower part of his leg.'

At the time of his death, numerous colleagues left heartfelt tributes to Captain Griffiths.

Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd, Commanding Officer of 2 LANCS, said: 'Captain Andy Griffiths - or 'Griff' as my officers knew him - was an officer with courage, charm, values, humility and above all else a sense of fun. He played as hard as he fought in battle.

'He was a man who loved his regiment and respected his men and all reciprocated. He will never be forgotten because none of our close regimental family will ever be able to forget him.'

Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd added: 'His humility was his trademark when in uniform and the respect from his Lions - particularly his young Kingsmen - was genuinely the most impressive I have seen in a young officer in my twenty-four years in the infantry.

'In twelve months of deployments to central Helmand I have never seen so many soldiers requesting that their tributes be included as words that will follow my own.

'For myself it has been difficult to write my own words without fighting back a tear, I know that is also the case with my soldiers.

'A brother officer and a member of our very strong family regiment since he was a boy.

'In our regiment we have the unique honour of being 'Lions of England'. In our regiment Lions are led by Lions. Captain Andy Griffiths was one of our finest Lions. A leader of Lions, a Lion of a man.'

Earlier in the documentary, one 
shocking video being screened for the first time showed Kingsman Deady, 
from Bolton, after he was shot through the chest.

The tragic soldier, described by his 
colleagues as having 'the heart of a lion', is seen lying on the floor 
asking medics to 'hurry up' as they frantically try nine times to insert
a drip

Footage then showed a terrifying helicopter evacuation in a sandstorm.

Tragically Kingsman Deady later died on September 10 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Darren Deady, 22, left school at 16 
to join the Army and at the time of his death his family asked his 
bravery was not forgotten.

In a family statement, they said: 'At this moment we are experiencing the hardest times of our life.

'Darren was proud to do a job that he
loved and most of all believed in, his little brother once turned round
to him and asked him: "why do you fight?" and Darren simply replied; 
"To make a difference",' they said.

Colonel Boyd laid praise on Kingsmen 
Deady saying he had an 'irrepressible and infectious sense of humour' 
and his courage would always be remembered.

'He was always the first to volunteer
for everything, to carry the heaviest load or to be first in the patrol
to clear a path for his mates,' he said.

'He loved his job and his Regiment, he loved serving with his fellow Lions in Arnhem Company.'

Unique insight: The documentary will show footage, captured by the soldiers themselves, that have never before been seen by the public (stock image)

Shortly after his death, commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Boyd, Commanding Officer of 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said: 'Kingsman Darren Deady was a tiny man with the heart of a lion.

'His irrepressible and infectious sense of humour made this small man a huge character within Arnhem Company, where his courage and selflessness will always be remembered.

'He was always the first to volunteer for everything, to carry the heaviest load or to be first in the patrol to clear a path for his mates.

'No-one in my battalion was as good or as accurate with an underslung grenade launcher; he fired it time and again on two separate tours to protect the team he was ferociously loyal to. A team player, a man with a huge heart and a man with bags of humour in the face of adversity.'

The Our War series gives a searing 
insight into the horrors faced by British troops on the frontline, where
425 have died since the war began.

'Our War' will be broadcast on BBC Three at 9pm this evening.
