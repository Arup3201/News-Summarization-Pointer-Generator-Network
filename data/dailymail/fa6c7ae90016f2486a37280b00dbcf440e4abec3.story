A couple have been arrested after allegedly locking three of their adopted children in a bedroom and starving them - before enjoying a Thanksgiving feast downstairs with their biological son.

The alleged treatment at the hands of Larry and Nikki Russell was uncovered when their eldest adopted son escaped  at their Terre Haute, Indiana home on Friday after breaking a window.

Wandering barefoot and weighing just 93 
pounds, the 17-year-old boy was picked up by a motorist and taken to Union Hospital, 
where staff called police and the Department of Child Services.

He told officials the couple doused him and his adopted brothers in urine, bound them to their bed posts, locked them in pitch-black rooms and regularly left them without food and water.

Police found five children at the home ranging between 10 and 17 years old, the Indianapolis Star reported.

The teenager told officers that, while his adopted parents tucked into dinner alongside their son and another adopted child, three of the boys were left two microwave burritos and half a glass of water.

After their Thanksgiving feast, the parents allegedly bound the boy and smacked him across the face, leaving his nose and ear to bleed.

He also claimed they shoved balled up socks in his and his adopted brothers' mouths, which were then covered with duct tape.

In order to be considered to adopt in Indiana, would-be parents undergo a criminal background check and are fingerprinted for a federal background check. They are then linked with a social worker or a home study agency to undergo a home study. Finally, they complete 16 hours of training into 'birth family issues' and 'adoptive parenting'. To foster, they would undergo 10 hours of training.

The Indiana Department of Child 
Services said Larry and Nikki Russell had been cleared to become foster parents and adopted the four children earlier this year. They added they cannot comment specifically on the case but will help with the investigation.

One neighbouring parent, Kristi Cundiff, has eight adopted children.

'There are good case workers out there that do an awesome job and go above and beyond what they should be doing for children. And there're case workers that aren't so good,' she told News 10.

Cundiff said case workers are required to visit the home once a month when the children are in foster care. But visits are not required once the adoption is complete - and are only made when a concern of neglect is filed.

But he said the treatment was not an isolated incident; he claimed he and the other children were often doused with urine and left without food or water.

He said the couple tied him and two of the other adopted boys to their beds with duct tape and rope, and locked them inside the room, which had boarded-up windows and no light.

One boy told police about a horrific incident where Larry Russell allegedly forced another boy to apply IcyHot - a pain relieving heat rub cream - to his genitals and rectum.

Police said the alleged abuse apparently came as punishment for stealing food or bladder problems. In another occasion, the parents allegedly taped a 'pull-up' diaper to one of the boys.

During his interview with police, the teenager said he had escaped and planned to walk to the courthouse so he could get help.

'In my 19 years with the police force, I've never seen before what's been described by these children, the injuries they sustained and the condition in which they lived,' Assistant Police Chief Shawn Keen said at a press conference.

Larry Russell, 39, and Nikki Russell, 35, now face charges of child neglect and criminal confinement. They are being held in Vigo County Jail on $100,000 bond each.Â 

Terre Haute Detective Travis Chesshir said the couple acknowledged some of the boy's allegations, but denied others - and blamed much of the alleged abuse on each other.

Chesshir added that he saw abrasions on the teenager's wrists and ankles that seemed consistent with claims he had been tied to a bed. He also noted blood in the boy's nose and ear.

Investigators added that they found duct tape on the boys' beds, yellow rope and locks at the home.

DCS spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland confirmed the Russells had been foster parents and had adopted the children earlier this year. The children are now in the care of the state.

The couple will appear in Vigo Superir Court on Wednesday.
