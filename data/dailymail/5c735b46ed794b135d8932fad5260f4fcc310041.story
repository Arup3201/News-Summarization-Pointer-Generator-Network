When tensions run high in a football match, players' tempers can occasionally get the better of them.

But it seems the heat of the London derby between Chelsea and Arsenal got too much for managers Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho, who ended up shoving each other on the Stamford Bridge touchline within the first 20 minutes.

These pictures show the Frenchman approaching the Blues manager and pushing him in the chest after they disagreed over a tackle by Chelsea defender Gary Cahill on Alexis Sanchez.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger approached Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as he tried to remonstrate with fourth official Jon Moss during today's London derby

Fightback: Mourinho looks shocked by Wenger as decides to push back, as another member of the Chelsea coaching team rushes to intervene

Wenger's tie flaps in the wind as the two have a brief tiff during the first half of the Chelsea v Arsenal Premier League match this afternoon

Wenger pushed Mourinho square in the chest to stop him from remonstrating to fourth official Jon Moss.

Mourinho, known as The Special One, then reacts, pushing back aggressively and telling Wenger to 'back off' as Wenger's tie flaps in the wind.

Chelsea fans were seen cheering as Mr Moss and coaching staff stepped in to separate the pair of managers, while the players carried on unaware.

Referee Martin Atkinson was then called over to have words with the two managers, who, surprisingly, were not sent to the stands over the childish tiff. 

The bosses did not shake hands after the match, and they may yet find themselves in hot water with the FA for the clash after Mr Atkinson submits his match report. 

Mourinho could find himself in further trouble for walking on to the pitch to tell the referee that his Belgian goal keeper Thibaut Courtois was injured. 

When asked after the match about the clash with Wenger, the Chelsea boss said: 'For me, it is over. 

'But the technical area is very clear - I have mine, he has his and he cannot come to mine, especially to put pressure on the referee to give a red card to my player.

'So I just told him "leave my technical area and don't come back please".'

When asked if it was a big deal that Wenger had put his hands on him, Mourinho said: 'No, it is no problem.'

After the match, the Arsenal boss was asked whether he regretted the managers' long-running feud turning physical. He said: 'No. What is to regret after that?

'I wanted to go from A to B and somebody confronted me in between without any sign of welcome.'

It only took 20 minutes for the two managers, who have a long-running feud, to come to blows during the first half of the league clash

Football fans and celebrities on Twitter saw the funny side of the push-fight between the head coaches, including Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'A punch-up between the 2 managers at halftime would be sensational entertainment.'

He added: 'Even the 4th official is trying not to laugh.'

Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted: 'BOOM! Take him down, Arsene. #mourinho'. 

Matthew Taylor, a supporter from Chicago, said: 'I'm also having a good morning debating w/ my dad who'd win in a fight: Arsene Wenger or Jose Mourinho. I've got Wenger.' 

Chelsea fan Sammy Quaye tweeted: 'That Wenger - Mourinho fight must be arranged soon'.  

The Blues went on to win the match between the two-title contenders. Eden Hazard put Chelsea ahead in the first half from the penalty spot, with Diego Costa doubling their lead late on in the second half.

Wenger and Mourinho have a long-running feud which stretches back to when the former Real Madrid manager first came to the Premier League.

In footballing terms the Chelsea manager is on top, remaining unbeaten by Wenger in all competitions after 12 attempts.

In the summer of 2005, the outspoken Portuguese suggested the fixture list was arranged to favour Arsenal, and within a month Wenger was questioning Chelsea’s negative tactics. 

Later that year Wenger said Mourinho was 'disrepectful' and 'out of touch with reality' for calling him a voyeur who was obsessed with Chelsea.

Final warning: Referee Martin Atkinson was then called over to have words with the two managers, who, surprisingly, were not sent to the stands over the childish tiff

In February this year, Chelsea were one point clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table and the ceasefire between Wenger and Mourinho was shattered after the Arsenal manager suggested his opposite number was afraid of failure. 

In possibly their worst fall-out so far, Mourinho responded: ‘He’s a specialist in failure. If he is right and I am afraid of failure it is because I didn’t fail many times. Eight years without silverware, that’s failure.’ 

Their feud continued in in Wenger's 1000th game in March, when Mourinho's Blues side spoiled the occasion by thrashing them 6-0.

This summer saw the pair clash in the transfer market as former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas sought to return the Premier League after a spell with Barcelona.

Spanish international Fabregas chose Chelsea, moving for £30million.

Mourinho insisted that returning to the Emirates was ‘not an option’ because the Spaniard ‘really wanted to come to Chelsea’.

Wenger responded: ‘People came out and said he wanted to go to Chelsea but I don’t know who tells the truth here or not.’
