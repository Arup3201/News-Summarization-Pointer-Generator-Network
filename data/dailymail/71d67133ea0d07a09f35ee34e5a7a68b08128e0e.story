IAN LADYMAN: Chelsea star Mata set to complete £37m move to United on Friday

After such a miserable season, Manchester United fans have been crying out for a hero. In Juan Mata, they might just have one.

With confidence at an all-time low after the Sunderland defeat, Mata’s signing is a glimmer of hope at Old Trafford.

He’s a magician of a player, has a fantastic attitude and he can thread a pass through the eye of a needle. He’s a match-winner, but make no mistake, he’s not the answer to all of United’s problems.

His arrival is a statement of intent but it’s just papering over the cracks at the moment.

Waving goodbye: Juan Mata looks to be on his way from Chelsea to Manchester United

Needs more: It is a good start for David Moyes, but the signing is just papering over the cracks

United need an overhaul to get back to the top and they are still short of five or six top-quality players. With the likes of Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand all potentially leaving in the summer, it will be a big rebuilding project. But signing Mata is a good start.

When Robin van Persie joined, United had won nothing the previous year. He was the catalyst, the player who made the difference and fired them to the league title. Mata could have a similar impact and if he gets United into the top four, it will be just as big an achievement.

The problem for David Moyes is getting his players fit, because a team sheet with Van Persie, Mata, Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj on it starts to look very dangerous.

I’ve always said  lining up in the tunnel at Old Trafford was nerve-racking because of the number of superstars they had. They miss that aura now but with those four they’ll be able to hurt teams.

Dribbler: Mata has proved his quality at Chelsea, and now he can make United fearsome again

Link up: Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney have been crying out for a creative force behind them

Potential: Adnan Januzaj has burst onto the scene and could help Mata

Trophy after trophy: Teams used to be scared visiting United, Moyes needs to find a way to replicate this

People say he’s not a United player or doesn’t fit their philosophy but what is their current philosophy? Good players adapt and United can be flexible to get the best out of their attacking players.

They could easily go with a midfield diamond with Mata at the top of it behind Rooney and RVP, or he could play in a wider role. As long as Moyes restores his confidence he could play Mata anywhere across the front because he is expert at playing in between the lines.

In football we have very short memories. All it takes is a bad six months and suddenly you’re a bad player. That’s just not true with Mata. He played 64 games and scored 20 goals last season and was Chelsea’s Player of the Year, again. He has always been good enough for Chelsea, he was just never good enough for Jose Mourinho.

Failures: The current crop have suffered unacceptable cup defeats at home... amongst others

Window of opportunity: Robin van Persie arrives for training and United will hope to have him back soon

Not looking clever: Tom Cleverley arrives the day after the semi-final penalties defeat by Sunderland

Arrival: Nemanja Vidic, suspended for the Sunderland debacle, drives into the training ground

A tough gig: Ryan Giggs looks lees-than impressed as he arrives at Carrington

In the shadows: Marquee summer signing Marouane Fellaini is recovering from injury

Coach in the car: Phil Neville arrives for what surely will be a chastening day at training

Flops: Shinji Kagawa (left) and Alexander Buttner both played in the semi-final loss

Mourinho is the kind of  manager who can make you feel a million dollars, but equally he can suck the life out of you with just a few words.

That’s what happened with Mata this season. Clearly he didn’t fit the Mourinho mould and he looked totally drained.

That’s not to say Jose is wrong, it’s just his opinion and if Chelsea win the title, his decision will have been entirely vindicated.

But now Mata has a chance to play regular football again and he will want to impress.

It’s up to Moyes to put an arm round him and get him back to his best, because an on-song Juan Mata is the first step towards getting the fear factor back at Old Trafford.

Lacking confidence: Jose Mourinho not fancying Mata doesn't mean Chelsea didn't

No Juan there: Mata trained alone in Chelsea's fitness centre and away from the first team on Wednesday

Big decision: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is happy to let Spanish playmaker Juan Mata join Manchester United
