Winner: Melissa Ignasiak Smith, pictured, says she was 'harassed and treated poorly' by a battalion chief and other male firefighters at New Smyrna Beach Fire Department

A 35-year-old ex-firefighter has been awarded $440,000 after a jury found she was bullied and then sacked from a Florida fire station because she was a woman.

Melissa Ignasiak Smith says she was 'harassed and treated poorly' by a battalion chief and other male firefighters at New Smyrna Beach Fire Department who told her 'women should not be in the fire service.' When she complained, she was fired, she says.

After five days of testimony, a seven-woman, one-man Orlando jury took just two hours to decide that the mother-of-one suffered sexual harassment at the hands of lieutenants and chiefs within the Fire Department and was let go because she spoke out.

'There are no words to describe the vindication I feel,' Smith told The Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Smith's attorney William Amlong said the verdict 'was one more message from one more jury that fire and police departments can't act this way.'

Smith will get $444,000 in back wages and emotional distress damages and is also entitled to her job back or front pay, Amlong said.

Lawyers for the city of New Smyrna Beach said they will appeal the decision.

Smith, who now works as an emergency room nurse at Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach, said she tried for years to fix the discrimination within the department but city officials ignored her.

'I took it all the way up to (then City Manager John Hagood) and pleaded with them to fix it,' she told the newspaper. 'I tried and tried to fix this while working there.'

She said she also kept fighting to set a good example for her daughter.

'I also did this so my daughter can see there is still some positive out there and if you dig down deep enough and continue to fight, people will be held liable for the laws they violate,' she said.

The woman filed the lawsuit against the city in July 2011 after the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission threw out her complaint, stating that it failed to see any evidence of unfair dismissal based on gender.

According to the News-Journal, the city responded to the EEOC with a list of complaints about Smith.

They said she was tardy, argued with a superior, failed to call in sick and other matters that prompted written warnings and counseling.

Amlong said an appeal by the city could only be based on a judicial mistake and U.S. District Judge Roy B Dalton Jr. hadn't made any mistakes.
