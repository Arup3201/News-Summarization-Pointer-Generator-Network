'Don't they have any compassion?' I'm better off dead. I'd rather die.'

She continues: 'It’s not [the kids'] fault. I’m not the only one. It can happen to any child.'

'Some children decided to throw themselves into the sea, they’re dead now. They have killed our dreams, they have killed everything inside us. There’s nothing left. There is no upbringing. This is criminal, this is simply criminal.'

In the video filmed in a car, she explains why she does not want to leave her family home saying: 'I would have had no life, no education,' she says in the video.

The practice of marrying young girls 
is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights 
groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages.

Yemen's gripping poverty plays a role
 in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice, as poor families find 
themselves unable to say no to bride-prices in the hundreds of dollars 
for their daughters.

More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry.

Tribal custom also plays a role, 
including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient 
wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation.

In September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights organisation said.

Yemen once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter marries.

The video which can not be independently verified was filmed by the Middle East Media Research Institute - it finishes with her stating: 'I'm done with you, you ruined my dreams.'

The schoolgirl. one of eight children, was taken in by her  uncle Abdel Salam al-Ahdal, when she was aged three.

But when a  Yemeni expatriate living in
 Saudi Arabia asked her parents if he could marry her, they readily agreed.

In an interview with National Yemen, 
Nada accuses her mother of 
arranging the marriage for profit.

'But I'm not an item for sale,' she says.

'I'm a human being and I would rather die than get married at this age.'

Nada, has an 18-year-old sister who has already been engaged many times.

Her 
parents accepted each new proposal and took a partial down payment for a 
bride price.

They would then postpone the marriage until the groom had accumulated enough money before  ending the engagement and keeping the down payment.

Her uncle was horrified his young niece who lived with him, his son and his elderly mother was being married off.

He told NOW: 'When I heard about the groom, I panicked. Nada 
was not even 11 years old; she was exactly 10 years and 3 months. I 
could not allow her to be married off and have her future destroyed, 
especially since her aunt was forced to marry at 13 and burnt herself.

'I
 did all I could to prevent that marriage. I called the groom and told 
him Nada was no good for him. I told him she did not wear the veil and 
he asked if things were going to remain like that. I said ‘yes, and I 
agree because she chose it. I also told him that she liked singing and 
asked if he would remain engaged to her.'

Her parents were not happy the engagement was called off and demanded that Nada be returned home to them.

But following her return home,  Nada disappeared after her parents tried to marry her off again against her will.

When her uncle found her again, he informed authorities and Nada was eventually allowed to return to live with her uncle, her father's brother - she then posted the horrifying video online.
