Kyle Sinckler grew up a long way from the Twickenham Stoop. Not in geographical terms, but in almost every other sense.

Raised by single mum Donna, the football-loving youngster spent his childhood trying to steer clear of the pitfalls that can go with growing up on a tough south London housing estate.

The 21-year-old tighthead prop has made a name for himself this season and his reputation is growing beyond the Stoop, his club's home ground.

He is quick to praise the part his mother has played in his development and says his background has 'made me the person I am today'.

Sinckler explains: 'On the estate there was that sort of (gang-related) environment. But those guys respected me because they knew I was trying to be the best I could be with rugby and I just let them get on with whatever they were doing. 

'My mum always taught me to stay clear of trouble and surround myself with positive people. I worked hard, found a love for rugby and did my schoolwork to keep mum happy.'

The 19-stone Sinckler will be an integral part of Harlequins' bid to snatch the final Aviva  Premiership play-off place from Bath by beating them at home.

Indeed, Sinckler's star is rising so fast
 it is not beyond the realms of possibility that if any more of the 
England squad suffer injuries he could be on the plane to New Zealand 
for the summer tour.

'I'd be 
lying if I said I didn't want to play for England,' he said. 'That would
 be a massive honour. But my focus is on beating Bath. It's a massive 
game.'

This
 has been a breakthrough season for him. He has not just filled in for 
injury victims Paul Doran-Jones and Will Collier, but has excelled in a 
position where there are unparalleled physical and technical demands.

He has shown the ability to combine his strength — he can repeatedly bench press more than 165kg (26st) — with athleticism and excellent handling skills. He appears destined to play international rugby.

But it could all have been very different had Donna, who works at a police call centre, not taken him to local rugby club Battersea Ironsides when he was eight following complaints that her son's approach was too physical for football.

Saracens have clinched the regular-season title and a home semi-final.

Northampton need a point against Wasps to be sure of a home semi-final.

Leicester need a bonus point against Saracens to overtake Northampton if they don’t beat Wasps.

Winners of Harlequins v Bath get a play-off place.

Top six have qualified for the European Cup — Saracens, Northampton, Leicester, Bath, Harlequins, Sale.

Seventh-placed Wasps face a two-leg play off against Stade Francais for the last European place.

Worcester are relegated.

'I was a football fanatic but I kept being a bit too physical and probably getting sent off here and there,' he explains.

'My mum spoke to one of her friends who said she should take me down to the local rugby club to see if I liked it. I rocked up in my Manchester United shirt, played a game of touch and the rest is history.

'Rugby became a massive outlet for me to get my anger out. If I was angry, instead of doing something I shouldn't do I could go along to Battersea on a Sunday and do something within the laws. At the end we'd shake hands. There were no grudges.'

Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby, is certain Sinckler is one for the future, saying: 'You can't survive as a 21-year-old prop in the Premiership without an edge. Kyle has a lot of footballing ability and he's also got that edge. I like that. His potential is very high.'

On Saturday, Sinckler will be up against Bath's Welsh international Paul James with current England tight-head Dave Wilson on the other side. He is ready for the challenge.

'I hope they do come at me and underestimate me and then they can have a nice little surprise,' said Sinckler.

'I'm sure I'll get taught a few  lessons but that's what I want. I want to be playing against guys like Paul James and Davey Wilson instead of sitting at home watching it on TV. I want to be in the thick of it.

'You're a person of your environment. I'm glad that I'm where I am but I love where I came from. I'm a south London boy at heart.'
