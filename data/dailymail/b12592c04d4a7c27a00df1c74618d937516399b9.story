Are Liverpool right to stand by Luis Suarez?

Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has been charged with violent conduct after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in yesterday's 2-2 draw at Anfield.

The Uruguay international has until 6pm tomorrow to respond to the charge.

An FA statement read: 'The FA has charged Liverpool forward Luis Suarez with violent conduct.

'The charge follows an incident with Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic in yesterday’s fixture at Anfield.

'The incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed – click here for a video explanation of ‘not seen incidents’.

'It is alleged that the conduct of Suarez constitutes violent conduct and it is The FA’s contention that the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply is clearly insufficient in these circumstances - click here for a video explanation of "clearly insufficient punishment".

Stunned: Branislav Ivanovic couldn't believe Luis Saurez had attempted to bite him on the arm

'Suarez has until 6pm on Tuesday 23 
April to respond to the charge, thereafter an Independent Regulatory 
Commission will be convened this Wednesday, 24 April.'

Meanwhile, Ian Ayre has insisted 
Liverpool will stand by their man after he confirmed Suarez will not be 
sold this summer following the incident.

The club have acted swiftly in the 
aftermath of the inexplicable lunge at the Chelsea defender and, having 
released a series of statements last night, Ayre confirmed that the 
Uruguayan has been fined for his latest misdemeanour.

It has not been disclosed how much 
Suarez has been fined – it could range between two to four weeks’ wages,
which would equate to a figure between £200,000 to £400,000 – but he 
asked for the money to go to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

That
is the only action Liverpool are taking against Suarez – any suspension
will be handed down by the Football Association – and Ayre has made it 
clear they will work on improving the Uruguyan’s behaviour, even though 
there have been widespread calls for the club to offload him.

Speaking out: Prime Minister David Cameron said the FA need to take a hard line

Disbelief: The Chelsea defender didn't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by Suarez yesterday

Asked what action David Cameron 
thought should be taken against Suarez, the Prime Minister's official 
spokesman said: 'It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to 
consider.

'As part of 
their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they 
took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role 
models.'

When asked during an interview with 
the club’s in-house television station, LFC TV, whether events of the 
last 24 hours would have a bearing on Suarez’s future, Ayre replied: 
‘Not at all. It affects his future in the sense that we have to work 
with him on his discipline.

‘But Luis is a very important player 
to the club. He’s a very popular player with his teammates. As we keep 
saying, he signed a new four-year contract last summer and we’d all love
to see him here throughout that contract.

‘He’s a fantastic player, top scorer 
and everything we’d want in a striker, so there’s no change there. This 
is more about getting him back on the right track and it’s largely down 
to Brendan now to work with him on that side of his character.’

Ayre continued: ‘I think the most 
important thing is that we acted swiftly yesterday. Luis issued his 
apology and then we spoke with him last night and then again this 
morning. We’ve taken action to fine Luis for his actions.

‘Brendan (Rodgers) has spoken to him 
and I’ve spoken to him, and Brendan will be working with him further on 
his discipline. You can see when you speak to him how sorry he is about 
it and he’s certainly shown quite a lot of contrition to us.

‘As part of that, he’s also asked we 
donate the fine to the Hillsborough Family Support Group. I think he 
felt like he let a lot of people down yesterday. We’ll work with Luis – 
Brendan particularly – on this side of his character in his game.

‘Hopefully that puts the matter to 
rest from our point of view and we’ll wait and see if there’s any 
further action from the football authorities.’

Confrontation: The Chelsea star made no secret of his unhappiness over the incident with the Liverpool man

Asked what action David Cameron thought should be taken against Suarez, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider.

'As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models.'

Ayre – who cancelled a scheduled trip
to Australia and the Far East yesterday to take charge of the situation
– confirmed that Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, have been 
kept fully-informed throughout the process

‘With any incident like this, any 
major incident at the club, we’re in direct dialogue with the owners, 
always,’ said Ayre. ‘I spoke to them last night and they were happy with
the way we were handling the matter.’

Merseyside Police, meanwhile, has 
also issued a statement to confirm that officers from the force spoke 
with Ivanovic, who has subsequently accepted Suarez’s apology, last 
night.

It read: ‘Merseyside Police can 
confirm that following an incident at the Liverpool v Chelsea game 
yesterday (Sunday, 21 April 2013) officers have spoken to Branislav 
Ivanovic in person. He had no apparent physical injuries and did not 
wish to make a complaint.

‘This is now a matter for the Football Association.’

Suarez has himself moved quickly to apologise to Ivanovic and to the wider public.

Taking to Twitter on Sunday, he 
wrote: 'I am deeply sorry for my inexcusable behaviour earlier today 
during our match against Chelsea.  I have issued an apology and have 
tried to contact Branislav Ivanovic to speak to him personally. I 
apologise also to my manager, playing colleagues and everyone at  
Liverpool Football Club for letting them down.'

Repeat? The PSV star was as perplexed as Ivanovic by Suarez's behaviour

But despite the apology, Suarez continues to be attacked from all angles.

In an unusual step, sportswear giant adidas, who provide boots to the player, released a statement criticising the player.

They said: 'Adidas takes this type of
incident very seriously and does not condone Luis Suarez’s behaviour. 
We will be reminding him of the standards we expect from our players. 
Luis has admitted his actions were unacceptable and we support the way 
Liverpool are planning to handle the situation.'

Suarez has a history of shocking 
behaviour and was banned for seven matches in November 2011 after he bit
PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal when playing for Ajax.

He was dubbed ‘the Cannibal of Ajax’ by Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.

Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser.

Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward.

February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent.

November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque.

July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties.

November 2010: Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match.

October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off.

October 2011: Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000.

December 2011: Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture.

February 2012: United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off.

October 2012: Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game.

January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third round tie at Mansfield.

April 2013: Appears to bite Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield.
