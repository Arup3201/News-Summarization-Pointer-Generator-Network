Apple has joined the likes of Facebook and Google by releasing figures showing how many times governments around the world have requested personal information about its customers.

From 1 January to 30 June this year there were almost 3,000 data requests made from 31 countries - with the U.S and UK topping the list. 

Apple said the most common requests related to ‘robberies and other crimes’, requests from law enforcement agencies searching for missing people or hoping to prevent a suicide, and data about the owners of lost or stolen phones.

From 1 January to 30 June this year there were almost 3,000 data requests made from 31 countries. This table shows the countries that requested data, listed in alphabetical order. The U.S has forbidden Apple from declaring exact figures, but the tech giant said it received up to 2,000 requests across various states

1. U.S - between 1,000 and 2,000 requests about 2,000 to 3,000 accounts

2. UK - 127 requests about 141 accounts. Amount granted: 37 per cent

3. Spain - 102 requests about 104 accounts. Amount granted: 22 per cent

4. Germany - 93 requests about 93 accounts. Amount granted: 6 per cent

5. Australia - 74 requests about 75 accounts. Amount granted: 54 per cent

6. France - 71 requests about 72 accounts. Amount granted: 24 per cent

7. Italy - 60 requests about 72 accounts. Amount granted: 37 per cent

8. Japan - 42 requests about 49 accounts. Amount granted: 24 per cent

9. Hong Kong - 32 requests about 33 accounts. Amount granted: 75 per cent

10. Singapore - 23 requests about 23 accounts. Amount granted: 57 per cent

The firms said it assesses every data request it receives ‘carefully’ and did not grant all requests for information it received in the first half of this year.

The U.S has forbidden Apple from declaring exact figures, but the California-based tech giant said it received between 1,000 and 2,000 requests from law enforcements across various states. It granted between zero and 1,000 of these requests. 

The UK made 127 requests for personal information concerning a total of 141 accounts. Only 37 per cent of these were granted. 

Third place went to Spain with 102 requests made about 104 accounts, with 22 per cent of these granted. 

Surprisingly, Germany – renowned for its strong stance on privacy – was in fourth place asking for information about 93 accounts and receiving data on six per cent. 

According to the report, responding to an account request usually involved providing information about an account holder’s iTunes or iCloud account, such as a name and address. 

Apple said in very rare cases it was asked to provide stored photos or email and considered each request on a case-by-case basis.

Apple said the most common requests for personal data on devices, such as the phone pictured, related to 'robberies and other crimes', requests from law enforcement agencies searching for missing people or hoping to prevent a suicide, as well as data about the owners of lost or stolen phones

Country    No. requests  Granted

U.S            21,000               79 per cent

India          4,144                 50 per cent

UK             2,337                 69 per cent

Germany   2,068                 37 per cent

France     1,598                  39 per cent

Countries not featured in the report have not not made any requests to Apple for personal customer information.

Apple, along with other technology companies, is only allowed to report data request numbers in increments of 1,000 in the U.S.

The figures must also be a mixture of law enforcement and national security requests, making it impossible to know exactly how many are security-related.

The company registered its opposition to these rules earlier this week: ‘We feel strongly that the government should lift the gag order and permit companies to disclose complete and accurate numbers regarding FISA (Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act) requests and National Security Letters,’ Apple said in its report. 'We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent.’

Tech companies are keen to push for, or at least be seen to be pushing for, transparency in their dealings with U.S. intelligence agencies.

Facebook published its first 
Transparency Report in August which revealed the amount of requests 
similarly made by governments for the personal information of its users 
during the first half of this year.

Like with the Apple report, the U.S 
government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, 
while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain 
came in third with 2,337 requests.

However,
 not all of these requests were granted; Facebook handed over 
information in only 79 per cent of U.S requests, half of India's 
requests and 69 per cent of the demands from the UK.

The
 report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about 
its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries,
 the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the 
percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to 
disclose at least some data.

A study by Big Brother Watch found 70
 per cent of UK adults say British companies should publish reports on 
how often they receive requests for customer data from the police and 
security services.

While 66 per cent of British adults want the government to publish more data about how surveillance powers are used.

The research, carried out by ComRes 
on behalf of the privacy website, said companies like BT, Sky, 
Vodafone and EE should publish data about how many requests they receive in the same way Google, Microsoft
 and Facebook do.

Last year more than 570,000 data 
requests were made - up 15 per cent from 2011 - by the police, security 
services, HMRC and other public bodies. 

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother
 Watch, said: 'Transparency is an essential part of ensuring 
surveillance powers are not abused. Much more information could be 
published without any risk to security.

'British companies are not bound by 
secrecy laws from disclosing how many data requests they receive and 
they should follow the lead of companies like Microsoft and Google in 
publishing basic information about how many times they hand over 
customer data.'
