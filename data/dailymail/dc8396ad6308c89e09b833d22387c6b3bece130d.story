These are the last pictures ever taken of Formula One driver Maria de Villota before she was found dead in a Seville hotel room just 15 months after she lost an eye in a horror crash.

Spanish police have said her body was discovered in the Hotel Sevilla Congresos this morning and she had died 'apparently from natural causes.'

An autopsy is due to be carried out on the 33-year-old today, but local media are reporting she died of a suspected heart attack, while the Health and Saftey Executive have said links between the injuries she sustained in the crash and her death will be investigated.

The photographs, taken on September 21, show the tenacious sportswoman out jogging in Santander accompanied by her husband Rodrigo Garcia. The couple married just months before.

The Spanish driver had been due to speak at conference 
today in Seville titled What Really Matters, and her book Life Is A Gift was due to be released on Monday.

A
statement released by her family read: 'Dear friends, Maria has left 
us. She has had to go to heaven like all angels. We are thankful to God 
for the extra year and a half she gave us.'

Passionate: Taken on September 21, Maria de Villota retained her lust for life, say those who knew her

United: She was accompanied on her jog through the park by her husband and the couple's pet dog

Sources close to the case said they 
thought the post-mortem would reveal she had died of a heart attack, 
possibly linked to injuries she suffered as a result of her crash last 
year.

A spokesman for Spain's National Police in Seville, said: 'Everything is
pointing to Maria's death being the result of natural causes.

'Officers found no suspicious substances or medicines in her room and 
there were no signs of violence either in the room or on her body.

'The post-mortem has yet to take place but there is nothing at this stage to indicate a violent death or suicide.'

Alfonso Jimenez, Director of Spain's Young Sport Foundation, revealed 
Maria had sent him an email at midnight - around seven hours before she 
was found dead - asking him to come to the launch of her book next week.

He said: 'I read the email, went to bed and woke up this morning to discover she was dead. I'm in total shock.

'There was no one with more desire for life than Maria de Villota.'

Maria's parents Isabel and Emilio and husband Rodrigo took a morning 
train to Seville from their home in Madrid as soon as they discovered 
the news.

They arrived just after midday in the city and were photographed as they
entered the Forensic Institute of Forensic Medicine where the post-mortem was due to take place.

They declined to make any comment. Isabel, wearing dark glasses to hide her grief, held hands with Maria's husband.

Spanish media are now reporting that de Villota may have died of a heart attack

Maria's cousin, Nacho de Villota, said: 'We are totally stunned. This is something no-one was expecting.

'Maria was so happy in life we all saw it. Her dad called me this morning to tell me what had happened.

'I thank God we have been able to enjoy for one year and three months 
more after the accident a person who infused us with her happiness every
day.'

Fellow professionals have already started paying tributes to the popular racing driver.

Moments
after climbing from the cockpit of his Ferrari after the second 
practice session for this Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix, fellow Spaniard 
Fernando Alonso said: ‘I had just taken off my crash helmet when they 
told me.

'I don’t know what to say. Pray for her,
for her family and for the whole motorsport family. She was loved by 
everybody. I don’t really know what to say.’

Formula One officials and drivers at the Japanese Grand Prix were stunned by her death.

FIA president Jean Todt said: 'My deepest condolences go to the De Villota family.

'Maria was a fantastic driver, a leading light for women in motorsport and a tireless campaigner for road safety. Above all she was a friend I deeply admired.'

McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh said as the chairman of the Formula One Teams' Association: 'She was an inspiration not just to women in this sport, but also to all those who suffered life-threatening injuries.'

Sauber's Monisha Kaltenhorn, the first female team principal in the sport, said: 'If anybody represented strength and optimism, it was Maria. Her sudden death is a big loss to the motorsport world.'

Williams development driver Susie Wolff recalled how De Villota asked her to carry on for her and all women drivers following her accident.

'She very much said to me after it it's up to you to go out there and show them that it (a woman driver in Formula One) is possible.

'She knew that women could compete at that level and that's why, after her accident and her not being able to do that anymore, she just wanted someone to know it was possible.

A statement from Marussia added: 'It is with great sadness that we learned a short time ago of the news that Maria de Villota has passed away.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Maria's family and friends at this very difficult time.' 

De Villota's near fatal accident in July 2012 occurred while she was driving an Formula One car for only the fourth time, and the first for Marussia.

She was travelling at between 30 and 40mph when she hit a support truck during a straight-line exercise near an airfield in England. An internal team investigation concluded the car was not at fault.

De Villota lost her right eye as a result and required multiple operations to repair the damage to her face and skull.

Her death comes when De Villota seemed to be moving past her accident.

In
October last year she gave her first interview to Spanish 
magazine Hola, the accompanying pictures revealing the remarkable 
recovery she had made from her injuries.

She told Hola magazine in February she felt 'free' and 'back to being me' after returning to driving on normal roads.

De Villota was the guest honour at this year's Spanish Grand Prix.

She
had recently been publicising the book chronicling her life entitled Life Is A Gift.

Aside from other speaking 
engagements she had also recently taken up a role as FIA Women in 
Motorsport Ambassador for the governing body.

described as 'loved by everybody'

She married 29-year-old personal 
trainer Rodrigo Garcia Millan in July of this year. Her father was 
former Formula One driver Emilio de Villota.

Prior to being handed the chance with
Marussia, De Villota had raced in diverse motorsport categories such as
Spanish Formula Three and the World Touring Car Championship.

She had also taken part in the prestigious Daytona 24 hour race in the USA.

Stuart Ross, the neurosurgeon who treated Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond after his crash, theorises de Villota may have died of a seizure

Maria de Villota could have died following a seizure provoked by her head injury, the medic who treated Top Gear's Richard Hammond said today.

Consultant neurosurgeon Stuart Ross said the Spaniard's freak accident in July last year may have left her with epilepsy.

This could have led to her death in a hotel room more than a year after the crash.

'The only obvious connection I can see between the injury and her death is that she could have developed seizures after her head injury and she happened to have a big seizure in the hotel room,' he said.

'After a knock on the head or any brain injury, there's a possibility of developing epilepsy.

'That could happen 14 months down the line, even if she had not had a seizure in the interim.'

Mr Ross led the team that cared for Hammond at Leeds General Infirmary following the high speed crash in a jet-powered dragster that nearly claimed his life in 2006.

Doctors have yet to confirm how De Villota died.

But the neurosurgeon, a senior lecturer at the University of Leeds, said epilepsy was the most likely cause - if her death was related to her accident.

'Anyone with epilepsy has a small background risk of sudden death,' he added.

'It's a phenomenon that doesn't happen very often but it seems to be the most likely connection - if there is one - between what has happened and her (de Villota's) injury.'

A fit may have been brought on by flickering lights of a television or a simple infection or illness, he said.

Other possible catalysts for a seizure include failure to take medication if a patient is receiving treatment for the condition, he said.
