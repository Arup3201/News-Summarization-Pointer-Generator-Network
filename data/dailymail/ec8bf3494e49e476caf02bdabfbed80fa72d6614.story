Mark Sanford has reached a new low in his effort to reignite his congressional campaign as he debated a cardboard cut-out of Democrat Nancy Pelosi.

The stunt was meant as a jab at his competitor Elizabeth Colbert Busch who has received a sizable portion of her campaign funds from the Political Action Committee run by House Minority Leader Pelosi.

'My opponent continues to run a stealth campaign, avoiding public appearances and refusing to commit to televised forums for the benefit of 1st district voters,' the former South Carolina governor said to the cardboard poster of Mrs Pelosi.

Stunt: Mark Sanford resorted to hosting a 'debate' with Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who he credits for largely funding his Democratic competitor's campaign

Different tact: The disgraced former governor is trying to win back votes fast as the election is in less than two weeks

Mr Sanford, who infamously got tied up in ethics charges after his extramarital affair with an Argentinian journalist was discovered following his fake trip 'hiking the Appalachian trial' in 2009, is trailing Mrs Colbert Busch by nine points in the latest poll.

He claimed that since Mrs Colbert Busch has only agreed to one debate, which is scheduled for next Monday, she is trying to avoid him and hiding behind quick-spending Democrats like Mrs Pelosi.

As a result, he took aim at the largely unpopular former Speaker of the House rather than the lesser-known Mrs Colbert Busch, whose biggest endorsement arguably came from her comedian brother Stephen Colbert.

During the awkward press conference on Wednesday, Mr Sanford addressed each issue by saying 'my question for you, Nancy' and quipping 'she's not going to answer that one'.

'Context matters': Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford told MailOnline that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election

In the lead: Elizabeth Colbert Busch is up by nine points in the latest tracking polls, which comes as a shock as she is a Democrat in a heavily Republican district

Mrs Colbert Busch's team responded with a statement: 'While Mark Sanford continues his desperate campaign to deceive voters, Elizabeth Colbert Busch is spending her time with real people who support her campaign.'

Last-ditch effort: Sanford's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election

'She doesn’t have to resort to phony 
cardboard cut-outs to talk with the people of South Carolina,' Colbert 
Busch's spokesman James Smith said.

Even though the first congressional district in South Carolina is a heavily Republican one, last week was a tumultuous one of the campaign.

His ex-wife Jenny Sanford filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he broke the terms of their divorce by going into her Sullivans’ Island home without her permission.

He then took out a full page ad in the local newspaper over the weekend explaining that he did in fact go into her home in early February, but it was because he didn't want their 14-year-old son to watch the second half of the Super Bowl alone.

As an especially desperate measure, he even listed his cell phone number in the ad, and MailOnline spoke to him directly when he picked up.

'I think that people always want to know the real story, the full story,' he told MailOnline by phone.

The first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the court documents that Jenny Sanford's legal team filed, saying that he was seen leaving the back door of her Sullivans’ Island home using his cell phone as a flashlight.

'That's a rather spooky story- it would creep anybody out,' he said.

Among those who were spooked were the National Republican Congressional Committee, who pulled their funding from the race following the news of the lawsuit.

That wasn't the end of the bad news for the former Governor, however, as his ex-wife confirmed reports that his primary victory party was the first time that their 14-year-old son had met his mistress-turned-fiancée Maria Belen Chapur.

Awkward: Mark Sanford's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father's mistress-turned-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, a woman he had met for the first time just moments before

When asked by MailOnline if the public venue was really the first time that his son had met his future stepmother, he said: 'one of them had and one of them hadn't'.

'That's the nature of a surprise- I didn't know she was coming,' he said of his fiancée Maria Belen Chapur.

The race ends in less than two weeks when the special election is held on Tuesday May 7.
