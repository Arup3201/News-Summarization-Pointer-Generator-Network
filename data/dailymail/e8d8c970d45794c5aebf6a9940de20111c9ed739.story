With swathes of dense mist obscuring the sun, these gloomy skies were enough to send all but the earliest of birds diving back under the duvet.

Within hours, however, the blanket of fog thousands woke up to yesterday had burned away – leaving behind the hottest day of the year.

Temperatures reached 19c (66f) in Gravesend, Kent, with 17.6c (63.7f) at Santon  Downham in Suffolk and 17.1c (62.8f) in central London.

Thousands of commuters grappled with  
visibility as low as 50 metres on the way to work, but by lunchtime it 
had given way to glorious sunshine.

So while this woman was wrapped up  
warmly in a fleece, hat and gloves as she jogged along Chelsea 
Embankment yesterday morning, when the male runner set out in the  
afternoon he was dressed for summer in shorts and a T-shirt.

The sunny east of England was warmer 
than the south of France and Spanish costas, and beat the freak high of 
18.7c (65.7f) in Birmingham on February 23.

But the west remained chilly in 
places, with temperatures reaching only 6c (43f) in Manchester and 11c 
(52f) in Plymouth, on the south-west coast.

Yesterday’s temperatures are the best 
we will see this week, as from today they will cool to highs of 14c 
(57f), falling to 10c (50f) on Sunday. The fog merited a Met Office 
weather warning from Wales down to Somerset, and eastwards across the 
Midlands and the Home Counties.

It was caused by moist air meeting 
chilly night-time conditions, with temperatures falling as low as -3c 
(27f) in the early hours of Thursday.

Several road crashes were reported 
during the morning rush hour and  at least 20 flights were cancelled  
from London airports, with many others delayed.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell 
said: ‘There was fog across a considerable swathe of the country which 
is  typical for the early part of spring when we get cold nights and 
light winds, but it did clear remarkably quickly, at least in the east 
of the country.’

The spate of warm and dry weather has 
fuelled predictions of a second early spring. Last year’s was one of the
earliest on record.

Office workers in shirtsleeves soaked 
up the sun in Richmond Park in London yesterday, but today and tomorrow 
rain will sweep the country.

It will start falling in the north and
west today, moving eastwards overnight and into Saturday – even hitting
the drought-hit south and east.

But it will not be enough to dent the 
dry conditions, which have prompted water companies to introduce 
hosepipe bans for 20million people.

The latest Met Office figures show 
that rainfall in the south and east was less than a third of the 
long-term average for these areas during February. In Lincolnshire it 
was just 5mm compared to the normal 60mm.
