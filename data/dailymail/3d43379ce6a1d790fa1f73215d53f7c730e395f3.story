Katherine Quinn said she was trying to 'turn a negative situation into a positive one' when confronted by the patient

A nurse has admitted handing a distressed psychiatric patient a razor which she then used to harm herself with.

Katherine Quinn was working on the Trinity Ward in Antelope House, Southampton, when she handed the woman a blade, a hearing was told.

The patient had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and had a history of self harm.

Quinn, who was working the night shift, reported her actions to the day staff the next morning.

Jennifer Searles, who was Quinn’s line manager at the time, said: ‘She told me that she read the care plan twice and could not see what to do if she (the patient) became distressed.

‘She was aware of policies within other trusts which allowed staff to give razors to patients in order for them to self harm.

‘She told me that she was trying to turn a negative situation into a positive one. She told me that she was trying to do her best for the patient at the time.’

Miss Searles told the panel that Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust did not allow patients to be handed harmful instruments.

‘Katherine should at no point have given patient A a razor blade. It is not acceptable on the ward to provide materials for a patient to self harm,’ she said.

‘It is emphasised in all staff training on the ward that you do not give aid to a patient to self harm.’

During a meeting with Miss Searles, Quinn also admitted that she had forgotten to complete an incident form for patient A 'because she was busy with another patient and was getting a lift home following the shift.'

Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Antelope House (pictured), says it does not allow harmful instruments to be given to patients

Miss Searles added: ‘She told me that she intended to complete the form the following day.’

Quinn admits providing inappropriate care to patient A, failing to follow the care plan, providing a razor blade to the patient, failing to check the self harm wound and failing to seek appropriate advice for patient A.

If the panel find that her fitness to practice is impaired, she could be struck off the register.

The hearing continues.
