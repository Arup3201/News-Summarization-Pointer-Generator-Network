A mother and father pictured clutching two young girls outside the flattened Briarwood Elementary School in a now-iconic photograph of Monday's tornado devastation last night described the horrific ordeal.

Ledonna Cobb, who was inside a classroom when the EF-5 twister struck, said she was 'grabbing onto whatever I could' in an attempt to stay grounded and protect the students she had used her own body to shield.

'I was just grabbing onto whatever I could,' she said. 'Once the roof came off the building I felt myself being sucked and I knew if I was taken, all the babies underneath me would be gone too so I just held on. I held on for dear life.'

Ms Cobb is shown in the harrowing 
image bruised and dripping with blood. She said she was knocked out when
 one of the classroom walls fell on top of her.
 In the picture, she is seen walking behind her husband, Steve Cobb, who
 is clutching their daughter, Jordan, to his chest desperately, with the 
pulverized school in the background.

'I decided to be the best dad I could
 at that time and wanted (Jordan) to feel like she was safe and that we were all going to be OK,' Mr Cobb told Dianne Sawyer on ABC World News, 
describing the photograph that has graced newspaper covers and websites 
the world over.

'It's like you're in a movie. It's like everyone is playing a part and we were all acting or something like that. It doesn't seem real to you that this is occurring.'

Little Jordan told Sawyer the frightening tornado seemed to go on 'forever.'

'It seemed like it was an hour, it was crazy. I can't even believe we survived that,' she said.

She then explained how she was struck by debris as the twister obliterated her school.

'I tried to get up and I tried to move the bricks 
off of my leg,' she said. 'The tornado had not left yet and it hurt so much I was screaming "help, my leg, my leg" 
but no one could hear me.'

The desperate search continued overnight for two dozen children feared dead after yesterday's monstrous tornado, which already took the lives of seven of their classmates

The brave family stayed for a while at the school
 after they were reunited in an effort to help comfort other traumatized
 children who were yet to find their own parents. The memorable photograph shows Ms Cobb as she walks hand-in-hand with a barefoot young student, as the little girl sobs.

'I wish I could have split myself into two to try help out some of 
the other kids because I could imagine how they were feeling at that time, 
when their parents weren't there and they were wandering around,' Mr Cobb told Sawyer.

Ms Cobb went on: 'I could not leave the other kids. They're all special to me and I couldn't leave them. I wanted my family to be safe but I also wanted everybody else's families to be safe too.'

Miraculously, all Briarwood Elementary students survived the carnage, though students at the nearby Plaza Towers Elementary School weren't so lucky.

The family's heroic account comes as hopes of finding victims alive more than 24 hours after the monster two mile-wide tornado fade.

On Tuesday night, authorities said rescuers had searched every home in the devastated suburb of Moore and they were '98 per cent sure' there are no more bodies or survivors in the rubble.

'We've checked the area with thermal imagers, as well as gone door to door, so we feel like we're fixing to go from rescue and searching to recovery,' Lewis told CNN.

Earlier on Tuesday, emergency crews began searching flattened homes and piles of rubble with cadaver dogs.

No survivors were found yesterday, 
and officials said they hoped to complete three searches of every site of
 devastation before nightfall on Tuesday.

The storm, which barreled through the 
Oklahoma City suburb for 17 miles on Monday, injured 237 people and 
killed at least 24, including nine children and four people in Oklahoma 
City. The heartbreaking-to-read Twitter hashtag #OKMissing has been set up to help families and friends search for missing loved ones.

On Monday, emergency workers pulled more than 100 survivors from the debris of homes, schools and a hospital.

Injuries of adult patients ranged from minor — cuts and bruises, people wet and suffering from hypothermia to major injuries including open wounds, impalements and broken bones. There were also 'degloving' injuries, in which skin is peeled from the tissue.

The weather service confirmed on Tuesday that the powerful storm was an EF5 - the maximum on the scale.

Seven of the children were found drowned at Plaza Towers Elementary School, which was a direct hit during the 45 minutes of terror.

Nine-year-old Janae Hornsby, whose father said 'always has a smile on her face', is one of the seven children. Family members shared pictures of other missing children, including Kyle Davis, 8, and Sydney Angle. Later, Davis' family confirmed he had also died.

At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, an official confirmed that the two schools which were leveled by the storm did not have safe rooms, as they had not applied for them. He added that the jurisdiction decides where to allocate funds for safe rooms based on past events.

'I would like to extend my sincere 
sympathies to all those who have suffered losses,' Susan Pierce, from 
Moore Public Schools, said in an emotional speech. 'Our hearts go out to
 each of you and please know we are all here with you.'

She added that while the path of the tornado was unpredictable, all storm procedures were implemented at every school site.

Another hero at Briarwood Elementary School described how she was impaled as she protected her students during the deadly tornado after 200mph winds spewed out deadly debris.

First-grade teacher, Suzanne Hale, who, like Ms Cobb, had been using her body to shield children, suffered a horrifying injury where her lower right leg was shot through by a metal pole.

It appears that Ms Haley had her leg pierced by the leg of a chair or table.

Ms Haley told FOX 25 that she was dug out of the wreckage by firefighters who braced her leg. She was driven to hospital in the bed of a truck and went into shock.
