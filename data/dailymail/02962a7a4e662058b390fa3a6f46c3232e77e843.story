It can be easy to judge someone based on their taste in music. 

Heavy metal-fans, for instance, are often thought to share a common sense of alienation, oppression and anger, with their music giving them an outlet for their rage.

It’s a stereotype that’s reinforced by the genre’s roots with metal gaining popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s in economically ravaged, deindustrialised areas. 

But while heavy metal may have once 
appealed to alienated working-class males, today the music enjoys its 
greatest popularity in the most advanced, wealthy, and knowledge-based 
areas of the world.

Writing in City Lab, Toronto-based Richard Florida highlights a map that tracks the number of heavy metal bands per 100,000 residents using data from the Encyclopaedia Metallum.

It shows how the genre holds less influence in the post-industrial places of its birth, but remains extremely popular in wealthy, safe and stable Scandinavian countries.

Mr Florida, and his Martin Prosperity Institute colleague Charlotta Mellander, examined the connections between heavy metal and a range of economic and social factors to uncover a pattern.

They found that the number of heavy metal bands per country was linked with the nation’s economic output, level of creativity and entrepreneurship.

A higher share of adults that hold degrees, as well as better levels of human development, well-being, and satisfaction with life, were all related to a larger fan base for heavy metal.

Ms Mellander, who is Swedish, claims Scandinavia’s love for heavy metal bands is directly related to the government's efforts to put compulsory music training in schools.

This, she claims, has created a generation able to meet metal’s technical demands.

‘While new musical forms may spring from disadvantaged, disgruntled, or marginalised groups,’ added Mr Florida, ‘It is the most advanced and wealthy societies that have the media and entertainment companies that can propagate new sounds and genres, as well as the affluent young consumers with plenty of leisure time who can buy it.’

Heavy metal music fans are often labelled as angry and unruly - but how close is this to the truth?

A study by Westminster University has attempted to find out by digging deep into what makes metal aficionados tick.

Psychologist
 Viren Swami asked 219 women and 195 men living in the UK to fill out 
surveys about their personality after listening to and rating 10 heavy 
metal tracks.

The
 research, published in Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the 
Arts, focused on contemporary metal music characterised by heavy guitar 
riffs, double-bass drumming, complex rhythms and extreme tempos.

By
 matching music preference to the personality traits, Professor Swami 
found that ‘openness to experience’ was a major factor in enjoying heavy
 metal.

Perhaps
 more surprising however, was the fact that those with a strong 
preference for metal were more likely to have lower self-esteem.

Metal heads also had a higher-than-average need for uniqueness, and lower-than-average levels of religiosity.
