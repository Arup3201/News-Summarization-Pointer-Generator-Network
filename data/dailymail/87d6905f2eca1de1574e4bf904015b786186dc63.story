A Texas woman who blamed herself for a car crash that killed her fiancé in 2004 is suing General Motors over claims that it covered up problems with the ignition.

Candice Anderson was severely injured when her Saturn Ion went off the road ten years ago in a crash that killed Mikale Erickson.

She pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide but the 31-year-old says she now believes GM was to blame and that the car manufacturer knew about the fault before she was charged.

Guilt: For ten years Candice Anderson blamed herself for the crash that killed her fiancé

According to court documents, Ms Anderson is trying to reopen the lawsuit over claims that GM covered up faulty ignition switches.

Ms Anderson
claimed that a recent letter from the National
 Highway Safety Administration confirmed that her fiancé's death was one of 13 included in the car maker's investigation into the defect.

'For 10 years, I thought I caused the death of my best friend. It's a lot to carry,' Ms Anderson told Fox DFW.

'Five months before I pled guilty, they 
knew. They had the investigation, everything was going 
on…they sat on their hands and watched me go through that. It's 
unbelievable,' she said.

After the crash, Ms Anderson was sentenced to five years of deferred punishment and 260 hours of community service.

She was also ordered to pay for Mr Erikson's funeral and $3,500 in court costs, according to a spokeswoman for her lawyer, Robert Hilliard.

Ms Anderson found out about the recall through Mr Erikson's mother, who had contacted the National Transportation Safety Board to find out if the Saturn was part of the recall.

It was not only confirmed to be part of the recall, but officials said it was one of 13 deadly accidents attributed to the faulty switch, Rhonda Erickson discovered.

Ms Anderson had sued GM along with Erikson's mother after the accident, and settled for $75,000. According to Ms Anderson's attorney, GM had blamed her for the accident.

'GM placed 100 percent of the blame on a 21-year-old innocent girl and ended up paying $75,000 to settle the entire case,' attorney Mr Hilliard, who is representing Erickson's family and Ms Anderson, said.

'She pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and spent years wracked with guilt about Mr  Erickson’s death,' Mr Hilliard told CBS DFW.

His client had been driving her new Ion in November 2004 when it veered off a country road and hit a tree.

Erikson, who had two children, died and Ms Anderson suffered head injuries, a severed liver, ruptured spleen and broken bones.

Faulty: The crash is one of 13 fatal accidents being blamed on the defective GM ignition switch

Traces of anti-anxiety medication, which Ms Anderson had taken the day before, were found in her bloodstream and there were no skid marks on the road. She was later faced felony charges.

As she seeks to reopen the case, Ms Anderson said she wanted GM to be held accountable.

Her lawsuit alleges that a faulty GM ignition switch was the real cause of the crash. It contends the switch slipped out of the run position, knocking out power steering and brakes and disabling the air bags.

GM, the lawsuit alleges, knew about the bad switches but failed to disclose the problem even though Anderson was pleading guilty.

A spokesman for GM said: 'We are taking responsibility for what has happened by taking 
steps to treat victims and their families with compassion, decency and 
fairness.

'We made serious mistakes in the past and as a result we're 
making significant changes in our company to ensure they never happen 
again.'
