Adebayo Akinfenwa looks and sounds like a man living the dream.

He bounds in for this interview and shoots a beaming smile, still buzzing from a surreal couple of days in which he went from lower-league cult hero to a globally-trending superstar.

The shirt given to him by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard after AFC Wimbledon’s courageous FA Cup third round efforts on Monday night hasn't left his side since. He keeps glancing towards it, smiling. You sense he’ll never tire of telling that story.

It is a predictably firm handshake. You don’t earn a nickname like ‘The Beast’ for being a scrawny shrinking violet.

Akinfenwa is certainly a big guy and a big personality and he plays perfectly to the fan’s love of anyone who for whatever reason doesn't conform to the stereotype of what a footballer should look like.

Here are the numbers of ‘The Beast’: he is 32 years of age, stands at 5ft 11in and weighs in at about 16st. He can bench press 180kg - or two-and-a-half Raheem Sterlings. He has played for 12 clubs in a career often described as ‘journeyman’ and plundered 160 goals.

The 160th of those came in the 36th minute at Kingsmeadow on Monday when, despite his perceived slowness, he was quickest to react when goalkeeper Simon Mignolet flapped at a corner and drew the League Two side level at 1-1.

Were it not for Gerrard’s two inspired interventions, Liverpool could easily have fallen victim to the greatest Cup shock of modern times. 

Still ‘The Beast’, having threatened to punch any team-mate who objected, gained the perfect souvenir from his idol.

‘Yeah, he signed it for me,’ he said, glancing again at the crumple of red on the table. ‘I’m grateful and I’m happy. It’s getting framed by the end of this week. I’m going to put it with the shirt I wore and have a little souvenir of a momentous day.’

Whether they’d previously seen Akinfenwa terrorising League Two defences or seen him play for the first time on BBC One on Monday, fans have wanted to know what makes up his diet and gym routine.

Here’s a typical day on the ‘Beast Diet’: ‘Breakfast is Weetabix with honey. At training there will be some kind of chicken. Our chef personally does chicken for me and that makes me very happy.

‘Then a shake in the afternoon. For dinner, again it’s probably chicken, potato and coleslaw. My partner is half-Nigerian, half-Caribbean so it may be the curry goat, rice and potato. It’s the carbs I need to eat.

‘I throw in the odd Nandos. Quarter-chicken, medium breast, chips, corn on the cob and five wings. I don’t deviate.’

Then something of a surprise: ‘Medium spice though, I can’t take hot. I know people keep thinking I do but I’m not a spicy kind of man.’

He then adds: ‘My fitness guy doesn’t think I eat enough. He always tries to get me to eat more.’ Wow.

Such feasts certainly explain Akinfenwa’s size but what about the power and strength that makes him so difficult to defend against. That is explained by daily visits to the gym - the ‘Beast work-out.’

‘I can’t forget the notion I’m a footballer, so I can’t just keep pumping and pumping because I’ve still got to run around,’ he said.

‘Gym sessions will always consist of 40 minutes to one-hour cardio. I try to stay off the treadmill because of the pounding, so it’s the rower or the cross-trainer.

‘Then I go on to the stuff I really enjoy - the weights. Depending on the day, it’ll be the shoulders or arms or back.

‘I’ve done the 180kg [bench press] when I go to the gym with my younger brother - he’s my trainer and he pushes me. The big weights come into play. But I do maybe 120kg every day. I know what I need to do.’

And that regimen - day-after-day, season-after-season - has built ‘The Beast’.

Akinfenwa already has a clothing line called ‘Beast Mode On’ and I suggest his next business venture could be a ‘Beast’ cookery show on Saturday morning TV and a ‘Beast Body’ DVD out in time for Christmas. ‘That’s quite a good plan,’ he smiles. 

Akinfenwa has issued an appeal to former Dons star Vinnie Jones, seen here in 1998 film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, for a part in his next movie 

The point is, Akinfenwa is unique. Few lower-league players have their own fashion label, few go viral on Twitter and few are considered such an authority that they sit around a table with Rio Ferdinand, Joey Barton and Kyle Walker to pick their FIFA 15 Ultimate Team.

But then, as the player with the highest strength rating on the wildly popular video game, nobody is going to argue with him.

And the next target in the Beast’s quest for world domination could be Hollywood, using his Dons connections to land a part in Vinnie Jones' next movie.

‘He hasn’t even hit me up. Hey Vinnie! Vinnie, if you’re reading this… let’s do a movie together,’ he said.

‘I want to do something different to the stereotype - me being a security guard or a bouncer or a hitman. I’m thinking something like the love interest - I take Vinnie’s girl or something. I could work that.

‘In the end, we do a sing-song. They wouldn’t see that coming.’

It could well be a blockbuster.
