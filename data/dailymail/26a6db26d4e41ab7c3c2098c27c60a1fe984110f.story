THE pale blue coffin was so small the pallbearer carried it into church in his arms.

A steady stream of mourners, many fighting back tears, followed him, all wishing to pay their respects to the boy with no name who was found dumped by a stream.

The child – no more than a month old – had lain undiscovered, his body wrapped in a fleece, until a dog walker stumbled across him eight months ago in a remote part of Lancashire. Despite extensive inquiries, his parents have never been found.

Tragic: The coffin was carried into the church by a funeral director whilst floral wreaths and teddy bears were laid at the church paying tribute to the 'llittle angel' and saying 'Be at peace sweet child'

Tributes: The boy no more than a month old was born full term but was abandoned on the banks of a stream last October

So he will lie in a grave with a headstone carved with the words ‘Baby boy found in Kirkham’.

Despite never knowing the love of a family, however, his passing did not go unmourned.

The poignant burial was attended by scores of locals at St Michael’s Parish Church, Kirkham.

Moved by his story, they clubbed together to raise £1,000 to pay for the service.

Grief: All members of the community were invited to the funeral. The order of service entitled 'Funeral Service for a baby boy' was headed by the words: 'celebrate life'

The coffin was carried into the church
by funeral director Bill Crawford, whilst floral wreaths and teddy 
bears were laid outside paying tribute to the ‘Little angel’ or ‘Little 
Moses’.

One card read: ‘Be at peace sweet 
child.’ The order of service, entitled ‘Funeral service for a baby boy’ 
was headed with the words ‘Celebrate life.’

Mourners sang the hymn All Things 
Bright and Beautiful, and listened to readings of Psalm 139 by three 
local primary school headteachers and a passage from Mark Chapter 10 by 
Detective Inspector Martin Clague, one of the officers investigating the
case.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrea 
Barrow, of Lancashire Constabulary, who is leading the inquiry, lit a 
candle during the 30-minute service and BBC’s Crimewatch, which featured
an appeal to trace the baby’s family, sent flowers.

Touching: Tributes were left by shocked members of the community - Lancashire Police are still desperately searching for the family of the boy

The service concluded with a rendition of Brahms’s Lullaby, sung by the church choir.

‘Some cases get to you, and this is 
one,’ DCI Barrow said. ‘We will never give up hope of learning how the 
little boy came to be placed in this remote area.

‘It was so far off the beaten track, it could have only been known to someone familiar with the locality.

‘Whoever did this will remember it 
every day of their lives. It will be immensely traumatic. That’s why 
it’s important they get help too, tell us what happened.’

She added: ‘We don’t know whether he 
ever lived after birth. We don’t know the cause of death. We don’t want 
to speculate. Someone out there knows what happened. It is not too late 
to talk to us. We’ve still got a team working on this case.

Mystery: Even his ethnicity remains unknown, although DNA and forensic tests continue

‘We will not rest and leave no stone unturned until we get to the bottom of exactly what has happened.

‘The people of Kirkham have clearly 
been deeply moved and I would like to thank them for pulling together in
the face of this tragedy to raise money and offer their services so 
that this little boy can be put to rest.’ A Blackpool council bin bag 
was found close to the baby’s body beside two towels, one green and one 
with a Union Jack motif.

Officers released an image of the 
fleece which swaddled him, with the emblem of the Asda supermarket on 
it, in the hope it would be recognised.

They also posted an advert on 
Facebook, which has attracted 1,900 views, and a YouTube video appeal, 
which has reached more than 2,500 people, but so far nobody has come 
forward.

A man of 35 was arrested on suspicion 
of murder, claiming he had been involved in the death of the infant, but
released without charge after detectives concluded he had nothing to do
with the tragedy.

Following the service, the Reverend 
Richard Bunday, vicar of Kirkham, said it provided the community with a 
chance to ‘pause, reflect and consider the precious gift of human life’.

‘This potential was not given to the 
baby boy and so we mourn his passing, but remind ourselves he  is held 
by God and enfolded in his love,’ he said.
