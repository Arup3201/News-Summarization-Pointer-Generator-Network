Lucan Battison was suspended from a New Zealand Catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today

A long-haired New Zealand teenager has landed himself in court after refusing to abide by his school's rules and cut his curly locks.

St John's College student Lucan Battison was subsequently suspended by principal Paul Melloy last month. However the suspension was cleared on the basis that the 16-year-old returned with shorter hair.

The matter has since been taken to the High Court at Wellington for a judicial review sought after by his father Troy Battison and Lucan has not returned to school.

The teenager's lawyer Jol Bates said the year 12 student stood up for his rights and followed the example of humanitarian activist Martin Luther King Jr, the court heard on Monday.

Mr Bates added that Lucan isn't comfortable with cutting his curly hair as it would become 'boofy and turned into an afro', reported the New Zealand Herald.

Mr Bates said Lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the Catholic college three years ago.

The court was also told that his hair does not pose any health and safety concerns nor was it a distraction to other pupils.

Lucan, who had his hair tied back at during the hearing, listened to the school's lawyer Richard Harrison as he said a teacher had sent the teenager to Mr Melloy's office as his hair had overgrown its acceptable length.

When asked to cut his hair, Lucan refused and asked the principal to contact his father.

Mr Harrison described this as 'continual disobedience' and further said this could be 'harmful and dangerous' as this may influence on other pupils who look up to Lucan.

Justice David Collins asked Mr Melloy why had not considered other disciplinary action and Mr Harrison said the principal ruled out other measures when Lucan chose to go against the school's policy in the presence of his parents.

The case continues.

Mr Bates said his client was standing up for his basic human rights, challenging authority and following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr
