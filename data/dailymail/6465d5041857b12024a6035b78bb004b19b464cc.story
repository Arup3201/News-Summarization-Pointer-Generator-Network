A worker plummeted five stories to his death while washing windows without a safety harness in Manhattan Tuesday.

The unnamed victim was reportedly leaning out of a fifth-floor unit at the Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell just before 1.10pm.

The window washer landed in front of a high-end rug store, with his head coming to rest in a pile of hardened snow and the rest of his body on the concrete sidewalk.

Grisly accident: A window washer was leaning out of a fifth-floor unit at the Hanover River House at 335 Greenwich Street in Tribeca when fell, landing with his head in a pile of snow and his body on the sidewalk 

Horrified witnesses said the victim was still breathing and conscious by the time first responders came on the scene.

As they were awaiting the paramedics’ arrival, several Good Samaritans walked over and covered the man with their coats to keep him warm against the frigid temperatures, according to the New York Post. 

Responding EMTs performed chest compressions on the injured worker and then rushed him to New York Downtown Hospital, where he died a short time later.

7Online reported that the window the man was washing was unhinged and swung open, causing him to fall out to his death.

Witness Orie Cipollaro described the 38-year-old worker hanging out of the window backwards in the minutes before the deadly fall, while another bystander claimed he saw the man hold onto the window with one hand while washing it with the other, reported the New York Daily News. 

In an interview with the News, witness John Cataneo described a grisly scene on Greenwich Street this afternoon.

‘His legs were twisted his arms were bent and he was bleeding from his hands, it was very gruesome,’ Cataneo recalled.

Employer: The deceased window washer worked for Aerial Window Cleaning, headquarterd in this building at 260 West 36th Street

The name of the victim has not been released as of 5pm, but he was said to be a 38-year-old man employed by Aerial Window Cleaning.

According to the company's Google+ page, Aerial Window Cleaning, located at 260 West 36th Street, has been in business for more than 20 years.

Daily Mail reached out to the cleaning company for comment and is awaiting a response.
