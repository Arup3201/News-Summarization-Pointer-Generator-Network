Just nine games in to the Sky Bet Championship season and Norwich City are already 16 points clear of Fulham, and eight ahead of Cardiff.

For the trio relegated from the Barclays Premier League in May, it is hard not to conclude that their current league positions - first, 15th and 23rd respectively - are a direct result of each club's preparations for the 2014-15 campaign.

While Fulham were still frantically buying and selling with no apparent plan right up to the close of the transfer window last month, Norwich had a settled and balanced squad before the first ball of the season was kicked. Cardiff, too, were preoccupied with transfer dealings and distracted by off-field squabbles when they should have been concentrating on their fixtures.

It was no surprise then when Felix Magath lost his job at Fulham after their disastrous start and when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's stay in South Wales came to an end 11 days ago.

While all this has been going on, Norwich have been making serene and steady progress under Neil Adams. They sit top of the table after the weekend's fixtures. It is no fluke.

Faced with the very real possibility of relegation in April, the Norwich board sacked Chris Hughton. They were in fact five points clear of the drop zone at the time, but with a nightmare run of fixtures coming up they made the bold move to invest in the long-term in favour of the short.

In came Adams, so successful as Norwich's youth coach and a man with close ties to the club from his playing career.

Hughton had achieved an 11th-placed finish the season before but a steady decline had seen the natives grow restless as transfer funds were wasted on failed foreign imports such as Ricky van Wolfswinkel.

In hiring Adams, chief executive David McNally felt, even if Norwich went down, the feel-good factor would soon be back in Norfolk.

And so it is proving, even if we are only nine games in to the season. 

Felix Magath's transfer policy was highly quested at Fulham during the close season 

The club sold their prized assets for top dollar; swiftly and efficiently and with no hard feelings. Handsome fees were brought in for Robert Snodgrass and Leroy Fer, among others, allowing Adams to concentrate on adding Championship experience and a sprinkling of youth from the club's academy to an already strong squad.

While Norwich were not turning many heads with their pre-season work, one senses that was exactly the plan.

Contrast that to the circuses going on at Craven Cottage and the Cardiff City Stadium this year, and it is easy to see how such a gap has already opened up between Norwich and their relegated counterparts.

Mercifully, things finally seem to be moving in the right direction at Fulham and Cardiff, but the moral of the story is never to underestimate the Championship.

Russell Slade is primed to take over the manager's job at Cardiff after leaving Leyton Orient next week 

While Russell Slade looks to be a shrewd appointment at Cardiff and Kit Symons is steadying the ship at Fulham, you cannot afford to give your rivals a nine-game headstart at this level, no matter how much money you have to spend in January.

The Football League is littered with clubs who have taken years to recover from relegation from the top flight because they didn't face up to it in time and invest in their long-term futures.

Norwich were one of those clubs. Never recovering from relegation in 2005 and eventually slipping down in to League One in 2009.

Perhaps that is why they have made moves to make sure the same doesn't happen again.

Good week for... BRENTFORD. Here's a stat for you: Brentford are the only side in the top half of the Championship not to have played in the Premier League before. More importantly, Saturday's 2-0 win over Leeds at Griffin Park has lifted Mark Warburton's Bees nine points clear of the relegation zone. Keep up this form, and soon they may be able to start dreaming of the play-offs. 

Bad week for... BARNSLEY. Returning for a second spell at Oakwell after he guided the club to the top flight in 1997, Danny Wilson thought he had assembled a Barnsley squad capable of returning to the Championship at the first attempt this season. Already though, he appears on borrowed time after Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Swindon. The Tykes are in the League One relegation zone.

After a poor start to the season, Exeter are well and truly up and running following three successive victories, the latest coming against Bury, who led the League Two table before their 2-1 defeat on Saturday. Over half of Paul Tisdale's squad have come through the club's academy and perhaps the brighest prospect of them all, 19-year-old midfielder Grimes, showed his class by curling home a left-footed free-kick to give them the lead at St James Park.
