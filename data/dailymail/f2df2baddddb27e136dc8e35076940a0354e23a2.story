An amateur footballer who almost blinded a referee by kicking him in the face for sending him off has been spared jail.

Philip Giles was sent off by match official James Johnson for swearing and aggressive behaviour during a Sunday league match in Manchester.

But as Giles left the field having been sent off, he ran back towards the 19-year-old referee and launched a flying kick at him as Johnson recorded the sending-off in his notebook.

Cowardly: Amateur referee James Johnson thought he had been blinded after the thuggish attack which left him needing six stitches above his right eye

Giles, 22, jumped at Johnson with both feet and kicked him in the face with his left boot.

The official only realised what had happened when he woke up in an ambulance, and needed six stitches to a large wound above his right eye.

The court was told Mr Johnson feared he had lost vision in his right eye and had been left with a permanent scar.

But the violent Sunday league player was spared a prison term after a judge ruled his attack did not pass the custody threshold 'by a whisker'.

Giles, who pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, said he had been ‘infuriated’ by the referee who he thought had been ‘winding him up’ during the match at Turn Moss playing fields, Chorlton, last October.

He was told by the judge, Recorder Arthur Noble: 'It doesn’t need me to emphasise to anyone reading a paper, or seeing a photograph of this injury, that it was extremely unpleasant indeed.

'You risked causing permanent damage to this man’s eyesight. It appears that you regarded the referee with less than favour for some time, and used foul language to an official merely trying to do his job. '

The judge said although the offence crossed the custody threshold, he felt able - ‘by a whisker’ - to suspend a 10-month jail sentence for two years.

The court heard that Giles, of Teddington Close, Moston, became increasingly agitated as his Waldorf FC side fell 2-0 behind to Woodsend Athletic - and had a penalty awarded against them.

Mr Johnson, a Manchester University student, told police the attack was ‘cowardly’ and said it would affect him for life.

He said: 'I was unconscious for a while. There was blood everywhere and I thought I had been blinded, as I could not see through one eye. It was terrifying. '

Michael Knowles, defending, said Giles, who has been banned by the league, had acted on the spur of the moment, never been in trouble before and had expressed genuine remorse.

Giles will be subject to supervision by the Probation Service for 12 months. He was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and to pay his victim £750 compensation.
