Fernando Alonso would appear to have confirmed his intent to remain at Ferrari, despite McLaren's interest in luring him back to Woking.

With Honda powering McLaren again from next season as the Japanese manufacturing giant returns to Formula One after a seven-year absence, they had hoped to attract a stellar name.

It is understood Alonso and Sebastian Vettel are at the top of Honda's wanted list, but the former is contracted through to the end of 2016, with the latter's current deal with Red Bull expiring after 2015.

Return? Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso appears to have ruled out being reunited with McLaren next season

History: Alonso (left) raced for McLaren in 2007 but left the team because he was not given No 1 status due to Lewis Hamilton impressing

McLaren Group chairman and CEO Ron Dennis indicated last week he is a man who respects contracts, and therefore would bide his time to land either Alonso or Vettel, or both.

For his part, Alonso, who drove for McLaren in 2007 before becoming embroiled in an ignominious bust-up that hastened his exit after one year, seems eager to help Ferrari back to winning ways first before moving on.

'From summer last year there has been a lot of talk,' said Alonso, speaking to Sky Sports.

'But from my mouth came nothing about any interest to leave Ferrari, or saying I would join another team.

Interest: McLaren want to sign a big name before season and have also looked at Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel

Wanted: Alonso has been driving in a Ferrari which has not been competitive for several seasons in a row now

'There has been a lot of speculation, which is not disturbing, but... it's half disturbing because it creates a little bit of tension and stress.

'But also you feel happy and proud the best teams have an interest in you, and they say that in public.

'But it's not my intention at the moment to move. As I've said, I want to win for Ferrari here and finish the job we started some years ago.

'We will see what the future holds.'

Happy: Alonso has insisted it is not his 'intention at the moment to move', seemingly committing to Ferrari
