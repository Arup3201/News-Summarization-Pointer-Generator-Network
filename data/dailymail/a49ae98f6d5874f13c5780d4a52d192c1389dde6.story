Tory minister Baroness Warsi has warned David Cameron not to try to 'out-Ukip' Nigel Farage's party in an attempt to woo voters back to the Conservatives.

She also defended Cameron's 2006 description of Ukip supporters as 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists', saying 'I don't think I could have put it any better.'

She acknowledged that the Eurosceptic party has drawn support from both Tory and Labour ranks, but added that a 'chunk' of supporters came from the far-Right.

Baroness Warsi, a Tory minister, has defended David Cameron's 2006 remark that Ukip supporters were 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists'

Speaking to the Huffington Post, she said: 'We're all being much more restrained and much more diplomatic' about Ukip, 'but I don't think I could have put it any better than the way the Prime Minister put it when he described them many years ago.

'Nigel Farage is trying to change his party and how successful he is in that will determine whether the label the Prime Minister gave (Ukip), all those years ago, sticks.'

The rise of Ukip has caused concern among Conservative MPs who fear that their party will be punished at next year's general election as right-wing supporters defect to Nigel Farage.

Ukip's hard-line over Europe has struck a particular chord with the public, leading Cameron to offer voters an in/out referendum by 2017 if the Conservatives win.

However, Warsi warned against such tactics. She said: 'The one thing that no party can do is out-Ukip Ukip to win those voters back.'

Lady Warsi, who was replaced as Conservative Party chairman by Grant Shapps, also defended her successor over the recent 'beer and bingo' Budget advert.

Schapps was widely pilloried after posting an image on Twitter claiming cuts to bingo and beer taxes would 'help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy'.

Warsi, who was Conservative party chairman before Grant Schapps, also backed her successor over the controversial 'bingo' election poster, saying he shouldn't be held solely responsible

But Lady Warsi said: 'I think some of the attacks on Grant Shapps have been incredibly unfair because he's been made to carry the can of decisions which probably involved a whole load of other people before that poster came out.'

Reports have suggested that Chancellor George Osborne had signed off the image, but Lady Warsi said: 'Well, I don't know that...but I'm not convinced (Mr Shapps) should carry the can for this.'

Warsi, who is a senior minister of state at the Foreign Office and minister for faith at the Communities Department, also acknowledged that politics has a 'women problem' adding that the number of female cabinet members needs to increase - there are currently five.

She added that you 'need a mix' of people in politics, achieved by 'surrounding yourself by people from lots of different backgrounds.'

Lady Warsi also offered her assessment of progress in Afghanistan - with combat troops due to come home this year.

She said the UK was leaving Afghanistan 'not having achieved that we said we would achieve over a decade and a half ago, but leaving it a much better country than we found'.
