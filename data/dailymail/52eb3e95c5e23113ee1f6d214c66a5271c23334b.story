A bronze and enamel cockerel placed in the grave of a two year old Roman girl as a message to the Gods has gone on display after a 'stunning' restoration.

Archaeologists made the discovery in Cirencester two years ago, and say it is only of only eight known in the Roman Empire.

They believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave by loving parents hoping it would ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world'.

The magnificent cockerel was found in child's grave in Roman Cirencester - and has been painstakingly restored. It goes on show in the historic town today

The cockerel had special significance to the Romans and there is a known connection to the god Mercury.

Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base.

The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn.

Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife.

It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world.

The child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel.

The cockerel stands 125mm high and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green.

There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration.

The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing.

Today the restored bird went on show in the Cotswold town where it was found.

Its finders, the Cotswold Archaeology group, say it 'looks absolutely fantastic.'

The 12.5cm bronze figure is thought to have been placed in the child's grave as a message to the gods.

It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury.

Experts say it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife.

The conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts.

Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had 'exceeded expectations', particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail.

'It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,' he said.

'This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly.

'It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child.'

The cockerel was found during excavation work at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - or Corinium as it was known when it was the second largest town in Roman Britain.

The parts of the cockerel, found in child's grave in Cirencester, which were restored and put back together to a 'stunning' condition

A burial site was unearthed at the 
site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something 
experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the 
1970s.

This
particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a 
total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire.

Mr Holbrook added: 'Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain.

'This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance.'

The
object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence
pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel
artefacts.

Talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester.

Only eight similar cockerel figurines are known from the Roman world, including four from Britain.

The similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop.

Our example is the only one from Britain to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail.

The two which are closest in form are from Cologne in Germany and Buchten in the Netherlands.

In these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow, blue and red and it is probable that the Cirencester example was originally just as brightly coloured.

Britain produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the Roman Empire and these were traded as far afield as Germany, France, Spain and Italy.

The four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from Germany and the Low Countries.
