Billy Hurley III shot a bogey-free seven-under-par 63 to take the midway lead at the Greenbrier Classic.

The 31-year-old started on the back nine and carded three birdies in four holes from the 14th, and after the turn he recorded six threes and three fours.

His final birdie came courtesy of a superb approach to within six feet of the front-left pin position at the seventh, leaving him in pole position for a first career win at nine under for the tournament.

That would also bring with it qualification for the Open Championship, with four places available to the highest-placed players not already qualified - as long as they finish in the top 12 at White Sulphur Springs.

The top four positions after two rounds were all held by Americans still seeking a place at Royal Liverpool later this month, with Kevin Chappell and Chris Stroud both at eight under and Troy Matteson a further shot back.

Matteson was the biggest mover among the group with a round of nine under par, featuring four birdies in the first five holes and five more on the back nine.

Steve Stricker and Chris Kirk, both already assured of their Open places, shared fifth place with Brice Garnett at six under.

The first non-American challengers, Colombia's Camilo Villegas and Swede David Lingmerth, featured in a group at five under that also included Masters champion Bubba Watson.

Two more major winners, Angel Cabrera and Keegan Bradley, followed in the group at four under.
