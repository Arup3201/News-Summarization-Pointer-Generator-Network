The Pakistani Taliban have elected Maulana Fazlullah as their new chief following the death of the previous leader in a U.S. drone strike

A hardline cleric linked to the attack on schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai has been appointed the new chief of the Pakistani Taliban, it emerged today.

Maulana Fazlullah, elected by the Taliban's supreme council, led the militants' brutal two-year rule in Pakistan's north-west valley of Swat in 2007 to 2009, before a military operation retook the area.

Pakistani intelligence also believes 
Fazlullah is linked to the failed attempt to kill schoolgirl education 
activist Malala, who was shot in Swat in October 2012.

Announcing the new leader at a press 
conference in an undisclosed location in northwest Pakistan, caretaker 
chief Asmatullah Shaheen said the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan would not 
negotiate with the government 'until it announces the complete 
enforcement of sharia'.

Nicknamed
'Mullah Radio' for his fiery speeches over the airwaves, Fazlullah 
takes over leadership of the TTP after his predecessor Hakimullah Mehsud
was killed in a U.S. drone strike last Friday.

During
Fazlullah's rule in his home area Swat, the Taliban imposed a rigorous 
version of Islamic law, publicly beheading and flogging wrongdoers and 
burning schools.

Fazlullah
fled Swat when the army retook the valley, and is believed to have been
in hiding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan says he has
directed attacks on its soil from across the border.

His men were blamed for beheading 17 
Pakistani soldiers in a checkpost attack in June 2012, and he appeared 
in a video posted online in September claiming a bomb blast that killed a
major general.

In another video he vowed to do whatever it took to enforce sharia across Pakistan.

'We will eliminate anything that will
get in the way of achieving this goal: father or brother, soldier or 
police, khan or malik (tribal elders) or mullah,' he said in the undated
footage.

The
decision to appoint him leader of the TTP was greeted with heavy 
celebratory gunfire in Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan 
tribal area.

Taliban
'will be more brutal' The TTP, an umbrella organisation grouping 
numerous militant factions, has killed thousands of soldiers, police and
civilians since 2007 in its campaign against the Pakistani state.

The killing of Mehsud in North Waziristan on Friday came as government representatives prepared to meet the militants with a view to opening peace talks.

It drew an angry response from Islamabad, with Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar accusing Washington of sabotaging peace efforts.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was more measured, but said his government was committed to seeking peace through dialogue and stressing that an end to bloodshed could not be achieved 'by unleashing senseless force'.

Sharif came to power in May partly on a pledge to hold talks to try to end the TTP's bloody insurgency, which has fuelled instability in the nuclear-armed nation.

Imtiaz Gul, an author and expert on militancy in Pakistan, warned the choice of such an uncompromising leader would spell problems for the embryonic peace process - and a bloodier campaign from the TTP.

'The nomination of Fazlullah is a 
continuation of the terror campaign in Pakistan since the creation of 
TTP. It means they are not serious about any talks with the government,'
Gul told AFP.

'TTP will be more brutal now.'

On October 9 last year a masked gunman in Pakistan's Swat Valley
jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school 
and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head.

Her
father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but
Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in 
Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and 
voice.

The world's reaction to her attempted 
murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for 
girls' education around the world.

She
has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov 
Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament 
annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov.

Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung 
San Suu Kyi.

No clear progress had been made in peace negotiations before the strike on Mehsud, and Shaheen dismissed the whole process as a sham.

'All the drama in the name of peace talks was staged to please America: on one side government wanted to talk to us and on the other side was talking to the Americans in Washington,' Shaheen said.

'We will not talk to the Pakistani government until it announces the complete enforcement of sharia.'Retired brigadier Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal areas, said Fazlullah's appointment had 'completely changed dynamics of the Pakistani Taliban'.

'Fazlullah was ousted from Swat valley, his hometown, and he is living in Afghanistan. He is wanted by Pakistan, so can he run the organisation smoothly from other side of the Durand Line?' Shah said.

The Durand Line is the border with Afghanistan.

Fazlullah, believed to be about 39, is the first leader not to come from the Mehsud tribe which dominates the TTP, or even the tribal areas, and Shah said this would weaken the movement's unity.

'There are other groups based in North Waziristan who were helping the Pakistani Taliban but they won't help Fazlullah as he can't even live among them,' he said.

The Taliban's ruling council, or shura, took several days to reach a decision, indicating a lack of consensus about who should lead them, but Shaheen insisted the movement was united.
