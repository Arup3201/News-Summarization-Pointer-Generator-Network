A necklace made from the claws of a grizzly bear and a Colt .45 six-shooter once owned by ex-scout and showman 'Buffalo Bill' Cody sold at auction in Dallas for more than $40,000 each.

Heritage Auctions says both sold Saturday for the same sale price: $40,625.

The Dallas-based auction house sold the two pieces during its 'Legends of the West Signature Auction,' which featured nearly 400 collectible items including guns, photos, badges and books.

Star piece: The necklace made from the claws of a grizzly bear was once owned by ex-scout and showman Buffalo Bill Cody which sold at auction in Dallas for more than $40,000

Heritage spokesman Tom Slater says Sioux warrior chief Sitting Bull gave Cody the grizzly bear-claw necklace.

Slater says Cody bought the 1873 Frontier Six-Shooter Revolver from the New York City firearms dealer Hartley & Graham in January 1883.

The
 legendary showman - real name William Cody - bought the six-shooter 
revolver in 1883, the same year he launched his circus-style traveling 
show, which famously featured Sioux Indian Sitting Bull.

He
 was one of the most iconic characters from the American Old West era 
and was a contemporary of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok.

Other piece: A Colt .45 six-shooter once owned by ex-scout and showman. Heritage Auctions says the gun and a necklace made from the claws of a grizzly bear both sold Saturday, June 14, 2014, for the same sale price: $40,625

Although
 unremarkable to look at, the gun became one of Cody's favorite 
firearms and was among the few he still owned at the time of his death 
aged 70 in 1917 from kidney failure.

Cody,
 who earned his nickname hunting buffalo as a young man, was known for 
his generosity and although he owned many guns during his successful 
career he gave most of them away.

He bought the gun at Hartley and Graham in New York while on extended stay with his theater troupe.

He
 used it as a prop in the popular show, which featured displays of 
skill, reenactments of battles and themed sideshows, up until it came to
 a close in 1906.

The
 gun, a Colt Frontier Six Shooter Revolver, was passed down through 
Cody's family until it was sold at auction in 1988 to the current 
vendor, a collector from the US.

Another
 pistol belonging to Cody when he was a scout for the US Army during the
 American Indian Wars sold for $240,000 (£143,000) in 2012.

Lock what else sold: The key to the City of Manchester presented to Buffalo Bill

The
 key to Manchester which was presented to Cody in 1887 following a 
five-month stay in the city while on tour was also up for sale with bidding at $3,200.

Cody
 had taken his Wild West show to England that year to celebrate the 
Jubilee year of Queen Victoria, also performing in London and 
Birmingham.

One
 side of the key is engraved ‘Presented to Buffalo Bill Cody 1887’ while
 the other side reads ‘From the city of Manchester England’.

Tom
 Slater, head of Americana at Heritage Auctions, said: ‘Buffalo Bill had
 dozens of guns over the years but he was a very generous man and gave a
 lot of them away.

‘He only held on to a handful of his most prized guns and this was one of them.

The gun was a prop in Buffalo Bill's popular Wild West show, which featured displays of skill, reinactments of battles and themed sideshows, up until it came to a close in 1906

Partnership: Buffalo Bill with Sitting Bull, who featured in his show for a short while

‘Buffalo Bill used this gun during his famous Wild West show which travelled all over the US and even to continental Europe.

‘He was one of the most famous characters of the American Old West era and so the sale of this gun is hugely significant.

‘Barely a handful of his unembellished handguns are known in public or private collections.

‘He
 chose to keep hold of the gun as it was one of his favorites and it 
remained in his family for a long time so the provenance is exceptional.

‘The
 fact that it is being sold alongside other Cody memorabilia such as the
 key to the city of Manchester makes it a very special sale.’
