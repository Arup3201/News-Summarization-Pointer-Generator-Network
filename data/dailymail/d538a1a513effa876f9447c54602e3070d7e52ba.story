He has sworn to live a cloistered existence, shut off from all the world.

But life after retirement doesn’t seem too lonely for Pope Benedict - with no fewer than four female companions to dote on him.

The former pontiff, who stepped down in February, has been pictured for the first time with the women at his new home, a restored convent within the confines of the Vatican.

Walking with the aid of a stick, Benedict, 86, strolled in the garden of Mater Ecclesiae, with the four lay sisters who are his constant companions.

Rosella, Loredana, Carmella and Cristina, known as ‘the four guardian angels’, previously lived with Benedict in the luxurious Papal apartments and made the move with him to take care of cooking his meals, housework and secretarial work.

Rosella is the most recent arrival, after her predecessor Manuela, was killed in a car accident in 2010.

Loredana, who is from Puglia in the deep south of Italy is the chief cook preparing simple classics such as salmon and zucchini pies and pasta al prosciutto, Italian weekly gossip magazine Oggi reported.

Carmela prepares the puddings, including the strudel from his native Germany that Benedict is crazy about, while Cristina is the secretary.

Relaxed: In May the former Pope was seen walking in the grounds of Castel Gandolfo wearing a white baseball cap days after his retirement

Wearing his favourite white baseball cap to shield his face from the autumn sun and his Papal whites Benedict appeared to have lost weight since he was last pictured in private at the Papal summer palace Castel Gandolfo.

The four women surrounded him protectively as he strolled, stopping to chat with gardeners and workers.

The unusual household’s day starts at dawn, with mass in the chapel followed by breakfast.

After that the Pope Emeritus retires to his study where he replies to his correspondence.

He also spends time divided between meditation and prayer.

In the afternoon he takes a walk in the gardens, usually accompanied by the last member of the ‘family’, private secretary George Ganswein, a former ski instructor known as the George Clooney of the Vatican.

The former Pope also spends a great deal of time reading, especially history and theology, and listening to the music of Mozart and Beethoven.

It is a quiet life- there are not many visitors apart from his brother George who is a frequent guest staying in the spare room.

The former convent has 12 monastic cells over two floors as well as a refectory, kitchen, infirmary and vegetable garden.

It was founded by John Paul II in order to have a monastic group of nuns inside Vatican City, who pray for the pope and the Church.
