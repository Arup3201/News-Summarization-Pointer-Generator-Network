A raging Jimmy Connors making the roof fall in; Vitas Gerulaitis coming in at breakfast time straight from a night out before playing his match; a magical moment with Andy Murray just after he won the title.

These are just a few of the gems in the treasure chest of memories Doug Dickson took away with him from 44 years of looking after generations of stars in the locker rooms of Wimbledon.

He left the All England Club last summer after stumbling into the job during the summer of 1969 and feels ‘privileged’ to have seen close up the world’s greatest players experience the private agony of defeat and the ecstasy of victory.

Raging: Jimmy Connors, always a character, made the roof fall in, Doug Dickson says

As a steward in the inner sanctum of Wimbledon’s main locker room, he bears unique witness to Wimbledon history.

Dickson (no relation) spent the last 18 years as head steward and it ended in fairytale fashion on the last day of his last Championships, with fellow Scot Andy Murray ending the 77-year wait for a British men’s champion.

While Dickson’s love for tennis and all its players shines through, it is clear Murray is among his favourites. One of his duties was to carry out the racket bags of the men’s finalists onto court and supervise their removal at the end.

So it was that he was the first  person to encounter the new champion when he stepped off  Centre Court on that heady afternoon 12 months ago.

‘The first thing Andy said to me was “Don’t I get a hug then?” so I gave him a hug. But I just couldn’t speak, I was too choked up for him,’ says Dickson. 

It tells you something about Murray’s true character that the  following Friday, Dickson’s last day at work, the champion went back to the All England Club to say goodbye, presenting him with a signed racket he used in the final.

‘It is my most treasured possession  but that’s the kind of bloke Andy is and maybe people don’t always see,’ says Dickson.

‘He is basically a very kind and thoughtful person, with a great sense of humour, too.’

Not so happy: Connors smashed open a ceiling after a first round loss at Wimbledon one year

Dickson also witnessed players at their most angry and frustrated and one afternoon in 1986 with Connors stands out.

He says: ‘Jimmy was an amazing competitor and character and he had lost in the first round. He came in afterwards and hurled his racket at the ceiling. 

‘The problem was that at the time it was one of these false ceilings of thin panels held up by thin metal plates. Somehow he completely dislodged a number of them and left a huge hole, with all the dust and debris that had accumulated on top crashing down.

‘He was so angry that he stripped off to his jockstrap and socks and stormed off down the corridor to the transport room, right by the entrance to the Royal Box. 

‘My colleague, Leo Turner, had to run after him and cover him with a towel so there wouldn’t be any  surprises for anyone coming out of the Box. He was driven off straight away.’

It is the hugely charismatic former world No 3 Gerulaitis — who was to die tragically young at 40 —  who left the biggest imprint.

Gift: Through all the years of experience at the Championships, Murray's parting present was special

‘I never met anyone with such a sheer appetite for life,’ says Dickson.

‘He came in one morning about eight o’clock in jeans and a smart jacket and told me that he hadn’t been to bed yet. 

‘So I found him a physio’s couch in a quiet corner to lie down. I gave him a shake and a cup of coffee  an hour later and he was straight  up and about. Then he went out  a bit later and won his match.’

Unthinkable now but it was a  different age when Dickson, an accountant by training, first arrived at SW19. Rod Laver was the big beast back then and was halfway through winning all four majors.

‘Rod was quite a shy, quiet man,’ says Dickson. ‘What marked him and Ken Rosewall out was that it was clear they were very much there for business. 

‘There were still a lot of guys from the amateur days around but those two were extremely professional.’

The advent of Bjorn Borg heralded the start of the great tennis boom of the Seventies and Eighties, with unprecedented scenes of adulation at the All England Club. 

‘It was like The Beatles and caused quite a few problems,’ Dickson recalls. ‘For the first time security and protection was needed to get him from his car into the main building because he was getting mobbed, mainly by young girls. 

‘Some people at the club were very uncomfortable with it all. Inside the locker room he had this Zen-like calm. The biggest challenge for us was finding somewhere to put his rackets. In those days players still might have only two or three but Bjorn would come in with 18 or 20, sometimes we’d just have to pile them on top of the lockers.’

And then came the incomparable John McEnroe, another star Dickson especially liked, along with Pat Cash. He says: ‘I’d talk a lot with John because I was into American sports. 

‘He was just this American college kid when he first came in. He was very different off the court to on it. One thing he did was always keep a racket back in his locker at room temperature — when word came from the court that he wanted his spare racket you knew he was  having a bad day.’

Dickson rarely saw tempers fray between players in the locker room and, while he wants to keep such incidents private, he makes the interesting observation that the cause is often something said during matches by an opponent’s entourage or over enthusiastic support.

In the present era a calmer  example is set by the top players. 

‘Roger [Federer] was a bit hotheaded as a junior but you could quickly tell the others feared him because he was so good,’ says  Dickson. ‘He is very statesman-like and reminds me a bit of Laver because of the business-like way he goes about things.

‘The small thing I’ll remember about Novak [Djokovic] was how brilliant he was at geography. 

‘There was this computer game the players liked in which you had to pinpoint cities on a blank map of Europe, he was incredibly good at it, he is very intelligent. 

‘He has become different from most in that he now spends hardly any time in the locker room, he’ll plan it so he only comes in the  minimal time before his matches. Rafa [Nadal] — you can’t help but like him, there is still this boy-next-door quality and he is incredibly nice with people. After a good win Rafa likes to celebrate with an ice cream, so it was important to make sure that the freezer was stocked with them.’

These days the main locker room is open to the world’s top 50, the top four doubles pairings, plus players who are All England Club members, regardless of their rankings, such as past champions.

Gone are the exposed pipes and communal baths, replaced by power showers, treatment rooms and private bathrooms — except they are never used for baths as most people would know them.

‘I haven’t run a hot bath for anyone for about 15 years,’ says Dickson. ‘If anyone goes in the bath it’s for an ice bath — or they go in there to have some privacy and maybe shed some tears in private. ‘It’s important to know when to leave people alone and that’s where they’ll often go.

‘Players have different ways of reacting to defeat. 

‘Anders Jarryd [the Swedish former top-10 singles player] had this ritual where he would come in after a loss and stare in silence at his locker for up to an hour. Then he would physically rip the shirt off himself and move on, as if he had achieved closure.’

Watchful eye: Djokovic's practice is watched over by coach Boris Becker as he limbers up at SW19

As tennis has evolved into a massive international business with huge prize money, the atmosphere has become more serious, although not without elements of fun.

‘The putting competition has become a big thing now, almost  everyone joins in,’ says Dickson. ‘It started with someone bringing in one of those cup-like golf holes that spit the ball out but now it’s become almost like crazy golf.

‘The hole has become so long that they start it in the showers.

‘There is still a lot of banter. All tennis players seem to be football crazy and that’s what a lot of it is about. 

‘An important thing in the years of a big football championship is to make sure you get the right matches on the TVs along with the tennis.’

That will be the case this year but one of the most established fixtures in the locker room will not be there to supervise it, gone the same way as many of the traditional features at an institution which has ruthlessly renewed itself.

There will be many players who miss the avuncular, reassuring  presence of a familiar figure in  his white steward’s coat — and the feeling will be mutual.

Doug Dickson's last day working during a Wimbledon fortnight was quite special... it was the day Andy Murray ended Britain’s 77-year wait for a men’s champion.

And Murray made it even more special the following Friday.

It was Dickson’s last official day at work and Murray,  now the proud Wimbledon champion, returned to the All England Club to say farewell and present his fellow Scot with one of the rackets he had used in the final.

‘It is my most treasured possession,’ says Dickson, ‘But that’s the kind of bloke Andy is.’
