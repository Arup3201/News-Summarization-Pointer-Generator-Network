Veteran Boston Red Sox commentator Jerry Remy has announced that he plans to return this season after he stepped out of the spotlight while his family dealt with his son's arrest for the brutal murder of his girlfriend.

Mr Remy, 61, held an emotional press conference at the New England Sports Network's headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts on Monday where he said that people could insult him but not his wife Phoebe who he staunchly defended as a 'good parent'. 

Remy said he concerned with what the public would think of him and if he could still be his normal, jokey self on air. The sports caster said friends and family persuaded him to return to work after reminding him about his career 'and where it came from and where it is'.

His son Jared Remy, 34, is accused of the murder of Jennifer Martel, 27, who he allegedly pinned to the patio at their Waltham home and stabbed repeatedly in front of their 
5-year-old daughter Arianna last August.

Mr Remy, 61, told a press conference: 'Call me a bad father if you want. But I’ll be damned if my wife is not a good parent.', Boston.com reported.

The couple have three adult children Jared, Jordan and Jenna. Mr Remy offered no defense of his accused son Jared, telling the gathered reporters: 'It’s pretty clear what is going to happen. He’s in jail. There’s no bail.'

He said that as a family they have tried to address his son's lifelong problems.

The sports caster, at times in tears during the 30-minute meeting, added: 'People told me that in time things would get better... Things have not gotten better... It became worse and worse.'

'But I’ve never been a quitter and I don’t intend to be one now.'

The beloved, veteran sports caster, 
who has battled cancer and depression, took himself out the public eye 
for months following the devastating blow to his family and the family of Miss Martel.

The 
network has always told Mr Remy that he was welcome back in his job at 
any time. He also said he feared that his decision to return to work will be viewed 
insensitive to the Martel family. 

Mr
 Remy told the press conference that he was unable to watch the Red Sox 
for the final six weeks of the regular season but did watch his team win
 the 2013 World Series.

Jared Remy's murder trial has been scheduled for October this year. He broke his silence during a court appearance last October to proclaim his 
innocence.

'No,' was Remy's blunt response when a Boston Herald reporter asked if he killed the mother of his daughter. 'That’s ridiculous.'

'How dumb would I
 have to be? I loved her, I still love her,' he said. The
 bulky 34-year-old maintains his innocence despite eyewitness accounts 
of Remy committing the murder. Police also reportedly dragged Remy from the murder scene covered in blood.

Remy's daughter has been in state custody since after the murder.

'She’s in a good place. She has a dog to play with, which makes me happy because she loves animals. I’m hoping she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' her father said.

Both Remy and Miss Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of the little girl.

He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars.

'If she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said.

While Remy admitted his past steroid abuse, he said he'd stopped using them. 'I wasn’t currently taking them,' he said.

Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother.

'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault. They don’t need to be dragged down in this, too,' he said.

At the time of the brutal murder, Jerry Remy said that
his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable. In a statement released through his Twitter account, Mr Remy said he and his wife were ‘heartbroken’ over the death of Miss Martel.

‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy
wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse
over this senseless and tragic act.’

On August 13 last year, police arrived at Jared Remy's home in the Windsor Village apartment complex
 at 9.30pm following multiple 911 calls. They found 
Martel bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds.

Middlesex
 Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Miss Martel in 
the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to 
the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly.

'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle'.

Remy was arrested at the scene after he held
 his hands over his head and surrendered to officers.

His clothing was 
soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an 
engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket.

Just
 feet away lay Miss Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab 
wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A 
blue cloth covered her face.

'There
 was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the 
victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was 
motionless, not breathing.'

Remy, who in 2005 
admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District 
Court just days before the murder on a domestic assault charge against Miss Martel. He was released without bail.

History: Remy was released from jail for assaulting Martel just two days before her murder

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend.

'She
 said, "I was planning my escape,"' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on
 Wednesday. She said, "Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape."'

Her mother is furious Remy was released after the assault and blames the blunder for her daughter's death.

'(Prosecutors) did not do their job,' Patty Martel said. 'They failed. She would be alive today if they had put him away.'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing.

'She
 went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' 
she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on 
him.'

At least one 
neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid 
and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved 
his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said.

'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.'

Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

Remy pleaded not guilty and 
has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter 
Bella, did not contest the bail order.

Police found Miss Martel dying from multiple stab wounds at the Windsor Village apartment complex in Waltham, Massachusetts last summer

Remy has maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of his girlfriend last year

'I've been in contact with the Remys. They are devastated, he said. 'This is a very sad and tragic day for two families.'

Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna.

'She
 had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on 
getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to
 marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would
 do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in 
the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it 
was this.'

She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter.

'I
 don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first
 thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his 
daughter for the rest of her life.'.

In 2009, Remy, then a security guard 
for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was 
fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he 
denied supplying steroids to his coworker.
