'Deeply offensive': Olly Grender, who incredibly claimed being in the House of Lords is 'unaffordable' to normal people because peers only get £300 a day

Serving in the House of Lords is ‘unaffordable’ for normal people because peers only get a tax-free allowance of £300 a day, a senior Liberal Democrat said last night.

Olly Grender, deputy chairman of Nick Clegg’s General Election team, said the lavish expenses paid to peers were too low to allow people to give up their jobs.

Critics last night said her comments would be ‘deeply offensive’ to millions of people earning far less.

But Baroness Grender, who was handed a peerage by Mr Clegg last year, complained that the irregular nature of payments from the House of Lords meant it was difficult to even get a mortgage.

Asked about the composition of the House of Lords, she told The House magazine: ‘What you don’t get is a hairdresser, what you don’t get is a bus driver. And why don’t you get those people? Because it’s unaffordable for most people to do this kind of thing unless you are relying on a partner.

‘A salary in the Lords alone, a bank won’t accept it as payment for a mortgage. It varies dramatically because you clock on when you sit - because it’s an allowance, rather than a salary.’

Members of the House of Lords are eligible for a tax-free allowance of £300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in. They are not required to speak in debates or vote, and do not have to stay all day.

Peers can claim a lower rate of £150 even if they are doing other paid work outside the Lords on the same day.

Official figures show that Lady Grender, a former PR executive and media pundit, attended the Lords on 81 days in her first six months and claimed £20,850 in attendance allowances in that time.

The allowances are equal to a pre-tax annual salary of just under £60,000 a year – more than two-and-a-half times the average annual salary for a full-time job in the UK.

By comparison, the Office for National Statistics’ 2012 salary survey found that the average hairdresser earns just over £10,000 a year, while the average bus driver earns less than £23,000.

Labour MP John Mann said Lady Grender’s comments showed she was ‘completely out of touch’.

Mr Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, in Nottinghamshire, said: ‘She is talking total, absolute nonsense. I could find plenty of hairdressers round here who would happily turn up to the House of Lords for £300 a day – they would be queuing up to do it.

‘It just shows she is part of an out-of-touch Westminster elite – many people will find her comments deeply offensive.’

Nice little earner: Members of the House of Lords are eligible for a tax-free allowance of £300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in. They are not required to speak in debates or vote, and do not have to stay all day

Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘A hairdresser or a bus driver would be delighted by a tax-free cheque of £300 a day. 

'The House of Lords doesn't sit full-time and there are plenty of peers who do additional jobs to top up their income. 

'It's comments like these that only serve to widen the perceived divide between Westminster and ordinary taxpayers.’

The expenses system in the Lords has been mired in controversy. Earlier this year the former Tory peer Lord Hanningfield was suspended from the Lords after he was caught on camera ‘clocking in’ for his £300 allowance and then leaving immediately for his home in Essex.

Dangerous place: Lady Grender also revealed she has been the victim of sexual harassment at Westminster

Meanwhile, Lady Grender also became the latest Lib Dem woman to reveal she has been the victim of sexual harassment at Westminster.

Asked if she had suffered unwanted sexual advances, she said: ‘Yes, from an MP, who’s now dead. When I first started working in Parliament in my early 20s, I would say that I had no idea I could complain that I was being sexually harassed by somebody who was a Member of Parliament. It just didn’t even occur to me. And I’m really pleased it now occurs to people.’

Lady Grender said the scandal caused by allegations of sexual harassment against former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard had cast a ‘dark cloud’ over the party.

She added: ‘I think it’s been damaging and divisive in the party, but I think we are where we are and we all need to just move on.’
