It is estimated that around 8,000 people are killed by landslides every year, while many others narrowly escape the terrifying ordeal.

But now a new way of predicting landslides has been developed – and it uses a system of fibre optic sensors to act as the ‘nervous system’ of slopes.

The technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes and could be used over large areas to detect potential landslides before they threaten people’s lives and livelihoods.

Optical fibre sensors are commonly used to monitor the condition of infrastructure such as the exterior walls of tunnels, dams, pipelines and railways in remote rural areas, which are difficult for humans to observe. 

In this case they can be used as the sensing element, but can also be used as a means of relaying signals from a remote sensor to the electronics that process the signals. 

The fibres can measure strain, temperature or pressure so that the quality being measured - movement for example, - varies the intensity, wavelength or transit time of the light in the fibre.

Now, Italian researchers have embedded optical fibre sensors in shallow trenches within slopes to detect and monitor both large landslides and slow slope movements.

Landslides are a collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a mountain or cliff and are always preceded by ‘pre-failure strains, the researchers from the Second University of Naples said.

They have now been proved to be effective when embedded in slopes, where they can monitor movement of soil. A stock images of fibre is shown

Landslides are described as the mass movement of rock, soil or debris down a slope of land. They can destroy houses and bury people in seconds with little or no warning.

Landslides are thought to have increased in frequency because of human activity, which causes the 'failure' of soil or rock that make up a hillside.

Earthquakes: Plate tectonics move the soil that covers them, so when earthquakes strike on or near steep slopes, it is common for soil to slip and trigger landslides, according to the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire.

Natural disasters: Volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are among the natural events that can cause landslides.

Heavy rainfall: Slopes can become saturated with rainfall, causing landslides. This risk increases if trees have been cleared because there is no network of roots to support the soil, which simply washes away. 

Earlier this month, a landslide in Maharashtra state, India was caused by monsoons, leaving 17 people dead and many more trapped. In August, more than 40 people were killed when huge landslides in Hiroshima, Japan, destroyed homes when mountainsides collapsed in wet weather and tonnes of mud buried people living in the suburban neighbourhoods below.

Mining: Blasting techniques can cause vibrations under the soil, which can trigger landslides. The Gyama Mine Landslide occurred in 2013 and trapped 83 people in China. It was one-and-a-half miles (3km) long.

While the magnitude of pre-failure strains depends on the rock or soil involved, they are measurable. 

The new technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes, and can therefore detect the onset of landslides.

Electrical sensors have been used for monitoring landslides, but they are easily damaged, unlike optical fibre sensors which are more robust, economical and sensitive.

Professor Luigi Zeni, of the university, said: ‘Distributed optical fibre sensors can act as a “nervous system” of slopes by measuring the tensile strain of the soil they’re embedded within.’

He explained that his team have combined several types of optical fibre sensors housed in a plastic tube, which can move under the force of pre-failure strains.

Using the technology, experts will be able to monitor the movement and bending of the optical fibre remotely to determine if a landslide is imminent.

Professor Zeni said that the use of the fibre optic sensors overcomes limitations of other types of sensor because they have no moving parts and ‘can withstand larger soil deformations’.

‘These sensors can be used to cover very large areas - several square kilometres - and interrogated in a time-continuous way to pinpoint any critical zones,’ he added.

He believes that based on tests so far, the technology has the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to develop early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock.

A major landslide can completely erase houses within seconds, as well as wiping out families and communities. The researchers hope that their invention will prevent loss of life just as hurricane tracking can prompt coastal evacuations and save lives.

The findings of the initial test will be presented at The Optical Society’s annual meeting, Frontiers in Optics, in California next month.

Here,the remains of a house can be seen after a mudslide near Oso in Washington State this March, when 43 people lost their lives when a portion of an unstable hill collapsed

Based on tests so far, the reseracers behind the technology think ithas the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to create early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock. Here, rescue workers look for missing people after the Oso landslide in Washington state, US
