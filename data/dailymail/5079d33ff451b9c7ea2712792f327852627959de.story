After two triumphant trips to Wembley in 2014 and promotion to the Football League after a nine-year exile, Cambridge United chairman Dave Doggett had fixed his hopes for the New Year on something a little more mundane.

He would settle for a solid season in League Two with perhaps a small sign of progress in the quest to build a new stadium.

Then they were drawn at home to Manchester United and Doggett, like many fellow Cambridge fans, spent the day in a daze, snuggling into the warm embrace of the FA Cup, a competition which in its modern guise promises financial reassurances besides the traditional romance.

'Last year was incredible,' said Doggett. 'To be sat in the Royal Box at Wembley twice last year, felt good. It's only a couple of years since we were losing £25,000-£30,000 a month, and we've come through it all on a reasonably stable footing.

'We thought 2015 might be a time for consolidation, nothing too spectacular. Then, we're drawn against one of the top club teams in the world.'

Doggett was in the BBC Radio Cambridgeshire studios, on Monday, along with manager Richard Money, previous chairman Paul Barry and director Colin Proctor for the fourth-round draw. They were the third team out of the hat. United were next. 

'I don't think we saw the rest of it,' he admitted.

Three television crews descended on the R Costings Abbey Stadium and the phones went wild with ticket enquiries. 

The tie is certain to be the BBC's first pick for live broadcast, which guarantees Cambridge a windfall from the FA of £234,000 in prize money and television payments.

It is an incredible boost for a club with a wage bill of £1.25m per year - roughly what Wayne Rooney earns in five weeks - and which has teetered often on the brink of extinction during a decade of turmoil.

AFC Wimbledon's live third-round tie against Liverpool on Monday drew a BBC audience of 6.5million, Manchester United, at Yeovil on Sunday, drew 1.3m on BT Sport. 

This tie will remind the world that Cambridge United is alive and kicking – and that is largely thanks to its fans.

The club has always led an up-and-down existence. Elected to the Football League in 1970, they went up to the second tier with help from Ron Atkinson and back to the fourth before John Beck took them to the brink of the Premier League in its inaugural season.

Cambridge reached the FA Cup quarter-finals twice, in 1990 and 1991, and finished fifth in Division Two in 1992. They were six points from automatic promotion and were beaten in the play-offs by Leicester.

This proved to be the high watermark before a steady decline turned serious soon after the turn of the millennium. In 2005, Cambridge were relegated from the Football League and forced to sell the Abbey Stadium as they were plunged into administration.

The sale of the ground for £1.92m to director John Howard and his business partner Stephen Clark saved the club in the short term but would haunt it for years. Rent bills had a crippling impact on finances and a bitter struggle erupted inside the club until Howard sold the ground to the current landlords Grosvenor Estates for £3.5m.

Proctor was among those who made sacrifices to save the club. The 76-year-old, a fan for more than 70 years, sold his entire collection of memorabilia – programmes, shirts and autographs dating back to 1947 and valued at more than £35,000 - for £10,000 to raise instant cash, and gave every penny to the club's administrators.

'We were in a position where we needed £10,000, just to get through the weekend,' he said. 'We've been close to the edge many times. We've suffered and without the loyal supporters who have stood shoulder to shoulder, this fantastic club wouldn't be here. There would be houses here instead.

'Dave Doggett has put megabucks in. So did his predecessor Paul Barry. These people have put their hands in their pockets.'

Fans pitched in with volunteer work: manning tea bars, answering phones, selling tickets and tending the pitch to keep it going and the Cambridge Fans United have grown to play an influential role during the recovery years.

Money took over as manager in 2012, replacing Jez George, a former youth team coach, who had stepped up when the club couldn't afford to appoint anyone else. He was in charge for nearly two years and is now the director of football.

Cambridge clinched promotion to League Two via the play-offs and also won the FA Trophy last year, but the visit of Manchester United will eclipse that, certainly in terms of exposure.

'I feel like a 30-year-old again,' said Proctor. 'I took a call at 3.30am from a friend in the USA who forgot the time difference but had heard about the draw. I couldn't get back to sleep and I've spent the whole day at the club. It's been full of people after tickets that don't go on sale until Monday.'

First though, to Carlisle this Saturday, for something a little more mundane.
