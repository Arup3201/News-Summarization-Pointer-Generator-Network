Politicians raced to declare their love for bingo yesterday as a political row continued to rage about the Tories patronising the working classes.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Chancellor George Osborne and Tory chairman Grant Shapps all let it be known that they liked calling ‘House!’ – and not just in the Commons.

Mr Osborne halved bingo tax from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in the Budget this week, and knocked 1p off a pint of beer.

Chancellor George Osborne says he not only plays bingo, but sometimes calls the numbers, but Nick Clegg admitted he had not gone eyes down for a decade

The move to cut bingo tax in the Budget saw internet spoofs about the Cabinet's level of interest in the game, including this one from Joel Benjamin posted on Twitter

But his efforts to woo blue-collar  
workers were undermined when Mr Shapps tweeted an advert which read: 
‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people 
do more of the things they enjoy.’

‘they’
 was widely  dismissed as patronising and  further evidence that the 
Conservatives are out of touch with many less well-off voters.

t was later parodied online in numerous spoofs.

rday sought to redeem himself, insisting that  he too enjoyed the pleasure of a pint and an evening spent spotting  the numbers.

On
 a visit to Carlisle, he told the BBC: ‘I drink beer and I love a game 
of bingo.’ The Tory chairman dismissed the row as controversy whipped up
 by the Labour Party.

Nick Clegg said he used to play bingo when living in Nottingham a decade ago, most likely at Beacon Bingo in Loughborough

He 
spoke out after Mr Clegg told the Western Morning News that he used to 
enjoy the game – but hadn’t played for a decade or more.

‘Not
 for years,’ he said, ‘when I was living in Nottingham. There was a 
bingo hall there – I’m not sure if it’s still there – in Loughborough.’

Mr
 Clegg lived in the Nottinghamshire village of Ruddington when he was 
the MEP for the East  Midlands, but stood down in 2004. He said the Tory
 advert was ‘silly’ because it overshadowed important measures in the 
Budget.

'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget - which spawned numerous spoofs online

A Tory party advert promoting a beer and bingo tax cut was condemned by Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Speaking at a conference in Scotland, Mr Miliband said: 'What about that advert that they released?

'Have you seen a more condescending, patronising, arrogant, haughty, out-of-touch, misconceived piece of nonsense?

'And didn’t the mask slip? The “hardworking people of Britain”. The Conservatives say “they”. We say “us”.

'We are the party of the hardworking people of every part of our United Kingdom.'

But he added: ‘I 
think it’s very good that we’re letting people know we’re helping the 
bingo industry – that was decimated under the last Labour government – 
the pub industry and the brewing industry. These are important measures;
 by the way these industries employ many thousands of people, but they 
weren’t the only things in the budget.’

Mr
 Osborne confessed on Thursday that he had played several times. Asked 
on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he had ever played bingo, he said: ‘Yes I 
have.’

One
 said: ‘He has played and called. He was a happy participant’. David 
Cameron yesterday dodged questions about whether he was a fan of bingo.

He
 told a press conference in Brussels: ‘The issue here is trying to make 
sure there are fair taxes. I think bingo wasn’t taxed fairly and I’m 
very pleased that we’ve managed to cut the tax on bingo.’

Downing
 Street refused to say if Mr Cameron had ever played bingo. The Prime 
Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘I still haven’t had the opportunity
 to ask him. I haven’t asked him about bingo at all.’ Pressed on whether he would give details later on Mr Cameron’s bingo habits, he replied: ‘I think I may disappoint you.’

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband used a speech in Scotland to condemn the Tory advert
 and the cut in bingo tax. He said it ‘won’t go to the  people playing 
bingo, it’s going to go to the bingo companies’.

And
 he added: “Did you see that advert? Have you ever seen a more 
condescending, patronising, haughty, complacent, out-of-touch, 
misconceived piece of nonsense?’
