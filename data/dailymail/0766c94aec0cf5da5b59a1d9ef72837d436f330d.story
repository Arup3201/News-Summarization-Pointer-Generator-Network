Taking action: Energy minister Greg Barker wants energy companies to pay

Energy companies are to be summoned to Downing Street and ordered to return millions of pounds to customers who have overpaid bills through direct debits.

Ministers will react to growing public outrage over inflation-busting charges by telling the power giants to stop stockpiling more than £2 billion from households.

The companies will be told that if they don’t return the money – or pay back the estimated £36 million a year that the cash pile earns in interest – they will face fines.

Energy Minister Greg Barker said consumers would be ‘outraged’ that  companies such as British Gas and EDF boost their revenues by holding on to customers’ cash.

Mr Barker said: ‘Customers will rightly feel outraged that they signed up to direct debit payments for cheap tariffs but instead find their cash stockpiled.

‘We need to stamp this out now and energy firms must come clean on how much cash they are sitting on. If we find serious abuse, rest assured we will come down on them like a ton of bricks.’

He is expected to point to smaller energy firms – such as Ovo Energy, which offers an annual rate of up to three per cent on credits – and tell the ‘big-six’ companies that they should do likewise.

The companies will also be asked to sign up to a code of practice, which will impose strict conditions on the use of customers’ surplus cash.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are becoming increasingly concerned about the problem. If the energy companies are unable to resolve the issue, the regulator, Ofgem, will be asked to investigate and potentially impose fines.’

The average annual dual energy bill is now nearly £1,500 – with figures from Ofgem showing that, since 2001, gas bills have risen by 137 per cent and electricity by 66 per cent.

Ofgem
 has confirmed that millions of customers who switched to a direct debit
 payment system to secure a cheaper tariff have been overcharged. And 
the consumer group Which? says the energy giants enjoy a £1.2 billion 
‘surplus’ each year from customers who are in credit – which they are 
then free to invest for an annual return of up to three per cent.

Industry experts believe the figure is now closer to £2 billion, as the research was based on 2012 data. 

Mark
 Todd, of switching site energyhelpline, said: ‘We think that about 20 
million households are now on direct debit and from our experience the 
average credit is conservatively about £100 on each bill.

Energy Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This is about big businesses profiteering'

‘That’s £2 billion being held. We think it is scandalous and Ofgem should do something about it.’

As
 a condition of the Gas and Electricity Supply Licence, credits must be 
refunded if asked for by the customer – but only 13 per cent of 
consumers had made the request.

Mr
 Barker added: ‘Ofgem has already acted to tighten up abuse of direct 
debits – but we will be holding very frank discussions with the  big-six
 to make sure all consumers get a fair deal.’

Energy
 Secretary Michael Fallon added: ‘This is about big businesses 
profiteering. We have ordered Ofgem to ensure direct debits are accurate
 and are refunded. Ofgem needs to get tougher. Companies are banking 
with consumers’ money and customers are being taken for a ride.’

An
 Ofgem spokesman said: ‘If any customers are concerned about direct 
debit payments they should complain to their supplier – and if the 
complaint is not resolved they can ask the independent Energy Ombudsman 
to examine it for them.’

An npower spokesman said: ‘We automatically refund any customer with over £60 credit at this time.’

A
 Scottish Power spokesman said: ‘Scottish Power will pay a customer £1 
for every full multiple of £33 above a minimum credit value of £100 – to
 the maximum pay-out of £12 for a credit balance of £496.’

An
 SSE spokesman said: ‘If customers are more than £100 in credit, we 
automatically refund the credit back to their bank account.”

A
 British Gas spokesman said: ‘The amount of time customers are in debit 
far outweighs the amount of time customers are in credit.’

An EDF spokesman said: ‘Monthly direct debits are the cheapest way for people to pay their bills.’

E.ON did not respond to requests for information.
