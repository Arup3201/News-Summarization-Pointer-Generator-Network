Paul Scholes has rubbished the idea of Raheem Sterling needing extended periods of rest after games.

Sterling sat out the majority of England's 1-0 win in Estonia on Sunday after complaining of tiredness.

The mercurial winger's boss at Liverpool Brendan Rodgers has been on a collision course with England manager Roy Hodgson over his use of Sterling.

Fellow England international Jordan Henderson drove Sterling into training at Liverpool on Tuesday 

But former Three Lions midfielder Scholes believes the Anfield star should be fine to play games in quick succession, pointing to his experience while training with Manchester United.

'If you are 19 years old like Raheem Sterling, or even 25 years old like Daniel Sturridge, you do not need a two-day recovery after playing a game, said Scholes in his column for the Independent.

'The “two-day recovery” concept was introduced at Manchester United during my time there by the fitness coach Tony Strudwick, who also works with England. Tony knows how to look after players.

Sterling came on in the second-half and made an impact, winning the free-kick for Wayne Rooney's winner

'The two-day recovery was only for the oldest among us, generally speaking the over-33s.

'The second day after a game, the likes of myself, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs would do some strides across the pitch, stretch for 20 minutes and go back in for a massage. The rest of the squad would train as normal.'

Scholes, however, does not blame Hodgson for Sterling's set-back, rather pressure from Liverpool.

He continued: 'That injury to Sturridge was not Hodgson’s fault. It could have happened to any player from any club. 

'What has created the problem has been Rodgers complaining about the two-day recovery process in the aftermath of the injury.'

Hodgson's side sit top of Group E with three wins from three matches, having yet to concede a goal.
