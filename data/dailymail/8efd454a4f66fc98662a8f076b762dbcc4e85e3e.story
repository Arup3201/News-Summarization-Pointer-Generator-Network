Arsenal target Alvaro Morata has passed his medical after flying to Italy to complete a move to Juventus from Real Madrid.

Arsene Wenger was keeping close tabs on Morata as he looks to bolster his forward options ahead of the new season, however Juventus have beaten Arsenal to the Spaniard's signature.

Hot prospect: The 21-year-old striker was prolific for Spain throughout his youth career

Morata has decided to leave Real Madrid in order to secure regular first-team football.

'Juve are one of the best clubs in the world, and the best in Italy,' said Morata.

'I am keen to contribute to the pursuit of further success.

'I've spoken to Allegri and I have a strong desire to get to work.

'I've wanted to play for Juve for a long time and the club have always shown a strong interest in me.

'I feel ready. I know it will be hard, but I'm ready to tackle Serie A head on.'

The 21-year-old started just three games in La Liga last season as he was behind the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema in Real Madrid's pecking order.

Former Juventus boss Antonio Conte was keen on bringing Morata to Turin before he decided to resign from his post at the Juventus Stadium.

However Juventus' plans to bring in both Morata and Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra have not been dashed as new boss Massimiliano Allegri is keen on working with the duo.
