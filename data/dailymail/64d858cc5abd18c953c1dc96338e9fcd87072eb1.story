In news that will come as no surprise to many long-suffering British women, fashion, dancing and multitasking have been named as the skills British men are worst at.

New research out today found men are also woeful at remembering significant dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, carrying out most domestic chores and buying clothes for a partner.

They also lack skill at buying gifts in general, picking home furniture and cooking more complicated dishes.

While some British men think they have the 'moves like Jagger' or the fashion sense of a young Versace, many more are less confident

Researchers said the findings showed modern men still rely on women to do the majority of chores and tasks that should involve both partners in a relationship.

However, it seems men can be relied upon to hurt themselves doing DIY, buy wrong size clothes for a partner and get drunk at a family function.

They are also more likely than women to miss a flight after sleeping in, forget to pick up children from school or an event, forget an anniversary or birthday and miss work because of a hangover.

The survey of 1,000 adults was commissioned by sauce brand Frank’s Red Hot for the launch of its pop-up men’s skill schools in London and Manchester, in which experts will pass on tips on everything from dancing to fashion to remembering key dates.

The poll found 36 per cent of men believe they lack cooking skills, 38 per cent think they are bad at dancing and 36 per cent think they are terrible when it comes to public speaking.

Perhaps surprisingly, 35 per cent of men thought they were no good at DIY, while 21 per cent did not rate their chances on the sports field.

Not only do British men struggle to remember significant dates, they also lack skills in buying present

Men also rated themselves low when it comes to buying gifts for a loved one (52 per cent), remembering birthdays or anniversaries (33 per cent) and doing domestic chores (30 per cent).

1 Buying clothes for partner 52%

2 Remembering anniversary/birthday 41%

3 Dancing 33%

4 Ironing 31%

5 Cooking 30%

6 Domestic chores 30%

7 Buying gifts 28%

8 Multitasking 22%

9 Keeping up with fashion 22%

10 Picking furniture 21%

In fact, the only skills that men rate themselves as better than women at are killing insects, changing a car tyre and putting up shelves.

They also rate themselves better in the gender stakes at playing video games, barbequing and playing sport.

Both sexes agree that men are generally better at some things - such as telling jokes, tying a bow tie, fixing computer problems and eating spicy food.

However, there is only a slim chance that men will improve in the gender race - three in four (76 per cent) say they are “good enough at the skills they care about”.

It’s bad news for the opposite sex, with nearly one in 10 (nine per cent) of women desperately wishing their partner was better at a range of skills.

Four in 10 (43 per cent) of all the survey respondents thought men were generally worse than women at many life skills, while a third (32 per cent) said today’s men are no better than their fathers at certain skills.

A spokesman for Frank’s Red Hot said: 'Our research shows many men are lacking in skills which women seem to have grasped.

'In fact, time seems to have stood still for many men when it comes to skills like ironing, shopping, multitasking and keeping up with fashion.

'We hope this research is a rude awakening to those millions of men who still rely on their partners for a variety of skills round the home.'
