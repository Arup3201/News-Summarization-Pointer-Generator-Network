Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is on the verge of being dropped as Poland’s No 1 goalkeeper after being relegated to the bench by his club.

Poland manager Adam Nawalka has visited England to watch Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc play and was on a scouting mission at their 2-0 win against Watford less than two weeks ago.

Nawalka met Boruc, who is on loan from Southampton, before that match and told him Szczesny’s place in the national team is up for grabs while he is on the bench at Arsenal.

Szczesny was dropped after a series of poor performances was compounded by the smoking incident 

Szczesny has fallen behind David Ospina after a host of errors and then angering Arsene Wenger for smoking in the showers after their 2-0 defeat to Southampton at St Mary’s.

Ospina has begun to make Arsenal’s No 1 spot his own with a string of strong displays, conceding just three goals in six games - including four clean sheets - since replacing Szczesny at the beginning of January.

Since that match against Southampton Szczesny has played just once, in their FA Cup win against Brighton when he conceded two goals.

Boruc has won 59 caps for Poland but fell behind Szczesny, who has 22 caps, when he became Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper.

The 34-year-old is determined to win his place back in the national side, as players who reach 60 caps go into a Polish half of fame.

Boruc decided on the loan move further along the south coast after falling out of favour at Southampton when they signed Fraser Forster for £10m from Celtic.

Before that he was their regular goalkeeper since moving to the club from Fiorentina in 2012.
