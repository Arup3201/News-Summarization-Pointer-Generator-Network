Kris Boyd has insisted that even Jose Mourinho himself would have struggled to change Rangers’ fortunes if he were in charge at Ibrox.

After their dismal 1-1 draw at home to Livingston on Saturday, the Govan club languish in third position in the Championship table – 24 points behind runaway leaders Hearts – and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end-of-season play-offs.

However, Boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season, the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check – before they end up costing yet another man his job.

Boyd said it would not matter if Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (pictured) was in charge at Ibrox 

‘We’re now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players,’ said Boyd, ahead of Rangers’ league meeting with Alloa on Tuesday night at Ibrox. ‘It doesn’t matter if you were to go and bring in Jose Mourinho – he would still have the same players to deal with.

‘Sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye. But, ultimately, it’s the same players going out on the pitch and if we’re being brutally honest, it’s us who need to get a grip.

‘We can sit and say we’ve got international players in the dressing room but, at the end of the day, we haven’t performed and two managers have lost their job because of that, so we need to start winning games of football.

‘It can’t be all the manager’s fault. That’s why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough. I can safely say that I don’t feel as if I have. And I’m willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing.

‘We have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip. You can blame all different aspects - but it’s only excuses. We haven’t performed on the pitch and that’s the bottom line.’

After admitting recently that his second spell at Ibrox had been a failure on a personal level, with only three league goals to his name, Boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club.

And he believes that due to their current malaise, the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting Ibrox.

He added: ‘I’ve been in the situation myself when you turn up at Ibrox or Parkhead and you’re already beaten. They might have won 4-0 or 5-0 the week before and you look around you and think: “Oh no”.

‘But that’s not the case any more. Teams are coming with confidence and have seen that we’ve been weak. Previously, it was only European teams who didn’t change their game for Rangers - but teams now aren’t worrying about us.

‘Livingston came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply. They deserved their point. They might have lost five games previously, but they probably looked at us as being weak and tried to get in our faces.’
