This truck driver is lucky to be alive after he was left hanging precariously  upside down off when his lorry flipped, landing on the edge of a bridge.

Driver Dong Yinan was thrown from the truck’s cab when his heavy vehicle crashed through bridge barricades and flipped while travelling through Xuanma town in China’s Gansu province.

With his right leg wedged between the 
truck and the bridge, Mr Yinan’s lucky landing saved him from a deadly fall to the ground, 30 feet below.

Passers-by looked on as Mr Yinan flailed as he hung on to ropes with his legs split in midair.

The truck, carrying 30 tons of coal, threatened to topple over the edge leaving Mr Yinan holding on for dear life.

Risky rescue: It took firefighters three hours to free Mr Yinan who is now recovering in hospital

Firefighters had the tricky task of reaching him safely from under the teetering truck.

It took them three hours to rescue the driver who is now recovering in hospital.

The accident comes as the safety of trucks on Chinese roads was questioned following a heavy duty truck carrying construction materials overturned while turning at an intersection in Beijing on Sunday morning.

Tons of soil spilled out onto the road, covering and killing a female cyclist.

Transport experts have put the spotlight on heavy duty trucks saying these types of accidents are all too common.
