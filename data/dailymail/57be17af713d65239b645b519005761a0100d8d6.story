A bride has lost an incredible six stone and four dress sizes after seeing her herself as a 'fat little cake topper' on her wedding cake.

Valerie McLean, 25, from Glasgow, vowed to slim down from 17 stone when she saw her shape reflected in the miniature marzipan form.

'I'd been big for most of my life and planning my wedding was another painful reminder,' said Valerie, an IT manager.

'The fat little cake topper' that prompted Valerie McLean to lose weight

'The fat little cake topper just summed me up.

'I even grew between picking my wedding dress and picking it up. I was a size 16, but by the time I got the dress I'd become a size 18.

'I just couldn't get into it and burst into tears. I didn't realise I'd let my weight get so bad and thought I would look back on my wedding photographs in shame.'

The shop ordered a replacement dress and the wedding went ahead in May 2012.

'I pushed my weight worries to the back of my mind and made it a wonderful day,' she added.

Valerie joined Slimming World after a pal lost half a stone in two weeks.

The newlywed was shocked to discover she tipped the scales at 17 stone and was on track to develop health problems like diabetes.

'I was stunned and vowed to reach a healthy weight as soon as possible.'

Using her club's eating plan she reached 10 and a half stone last week and has just five more pounds to shed to achieve her dream weight.

Part of her success was a stray dog, Evan, which she and husband Grant, 32, gave a home to after seeing him at the Dogs Trust charity.

She calls him her 'calorie burner' as she walks him three times a day.

As the weight fell off, old friends struggled to recognise her - with one even thinking Grant had a new woman.

'We picked up one of his friends to go to football training and he called Grant to ask who his new girl was,' says Valerie.

Now a slim size 10, she wants to inspire others to lose weight like she has.

Valerie has started her own weight loss class in the Swallow Hotel on Paisley Road West, Glasgow.

'I realise how miserable people feel when nothing fits but dull shapeless clothes,' she added.

'Trendy fashion stores didn't stock my size.'

'I'm on a mission to help others lose unwanted and unhealthy stones.'
