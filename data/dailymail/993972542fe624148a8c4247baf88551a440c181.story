Two schoolgirls  have described their dramatic rescue after almost being buried alive when a beach cliff collapsed.

Three men had to use their hands to desperately claw Abigail Thomas, 12, and Jodie Leach, nine, from the sand.

The girls were digging a hole at the base of the cliff when up to 30 tonnes of sand started to slide away from the top.

The pair tried to run away, but Jodie tripped and was buried up to her neck by the landslide at Hemsby beach, Norfolk.

Abigail said: 'We ran away and Jodie fell over.
I went back to help her and I fell over as well.

'We
were screaming because we were totally stuck. Jodie was up to her neck 
and I was up to my chest.

'We thought that more sand might come down and 
kill us. The men had to dig under us to pull us out. It was really hurting us.'

The girls’ screams alerted a man and a woman who were walking on the beach and they rushed over to help.

The man and another passer-by frantically started digging the girls out with their hands as Abigail’s sister Jessica, nine, watched in horror.

A boy who was with the couple ran to fetch retired fisherman Kenny Chaney, 66, who was metal detecting around 150 yards away.

Mr Chaney of Hemsby helped the two other men scoop the sand away as the woman dialled 999 to alert coastguards, firefighters and paramedics.

The trio faced the possibility of being buried themselves if there was a second landslide, but they carried on digging and pulled the girls out in ten minutes.

Jodie’s brother Jake, 12, ran quarter of a mile so he could get help from his parents Chris, 40, and Natasha, 39, who were at the nearby Long Beach caravan park.

Mr Leach, a sales manager, and Abigail’s father Allan Thomas, 45, an electrician ran to the beach to find that their daughters had already been pulled out by Mr Chaney and the two other rescuers.

The girls who suffered only minor injuries were taken to the James Paget Hospital at Gorleston near Great Yarmouth.

Jodie was given oxygen by paramedics as she had breathed in sand.

Abigail had a suspected broken ankle, but an X-ray revealed she had only suffered a bad sprain.

The drama happened just after 12.30pm on Good Friday when the girls and their families who are both from Kedington, Suffolk, were on the first day of an Easter break in their touring caravans.

Jodie added: 'It was such a relief to get out. We want to thank the people who helped us.'
