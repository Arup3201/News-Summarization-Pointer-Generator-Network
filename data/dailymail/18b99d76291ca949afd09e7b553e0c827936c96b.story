Nannies have played an important role in the Royal household for generations.

Prince William was so attached to his nanny Olga Powell, who was at his side throughout his childhood, that he cancelled four high-profile engagements to be at her funeral earlier this year.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to break with royal tradition by not employing a full-time nanny.

The couple are determined to be 'hands-on parents' and Kate is planning to look after her child without the help of someone 24 hours a day.

Kate and Wills may 
employ a part-time nanny who will fulfill the role as a 'babysitter' by 
looking after their baby when they have to attend events.

But Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton will also be there to lend a hand as much as possible.

One of the couple's friends said: 'Catherine and William are 
determined to be hands-on parents.'

'Her parents are very excited about the baby and will help out
as much as possible.'

'They will, probably, use a part-time 
nanny to help them out when they have to attend events and don’t have a 
babysitter, but they don’t want a full-time nanny.'

Their decision not to employ a full-time nanny will be a major break with royal tradition.

But it is not first time the royal couple have decided to forgo the services of full-time help.

The couple do not employ any staff at their home in North Wales, where the Duke serves as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot at Anglesey, apart from a cleaner who visits weekly.

Kate has spoken of how she enjoys doing the cooking and household chores.

In contrast, Kate Middleton was cared for by her mother Carole, pictured together in 1982, and did not have a full-time nanny

And at university William and his housemates took it in turns to do the cooking and shared household chores - including shopping for food.

The Duke of Cambridge's nannies played such an important role in his life that the son of one of them, Tom Pettifer, was a page boy at the royal wedding.

Tom, William's godson, is the youngest son of Alexandra Shân 'Tiggy' 
Pettifer, known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was hired as a nanny to Harry and William
after Charles and Diana announced their separation.

Tiggy
helped comfort the princes after their mother's death in 1997. She was so close to the boys after their parents’ divorce that she, memorably,
once described them as 'my babies'.

She retired from the Prince of Wales's service when she married in October 
1999.

In October, William attended the private funeral of his former nanny Olga Powell, cancelling four high-profile engagements in the north east, which his wife had to attend alone.

Mrs Powell was at his side through both childhood and the most important days in his adult life.

The loving, but strict nanny, was widely credited for having a massive impact on the lives of both Prince William and Harry as they were growing up.

Mrs Powell, who was widowed after just six years of marriage when she was 52, came to work for Princess Diana when Prince William was just six months old.

Although very loving, she was renowned for not taking any nonsense from the young boys, and famously would give them a clip around the ear if they were ever naughty.

Another nanny, Barbara Barnes, was sacked by Diana when William was four because she envied their strong bond.

In world's apart, Kate Middleton was brought up by her mother, Carole, a former air stewardess who spent her early years in a council flat in Southall, an unfashionable London suburb.

The woman considered to be most influential in the Prince of Wales's life was his beloved nanny Mabel Anderson, employed by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to care for their four children.

She had such a special place in the hearts of the Royal family that she was called upon to represent the Duke of York at a funeral at the Chapel 
Royal, in St James’s Palace, earlier this year.

Mabel's 80th birthday party was arranged by Charles to take place at the royal residence, Clarence House.

When she retired, Charles secured her a lifelong grace-and-favour home in a wing of Frogmore House, Windsor Great Park, and personally supervised its re-decoration using his own designer.

Mabel, who was once described by the Prince of Wales as 'a haven of security, the great haven', was said to be a great friend of the Queen's.

The Queen met Mabel, a policeman's daughter from Elgin,
Scotland, in 1949 after she replied to an advertisement, not
knowing it was from the royal household.

It was to be an assistant nanny to help the then Princess
Elizabeth who was pregnant with Charles.

Despite her lack of formal
training, Mabel, at 22, was chosen by the future Queen because Her
Majesty liked her quiet, unassuming manner.

It was Mabel who put the children to bed, told them stories,
patched up their cuts and bruises and hit upon the idea of teaching
the royal corgis hide and seek with Princess Anne so that she
wouldn't miss Charles when he started school.

She even sent Charles bottles of Vosene shampoo for his dandruff
at boarding school.

Each 
Christmas, Prince Charles sends a chauffeur-driven car to take Mrs 
Anderson 
to Sandringham, where she is treated like a cherished member of the 
family rather than an employee.

A St James’s Palace spokesman said: 'It is too early to say whether the Duke and Duchess will employ a nanny.'

The news comes as it was revealed by the Mail on Sunday the couple are considering skipping Christmas at Sandringham and may instead spend December 25 with Kate’s parents Carole and Michael.

‘It is being discussed but has not yet been decided,’ said a source.

‘Carole is keen for Kate to spend Christmas with the family. It will be their last Christmas at the family home before the Middletons move house.

‘At home Kate will be able to relax and put her feet up. Christmas at Sandringham can be very busy and stressful with everyone arriving. There is always lots going on, big dinners and lots of outfit changes to contend with.’

The family have reportedly bought a £4.7 million, seven-bedroom mansion.
