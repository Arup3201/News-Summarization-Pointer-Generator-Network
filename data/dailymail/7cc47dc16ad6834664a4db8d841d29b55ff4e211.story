Villagers in Russia are mourning the death of a child who was killed when an automatic gate closed crushing him to death. 

The accident happened in the tiny hamlet of Proskurka near Novgorod as four-year-old Vanya Mihanokov was playing near the factory where his mother worked.

The automatic gate separated his family's wood processing business from the road outside.

Worker Vassily Malenko said: 'Everybody here liked Vanya. He was a sweet little boy with a cheeky smile and a polite word for all. He was a real joy-bringer.

'The gate was just an adventure for him. He was fascinated by the silent electric mechanism that would make it slide open and shut and would often sit and stare at it for hours.

'But on this day he got bored riding his bike around the yard and rushed over to sit on the gate when he saw it moving. His mother Lioudmila, who was working inside, thought he was safe.

'There was a colleague there anyway but he missed the boy climbing on the gate as it was beginning to move, the boy wanted to get off, but his jacket was caught.

'He was struggling, he couldn't free himself and then his tiny body was crushed in the closing mechanism.'

The other employee even then did not see what happened as he was playing with a dog.

When he realised, the boy's mother and staff rushed to the scene but it was already too late. Vanya was declared dead at the scene.
