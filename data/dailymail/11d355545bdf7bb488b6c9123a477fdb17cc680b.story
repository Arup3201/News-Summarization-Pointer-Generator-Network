West Ham are poised to win the battle for Arsenal right-back Carl Jenkinson.

The 22-year-old will be allowed out on loan following the arrival of Calum Chambers from Southampton and Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle.

Hull City had made a concerted effort to sign the England international but denied making a formal £3million proposal once it became clear the player wanted to stay in London.

Swansea and Sunderland have also shown an interest but Swansea are focusing on Kyle Naughton of Tottenham.

West Ham are intensifying their search for a striker and want another centre back and a left-back.

Cardiff City's Fabio and Declan John have been discussed as possibles for the left-back berth to give competition to Aaron Cresswell.
