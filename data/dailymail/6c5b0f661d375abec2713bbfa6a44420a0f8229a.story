Smoking could be phased out in 2018 in Tasmania for young Australians

A generation of Australians could be on the brink of living a tobacco-free existence if a move to ban the sale of cigarettes to young people is successful.

The 'tobacco-free' generation bill is set to be introduced into Tasmanian parliament this year, which would make it illegal for people born after the year 2000 to buy cigarettes and for retailers to sell tobacco-laced products to them.

The law would come into effect in 2018 and would mean people aged 14 this year would not be able to buy cigarettes once they turn 18.

Harsh penalties would also be imposed on anyone caught supplying tobacco to the 'tobacco-free generation' whether they're a retailer or an individual.

Tasmanian Independent Member of the Legislative Council Ivan Dean is the brains behind the idea and will put the motion to the Tasmanian parliament in the next two months.

He said the move is not designed to penalise  individuals but to better the health of young Australians.

'What we are saying is that anyone who turns 18 in 2018 will not be able to buy cigarettes and eventually when older smokers die out in 20, 30 years time the sale will end,' he said.

'The important thing is that this is not about criminalising the smokers - it's ensuring retailers and suppliers can't sell to anybody born after the year 2000.' 

Those aged 14-and-under could soon be banned from buying cigarettes from Tasmanian retailers under new laws which would come into effect in 2018

The idea has received backing from  the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Medical Association, whose president Tim Greenaway said any effort to reduce levels of smoking in the community is well supported.

Mr Dean will bring the private members bill before parliament in November, at the latest, and then open up the conversation for debate next year.

If successful, the legislation would be implemented by 2018 making it illegal for people aged 18 and under  to buy tobacco in Tasmania.

Although this particular law would only imply to that state, Mr Dean said he hopes other Australian states and territories would follow suit.

He said Tasmania has been the fore runner in introducing no-smoking policies across the country.

'If it works other states and territories should consider adopting the plan,' he said.

'Tasmania has been the forerunner in setting policy in relation to smoking in many areas.

'We were one of the first states to introduce no smoking in vehicles, no smoking in public places, sporting venues and kids play areas.'

'We have consistently set the pattern on no smoking legislation.'

The push for a tobacco-free generation in Tasmania began two years ago when the Upper House unanimously supported the idea and the Government commissioned a report into the plan from the Children's Commissioner.

Mr Deane said smoking was a 20th-century phenomenon and with all the known risks associated with the activity there should be more done to eradicate it.

'Smoking was a 20th century phenomenon — tobacco-free is a 21st century phenomenon. 

'We need to push it as hard as we can.'
