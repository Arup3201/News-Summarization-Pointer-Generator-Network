A prison chaplain who claims police deliberately broke his leg has been awarded $4 million (£2.6m).

Christopher Graham, a Corrections Department chaplain, was assaulted by police who attended an incident at his apartment, the New York Daily News has reported.

A jury at Manhattan Civil Supreme Court in Brooklyn, New York took just 50 minutes to award Mr Graham $3.95m.

The incident happened in September 2010 when Mr Graham and the mother of his children got into an argument and she called the police claiming he had hit her with with the butt end of a machete - something he denies.

Mr Graham said police arrived at their apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and attacked him.

'They pulled [my] hat off my head and pulled dreadlocks out of my head,' he said. 'They slammed me to the floor and held me down.

'One of them was stepping on my neck and my face. The other one was trying to break my leg.

'He was turning my leg, left and right,' Christopher Graham said. 'I was screaming and banging on the floor. Then I heard a snap. 

'Even after my leg breaks they were still beating my ass,' the chaplain said.

According to the New York Daily News, Mr Graham, 51, said he didn't tell the officers what he did for a living but one officer saw the ID hanging from his neck.

'Then everything changed,' Mr Graham said. 'They thought I was some thug, but now I'm a state chaplain. 

'I knew from the minute this happened I would sue because I know who I am. I did not do anything.'

The misdemeanor assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and harassment charges against Mr Graham were later dropped, his lawyer, Raymond Gazer, said.

Following a trial this month, the jury needed less than an hour to decide on the substantial damages. 

Mr Graham's left tibia and fibula were fractured and he underwent two surgeries. He now suffers from post-traumatic arthritis.

Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for Corporation Counsel, said the city is 'evaluating all of our options for challenging the verdict'.

'We review, in a variety of ways, all allegations of officer misconduct,' Deputy Chief Kim Royster told the New York Daily News. 

'A [verdict in] a civil case does not constitute a finding or even evidence that an officer has engaged in any misconduct.'
