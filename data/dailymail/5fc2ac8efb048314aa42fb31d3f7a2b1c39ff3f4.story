More than a third of adults now have borderline diabetes – caused by a rising tide of obesity, a major study shows today.

Researchers calculate that 14million people in England have ‘prediabetes’ – three times the number since 2006.

The group have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering the full-blown illness and at a higher risk of complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage and sight problems.

Growing pains:  just over half of overweight and obese adults in England have 'prediabetes', researchers have found

But because it does not normally cause any symptoms, millions are unaware they have it unless they undergo blood tests at the GP.

Crucially, many could prevent both prediabetes and the full illness by making small lifestyle changes to lose weight and exercise more.

Academics say that up to 10 per cent of borderline cases may now go on to develop the Type 2 version of diabetes every year, although it is not known how many will get it over the course of their lifetime.

In the first study of its kind, academics from the universities of Leicester and Florida estimated the prevalence of prediabetes, defined by blood sugar levels of between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent.

Diabetics are above 6.5 per cent and normal people are between 4 per cent and 5.6 per cent.

Health risk: 'Prediabetics' have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering full-blown diabetes

Using a sample of 20,000 adults from the Government’s annual Health Survey for England, scientists found that 35.3 per cent had prediabetes in 2011.

The figure is up from 11.6 per cent in 2003, 20.4 per cent in 2006 and 32.6 per cent in 2009.

They also found that just over half of adults – 50.6 per cent –who were overweight or obese had the condition.

The study, published in the British Medical Journal, comes amid rising concerns over the costs of diabetes to the NHS, which spends £10billion a year – a tenth of its budget – on treatment.

Because of the lack of symptoms, researchers are now urging anyone who is overweight or obese to undergo blood sugar tests with their GP.

Study leader Professor Arch Mainous, of the University of Florida, said: ‘It’s very important we detect people early. Prediabetes is reversible. It’s about exercise and calorie restriction – most of these people are overweight and obese.

‘You won’t just slow the onset of diabetes, you can also go back to normal glycaemic level [blood sugar]. You can actually get back to normal.

‘What we really don’t want is people to progress to diabetes as then we are looking at higher levels of kidney disease, heart disease and eye problems.’

If the findings of the study are true for the entire population of England then more than 14.4million adults have prediabetes.

Barbara Young, of the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘Unless we make people aware of their risk of Type 2 diabetes and support them in changing their lifestyles, we could see an even greater increase in the number of people with the condition.’

Britain’s estimated 3.8million diabetics are estimated to climb to 5million by 2025 – largely as a result of obesity and the ageing population.

Last month former NHS boss Sir David Nicholson revealed how he had developed the illness after years of eating fried breakfasts and binge drinking. And health service figures show that up to one in three hospital beds are taken up by diabetics.

Professor Kevin Fenton of Public Health England said action from manufacturers and retailers to reduce the calories, fat and sugar content of foods could be among the ways to reverse the rising numbers of sufferers.

‘No single action will tackle this issue alone,’ he added.
