A Swiss football club says it will investigate reports that some of its fans urinated in a water bottle that a rival goalkeeper then drank from.

Reto Felder, a goalkeeper who plays for Muri in the Swiss fourth division, claims he first though his drink was warmed by the sun. He called the prank 'crude and disgraceful', according to the Blick daily newspaper.

Fans in the crowd - reportedly around 500 strong -  persuaded a ball boy to pass them the bottle. 

Reto Felder plays for FC Muri of the Swiss fourth division and they play at the Stadium Bruehl 

Baden president Thomi Braem, who promised to investigate, says fans 'should realise they have again done great damage (to the club).'

Muri coach Beat Hubeli says the incident was 'the lowest of the low.'

Muri lost at Baden 3-2 on Saturday.
