China's minute capsule hotels are gleaning popularity with young travellers due to their very affordable price tags.

The Space Capsule hotel, in Taiyuan, in the Shanxi province, is one of many to open up in China, after the trend for sleep pods began in Japan, decades ago.

Each of the pokey rooms measure a mere 4.3 feet by 6.6 feet, but costs just under £7 ($10.59) per night to stay in, making them a tempting prospect for budget travellers and young people. 

The 5,200 square-foot building consists of 86 fibreglass capsules in nine rooms, each named after star signs to reflect the space theme.

Along with a simple bed, the rooms contain a  mirror, television, smoke detector, coat hook and fold-down computer desk.

Each is also equipped with is a plug socket, smoke detector and a fan.There's a wireless network for those who wish to stay connected, and even a selection of  soundproofed capsules reserved for people who snore.

According to Chinese newspaper, Xinhua, the hotel manager Xu Meijang was inspired to open the unusual business by the popularity of sleep pod hotels in Japan and by the number of generally young travellers requiring an affordable night's stay in the area.
