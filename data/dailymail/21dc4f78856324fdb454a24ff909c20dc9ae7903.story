Older but better: American women say they are happiest in their fifties, like actress Jodi Foster

The ideal age for an American woman is 53 because they are happy to reap the benefits of being older while still acting as though they are in their thirties, experts say.

A survey of 2,252 adults showed that on average the perfect age for females was 53 - a similar age to actresses Jodi Foster and Andie MacDowell.

Experts say the reason behind the choice is that women in their fifties still act as though they are 35, dating younger men and becoming famous, despite being almost two decades older.

Psychologist Barbara Becker Holstein told Today.com Health: 'We can act and feel at 50 now the way people used to at 35.

'You have almost every opportunity.

'You’re young enough to be famous or start an organic farm and still have the muscle tone to work eight hours a day.

'You’re old enough to have wisdom but young enough that your parents are still alive so you have a generational experience.

'If you’re tired, you can ask the young man on the bus to get out of his seat for you.

'Or you can date the young man. The more I think about it, the more appealing it is.'

Participants of the Harris interactive poll were asked if they could stop time and live forever in good health at a particular age, what age that would be.

Those aged 18 to 36 thought the perfect age was 38.

Americans aged 37 to 48 wanted to stay put at 49, while those aged 49 to 67 decided on 55.

Mature adults, aged 68 and older, were happy at 67.

On average, men wanted to be younger than women, choosing 47 over the average perfect age for females of 53. 

Those with kids in the household said they would like to stay 45 forever, while those without children opted for 53.

A similar survey conducted 10 
years ago found that most people thought 41 was the perfect age.

Experts say the change is down to several reasons, including the influence of the 
boomer generation and recent 'medical miracles.'

Psychologist Barbara Becker Holstein said: 'If you’re lucky enough to have good health and money to 
take care of yourself, why not incorporate the wisdom and maturity that 
goes with age?'

Holstein said all of the recent medical, and cosmetic, developments have also helped 50 become more appealing.

She
 added: ''For a woman, you can stay stylish and fit and maybe get your 
hair dyed or just do a little [cosmetic] tune-up and feel, "Wow, this is
 great."

'In terms of childbearing, you can basically say forget it or if you want a baby at 50 or 53, you can get your hormones juiced up and go for it.'

Holstein said research shows people are more comfortable with themselves the older they get and that as we age, we tend to be less depressed, less anxious and more optimistic than our juniors.

She added: 'It’s kind of a hiatus age. Lots of people don’t have grandchildren by 50 so you’re not necessarily tied down babysitting.

'Of course, given how slowly young people mature now, you may still be dealing with someone in their 20s who loves living at home.'
