Seven years after conjoined twin girls from Utah were separated in an operation that had never been performed before, they are happy and healthier than ever.

Kendra and Maliyah Herrin are now 11-years-old and are living active lives with their younger twin brothers, big sister and parents in Salt Lake City, they told the Oprah Winfrey Network.

They were four when their parents, Erin and Jake, made the agonizing decision to separate them after they were born fused at the mid-torso and sharing two legs.

The 26-hour surgery in August 2006 was the first time the operation had ever been performed on twins sharing a kidney, but it was successful - and little Maliyah was given a kidney transplant from her mother months later.

Strong: The girls were born sharing two legs and now have one leg each, but are working with prosthetics

The girls, who had shared an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, were left with one leg each.

After six weeks at the hospital, they returned home and had their bandages changed three times a week, a job which took two hours for each child.

Maliyah also needed extra nutrition through a feeding tube, and underwent dialysis three times a week to prepare for her new kidney, which she received in April 2007.

Now 11, they are 'healthier than ever, but prone to infections because of the titanium rods in their backs', their mother Erin said as they appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The overall survival rate of conjoined twins is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported.

The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than 
males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs.

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines.

Kendra and Maliyah have surgeries to straighten their spines every six months and undergo daily physical therapy.

They are also learning how to use crutches and prosthetic limbs.

And they do not let anything stop them; in a clip that aired on Oprah's 'Where They Are Now?' segment on Sunday, the girls giggled as they talked about their busy lives.

On their Facebook page, the Herrin Twins, they are pictured enjoying days out at swimming pools, jumping on trampolines and visiting amusement parks with their friends and siblings.

'I like swimming, playing with friends, riding bikes, jumping on the tramp[oline],' Kendra says in the clip on the Oprah Winfrey show.

'Eating,' Maliyah adds.

'Yeah, eating!' Kendra says.

The girls even stayed upbeat as they talked about how their surgeries 'stink' and how they miss seeing their dog when they go to the hospital.

Their mother keeps friends, family and strangers updated on the girls' progress on their family blog.

Loved: The family were worried about the separation because the twins shared the same kidney

Success! They are seen leaving the Primary Children's Medical Center for home in September 2007

Beautiful: They are pictured after the operation. 'Their wills are so strong,' her mother said afterwards

'Kendra and Maliyah are so HAPPY!! They 
have so many people that love them so much. Their smiles light up a 
room,' Erin wrote in one entry.

'They have taught me so much about being who I need to. And taking one day at a time.

'It took them years to recover from their separation surgery, and it takes them sometimes weeks to recover from other surgeries and sicknesses. They take everything in stride and they move forward.'

The girls have had this drive since the very beginning.

Five months after they were separated, they met Oprah for the first time and their mother spoke of their determination.

Active: The Herrin twins said they love swimming, cycling and bouncing on their trampoline

All smiles: The girls said they hate undergoing operations to straighten their spines but remain positive

Fighters: The 11-year-old girls are now learning how to walk with prosthetic legs and the use of crutches

Standing tall: They undergo physical therapy every day and surgeries every six months to straighten their spines

'Their wills are so strong,' Erin said at the time. 'Kendra is just up and down off of her bed. It's just amazing to us how well that they're doing.'

After the girls were born, the family welcomed another set of twins, Austin and Justin, who are now seven. They joined the eldest of the Herrin brood, Courtney, who is now 13.
