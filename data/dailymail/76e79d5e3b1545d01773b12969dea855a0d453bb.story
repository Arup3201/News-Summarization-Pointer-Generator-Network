One of the Coalition’s flagship free schools submitted false invoices and wrongly claimed tens of thousands of pounds of public money.

Kings Science Academy in Bradford was given £86,335 in funding that had ‘not been used for its intended purpose’.

It charged for first class travel, parties, buying furniture for staff and submitted ‘fabricated invoices’ to the Department for Education for rent it did not actually pay.

The revelation, broadcast in a BBC2 
Newsnight investigation last night, is a major embarrassment for the 
Government and follows a series of controversies about free schools.

Last week, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as ‘dysfunctional’.

Free schools can be set up by charities, parents and teachers and are independent of local authority control.

Kings Science Academy was one of the 
first free schools to open in September 2011 and was praised by David 
Cameron on a visit last year.

An inquiry was launched following 
allegations raised by a whistleblower about the way the school was being
 governed.

Concerns raised by accountants hired 
by the school led to a ‘forensic’ investigation by the Education Funding
 Agency.

Its final report published yesterday, found that of a £182,933 
grant made to the school before it opened, £86,335 had not been used for
 its intended purposes.

Invoices worth £59,560 were not supported by any evidence of payments being made.

This included ‘fabricated’ invoices to the sum of £10,800 to cover rent for office accommodation.

A total of £26,775 had been overpaid 
against legitimate payments. The report revealed how more than £600 was 
spent on parties or meals, £169 went to a teacher to buy new clothes, 
payments were made to cover staff rent and furniture purchases and the 
former vice chairman of governors was allowed to travel first class.

Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, described the financial irregularities as a 'disgrace'

The former chairman of governors was 
paid £2,400 for holding three meetings in a way that appeared to be 
‘contrary to the funding agreement’ of the school.

The Department for Education 
yesterday insisted a plan has been put in place to recover funds and the
 school has been asked to address concerns urgently.

The school was issued with a warning 
notice in May and has since implemented a plan to restructure its 
governing body and appoint an experienced finance director.

Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘It is now apparent that the DfE has been sitting on the report detailing financial irregularities at the Kings Science Academy since May and only released it once it became clear that the NUT had released to the press its own document outlining financial irregularities at the school.

‘The catalogue of irregularities and what frankly points to fraud in the management of the school’s finances acknowledged in the DfE’s investigation report is a disgrace.

‘Problems around good governance, financial probity and standards of education are emerging in increasing numbers of free schools. The Government cannot continue to claim that these are isolated cases.’

A DfE spokesman said: ‘Academies and free schools are subject to tougher financial accountability measures than maintained schools.

‘Unfortunately no system of financial accountability for any school can guarantee it will prevent all  wrongdoing.

‘However, we take swift action when concerns are raised – academies and free schools cannot hide from their financial responsibilities and are held to account for their actions.’
