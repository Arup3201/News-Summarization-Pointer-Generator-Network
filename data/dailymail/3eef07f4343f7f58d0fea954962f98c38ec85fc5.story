France branded the British as ‘hypocrites’ yesterday over David Cameron’s demands that Paris abandon its £1billion warship sale to Russia.

The Prime Minister says it would be ‘unthinkable’ for French president Francois Hollande to go ahead with the supply of two helicopter carriers to Moscow.

European leaders have been under intense pressure to impose tough sanctions on Russian – or risk repeating the mistakes of Nazi appeasers in the 1930s.

But Mr Hollande has vowed to press on with the deal, with an ally warning Mr Cameron that he should ‘start by cleaning up his own back yard’.

French President Francois Hollande has vowed to press ahead with selling warships to Russia, despite criticism from David Cameron

Mr Cameron is pushing for tougher sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his 'cronies' in attempt to force Moscow to reign in separatists in eastern Ukraine

Asked on Monday whether France should pull out, Mr Cameron said: ‘Frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the French have.

‘But we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we cannot go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way.’

In response, Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, head of Hollande’s ruling Socialist Party, said: ‘Hollande is not backing down. He is delivering the first (ship) despite the fact he is being asked not to.

‘This is a false debate led by hypocrites. When you see how many (Russian) oligarchs have sought refuge in London, David Cameron should start by cleaning up his own back yard.’

Tougher sanctions have been proposed in an
 attempt to force Mr Putin to rein in the separatists in eastern 
Ukraine.

After an emergency summit in Brussels, Mr Cameron hailed an 
agreement in principle to widen measures against Mr Putin’s ‘cronies’ 
and to consider targeting Russia’s defence sector.

But Lithuania’s 
president reflected growing anger in former Soviet countries at the 
failure of EU leaders to move decisively following the downing of flight
 MH17.

‘If European states keep on acting so indecisively, this is a 
direct invitation for the aggressor to be more aggressive and go 
further,’ said Dalia Grybauskaite, condemning France for pressing ahead 
with the Mistral sale.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last year teased David Cameron about the influx of wealthy foreigners into London.

Britain was dismissed as 'a small island’ by his spokesman, who claimed nobody pays attention to it – except of course the Russian ‘oligarchs who have bought Chelsea’.

That does not mean that every wealthy Russian in London now faces the prospect of sanctions.

But it does raise questions about the UK government's willingness to accept their millions into the Treasury's coffers. 

‘In the 1930s, Nazism wasn’t stopped, and now
 aggressive Russian chauvinism isn’t stopped and that resulted in the 
attack against a civilian plane.’

Yesterday, the EU threatened 
Moscow with broad economic sanctions if it failed to muzzle pro-Russian 
separatists fomenting chaos in Ukraine – but stopped short of any 
immediate action to punish the Kremlin.

Philip Hammond, Britain’s new
 Foreign Secretary, had called for an immediate arms embargo, while 
Britain and Germany also brandished lists of names of pro-Putin 
individuals and firms they want targeted.

EU foreign ministers agreed to
 draft a new set of names by tomorrow to be added to the 63 individuals 
and entities already targeted.

The latest move could mean a big increase in asset freezes and travel bans.

EU leaders also agreed to prepare further options, including a potential arms embargo and broader sanctions against Russia’s energy and financial sectors.

Many of Russia’s billionaire businessmen are said to be ‘horrified’ at the prospect of crippling economic sanctions but are too terrified of Mr Putin to say so openly.

There was a suggestion last night that the threat of sanctions is already having an impact on Russian oligarchs.

Asked if there was any evidence of assets being moved out of London, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The measures which have been taken with regard to individuals and entities has got a correlation with some of the financial flows we have seen across Europe, including here in London.

'That’s certainly the case.’

Of the Brussels talks, Mr Cameron said: ‘We are making progress.

'Other countries of Europe can now see that this lethal cocktail of allowing weapons and armed personnel to go into eastern Ukraine and support separatists has ended in this appalling tragedy.’

Mr Putin last night declared that Russia would strengthen its military capability to ‘counter Nato activity’ in Eastern Europe.
