Dennis Irwin has hailed Daley Blind's versatility and backed him to retain a place in the Manchester United starting XI, even when injured players return.

The former United left-back, who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002, was impressed by Blind when he played in that position during Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham.

It was United's best performance of the season, keeping them anchored in the Premier League top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend's crunch trip to Anfield to play Liverpool.

Sunday's clash between Manchester United and Liverpool will be pivotal in the top four race

'Daley's a good, honest pro,' Irwin told ManUtd.com. 'He can play at centre-half if you need him, left-back if you need him, and obviously he's played mostly in midfield for us this season. I think he's been a really good signing.

'He's a player who reads situations very, very well, I thought he played extremely well on Sunday. It'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against Liverpool, but it wouldn't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players, because they played so well.

'That's the manager's decision and he's got one or two back from suspension and injury, but I thought the team played very well on Sunday.'

Dutch international Blind, who arrived at Old Trafford from Ajax for £13.8m last summer, has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the English game.

Irwin added: 'I know Blind can fill in places and he's done tremendously well for us in midfield.

'He hasn't played at left-back that many times, he's not played centre-half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there.

'I thought Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were aggressive, didn't give Harry Kane much room, and Antonio Valencia played really well at right-back, so it was good to see and we'll need plenty of that at Anfield.'
