Grave charges: Danny Coston, 36, is accused of gunning down 17-year-old Jessica Evans and killing her 22-year-old boyfriend last weekend

An Illinois man has been arrested and charged with murdering a young couple whose bodies were found days apart after the two went missing last weekend, according to police.

Jessica Evans, 17, and her boyfriend, 22-year-old Jacob Wheeler, disappeared while on a camping and fishing trip near the Little Wabash River.

On Monday afternoon, police found Evans dead in the bed of her boyfriend’s pickup truck, setting off a manhunt for Wheeler, who became a person of interest in the investigation.

According to White County Sheriff Doug Maier, officials had a break in the investigation on Friday after coming across evidence of a second vehicle at the scene of the couple’s disappearance, according to the station KFVS.

Pieces of a wrecked car were linked to 36-year-old Danny Coston, of Carmi, who confessed to killing the couple when questioned by police. 

Early Saturday morning, Maier has confirmed that the 22-year-old’s remains were discovered in a rural area of Wayne County based on information provided by the suspect.

Coston has been preliminarily charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

Sheriff Maier called the crime a ‘random type situation’ that turned into a horrible event. Coston was apparently an acquaintance of Wheeler's father, but did not know the 22-year-old man or his girlfriend. 

‘We hope this brings some closure to the families of Jessica and Jacob,’ said Sheriff Maier.  ‘Our thoughts are with them.’

Wheeler and Evans, a popular senior at Norris City-Omaha-Enfield High School, were reported missing Sunday after the 17-year-old girl failed to show up for work at 5am, according to the Evansville Courier & Press. 

Body found: Wheeler's remains were discovered early Saturday morning in a wooded area north of Interstate 64

Sheriff Maier told The Southern that the couple had been ‘dating only a short time, just a matter of a few months.’

Wheeler, a U.S. Army veteran who had served in Iraq, was married but amicably separated from his wife, according to police.

Norris City-Omaha-Enfield School Superintendent Cliff Karnes has described Evans as a ‘good kid’ who loved art.

The 17-year-old was discovered with three gunshot wounds to the head in Wheeler’s truck on Monday.

The vehicle had rolled down an embankment and over a large tree before coming to rest in a heavily wooded area. No weapon was found in the pickup or nearby, and the keys were missing.

The sheriff’s department and other law enforcement agencies launched a search by foot, all-terrain vehicles, horseback and air in an attempt to find Wheeler, but it was not until Coston’s arrest that his body was finally recovered north of Interstate 64.

Authorities said they believe they know the motive behind the killings, but would not release the details just yet.

Coston is being held on $3million in the White County Jail. Formal charges will be filed against him after the Labor Day weekend.
