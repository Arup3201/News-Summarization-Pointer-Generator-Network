Grant Bovey was released from bankruptcy in 2011 following the collapse of his property business with debts of £50m

Anthea Turner's estranged husband is having money problems for the second time in two years after his media business lost £6million.

Now Grant Bovey and the ex-Blue Peter presenter, who are going through a divorce following revelations of Bovey's cheating, are looking to sell their Surrey mansion and French ski chalet to cover the losses.

The couple are thought to have received a £5million offer for the Surrey property earlier this month which, if completed, would give them a profit of £700,000.

The couple also spent the night together in the chalet trying to finalise paperwork for its sale.

Friends say Bovey, 51, is going to use the cash to restart his faltering business empire and that Anthea, 53, is supporting him, even after Bovey was caught cheating with 25-year-old socialite Zoe de Mallet Morgan.

Zoe and Bovey split up in August after a party holiday to Ibiza underlined the age gap and left the father-of-four struggling to keep up.

Despite being discharged from bankruptcy 
in 2011 ago when his property business fell apart leaving £50million in 
debts, Bovey believes a string of innovative new business ideas can turn
his fortunes around.

A source close to the couple has told the Sunday Mirror that Bovey is now replying heavily on Anthea while he tries to get his business affairs in order.

He is thought to be finalising a TV game show called Revolution which will allow viewers to take part using their smartphones.

Sympathy: despite their divorce Anthea is said to be sympathetic to Bovey's plight

Records published by Companies House show that Yummi Media, founded by Anthea in 2010 because Bovey was still disqualified, lost £4.8million last year and another £1.3million in 2011. It also has debts of £2.3million.

A source close to Bovey told the Sunday Mirror: 'The figures look bad, but that's because so much money has gone into getting the technology right. The rewards are potentially massive.'

At the start of this month Anthea 
accepted an offer of £5 million for her Surrey mansion, £700,000 more 
than what she paid when she bought the six-bedroom estate in April 2011.

This is the Surrey mansion that Anthea has reportedly sold for £5million after buying it for £4.3million

Set in five acres of land and complete with a swimming pool, the couple are splitting the proceeds evenly

Bovey hopes the money from the sale of this property and a French ski chalet will restart his ailing businesses

Set in almost two acres of land in a private road in Esher, Surrey with an indoor swimming pool, no doubt the sale will help her move on from her divorce.

At the time a family friend said: 'At the moment she is talking of a fair split with Grant, but some of her confidantes say she should be tougher with him.

'They argue that she kept them both when Grant’s property empire imploded and her money went into the houses.

'But Anthea is nothing but fair and says they should share the proceeds. But she is devastated about having to sell the chalet.'
