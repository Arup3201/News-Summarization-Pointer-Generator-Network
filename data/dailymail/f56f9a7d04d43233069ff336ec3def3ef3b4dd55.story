A globetrotting automotive consultant has become a real-life Ryan Bingham - the character played by George Clooney in the film Up In The Air - by clocking up a million miles in a single year.

Tom Stuker took his love of travel to new heights by becoming the first customer of United Airlines to achieve the feat.

Mr Stuker, who divides the little time he spends outside of a plane between New Jersey and Chicago, was recognised for his record on December 6 United Flight 949 from London to Chicago.

This is the latest travel milestone for the 59-year-old super-frequent flier, who in July 2011 became the first person to fly 10 million miles on United. To mark the accomplishment, the airline honored Stuker by putting his name on a Boeing 747.

With more than 13 million miles under his belt, Stuker is one of commercial aviation's highest-mileage travelers.

In the Oscar-nominated movie Up in the Air, Clooney's high-flying character, Ryan Bingham, details the life of a 10-million-miler, from the free round-the-world airline tickets right down to the personal greeting from ticket agents who have likely never met him.

Stuker estimates he has flown more than 6,000 flights on United, including about 400 flights this calendar year alone which equals circumnavigating the world about 40 times.

Cruising at 570 mph, a single nonstop flight of one million miles would land 73 days after takeoff. Stuker's 11 million miles flown on United would also put him about a third of the distance from Earth to Mars.

Stuker, an automotive sales consultant who will soon appear in Spike TV’s upcoming reality show Car Lot Rescue, began clocking his miles after joining United's MileagePlus loyalty program in 1983.

Since then, he has logged most of his miles flying to Asia and Australia, where he helps struggling car dealerships, and has visited all 50 U.S. states.

As one of the world's most avid 
globetrotters, Stuker enjoys many perks that his fellow passengers can 
only dream of: he usually flies first class and is a member of United’s 
elite Global Services, an invitation-only program that offers 'certain 
unpublished benefits.'

Frequent flier: Stuker is an independent automotive sales consulate and travels a lot for work, visiting car dealerships in Asia and Australia, as well as in Europe

New career: Stuker, center, will soon appear in Spike TV's new reality show called Car Lot Rescue in which he will be whipping into shape failing auto dealerships

For 
Stuker, the quest for the million milestone began when a fellow frequent
flier suggested that the two of them should try for the 'sexy' round 
number.

Stuker said he was 
crisscrossing the globe for work, going back and forth between the U.S. 
and Australia, and thought that he was on a strong pace to reach the 
goal.

Nemesis: Stuker's arch-rival in the record-setting business is Fred Finn, the British businessman in his 70s who claims to have logged more than 15 million miles on different airlines

While his friend abandoned the 
challenge due to health problems, the 59-year-old decided to go for the 
record, although he admits that he could not have done it flying coach.

Speaking to NBC from
Hawaii, Stuker said that in all his time flying, he has never 
experienced a serious emergency, not counting aborted takeoffs and 
landings.

Stuker said that beside traveling for work, he and his wife, who is a teacher, love visiting new places and never miss an opportunity to take off for a new destination, even for just a couple of days.

On the Stukers' itinerary is a two-night trip to Buenos Aires in January, a getaway to Hawaii for President's Day and a romantic week in April that will be split between Paris and Prague.

But while Stuker's record is 
impressive, he is not the only jet-setter out there. The 59-year-old man
has a powerful rival in the face of Fred Finn, a British businessman in
his 70s who has allegedly logged a lifetime record of more than 15 
million miles on various airlines.

Stuker,
however, is neither impressed with not intimidated by his opponent's 
record, saying that being in his late 50s, he has many more years of 
travel ahead of him.

'God willing, I’m going to be passing him in a couple of years. He knows who I am,’ Stuker told the New York Times.
