The Coalition was split yesterday on David Cameron’s plans to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, with a Lib Dem minister saying it could ‘put us on the wrong side’ of Europe.

Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish Secretary, said he would ‘need to be persuaded’ on proposals to impose a minimum period before newly-arrived migrants could claim handouts.

However, London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the Prime Minister’s calls for restrictions, saying: ‘It is clearly time for the UK to take back more control of the terms under which EU migrants arrive on our streets.

'We need much more flexibility to set conditions for claiming benefits.

‘I am in favour of immigration by talented and hard-working people, but the present system is mad: cracking down on Australians, New Zealanders and high-spending Chinese students and tourists, but completely incapable of dealing with a sizeable influx from within the EU, some of whom show no sign of wanting to work.’ 

The reluctance to impose restrictions by the Lib Dems comes despite even Labour accepting there should be controls to ensure immigrants do not come here from Eastern Europe purely to live a life on benefits.

Proposals: Mr Cameron plans to impose a minimum period before newly-arrived immigrants can claim benefits

Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, yesterday said her party had suggested nine months ago it was in favour of transitionary limits on benefits for Romanians and Bulgarians moving to Britain after border controls are lifted on January 1.

The comments will, however, raise eyebrows, because Labour refused to impose similar controls in 2004 when the borders were flung open to migrants from Poland and elsewhere in the EU.

Number 10 has acted after two polls revealed deep public unease about immigration.

On Friday, a survey for the Mail showed more than four in five people did not want unrestricted access to the UK for Romanians and Bulgarians, and said they were concerned the NHS and schools would be put under too much pressure.

And a poll for The Times a day later showed that, by a huge margin, tightening border controls tops the wishlist for renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU before a referendum in 2017.

The Mail revealed on Saturday that new limits on EU migrants who claim benefits in Britain are to be a key demand in the Government’s attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with Europe.

Cabinet sources say that gaining the right to ‘shut the door’ on  benefits for newcomers and existing migrants who have not lived here for a minimum period – possibly around six months – would be top of the list.

Details are expected to be announced by the Prime Minister soon, perhaps as early as this week.

Number 10’s tough stance on migrants comes days after two polls revealed just how worried Britons are about border controls.

On Friday, a survey  for the Mail showed 82 per cent would say no to free access to the  UK for Romanians and Bulgarians.

While on Saturday, a survey for The Times showed that despite voters being happy with David Cameron’s stance on immigration controls, a poll of their priorities before he attempts to claw back powers from Brussels put tightening border controls at the top.

It led the next two highest-ranked priorities – human rights reform and expanding non-EU trade – by a margin of 30 per cent.

One Tory minister said: ‘Everyone knows we’ve got to do something. And something big.’

But yesterday, Mr Carmichael voiced concerns at imposing tougher conditions on EU migrants amid fears about the number of Bulgarians and Romanians expected to come to the UK from January.

David Cameron is hopeful for support from a number of other EU countries for curbs on ‘welfare tourism’.

As many as 12 countries, including Spain, Germany and Denmark, are understood to have concerns that large numbers of people are arriving only to claim generous benefits.

All are demanding powers to limit the benefits that can be claimed – but so far the European Commission has proved unwilling to change.

The Commission has previously threatened Britain over plans to limit benefits handouts, claiming that they ‘infringe the human rights’ of EU citizens.

One Cabinet minister said: ‘The writing is on the wall for the way the Commission is behaving. Other countries have also had enough.’

The move could trigger a clash with the European Commission, which prevents member states from discriminating between their own citizens and those from other European Union members.

The Lib Dem MP told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics that he could ‘see the need for robust  transitional arrangements’ but he added: ‘I would need to be persuaded of that, but I am prepared to look at the whole situation in  the round.

‘Potentially it might put us on  the wrong side of the rest of the European Union. It’s something that we should be discussing with them, certainly.’

But Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove also backed Mr Cameron’s position yesterday.

On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he said: ‘The Prime Minister … struck exactly the right note on migration, which is to celebrate the achievements of people who come here.

‘But when it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the EU, we need to look properly at the benefits system to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute, not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system.’
