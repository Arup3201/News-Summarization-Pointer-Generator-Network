A teenage brother and sister have been killed in a home invasion shooting on New Year's Eve that left their father and their father's girlfriend critically wounded.

The shooting was committed early in the evening by unknown people trying to rob the house, according to the Barberton Police Department in northeast Ohio.

Ashley Carpenter, 18, and David Kohler-Carpenter, 14, were pronounced dead at the scene.

Ashley Carpenter, 18, was shot dead in her Ohio home on New Year's Eve along with her 14-year-old brother David (pictured right)

Police say they are the children of 42-year-old John Kohler, who was injured in the assault along with his girlfriend, 38-year-old Ronda Blankenship.

Police say both were taken to Akron hospitals but current conditions were not available.

Autopsies for the teens are scheduled for Thursday.

Miss Carpenter was a senior at Barberton High while her brother was in middle school.

Police told Ohio.com that at least two gunmen broke into the family's home around 7pm on December 31. Police responded following a 911 call from an anonymous source.

Officer Marty Eberhart said that he 
believed to motive to be robbery but would not reveal further details 
but that authorities had leads to who was behind the slayings. 

The childrenâ€™s mother, Leiha Carpenter, lives in the town.

Tim Terry and Michelle Olei, who live 
next door, told ohio.com: 'I had my video game going. I didnâ€™t hear 
anything. I think it was something personal.'
