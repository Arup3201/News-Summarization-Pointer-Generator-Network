Four young Syrian women who staged a women’s march against violence dressed in wedding dresses are now in jail.

The 'Brides of Peace' marched through the middle of Medhat Basha market in Damascus, Syria carrying red banners with white lettering that read 'Stop all military operations in Syria. 100% Syrian.' 

But Rima Dali, Rowa Jafar, and sisters Kinda and Lobna Zaour were immediately detained and denied due process by Syrian security forces last week.

Bravery: Four young Syrian women who staged a women¿s march for against in Syria dressed in wedding dresses are now in jail

Footage of their 
march was put out immediately by Freedom Days Syria, an umbrella 
organization coordinating over a dozen nonviolent resistance groups 
inside Syria, reported Fellowship of Reconciliation.  

Their imprisonment has caused a massive surge of support for the activists and women from across the world posed for photos of themselves 
dressed in white gowns holding red and white signs that reflect the 
message of the 'Brides of Peace.'

It is not the first time Rima Dali, 32, a lawyer, has been stopped by authorities.

In April the 33-year-old was reportedly arrested in Damascus as she 
staged a bold protest outside the Syrian Parliament building, standing 
in traffic with a banner that read, 'Stop the killing, so we can build a
 country for all Syrians.'

Video posted on YouTube showed several other women standing nearby, applauding the action.

Ms Dali wore a red dress splattered with white paint to symbolize the 
blood of innocents that has been shed in Syria during the past year.

Explosion: Twin car bombs have ripped through a Damascus suburb killing and wounding dozens of people

Injured: A boy who was injured in the explosions in Jaramana district, near Damascus, receives treatment at a hospital as well as a man who was hurt

Meanwhile this morning twin car bombs have ripped through a Damascus suburb killing and wounding dozens of people.

The Syrian state news agency said the cars packed with explosives detonated early in the morning in the eastern Jaramana district which is mostly loyal to president Bashar Assad. At least 34 people died.

A series of blasts have struck regime targets since last December, raising fears of a rising Islamic militant element among the forces seeking to topple Assad.

Fatal: At least 34 people were killed in explosions which struck the eastern Damascus district of Jaramana

The bombs went off in a car park between two commercial buildings. They were detonated within five minutes of one another as groups of labourers and employees were arriving to work.

The blasts shattered windows in nearby buildings, littering the street with glass and debris. Human remains were scattered on the pavement amid pools of blood.

After the first explosion, people 
rushed to the site to help the injured and then the second bomb went 
off, said Ismail Zlaiaa, 54, who lives nearby.

There
 were conflicting reports about the death toll. Hospitals said at least 
30 bodies were brought in. The British-based Observatory for Human 
Rights, which relies on reports from the ground, said 29 people were 
killed. And the state SANA news agency put the toll at 34.

Medical help: State-run television said four explosions, including two car bombs, hit the area of Jaramana, whose residents are believed to support President Bashar al-Assad

Syria's conflict started 20 months ago as an uprising against Assad and morphed into a civil war, with rebels taking up arms to fight back against a crackdown by the government. According to activists, 40,000 people have been killed since March 2011.

Assad blames the revolt on a 
conspiracy to destroy Syria, saying the uprising is being driven by 
foreign "terrorists" - a term the authorities use for the rebels - and 
not Syrians seeking change.

Analysts
 say most of those fighting Assad's regime are ordinary Syrians and 
soldiers who have defected, disenchanted with the authoritarian 
government. But increasingly, foreign fighters and those adhering to an 
extremist Islamist ideology are turning up on the front lines. The 
rebels try to play down the Islamists' influence for fear of alienating 
Western support.

Rebels fighting to topple Assad are predominantly members of the Sunni Muslim majority. In their push to take Damascus, they have frequently targeted state institutions and troops around the country. They have also often hit districts around the capital with the country's minority communities, perceived to be allied with Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot Shiite group that dominates the regime.

Central Damascus - the seat of Assad's power - has also seen scores of car bombs and mortar attacks that have targeted state security institutions and troops, areas with homes of wealthy Syrians, army officers, security officials and other members of the regime.
