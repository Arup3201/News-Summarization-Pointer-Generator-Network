Ryan Seager has won the inaugural Barclays Under 21 Player of the Month award after impressing for Southampton in February.

The 19-year-old made his debut for the senior team last month against Swansea, as well as scoring one and making one assist for the youth side, and has been chosen ahead of all the players in Division 1 and 2 (24 teams) based on his performance statistics.

Seager also recently netted a hat-trick against Derby County in the Under 21 Premier League Cup, and is looking to follow in the footsteps of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and James Ward-Prowse in making the step up on the South Coast.

Sportsmail held an exclusive Q&A with Seager after he found out about his award.

What's your style of play?

A poacher, getting in around the box, it's where I score most of my goals. 

Who do you model your game on?

Michael Owen in his early days, and obviously with Southampton it's Matt Le Tissier. He was my biggest inspiration from early on as a Saints fan.

Have you worked with the first team?

In the last few months and when I made my debut I was training with them quite a lot, they've got near enough a whole first-team squad fit now so it's getting harder but I still train with them every now and again. It's a good experience.

Do you speak to Ronald Koeman often?

He gives me advice in training, as do Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, with my shooting and movement.

What do you do to relax away from football? Hobbies?

I'd love to say golf but I'm not very good at it! I just relax really, I like all sports but don't play too many.

Last album you listened to?

Probably The Wanted, someone like that.

Last film you watched?

Fury. I loved it - I love war films.

Another youngster you'd tip to make it at Southampton?

Jake Hesketh. Made his debut for the first team in December, we're a good combination on FIFA! I've got a career mode on the game with Southampton at the moment, only in my first season so don't know if I get any good yet. I bring myself off the bench though...

Seager says the best youth player he has ever played against is Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj

Best young player you've played against?

Adnan Januzaj in Under 18's. We played them away from home and he was just tearing it up. It was before he made his United debut, but I knew he would make it.

What would you be doing now if you weren't a footballer?

I think about that all the time. I've always thought it would be nice to work in a supermarket. Don't ask me why. I've always found it interesting.

Best advice you've been given?

Rickie Lambert, last season when I trained with him, told me I don't always have to shoot with power, to finesse it more often, and since then I've scored most of my goals from that. I look back to that advice.

Any advice for young players?

Work hard. If you keep working, you never know! 

Seager says he might fancy working in a supermarket if he wasn't a footballer at Southampton

The award has been established to recognise the next generation of players coming through, coinciding with Barclays' own work to encourage the next generation of fans, which will see thousands of tickets and unique football experiences given away via the Barclays Spirit of the Game website. 

A winner will be selected every month for the rest of the season, as well as the Barclays Under 21 Premier League Player of the Season being unveiled in May.
