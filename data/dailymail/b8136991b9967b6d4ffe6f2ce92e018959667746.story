Apology: Lord Justice Fulford, who sits in the Appeal Court

One of the country’s most senior judges was facing calls to be suspended last night after his links with a notorious paedophile pressure group were revealed.

Lord Justice Fulford, who was appointed an Appeal Court judge only last year, was founder of a campaign group that tried to defend and promote the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE).

The campaign carried out a demonstration outside a courtroom in favour of PIE members on trial, including its leader Tom O’Carroll, who was later jailed for possessing pictures of naked children. Fulford also took part in meetings at which O’Carroll was present.

During the campaign, Lord Justice Fulford, then a radical young barrister, said the paedophile organisation was no more than a means for ‘paedophiles to make friends and offer each other mutual support’.

The judge is the latest figure to be embarrassed over links to PIE.

Last month, Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman expressed regret over the help given to PIE by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), the organisation for which she worked as legal officer. Her MP husband Jack Dromey and former Labour Cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt were also part of the NCCL while it allowed PIE to operate as an affiliate.

Yesterday, Lord Justice Fulford apologised for his connection to the paedophile group, but anti-child-abuse campaigners said he should be suspended while an inquiry into his past political activities was conducted.

Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘There should now be a suspension.

‘This discovery is akin to finding out that someone who is now in a high-ranking and responsible position was an active supporter of the IRA at the time it was planting bombs and murdering people. We are talking about a very serious matter here. I think suspension is the right course.’

Labour MP Tom Watson said the disclosure ‘reinforces the argument that there should be a full investigation into the role of PIE’.

Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman, expressed regret over the help given to PIE by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), which her MP husband Jack Dromey was also part of

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office could start an inquiry. If any fault were found, the judge’s future would be decided by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Responding to the allegations against him in the Mail on Sunday, Lord Justice Fulford apologised, but said he had ‘no memory’ of founding the Conspiracy to Corrupt Public Morals campaign group, which operated in support of PIE, or details of its work.

‘I have always been deeply opposed to paedophilia and I never supported the views or objectives of the PIE. I attended a few meetings of the NCCL’s gay rights committee. I remember that for a short period Tom O’Carroll was sometimes present, which left me feeling extremely uncomfortable.

‘In the main, I provided some legal advice in the context of general civil liberties objections to the wide-ranging charge of conspiracy to corrupt public morals.’

He said he profoundly disagreed with those who sought to lower the age of consent. PIE campaigned for it to be set at the age of four.

Sir Adrian Fulford, 61, became the first openly gay barrister to be promoted to the High Court bench in 2002. He was a housing adviser for Shelter and political activist in the 1970s before becoming a lawyer.
