Hundreds of dog lovers blockaded Romania's Parliament in protest today after the country's constitutional court upheld a law allowing strays to be euthanised.

The protesters, who blew whistles and brought some of their dogs as they took to the street in Bucharest, yelled 'Criminal court!' and 'May you have the same fate as the dogs!'

The ruling came weeks after a four-year-old boy's fatal mauling in the Romanian capital led the government to draft the legislation.

The bill needs to be signed by the president before it can become law. Under it, stray dogs will be taken to shelters and - if not adopted or claimed within 14 days - they will be killed.

The Vier Pfoten animal welfare group criticised the ruling, saying it ignored an appeal by the European Commission to Romania to protect animal rights.

The group urged Romanian mayors and vets to stop the 'mass killings' of dogs.

The World Society for the Protection of Animals criticised the ruling and called the bill 'both inhumane and ineffective'.

It called on the court and the government to find a more 'effective, sustainable and humane solution to manage the stray dog population.'

Bucharest City Hall says the capital has 64,000 stray dogs, while animal rights groups say there are 40,000.

A hospital that handles infectious diseases has treated 9,760 people for dog bites in the first eight months of this year.
