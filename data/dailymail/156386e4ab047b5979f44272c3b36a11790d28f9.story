American skier Lindsey Vonn today clinched a record-breaking 65th World Cup victory after winning a women's Super-G in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, following an eight-race winless streak.

Vonn, 30, who is chasing her fifth Super-G World Cup title, raced to success in just one minute, 16.65 seconds, in sunny conditions, regaining the lead in the discipline with one race remaining.

Speaking after the event, donning a sleeveless neon-yellow T-shirt with 'making history' printed in white on it, she told reporters: 'Yesterday was disappointing so I came out with the right attitude.'

A day earlier, Vonn had ranked seventh in downhill at Garmisch, where she used to stay during Christmas holidays. 'I wanted to ski my best and attack and I did. A nice way to win,' she said today.

Previous support: It is unclear whether Vonn's boyfriend, golfer Tiger Woods, was at the slopes to support her. Above, Vonn and Woods are pictured kissing after the women's giant slalom in Colorado on February 12

Vonn was pictured beaming widely and waving at the crowd as she celebrated in the finish area after her win. It is unclear whether her boyfriend, golfer Tiger Woods, was at the slopes to support her.

Last month, Woods, a 14-time major champion and former world number one, announced he was taking a break from the sport that has made him millions after suffering a back injury in California.

He and Vonn have become a high-profile celebrity couple since they started dating two years ago. The pair were seen kissing after the women's giant slalom in Beaver Creek, Colorado, last month.

Today, Vonn came in .20 seconds ahead of overall World Cup leader, Tina Maze, of Slovenia, who placed second. Meanwhile, Anna Fenninger, of Austria, was .36 back in third.

'It's going to be a close fight. I'll have to ski my best and I hope I can get two titles,' said Vonn, who is also chasing the downhill crown and could equal Katja Seizinger's record of five Super-G titles.

Shortly after Vonn's win, former German World Cup alpine ski racer, Maria Höfl-Riesch, posted a photo of herself and the skier on Twitter.

She captioned the image: 'Dinner with the winner. Good job @lindseyvonn.'

Maze's second place finish increase her lead over Fenninger overall to 44 points.

'She has been putting a lot of pressure on me. I knew I had a good run,' said Maze, whose coach set the course.

She added: 'It's in difficult moments that you can show your character and I did today.'

Fenninger had won back-to-back races in Bulgaria last weekend and finished ahead of Maze in Saturday's downhill, when she was second and the Slovenian third, cutting into Maze's overall lead.

'I saw that Tina had a great run so I had to take risks and it was close,' Fenninger said. 'It was a fast race, with broad turns.'

Vonn is the only female skier to have won more than one Super-G race on the demanding Kandahar course in Garmisch. She also took the races in 2009 and 2010.

She has now won five races in Garmisch. The American also has the sole possession of second place with the number of top-three finishes on the World Cup circuit - a total of 111.

The figure is just three behind the record of 114, held by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria.

Long-term relationship: Vonn and Woods (pictured together during the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships in Colorado in February) have become a high-profile celebrity couple since they started dating two years ago
