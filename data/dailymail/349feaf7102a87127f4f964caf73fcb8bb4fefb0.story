You don't need helicopters, diamond rings, Lamborghinis or designer watches to enjoy yourself. 

That's the message from a group of Romanians who have taken to social media to spoof the Rich Kids of Instagram - a notorious account on which members post flashy pictures of their impossibly wealthy, sun-drenched lives.

Their Romanian counterparts have come up with their own versions of images posted by the more moneyed Instagrammers.

The campaign is aimed at showing you don't need to have lots of money to enjoy good food

They include a toy helicopter replacing a real one, an old style rotary telephone instead of a jewel-encrusted smartphone and a plaster with a diamond drawn on it rather than a diamond ring.

The idea came from a Kentucky Fried Chicken campaign aimed at showing you don't need to have lots of money to eat well. 

KFC however invited Romanian teenagers to send in their own versions of the Rich Kids of Instagram snaps, minus the obvious signs of money and the expensive things that it buys.

Romanian KFC fans who took part in the campaign also replaced  lions with cats, infinity pools with inflatable ones and supercars with toy cars.

They then posted them under the hashtag #distractiepebaniputini, which translates from the Romanian as 'fun with little money'.

The reptile on the right looks considerably less threatening than the one on the left - maybe because it's a toy 

The Romanian may not have had a baby big cat (right), but they boasted a similarly hirsute equivalent (right)
