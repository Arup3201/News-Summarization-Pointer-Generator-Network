Prices of Italian wine are expected to rise in UK supermarkets due to a 15% drop in wine production 

Italian wine makers are facing their worst harvest for 50 years, after record summer rains decimated the crop.

With sick plants and up to a third less quality grapes on the vine in some areas, prices are expected to rise in UK supermarkets.

The vineyards are on track to produce 41m hectolitres of wine this year, a 15 per cent drop on last year's harvest, the Ministry of Agriculture said.

It means Italy is on track to lose its crown to France as the world’s biggest wine producer.

After a washout summer, Puglia and Sicily in the south are set to be the worst hit regions, with production down by a third.

Only some central areas will see a small rise, with the harvest falling across the whole north of the country.

‘2014 risks being classified it the most meagre harvest since 1950,’ Coldiretti, the country's biggest agricultural association said.

Prosecco farmers have had to work very hard throughout August to maintain the quality of the grapes.

Enologist Arturo Ziliani said :‘We have had a scrupulous cull of the grapes on the vine necessary to preserve the quality of the vintage.

'As a result we expect a fall in quantity of around 30 per cent. ‘

Only one fifth of the grapes have so far been picked, Coldiretti said, with the harvest set to continue to November as some grapes ripen late.

Ziliani said: ‘We will remember 2014 as the latest harvest in 15 years. ‘

Some vineyards have refused to produce their best wines this year, not wishing to compromise on quality.

Experts said that prices hikes due to will generally be passed on to consumers.

Barolo will rise to around 800 Euro per hundred litres while Pinot Grigio will see a modest rise, an investigation by Italian website Wine News predicted.

But the consortia of Prosecco producers said the cost of a glass of bubbly will stay the same-it will not pass on the costs of lower production to consumers.
