Ting Fang, 25, was found murdered in an Adelaide city hotel room with a slashed neck on New Year's Day

Chungaung Piao, 27, of Allenby Gardens, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court two days after he was arrested. He has been charged with Fang's murder

Ms Fang was found deceased in the hotel room with her neck slashed open.

The court heard that, 'there was an extremely serious injury to (Ms Fang's) neck, both her (internal and external) jugular veins were cut,' she said. 

Police at the time said she had been in Adelaide for three or four days. It's understood she was working as a sex worker.

Prosecutor Lucy Boord alleged that Piao's fingerprint was found on the victim's shoe, according to the Adelaide Advertiser.  

Defence lawyer Julian Kelly said Piao denied involvement in the murder.

Ms Fang was found deceased in the Hotel Grand Chancellor Hotel when the hallway and the level below her twelfth-floor apartment began to flood. A tap was running in the room where she'd been killed

'My client voluntarily attended the police station on Saturday night... the fingerprint as I understand was found on a shoe, which is not inconsistent with his version of events to police,' Mr Kelly said.

The court heard that Piao is married with an eight-month-old son.

He is a Chinese national and has been living in Australia for four years on a bridging visa. 

For this reason, the magistrate Luke Davis ruled that Piao is a flight risk and he was refused bail, according to the Advertiser.

The 27-year-old was seeking release on home detention bail so he could return to his family.

Piao was remanded in custody until January 19 when he will formally apply for bail.

The man who has been charged with her murder, Chungaung Piao, is a 27-year-old father-of-one who is from Allenby Gardens in Adelaide's west
