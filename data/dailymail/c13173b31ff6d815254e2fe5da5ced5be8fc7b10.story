In the course of their murderous rampage yesterday in Paris, two of the Islamist shooters announced that they were acting in the name of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP, the affiliate of Al Qaeda that operates in Yemen.

Formed in 2009, AQAP merged existing Yemeni and Saudi jihadists after the Saudi Kingdom became too unsafe for them and they fled southwards.

This suggests that AQAP feels eclipsed by ISIS, which has attracted so much coverage since last summer, and is determined to put itself back in the international spotlight with this act of mass murder, in broad daylight, in a major European capital.

There is a proven link between AQAP and the gunmen's choice of target since AQAP's online magazine 'Inspire' recently included the editor-in-chief of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a list of 'unbelievers' deserving a bullet.

AQAP also has a track record of mounting attacks on western targets, and has its own Foreign Operations Unit to train terrorists who can convincingly pass themselves off in foreign contexts.

There is a direct personal link between AQAP and core Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Its leader, Nasir Abdel Karim al- Wuhayshi, served four years as Osama bin Laden's aide de camp and then became Ayman al-Zawahiri's 'general manager' thereafter. After three years in a Yemeni jail, in 2006 Wuhayshi escaped and has led AQAP ever since. Attacks on the 'far enemy' as they call the West, are integral to Al Qaeda's strategy, since it undermines western support for the local regimes Al Qaeda wishes to destroy.

Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Yemen is almost ideally suited for terrorist groups to operate. It is a wild place, with vast and rugged desert wastelands, including the Hadramaut region in the north east where the family of Osama bin Laden originated from before they emigrated to Saudi Arabia. 

Yemen is the poorest Arab state, not least because its modest oil reserves are almost totally exhausted. So too is the country's water supply, with so much of it diverted into growing the leaf narcotic qat which Yemeni men chew obsessively throughout the afternoons.

The capital, Sana'a will soon be the first city in the world to run out of water as the aquifers empty.

The politics of Yemen are desperate too, with government compared with dancing on the heads of snakes. Its long time dictator, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, was ousted in February 2012, leaving what amounts to a power vacuum.

The country was already faced with two secessionist insurgencies in north and south. One of these involves the Iranian-backed Houthis, who come from the country's large Shia minority in a country that is predominantly Sunni.

The Sunnis are backed by Saudi Arabia which is so worried by its disturbed southern neighbor as to construct a huge fence along the heavily patrolled border. This has not checked the Houthi advance.

Recently, the triumphal Houthis virtually hijacked the weak government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and took control the capital. The Shia Houthis are waging a violent struggle against the Sunni AQAP, with almost daily bomb attacks, like the one which on Wednesday killed 38 would-be recruits at Sana'a's police training academy. Drive by shootings of intelligence and police officers by AQAP gunmen are also becoming more frequent.

Intelligence officers have been told the brothers attended jihadi training camps in Yemen overseen by Al Qaeda – one is believed to have made two visits, stopping initially in the capital Sanaa.

They are said to be checking whether he went there to study.

Al Qaeda operates several remote training camps in the east of Yemen that have been the target of US-led drone attacks and where trainers have taught Europeans, including Britons and French nationals.

Detectives are trying to confirm the information and seeking to check whether the brothers had received military training in Algeria with militant groups.

Both men operated during the Charlie Hebdo shooting with military expertise and precision, using classic tactics when leaving the building and running down the street – one covering the other throughout.

They did not waste bullets, firing individual shots or short bursts displaying a calmness that suggested both had previously been in combat, possibly as part of Al Qaeda units fighting Yemen’s Army in the east of the country.

For in these grim circumstances, AQAP has prospered. The wildness of Yemen provides plenty of remote places to use as training camps, where the group's highly proficient bomb makers can practice their craft.

Here they receive basic and then more advanced infantry training of the kind used to devastating effect in Paris yesterday. Covering their advance by sweeping their guns left and right, the two gunmen used single shots rather than blasting away indiscriminately.

One of them simply said 'OK Chief' as he murdered a wounded policeman lying helpless on the pavement. These camps were responsible for training both the 'underpants' bomber Abdulmutallab who attempted to blow himself up on a trans-Atlantic flight on Christmas day 2009, and a year later for a sophisticated attempt to smuggle bombs hidden in printers on cargo planes bound for the US in order to kill designated Jewish targets in Chicago.

Since the Yemeni armed forces are largely deployed combating separatist rebels, the US has had little choice other than to strike these terrorists with drones, especially since they lurk in inaccessible regions.

Some of these strikes have killed considerable numbers of women and children since AQAP terrorists and trainers are often accompanied by dependent family members. That in turn magnifies sympathy for the group within the wider Yemeni population. So although nothing seems to connect a wild tribal society on the verge of ruin with the deaths of witty and sophisticated writers and cartoonists in the 'city of light', unfortunately globalization means that just such a connection exists and it is lethal.

And unlike ISIS, which so far has simply incited random individuals to carry out low level attacks involving using cars or knives as weapons, AQAP can evidently mount carefully planned operations, in which the professionalism of the attackers is as evident as their implacable religious fanatacism.

The gunmen being hunted by police over the Charlie Hebdo attack are believed to be from militant group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

The group was established by Yusef al-Ayeri in 2003 in Saudi Arabia, but was forced to flee to Yemen after a series of attacks drove them back.

Yemen's weak government allowed the group to rally and gain members, though they are only thought to have around 400 troops today.

While their attacks initially focused on targets in the Middle East, such as an attempted suicide attack on Saudi Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, they quickly spread to Western targets.

On Christmas Day in 2009, they were implicated in the underwear bomb plot after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was discovered on a Detroit-bound plane trying to detonate liquid explosives in his underpants.

The following year AQAP also took responsibility for a plot to blow up two devices hidden inside printer cartridges loaded on to cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the United States.

One device was discovered during a stopover at East Midlands Airport in Britain, while another was uncovered in Dubai.

According to Stanford University the group is currently lead by Yemen-born Nasser al-Wuhayshi, who is an apprentice of Osama Bin Laden and was imprisoned for a time in Yemen, but escaped in 2006 along with 22 others.

The group has a global jihadist agenda. Like ISIS, they aim to create a single Arab caliphate, covering Pakistan Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and the Levant - the area encompassing Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Israel.

If yesterday's attack is confirmed as coming from AQAP, it will be the first time the group has used lone-wolf style tactics, in which gunmen act alone or in small groups to attack targets.
