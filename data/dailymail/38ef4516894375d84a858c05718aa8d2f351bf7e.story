Paedophile: Operation Yewtree was launched after Jimmy Savile's decades of sexual abuse were uncovered, which the officer reportedly told BB producers was 'upsetting' and 'draining'

A senior police officer who has been working on Operation Yewtree - the
investigation launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal - is
entering the Big Brother house.

It is unclear if the high-ranking detective, who quit his job last month, applied to be a contestant on the
reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police.

Until recently, he had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex
attacks, either with the help of paedophile Savile or working alone.

Bosses at Scotland Yard are said to be furious at his decision to seek celebrity status on the back of Britain's biggest sexual abuse investigation.

Arrested stars include Jim Davidson, Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis,
Freddie Starr, and Gary Glitter. They all deny the allegations.

Big Brother 2013 launches tonight on Channel 5 with a 'secrets and lies' theme, which includes a prison inside the house.

His decision to become a reality star will shock Scotland Yard and producers
have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on Yewtree and
its 400 lines of inquiry was 'upsetting' and 'draining'.

MailOnline understands he will enter the house on Friday night.

A show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work
but understands 'it is only natural' that other contestants will try to get 'as much
gossip as possible' about the investigation.

Concerns: A Scotland Yard child abuse detective who worked on Operation Yewtree will enter the Big Brother House, probably on Friday

Revealed: The officer will be inside the new Big Brother house (pictured), which has been unveiled as producers gear up for this summer's new series

The man, who will be unmasked this evening, also spoke about the hours he
spent sifting through evidence linked to Savile's decades of sexual abuse.

He also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased
they had been able to make a difference to victims.

'The housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this. Leaving
the police force to go into the Big Brother house is a massive move,' a show
insider told the Daily Star.

'Their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join
the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the
house.

Ready for action: The theme this year is Secret & Lies and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison

Not long now: This year will see Emma Willis take over the main hosting duties to replace Brian Dowling, but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the Met

'This person has seen a lot of bad things while working on Operation
Yewtree. They will know what can and can’t be said inside the house but it’s
only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as
possible.'

New pictures released this week reveaed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the 
duration of this year's show.

Not only have producers added an 
outdoor shower, no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action, 
but they've also included a snug treehouse in the garden.

Suspects: PR guru Max Clifford, left, and comedian Jim Davidson, right, are among those arrested in the Operation

Arrests: Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck and Australian entertainer Rolf Harris have also been held by Yewtree 

Its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building.

Other
features include an outside shower, a 'prison' for any bad behaving 
contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom.
