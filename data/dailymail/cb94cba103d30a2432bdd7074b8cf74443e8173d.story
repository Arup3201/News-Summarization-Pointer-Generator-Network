They were the tortured souls incarcerated in the world’s first mental asylum.

The uproar, chaos and barbarism that surrounded them gave the place its famous nickname, which has resonated for centuries as a byword for madness – Bedlam.

Now the ‘lost souls of Bedlam’ are giving up their dark secrets, yards from one of London’s busiest railway stations.

Taking care: Findings at Broadgate ticket hall at Liverpool Street as layers of London's history are uncovered

Hundreds of skeletons, including the 
remains of patients from what was officially called Bethlem – or 
Bethlehem – Hospital, have been discovered in an old graveyard a few 
feet beneath the ground at Liverpool Street station on what is now part 
of Europe’s biggest building site.

It is thought the works, for the 
£15billion Crossrail project, will eventually yield up to 4,000 bodies, 
some dating back 450 years.

The graveyard, built on the Bethlem 
Hospital’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the 
city started to overflow, was used to bury London’s poor and religious 
non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum.

Discovery: The cemetery is named after the Bethlem Royal Hospital and holds many of its patients

Bethlem, whose name quickly became 
pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners, was founded in 1247 by Simon FitzMary,
a wealthy former Sheriff of London, as a priory dedicated to St Mary of
Bethlem.

By 1403, the majority of its patients were lunatics. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia.

Inside the squalid single-storey 
building that housed 12 cells, a kitchen, staff accommodation and an 
exercise yard, inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a 
tourist attraction by Londoners who paid a penny to stare at them. 
Patients, usually poor, were given treatments including restraint, 
dousing with water, beatings and isolation.

Conditions inside Bedlam were depicted
by William Hogarth in his 18th century drawings A Rake’s Progress, 
charting the decline of a merchant’s son from wealthy heir to asylum 
inmate, via debtor’s jail.

In 1676, the asylum moved to nearby 
Moorfields, then in 1815 to Southwark. Now the Bethlem Royal Hospital, 
it has been in Beckenham, Kent, since 1930 and is part of the South 
London and Maudsley NHS Trust.

At the Crossrail site, it will not be 
possible to distinguish Bedlam patients from other dead, as mental 
illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons.

In most cases, identification will be 
difficult, if not impossible, because although some were buried in 
coffins, any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read.

The 
dig’s manager, Nick Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology, is 
part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of
the 40 sites being dug up for Crossrail, the  73-mile rail line that 
will link the City, Canary Wharf, the West End and Heathrow to commuter 
areas east and west of London.

Major operation: More than 100 archaeologists have worked on the Crossrail excavations over four years

Anonymous: The identity of most of the bodies will never be discovered because of a lack of burial records

Overflow: The graveyard was established in the 16th century as the cemeteries of parish churches were filling up

Investigation: 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere

Mr Elsden said: ‘This site is a rare, 
perhaps unprecedented, opportunity. This is a major roadway outside one 
of London’s busiest railway stations. You don’t get to dig that up 
normally. Everyone’s been running around Liverpool Street for years not 
thinking they are walking around on bodies from one of the densest 
burial grounds in London.’

The bones, some from children, will be examined for clues as to how their owners lived and died.

There is already evidence that some suffered from rickets. It is thought other bones will bear the scars of late-stage syphilis.

Location: The cemetery is located next to Liverpool Street, near the original site of the hospital

Other finds at Liverpool Street 
include the project’s first piece of gold – a 16th century Venetian 
coin. It had been pierced, so it is likely to have been worn as a 
pendant.

The site also holds earlier secrets. 
Some 11ft below the skeletons lie the remains of a Roman road studded 
with 2,000-year-old horseshoes – hoof-shaped ‘sandals’ made of metal and
secured by leather strapping. Roman coins have also been found, one 
from around AD130 depicting the Emperor Hadrian.

Matthew Symonds, editor of Current 
Archaeology magazine, said: ‘What’s wonderful about this graveyard is 
that you are looking at a cross-section of society.

‘Historical records will be from the 
more educated and better off sections, but this is something that tells 
us how everyday people lived their lives. That kind of glimpse into the 
past is invaluable.’

Bedlam: The scene inside the hospital as depicted by William Hogarth in The Rake's Progress

The Bethlem Royal Hospital was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe, having been founded as a priory in 1247 and converted into a hospital in the early 14th century.

It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station.

Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally.

Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds, and conditions were not much worse than the average home of the period.

In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises.

Bethlem moved against in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum.

A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley - it is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.
