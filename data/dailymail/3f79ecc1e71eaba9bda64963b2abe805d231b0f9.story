Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised 'good government starts today,' after surviving an attempt to spill the Liberal leadership that he called 'a very chastening experience.'

But Mr Abbott's future as prime minister remains in doubt after 39 of his own MPs voted for the spill in the secret party room ballot.

A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the prime minister, with the vote count totalling 61 votes to 39. 

The vote count is considered so dire for Mr Abbott because there was no direct challenger for his leadership.

In a recorded statement released following the vote, Mr Abbott said: 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.'

'We are absolutely determined to work for you, the people.'

Mr Abbott is due to give his first statement to the media following the vote shortly

At a press conference later, Mr Abbott conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals.

'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 

'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government.

'And good government starts today.' 

Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters. 

Malcolm Turnbull - his potential  leadership rival - was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. 

Mr Turnbull has remained coy about his position and has not publicly challenged the leader. 

Today's vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago. 

Mr Abbott faced more grim news this morning, with a Newspoll commissioned by the Australian newspaper finding that more than 68 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.

Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. 

On a two-party preferred basis, Labor led the Coalition by 14 points, 57 points to 43.

The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994.

Mr Abbott began today with a visit to a Canberra church. It was a traditional service held at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting year. 

He told reporters afterwards that the government would 'get on with being the government we were elected to be' following the vote.

After grim polling this morning, Mr Abbott is facing one of the most critical tests of his leadership in the form of a spill motion this morning

Tony Abbott and his family spent time in Sydney's China Town on Sunday afternoon after he had announced the spill motion would take place in Canberra on Monday

Tony Abbott claims he has moved the spill motion forward because, 'the last thing Australia needs right now is instability'. However, others believe he made the decision to avoid an awkward question time on Monday

Senior Liberal figure Arthur Sinodinos has said he is very disappointed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to move the spill motion forward to Monday, and revealed he will vote in favour of a spill

The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. 

'I believe it will help precipitate a discussion', Senator Sinodinos told Fairfax Media on Sunday. 

He said he was 'very disappointed' with the Prime Minister's decision to move the spill forward from Tuesday to Monday. 

He said: 'MPs should be given time to discuss the matter at hand. Tuesday is the time to do that.'  

Treasurer Joe Hockey has said any Cabinet minister who supports the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign. 

Mr Hockey said he expected all cabinet members to reject the spill motion, but if they supported it they should declare their hand now.

'If I disagreed with the prime minister and if I believed he wasn't the best person to lead the team I would step down from the cabinet - that is the appropriate thing to do,' he told Sky News on Sunday.

He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 

'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. 

He expected the motion would be voted down, but not unanimously.

'There will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another,' he said.

The treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill.

'I think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the Australian people, not engage in commentary on gossip.'

Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest.

'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Sydney on Sunday

Mr Turnbull has only voiced his opposition to Mr Abbott moving the vote forward, labelling it a 'captain's call' - what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions, including knighting Prince Philip. 

Mr Turnbull said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal.

'If, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant,' he said outside his home on Sunday.  

On Sunday Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them.

'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 

'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' 

Turnbull has refused to deny he will challenge the Prime Minister for leadership of the Liberal party, and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant

Malcolm Turnbull refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports Mr Abbott in line with cabinet solidarity

As Prime Minister Tony Abbott battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next week's leadership spill motion, a new Galaxy poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters  want him to stand down

As reports that  Malcolm Turnbull will contest the leadership continue to circulate, the poll showed he would improve the Liberal's chance of winning at the next election if he were made Prime Minister 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against Mr Abbott, but still not as much as a Labor government according to the 53:47 two-party preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot 

There may be some hope yet for Mr Abbott, as sources reveal Mr Turnbull would offer him his support  on Tuesday if he were to be promised the role of Treasurer, dumping Joe Hockey (pictured) from the position

The Communications Minister took to Twitter this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader Julie Bishop

He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership 

Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister
