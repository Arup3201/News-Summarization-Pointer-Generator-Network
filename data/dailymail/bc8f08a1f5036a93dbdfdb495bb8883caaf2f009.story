The boss of this filthy sweet-shop which kitchen inspectors found engulfed with flies and filled with dirty pans caked in grease has been fined £4,000.

Mohammed Akram, 53, owner of Aysha Sweet Centre - which claims to supply ‘the North’s most famous Pakistani sweets’ - pleaded guilty to eight food safety offences.

Hygiene officials found food-pans caked in grease and dirty walls with peeling paint at the shop in Oldham, Greater Manchester during a routine visit last August, a court heard.

Dirty: The half-built premises had a food preparation area full of flies - and there was no soap or hand-drying facilities at the kitchen sink

Oldham magistrates were told how staff at the eatery had not put food safety procedures - required by law - in place, and that no-one was checking food was being prepared safely.

According to Aysha’s website, the shop specialises in Asian sweets including barfi, made of condensed milk and sugar, jalebi, deep-fried sweet pretzel-style snacks and nougat-style halwa.

Sentence: Akram, who pleaded guilty to eight breaches of food hygiene regulations, was ordered to pay a £2,400 fine and £1,575 costs awarded to the council - a total of £3,975

Fined: Mr Akram said hygiene at his Oldham shop had now improved

The store also offers savoury snacks including samosas, chicken wings and savoury rice dishes.

Akram, who pleaded guilty to eight breaches of food hygiene regulations, was ordered to pay a £2,400 fine and £1,575 costs awarded to the council - a total of £3,975.

'Members of the public should be able to consume food from any outlet with confidence that it is prepared using the highest of food hygiene practices,' said Jean Stretton of Oldham Council.

'Oldham council continuously and effectively monitors premises throughout the borough to ensure high standards are kept.

'But those who flout food hygiene laws will face severe punishment, like this takeaway has done.

'The safety of the public is paramount.'

Mr Akram said: 'I have been here 17 or 18 years now, this is the first time I have been in trouble over hygiene.

'I have now taken more of an interest (in kitchen hygiene standards).

'Inspectors have been since August and I showed photos to the court, and matters have now improved 100 per cent.'
