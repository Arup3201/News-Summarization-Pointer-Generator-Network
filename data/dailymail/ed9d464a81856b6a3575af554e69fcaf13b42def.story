The vast majority of students at British universities have experimented with drugs with a staggering 85 per cent at one institution admitting to have dabbled with illegal substances, a recent study has found.

Leeds university ranked the most popular institution for drugs users in the survey for student magazine Tab, with more than eight out of ten admitting trying them at least once in their lives.

Manchester (84 per cent), Liverpool (82 per cent), UCL (82 per cent) and Newcastle (82 per cent), all followed close behind.

Nationally, 70 per cent of students admitted trying drugs at least once in their lives, but only four per cent said they needed drugs to have a good night out.

The lowest reported drug use among students was found at Cambridge University where still more than half (57 per cent) of students quizzed said they had taken at least one illicit substance.

Rivals Oxford with 67 per cent also come towards the lower end of the list.

Students at Cambridge University were found to be the least likely to try drugs

Cannabis was by far the most popular drug with 68 per cent of those asked having tried it. MDMA, the key ingredient to ecstasy was the next most popular with 46 per cent having taken it at one point or another.

The next most popular drugs were 
laughing gas (45 per cent), cocaine (29 per cent) , Ketamine (25 per 
cent) and mephedrone (22 per cent).

(Percentage of students who admitted trying)

While psychedelics such as magic 
mushrooms (19 per cent) and LSD (10 per cent) were some of the least used drugs they remained popular drugs of choice at Edinburgh University.

Philosophy students emerged as those most likely to take drugs, with medical students the least inclined.

The Tab surveyed 5,126 students at 21 UK universities in the second term of the 2012/13 academic year.

However they point out the sample of students who contributed was self-selecting, meaning a disproportionately high number of drug users could have come forward. 

The Tab reported: 'Obviously we all know how much druggies loves talking about drugs, so you can take these results with a pinch of… salt.'

The survey found that 12 per cent of students had bought drugs on line, 20 per cent had a student dealer while 33 per cent had bought drugs from their friends.

The average age for first experimenting with illicit substances was 16 years and two months. 

Pete Mercer of the National Union of Students said he did not find the result particularly surprising.

He told the Times: 'Sometimes drug-use is a one off experiment, sometimes it's longer term recreational use, but sometimes it's a form of self-medication and a way of dealing with other issues.

'It's important that those concerned with student wellbeing consider why students might take drugs and work to support those that are in a potentially vulnerable state.'
