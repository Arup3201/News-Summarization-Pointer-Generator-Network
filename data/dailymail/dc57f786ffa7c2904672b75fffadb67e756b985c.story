Almost everyone has lost a friend a concert, only to find they either have no phone signal, or it's impossible to describe their exact location in a sea of faces.

But now there’s an app that flashes a rainbow of colours to attract the attention of friends separated from a group.

Users of the app, called LookFor, simply have to hold their phone in the air to display its full screen turning into pulsing colours.

The self-titled ‘world’s dumbest app’ costs 78p (99 cents) on iTunes and Google Play, where comments include: ‘How has no one thought about this before?!’ and ‘So simple, so effective.’

Users have to pick the colour of the light they desire then send their missing friend a message, saying ‘look for a blue flashing light,’ if they have chosen blue as the colour of their digital beacon.

They then simply wave their phone, the screen of which has been turned into a flashing coloured light, until they attract their friend’s attention.

They then simply wave their phone, whose screen has been transformed into a colourful flashing light, until they attract a friend’s attention.

The only problem may be, that if the app catches on, there may be lots of the same colour flashing handsets.

Retroproof, the San Francisco-based company behind the app said on its successful Kickstarter campaign: ‘LookFor is a quick and easy friend finder. And quite honestly, it’s simple. Dumb simple.’ 

It claims the app is the only friend finder that doesn’t rely on GPS, a data connection or any wireless signal, meaning it can be used anywhere, including in underground venues.

The app is fully functional, but having raised over $1,500 (£1,000) on the crowd funding site in May last year, Retroproof had vowed to add ‘location-based push notifications, iBeacons and a slew of other great technologies’.

The app works on iPhones running iOS 5 and newer and Android handsets running Gingerbread and newer.

The firm says it should also work on Windows Phone and Blackberry 10 and newer – and takes up around 3MB of space.
