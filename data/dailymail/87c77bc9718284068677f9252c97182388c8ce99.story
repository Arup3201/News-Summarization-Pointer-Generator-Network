There has long been heated debate about how often bed linen should be changed.

But new research suggests millions of Britons are risking illness because they do not replace their pillows and duvet as often as they should.

The study revealed that the average person uses their pillows for a year longer than is recommended and that they use the same duvet for two years longer than they should.

Some 82 per cent of Britons don't know that pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets, every five

The poll of nearly 2,200 men and women over the age of 18 found that 82 per cent of people do not know how often they should replace their pillows and duvet.

According to the Sleep Council, pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets should be thrown away after five years.

But, a study by Ergoflex UK showed that the average Briton uses a pillow for 3.2 years and a duvet for 7.6 years.

As a result, experts say they are risking neck problems caused by sleeping without enough head and neck support.

They are also at risk of health problems associated with dust mite infestations.

The survey revealed 57 per cent of people only replace their bedding when it feels like it is wearing thin.

Some 46 per cent say they replace it when they feel like it has been too long since they last changed their bedding.

Others said they throw out their bedding when they start to struggle to sleep or to get comfortable.

For 21 per cent of people it is all about cost – they only buy new bedding when there is a sale on.

While people are clueless about how often they should change their bedding, most are aware that pillows should be changed more often than duvets.

According to the survey, 61 per cent of people replace their pillows more frequently because they are aware of the hygiene issues associated with not doing so.

Jed MacEwan, Managing Director of www.Ergoflex.co.uk, said: ‘We can’t quite believe that 82 per cent of Britons don’t know the recommended time periods which dictate when you should replace your bedding, not to mention that the average Briton uses their pillows and duvet for between one and two years longer than they should.

‘Not only are they increasing their chances of having restless nights, they’re also risking sustained periods of sleeping without an adequate level of support to the neck and head, along with various hygiene problems that may arise from dust mite infestations in older bedding.

‘Independent specialists at the Sleep Council recommend that your mattress should be replaced every seven years, and it’s certainly prudent that duvets and pillows are replaced every five and two years respectively.

‘Of course this is dependent on the quality of the products you buy, and it’s possible to extend the life of your bedding by purchasing protectors.

‘We hope that Britons will look at the results of this study and think long and hard about the various risks they’re posing on themselves by hanging onto their bedding longer than they should – after all it’s a decision that will result in altogether healthier, better quality sleep.’
