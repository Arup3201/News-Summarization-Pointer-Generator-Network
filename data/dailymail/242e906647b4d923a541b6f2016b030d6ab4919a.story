Empty threats: Police say Michael Hamson walked into a Tampa branch of Bank of America with a makeshift fake bomb and slid the teller a note threatening to blow up the place

A Florida man tried to rob a bank on Saturday using a cellphone with a pen taped to it.

Michael
 Hamson Sr. was arrested after trying to pass off the harmless device as
 an explosive at a Bank of America branch in Tampa.

Police say the
 59-year-old walked in slid a teller a note that claimed he had a bomb 
then lifted his shirt to reveal a container with the phone and pen 
strapped to it.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff says the teller gave Hamson an undisclosed amount of cash before he dashed out of the bank.

He didn't get far, though.

According
 to WTSP, Hamson hadn't made it out of the parking lot when a security 
guard nabbed him and kept him there until police arrived.

Deputies on the scene may have found his face familiar.

Barely
 a week before, on January 10, Hamson had been released from the 
Hillsborough County jail on burglary, grand theft and dealing in stolen 
property charges.

On those unrelated felony charges, Hamson served three months.

He's now charged with one count of robbery with a deadly weapon.

Nabbed: Hamson made it as far as the parking lot of this Bank of America branch before a security guard nabbed him and police arrived to take hi back to the jail where he'd only just been released following a three month stint on a felony burglary conviction
