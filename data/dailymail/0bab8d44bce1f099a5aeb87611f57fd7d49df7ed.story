Two college students were killed and two of their classmates badly injured in a car crash as they drove home from spring break in Florida.

Brittney Gallagher and Courtney Miller, both 21, were pronounced dead at the scene after their car spun across the road in the Florida panhandle.

Their friends Diana Mitchell and Lauren Kane, both 22, are critically injured in hospital after the accident that happened on Saturday morning as they set off back to Ohio after a trip to Panama City Beach.

All four were OSU students. Miss Gallagher was driving the 2000 Dodge at the time of the accident, which ripped the front off the car

All four women were students at Ohio State University and were riding in a four-door dodge driven by Miss Gallagher, according to the News Herald.

Miss Gallagher, 21, was driving westbound on SR 20 in her 2000 Neon, and drifted into eastbound traffic.According to the Florida Highway Patrol crash report, she ‘aggressively’ veered back into the westbound lane.

She then tried to correct the car’s direction a second time and made the vehicle rotate counter clockwise, the report states.

Miss Gallagher, a lacrosse-playing graduate of Lake Catholic High School in Mentor, lived in Willougby, Ohio, and was majoring in consumer and family financial services.

Miss Miller, who was in the front passenger seat, a former cheerleader at Niles McKinley High School, was on the dean's list at OSU where she majored in education.

Her parents, Robert and Lisa Miller, of Niles, Ohio, said their daughter had hoped to become a teacher or school administrator.

Mr Miller said: 'She was very happy, outgoing and loving - she was a joy to be around.'

Lauren Kane, 22, one of the Miss Gallagher's passengers, is in a critical condition in hospital after Saturday's accident near Ebro, Florida

He said his daughter, who leaves an older sister, Lauren, and younger sister Gabriella, was 'very proud to be an OSU student'.

Family friend Robert McDermott, a funeral home owner who is organising Miss Miller's funeral, told the Youngstown News: 'Anyone was proud to have her as a friend.  She was a beautiful, bright and intelligent young lady.'

Diana Mitchell, from Solon, Ohio, and Lauren Kane, from Willougby, Ohio, are majoring in health sciences and pre-physical therapy, and biology respectively.

Both were taken to Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida, where they are said to be in a critical condition.

The driver of the truck, 26-year-old Kelly Porter, and four passengers, all from Oklahoma, were taken to Gulf Coast Medical Center in Panama City for treatment. 

Porter and three of his passengers are said to be seriously injured, while one passenger is being treated for minor injuries.

Authorities said the dead women had been wearing seatbelts, and added that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, which happened near Ebro, 16 miles north of Panama City Beach.
