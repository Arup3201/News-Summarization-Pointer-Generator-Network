In the dock: An artist's drawing of Symieon Robinson-Pierre, during his appearance at Inner London Crown Court

A scene where five police officers were savaged by a pitbull was described as like the 'sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar' as the case against the dog's owner went before a judge today

As the crazed dog mauled officers in a frenzied half-hour attack, its owner and a friend stood by and did nothing, telling them instead: 'You should have just knocked on the door', a court was told.

Symieon Robinson-Pierre allegedly ignored 
requests to call the dog off and instead went 
back into a house with a friend and said: 'Mate, there’s nothing we can do'.

The pitbull was eventually killed with four blasts from a shotgun - but not before 
inflicting severe hand, arm and leg wounds, Inner London 
Crown Court heard.

The powerful dog, which weighed 29kg, pounced on police after officers went to the house in Stratford, east London.

It clamped its teeth into one officer’s upper thigh and tried to drag him to the ground as another policeman repeatedly hit it in the head with a metal battering ram - but his actions made no difference.

When he eventually prised the animal’s
jaws open with his baton, the dog turned on him grabbing hold of his 
right forearm and then attacked other police in the front garden.

It was then Robinson-Pierre and another man appeared at the front door, Inner London Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Sam Brown said: 'One of the men answered with words to the effect of "we can’t, mate there’s nothing we can do".

'One of the men then said in a tone that was utterly sanguine, "you should have just knocked on the door".

'After these vignettes were uttered the two men turned around, went back into the house closing no doubt what was left of the front door behind them'.

Amateur video footage of the attack showed police clambering onto a narrow wall to try and escape the crazed dog, with the mauling only ending when a police marksman killed the animal with four shots.

The jury heard the dog left behind a scene of 'carnage' in the terraced street.

Mr Brown said: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of this event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give idea - carnage.'

Victims (from l-r): PC's Marc Merritt, Lee Bush and Martin Corderon, who were among those, on their way to give evidence against Robinson-Pierre

Robinson-Pierre, 25, denies four counts of being owner of a dog which caused injury whilst it was dangerously out of control in a public place.

The charges relate to the dog attack on Pc Marc Merritt, Pc Lee Bush, Pc Paul Garrard and Pc Steve Bones who were either attacked in the front garden or in the street as they tried to get the animal off their colleagues on March 22 of this year.

He is not being prosecuted for the initial attack on Pc Martin Corderoy as it happened inside the house.

Mr Brown told the jury: 'This case concerns a horrifying episode in central London this year borne out of a criminal failure by a dog owner to firstly realise the risk his animal posed and secondly to be in a position because of that failure to properly restrain it.

'Through no fault of the animal’s, its natural instinct manifested themselves in a terrifying display causing injury.

'No allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on these officers otherwise he would be facing very different charges.

'However, the conditions in which the dog was kept - the type of premises - the behaviour of the dog towards police officers in the house, and the defendant’s own attitude towards persons being attacked outside, are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in this case.'

'It was bolting down the stairs, posing aggressively, baring its teeth but not growling or barking'

Police had been at the property to execute a search warrant and had forced their way through the front door, the court heard.

Mr Brown said: ‘Officers entered and identified themselves loudly, as one would expect them to do as police officers.

‘There was silence and darkness. The officers that had entered the premises began searching it, going from room to room.

‘Time passed without incident, when out of the silence was suddenly heard the sound of rapid scratching.

‘The cause of that scratching noise 
was a dog of the pit bull type, one that I’m sure you are familiar with -
a powerfully built dog.

‘It was that was bolting down the stairs, posing aggressively, baring its teeth but not in fact growling or barking.’

The dog first attacked PC Corderoy, before setting on PC Merritt and causing him to run screaming into the street, the court heard.

PC Bush freed Merritt, but as he shut the gate the dog leapt at him, continuing to attack as he sought refuge in a police van.

Another officer, PC Paul Garrard, leapt on a garden wall to get out of the way but was grabbed by the ankle.

Despite banging the dog’s head in a door PC Garrard only escaped when he leapt on a car bonnet.

Others attempted to tackle the dog with riot shields, a fire extinguisher and batons but failed to subdue it.

Pc Bones’ grabbed the dog’s throat to push it down but had his hand and fingers repeatedly bitten before it was eventually restrained  with a riot shield and a noose.

Mr Brown said: 'For the first time it would appear the dog was under control. But only it would seem through exhaustion. At around this point an armed police unit had been summoned.

‘It was clearly not the declared 
intention for serious harm of suffering to be inflicted on the animal, 
however no specialist dog unit had arrived and the men restraining the 
dog were either injured or losing their strength from holding it down.

‘Indeed, no officer could be sure that the noose around it neck was or was going to be effective.’

A firearms officer armed with a shotgun then shot the dog three times but it still struggled before a final shot to the head stopped it.

He said all the officers that were bitten had to have surgery to 'repair the wounds to their bodies'.

Mr Brown added: ‘No allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on the officers, otherwise he would be facing different charges.

‘However, the conditions in which the dog was kept, the behaviour of the dog towards the police officers in the house, and the defendant’s own attitude towards persons being attacked, are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in the case.’

Robinson-Pierre, of Stratford, east London, denies four counts of owning a dog that was dangerously out of control in public.

The trial, which is expected to last five days, continues.
