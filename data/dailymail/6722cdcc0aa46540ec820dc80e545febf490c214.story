When it comes to faking it, the Chinese are in a league of their own.

They’ve invented pirate brands such as King Burger and Anmani, built entirely convincing Apple stores, shopping streets boasting Starbocks Coffee – and even entire fake towns.

One such copycat creation comes complete with red telephone boxes and a Gothic church – but it remains so deserted that some have dubbed it the real-life Truman Show, after the smash-hit 1998 Hollywood movie starring Jim Carrey.

In the film Carrey’s character Truman Burbank unwittingly plays out his life on TV in a fake town, only realising something is afoot when a stage light crashes to the ground.The town in China, which reportedly cost £500million to build, is officially called Thames Town and sits 19 miles outside of Shanghai.But despite being completed in 2006, its mock-Tudor buildings, cobbled streets and English pub remain desolate and many tourists liken it to The Truman Show.

Thames Town is now used primarily by middle-class newlyweds, who choose it as the backdrop for their English-themed wedding snaps.On entering the town you could be mistaken for thinking you had strolled into a quaint southern counties settlement.

But on closer inspection many of the shops on the high street - with names like 'Mike's Records' and 'the Fish Bar' - are empty.

A bronze James Bond statue is one of the few tourist attractions, while hundreds of homes designed to imitate Victorian, Georgian and Tudor architecture sit idle with no sign of incoming tenants.

Thames Town was built as part of Shanghai's ‘One City, Nine Towns’ scheme, which saw a cluster of satellite towns built around the city.

The Parisian scene is completed by grand European buildings, wide walkways, ornate fountains and statues. There is also a replica of a fountain from the Luxemburg Gardens in a main square called Champs Elysées.

Meanwhile, the feathers of US electronics giant Apple have been ruffled by the Chinese building fake versions of its stores.

Once such shop was spotted two years ago in Kunming in the south-west of the country by U.S blogger BirdAbroad, who noticed that ‘the stairs were poorly made and the walls hadn’t been painted properly’.

While this store was quite convincing, other Chinese fake brands wouldn’t fool anyone in the West.

As well as the aforementioned King Burger and Anmani, counterfeit brands in China include Owega, Heimekem, Odidoss and, instead of Sony, Sonia.
