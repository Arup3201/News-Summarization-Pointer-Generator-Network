A man who discovered his wife was cheating on him decided to share the heartbreaking experience with the general public by live-blogging the entire ordeal.

After discovering text messages from another man on his wife's phone, the wronged husband, under the alias  MyLifeSuxNow, took to online community Reddit to share his woes. 

He then hired a private investigator and kept readers enthralled with a blow-by-blow account of his experience until the final confrontation with his unfaithful spouse.

The anonymous blogger's story, which has yet to be confirmed by any of the people involved, began last Friday night when he found texts on his wife's phone. 

'My wife is cheating on me as evidenced by filthy text messages, I know but she doesn't know that I do,' he says in his first post. 

He says he has been married to his wife, Jenny, for eight years after they met  when they had both graduated from university.

He then goes on to say: 'I scroll up, and there are multiple nudes from both of them waiting for me to discover. Most of them are dated sometime between 1-4am (usually I'm sleeping then, smart) so I knew she was obviously trying to hide it from me.' 

'She's cheating on me. They talk about sex positions they want to try... and one short conversation about meeting up this weekend. 

'I've erased all trace of me breaking into her phone. I don't know what to do now. Jenny is cheating on me but we've had no major problems in the time we've been together.'

The hurt husband then asks fellow Reddit users for advice: 'Should I tell her I know? Should we split and file divorce right away?

He then adds: 'Goddammit I loved her. I have screenshotted the texts and emailed them to myself.

'I feel like someone has shot me in the stomach.' 

When his wife returns home, MyLifeSuxNow tries to act as if nothing's happened: 'It really sucks speaking to her normally, but I'm dealing with it. No sex. Also, I've found 3 excellent divorce lawyers for myself.

'Goddammit she's on her phone texting again in the bathroom. I can hear the send button being pressed over and over. It's probably nudes and sexy talk. 

'Jeesus this hurts,' he says.

He then decides to hire a private investigator to follow her, and gives minute-by-minute updates as he discovers the details of Jenny's affair with her lover Zack.

'Jenny met up at the front of a flathouse in a residential area and kissed a guy before she entered. It's Zack. Cheating confirmed.

'The PI is staking out Jenny and Zack's place. There will still be juicy updates if they leave the house I'm thinking so stay tuned I guess. I'm at a loss for words.

In the next heart-wrenching statement he says: 'The pleasure of our love lasted a few years, the pain that came of this will last a lifetime.'

He then continues to update the blog as the private investigator tracks his wife's movements.

At 3:27pm he wrote: 'Zack and Jenny are relaxing on the front porch, just talking and holding hands. My PI is super far away, they can't see him but he can see them.'

The next update at 3:38pm read: 'Zack and Jenny left Zack's house. PI is tailing them. Sigh. More suspense for us.'

Then at 3:42pm: 'Zack and Jenny are heading towards the Starbucks shopping center. Don't know why, I'm guessing they already ate.' 

In another heartbreaking update he writes: 'Jenny texted me saying "Hey babe, you wanna watch a movie tonight? Your pick." I don't know if this is related to any of this or if it's just to throw me off.  

A staggering 15,000 users of Reddit offered the man advice on how to navigate the situation, much to his appreciation. 

'Thank you all for the support these past few days, it has meant a lot to me,' he writes. 

Finally, MyLifeSuxNow confronts his wife: 'I can't type for more than a minute or two, but it isn't great. Yelling, anger, sadness, crying, a ton of crying, pleading, explaining, contradicting.

The last update, posted on January 18 at 5.51pm, reads: 'A huge part of my life is falling apart around me. 

'I'll find a way to cope.....I can get through this. I'll update as soon as I can.'
