The attorney for a 17-year-old girl charged with murder for her involvement in the shooting death of a Utah police officer earlier this year says that his client was forced to participate in the crime by her boyfriend, who was killed in a shootout with police.

Meagan Dakota Grunwald's attorney says she was forced by her boyfriend, 27-year-old Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui, to drive her truck at high speeds after he fatally shot Utah County Sheriff's Sergeant Cory Wride as he sat in his patrol car after he noticed the couple's truck was parked on the side of a highway south of Provo.

Wride, who thought the couple's truck had broken down, had stopped to help when prosecutors say Garcia-Jauregui opened the truck's back window and opened fire on Wide.

Life: Grunwald is 17, which makes her ineligible for the death penalty. If she's convicted, she faces up to life in prison

According to Grunwald's attorney, Dean Zabriskie, Garcia-Jauregui then ordered his 17-year-old girlfriend to drive.

'Her choices were reduced to either comply or give up her own life,' Zabriskie told reporters on Thursday.

Zabriskie claims his client is also a victim of Garcia-Jauregui, who forced her to participate in the crime.

Authorities,
 however, believe Grunwald was an active participant in the vicious 
murder and have charged her with 12 crimes related to the death of 
Sergeant Wide and the attempted aggravated murder of Deputy Greg 
Sherwood, who was wounded in the attack.

Court document shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in death on the I-15 roadway.

Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help.

Grunwald
 was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She 
gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a 
false name.

Wride went 
back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother
 and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's 
actual identity.

It was while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer -- which is when his girlfriend sped off.

Wride was killed on the scene. His body wasn't found until 45 minutes later - when a deputy was sent out to check up on him.

Deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over.

But Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend started shooting.

Garcia-Juregui hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood eventually recovered from the injury and returned home after spending 19 days in the hospital.

Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday

After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on the road near Nephi, Utah. 

Instead of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flag down a minivan for her boyfriend to carjack from a woman who was on her way home from a parent-teacher conference.

This is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime spree.

After abandoning the truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be coerced by him'.

The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. 

After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose.

Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head.

Justice: Grunwald has her first hearing scheduled for next Monday. She is being held on $1million

While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him.'

The officers kept the couple separated as they arrested Grunwald and prepared her boyfriend to be taken to the hospital, which displeased a dying Garcia-Juaregui.

'You not going to let me kiss my girl with my last dying breath,' he asked. He died the following day at the hospital

Friends who knew the couple told investigators that Grunwald was carrying Garcia-Juaregui's child and the two planned to marry in August when she turned 18.

On her Facebook page, Grunwald posted a
 cover photo which reads:' I'm just a girl who is in love with the most 
annoying, cutest, funniest, nicest, and completely perfect guy in the 
world'.

After their 
marriage, the couple planned to move to Mexico. They had been living at 
Grunwald's mother's home in Draper 'for several months'.

Grunwald
 had allegedly been buying meth for her boyfriend and tested positive 
for the drug after her arrest. Prosecutors have not yet said whether 
Garcia-Juaregui had meth in his system during the car chase but drug paraphernalia was found in the truck.

Grunwald is due back in court in May. If convicted, she faces up to life in prison. Because she is a minor she isn't eligible for the death penalty.
