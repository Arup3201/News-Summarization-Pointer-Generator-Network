Successor: Tony Blair has revealed he is still giving advice to David Cameron on his 'damned difficult job' in Number 10

Tony Blair is still giving advice to David Cameron on his ‘damned difficult job’ in Number 10.

The former Prime Minister said yesterday he had given counsel to his successor-but-one ‘from time to time’.

In remarks that will irritate his Labour colleagues and many Tories, Mr Blair said he was equally available to help Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

‘When you’ve gone through all this and sat in the seat both as leader of opposition and prime minister, you know how damned difficult both jobs are,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

He said he approached discussions with both men with a sense of ‘humility’ because he wanted to avoid being ‘one of those pains in the neck that’s in the back seat saying I would have done this or I would have done that.’

Mr Blair also took a swipe at Mr Miliband, warning he had to transform his One Nation rhetoric into ‘practical policy’.

He said: ‘I don’t think there’s a problem with the vision. I think there’s a big challenge with how you translate that vision into practical policy.’

A source close to Mr Cameron said the last time the pair met in person was September, although they did speak ‘from time to time’ on the phone. He added: ‘The idea that he is in and out [of Number 10] is complete nonsense.’

Mr Cameron once described himself as the ‘heir to Blair’ - a remark that alarmed Tory traditionalists.

His foreign policy has also taken a more interventionist tone - with British support for rebels in Libya leading to the despotic Colonel Gaddafi’s demise.

Britain was also quick to support French military intervention in Mali, offering troops for ‘training’.

During a visit to North Africa last week, Mr Cameron used language that was reminiscent of Mr Blair, calling the region a ‘magnet for jihadists’ and warning of a ‘generational struggle’ against them.
