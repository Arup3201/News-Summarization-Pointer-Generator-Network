Every gamer has lost their cool on at least one occasion after being beaten by a friend in a tense match - and one of the current all-conquering Real Madrid side got so frustrated on the PS4 that he smashed a controller.

Right back Dani Carvajal could not contain his frustration at losing a match on Thursday, with the result being that a large part of the device - including one joystick and the motion pad - broke off the front.

Midfielder Isco posted a photo on Twitter revealing the extent of the damage - and also outing Carvajal as the culprit.

Isco accompanied the picture with the message: 'This is what happens when @DaniCarvajal92 loses on the PS ;) ;).' 

Carvajal, Isco and their team-mates were relaxing in Morocco ahead of Saturday's FIFA Club World Cup final against San Lorenzo.

Maybe the problem was that the full back just is not used to losing. 

Real have won 21 games in a row and are now just three shy of equalling the all-time record, held by Brazilian side Curibta.
