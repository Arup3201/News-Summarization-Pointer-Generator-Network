A Bond stuntman has pulled off the hottest card trick ever - blind-dealing four aces while engulfed in flames.

Daredevil Steve Truglia from Wanstead, east London, staked his life against his magic skills as he went up in flames.

The 50-year-old magician - who had roles in Tomorrow Never Dies and Saving Private Ryan - called it the 'world's most dangerous card trick'.

Aces are wild: Stuntman and magician Steve Truglia performs an amazing card trick while on fire

Hot streak: Mr Truglia was engulfed in flames hot enough to melt tin

He said: 'The flames I attached to my body are over 800 degrees. That's enough to melt tin, so I had no room for error.

'If the flame had come around the front because of a change in wind direction I could quite literally have lost my face or a hand and never have never been able to do card-magic again.'

Mr Truglia, who served in the UK special forces before becoming a stuntman, pushed his skills to the limit to replicate the pressure of being an underworld gambling cheat.

These sleight-of-hand skills form 
part of his one-man performance in The Card Shark Show in London's West 
End, which tells the story of gambling cheats through the ages and how 
it has influenced magic.

Mr Truglia admits his friends and family think he is 'completely crazy' doing stunts like this

'If a magician makes a mistake, it's sometimes forgiven by the audience. If a gambling cheat makes a mistake, they will almost certainly lose their lives - and probably in a horrible manner,' said Mr Truglia, who broke the world record for fastest abseil over 100m.

'This was my way of trying to replicate the danger that they are under.'

Mr Truglia, who is one of only 300 
people worldwide to be an Associate of the inner Magic Circle, performed
the crazy stunt at Artem Ltd in Perivale, west London.

He wore protective gel and a kevlar suit to protect his body from the flames - but his hands and head were bare.

He
added: 'My friends and family think I am completely crazy doing 
something like this. But, then again, I have been doing this for 18 
years so they are kind of used to it by now.'

Brave: Although he was wearing a protective body suit, his hands and head were bare

Safe: Firefighters douse the flames after the trick is successfully completed
