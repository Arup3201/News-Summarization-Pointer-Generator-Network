A couple who once gave birth to another couple's baby after an IVF mix-up have now welcomed a little boy - who was miraculously conceived 'the old fashioned way'.

Nicholas Winton Savage was born weighing a healthy 7lb 1oz via cesarean section on Wednesday, bringing Carolyn and Sean Savage's brood to six - despite their battle with fertility for two decades.

Baby Nicholas, who was conceived naturally when Carolyn was 45, joins two older brothers, a big sister and a set of twin girls, who were carried by a surrogate and delivered in 2011.

The Savages, from Sylvania, Ohio, wrote a book, 'Inconceivable', after the mix-up that saw them give birth to another couple's son  and ultimately hand him over to the biological parents.

Joy: Carolyn Savage, 45, and husband Sean, 44, welcomed a son, Nicholas, on Wednesday after conceiving him naturally after years of fertility issues. Six years ago, she had another couple's child after an IVF mix-up

Brood: The couple already have two sons, Drew (left) and Ryan (right), daughter Mary Kate (center), who was born after IVF in 2008, and twins Reagan and Isabella, who were born via a surrogate in 2011

Carolyn learned in 2009 she was carrying Shannon and Paul Morells' child after a fertility clinic accidentally transferred the wrong embryo to her after confusing their names. Mrs Mor

Despite being advised to have an abortion, the Savages refused, and Carolyn served as an unplanned surrogate for the Morells, giving birth to the boy, Logan in September 2009.

'I already felt pregnant,' she wrote. 'I was never going to deny this child life, just because it wasn't mine.'

In the book, she detailed the pain of handing over the baby and her conflicting emotions about the biological parents, who she saw as the people who were 'going to take my baby away from me'.

The Morells, who have also released their own book called 'Misconception', have two older daughters.

Tough decision: In 2009, Carolyn learned she was carrying another couple's baby after a mix-up at a fertility clinic. Going against doctor's recommendations, she carried the boy, Logan (pictured) to full term

Growing up: Logan is pictured in April 2010 with his parents Paul and Shannon Morell. The Savages handed him over to the Morells just minutes after he was born. The couple have two older daughters

As she announced her most recent pregnancy in a post on Today Parents in June, Carolyn spoke of Logan, 'who I loved as my own and still think of and pray for every single day'.

In the post, she expressed her shock at learning she was now pregnant the natural way. 

'At the age of 45, after two decades without a spontaneous conception; after countless ovarian stimulation cycles, multiple intrauterine inseminations and more than five IVF attempts; after six reproductive endocrinologists threw up their arms, unable to explain why we couldn't conceive; and after one of those doctors accidentally transferred the embryos of another couple into me resulting in a pregnancy that pushed me to the limits of my sanity; I was pregnant — the old fashioned way,' she wrote.

'For me and many other women who suffer from infertility, that is the stuff of fairy tales.' 

She wrote that she did not have high hopes that the baby would survive but 'finally, at 15 weeks we received the results of our cell free DNA study: Our baby was chromosomally typical, and he is a boy.'

Happy family: The Ohio family are pictured together before their latest addition. Only baby Nicholas and the couple's oldest son Drew (pictured left), now 20, were conceived 'sponatenously', Carolyn said

Earlier this week, she explained on her blog, Mama on the Fly: Making my Way With a Half Full Cup, that the baby would be delivered at 37 and a half weeks, due to her creeping blood pressure.

'This little guy is coming a tad earlier than anticipated and although statistically he should be fine, you know we have a history of ending up on the wrong side of statistics,' she said. 'So, could you say a little prayer for our boy?'

The proud father announced the pregnancy on the blog on Wednesday evening.

'Thank you for lifting our entire family in your thoughts and prayers over the past nine months,' he wrote as he posted pictures of the happy family. 'Mother and son are doing great. God is good. We are grateful.'
