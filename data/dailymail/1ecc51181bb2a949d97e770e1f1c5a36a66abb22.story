It used to be the soundtrack to our Saturday mornings - the 'whirr, clink-clink-clink' of the manual lawnmower as it was pushed and pulled over the grass.

But in 1965 the Flymo, using technology from the hovercraft, came onto the market - and the British suburban garden would never sound the same again.

As a new exhibition at London's Garden Museum explores 50 years of gardening, we can identify the key moments of change, says curator Russell Clark.

The first garden centre opened in Ferndown, Dorset, in 1955 after its owner visited the US searching for ideas to rescue his struggling nursery business and returned saying he'd 'seen the future'. He went on to open the first garden centre café in 1961.

Container-grown plants were the key to making gardening an all-year-round activity. Until the early 1960s shrubs and trees were grown in nurseries and transplanted when dormant between November and March.

The first container plants were grown in recycled tomato tins, before the advent of plastic pots in the 1970s before the ubiquitous winter-flowering pansy arrived in 1979.

The mail-order seed industry, with its garish catalogues full of promise, went into decline - only to enjoy a revival thanks to the current trend for wildflower meadows.

Even houseplants have changed. 'We needed a 1970s rubber plant for the exhibition... and it was hard to find one,' says Russell Clark. But moth orchids, once rare and exotic, are sold in every supermarket.

The 1960s garden shed was filled with powders and potions marked 'Poison'. Although the pesticide DDT was banned in many countries in the 1970s, Gardeners' World presenter Arthur Billitt was a retired Boots' chemist who continued to promote chemical gardening.

His predecessor (and former Daily Mail gardening writer) Percy Thrower was sacked by the BBC for a lucrative advertising deal for fertiliser.

You had to sign the poisons register at a licensed dealer's to buy tins of nicotine shreds for fumigating a greenhouse infested with insects. And try not to breathe in - nicotine is a nerve gas.

Sodium chlorate, an effective weedkiller, was banned in the EU because of its toxicity. But the 1970s, and the TV sitcom The Good Life, saw a surge of interest in organic gardening, championed in the 1980s by Prince Charles in his garden at Highgrove.

The turning point for garden design, though, was John Brookes' 1969 book Room Outside, which advocated decking. 'Before that, gardens had lots of flowers, a lawn and a vegetable patch that was a hangover from the war,' explains Russell Clark.

'But then people started travelling abroad and eating outdoors, and the garden became an extension of the house and a sphere for personal expression.' It was the start of patios, water features and garden DIY projects.

And then came Ground Force, first broadcast in September 1997 and attracting 12 million viewers at its peak, which caused B&Q's sales of garden decking to rocket from £5,000 in 1997 to £16 million by 2001.

A 1960s gardener would be shocked that lawns have made way for driveways today, says Russell, and intrigued by the trend for ready-to-go topiary.

'It's about gardening becoming easier. You can leave the garden centre with an instant garden, which seems to fulfil a sort of craving in modern life.'

50 Years Of Gardening is at London's Garden Museum until 31 August. www.gardenmuseum.org.uk.
