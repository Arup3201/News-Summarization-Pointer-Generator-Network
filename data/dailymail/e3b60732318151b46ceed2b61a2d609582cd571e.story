Dnipro have rejected West Ham's bid for Yevhen Konoplyanka.

The Ukraine winger has a £12million buy-out clause so the rebuff was expected.

Manager Sam Allardyce is keen to bring in a wide player with Ashley Young and Wilfried Zaha at Manchester United among names he is considering.

Wide players: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is keen on Man United's Ashley Young and Wilfried Zaha

Allardyce has an offer on the table for Boca Juniors left-back Emanuel Insua.

But Big Sam could revert to back-up option Timothee Kolodziejcak at Nice if that falls through.

West Ham's season starts with a London derby against Tottenham Hotspur at home on August 16.
