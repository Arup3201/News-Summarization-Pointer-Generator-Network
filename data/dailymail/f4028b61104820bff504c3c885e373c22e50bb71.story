Kim Sears pulled out another stylish look as she watched her boyfriend Andy Murray today.

The thrifty 25-year-old carried the Mulberry bag she's had with her at each of her boyfriend's Wimbledon matches and wore a bright orange dress from High Street store Hobbs.

The 'Ada' dress costs £129 from the brand and Kim accessorised with a £55 silver bangle from Pandora.

Showbiz pals: Kim arrived with James Corden and his wife Julia

While her partner took on Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in the semi-final, Kim was up against Marta Domachowska in the battle of the wags.

Like Kim, she opted to wear orange today donning a blazer in the colour over white trousers and vest top.

But while they may have the same taste in clothes, the similarities end there. While Kim is a home counties girl who shies away from the lime light, Marta is a a professional tennis player who has posed topless for Playboy.

Kim arrived to watch Andy's semi final showdown with their showbiz pal James Corden and his wife, Julia.

The couple have been friends with the Gavin and Stacey star since Andy took part in a sketch with his character 'Smithy' for Sport Relief in 2010.

James told GQ that he 'adores' Andy and the foursome 'get on like a house on fire' regularly going on double dates to London restaurant Nobu.
