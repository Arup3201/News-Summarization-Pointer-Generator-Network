Pretty. Beautiful. Perfect.

If you want to get an idea of how good Kurt Coleman really is, just ask him.

The self-proclaimed 'most famous teenager in Australia' has more than 170,000 followers on Facebook and nearly 85,000 on Instagram. He told a national television audience he was Australia's answer to Paris Hilton.

'She's my inspiration, she's just like me, that's why I love her,' he said.

His social media accounts are teaming full of unashamedly self-indulgent photos of the 17-year-old Gold Coast boy, who also claims to be the inspiration behind Beyonce Knowles' hit Flawless.

Confident or cocky? Gold Coast teenager Kurt Coleman, 17, said everybody should be as arrogant as him

'I'm hot and I love myself,' he told his loyal legion of fans.

'People are really jealous of me, I can understand why, and I'll never change for anyone because I love myself.'

He said he takes selfies '24/7 because I love what I see in the camera'.Â

Target: Kurt said he is regularly singled out by 'haters' wanting to bash him

His jaw-dropping popularity has spawned a mini-industry, with businesses set up in Australia flogging Kurt Coleman-related merchandise.

The Kurt Coleman Supply Company says on its website it exists to promote 'the poster-boy to thousands of youth around the world for being who you are and not caring what anyone else thinks.'

'It's so funny, I can't believe it really,' Kurt told MailOnline.

'It's ridiculous, they're making money off my face, I'm going to get around to getting money out of them.'

The supremely-confident teenager said people approach him in the street 'every single day, sometimes it's scary, I have to run sometimes...I've been hit so many times.'

Asked if his online profile was an invented character or if he really does love himself, Kurt replied: 'I do, I love who I am, I don't think it's wrong.

'I think everyone should think they're pretty, it's literally OK to hate yourself these days.'

He said his confidence was not hiding any insecurities, adding: 'I do love myself.'

It's a tough life

Understanding

Internet sensation

He said a girl once broke into tears when he signed a shirt for her at a Gold Coast shopping centre.

Nancy Coleman, an unrelated Surfers Paradise woman, had to contact her telephone company after crazed fans kept calling her at all hours of the day trying to get in touch with the blonde internet phenomenon.

'We had to report it because of the language,' she told MailOnline.

'This was at 1 or 2 in the morning, nuisance calls, they couldn't believe he didn't live here.'

Kurt has appeared on national television in Australia.

'Everyone's obsessed with me,' he told chat show Studio 10 earlier this month.

'I'm obsessed with me and that just makes everyone else obsessed with me.'

Kurt's online discussions don't just focus on himself. He engages in social commentary and political debate regularly and recently offered up a novel theory behind the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

'The Malaysian plane flew really high in the air and out of the planet, that's why no one can find it, it went in to space,' he suggested.
