Radamel Falcao left Manchester United's Carrington training base on Thursday, well aware that his chances to impress at his loan club have run out.

The Colombian striker suffered an embarrassing demotion to United's Under 21 side this week and sources close to Falcao say he recognises that he made the wrong move when picking Old Trafford in the summer.

Despite his chances of starting against Tottenham Hotspur in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday seeming to be close to nil, Falcao smiled as he left the Aon Training Complex in his United-red Range Rover Sport.

It was a stark contrast to his expressions on Tuesday night against Tottenham's Under 21 side, where Falcao looked surprised and upset to be pulled off after 71 minutes on his latest poor performance.

And with Louis van Gaal appearing to show little belief in his deadline day signing, something else that sources close to Falcao have revealed the striker believes, he must have little hope of playing against the same club on Sunday.

With wages of £300,000-a-week and an expected fee of close to his £40million release clause, United will not take up the option to sign Falcao and he will return to Monaco - although there are expected to be other suitors despite a dismal season in England.

Come the end of May, he looks to be leaving Carrington - and Old Trafford - for good. 

Argentine defender Marcos Rojo was also at training on Thursday, and was  driving a Bentley Continental

Marcos Rojo, Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Victor Valdes were among the other players pictured leaving Carrington on Thursday, while Adnan Januzaj may have been staying late to put in some time in the gym.

The lightweight United playmaker told the Manchester Evening News: 'I do a lot of work in the gym.

'I am trying to be faster and stronger so I can be tougher when I go out on the pitch.

'I am doing a lot of short, sharp stuff so, when I turn a defender or go past a player, I can just get a few metres away from them with my acceleration.'
