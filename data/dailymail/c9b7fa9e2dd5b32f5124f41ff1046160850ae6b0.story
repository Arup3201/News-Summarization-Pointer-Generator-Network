Stephen Hawking's seminal book (pictured) is among the 10 voted 'most valuable' to humanity by members of the British public

Throughout history, books have disseminated the ideas and discoveries of the world’s most influential thinkers.

Now a new survey has shown that half of the top 10 ‘most valuable’ books – as voted by the British public – were written by eminent scientists. 

The poll by The Folio Society set out to select the most valuable works to the human race and authors of those picked include Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, as well as George Orwell and Harper Lee.

Two of the top three titles were written by scientists. Darwin’s The Origin of Species gained 35 per cent, while Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time gained 17 per cent.

But the Bible was voted the most valuable text overall with 37 per cent of the votes.

Interestingly, 37 per cent of people living in the south of the UK voted for Charles Darwin’s seminal scientific tome, but 41 per cent of northerners opted for the Bible.

The study, conducted by YouGov for the publisher, asked over 2,000 members of the British public which three books from a list of 30 they considered to be the most valuable.

The measure for selection was not by popularity or by the enjoyment experienced in reading the book.

Participants were asked to rate the influence and significance their selected books have had on the modern world.

Other scientific works included: Relativity by Einstein with 15 per cent of the vote and Principia Mathematica - a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell – with 12 per cent of votes.

The Double Helix, which is an autobiographical account of the discovery of the structure of DNA written by James D. Watson, also made the cut in tenth place.

Classic works of fiction also made up the top 10, including George Orwell’s dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which came in fifth place and Harper Lee’s classic To Kill A Mockingbird at number seven.

1) The Bible (37%)

2) The Origin of Species (35%)

3) A Brief History of Time (17%)

4) Relativity (15%)

5) Nineteen-Eighty-Four (14%)

6) Principia Mathematica (12%)

7) To Kill a Mockingbird (10%)

8) The Qur’an (9%)

9) The Wealth of Nations (7%)

10) The Double Helix (6%)

A total of 78 per cent of people picked their most valuable books because they answer fundamental questions of human existence.

Some 64 per cent of people said titles ponder the meaning of life and explore answers, while 56 per cent said they contain guidelines of how to be a good person.

Tom Walker, Editorial Director at The Folio Society, said: ‘The results of the survey highlighted some interesting dynamics, with A Brief History of Time on the list -surely one of the most under-read bestsellers ever written, - relatively little on economics despite the financial climate and only two overtly political, fiction titles in the list.

‘The first question I had was whether the similar figures for Darwin and the Bible does show a continuing polarisation between the realms of science and religion, or whether in fact it reveals a more balanced approach to ideas for the modern reader.

‘How different might the survey have looked a hundred, or even thirty years ago? How might it look in another thirty years – will Darwin have taken over; will the worrying rise of Nineteen Eighty-Four’s relevance continue; might the Qur’an continue to rise in significance in the UK; or might advances in DNA technology mean that The Double Helix grows in stature?

‘Is it perhaps a list of which books are perceived as having influence or giving understanding, rather than those which we personally read in order to understand the world around us?

‘Given the age of the majority of titles perhaps our greatest influence on how we understand the world is nowadays as much through media as through books.’

Just two works of fiction made the top 10 - 1984 (pictured left) and To Kill A Mockingbird (right), which the Editorial Director at The Folio Society notes are both highly political
