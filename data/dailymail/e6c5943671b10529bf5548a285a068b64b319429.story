A lorry driver has been jailed after being caught trying to smuggle more than a million cigarettes into Britain.

Polish national Artus Olszok was caught bringing seven massive boxes of cigarettes into the country, smuggled inside his lorry-load of wood.

Olszok, who claimed he was being paid only 200 euros (£157) for the illegal task, was discovered to have more than 10,000 euros (£7,900) in the cab during the stop-and-search in Dover, Kent, in July.

The 31-year-old was jailed for 20 months at Maidstone Crown Court on Friday, after admitting the fraudulent evasion of excise duty.

Alan Tully, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said: 'Olszok tried to bring an unregulated supply of cigarettes into the country that would have impacted on legitimate traders and encouraged law-abiding people to invest in criminality.'

In the last two years, more stringent border controls have led to the seizure of almost 3.3 billion cigarettes and more than 800 tonnes of dodgy tobacco - leading to 593 successful prosecutions.

Earlier this month an easyJet flight attendant was jailed for 21 months for overseeing a £200,000 tobacco smuggling ring - using staff discount to pay for scores of continental 'ciggie runs'.

Cabin manager Dennis Connolly, 42, of Southport, Merseyside, recruited friends as mules - including an easyJet stewardess - in one of the biggest conspiracies of its kind.

The cigarettes could be sold cheaply and profitably on the black market because duty had not been paid on them.

Speaking at the time, Sandra Smith, assistant director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: 'There are no excuses for smuggling, whatever your status.

'Tobacco fraud costs honest taxpayers more than £2bn a year, undercutting honest businesses, and drawing people into wider criminality.'
