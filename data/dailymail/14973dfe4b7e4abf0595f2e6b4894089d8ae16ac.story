A troupe of daredevil monkeys have been caught on camera dive bombing 30ft out of a tree into alligator-infested water.

The acrobatic animals showed off their impressive aerial skills as they crossed the Silver River in Florida, U.S., with some mothers even carrying babies on their backs as they belly flopped into the water below.

They pick a narrow section of the river to cross due to the alligators lurking below - flinging themselves as far across the river as they can before swimming to the bank and clambering up the trees to safety.

Daredevils: The monkeys were caught on camera dive bombing 30ft out of a tree into alligator-infested water

Acrobatic: Some mothers even carried babies on their back as they belly flopped into the water below

Intelligent: The rhesus macaques may have worked out the threat from the alligators is less because many have gone into hibernation

The fearless rhesus macaques were spotted by Scottish photographer Graham McGeorge and his wife Ellen on December 1 this year.

Graham, who now lives in Jacksonville in Florida, said: 'It happened in a split second so I had to shoot what I could - fortunately I had my camera close by and my wife was able to use her phone.

'I've travelled down the Silver River numerous times over the last few years to photograph the wildlife residing along the banks of the river.

'You're never guaranteed to see the monkeys so when you do it's a huge plus and a great experience - but this was something I have never seen before.Â 

Almost there: The monkeys then swam to he bank and clambered out the other side

Dangerous: The monkeys choose the narrowest point of the Silver River in Florida to cross

'The only way for them to cross the river is by swimming or attempting to jump from tree to tree on either side of the banks.

'But in this case the trees were too wide apart so they had to jump 30ft and swim the rest.

'The river is seven miles long and loaded with alligators - it's infested. Because it's beginning to cool down now the gators must be starting to go into hibernation.

'It's possible the monkeys have worked out the threat is less so are happy belly flopping into the water.'

Excited: Mr McGeorge said it was a 'huge plus' to see the troupe during his trip down river

Graham uses a friend and guide when searching for the rhesus macaque at the river.

'Captain' Tom O'Lenick, who has been running tours at Silver River for 30 years, added: 'They aren't afraid of water.

'The canopy was close together and so instigated by leaders of the troupe they flipped into the water one by one.'
