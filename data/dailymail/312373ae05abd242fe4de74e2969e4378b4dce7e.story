A poker player who cheated casinos across the country out of tens of thousands of pounds by making almost invisible dents and bends in cards has been jailed for 18 months.

Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, lied his way into casinos he had been banned from by producing fake ID cards and driving licences. 

Once inside, the unemployed 61-year-old would sit at card tables for hours, deftly making marks in the cards before using them to work out his opponents' hands.

The technique allowed him to swindle the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London out of £43,400 in just one week.

Lacatos was arrested at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton, in March 2014 after staff recognised him and raised the alarm.

After his arrest, Lacatos attempted to flee to Romania from Luton Airport but was caught in the departure lounge by detectives on 20 November 2014.

He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court today.

His conviction is the one of the first for ‘card marking’ - a technique which is thought to have made the skilled fraudster hundreds of thousands of pounds over his six-year spree. 

Lacatos fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham.

He used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled that his cheating went unnoticed for years.

The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. 

Prosecutor Michelle Fawcett said: ‘The defendant is a well-known casino cheat. He is known to mark cards at three card poker thereby causing loss to operators across the UK.

‘To facilitate his entry into the various casinos, knowing he had been previously banned from such establishments, the allegations behind the fraud in this case are that he used false names to register with the various casinos supporting his applications with counterfeit documentation on every occasion.’

She added: ‘Over the week of using the false identity at the Playboy Casino in London, it was discovered that the defendant had cheated at three card poker by bending or marking the cards.

‘The cards were notably aces and this bending of the cards enabled him to know when the card were being dealt.

‘The CCTV showed that the defendant noticeably increased his bets of £10 to £20 to £100 to £200 per game.

‘CCTV also showed that the defendant always sat at the first box position which is nearest to the shuffle machine at the card table.

Lacatos spent hours sitting at casino tables for making tiny marks and creases in the cards. 

He would always sit at the first box position, which is nearest to the card shuffle machine and the table. 

This seat meant he was given the best possible view of the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle. 

The poker player would then watch carefully as the pack was dealt, noting the creases or marks which revealed which card it was. 

‘This ensured he could clearly see the cards as they left the machine and fell into the dealing cradle,’ she said.

‘He was able to take a sum of £43,400 from the casino in total. That figure includes winning his bets back and the profit made by cheating.

‘As a result of these findings the matter was reported to the police, the packs of cards were handed over and were analysed and were found to have been marked.

‘That caused further enquiries to be made and an investigation showed that the defendant had been involved in various other incidents around the UK and had gained access to various casinos by using further false identities.'

Lacatos’ placed bets worth £25,200 at the Playboy club and won them all back plus a profit of £18,200.

Ms Fawcett continued: ‘Between 29 March 2014 and 31 March 2014 he joined the Northampton Rubicon casino again with a false identity.

‘He was recognised in that casino however on the 31 March 2014 - the police were notified, they arrested the defendant in the casino.’

Lacatos was cautioned and later bailed to return to Charing Cross police station for a full interview with an interpreter. But he failed to attend and offended  twice more while on bail.

Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than £40,000

‘The defendant was finally arrested on 20 November 2014 at Luton airport whilst about to leave the UK on a flight to Romania,’ said Ms Fawcett.

Police seized £3,500 from Lacatos who was carrying his own passport and ID card at the time.

Stuart Stevens, for Lacatos, said the married cheat was from the ‘very, very poor’ region of southern Romania.

Lacatos has simply printed bogus Hungarian and Romanian identity cards from the internet and laminated them.

‘He tells me there is not a big check at casinos - they want your money so they let you in,’ said Mr Stevens.

‘He realises his time of making this money is over, he wanted to get back to Romania, to his family. He appreciates just how serious this is and he throws himself on the mercy of the court.’

Sentencing Lacatos at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Alexander Layton QC said Lacatos ‘deliberately planned’ his crimes and used a ‘large number’ of false names.

‘After you had been arrested you attempted to flee the country, two of the offences were committed while you were on bail and you have previous convictions in Romania for offences relating to false identity documents,’ he said.

‘You have pleaded guilty to 18 counts - all of which were related to a campaign of cheating in casinos up and down the country over a period stretching back some six years.’

Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim’s Casino also in London.

He also fleeced customers at the Rank Casinos in Leicester, Stockport, Salford, Swansea, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Sunderland, Birmingham, Walsall and London premises in Victoria and Bayswater.
