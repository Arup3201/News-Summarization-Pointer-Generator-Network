Mitchell Locke, 20, has been jailed for 14 months after he drove his BMW around the M25 for nine miles in the wrong direction

A motorist has been jailed for 14 months after he drove his BMW around the M25 for nine miles in the wrong direction. 

Mitchell Locke, 20, was caught on CCTV cameras speeding down the wrong way between junctions four and two of the busy M25 through Kent and onto the A2 road, weaving through oncoming traffic.

The apprentice electrician from Kenley, south London, has now been jailed for 14 months and banned from getting behind the wheel for three years after he admitted dangerous driving at Dartford and Gravesham Magistrates' Court.

Highways Agency CCTV operatives had spotted Locke driving down the hard shoulder in his black BMW 120d anti-clockwise on the clockwise carriageway close to junction four at Sevenoaks.

'Shortly before 2.30pm on September 4, our force control room began receiving reports of a vehicle driving the wrong way on the M25, near junction four,' said Sergeant Rob Dell of Kent Police.

'People were calling 999 to tell us drivers were having to move out of the way of the ongoing car.

'The vehicle came off the motorway at junction three, the Swanley Interchange, then rejoined the carriageway and continued the wrong way to junction two.

'Still against the flow of traffic, the BMW came off at the Darenth Interchange and continued the wrong way by heading east, towards Canterbury, on the London-bound A2.'

Locke's ten-minute-long rampage finally came to an end when he smashed into two cars lawfully driving down a sliproad as he tried to get onto the A2 at Bean.

'The car exited at the busy Bean Interchange, heading into oncoming traffic trying to join the A2. Finally, on the sliproad at 2.39pm, the BMW collided with a Suzuki Swift and a Nissan Leaf,' said Sergeant Dell.

'For around ten minutes, Locke travelled the wrong direction on a major motorway and a major dual-carriageway.

'Where there was no hard shoulder he would move out into the live carriageway into oncoming traffic.

'It is remarkable there were no serious injuries.'
