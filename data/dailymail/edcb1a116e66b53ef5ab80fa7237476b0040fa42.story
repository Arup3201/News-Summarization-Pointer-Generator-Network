She is set to become the future queen of Spain, but one member of Princess Letizia's family has called for a referendum on the entire monarchy.

Henar Ortiz Alvarez, the aunt of the future queen Letizia Ortiz, made her feelings known on Twitter tweeting: It's time for the people to speak. Sign and retweet.'

Just one day after King Juan Carlos announced his abdication and transfer of power to his son Felipe, Ms Alvarez urged people to sign a petition on a referendum as debate about a republic heats up.

Crown Prince Felipe and his wife Princess Letizia make their first public appearance since King Juan Carlos announced his plans to abdicate on Wednesday - but they face calls for a republic

The close relation of Spain's 
soon-to-be King and queen, also retweeted several other tweets calling 
on a vote over the future of the country.

One tweet featured a picture of text that read 'this person thinks that the title of the head of state shouldn't be hereditary.'

However,
 when asked why she would want to abolish the monarchy by one of her 
3000 Twitter followers she replied: I'm not against my niece. Let's not 
confuse blood with politics.'

It's
 not the first time that Princess Letizia's aunt has made controversial 
remarks. Last year, in an interview with Vanity Fair she said her niece 
used to hold republican views before marrying her prince Felipe.

During the candid interview, Ms Ortiz, described her political beliefs as secular, red and republic.

But
 when talking about her niece's apparent change of heart since marrying,
 she told Vanity Fair: 'I think everyone has the right to change and 
become what creates most opportunity.

Her
 niece and husband Felipe have already gotten back to business during a 
public appearance shortly after King Juan Carlos announced his plans to 
abdicate.

Crown Prince 
Felipe said he wanted to promote a 'united and diverse' nation when he 
takes over as king, as he and his wife Princess Letizia visited an 
awards ceremony at an ancient monastery church in north eastern Spain.

But
 his wife's aunt is just one voice among a growing number of Spanish 
people who took to squares across the country to call for an end to the 
monarchy on the night of King Carlos' abdication.

Talk
 of a referendum in Spain has dominated Twitter and much of the debate 
after the news broke that the King would be stepping down.

The
 colours of the 1930s Spanish republic - red, yellow, and purple - have 
become prominent during demonstrations in the country.

Some
 people appeared grateful for the role that the King had played in 
Spain's transition, but still dispute the need for a monarchy today.

Juan Carlos is widely respected for 
leading Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and staring 
down a 1981 coup attempt.

His son's wife Princess Letizia, is a
 former television journalist and has been dubbed the nation's first 'Middle Class 
Queen' by Spanish media.

She and her husband are popular.

However,
 Spain has experienced economic difficulties and there has been a drive 
in the northeastern region Catalonia for a secession vote in 
November.

Opposition: Felipe's wife Princess Letizia, is facing opposition- from her own aunt Henar Ortiz Alvarez

The 
crown prince will become King Felipe VI as early as June 18 following 
Monday's announcement by King Juan Carlos that he will abdicate.

Juan Carlos said he plans to abdicate 
because his son is ready for the job and because the country needs new 
royal blood to lead it.

Felipe, 46, has managed to avoid being tarnished by scandals that have hurt the popularity of his 76-year-old father.

But his reputation took a big blow following a secret 2012 elephant hunting trip to Botswana at the height of Spain's financial crisis.

The trip became public after Juan Carlos fell and broke his hip, forcing him to take a private jet back to Spain for treatment.

The king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, is being investigated on suspicion of embezzling large amounts in public contracts.

Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, was forced to testify this year in the fraud and money-laundering case targeting her husband, an Olympic handball medalist turned businessman.
