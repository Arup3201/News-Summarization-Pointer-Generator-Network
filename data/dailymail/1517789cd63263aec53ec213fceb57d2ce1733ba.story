Britain's contributions to the EU have quadrupled to £11.3 billion in just five years, official figures revealed this morning.

It means each family in the UK now sends £450 a year to Brussels on average – up £350 from the £100 bill in 2008 – according to the Office for National Statistics figures.

The soaring bill comes before the latest demand for an extra £1.7billion, which David Cameron has refused to pay by the December 1 deadline.

The Office for National Statistics said Britain spent £11.3 billion more than it got back in 2013

Today's revelation comes less than 24 hours after Treasury analysis emerged suggesting the Government had expected Britain's Brussels contributions would be £8.6billion in 2013 – some £2.7billion less than the real cost.

The increase in Britain's contributions is because Britain's economy has grown more quickly than other EU countries.

The net contributions include the UK's annual rebate, which increased from £3.1billion in 2012 to £3.7billion in 2013.

In 2008 the UK paid £2.7 billion to Brussels - rising to £3.8 billion in 2009, £7.2 billion in 2010, £7.5 billion in 2011, £8.5 billion in 2012 and £11.3 billion in 2013.

In its report on the UK's balance of payments, the ONS said: 'In 2013, the UK made a net contribution to the EU of £11.3 billion. This was an increase of £2.7 billion from the net contribution of £8.5 billion paid in 2012.

'The increase was mainly due to the £3 billion increase in the UK's total gross national income (GNI) contribution.

'The GNI contribution is calculated based on the UK's estimate of economic activity within a budget year relative to other EU countries and can increase and decrease from one year to the next.

'The UK, like other countries, receives a rebate on its contributions to the EU, and similarly to its GNI contribution, it can increase and decrease from one year to the next.

'In 2013, the rebate paid to the UK increased £0.6 billion to £3.7 billion, from £3.1 billion in 2012.'

In the wake of the row over the £1.7billion bill, there has been a sharp rise in support for leaving the EU, according to a new poll by YouGov

The figures do not include the extra £1.7 billion demanded by the EU, which followed a reassessment of national incomes carried out by statistics authorities in each of the 28 member states, and led to large demands for extra money from Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and Greece, while countries including France and Germany stand to gain to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros.

The Prime Minister has insisted he will not hand over 'anything like' the £1.7 billion demanded by the European Commission, and Nick Clegg said the UK 'can't and won't pay' by the deadline.

The British government has been stunned by the demand, which emerged a week ago.

The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels.

To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling.

However, payments dating back to 2007 show how the payments to the European project have been quietly rising.

A major cause has been Tony Blair's decision to agree to a 7 per cut in the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal. It cost Britain £7billion over seven years.

Margaret Thatcher famously secured the rebate in 1984 by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back' during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France.

New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £11.3billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels

However, the rebate has fallen from £5.4billion in 2009 to only £3.7billion in 2013.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MailOnline: 'Thank you Mr Blair for sacrificing a large chunk of the British rebate in return for absolutely nothing.

'Much of the money that has come back to Britain has been used to make rich landowners richer (through the Common Agriculture Policy).

'The question is no longer can we afford to leave, it is can we afford to stay.' 

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, which is campaigning for fundamental reform of the EU, said: 'Despite David Cameron securing a historic EU budget cut, the cost of the EU to UK taxpayers continues to spiral out of control.

'We cannot continue to write bigger and bigger cheques to remain a member of an unreformed and uncompetitive European Union. Business is struggling under mounds of EU red tape and the UK economy is threatened by yet another potential eurozone recession.

'We must secure a new deal from Brussels and that will only be possible through a referendum.'

A new poll released yesterday showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the EYU in the wake of the latest demand for more money.

YouGov found a week ago that only 40 per cent of people would vote to leave the EU, with 41 per cent wanting to stay.

But now 44 per cent say they would leave, with only 35 per cent wanting to stay.

Nick Clegg travelled to Paris today for talks with the French prime minister to seek support for renegotiating the EU's demand for £1.7 billion in additional funding.
