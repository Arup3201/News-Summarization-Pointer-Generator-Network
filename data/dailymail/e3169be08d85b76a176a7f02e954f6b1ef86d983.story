For a couple from Iowa, exit 52 on Interstate 35 will always be special after giving birth to a baby daughter at the roadside.

Jessica and her husband Paul from Osceola, near Des Moines, were on their way to the hospital to allow Jess to give birth when all of a sudden she started having contractions.

'I had one at eight minutes and that one hurt and I said let`s go and we called his mom and got in the car.  By the time we made it to the interstate they were within three minutes,' said Jessica to WHO-TV.

Teamwork: Jessica and her husband Paul were en route to the hospital overnight to deliver their baby when things took an unexpected turn

Coming - ready or not! It doesn't quite have the same facilities as Mercy Medical Center, but it's where their child was born

It was to be the couples' third child so both of them knew what to expect - the problem was, they were 30 miles away from the nearest hospital.

'I had another contraction and I said ‘her heads out, we`re not going to make it there,’' said Jessica.

Her husband called  911 and pulled over on exit 52 in Saint Charles, just south of Des Moines.

The operator ended up telling him to deliver his own child while telling his wife to remain calm.

Welcome to the world! Gracie Lee was born just after midnight, weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces.  She was named after her unique arrival

Relaxed: The couple are able to smile and laugh about it now, but their daughter came when they least expected her to

He ran around to her side of the car and got into the back seat in order to deliver the child.

'She told us step by step what to do and I just followed her lead,' said Paul.

'He came running around and he said you`re going to have to push for me so I pushed once and there she was,' said Jessica.

Paul performed the delivery superbly and even had to deal with the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby's neck.

Exit 52: It means so many things, to many people, especially those living in St Marys or St Charles

Race: The couple still had 30 miles to drive to reach Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines when Jessica¿s water broke

She also had trouble breathing so he had to rub her on her back in order to make her cry.

Little Gracie Lee was born just after midnight, weighing 7 pounds 3 ounces.  She was named after her unique arrival.

'We decided that just by the Grace of God she was safe and healthy so thought it was kind of fitting,' said Jessica.

Unusual: It's not your usual delivery room

Unaware: Both mother and baby are doing well and dad says he¿ll never look at exit 52 the same again

Recalling: Paul says there were some anxious moments when little Gracie wasn't breathing and the umblicial cord was wrapped around her neck
