Victoria Vincent may only be 13 but she held her own against England diving team-mates 10 years her senior.

Vincent looked a little nervous at times during the final of the 10m event but withstood the pressure and tumbled from the highest board to record a score of 299.50 for 10th place.

‘I’ve learned so much and had so much fun,’ she said.

Impressive: Victoria Vincent came 10th in the 10m diving event at Commonwealth Games aged just 13

Signs of things to come? Vincent scored 299.50 to claim 10th place in the final at the age of just 13

Appeal: Team England had to ask FINA to allow Vincent to compete as they originally said she was too young

‘I suppose that’s all I’ve come here to do.’

Team England had to appeal against a FINA ruling which said she was too young to compete at the Games.

Vincent, who is in year nine at Plymouth College, is the youngest member of Team England. As her school friends were enjoying their summer holidays, she was training at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh.

Earlier on Thursday, Oliver Dingley won bronze in the 3m springboard despite having an injection in his buttocks on Tuesday to dull back pain. ‘I’ve not been able to sit down all day,’ he said. ‘But this makes me feel better.’

Dingley’s father had to beg for tickets outside to see his son dive, despite there being plenty of spare seats, presumably reserved for sponsors, inside.
