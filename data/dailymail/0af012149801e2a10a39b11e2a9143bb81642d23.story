A baby’s first birthday party ended in terror when the floor collapsed, sending children and parents plunging to the cellar below.

Birthday girl Emily Swift had opened her presents and was preparing to blow out the candles on her cake when disaster suddenly struck.

There had been no warning of a problem inside the terraced house until a large section of the kitchen floor gave way.

Emily was in her heavily-pregnant mother’s arms when the collapse happened and they were both saved from falling up to 7ft when they were grabbed by the baby’s two grandmothers.

Emily was said to be ‘screaming and very distressed’ amid the chaos.

However, children aged three and five, along with the birthday girl’s father Ryan Swift, 22, and uncle David Swift, 29, fell to the room below.

The uncle was credited with saving the partygoers from a more serious fate when he quickly realised the lit candles could trigger a gas blast.

The collapse had caused a leak and Mr Swift scrambled back up and blew the candles out.

Around 25 people were said to be at the party, but witnesses estimated there were about ten people in the kitchen when the incident happened

Paramedics treated seven people at the scene. Emily’s mother Katie Havrylak, 29, and three-year-old cousin Kellsi, who suffered cuts to her face and ear, were taken to hospital for treatment. No one was seriously injured.

Ms Havrylak is seven months pregnant with her third child and was given the all-clear by doctors after the check-up at Bradford Royal Infirmary.

Emergency services rushed to the house in Bradford, at 3.25pm on Saturday.

Around 25 people were said to be at the party, but witnesses estimated there were about ten people in the kitchen when the incident happened. Many were gathered close to a work-top as the birthday cake was about to be presented.

Emily’s aunt Denise Farby, 22, said: ‘We had put seven candles on the birthday cake, along with a big number one, and we had lit the candles.

‘We were just about to sing 'Happy Birthday' when we felt a bit of shaking and then the kitchen floor just collapsed.’

Mr Swift, the uncle, described the scene after the floor caved in as ‘pandemonium.’

He said: ‘The cooker was ripped off the wall and there were kids falling into the cellar. There was gas everywhere. People were pulling kids out of the hole left, right and centre.’

Shocked parents then realised the danger of birthday candles igniting escaping gas and Mr Swift acted quickly. ‘Everyone was trying to reach the cake, I had to climb over people to blow out the candles,’ he said.

Mrs Farby added: ‘Everyone is calling David a hero because he saved our lives. We are all in shock and grateful nobody was seriously injured or killed.’

Party host Ryan Swift, a warehouseman who also has a nine-year-old daughter, fell several feet through the hole, which took up about one third of the kitchen. He said: ‘When it happened, for a flash, I thought “I’m dead.”’

Describing the chaos, he said: ‘People were trying to hold onto the worktops to stop themselves from falling into the cellar.’

His little niece Kellsi fell the full 7ft to the floor below. ‘People were screaming to get my nieces out of the hole. I was getting them up out of the hole but I couldn’t pull myself up.’

He then used his phone as a light and climbed the cellar stairs to get out of the basement.

The family had lived in the rented property for about four weeks and one relative at the party claimed the ‘beams were full of dry rot.’

The house has been sealed off pending an inquiry and structural repairs and the family is staying with relatives.

Firefighters joined police and paramedics in the street, along with electricity and gas staff.

Phil Warden, Watch Commander with the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, confirmed there had been a ‘structural collapse’ with a cracked gas and water pipe as a result. He described the incident as very rare.
