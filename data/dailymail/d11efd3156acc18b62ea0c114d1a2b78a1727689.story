England look set to play friendlies against France, Spain, Germany and Holland should they qualify for Euro 2016.

Provided England reach the European Championship - and there is no suggestion they will fail to do so after winning their first five games - they will have a window for two friendlies in November, when the third-placed teams will be involved in play-offs.

The Football Association is looking to give England a real test during that period by taking on France at Wembley on November 17 and it then hopes to set up a friendly in Spain later that month.

The FA is also in discussions with its Dutch counterparts about facing the World Cup semi-finalists prior to the tournament, which takes place in France.

'We'll have four or five games before France, and each of those will be played against top-class opponents, we think,' manager Roy Hodgson said on the eve of England's friendly against Italy in Turin.

'We have Germany, France, Spain and Holland in mind.'
