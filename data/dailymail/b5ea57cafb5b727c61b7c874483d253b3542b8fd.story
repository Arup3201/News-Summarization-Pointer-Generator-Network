The fighting was as fierce as I have ever known it. Last night, 36 hours after world leaders agreed peace, a Ukrainian base near the front line of the war was being violently, ruthlessly pounded by those who wished to be ruled by Russia.

Here in Mariupol, the notion that conciliation could be found any time soon seemed ludicrous. This city is a key prize for the pro-Russian separatists. 

Fighting raged at the front lines on its eastern outskirts all day as the rebel tanks tried to push ahead. Ukrainian positions were bombarded ceaselessly by rebel artillery in a bid to hoist the Russian flag over the town hall tonight.

The deputy commander of the Ukrainian 37th Mechanised Battalion told me the rebels attacked 12 times. He expected the shelling of government positions that started at 5am yesterday to continue throughout the night. 

The officer said: 'Our scouts and intelligence people saw the enemy bringing up scores of new, modern Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers along the road from their positions at the town of Novoazovsk east of here.

'Why would they be hauling up lots of new armour if they were planning a ceasefire?'

Our conversation was interrupted by an excited voice crackling over his radio: 'The Russians are pulling up more armoured vehicles towards our lines!' The commander hurriedly left the room: soon there was the sound of heavy engines revving as some of the battalion's own armoured vehicles prepared to move out towards the threat.

Earlier, a Ukrainian soldier who had been in the thick of fighting all day at the nearby town of Sherokin told me of the pro-Russian separatists' dawn mass attack. He said Ukrainian forces replied with artillery and small groups of men with anti-armour weapons who moved forward to try to knock out rebel tanks.

He said: 'We had to commit a lot of our forces there to prevent them from outflanking us. We're managing to hold our positions but the fighting was hellish.' He reported casualties both among Ukrainian troops and civilians.

Europe's leaders are desperate to tamp down the conflict in Ukraine. No wonder: it has intensified dramatically in the last week, leading to real fears of a full-blown war between the West and Russia.

Ukrainians have watched their outgunned and outnumbered forces taking heavy casualties over the past days. Ironically, the one event of the last week that actually cheered them was the one that Britons rightly feel most queasy about: the advance shipment of 20 British Saxon armoured cars to Ukraine, with another 55 on the way.

The rugged vehicles, which are ex-British Army, have since 1970 transported soldiers through battle zones. Here, they have lifted morale. At one pub in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev on Friday evening, a table of people stood up as someone toasted 'Glory to the English'.

Price of war: Pro-Russian separatists stand next to the body of a soldier who died just hours before a ceasefire with Ukrainian soldiers was enforced

The Saxons have been delivered by a private firm which now owns them; but are a hugely symbolic totem of British material. To many, they represent the 'tooling up' of Ukraine by the West – the first palpable evidence of Britain having an interest in a conflict against Russia. Indeed, there is speculation here that the arrival of the Saxons might herald a split in ranks with Germany and France, which are steadfastly against arming Ukraine.

On Friday, Ukrainian President Poroshenko paraded himself proudly by one of the Saxons. Soon they will be fitted out with guns. What will the effect be of images of pro-Russian victims of British hand-me-downs? No wonder alarm bells are ringing in Paris and Berlin.

Meanwhile, America and Canada have indicated they might supply Ukraine with weapons if the pro-Russian forces break the ceasefire. Russia, predictably enough, has said it would view weapons supplies to Ukraine as a direct threat to its security. 

Vladimir Putin's position is, of course, absurd. He denies supplying weapons and men to the rebels in Ukraine – but both Nato and Western intelligence have no doubt he is lying. They say there is plenty of proof that Russia has not only been supplying the rebels with heavy weaponry but that Russian regular soldiers are fighting alongside the separatists.

US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, yesterday said satellite photos showed large numbers of weaponry being massed on the border with Ukraine and said that some of the tanks being used 'are Russian military, not separatist systems'. Pyatt added: 'The separatists now have more tanks, APCs, artillery and missile systems than some European Nato countries.'

So now the ominous question is: are we being sucked, day by dangerous day, into a desperately perilous scenario? Are we being dragged into the unthinkable: a war with Russia?

Consider this: the last time I was in this port city, last summer, I accompanied Ukrainian forces who took it from pro-Russian rebels after a short but vicious battle. Then, both sides were poorly armed, mostly with Kalashnikovs and a few mortars. Most of the rebels fled and about 20 were killed. There were no civilian casualties or buildings destroyed.

Now the rebels – who want to carve out a pro-Russian state and make no secret that they eventually would like to be absorbed into the Russian Federation – have Russian tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and multiple rocket launchers.

The rebels' arms can only be coming from Russia. Many western countries believe they are working according to a plan by Putin to rebuild a new Russian-led empire.

Those western politicians arguing for arming Ukraine compare Putin's actions to those of Hitler snatching Czechoslovakia, warning that appeasing him would only increase the dangers of more Kremlin aggression.

Others fear that it would be impossible to contain the conflict within Ukraine's borders and it would spill over into neighbouring countries that were former components of the Soviet empire but are now Nato members – such as Poland and the Baltic countries.

Putin was a reluctant member at the peace talks last week. Today will show whether he will risk edging Europe into an unimaginable conflagration… that is, unimaginable to anyone who knows nothing about the Second World War.
