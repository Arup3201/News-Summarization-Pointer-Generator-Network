During the doldrums of the football year, the Miami Dolphins cheer squad has taken upon itself to spread joy and goodwill among football fans, with a video of themselves miming a cheesy pop song.

The video comes after last year's 'cover' of Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call Me Maybe', during which the bikini-clad cheer squad mimed along to the song wearing, well, not much really.

This year's effort is more of the same, with the young women writhing around a beach in the Dominican Republic and miming the lyrics to Taylor Swift's '22'.

Strut: The Miami Dolphins cheerleaders have mastered the art of miming and walking at the same time

The spray-tanned and gym-toned ladies appear to be miming with as much pep and enthusiasm as you could expect from a bunch of professional cheerers.

The video, like last year's, was shot in the tropical locale during the cheerleaders' photo-shoot for their annual calendar.

Passionate: The girls meant every word they mimed, most especially this one, who appears 'happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time'

The girls have competition though - turns out this cheerleaders-miming-to-pop-songs-in-bikinis game is a cut-throat business.

The New Orleans Saints cheer squad has taken the miming and bikini concept and expanded it to include hamburger-eating, boxing and albino alligator-holding in the lush and swampy surrounds of Louisiana.

The fun-loving cheerleaders also included funny glasses, dancing on a hoverboat and holding crabs in their video cover of Swift's song.

In the inaugural battle for video-miming supremacy, NFL.com's Alex Gelhar has pronounced the Saints cheerleaders the definitive winners for creativity, camera shots and organization.

It remains to be seen whether other cheer squads will pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the plucky Dolphins and Saints cheer ladies this year.

It's also unclear whether or not the cheerleaders had convened to decide on this year's cover or if both teams just have impeccable taste in music.

Stay tuned for more songs by other people being inexplicably mimed by attractive cheerleaders in the future.
