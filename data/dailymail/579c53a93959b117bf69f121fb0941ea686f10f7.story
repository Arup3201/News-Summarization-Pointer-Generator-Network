A smartphone game that encourages girls to dress sexily and go on dates with 'hot guys' in the hope of becoming models has come under fire for promoting the wrong values to girls.

Star Girl, which has 1.3million likes on Facebook and was until recently aimed at children aged four+ on iTunes, is now rated 12+ but is played by thousands of young children.

It invites children to step 'into the high heels of an aspiring celebrity who is setting out to build her career as a superstar while having a ton of fun along the way'.

Controversial: Previously age-rated four+ but now upgraded to 12+, Star Girl encourages children to dress sexily and meet men in nightclubs

Values: Gamers are told they must dress well and date sexy celebrities in order to further their careers

Gamers are encouraged to dress their celebrity avatar, or on-screen character, in racy clothing from lingerie shops and to visit nightclubs to flirt with 'hot celebrities' in exchange for gifts.

The app, which is free to download but lets players make in-app purchases, tells girls: 'You've got the looks, but it takes more than than to be a star!

'Just remember that first impressions are the most important so make sure to wear only the trendiest outfit.'

'Hang out with your friends and go on dates with the hottest guys in town to find your perfect match.'

Players are told they have 'three main career options: singer, actress, model', and encourages them to 'Shop til you drop!  Flirt and go on dates to find the man of your dreams.'

They even compete in flirting challenges to win the affections of grown male avatars.

Melinda Liszweski from Collective Shout, a movement against the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls, said: 'The game teaches girls that the way to succeed in life is to be sexually appealing to men.

'Very inappropriate': Players of the Star Girl app are encouraged to invite men home with them

Critics of the game, which is free to download, say it promotes irresponsible values to young girls

'Having had a rating of 4+ this app will likely have slipped under the radar of many parents who have taken steps to make sure their children aren’t exposed to inappropriate content.'

Reviewers took to Amazon to air their disgust with the Star Girl app, with one describing it as 'stupid and vapid' and another saying 'very inappropriate - flirting, girls wearing underwear - I deleted it after a day.'

One reviewer, Sarah, wrote: 'This app is simply horrid. How can someone actually enjoy this?

'All this is is about are: guys, clothes, competition and nothing else... And, to top it off, after you seduce a male (for this occurs in many of the games) you take him home with you like a sad little puppy who can flirt.

Screengrab: The game has more than 1.3million likes on Facebook and is popular with school-age children

'I may be a seventh grader, but I can tell this is just wrong.'

One child wrote on Amazon: 'I do not have this, but my nine-year-old little sister does. The clothes are revealing and the avatars have very unrealistic shapes.

'This game teaches her terrible morals and values.  Once I even heard her say, "I have all my gifts. I need a new boyfriend."

'I don't think you would like your daughter to say that.'

Animoca, the company behind Star Girl, were unavailable for comment.
