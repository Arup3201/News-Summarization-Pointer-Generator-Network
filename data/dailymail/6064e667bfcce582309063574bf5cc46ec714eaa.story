Gifted: Rachel Jardine

Gifted, beautiful and bright, Rachel Jardine appeared to have everything going for her.

The daughter of hospital consultants and a former pupil at the £15,000 a year Badminton School, she won a place at university and the future looked promising.

But once at university she began to experiment with drugs and admitted taking cocaine, Ecstasy and cannabis as well as ketamine and diazapam.

As she studied for a Masters degree, the 22-year-old began to suffer severe problems with paranoia.

Her mental collapse tragically ended when she threw herself to her death off the top of a city centre car park.

And to add a final insult, her mobile phone was stolen by a sick thief as she lay dying in the road.

Yesterday her parents told an inquest of the tragic slide in their daughter’s mental health.

Her mother Annette, a hospital consultant, said the family had no idea she had experimented with so many drugs.

She said she was aware that at one point her daughter had experimented with cannabis.

‘I was aware that there may have been some smoking of cannabis but I wasn't aware of other things until after she died.

Mrs Jardine said her daughter, a philosophy student at Manchester University, began to suffer from anxiety and palpitations and ended up receiving hospital treatment.

She said that on one occasion she had phoned and appeared anxious and paranoid.

Mrs Jardine said: She really didn't 
want us to come and fetch her. She said: ‘I'm a bit frightened to go 
out, I feel paranoid and scared’ and I came to see her and I said: ‘You 
must go back to your GP.’

‘I said: ‘Let’s make an appointment’ but it wasn't in a bad way, so I thought.’

The inquest was told Rachel had first 
been to her local GP, Dr Archana Griffin in January this year and 
confided that she had used ketamine, Ecstasy, cocaine and diazapam.

She was referred to the Manchester 
Mental Health Team in March but by the time of her death on May 18 had 
still yet to receive an appointment.

Despite speaking to her mother, 
Annette, every day her condition worsened and the night before she died 
she called her mother again and said she was going to kill herself.

Mrs Jardine said: ‘When I said what's 
going on she said she'd had an argument with her boyfriend and that she 
was going to ring him. I said I didn't think she should but that if she 
did to ring me back after.

‘And she did ring me back after 
midnight. She said 'I can't do life anymore’. She said: ‘I'm going to go
into town and jump off a building’ and I said: ‘Calm down. There’s no 
need for anything like that.

‘I remember thinking there's no 
buildings she could get into to jump off and I said: ‘Calm down‘. And 
then she said she'd made her boyfriend angry and said something about 
integrity and she hung up.’

On the day of her death she phoned her mother five times in an ‘agitated’ state.

Heartless: Ben Heney stole a phone from a dying woman in Manchester

Mrs Jardine called her daughter on her mobile phone and realised she was walking in Manchester.

‘I had a long conversation she told me where she was and that she was in a car park and I thought: ‘She's serious about this.’’

She tried to calm her daughter down but could not keep her focussed.

When her daughter said ’Goodbye’ Mrs 
Jardine immediately called the police. The student was using her pink 
mobile phone to call her mother moments before she threw herself from 
the top of the car park.

Miss Jardine plunged 80 feet but as she lay on the ground with fatal injuries, drug addict Ben Heney, 23, snatched her phone.

Heney was subsequently jailed for 12 weeks for theft after his crime was caught on CCTV.

Yesterday Mrs Jardine said ‘We have no
animosity towards Ben Heney who stole her mobile phone and hope that 
the future is better for him.’

In a statement Mrs Jardine and her 
husband Philip, a paediatric neurologist said: ‘We miss Rachel every 
minute of every day and if anything good can come out of this inquest to
help other students who find themselves struggling to see the point in 
life then we will be glad.’

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Nigel Meadows said there had been no illegal drugs in her blood at the time of death.

He told the family: ‘Whether it was Rachel herself becoming low or a consumption of drugs you will never know.’
