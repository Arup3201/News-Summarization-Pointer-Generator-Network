This is the shocking moment a death-wish driver risked disaster as he raced under closing level crossing gates with a horse box in tow.

The jaw-dropping drama was captured on camera at a level crossing in Colchester, Essex.

With drivers sat waiting patiently in traffic, a mad motorist in a Ford Ranger pick-up truck can be seen overtaking the queuing cars on the wrong side of the road whilst red warning lights are flashing.

The driver gets closer and the  level crossing gates start to close, missing the horse box  as they come down

As the driver gets closer  the automated level crossing gates start to close, missing the single horse box by inches as they come down.

Had the pickup been a couple of seconds slower, it would have got stuck on the railway track and caused a horrific crash with an oncoming passenger train just moments away.

The incident was captured by a fixed onboard video camera on Martin Goodyer's work van.

 The 43-year-old security company sales director shared the footage on Facebook and has said he is willing to give the details to police.

'I could not believe what I was seeing,' Mr.Goodyer said. 

'The drivers were all sat waiting patiently in a queue as we had to stop to avoid ending up on the train track.

The automated level crossing is at East Gates and crosses a railway which connects the main station with the smaller Colchester Town station

'Suddenly the guy behind me in his pick-up truck with horse box pulled out and overtook me on the wrong side of the road.

'The lights had started to flash yet he decided to jump it - the barrier was coming down and he could have got trapped and stuck on the railway line.

'It was an absolutely crazy thing to do and I am just pleased it did not end up with more serious consequences.'

The incident took place just after 8am,  although Mr Goodyer's clock time shown on the screen incorrectly shows 5.08pm.

Mr. Goodyer added: 'We have video cameras positioned on our works' vans which capture four hours of footage in short bursts and that's why I caught it.

'I was so shocked by what I had seen that I put it on Facebook to show other people just what a crazy act this was.

'I've had contact from people all over the world since I posted it, so the word of what happened is clearly spreading.

'I've also got the registration details of the van should the police want them.'

The automated level crossing is at East Gates and crosses a railway which connects the main station with the smaller Colchester Town station.

A British Transport Police spokesman said the force would be investigating the footage.
