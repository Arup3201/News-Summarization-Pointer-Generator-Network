Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini praised James Milner's heart and determination and labelled the English midfielder a complete player.

Milner is one of few home-grown players in Pellegrini's first-team squad and could be set for a move away from Manchester at the end of the season when his contract runs out.

But the City boss was full of praise for Milner and his attitude and commitment.

‘It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [James] Milner’ Pellegrini said. ‘There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. 

'There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn’t one.'

Milner has played 36 times for City this season in all competitions and contributed six goals.

The 29-year-old has been in Manchester since a big-money move from Aston Villa in 2010, but his stay at Eastlands could be drawing to a close as his current deal is up in the summer.

Pellegrini added: ‘And whatever position I put him in he plays well: at full-back – which is the only place he doesn’t like playing– attacking midfield, wide, or as a striker. I used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game.

‘You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes. 

'It’s very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.’
