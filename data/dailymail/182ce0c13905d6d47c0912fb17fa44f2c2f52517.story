A controversial ‘Go home, or face arrest’ poster campaign is not ‘racist’ and could be extended across the country, the immigration minister says today.

Mark Harper launches a strong attack on critics of the Home Office billboards, claiming they are encouraging those who are in the country illegally to go on breaking the law.

‘No society that encourages people to break its laws can survive,’ Mr Harper writes. ‘That, however, is precisely what our critics are asking us to do. They say we should not try to persuade illegal immigrants to leave.’

'Go home': The campaign, piloted in six London boroughs, involves vans advertising a telephone helpline for illegal migrants who want to leave the UK voluntarily

The Tory minister adds that immigration has not had the economic benefits that Labour claimed, insisting there is evidence it has pushed down wages for low-skilled jobs.

The campaign, piloted in six London boroughs, involves vans advertising a telephone helpline for illegal migrants who want to leave the UK voluntarily.

But it prompted an angry Coalition row, with the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, describing it as ‘stupid and offensive’. Union leaders have branded the campaign a ‘nasty political stunt’.

Downing Street insisted the posters were attracting ‘a great deal of interest’ and confirmed that an evaluation of the pilot scheme could lead to it being rolled out more widely.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘This pilot that is currently running is about targeting [illegal immigrants] and it is working.’

Boris Johnson, mayor of London, defended the campaign, describing it as ‘blunt’ and ‘uncompromising’. 

He disagreed with suggestions it was 
racist, adding: ‘On that point I am afraid I have to disagree. Illegal 
immigrants have every opportunity to make their case to remain in 
Britain.

‘This poster campaign is unlikely, in itself, to solve the problem that expanded so massively under the last Labour government. But you surely can’t blame the Coalition for trying to enforce the law.’

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said it was ‘far from clear how any success could even be measured’.

He added: ‘The truth is this is not a policy that could or will be analysed for its effectiveness, it is simply a nasty political stunt by the Tories and it is a disgrace that the Home Office is allowing itself to be used in this way.’

A Lib Dem source dismissed Tory suggestions that the campaign had been agreed by a Home Office  ‘team’ that included Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne, saying: ‘We did not see or approve these posters, which we see as distasteful and not very sensible.

‘We would need a spectacular amount of convincing that it would be a good idea to expand this across the country.’

Labour said the Coalition’s success in reducing net migration was largely due to cuts in the numbers of foreign students and larger numbers of Britons emigrating to other countries.

Another Coalition row erupted last night as Vince Cable attacked Government plans for visitors from ‘high risk’ countries to be charged a £3,000 bond.

The scheme will see some people from India, Nigeria, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh asked to pay a cash bond on top of visa charges that allow them to stay for up to six months. It will only be repayable when they leave the UK.
