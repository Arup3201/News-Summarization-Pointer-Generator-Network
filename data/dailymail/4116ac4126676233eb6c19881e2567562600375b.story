What’s that about Valhalla being a burial ground for legends? Maybe in Norse mythology, but clearly not for those of the golfing kind.

To general astonishment and a fair level of hysteria, Tiger Woods showed up here in the nick of time on Wednesday and played the most watched nine-hole practice round in the history of the game.

Was this the man who could barely lift himself off a buggy after withdrawing from the WGC Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday — the one whose hopes looked buried amid his latest injury setback? Fair play to his physio. Whatever he gets paid, he is worth it.

Like the last major at Hoylake, the USPGA will finish with an exciting par-five where it’s possible to score anything from an eagle to a double bogey. 

A vast amphitheatre behind the green can accommodate thousands of spectators with the entire hole visible. 

Reachable in two but well protected by a lagoon that runs its whole length and a deep bunker at the front of a devilish horseshoe green. 

Woods was in such good spirits he even spoke at length with the media before walking the back nine.

‘The only good thing about Sunday night was that I knew the pain was in a different place from where I had my surgery,’ he said.

‘What had happened is that the sacrum (a triangular bone at the base of the spine) had popped out and pinched a nerve. Once my physio popped it back in the pain went away.

‘I feel good. I feel fit and yes, I think I can win.’

Asked if there was a danger it could pop out again, he replied: ‘Sure. But you won’t find me jumping back into bunkers any more.’

Woods didn’t play in the Ryder Cup here in 2008 because he was recovering from yet more injuries — his knee and a broken leg on that occasion — but it sounded like a Ryder Cup when he walked to the practice ground. He hit a 20-yard chip and 10,000 people started cheering.

Whatever happens to him over the coming months as he strives for a decent level of fitness, there will clearly be no shortage of people wishing him well.

After warming up with a little pitching and a few short irons, he reached for the driver. Uh-oh. But he swung fairly hard and not only did it go straight, he didn’t collapse on his haunches.

Steve Stricker, fresh from being chosen as one of Tom Watson’s Ryder Cup vice-captains, Medinah skipper Davis Love and young American Harris English accompanied Woods alongside the madding hordes — and that was just the media inside the ropes, wondering if they could trust their eyes. 

Empty space: There were doubts the former world number one would make it to Valhalla

Woods took a three-wood off the first tee and struck it true. The same with his iron approach and again at the second hole.

At the third he played his first bunker shot in public since jarring his back while tumbling into the sand last Sunday. But that went well too. He splashed out and holed the three-foot putt.

Beware the injured golfer? We will find out soon enough, given he is out this morning at 8.35 (1.35pm UK time) in the company of two more greats struggling to keep pace — Padraig Harrington and Phil Mickelson.

‘I think you saw out there that my speed through the ball is pretty good,’ said Woods.

‘It’s nice coming back to a place where I won (the 2000 PGA) but the greens are completely different so all my notes are of no use.’

The presence of Stricker was surely telling. People can say what they like about Woods and the Ryder Cup, but one of the reasons Woods is playing is surely to try to prove his health for Gleneagles, and find some semblance of form. Take it as read that Stricker will be like a personal captain for him.

Woods admitted he wished he had been able to play a full practice round. Then again, given where he was on Sunday evening, it seems truly amazing that he’s here at all.

Wherever you look, then, the game is certainly keeping us on the edges of our seats right now, isn’t it?

Can’t wait for 8.35am.
