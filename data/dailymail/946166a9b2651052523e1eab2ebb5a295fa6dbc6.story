A father today told how he has travelled 40,000 miles just to hug his severely autistic son, who is cared for at a specialist centre 250 miles from home.

When Josh Wills was diagnosed with severe autism, his parent's lives changed forever.

Born in October 2000, the now 13-year-old was healthy and appeared to walk, talk and develop as any other toddler.

But when he reached two-and-a-half, his parents Sarah Medley and Phill Wills started to notice something wasn't quite right.

Josh stopped speaking, he started to show signs of repetitive behaviour, began to bang his head against walls and started screaming.

Josh Wills, 13, was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two-and-a-half. For years his parents cared for him at their homes, but when his self-harming became more extreme he was referred to a specialist treatment centre in Birmingham, 250 miles from his Cornwall home

Sarah Medley and Phill Wills have travelled the 500-mile round trip to see their son for the last 20 months, but are now desperate to bring him home

Today the teenager is receiving the specialist care he needs. But it means he is separated from his parents by 250 miles, living at a treatment centre in Birmingham while his family live in Cornwall.

The couple, who have separated, told This Morning they take it in turns to make the 500-mile round trip to visit Josh as often as they can. On a good day the journey takes between five and six hours.

In the last 20 months his father said he has travelled around 40,000 miles just to hug his son.

Mr Wills said:'We haven't tucked him in bed for 19 months now, or kissed him goodnight or read him a story.

In a heartbreaking post on the family's petition page to bring him home, he wrote: 'Josh has now spent both his 12th and his 13th birthdays in the unit, 260 miles away from me and the rest of his family in Cornwall.  He has never met his little sister.

'This whole experience is heartbreaking for our family.  Josh continually asks for us and when he can’t see us he becomes anxious and more likely to self injure.

'[His] self-harming is so severe that it is life threatening. Last year he bit his tongue so badly that a third of it then had to be removed.

'We visit Josh every weekend. This is exhausting but it still never feels enough.  While the staff caring for Josh do a great job, what we can’t understand is why Josh can’t receive that same level of care, closer to home, so we don’t have to travel for over five hours just to give him a hug.'

It was when Ms Medley was at an autism awareness day that a light blub went off in her head, her son was autistic.

Shortly after that, Josh was formally diagnosed with severe autism.

His condition was a regressive form of the disorder, which comes on as a child grows up.

Ms Medley said: 'He developed fine, but he started to decline, his autism is regressive.

Josh's parents have pleaded with their local NHS authority in Cornwall to bring their son home after travelling backwards and forwards to Birmingham for nearly two years

'His speech stopped and we started to see lots of repetitive behaviour, lots of head banging. There was screaming.

'I wasn't overly concerned until I went to an autism awareness day and a light bulb went off in my head, he's got autism.

'He was diagnosed quickly because he showed all the typical traits. It was quite obvious.

'The
 quick diagnosis did help me accept it quicker, you don't want to label 
your child but because the support and research was there I could do 
what I could to help him.'

But for Josh's father Phill Wills the diagnosis was harder to come to terms with.

He said: 'I was a typical man about it, I put my head in the sand,  I thought " my boy? What?".

'But I don't think it took me that long to get my head around it.'

NHS Kernow told This Morning: 'We understand how upsetting this is for Josh and his family.

'Josh
 is the only child with autism or a learning disability that NHS Kernow 
has placed out of the county, one of the lowest rates in the country.

'We
 will always try to commission bespoke care, but Josh's complex needs 
means he does need specialist care that we are currently unable to 
provide in Cornwall.

'We
 have appointed a learning disabilities nurse to work with the family 
and our plan is to bring Josh back to Cornwall as soon as we can to find
 a way to provide him the best possible care closer to home.'

The pair said they went through a 'grieving process' for the 'boy they lost'.

Ms Medley said: 'Everyone who has a child hopes they will become a footballer, or be good at this or that.

'But those hopes and dreams die a little bit.

'You worry about if they will ever be independent, what if something happens to me? Who will care for them?

'I think that is the biggest worry for a parent, who has a child with a disability, what happens if you go?'

Ms Medley added: 'It is something you never expect. But we got through the rough times, there were periods of self-harm that were quite extreme.

'We Helped Josh feel secure and safe and the phase would pass until the next time.

'As he got older it became more apparent it was increasing, his self-harm was getting more extreme and it was becoming harder to keep him safe.

'When you have other children to look after as well it only takes turning away for a second and if he was in a bad place his head would be on the wall.

'The hardest thing was knowing that perhaps there was going to come a point where we could not keep him safe anymore and he needed more than we could give him.'

Mr Wills said: 'The specific services that Josh needs were not in place in Cornwall. He was in hospital in Truro for three months then he was transferrred to Birmingham.

'Initially we were told for 12 weeks, then it became six months.

'Now here we are 20 months later. We kept asking for help, kept asking them to look into what's missing in Cornwall, what can be put in place that can bring Josh back to us? To both our families.'

Ms Medley added: 'We always assumed he would come back, we didn't really agree with him going away in the first place but we sort of had little choice, no one was coping even the staff working with Josh.

The pair, who have separated since their son was diagnosed with severe autism, estimated they have travelled 80,000 miles between them. Mr Wills said for the last 19 months they have not been able to kiss Josh goodnight, adding the 12-year-old has not met his younger sister Marnie

The couple have worked alongside the charity Mencap
 and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, to lobby the Government to 
ensure people with a learning disability can get the support they need 
in their local communities.

They launched a petition #bringJoshhome which has more than 175,000 signatures.

In a joint statement, Jan Tregelles, chief executive of Mencap, and Vivien Cooper, chief executive of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, said: 'Josh’s story is devastating, but sadly he is not alone.

'We know that 185 children and young people are also in similar situations, stuck in assessment and treatment units hundreds of miles away from their loved ones.

'We urgently need local care services which are fit for purpose.

'The government has said that children and adults with a learning disability should not be living in units and that local areas must develop the right support and services. But this is not happening.

'This awful situation for Josh cannot be allowed to continue. 

'The money spent on sending people like Josh to units can be spent developing local services instead.

'We urge everyone to sign Josh’s petition and make this change happen.”

'But I never dreamed he would still be away now. Sarah sometimes reads him a story over the phone but it is things like that.'

Ms Medley added: 'I live in fear every time the phone rings, that something has happened and I can't get there.

'I think he is pretty traumatised, I'm worried he will never get over this emotionally. He won't get over it physically, the damage (from self-harm) is to great to his face and mouth.

'I think he needs the security of his family, he is very frightened and confused.'

When he was younger Josh suffered separation anxiety.

His parents said the now teenager would purposely hurt himself or vomit at school knowing he would be picked up and taken home.

She added: 'He is very complex. We are not saying that because he is away that is the sole reason  he is harming.

'We are very, very happy with the care he is getting, they adore him'

Josh's father added: 'It is not easy to leave him behind on a Sunday and come back to Cornwall but when he is snuggled into a specific carer, he has chosen to sit with, I take that image with me when I go home.

'He is happy, they are part of his family, they know him.'

NHS Kernow said the plan is to bring Josh closer to home for treatment and said they have employed a specialist nurse to liaise with the family.

Mr Wills added: 'It does now seem that it is a case of not if, but when Josh will come home.'
