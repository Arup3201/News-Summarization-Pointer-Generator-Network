Labour MP Jim Dobbin died suddenly on a Parliamentary visit to Poland

The by-election sparked by the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin is likely to be held on October 9.

A writ setting the date for the contest in the Heywood and Middleton constituency in Greater Manchester is to be moved by the party in the Commons today, a source said yesterday.

It is the same day as voters go to the polls in Clacton, Essex, following Douglas Carswell’s defection to Ukip from the Conservatives.

Mr Dobbin, who had represented the seat since 1997, died at the weekend at the age of 73 while on a Parliamentary trip to Poland.

At the 2010 general election, he won the seat with a majority of 5,971 over the Tory candidate. 

Mr Dobbin was in the country with other MPs as part of a Council of Europe human rights trip when he died suddenly.

His wife Pat, who he married fifty years ago this year, is believed to have been with him at the time. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband said at the time it was a ‘sad day for Parliament,’ adding that Mr Dobbin was a ‘dedicated public servant’.

Mr Miliband said: 'Jim's death is a sad day for parliament. He was a dedicated public servant, representing the people of Rochdale on the council and at Westminster for three decades. 

'Working in the NHS for more than 30 years, Jim had a deep passion for helping others.

'A lifelong committed Catholic, Jim always took a lead in fostering links between the Church and the Labour Party, and his strong faith informed every aspect of his political and public life. This was recognised by Pope Benedict XVI when he made Jim a Papal knight.

'I will miss Jim’s good friendship and decency. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Pat and, their children. We will all miss him.'

The MP was made a papal knight by Pope Benedict in 2008.

In parliament, he co-chaired a group pushing for more vaccines children in the developing world.

He voted against the same-sex marriage bill last year and spoke out against the plans in Parliament, saying: ‘I think MPs who voted for this change will rue the day they did so.’

Mr Dobbin was the local MP for Fusilier Lee Rigby, the soldier who was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, last year.

He said at the time that the death had ‘absolutely traumatised’ people in Fusilier Rigby's home town of Middleton, Greater Manchester.

Mr Dobbin, the son of a coal miner, was born in Kincardine, in Fife.

He went to Napier College, Edinburgh, where he studied bacteriology and virology, before working as a microbiologist for 33 years, 22 of which were for the Royal Oldham Hospital.

Former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott and the party's leader Ed Miliband today paid tribute to Mr Dobbin

Lord Prescott said: ‘Jim was an excellent local MP, a strong believer in Europe, a proud Scot and a passionate defender of the NHS.

‘His passing is such a tragic loss and he will be sadly missed by the Labour movement. Jim was a great comrade.’

Commons Speaker John Bercow said: ‘He was a deeply principled and independent-minded parliamentarian; respected and well-liked by his colleagues, he will be greatly missed.’

Ivan Lewis, Labour MP for Bury South, tweeted: ‘Jim Dobbin was a man of great integrity and decency. Sometimes didn't agree but always respected his sincerity.’

Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell tweeted: ‘Really sorry to hear of the sudden death of Jim Dobbin MP. I only saw him on Friday voting against bedroom tax. He was a great MP.’

Simon Danczuk wrote: ‘Shockled and Saddened to hear Jim Dobbin MP has died. My condolences go out to his wife Pat & their children. He will be sorely missed.’

Fellow Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds wrote: ‘Absolutely stunned by the news about Jim. I spoke to him just before he left for Poland. An incredibly committed MP and a good man.’

Philip Davies added: ‘So so sorry to learn of the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin. One of the nicest, most honourable and decent MPs - he will be greatly missed.’

Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said: ‘Very sad to hear of my friend and Council of Europe colleague Jim Dobbins sudden death. A wise and warm man indeed.’
