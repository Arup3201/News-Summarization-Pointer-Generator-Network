The iconic British MGB sports car that brought affordable sports car motoring to the masses is to be reborn in the 21st century – designed by Britons but built in China.

The new MG Icon was unveiled as one of the undoubted stars of the Beijing Motor Show and is a modern take on a much loved classic which is still seen widely on the road today.

It was unveiled by the MG company which is now part of the giant Shanghai Automotive industry Corporation (SAIC) which also owns Rover following the collapse of MG Rover under the controversial stewardship of the ‘Phoenix Four’ led by John Towers.

The modern-day take on the classic British sports car is expected to be launched in 2014

Its British design team said they had taken cues from the original MGB to create a modern take on the sports car. Although the show model is a coupe, a soft-top roadster is also set to follow.

But the Chinese love of British sports cars carried through to the MG stand itself which proudly bore the company badge.

Alongside mini-skirted Chinese girls were references to ‘Morris Garage’ from which the letters are said to derive, pictures of the company’s founder Cecil Kimber and a giant map of the United Kingdom painted as a patriotic Union Flag in red white and blue.

There were even photographs of Spitfires on the walls.

Insiders say the car is likely to go on 
sale around 2014 at a price of around £16,000. Although it will be 
manufactured in China, it is possible that some could be sent to the UK 
in kit form for final assembly at MG’s Longbridge factory in 
Birmingham.

The MG Icon project’s chief designer, Birmingham born Steve Harper, 53,  who started as an Austin Rover apprentice and also worked on the MG Metro and MGF sports car during his 35 year career, said: ’MG in China is seen as a young person’s brand. It’s also a global brand.

'We didn’t want to create a retro car. But we wanted to show how the MGB would have developed had its production not been ended in 1980. It’s sporty, small but practical.

'There are two seats in the back if you need to take the kids. We’re showing a coupe. But why not a roadster?’

And Anthony Williams-Kenny, 37, who is global director of design for all of the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) said: ’We set out to create a modern car, not a retro car.

Southampton-born father of two Mr Williams-Kenny, who studied automotive design at Coventry University and worked himself for seven years for the MG Rover group at Longbridge, added: ’Since we took the covers off we’ve had so many people from around the world come up to us and say "we used to have an MGB". It’s struck a chord', he said.

The original MGB  was launched as a soft-top roadster in 1962, with a fixed-head coupe following three years later in 1965.

It was built until October 1980 at MG’s factory at Abingdon in under the umbrella of MG,  the British Motor Corporation and its successors, British Motor Holdings and British Leyland Motor Corporation. More than half a million were built altogether over the 18 year lifespan, of which more than 125,000 are the hard-topped MGB GT coupes.

Work on a successor for the MGB had been undertaken as long ago as 1968, but British Leyland had pulled the plug on that project by the end of 1970.

When the Abingdon factory finally closed in the autumn of 1980, British Leyland did not replace it. But second hand versions of both the GT and Roaster versions of the MGB continue to provide affordable sporty motoring for many and sell for between £1,500 and more than £9,000 depending on condition.

MG cars were the creation of Cecil 
Kimber, general manager of Morris Garages in Oxford, who, in 1923, 
fitted special sports bodies onto standard Morris chassis.

After
years as part of British Leyland and its many incarnations, it has 
undergone a tumultuous few years - having been sold to Germany's BMW; 
who then offloaded it with the blessing of the last Labour Government' 
to the infamous  'Phoenix Four' directors led by John Towers, before it 
went bust, sparking a major scandal inquiry.

It was then snapped up for a song by the 
Chinese and is now owned by the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation
(SAIC)  which also owns Rover, which it has renamed ‘Roewe’  for the 
Chinese market, and runs the MG factory at  Longbridge in Birmingham 
which assembles some cars such as the MG6  from kits supplied from 
China.

MG and Rover were bought for just £10 after BMW, which bought it in 1994, decided to off-load the loss-making company in 2000 following six years of controversy and  rising costs and after a  potential sale to venture capital company Alchemy - opposed by unions and many Labour MPs - fell through.

Ministers were pleased by the rival Phoenix consortium deal because it kept Rover alive in the run up to he 2001 General Election at a time when its failure would have been acutely damaging in key West Midland marginal seats.

When the firm finally went bust with a loss of 6,300 jobs in April 2005 just before that year's General Election - and with dozens of marginal seats at risk - the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown rushed to Birmingham to appear hands-on during the crisis which saw the Chinese picking up the company for a song from the receivers.

MG was initially bought from the administrators in 2005 by Nanjing Automotive Company (NAC) which in turn was taken over by Shanghai Automotive in a merger 'encouraged' by the Chinese Government.

The Phoenix directors made around £40million from their stewardship of the car firm  but have always denied charges of 'asset-stripping'. But one senior BMW boss described the 'Phoenix Four' directors as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'.

The Longbridge  factory sprang back to life under Chinese ownership in August 2008 to re-start production of a two-seater MG sports car, the two-seater MG TF LE500 sports car.
