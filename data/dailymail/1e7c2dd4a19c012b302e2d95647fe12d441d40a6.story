Balanced dangerously on two glass bottles and performing push-ups, nine-year-old Giuliano Stroe shows off his remarkable strength

But the latest stunt by the 'world's strongest boy' has sparked outrage, with critics claiming his father is putting his son at risk of serious injury.

Giuliano and his seven-year-old brother Claudiu first hit the headlines when videos showing their intense training regime went viral in 2010.

The tiny muscle 'men' have been performing amazing acrobatic feats and lifting weights since they were toddlers.

Handstand: The nine-year-old elevates and extends fully in an eye-catching display. His parents have denied forcing him to train for hours and mother Ileana said of her sons: 'They have a natural ability for this, nothing is forced, it is what God intended for them'

But the shocking latest photos - posted by their dad Iulian - showing Giuliano balancing on two bottles using only his hands have been criticised as extremely dangerous.

The youngster is precariously balanced, and the pictures show that he could easily slip on the bottles which could smash and cause massive injury to his hands and face when he came crashing down.

One user wrote: 'And what if the bottle cracks? What chance is there that he wouldn't get a serious injury on the way down?'

A Facebook user called Paul Moktan wrote, 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks', while another user called Victor Hammer wrote: 'You are destroying his body! Please, it's not OK for the kid.' 

On previous videos posted by the father, other uses have accused him of 'child abuse' 

But the criticism has been ignored by the family, and it is not the first time that the boy has been shown doing risky exercises.

In a video posted recently, Giuliano is seen performing 25 push-ups on his hands on a horizontal bar and with his head down.

His younger brother Claudio does the same exercise, but only manages to make 12 push-ups.

Balance: The youngster is capable of extreme shows of strength and performs push ups while balanced on two glass bottles, which prompted criticism on social media

Dangerous: Giuliano performs push ups on the bottles, causing one social media user to comment: 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks'

Giuliano has already broken two world records for 90-degree vertical push-ups and another for holding on to a pole like a human flag.

Claudiu soon followed suit, starting at the age of 18 months, and is already performing handstand push-ups on a bar and learning the same terrifying flag trick.

Father Iulian, 38, was determined to make them famous and put them through a gruelling two hour regime each morning in Florence, in central Italy, where his family lived.

His plans went awry and he was forced back to Romania, where he has now makes a living selling scrap metal and trading in the southern village of Icoana.

But he has continued the rigorous training regime, promoting it on the boy's Facebook page which now has more than 3.6 million likes.

Dedication: Iulian has trained his sons in their home gyms since an early age, and is capable of lifting heavy weights that many adults would struggle with

Although local authorities have protested against the father's attitude, they have so far failed to sanction him because they cannot prove he is harming the children.

The boys are clearly capable of extraordinary feats, but it has been suggested that it is cruel to expect children of their age to train so hard.

But both Iulian and his wife Ileana, 33, defend their training regime for their boy and Ileana said: 'They have a natural ability for this, nothing is forced, it is what God intended for them.'
