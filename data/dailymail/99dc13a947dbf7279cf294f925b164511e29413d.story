French coach Loic Courteau confirmed on Tuesday that he has been in talks to join Andy Murray's support team.

The 50-year-old Frenchman is seen as having the credentials to add experience to Murray's staff after the departures this year of Ivan Lendl and Dani Vallverdu.

As reported by Sportsmail, he has already talked about the matter with Amelie Mauresmo, who he is close to after helping guide her to world No 1 in her own illustrious career.

'A few weeks ago I had some discussions with Amelie, who had talked about it with Andy', Courteau told French newspaper L'Equipe. 'It would definitely be a super interesting challenge to coach Murray and in addition with Amelie would be fabulous.'

However, Courteau currently works with world No 25 and French Davis Cup player Julien Benneteau, who he has nurtured to an Indian summer in his career.

At 33 he is approaching the twilight of his days as a singles performer, which would make the Murray option more attractive.

'I have spoken to Julien about this. At the Australian Open I will be with him. With his experience he could work on his own,' said Courteau, who has been with him for five years.Â 

Murray started working with Frenchwoman Mauresmo ahead of Wimbledon in June 2014

Murray, who is currently finishing off a winter training stint in Miami, began working with Mauresmo in June and believes their arrangement will bear more fruit in 2015.

His support team is currently looking somewhat depleted after Vallverdu quit to join Tomas Berdych and experienced trainer Jez Green also left.

The Scot kicks off the new season next week with an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and then will represent Great Britain in the Hopman Cup in Perth ahead of the Australian Open.
