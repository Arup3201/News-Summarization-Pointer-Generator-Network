A reconstruction of the moments leading up to Madeleine McCann's disappearance is to be aired tonight in a renewed bid to find her six years after she went missing.

A full re-enactment lasting 25 minutes will be  shown during the special episode of BBC Crimewatch, including a game of tennis she played with her parents.

Pictures of men seen in and around the Portuguese town of Praia da Luz on the night of Maddie's disappearance on May 3, 2007, will also be shown as part of a new appeal to find the girl.

Nightmare: The reconstruction of the events leading up to Madeleine McCann's disappearance includes a reenactment of a game of tennis she played with her parents

Video: A short clip has been released ahead of the broadcast showing a reconstructed scene of Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry playing tennis. The girl is circled

A number of e-fits, including two of 
German-speaking men, have been released by British detectivesÂ  in an 
effort to identify potential suspects and eliminate innocent sightings. Other e-fits have been released in the past to no avail.

Their daughter, dressed in pink shorts, a light pink T-shirt and pink hat, will be seen running across the court, clutching a batch of tennis balls just days before she vanished from the Algarve.

An interview with the McCanns will also be shown, where they were asked how often they think of their daughter, who went missing when she was three years old on May 3 2007.

Her parents were dining at a nearby tapas restaurant when she disappeared from their holiday apartment.

Mr McCann says: 'When it's a special occasion, when you should be your happiest and Madeleine's not there, that's when it really hits home.

Disappeared: A bed similar to the one Madeline was last seen in will be shown

Abduction: The moment Madeline was abducted has also been recreated in a renewed bid to find her five years after she went missing

'Obviously, Madeleine's birthday goes without saying.'

Mrs McCann adds: 'It's when you have big family occasions really. That's it isn't it? 'Family occasion' and you haven't got your complete family."

Crimewatch presenter Kirsty Young will speak to the McCanns live in the studio during the programme, while presenter Matthew Amroliwala explores the new focus of the police investigation in the resort where she disappeared.

Senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, will also discuss how the police have approached the inquiry.

He says: 'Primarily what we sought to do from the beginning is to try and draw everything back to zero if you like.

'Try and take everything back to the beginning and re-analyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing.'

Parents: An interview with Kate and Gerry McCann will also feature in the special episode of BBC Crimewatch

Abducted: The image of Madeline before she disappeared which became synonymous with efforts to find her

He adds: 'The careful and critical analysis of the timeline has been absolutely key.

'Primarily, we're focused on the area between 8.30 and 10.

'We know at 8.30 that was the time Mr and Mrs McCann went down to the tapas area for their dinner and we know that around at 10pm that was when Mrs McCann found that Madeleine was missing."

An incident room will be staffed during tomorrow's appeal and the days that follow, when the appeal moves to Holland and Germany, where dedicated TV programmes will also be shown.

A dedicated call centre will also be opened at Hendon, in north-west London.

Mr Redwood and his team recently revealed a vast log of mobile phone traffic could be the key to finding out what happened to Madeleine.

Scotland Yard detectives have interviewed 442 people as part of their review-turned-investigation and hope to track down as many people present in the Portuguese town at the time.

Since launching its own investigation, 41 people of interest have been identified by the Metropolitan Police, including 15 UK nationals.

Review: DCI Andy Redwood will say the careful and critical analysis of the timeline has been absolutely key to the new investigation

Detectives have issued 31 international letters of request (ILOR) to mostly European countries in relation to the persons of interest as well as seeking permission to access phone records.

A large but 'manageable' list of phone numbers identified as being present in Praia da Luz has been drawn up by detectives with a 'significant' number unattributed to any named person.

Ahead of the programme, Mr Redwood, said: 'The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance.

'Our work to date has significantly changed the timeline and the accepted version of events that has been in the public domain to date.

'It has allowed us to work with Crimewatch to build the most detailed reconstruction as yet, and highlight very specific appeal points.

'I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together within the overall context of that appeal, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.'

The Portuguese investigation officially closed but authorities there are backing the Scotland Yard inquiry and officers from both countries will work together in pursuing new leads.

The Metropolitan Police now has a team of six Portuguese detectives based in Faro, who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf.

The McCanns are currently suing former police chief Goncalo Amaral for libel over claims in the book The Truth Of The Lie.
