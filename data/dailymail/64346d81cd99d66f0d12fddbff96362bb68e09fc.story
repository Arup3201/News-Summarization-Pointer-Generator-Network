A Lidl worker who was bullied out of his job after complaining about mouldy food on the shelves is set to receive more than £10,000.

Matthew O’Donnell, 28, alerted managers after he spotted defrosted and ‘degenerated’ items on sale.

He claimed the stock had been compromised after the fridges and freezers were turned off for more than four hours for maintenance during a heatwave.

Matthew O'Donnell is set to receive thousands after a tribunal judge ruled he had been unfairly treated after reporting mouldy and defrosted food at Lidl in Hanham, Bristol

The chilled and frozen items were still on sale the next day at the store in Bristol, and Mr O’Donnell said customers were specifically directed towards them to ‘maximise consumption’. 

At work that day, he claimed he also spotted mouldy produce in the fruit and vegetable section.

But when he complained, he was subjected to ‘a campaign of victimisation and harassment’ and forced to resign from his job. Mr O’Donnell took the company to an employment tribunal where a judge ruled he had suffered detriment or dismissal for exercising his rights.

Yesterday, Mr O’Donnell hailed his win as a victory for the public and said he hoped it would encourage other whistleblowers to speak out.

Mr O'Donell will receive damages of more than £10,000 to cover the loss of his job 

He will receive damages of more than £10,000 to cover the loss of his job and the bullying he faced.

He is also claiming for anxiety and depression, after representing himself against a top London lawyer in proceedings which dragged on for almost a year.

The tribunal in Bristol heard Mr O’Donnell began working at the city’s Hanham store on June 8 last year. He described how, during a night shift on July 7, a contractor began upgrading the shop’s electrics and the power was switched off for more than four hours.

When he went to work the next day he found products ‘seriously degenerated’ four days prior to their use-by date, and mould in the fruit and vegetable section.

Mr O’Donnell sent a report to senior managers, believing he would be protected under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. He told bosses he felt he would be responsible if anything happened to customers.

But Mr O’Donnell, from Kingswood, Bristol, said his initial complaints were dismissed by store manager Krzysztof Golanski, who threatened him about his job. He was warned not to ‘embarrass’ the store, soon finding himself taken off certain shifts.

The situation became so bad he felt forced to hand in his notice on September 9. Judge Michael Ford QC ruled that he lost his job because he spoke out.

The judge added: ‘The claimant, we consider, made an entirely proper and legitimate disclosure about a serious threat to health and safety.’

Lidl spokesman Georgina O’Donnell said: ‘We accept the decision of the tribunal and we will remain vigilant to ensure that the appropriate processes are duly followed in future.’

A spokesman for Lidl said it accepted the tribunal's decision and will work to 'ensure the appropriate processes are duly followed in future'
