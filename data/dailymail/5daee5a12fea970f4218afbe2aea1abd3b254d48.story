The home nations managers will take part in a live Google hangout before September's European Championships qualifiers.

England manager, Roy Hodgson, Northern Ireland’s Michael O’Neill, Scotland’s Gordon Strachan and Wales’s Chris Coleman, will answer questions from fans across each of the nations.

England face Switzerland in their first group game on Monday 8th September. Northern Ireland and Scotland both kick off their hunt for qualification on Sunday 7th September with Michael O’Neill’s men away in Hungary and Scotland given the task of facing World Cup Champions Germany. 

Wales face Andorra away with all four teams hopeful of qualification and a place in the UEFA European Championship Finals in France 2016.

Qualifiers: Roy Hodgson will face Switzerland in England's first European Championships qualifier next month

Pundit: Gordon Strachan will hope he's in the dugout rather than studio for the next international tournament

First: Northern Ireland have never played in the European Championships finals, O'Neill is looking to change that

History: Wales haven't made it to the European Championships finals since 1976
