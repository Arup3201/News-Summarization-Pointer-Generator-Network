The body of a British woman who went missing while travelling on a yacht off the coast of Mexico has been found, according to state prosecutors.

The Foreign Office confirmed one Briton had died after a search operation was launched earlier this week for couple Paul Whitehouse and Simone Wood in the aftermath of Hurricane Odile.

The pair, from London and Wolverhampton, are thought to have been living on their yacht in La Paz for a year. Mr Whitehouse is still missing, it has been reported this morning.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national, reported missing along with another British national earlier this week off the coast of Mexico.

'The Embassy is working with the local authorities and consular staff are providing assistance to both families at this very difficult time.'

Hurricane Odile left a trail of destruction when it hit the Baja California Peninsula last Sunday.

Three other people have been confirmed dead following the storm - two Korean citizens and a German man who reportedly died from a heart attack.

Mexican authorities have deployed more than 8,000 army, navy and federal police personnel to prevent looting in the area.

Simon Barlow, a friend of Mr Whitehouse, said those close to him are 'massively worried, really concerned with the situation over in Mexico'.

Mr Barlow told Channel 4 News yesterday: 'We are all hoping that they are going to be found and it's just communications that's not letting us find that information out.

'We're waiting and anticipating, you just can't put it into words, you just can't go over there to help.

'I'm hoping that his background of being in the Army has hopefully served a purpose and they're both fine.'

The couple, in their 40s, were believed to be living on their yacht in the harbour of La Paz when it capsized along with 24 other vessels during violent 125mph winds.

It is thought that the pair had been living on the 70-foot boat for the last year as Mr Whitehouse worked as a scuba diving instructor in La Paz.

The category three hurricane destroyed homes and hotels in beach resorts across the Baja California peninsula while also damaging power and water supplies and phone services - triggering widespread looting.Â
