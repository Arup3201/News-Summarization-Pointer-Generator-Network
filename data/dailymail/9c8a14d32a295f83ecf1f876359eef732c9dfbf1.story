Oneida Indian Nation members yesterday called on the National Football League to use its authority to force the Washington Redskins football team to change its controversial name.

Representatives from the Oneida Nation met in New York City on Wednesday with the NFL and Washington Redskins officials.

But, seemingly like their counterparts in Washington's Congress, the three parties could not come to any agreement on the issue of the football team's name.

Oneida Indian Nation representative Ray Halbritter called on the NFL to force the Washington Redskins to change its controversial name. The Oneida claim there should be an NFL bylaw prohibiting any term using a racial epithet. Halbritter said the dictionary defines the word "redskins" precisely like that

The roadblock is caused by Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder's refusal to change the name, Oneida's refusal to back down from their claim the name is offensive, and the NFL's apparent refusal to take a stand on the issue.

'We requested that the commissioner use his authority to refer Daniel Snyder to the league for possible sanction over the continued use of the term,' said Oneida representative Ray Halbritter, referring to the Redskins owner, according to ABC News. 'If the commissioner lacks the power to act, he should publicly say so.'

'Despite ridiculous assertions to the contrary, the use of the R-word is not a unifying force nor does it convey respect. It is the very word our people heard when they were dragged by gunpoint off their land and dragged onto reservations,' Halbritter said.

The NFL said the meeting was part of an 'on-going dialogue' on the issue.

'We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter, Oneida Nation Wolf Clan Representative Keller George and their colleagues as well as the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general,' a statement from the NFL said.

'The meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue to facilitate listening and learning, consistent with the commissioner's comments earlier this year.'

Redskins owner Daniel Snyder met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday but did not discuss plans to change the name, according to reports of the meeting.

Snyder remains firm that the name will not be changed, recently writing a letter to team fans that claimed the name 'was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.'

'I’ve listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides, and I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name,' Snyder wrote.

'But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too.'

Oneida nation representatives called for Goodell, Snyder, and other top NFL executives to again meet during the week of the Superbowl in 2014 and to visit Indian reservations to see first-hand how the term 'Redskins' affects Oneida Nation members.

'We will not be silent on this issue and it's not going to go away, not this time,' Halbritter said. 'This strikes at the heart of the issue of what kind of future our children will have.'

Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, pictured, claims he has no plans to change the Redskins name. The team was founded as the Boston Braves in 1932 before renaming in 1933 after a name clash with a baseball team with the same name. The team moved to Washington, DC, in 1937

The controversy has spread to how some media organizations now refer to the NFL team.

The San Francisco Chronicle is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term 'Redskins' when it refers to Washington's National Football League team.

Managing Editor Audrey Cooper announced on Wednesday that the newspaper's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial slurs.

The use of the Redskins name is being contested in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to block its use.

Suzan Shown Harjo, an Indian rights activist, said claims the Redskins name was part of the team's heritage was flawed.

'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.'

The Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Braves in 1932, their inaugural year. They played in Fenway Park in Boston, also home at the time to baseball teams the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves) and current World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox.

To avoid confusion with the baseball Braves, the football team changed its name to the Redskins the following year.

The team moved to Washington in 1937.
