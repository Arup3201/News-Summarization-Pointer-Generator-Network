Ghostly creatures come to life in otherworldly light paintings in a collection of pictures by a Finnish art teacher.

The pictures were made with LED lights by Janne Parviainen, 34, from Helsinki, Finland.

The blue and green bodies appear to exist in another dimension as they walk through the human world.

Janne Parviainen from Helsinki, Finland, takes up to 20 hours to create each light painting in his studio or at local landmarks

Each painting can take up to 20 hours to complete in Janne's studio or at Finnish landmarks.

First, he draws with white paint on his black studio walls to create the base of the painting.

Then using a long exposure, Janne uses his coloured LED lights to create the bizarre human shapes.

Janne said: 'The most time consuming part of this is to calculate the perspective right since I don't use any projectors or such as a help.'

Janne continued: 'I think it pays off to use your own brains instead of machines.

'The light painting is executed when the studio is completely dark so I can light the correct parts of the drawings in the desired effect and to draw the characters with LED light while the camera is on long exposure.

'As you can imagine, working in pitch black conditions and drawing in the air can be a bit hard so I usually need quite a lot of takes before I'm happy with the result.'

Most of Janne's paintings take place in near or total darkness, which means he has to do several attempts before he is pleased with the result

Janne's antics in the centre of Helsinki attract a lot of attention.

He said: 'I decided to create a spontaneous guerrilla light art piece and finally found a spot right in the centre of Helsinki and started drawing the figures on the asphalt with chalk sticks.

'I gathered quite a crowd on the set when I started light painting the upper parts of the figures since I had to sit on the ground on top of the chalk drawings and trace my body with a flashlight.

'I can imagine it looked quite a performance.' 

Janne's antics in the centre of Helsinki attract a lot of attention - for this picture he had to sit on the ground on top of the chalk drawings and trace his body with a flashlight.
