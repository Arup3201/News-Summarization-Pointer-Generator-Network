House proud: Kirstie Allsopp said the Swedish home store is good at what it does but hampers traditions

Ikea is creating a ‘throwaway culture’ that has destroyed the art of homemaking, according to Kirstie Allsopp.

The 42-year-old TV presenter said families no longer passed down furniture to the next generation and instead were too quick to dispose of household items.

‘I have nothing against IKEA but ultimately it encourages this buy and throwaway culture which we live in,’ she said. ‘It also encourages people to have homes which all look the same’.

Miss Allsopp hosts Location, Location, Location, in which she scours the country in search of the perfect home for buyers. She said Ikea was ‘very good at what it does’, but had helped kill the tradition of passing on furniture.

‘At one time people would get married or move in together and a member of family would give you an item or a piece of furniture to start your home,’ she said.

‘It was never a case of we will buy all new, and it is a shame.

‘The great thing about handing things down is the history and the story behind objects.

‘I would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need.

‘They have been brought up to appreciate great furniture so I hope they would never shop there.’

She said there is ‘something wonderful’ about unearthing furniture in antique stores, second hand shops or at auction.

Miss Allsopp, has two sons – Bay, seven, and Oscar, five – with her partner, property developer Ben Andersen, 51. They also share custody of his sons from his previous marriage, Orion and Hal.

The family live in London during the week and spend weekends at a rural retreat in north Devon.

Speaking to promote B&Q’s Textile Trade In, in which shoppers can donate unwanted cushions and curtains that will be passed on to the British Heart Foundation, she also confessed to having obsessive tendencies on all matters home-related.

‘I’m very particular about where I have cushions in my home and how plumped they are,’ she said. ‘With the cushions, my partner and the kids are allowed to touch them but I like to encourage otherwise.

‘With the sofa, I will sometimes get an idea of where I want it in the middle of the night and you will find me moving it around.

‘I think my OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] ways are challenged by toys – I want to keep them all in boxes in a particular corner. However I have accepted over time that it isn’t going to work that way.

‘My wardrobe is coded in terms of styles, I have certain styles of dresses which have to hang together. So if I have the same dress in a variety of colours they all hang together.

‘I also have a thing about straightening picture frames. Always straightening picture frames.

‘I suppose I am just extremely house proud.’

IKEA first opened in 1958 in Sweden and has become popular in Britain with its affordable, self-assembly furniture.

The Location Location Location presenter said: 'I would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need.' She raised them to 'appreciate furniture'

Miss Allsopp has written two books – Kirstie’s Homemade Home and Kirstie Allsopp Craft – on how to create furniture and fabrics for your home.

Her advice on interiors ranges from how to make a canopy for your bed out of a wedding veil, to how to make a memory box out of an unused cabinet.

In her interview she said she would give up her work ‘in a heartbeat’ for the sake of being a mother. ‘My home will always be more important than my role on the television,’ she said.

‘I have a team of five people around me helping me ensure I fulfil that role at home.

‘If I had to give it all up because my children missed out on their mum I would because they are more important to me. I am incredibly lucky that I don’t have to work, I choose to.’
