Jenna Bush has confirmed that her first kiss with husband Henry Hager took place on the White House roof and insists that the memorable moment was much more innocent than the world wants it to be.

Speaking to the Today show earlier this morning, the 33-year-old mother-of-one took the opportunity to clarify exactly what she meant when she told TV host Andy Cohen that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the roof when she was younger.

'OK, first I have to say I was shocked by the question,' she told the Today team. 'But my husband and I did have our first kiss on the White House roof. Is that embarrassing?'

Confession: Former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager, now 33 and married to Henry Hager, has admitted that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the White House roof when she was 19

Playing innocent: At first, Jenna remained coy when she was asked if she had ever fooled around in the White House, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!'

Jenna, who is the daughter of former US President George W. Bush and his wife, former First Lady Laura Bush, went on to add that the kiss was 'pretty innocent' but that both she and her husband Henry hold the memory very dear. 

'I want to say two things,' she said during the phone interview. 'First of all, it is not the Fifty Shades of Grey thing that people want it to be. It was pretty innocent but really lovely and now, you know, 10 years later, here we are with a child, so it's a pretty special thing.

'And then second of all, I think I single-handedly brought back the words hanky panky.'

Eager to try and glean as much information as possible from a slightly embarrassed Jenna, Today show hosts Carson Daly and Al Roker immediately pressed for her to describe the romantic scene in a bit more detail.

'I just want to know if the snipers on the roof of the White House gave you any privacy,' Carson, 41, asked.

'Well, I mean, maybe there was no privacy,' Jenna admitted. 'There probably was no privacy, but in our minds we were the only two people there.'

All grown up: These days, she is happily married to Henry Hager, with whom she has a one-year-old daughter named Mila

What a laugh: Jenna (R) appeared on the show alongside TV chef Rachael Ray and both of the ladies spent much of the episode in hysterics

Never one to skirt around an issue, co-host Al, jumped in to ask: 'But you did cross into canoodling?' much to the shock of his fellow presenters. 

'No, there was no canoodling thank you,' Jenna said. 'There was not heavy petting, there was nothing.' 

On Wednesday night, Jenna appeared on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live, where the TV host questioned whether or not she had ever 'fooled around' in the White House.

At first, Jenna remained coy, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!'

But eventually, she confessed: 'Maybe there was a little kiss on the roof.' 

Jenna implied that the lucky man on that fateful night was her husband-to-be, explaining: 'I was 19 years old when my dad became president... meaning I knew [my husband] for a long time. 

Tell-all: Andy also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom. 'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there'

Family values: Jenna (R) is the younger of former President George Bush's twin daughters

'And you know, maybe there was a little hanky panky. There was maybe a kiss on the roof,' she revealed with a sly smile.

The Today show correspondent, who met her husband during father George W Bush's 2004 campaign, was also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom.

'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there.'

Jenna, who welcomed daughter Mila in April 2013, also talked about being 'fiercely protective' of Malia and Sasha Obama, who were recently criticized by a GOP aide for not showing enough 'class'.

'It's not easy, and it's not a job that they wanted. And so it's hard!' said Jenna.

'I mean I, obviously, heh, had a hard time. But it's also a privilege. So I mean... they've done an incredible job.'
