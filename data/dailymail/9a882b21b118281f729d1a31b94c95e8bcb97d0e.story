Egypt's Supreme Court has ordered for the country's parliament to be dissolved after ruling that its election six months ago was unconstitutional.

The country's top court said a third of the Islamist-dominated legislature was elected illegally and new elections will have to be held.

In it's ruling, the court said that 'the makeup of the entire chamber is illegal and, consequently, it does not legally stand.'

The explanation was carried by Egypt's official news agency and confirmed to The Associated Press by one of the court's judges, Maher Sami Youssef.

The ruling means that new elections for the entire parliament will have to be held.

The law governing the parliamentary elections, held over a three-month period starting in November, was ruled unconstitutional by a lower court because it breached the principle of equality when it allowed party members to contest a third of seats set aside for independents.

The remaining two thirds were contested by party slates.

Hosni Mubarak's health has continued to decline since the former dictator was sentenced more than two weeks ago.

Whe was jailed for life for failing to stop the killing of hundreds of demonstrators as his regime crumbled around him during last year's Arab Spring.

Security officials said Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were by his side at the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital, south of Cairo.

Mubarak ruled Egypt for almost 30 years, but his authoritarian regime was overthrown in February last year after tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated in Cairo's Tahrir Square and elsewhere.

Demonstrators returned to the square last week after Mubarak was jailed for life but cleared of corruption.

In a separate ruling, the court said Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, could stay in the presidential race, rejecting a law passed by parliament last month that barred prominent figures from the old regime from running for office.

Shafiq will go head-to-head on Saturday and Sunday in a runoff against Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's strongest political group.

The ruling said the legislation was 
not based on 'objective grounds' and 'constitutes a violation of the 
principle of equality,' leading to discrimination on 'illogical 
grounds.'

The Brotherhood 
stands to lose the most by the rulings since it controls just under half
of all seats in the legislature and is likely not to do as well in the 
next election.

Its 
popularity has declined since the legislative election over its failure 
to translate its parliamentary domination into real political power and 
its perception as a power hungry group more preoccupied with its own 
interests than national ones.

The
legal wrangling adds to the suspense around an election that is 
supposed to seal a transition to democracy after Mubarak was toppled in 
an Arab Spring uprising last year, but has laid bare deep divisions over
how Egypt should be governed.

The
law denying political rights to Mubarak's officials had prompted a 
state election committee to disqualify Shafik from the presidential 
race, but he was let back in on appeal, pending the court ruling.

The
drama is emblematic of the tortuous and messy transition overseen by a 
council of generals since Mubarak was ousted 16 months ago.

A first-round presidential vote last 
month pushed more moderate candidates out of the race and the choice now
facing 50 million eligible voters reflects a society torn between 
desire for change after six decades of military rule and anxiety over 
the damage wrought on Egypt by the subsequent political chaos.

Unrest
has simmered on the streets of Egypt's cities throughout the period of 
military rule, with opponents of the army calling for the removal of 
'feloul', or Mubarak-era remnants, from politics. The demand is far from
unanimous.

'Shafik is a
respectable man. We want him as president because we are not ready for 
Egypt to return to the Dark Ages,' said Shafik supporter Sawsan Ali 
Abdo.

'There is no such 
thing as 'feloul'. We are all Egyptians. No to the plot seeking to 
divide Egypt,' read one banner in the capital.

Across the street, Shafik campaign posters were spray-painted red to obscure his face.
