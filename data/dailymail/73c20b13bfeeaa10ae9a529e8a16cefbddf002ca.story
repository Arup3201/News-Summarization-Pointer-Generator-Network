His eyes light up when he talks of the time England threw him into the World Cup deep end as a raw fast bowler barely out of club cricket.

‘My first World Cup in South Africa stands out,’ said James Anderson, who stepped up from Burnley CC to the big time 12 years ago. ‘It was the first time my family had seen me play for England and it meant a lot for them to be there.

‘There was also the Zimbabwe situation where we were effectively knocked out because we didn’t go there.’

England refused to travel to Harare because of safety concerns and Zimbabwe were awarded all four World Cup points. Then a two-wicket defeat by Australia, when Andy Bichel hammered Anderson, made it impossible for England to progress.

‘It was an eventful time and, even though I felt I then lost us that game against Australia in Port Elizabeth, when Nasser Hussain put faith in me, the fact he brought me on at a critical time gave me confidence that I could perform at that level.’

Then there was his first World Cup as a fan. ‘Something we should look at as a team now is the 1992 World Cup because that was in Australia and New Zealand too. I was nine. We didn’t have Sky so I went round my dad’s mate’s house to watch it in the early hours.

‘I know it’s a while ago but people still talk about it as a great World Cup for England and we know we’ll get big support in Australia. It could be an exciting time and we can draw on the history of what happened then.’ England finished runners-up in 1992, losing to Imran Khan’s Pakistan in the Melbourne final.

There is no doubting Anderson’s enthusiasm. The man who stands on the brink of his 100th Test and Sir Ian Botham’s wicket-taking record is fit, raring to go, and keen to point out that limited-overs matches mean just as much to him as the ultimate game.

‘One-day cricket is really significant for me,’ said Anderson as he prepares to go to Australia  for the triangular series that precedes the World Cup. ‘I made my England debut in one-day cricket and I’ve always enjoyed that form. I’ve still got a drive to play one-day cricket so until that stops I will carry on. My record in 50-over games is probably better than Tests if you look at the stats. It will be great to have these months of one-day cricket.’

But surely this is his last chance to make a real impact in a World Cup? The premier one-day tournament is usually a watershed. Alastair Cook has gone and it looks certain England will rip up their one-day blueprint and start again after this World Cup with younger, more dynamic players.

‘I don’t want to say this is my last World Cup,’ Anderson insisted. ‘It’s probably unlikely I’ll play in the next one because I’ll be 36 by then but it’s not impossible. I want to concentrate on this one first.’

England will need him at his best. As Nasser Hussain identified in these pages after the series defeat in Sri Lanka, England’s bowling is an even bigger one-day problem than the batting, which is often too cautious.

Anderson, who sat out Sri Lanka to provide rest for his battle-scarred body, and Stuart Broad, who returns after knee surgery, are crucial figures if England are to take World Cup wickets and restrict the big hitters.

‘We’ve identified the last 15 overs of innings as an area where we can get better,’ said Anderson. ‘I see myself bowling in that stage of a game and it’s something we’ll look at. I don’t necessarily think it needs new skills and at this stage of my career I’ve got enough up my sleeve to perform well. It’s partly execution of each delivery and you’ve got to be able to hit the right area with every ball.

‘You have to pick the right moment to bowl the right ball and stay one step ahead of the batter. With only four men outside the circle it’s crucial we get our fields right. You see people sometimes changing every ball but you have to be clinical. You have to have options rather than trying to sort it out on the field.’

England will be rank outsiders in the triangular series against Australia and India and then the World Cup. ‘Everywhere you look people have been saying we haven’t got a chance but, not only does that make you more determined, it means you can pass under the radar,’ said Anderson.

2011: Produces some brilliant bowling as England beat South Africa, but is shattered after his Ashes heroics Down Under and isn’t in the team as England are hammered by Sri Lanka in the quarter-final. 

They will attempt to exceed expectations under new leadership after Anderson’s friend Cook was replaced by Eoin Morgan. ‘I feel sorry for Cooky because he’s done so much behind the scenes and he’s got a real vision of where he wants the team to go,’ said Anderson. ‘But his form in the last 12 to 18 months hasn’t been near the standard it needs to be to stay in and he will admit that.’

Whatever happens in the World Cup, Anderson has a big date in Antigua in April, where he is due to appear in his 100th Test and can celebrate it with the four wickets he needs to exceed Botham’s tally of 383. ‘I’m not thinking about the record,’ he said. ‘One-day cricket is at the forefront of my mind. The last thing I want to be thinking is that I could get those wickets in my 100th Test in Antigua. I could get injured. I’d love to pass the record but I don’t want to tempt fate.’

And, however long Anderson has left in both Test and one-day cricket, he will not be changing the aggressive style that landed him in hot water last summer for a clash with Ravindra Jadeja at Trent Bridge. The bowler was cleared on the Level Three disciplinary charge that could have seen him banned but his penchant for sledging, which contrasts with his mild-mannered off-field demeanour, remains under scrutiny.

‘My attitude is something I’ve worked on with a psychologist over the last few years to get the best out of me as a bowler and that means being aggressive,’ said Anderson.

‘The umpires are on the field to marshal what’s going on and if they feel someone oversteps the mark they report it to the match referee. Nothing was reported in that game or the series. But it is something I’m conscious of.

‘We know there are kids watching and we have to try to find a balance between winning and being a role model. I’m well aware of it but I think the aggression is something I’ve channelled well in recent years. My career took off in 2008 and that was the start of getting it right and being consistent on the field.It’s always been part of the game.

‘As a kid playing club cricket I would be sledged by 40-year-old blokes. I saw it growing up on TV — the Aussies doing it to England. I never want to cross the line where it goes too far. I’ll continue to be aggressive but I’m very aware of the laws and spirit of the game. That aggression has helped me take wickets and I’ll try to keep channelling it in the right way.’

It is a method that has served England well and will need to do so again if they are to have any chance of upsetting the odds in Australia.
