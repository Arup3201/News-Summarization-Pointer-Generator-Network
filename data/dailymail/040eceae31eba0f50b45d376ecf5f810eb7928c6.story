A worldwide relaxation of the rules barring air passengers from using devices such as iPads, laptops and e-readers before a plane takes off came closer yesterday.

Aviation authorities in the US are to rule that travellers can keep such devices on during taxi, takeoff and landing because they are safer than had been thought.

They found such gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban was from the 1960s when such devices were very different.

Coming change: Travellers in the US will soon be able to use electronic devices during taxi, takeoff and landing after research showed they do not interfere with the navigation system

The decision will mean that on transatlantic flights, UK passengers will be 
able to use their gadgets as they land on US soil.

However, when they 
take off from Britain they will not be able to do so. The rules could 
change in Britain and across the world if the US research is shown to be
credible.

The US Federal Aviation Authority will formally unveil its findings in September, it was reported yesterday.

Mobile phones will still have to be kept off but everything else will be
approved for use even below 10,000ft, the current cutoff.

Phones are excluded because they were not part of the research, although the FAA is expected to look at this issue separately.

Overseas: The US lifting of the ban could spread to the UK if the American research is shown to be credible

The report will state that the original rules in the US were written in 
1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from 
computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation 
systems.

Nowadays passenger jets are ‘much more tolerant’ to such 
interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer.

The report says this is because they use less power, transmit weaker signals and ‘stay within a tighter range of frequencies’.

The FAA concludes that the ban has ‘become untenable’ because of the widespread use of consumer electronics.

Another factor has been the sheer number of passengers ignoring the 
rules. One survey found that, by accident or on purpose, a third of 
passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off.

The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority said that it was monitoring the situation.
