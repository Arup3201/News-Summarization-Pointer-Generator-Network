The cold-blooded murder of Colombian defender Andres Escobar after he scored an own goal against the United States in the 1994 World Cup ripped a nation's love of football to shreds.

Now, one of the biggest matches in Colombia's history – a quarter-final against hosts Brazil – is being prepared for to the backdrop of one of their most shocking moments, July 2 marking 20 years to the day that Escobar was shot in his hometown Medellin.

A country tipped by Pele to win that USA '94 World Cup following their 5-0 drubbing of Argentina in qualifying was divided by violence and drug lords but united by the wonderful game. Football and criminality were intrinsically linked.

Infamous drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar, no relation to Andres, had a fierce passion for the game.

Escobar, once considered the richest criminal in the world, invested large chunks of his billions into Colombian football and would fly global superstars to play in friendlies at his ranch.

After he handed himself into the authorities in 1991, members of the national team would visit him in the private prison he had built in negotiating his capture.

But he was killed in 1993 and was not alive to see the the events a year later which devastated the country.

Their side was considered a Golden Generation – Andres Escobar joined by Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla, René Higuita and Freddy Rincón – and had lost just once in 26 matches leading up to the tournament.

But they started the group stage with a surprise 3-1 defeat to Romania and it all began to unravel. The team received death threats and some didn't want to continue.

They played on, however, and faced the hosts next. It was perhaps a fatal decision in Escobar's case.

In the 35th minute, he stretched to cut out a John Harkes cross and sent the ball trickling into his own net. The match ended in a 2-1 defeat, which effectively sent them out of the tournament, a result met with even more disbelief than the first game.

They won their last group match against Switzerland but it was not enough to progress and Escobar returned home to Medellin.

Against the advice of friends he ventured out into the city, where he had always been treated as a star.

But when he was split from companions in a nightclub and returned to his car, he was shot six times in the back.

Escobar had made plans to marry fiancée Pamela Cascardo and they were due to start a family. It is also thought he was set to sign a contract at AC Milan and move to Italy. Many thought he would go on to become one of the world's best defenders. When he was buried in Medellin, 120,000 people lined the streets.

Since 1998, Colombia have not qualified for a World Cup. Asprilla and Valderrama no longer wanted to play for the national team after what happened. Defender Chonta Herrera had a nervous breakdown.

A generation initially inspired by their captain Escobar – known as El Caballero del Futbol or 'the gentleman of football' – was suddenly repelled from the game by his brutal murder. The reasons behind it remain unknown.

Medellin police speculated at the time that it could have been because of an argument about the own goal. Some claim it was linked to huge betting losses sustained by criminal gangs, while others insist it was just another act of violence that was indicative of the time.

Humberto Castro Muñoz confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison, serving just 11. Two former employees of Pablo Escobar, the Gallón brothers, were acquitted.

Since then, the country has been rebuilding, attempting to cleanse the bad and paint a new picture in their hero Andres Escobar's image.

Like a fiery yellow phoenix the national team has finally emerged from the flames in his World Cup. A nation is in love with football again.
