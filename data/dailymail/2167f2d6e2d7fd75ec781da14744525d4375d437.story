A Minneapolis weatherman made an entire newsroom crack up in laughter after he realized he left hanger in his suit and pulled it out on air.

Steve Frazier was sitting at the news desk with two anchors when he realized his suit was fitting a bit tighter than usual. 

Midway through a comment on cold weather, Frazier stops and apologies, reaching into the back of his suit jacket, only to find a wire hanger.

He paused mid-sentence to reach into the back of his suit, only to find a hanger that he forgot to take out when he put the jacket on

The news anchors burst into laughter on live TV as Frazier sets the hanger on the desk, saying that he thought the suit was feeling tight because of a button.

'It felt weird and I noticed it when it was too late,' the Fox 9 weatherman added.

Frazier then cut to the weather map, attempting to continue the weather roundup, but his laughs got the best of him.

He returned on screen and explained how he ended up with a coat hanger in his suit.  

He apparently forgot to take the hanger out of his jacket when he was leaving the gym..

'I went to the gym today and the suit was fitting tight and I couldn't figure out why but I must have put it on to quick,' he said.
