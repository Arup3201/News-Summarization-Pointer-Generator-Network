Two people were killed and at least 15 injured in Cairo today, officials said, amid anger over sentences given to football fans for their roles in a deadly stadium riot last year.

Officals said one protester died from the effects of teargas outside the Semiramis Intercontinental hotel in downtown Cairo and confirmed another death, while five more people were injured in the same area.

Another 10 protesters are suffering smoke inhalation after the clashes while others were injured by rubber bullets.

The ruling enraged residents of Port 
Said, at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal, by upholding death 
sentences imposed on 21 local football fans for their role in the riot 
last year when 74 people were killed and 1,000 left injured.

Up to 2,000 protesters in the city tried unsuccessfully to block the canal and disrupt international shipping.

But the court also angered rival fans
in Cairo by acquitting a further 28 defendants that they wanted 
punished, including seven members of the police force which is reviled 
across society for its brutality under deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

Fans of Cairo's Al-Ahly club stormed 
Egypt's Soccer Federation headquarters earlier and and set it on fire 
after a court acquitted seven of the nine police officials on trial for 
their alleged role in the Port Said stadium riot last year.

The
Egyptian interior ministry declared a state of emergency amid claims 
that jihadists could attack police, according to the state news agency.

The twin fires sent plumes of thick black smoke billowing out over the Cairo skyline.

Fire also swept through a nearby police club, but it was not immediately clear whether Al-Ahly fans were responsible for that blaze as well.

Heavy black smoke billowed out of the rose-colored, three-storey neocolonial building in central Cairo. 

The court also sentenced two senior police officers to 15 years in prison, but acquitted the other seven security officials.

Thousands of the club's fans had 
gathered to welcome the death penalty verdicts, mostly given to fans of 
rival club Al-Masry, who started the riot.

They appeared divided on whether to welcome the verdicts or consider them flawed.

'We came for the rulings on the defendants from the police,' said one fan who refused to give his name.

'Why should I be happy when most of them were acquitted?'

Said Sayyid, 21, told Reuters: 'This is a just verdict and has calmed us all down. Our martyrs have been vindicated.'

In
a ruling shown on live television, the Cairo court also sentenced five 
more people to life in jail for their roles in the riot and acquitted 28.

The remaining defendants received shorter jail sentences of between one to 15 years.

The court also sentenced the city's former security chief, Major General Essam Samak, to 15 years in prison.

Samak was the most senior of the nine 
security officials tried for their part in the riot.

In Cairo there were celebrations but also anger at police officials walking free from court

Those sentenced to death, mostly fans of Port Said's Al-Masry club, will be hanged.

The case has provoked deadly clashes in the Suez Canal city. Some 40 people died in riots after the death sentences were first announced on January 26, many shot by police.

Many
residents of Port Said, which is located on the Mediterranean at the 
northern tip of the Suez Canal, have seen the trial as unjust and 
politicised.

Before the verdict, Al-Ahly fans gathered at the club in Cairo

Football fans in the city have felt that authorities were biased in favor of Al-Ahly, Egypt's most powerful club.

The final whistle of the match between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly on February 1 last year prompted more than 
13,000 home fans, armed with knives, iron bars and machetes, to storm 
the pitch and attack rival Al-Ahly players and their 1,200 supporters.

Authorities shut off the stadium lights after the game, plunging it into darkness.

In the exit corridor, the fleeing 
crowd pressed against a chained gate until it broke open. Many were 
crushed under the crowd of people trying to flee.

Others fell or were thrown from terraces. It was Egypt's worst football disaster.

The response of Al-Ahly fans was at first muted compared to the wild celebrations following the January death sentences.

In Port Said, a city that has for 
weeks been in open rebellion against the government of Islamist 
President Mohammed Morsi, several hundred people, many of them relatives
of the defendants, gathered outside the local government offices to 
vent their anger. 

Port 
Said has been the centre of the heaviest violence in the latest wave of 
unrest, which began on January 25, when hundreds of thousands across the
country marked the second anniversary of the start of the uprising that
toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime two years ago.

The unrest has underlined worsening security in Egyptian cities since the 2011 overthrow of Mubarak, said the Associated Press.

The Islamist government of President Mohamed Mursi is struggling to halt the slide in law and order, hampered by a strike by some protesting police.

At least eight people have been killed in Port Said this week, including three policemen.
