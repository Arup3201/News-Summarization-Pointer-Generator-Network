The 2014 World Cup came to an end on Sunday evening with Germany getting their hands on the prestigious trophy for the fourth time in the tournament's history.

The focus has now quickly turned away from Brazil to the 2018 World Cup in Russia less than 24 hours after this year's competition had drawn to a close.

The Russian 2018 World Cup team have released 11 posters as they prepare to host the competition for the very first time.

Hosts: Moscow and Saint Petersburg are among the 11 host cities for the 2018 World Cup

Animal fun: A tiger is the main focus on Kazan's World Cup poster while a bird is wrapped around a football in Saransk's World Cup poster

Winter climate: Sochi highlight their arctic conditions while an imitation footballer appears in Kaliningrad's poster

They have created 11 posters to publicise the Russian cities which will be hosting the tournament in four years' time.   

Russian capital Moscow and Sochi, who played host to the 2014 Winter Olympics, are among the cities who will be gearing up for the World Cup. 

Russia will be hoping they progress to the later rounds of the 2018 World Cup after they were eliminated in the group stages of this year's tournament after failing to pick up three points against Algeria, South Korea and Belgium.

Underachievers: Manager Fabio Capello failed to guide Russia out of the World Cup group stages
