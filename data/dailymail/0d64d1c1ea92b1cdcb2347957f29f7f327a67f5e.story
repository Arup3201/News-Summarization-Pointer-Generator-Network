David Cameron is promoting the Christian values of Christmas in his sermon, praising those who help their communities

David Cameron will today issue a highly religious Christmas message in a bid to rescue his Big Society concept.

The Prime Minister praises those who help out in their communities for putting ‘their faith into action’, saying: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’.

Mr Cameron once likened his Anglican faith to the reception of Magic FM in the Chilterns, admitting that ‘it comes and goes’.

But he is keen to reaffirm his Christianity in his message today, showing that he is more than happy to ‘do God’.

‘For me, this season is a time to think about the meaning of Christmas – the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that gives to millions,’ he says.

‘In Handel’s Messiah, these words from the Prophet Isaiah are brilliantly put to music: “His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace”.’

Mr Cameron also invokes scripture in a bid to revive the Big Society, his concept that charities and other groups should step in to help at times of austerity, which failed to win over voters at the election.

The idea has been periodically revived but many Tory MPs believe that the Prime Minister’s failure to explain it properly to voters helped to cost him a majority in 2010.

‘There are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too – being good neighbours, running clubs and voluntary associations, playing their part in countless small ways to help build what I call the “big society”,’ he says.

‘Many of these people are Christians who live out to the letter that verse in Acts, that “it is more blessed to give than to receive”. These people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do.’

Mr Cameron also uses his message to reflect on the past year, claiming that the country has pulled together in tough times.

The remarks will also be seen as an attempt to revive the Big Society concept

He says: ‘Looking back, 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face.

‘Together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families.

‘This progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day, putting in the hours, running businesses and keeping our economy going.’

Mr Cameron welcomes the arrival of Justin Welby as the new Archbishop of Canterbury and Pope Francis. ‘Both have come in with exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches, which should inspire Christians around the world,’ he says.

The Prime Minister also praises the ‘brave service women and men who are helping bring peace here and around the world’ and those in ‘the emergency and caring services who are working hard to support those in need  this Christmas’.

More than Christanity: Ed Miliband (left) and Nick Clegg (right), who both don't believe in God, stress the importance of spending time with family in their Christmas messages

In messages delivered by other party leaders, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, an avowed atheist, insists that Christmas is about more than Christianity.

It is, of course, one of the biggest events in the Christian calendar – a time for hope, kindness, family, and goodwill,’ he says on video.

‘For Christians it is a celebration of the birth of Jesus as a gift from God and someone who embodied the values of love and forgiveness to which we should all aspire. But what is so extraordinary about this time of year is that it brings together the whole country – religious, non-religious, Christian, non-Christian – to embrace these values and celebrate together.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was raised in a Jewish family but is not a believer in God, made clear that his Christmas break would not have religious connotations.

‘Christmas is a special time of the year for many people,’ he says. ‘Lots of us take a break from the everyday pressures of work to spend time together with friends and family, strengthening the relationships that mean so much to us.

‘I would like to pay particular tribute to the many people, churches and charities who will be looking after those who are alone or homeless this Christmas time.

‘We should also pay tribute to those who will be working so that the rest of us have an enjoyable break, especially our medical staff, our police and our Armed Forces, thank you for your service.’

Mr Cameron’s Christian message comes after shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander suggested public figures have allowed ‘political correctness’ to prevent them talking about faith and the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, and Prince Charles warned that Christianity was beginning to ‘disappear’ from its own birthplace, as Islamists ‘deliberately target’ communities.
