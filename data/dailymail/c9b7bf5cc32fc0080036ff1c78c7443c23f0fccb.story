Manchester United scouts have again been
in attendance at Dundee United's fixtures as they continue to monitor 
Ryan Gauld, Andy Robertson and John Souttar.

United
have asked about Dinamo Zagreb's teenage striker Robert Muric. The 
father of the highly-rated 17 year-old, Branko, admits his son could be 
on the move after claiming Zagreb have been trying to hide him from 
Barcelona and Chelsea by keeping scouts away from games.

David
Moyes is continuing to look for younger talent as well as those ready 
to step into the first team. United's playing staff is ready for an 
overhaul and they are keen to have better quality youngsters coming 
through which will also mean further tweaks to United's scouting set-up 
at home and abroad.

Tottenham 
asked about taking Alexander Buttner on loan but United are not keen to 
do their rivals any favours. Buttner is available but a move abroad is 
more likely. Moyes still wants a left-back but will not be bidding for 
Fabio Coentrao or Leighton Baines.

Tottenham have already moved onto other left-back targets and are determined to sign a second striker in the January window.

Jermain
Defoe's much-heralded £6million move to Toronto should be formally 
announced by the MLS side next week with the England striker linking up 
with his new team ahead of the MLS season in March.

No go: David Moyes will not bid for Fabio Coentrao (left) or Leighton Baines

Meanwhile,
Toronto defender Richard Eckersley is keen on a return to England. The 
24-year-old has offers from LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls but the 
former Manchester United full back is open to a deal in the 
Championship.

West Ham face a tough task to persuade Rickie Lambert to leave Southampton.

Chairman David Sullivan has moved to save his club by changing tack on their initial transfer policy and putting an offer to Southampton for the 31-year-old England striker.

West Ham were planning to just bring in two strikers on loan mindful that relegation would leave them with a financial headache. Now they have opted to take a gamble and make a bid that would be attractive to Southampton and the player.

Lambert is very settled at Southampton but, as he isn't starting every week, Sam Allardyce senses an opportunity to bring him to Upton Park with the prospect of regular football every week in the build up to the World Cup. Should Andy Carroll make his return, it could also prove an England audition for a rumbustious partnership which few defences would fancy facing.

West Ham are still lining up other options in case the plan fails. They have asked about Papiss Cisse at Newcastle although that has been rebuffed but loan deals are ready to move over the next week should they get the ok on finance. They have considered Ishak Belfodil, 21, from Inter Milan but he is expected to move elsewhere.

Everton's John Heitinga will be announced as a West Ham player in the next few days.

Thomas Ince may yet turn down Swansea's overtures when they make a move for him this week. Manager Michael Laudrup is considering a £4million bid for the England U21 forward but Ince may yet see out his contract.

Crystal Palace have also made approaches for Ince, who has been watched by Ajax and Inter Milan. Blackpool have made the 21-year-old a new contract offer but, if he goes abroad, the Championship side will get around £155,000 in compensation, as opposed to a few million if he moves in England.

Chelsea's Michael Essien could be the latest Premier League export to the MLS. The 31-year-old is ready to leave Stamford Bridge with clubs in the Middle East and across the Atlantic alerted by comments from his agent Fabien Piveteau early this week. Essien has been linked with Middlesbrough but he has grander ambitions

The west London club, who formally completed the signing of 18-year-old midfielder Bertrand Traore on Wednesday, are monitoring Lokeren winger Ayanda Patosi but are unsure about a bid as the player looks a few years short of development. The 21-year-old South African has impressed scouts but seems more likely to move to Holland with Ajax among his potential suitors.

Manchester City are continuing to develop their youth ranks and will hold talks with another Nigerian teenager on Thursday. Chidibere Nwakali is from the Shuttle Sports Academy in Lagos and is a teammate of striker Kelechi Iheanacho from Nigeria's U17 World Cup squad.

Nwakali is a left-sided midfielder who can also play behind the striker or as a left-back. He is due to fly to England with his parents tomorrow for talks in the hope of concluding a dream transfer to City.

Iheanacho's deal with City now looks back on after hitting a hitch, seemingly over money, last week.African football website MTNFootball.com reported: 'Both the agents in the US and those in London are now co-operating to get visas to the UK for the Iheanachos so that they meet with Manchester City officials on the contract they have signed. You could therefore say the transfer is back on track.'

Issues to be discussed would include the January 2015 payments to the player, his father and the Taye Football Academy in Owerri. The Iheanachos recently signed for City in Madrid, Spain, after Kelechi passed a medical attended by City’s chief scout Gary Worthington. However, when they discovered they would not be paid immediately due to his age, they explored the possibilities of reviving interest at Porto. 

There were rumours too that Iheanacho’s US-based agent tried to offer the 17-year-old to Spanish La Liga club Getafe.

Newcastle have made an enquiry for St Etienne defender Nathan Dekoke. The 17-year-old has also been a target for Fulham. The France U18 star can play at centre half and full back and Newcastle may make an offer this week.

They are continuing to work the French market with success and, as reported previously in Sportsmail, are ready to have another go for Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis who is out of contract in the summer and attracting interest from Marseille and Crystal Palace.

Newcastle defender Steven Taylor is still keen to get back playing top-level football and is looking to leave St James' Park on loan.

The 27-year-old defender has not figured since being sent off against Manchester City in August and has been urged to wait for his chance by manager Alan Pardew but although he could figure in the FA Cup this weekend, his patience could run out if the situation continues.

Even though Taylor is a supporter of the club, he is prepared to leave on loan to revive his career.

Meanwhile, Newcastle winger Sylvain Marveaux is wanted by Greek side Olympiacos.

Which
Premier League star is looking to leave the country after running into 
trouble with too many female friends?

The powerful midfielder is a 
popular figure at his club in more ways than one. Although not married, 
he has three regular girlfriends on the go and is keen for a fresh 
start. 

Burnley's opening bid for Brighton striker Ashley Barnes could trigger a reaction from their rivals. The Championship promotion chasers want cover with Danny Ings subject of interest from Premier League clubs. Barnes, 24, is out of contract in the summer and is also wanted by League One Wolves but if a deal is agreed with Burnley other Championship sides may yet come in with rival bids and better wages.

Wolves manager Kenny Jackett would like to team Barnes with Bradford City's £3m-rated striker Nahki Wells. Burnley and Wolves also enquired about Chelsea's Patrick Bamford who is to join Derby County on loan and Coventry City's Leon Clarke.

Celtic are keen on Wolves striker Leigh Griffiths but have other options also. Manager Neil Lennon is also poised to make an offer for Huddersfield Town midfielder Oliver Norwood, formerly of Manchester United, but Town will not sell cheaply

Hull face surprising competition for Celtic striker Georgios Samaras in the shape of Atletico Madrid. Steve Bruce remains keen on Manchester United's Nick Powell also as do Swansea and is continuing to monitor developments with Shane Long and the more expensive target, Steven Fletcher of Sunderland. 

In demand: Georgios Samaras is sought after by both Hull City and, surprisingly, Atletico Madrid

Crystal Palace are hoping to tie up a deal for Blackburn Rovers defender Scott Dann amid talk he is leaving his long-time agent. Blackburn are keen to lose Dann's estimated £35,000 a week wages and have other eyes on other defenders.

The return of Lucas Neill, who has been training with the club, on a short term deal has not been ruled out. Blackburn also hope to complete a permanent deal for Cardiff striker Rudy Gestede.

Fulham are awaiting a response over their enquiry for 6ft 7in Danish striker Simon Makienok. Crystal Palace and Stoke have also watched the Brondby striker, who is available for £3.5million, but have yet to follow up with a bid. The 23-year-old scored six goals in 12 games last season and turned down a move to Russian side Terek Grozny.

Fancy it? Giant Dane Simon Makienok may be at Craven Cottage by the end of the month
