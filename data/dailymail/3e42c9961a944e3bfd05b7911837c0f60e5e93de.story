Louis van Gaal may be one of the stern faces in the Premier League but the Manchester United manager showed his humorous side in a press conference on Friday afternoon.

The Dutchman took journalists by surprise with his double dose of comedy, rebuffing a question about fitness updates before pretending to walk out of the room.

Asked about the expected return dates if his injured players, Van Gaal said: 'It's very difficult to say and it's also not good to say, because then I lay pressure on the evaluation.

'After three weeks you will say: "Louis, Louis, why is he not fit enough". That's not good, it's not good for the players and it's not good for me. Only good for you maybe!'

The 63-year-old is still searching for his first Premier League victory as United manager, but will be hoping to pick up three points against QPR on Sunday.

When asked about his previous comments on his squad needing time to settle, Van Gaal pretended to leave the room after saying: 'I have not spoke a lot. You have asked. I don't want to say anything, I can go away.'
