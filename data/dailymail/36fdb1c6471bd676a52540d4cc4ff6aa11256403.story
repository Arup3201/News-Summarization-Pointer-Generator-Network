The families of two British hostages who were beheaded by IS extremists have come together in show of unity at a memorial service for one of the murdered men.

British aid worker David Haines, 44, was killed by IS militants in Syria last month after spending more than a year as a hostage.  

Michael Haines called on people to join together and 'find a single act of unity' in the wake of the barbaric killing of his brother.

The father-of-two was taken hostage in Syria while working for international relief agency Acted in March last year.

He had been been helping refugees in a camp near the Turkish border when he was snatched by Islamic State (IS) militants.

Tributes were paid to him at a memorial service in his home town of Perth, which was attended by more than 600 people. 

The family of Alan Henning, who was also killed by IS, paid their respects to the Scottish aid worker. 

Barbara Henning, who had travelled to Perth with her two children, and Michael Haines, stood together and held hands outside the church before going in for the service.

Mr Haines's brother Michael addressed family, friends and colleagues.

He called on people to join together and 'find a single act of unity' in the wake of the barbaric killing of his brother.

His 17-year-old daughter Bethany had called for IS to be 'eradicated'.

Mr Haines' family said the event would be a celebration of his life, and asked for donations to the charity Hostage UK instead of flowers.

They also asked for those attending the service at Perth Congregational Church to wear brightly-coloured clothes.

Serving or former Armed Forces personnel attending were asked to wear their berets in recognition of Mr Haines' service in the RAF.

RAF personnel formed a guard of honour, while crowds gathered in the street as the service took place.

The minister who led the service, the Reverend Gordon Campbell, said Mr Haines was a 'son of Perth' whose legacy needed to be celebrated.

Speaking after the service, he said: 'It was billed as being a service of celebration and thanksgiving.

'We started off by saying that, despite what people might think, you are allowed to smile, or even laugh, in church.

'And there was laughter. There were tears as well but a lot of laughter. And sometimes tears and laughter are not as far apart as you imagine.'

Mr Haines and Ms Henning have written a joint letter calling for 'acts of unity' against IS militants. 

'Together we have the power to defeat the most hateful acts,' they said.

'We condemn those who seek to drive us apart and spread hatred by attempting to place blame on Muslims and the Islamic faith for the actions of these terrorists,' the letter stated.

The pair said they have been overwhelmed by messages of support from around the world. 

Mr Haines, who was born in Holderness in Yorkshire and raised in Perth, had previously done relief work in post-war Croatia, where he eventually settled with his second wife

Mr Haines, who was born in Holderness in Yorkshire and raised in Perth, had previously done relief work in post-war Croatia, where he eventually settled with his second wife and four-year-old daughter, as well as working in Libya and South Sudan.

Primer Minister David Cameron condemned his death as an 'act of pure evil'.  

Hundreds of people attended a memorial service for Mr Henning last week, while Mr Cameron this week said he would consider recognising the murdered aid worker with a national honour.

In a separate video message, Michael Haines said he wanted other families to understand that terrorism and extremism was not 'something that happened to other people', adding: 'It affects us all.'

'Together we have the power to defeat the most hateful acts,' he said.

He said his brother was an 'ordinary guy from Perth who did extraordinary things'.

'My brother's killers want to hurt all of us and stop us from believing in the very things that took David in conflict zones,' he said.

'My brother didn't see nationalities or religions, he just saw other human beings in need of a little help to get by - or sometimes a lot of help to live to see another day.

'This is how my family will remember him,' he added.

IS has killed two other Western hostages in the past two months - US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - and is holding the British journalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in a series of propaganda videos.
