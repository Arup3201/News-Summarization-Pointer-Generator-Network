A Celtic punk rock band has given a Wisconsin governor a press clear message about using their song as entrance music, telling him 'we literally hate you'.

Scott Walker used the Dropkick Murphys song 'I'm Shipping Up to Boston' for his entrance music at the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday.

The band tweeted: 'Please stop using our music in any way…we literally hate you !!! Love, Dropkick Murphys.'

The Dropkick Murphys have told Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to stop using their song, 'I'm Shipping Up To Boston'; the politician used it as entrance music at a recent summit

The band's song, originally written by Woody Guthrie, is their biggest hit and was used in the Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning film The Departed.

Guthrie is a folk singer famous for his left-wing protest songs. 

This isn't the first time Dropkick Murphys, who have a close relationship with workers' rights activists, have taken a swipe at Gov. Walker.

The band was also criticized his 'anti-union' policies. 

Dropkick Murphys isn't the first band to take issue with politicians using their music to promote themselves. 

John Mellencamp, pictured above with Meg Ryan, has also taken issue with Gov Walker using his songs

John Mellencamp complained to Gov. Walker for using his song 'Small Town' and Tom Petty sent a cease-and-desist order to George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, requesting he stop playing his hit, 'I Won't Back Down'.

And during the last presidential race, the Somali-born rapper K'naan protested when his music was used by Republican candidate Mitt Romney, whose playlist later featured musicians with conservative views such as Meat Loaf.
