His name is one of the most famous in the world of sport - yet almost nobody knows who the man was.

Roland Garros has become synonymous with clay court tennis since the French Open was named in his honour in 1928.

Now, his name is daubed in green and rust-red 
on almost every surface available to marketeers at Stade Roland 
Garros in Paris - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats.

You might think he would at least have something to do with tennis.

Dashing: Born on the French isle of Reunion in 1888, Garros grew into one of the most important pioneers of world aviation before becoming a daredevil dog-fighter during the First World War

Brave: Roland Garros (left of propeller, in beret) is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage-mounted machine-gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself

'For a lot of people in France and abroad, Garros is a tennis man, or a sometime president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT),' Michael Guittard, head of collections and cultural mediation at the FFT, told CNN.

'Everybody knows the name of Roland Garros, but nobody knows who he was. That's why we have an exhibition to explain that he is not a tennis champion, but a hero of World War One.'

Born on the French isle of Reunion in 1888, Garros grew into one of the most important pioneers of world aviation before becoming a daredevil dog-fighter during the First World War.

Such was his bravery, that he is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage-mounted machine-gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself.

He went on to shoot down three more over the Western Front, bringing his kill-count to four - one short of the required tally of a recognised 'flying ace'.

Here is one account of the day Garros was captured in 1915, published in the 'Schwabishen Merkur' newspaper by a Württemberger cavalry medical officer.

'At about 7 o'clock in the evening of 18 April two enemy aircraft, flying very high, appeared over the area between Sainte-Katherine and Lendelede. One was shot at by one of our Ballonabwehrkanone and he disappeared in the direction of Menin.

'The other flew away over Lendelede in a north-easterly direction. At that moment we saw a southbound train approaching on the railway line Ingelmunster-Kortrijk. Suddenly the plane went into a steep dive of about 60 degrees from a height of about 2,000 metres to about 40 metres from the ground.

'He flew over the train in a loop and as he rose up into the sky again with his wings almost vertical, he threw a bomb at the train. Fortunately it missed the target and there was no damage.

'The bomb landed about 40 metres east of the track and blew a crater about one metre deep and two metres in diameter. The driver of the locomotive brought the train to a stop.As the plane had swooped down over the train the Bahnschutzwache troops had fired on it following my order to open fire. We shot at him from a distance of only 100 metres as he flew past.

'After he had thrown his bomb at the train he tried to escape, switching his engine on again and climbing to about 700 metres through the shots fired by our troops. But suddenly the plane began to sway about in the sky, the engine fell silent, and the pilot began to glide the plane down in the direction of Hulste.'I immediately got on on my bicycle and set off to chase the plane, accompanied by some of the men from my unit on foot. As soon as the plane landed the pilot set it on fire and ran to a farmhouse in Hulst.

'I was the first to arrive at the scene of the burning plane. Several others soon joined me and my men, including some dragoons from a Württemberger cavalry brigade, as we searched for the airman in Hulste.'

But his greatest achievement was to invent a machine gun that could be fired forward through a plane's propeller arc.

Until Garros, the only way airmen could shoot at enemy planes was with handheld guns from the cockpit.

So Garros masterminded a method of attaching wedge-shaped steel plates to the propeller that deflected stray bullets from hitting the blades.

'The rate of fire was that most of the bullets would miss the propeller, but every so often one would strike it,' Peter Jakab, chief curator at the U.S.'s Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum told CNN. 'It wasn't very efficient, but in the very early months of the war when airplanes were either defenseless or carrying hand-held weapons, this technique made his aircraft more lethal than anything flying.'

He added: 'Over a very short period of time he shot down a number of German airplanes and created quite some terror among the German pilots.'

But his tyranny over the skies could not last forever, ending when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash-land behind enemy lines in April 1915.

He was captured by German troops before he was able to destroy his plane and, crucially, his state-of-the-art machine gun that had unleashed such fear on his airborne combatants.

Within hours of his capture, the machine-gun firing device and the Morane's propellor were sent to the Fokker aircraft factory in Germany.

It was a mere few weeks later that the Dutchman Anthony Fokker produced the first single-seater airplane - the Fokker EI - for the German Air Force fitted with machine-guns, deflectors and an interrupter gear which could synchronise the rate of fire of the gun with the speed of the propellor.

Over the next three years, while Garros languished as a prisoner of war, Fokker was busy honing the Frenchman's design into a synchronization gear that stopped bullets hitting the propeller altogether.

The results were devastating as Germany's Fokker D VII planes, mounted with the new device, began downing allied aircraft in their dozens, prompting the British press to coin the phrase the 'Fokker Scourge.'

While Garros was 'one of the early pioneers of developing a tactic in an aircraft-specific
 role', according to Jakab, dog-fighting tactics and formation flying changed dramatically while he was in prison.

By the time he escaped in 1918, his methods of airborne warfare had become outdated and he was shot down and killed on October 5 that year - a day before his 30th birthday and five weeks before Armistice Day on November 11 - near the French town of Vouziers, close to the Belgian border.

His killer was flying a Fokker D VII.

Pioneer: In 1912, two years after making his first flight, Garros won the prestigious Circuit de Anjou flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea on September 23 1913, as depicted in this issue of Le Petit Journal

Recognised: There is a statue of Roland Garros in Saint-Denis, Reunion, where he was born in 1888

Renowned: Now, his name is daubed in green and rust-red on almost every surface available to marketeers at Paris' Stade Roland Garros - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats

'He was surpassed by the war and by this technique that he had pioneered,' added Jakab. 'But he was a great war hero.'

But Garros is not only remembered for his wartime heroics.

In 1911 Garros began flying Blériot monoplanes entering a number of European races, including the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race and the Circuit of Europe (Paris-London-Paris), in which he came second.

In September that year he established a new world altitude record of 5,610 m (18,410 ft)

In 1912, two years after making his first flight, he won the prestigious Circuit de Anjou flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea on September 23 1913.
