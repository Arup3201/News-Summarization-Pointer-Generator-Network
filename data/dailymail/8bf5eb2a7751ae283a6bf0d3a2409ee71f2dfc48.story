The man who allegedly murdered his wife then posted a picture of her body on Facebook could have clashed with her after he slept in and missed a planned date night, it has emerged.

Shortly before Jennifer Alonso was shot dead by Derek Medina, she sent a string of messages to a friend expressing anger with her husband and frustration over their recent marriage problems.

Medina, 31, has pleaded not guilty to murder, and is expected to argue that he gunned down his wife in self-defense at their home in Miami after she had been abusing him.

Facebook messages between Ms Alonso, 26, and her friend Kelly Barry reveal that the alleged victim was upset with her husband in the hours before her death on August 8, according to the Miami Herald.

Shortly after 7am, she wrote: 'Dude... der [Medina] was supposed to wake us up last night. To watch a movie. He promised me... I feel like I'm begging for him to hang out with us. I already know what his excuse is going to be - that his alarm didn't go off.'

She added: 'He doesn't give a s***. He called me a b**** LOL... I feel like I want to leave.'

After the two friends had discussed the matter for a while, Ms Alonso thanked Ms Barry for calming her down, writing: 'I felt like ripping his face off an hour ago.'

She then added: 'He just woke up. He came in the room, and then he walked out. Didn't say anything... I need to calm down because I feel like I'm about to explode.'

It is thought that Medina could argue self-defense in the case, claiming that his wife cut him with a knife before he killed her

The messages stopped around 10am, just a few minutes before Medina is believed to have shot Ms Alonso before photographing her body and posting the pictures on his Facebook page.

Ms Barry passed a record of the exchange to investigators last month, saying it 'might be helpful to you'.

Ms Alonso herself recorded her stormy relationship with Medina - whom she divorced last year before remarrying him three months later - in a diary with the title, 'The mind of an insane woman'.

She wrote: 'When we love each other it's GREAT. But when we hate each other we HATE each other.'

Home surveillance footage released last month by prosecutors does not show the fatal exchange which happens out of the frame.

But Medina claims he shot her in self-defence after she started hitting him 'several times with a closed fist,' according to police documents seen by the Miami Herald.

The video shows Alfonso in the kitchen at the sink. When Medina enters, the couple move out of the frame, but at one point Medina's head is seen flinching backwards.

Medina claims his wife had grabbed a knife and he had disarmed her and put the knife back in a drawer, but then she started punching him. 

Then the footage shows Medina leave 
the kitchen and come straight back. He told police he went upstairs to 
get a gun, according to the Miami Herald.

Moments later white particles fly past the lens in several clouds, a sign of gunfire.

Medina then walks out of the kitchen, comes back holding his phone and pauses in the doorway.

As
he walks away again the light from his phone is on. This is when, 
police say, he took the photo of the body. All the while Alfonso's 
ten-year-old daughter from another relationship was upstairs. She was 
unhurt.

Medina is seen coming into the kitchen shortly after Alfonso moves away from the sink. A brief exchange is seen in the corner of the frame, before the debris flies past the camera lens

He then gets a jacket and returns to the kitchen entrance and looks again in the direction of the body as he puts it on.

Calmly, he leaves the property. The next frame is of police and paramedics arriving at the couple's home.

A Facebook post from Medina read 'Rip Jennifer Alfonso' alongside a picture of her slumped backwards on the kitchen floor.

He
wrote on his Facebook page: 'I’m going to prison or death sentence for 
killing my wife. Love you guys. Miss you guys. Take care. Facebook 
people you’ll see me in the news.'

Medina
claims his wife was abusive. He wrote on Facebook: 'My wife was 
punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did 
what I did I hope u understand me.'

Medina's
lawyers have asked to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on 
Alfonso's body. It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in 
self-defence.

The diary of 
his late wife has also been been seized by police. Some entries are 
happy while others highlight the difficult nature of their relationship.

She
admits she struggled with feelings of jealousy and believed he was 
looking at other women. Her entries also reveal how she struggled with 
her confidence and one one occasion 'negative thoughts and memories 
plagued her mind'.

Smoke and debris: Clouds of gun smoke and debris can be seen on home surveillance footage in the Derek Medina murder trial, in which Medina, who has confessed to shooting his wife, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder

After calmly putting on his jacket, Medina then left the property, captured on a different camera

According to the Miami-Dade affidavit the couple had been squabbling since they woke up on the morning of the shooting.

At
about 10am, Alfonso was upstairs, and Medina threatened her with his 
.380-caliber pistol. The shooting happened later when Alfonso was in the
kitchen.

Medina's father, 
Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a monster and it was the
other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.'

Medina was a part-time extra on the USA Network show Burn Notice.

The
wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and 
dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a 
background extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in 
2010.

He has also 
self-published a number of self-help e-books, one titled: 'How I Saved 
Someone's Life and Marriage and Family Problems Thru Communication.'

Alfonso was a waitress at Denny's.
