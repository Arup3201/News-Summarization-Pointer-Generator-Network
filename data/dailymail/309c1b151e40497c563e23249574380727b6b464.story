Labour Party leader Ed Miliband says expressing fears over the economic impact of an influx of low-skilled migrants is not 'prejudiced'

More British workers will ‘lose out’ from the influx of cheap labour from Romania and Bulgaria, Ed Miliband has admitted.

The Labour leader insisted it was not ‘prejudiced’ to believe that growing numbers of low-skilled migrants from the European Union would add to the problem of low pay and poor job security.

Days after restrictions on workers from eastern Europe were lifted, Mr Miliband also called for a legal loophole to be closed which allows British workers to pay foreign workers less.

From the start of 2014 curbs workers from Romania and Bulgaria coming to Britain have been lifted, raising fears of a fresh influx of cheap labour under-cutting people who already live in the UK.

Mr Miliband warned that it would mean many British workers would be left worse off.

Writing in the Independent on Sunday, the Labour leader said: ‘Labour won't conduct this debate in the shrill way that this Government does, for example, trundling vans through our cities telling people to "Go Home".

‘Instead, we will reform an economy hard-wired into a cycle of low wages, low skills, insecure jobs and high prices that is tearing into the living standards of ordinary families.

‘It means taking measures to stop unscrupulous employers using workers from abroad to undercut wages and worsen conditions.’

He hinted at radical reform of the UK economy to tackle the problem.

‘Unless we act to change our economy, low-skill immigration risks making the problems of the cost of living crisis worse for those at the sharp end,’ Mr Miliband added.

‘When millions of workers already have low pay and poor job security in Britain and we add high levels of low skilled migration mostly from within the EU, some benefit but some lose out.’

He added: ‘It isn't prejudiced to believe that.’

The Labour leader said he wanted to address ‘understandable’ public fears over lifting work restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians, conceding some UK nationals ‘lose out’ as a result of new arrivals.

But while he backed stronger border controls and ‘fair’ benefit curbs, the key was ending the country's ‘chronic dependency on low-skill, low-wage labour’.

Among steps Labour would take if it won the 2015 general election would be ending the ability of unscrupulous bosses to undercut regular staff by paying agency workers lower wages, he said.

The TUC claims agency staff are paid up to £135 a week less than permanent staff despite working in the same place and doing the same job because of a loophole in the Agency Workers' Directive.

Migrants are over-represented among the estimated one million agency workers in the UK, especially in sectors such as call centres, food production and logistics.

Mr Miliband said he would work with the business sector to end the practice.

Mr Miliband has conceded that the previous Labour administration was wrong not to impose transitional controls when Poland joined the EU - with far more arriving from there than anticipated.

PM David Camerson once again refused to be drawn on estimates for the number of migrants heading to the UK

No official estimates have been given of the number of Romanians and Bulgarians likely to take advantage of the end of the restrictions later imposed on their countries.

Today David Cameron again refused to give any indication of the number of people expected to arrive, despite schools, hospitals and other public services needing to plan for any major increase in population.

‘We are not making a forecast because I think it is unlikely we would get that forecast right,’ the Prime Minister told BC1’s Andrew Marr Show.

Amid claims up to 50,000 people could arrive, the government has rushed through measures restricting access to jobless benefits and NHS healthcare.

They came in the face of demands from Tories fearful of the threat posed by the eurosceptic UK Independence Party which is tipped to push the party into third place in May's European election.
