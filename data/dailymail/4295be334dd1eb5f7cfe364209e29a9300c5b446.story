Manchester City are confident of agreeing a new contract with James Milner despite interest from Liverpool.

The England midfielder has become an important member of the City squad and has even been deployed in a central striker role recently due to the injuries suffered by Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic.

And it appears the 29-year-old will remain at the Etihad beyond their 2014-15 campaign.

Milner has not rushed signing a new deal as he looks for reassurances over the amount of first-team football he will play under Manuel Pellegrini.

The delay in signing a new deal has given Brendan Rodgers hope that Milner could be tempted to move to Anfield.

The 53-cap midfielder has played 170 times for City since moving to the club in 2010, contributing 13 goals.
