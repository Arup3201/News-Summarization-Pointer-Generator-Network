The moon is getting its own reality TV show - with the culmination being a live broadcast from the lunar surface.

Science Channel and Discovery Channel today announced that the networks will serve as television homes for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, a $30 million competition for privately-funded teams to land an unmanned craft on the moon by December 31, 2015.

The networks will follow teams as they try to to land a craft on the surface of the moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit live pictures and video back to earth.

Live from the lunar surface: A view of the Earth appears over the Lunar horizon as the Apollo 11 Command Module comes into view of the Moon before Astronatus Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr. leave in the Lunar Module, Eagle, to become the first men to walk on the Moon's surface. TV firms hope a new contest to send a rover to the moon and beam back live pictures will be a hit

The Google Lunar XPRIZE, the largest international incentive based prize of all time, aims to do something we haven’t done as humanity since 1973 - safely land on the surface of the Moon.

'More than half of the world’s population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface,' say the organisers.

The Google Lunar XPRIZE aims to create a new “Apollo” moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 Million in incentive based prizes.

In order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the surface of the Moon, travel 500 meters above, below, or on the Lunar surface, and send back two 'Mooncasts' to Earth

The Science Channel and Discovery Channel will follow the entire process including testing, lift-off, and live coverage of the winning lunar landing, which is estimated to take place in 2015.

'In addition to the technological breakthroughs catalyzed by the Google Lunar Xprixe, we have an equally important goal of inspiring young scientists, engineers and space explorers,' said Robert Weiss of Xprize.

'More than half the world's population has never had the opportunity to experience a live broadcast from the moon.

'Partnering with Discovery Channel and Science Channel will allow us to engage the public around this milestone event, creating an 'Apollo Moment' for the next generation.'

TV firms hope the show will reignite interest in space.

July 20, 1969 shows astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, walking on the surface of the moon during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA). TV Executives say the new show could create an 'Apollo monent' for viewers

'The $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE offers all the ingredients of fantastic television; stakes, competition, big characters, and mind-blowing visuals. It's the perfect project for Science Channel and Discovery Channel to partner on,' said Eileen O'Neill, Group Vice President for Discovery Channel, Science Channel and Velocity.

'When the winning craft touches down on the moon's surface, it's going to trigger buzz and inspiration all over the world.

'Our intention is to provide a live, front-row seat to history being made.

The Penn State student design for a lander, which they hope will launch in 2015

Penn State students will compete in the show with their lander

One team of US university students has already unveiled an audacious plan to become the fourth people in history to land a spaceship on the moon.

The Penn State students say their project could even go one better - landing a craft that can take off and land at will, allowing it to explore the lunar surface easily.

They hope to launch on a commercial spacecraft in 2015 - if they can raise enough money.
