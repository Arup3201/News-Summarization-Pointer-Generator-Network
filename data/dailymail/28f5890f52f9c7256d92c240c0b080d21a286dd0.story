Theo Walcott made his long-awaited return from the knee injury that kept him out for nine months and wrecked his World Cup dream as Arsenal’s Under 21s were held by Blackburn.

The England star played 45 minutes of the match at Boreham Wood, easing himself back into competitive action after only returning to full training on Monday.

When Walcott was taken off on a stretcher in Arsenal’s FA Cup third round derby with Tottenham on January 4, nobody could have known it would be October 17, under the Friday night lights at modest Meadow Park, before we saw him again.

286 days have been lost from the 25-year-old’s career. 286 days of waiting for the knee ligaments to regain their strength to the point where he could accelerate away from defenders so stylishly once again.

Missing the World Cup would have hurt, as would being absent from Arsenal’s FA Cup triumph at Wembley in May and Walcott will desperately want to make up the lost time now he has returned. 

He said: ‘It’s just nice to get out there and do what I enjoy doing. I’ve really missed it and I’ve just wanted to get back fit. I’m pleased with tonight.

‘It’s important to recover well, you need to be patient. The manager will choose to play me when he wants, it’s not something that will happen overnight.’

Admitting that the nine-month absence was the hardest time in his career, Walcott vowed to come back stronger.

He added: ‘It’s been a good opportunity to work on something I've never worked on before, my leg strength. That period I was at academy I missed out on, that development stage in the gym. You work hard with the physios, I've managed to build myself and be stronger and fitter.’

This was a gentle reintroduction - there were a few tantalising glimpses of that trademark pace as he skipped away from the Blackburn defenders. 

There were also a few inaccurate passes and under-hit crosses as he tries to rediscover that sharpness, but that’s to be expected. 

With Arsene Wenger in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis, Walcott’s return to the competitive arena will be most welcome.

45 Walcott is withdrawn at half-time and replaced by Alex Iwobi

The Arsenal boss is without Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Yaya Sanogo for Saturday’s visit of Hull City. Every day seems to bring fresh injury headaches.

So there is a chance he’ll be in the squad for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Anderlecht but, on this evidence, he perhaps needs a few more minutes under his belt before his first-team introduction.

The first-half was a terrible spectacle, so it was a good job Walcott was in action to excite the larger-than-usual crowd for this Under 21 Premier League match.

Arsenal, who started the match fourth in the standings, were favourites and they made most of the running - often very quickly, with Chuba Akpom and Serge Gnabry causing problems with their speed.

Walcott’s first involvement saw him glide down the right and find Gnabry, only for the German’s snapshot to be blocked. Gnabry, himself returning from injury, then curled a 20-yard free-kick over the perimeter fence. 

Akpom, in excellent form this season and on target for England’s Under 19s in recent European qualifiers, showed a fine turn of pace to ping in a cross that was cut out.

Walcott did see a chance come his way, after 20 minutes following good link-up play involving Abou Diaby and Daniel Crowley, but he snatched at the shot.

Rovers did carry a threat at time, with the winger Connor Mahoney particularly dangerous. But it was the other flanker, Devarn Green whose dinked ball just eluded captain Bradley Bauress when clean through. 

Eight minutes before half-time, Arsenal keeper Ryan Huddart saved low from Darragh Lenihan as the visitors enjoyed their best spell.

The second period was even more tepid. Ryan Crump preserved Blackburn’s lead when he slid out to thwart Ainsley Maitland-Niles with about 20 minutes to play, before Akpom’s goal was disallowed for offside. 

Suddenly, Arsenal stepped things up - Alex Iwobi, who had replaced Walcott, back-heeled into the path of Crowley, whose powerful hit was beaten away by Crump at his near post.

They went even closer when Crowley’s free-kick was tipped on to the crossbar in the last 10 minutes but this one ended in stalemate.

But at least Arsenal fans have a favourite back again.
