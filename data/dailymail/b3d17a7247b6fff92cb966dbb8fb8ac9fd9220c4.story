The Palestinian
government called the murder of three young Muslims in North Carolina 'terrorist' killings and asked to be included in the US investigation in a statement Saturday. 

Police charged Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, with shooting Deah Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor
Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister Razan Abu-Salha, 19, in Chapel Hill on Tuesday.

Local authorities said they believe the killings followed a dispute over parking at the condominium complex where the four were neighbors, but Justice Department and FBI officials have launched an investigation into whether hate crime charges or other federal violations are warranted.

Calling Hicks 'an American extremist and hateful racist,' the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the shootings were indicative of rising anti-Muslim discrimination in the United States.

'We consider it a serious indication of the growth of racism
and religious extremism which is a direct threat to the lives of
hundreds of thousands of American citizens who follow the
Islamic faith,' said the ministry in a statement.

The statement made a request for 'a serious investigation and the involvement
of Palestinian investigators to clarify the circumstances of
these assassinations and premeditated murders.'

The father of the two women, Dr Mohammad Abu-Salha, called the killings a hate crime, echoing the demands of some Muslim groups for federal authorities to investigate.

'It was execution style, a bullet in every head,' Abu-Salha told the News Observer. 'This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime. 

The New York Times revealed that Hicks often made posts on Facebook disparaging organized religions like Islam.

But much of his rage also seemed directed at Christians, whose intelligence Hicks criticized because of their belief in the Bible and many of whose opposition to the planned mosque near the former site of New York's Twin Towers Hicks deemed hypocritical in a 2010 post. 

The Guardian reports that police found a dozen firearms and huge amounts of ammunition as they executed a warrant to search his apartment after the shooting.

President Obama issued a statement Friday deeming the killings 'brutal and outrageous' and said no one should be targeted for their religion.  

In the aftermath of the shooting, Hicks was described as menacing his young Muslim neighbors over trivial issues such as parking and noise complaints.

'This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt,' said Dr Abu-Salha. 'They were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.'

A friend of Yusor Abu-Salha, Amira Ata, told Fusion that Hicks visited the apartment one night after Ata had left, to complain about the couple having guests over, all the while casually holding a rifle.  

Police say that Hicks is cooperating, and that their preliminary investigation showed that the parking dispute was the motive.

There have also been questions over whether Hicks' anti-religious stance - which he freely shared on social media - had also been a factor in the murders.

Hicks posted a photo from United Atheists of America on Facebook February 8, which has the title 'Why are radical Christians and radical Muslims so opposed to each others' influence when they agree about so many ideological issues?'

On the page he is listed as married and having studied to become a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College. Records show his wife works at UNC Hospital.

Police were called to Summerwalk Circle after shots were heard at about 5.10pm on Tuesday. 

When they arrived they found three people dead. They had been shot in the head, CNN reported. 

According to their Facebook pages, Mr Barakat had married his wife just over a month ago and was a second year student at the dental school at the University of North Carolina.

The last picture on his Facebook page, posted on January 29, said he helped provide free dental supplies to 75 homeless people in downtown Durham.  

The couple had organized an online fundraiser to get dental care to refugees from Syria, raising around $15,000 - but after news of their deaths, the total reached more than $23,000  

Mr Barakat was due to travel to Turkey in the summer to treat children who have become refugees following the civil war. 

Last month, he tweeted: 'It's so freaking sad to hear people saying we should 'kill Jews' or 'Kill Palestinians'. As if that's going to solve anything SMH [shaking my head].'  

His sister-in-law Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had been studying for a degree at North Carolina State University in Architecture and Environmental Design. 

After their deaths, Barakat's brother Farris paid tribute to the trio on Facebook as he struggled to comprehend the killings. 

'It doesn't make sense,' he wrote, 'and for that I rely on the Most Wise. It hurts and for that I know that God will not burden me more than I can handle.'

'I know my brother, his wife, and his sister in law are together as ultimate winners. This life was only ever a test and they have passed with flying colors...'

'I haven't even begun to fully comprehend what has happened. But I know for sure those three together have done so much we are all proud of. No reason to stop being proud now.' 

He added: 'We live as Muslims to die as Muslims. May Allah enter them to the highest of paradise.'
