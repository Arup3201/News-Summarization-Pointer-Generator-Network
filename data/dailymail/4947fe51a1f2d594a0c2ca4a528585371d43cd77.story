Murder: Veronica Rivas, 28, from San Diego allegedly admitted to  murdering her 22-month-old son to police

A mother has admitted drowning her toddler after suffering from depression, according to police.

Veronica Rivas, 28, from San Diego was arrested  on Friday and allegedly admitted to police that she murdered her 22-month-old son Elijah.

Officers were called to Rivas' condo on Woodpark Way Wednesday night at 7.45 p.m when the child's grandmother called 911 according to NBC 7 San Diego.

They immediately began CPR on Elijah until paramedics arrived. But they were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead at the scene.

Rivas was discovered unconscious in a room downstairs and was rushed to Tri City Medical Center.

She was treated for an emergency, thought to be an attempted suicide according to neighbors, but this has not been confirmed by police.

Detectives arrested Rivas at the hospital on Friday and transferred her to the Oceanside Police Department.

She has been booked into the Vista Detention Center on a first-degree murder charge.

Neighbor Colleen Land said: ‘I wish the mother would have asked for help. Or even if she needed it let her child be taken care of by someone else who loved him at that time before any tragedy would [have] happened.’

Concerned neighbors set up a makeshift shrine with a yellow teddy bear and a bouquet of flowers outside the family's home.

Three candles were lit throughout the night.

According to the child’s nanny, who was not named, Rivas had been going through a custody battle with the boy's father, a Marine, for the past two months. 

She told NBC 7 that she often saw Rivas crying and she seemed depressed.

She visited Rivas in the hospital Friday talking with her for less than a minute.
