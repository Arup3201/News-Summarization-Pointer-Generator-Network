The vandalism of a Ukrainian church in Sydney's west with swastikas and racial slurs has been labelled 'heinous' and 'disgusting'.

Members of the Ukrainian community - including children attending Saturday morning school - found Lidcombe's St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church and cars in its parking lot covered in blue and yellow spray paint.

Swastika symbols and slogans reading 'traitors and facists', 'Burn in hell for Bandera' and 'Burn in hell for the Sins of Poroshenko' were sprayed on the building.

Stepan Bandera was a former leader of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, which fought both Nazi Germany and Soviet forces during World War II, and Petro Poroshenko is the democratically elected President of Ukraine.

The Ukraininan community is in uproar after a catholic church in Sydney's west was vandalised

On Saturday, the Ukrainian community found their church in Lidcombe vandalised with swastikas and racial slurs

Father Simon Ckuj told Channel Nine News the act had left him 'sick in the gut'.

'The church is a sacred place - a place of peace and of love,' he said.

'Also to the elderly community who survived the Second World War, to see swastikas painted on the church, will be a most devastating thing.'

St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church was built 50 years ago by the Ukrainian community after they emigrated over to Australia after World War II. It was dedicated to those who were died during the war,

'Our church is actually a memorial church and in part commemorates Ukrainians who fought against Nazism in World War II,' Father Ckuj said.

'This act completely defiles the memory of those who died fighting fascism.'

It is thought the graffiti was done between midnight and 7am on Saturday

Ukrainian leaders - Father Simon Ckuj (left) and Peter Schmigel (right) of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations - have condemned the act

Despite the terrible act, Father Skuj said the church would pray for the offenders on Sunday morning during liturgy and ask God to forgive them.

Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations' Peter Shmigel has called on officials to condemn the actions of perpetrators.

'The Ukrainian Australian community has alerted the NSW Police, the Commonwealth Government and the NSW Government about this disgusting and worrisome incident, and we ask them to act decisively in the interest of public safety and community harmony,' he said.

Not even cars at St Andrew's Ukrainian Catholic Church were exempt from being emblazoned with swastikas

Some of the slogans read 'traitors and facists', 'Burn in hell for Bandera' and 'Burn in hell for the Sins of Poroshenko'

'This act completely trashes the principles of multicultural and democratic Australia, where we should always seek to live in a harmonious manner that respects all cultures and religions.

'There is no room for people – like those who attacked our church – to import their foreign conflicts to Australia and Sydney, where our community has made a positive contribution for 65 years.'

Communities and Citizenship Minister Victor Dominello said the act was completely unacceptable.

'To use an international racial dispute to vilify a community in Sydney is abhorrent,' he told AAP.

'The use of swastikas as a means of denigrating and attacking any community in NSW is utterly offensive.'
