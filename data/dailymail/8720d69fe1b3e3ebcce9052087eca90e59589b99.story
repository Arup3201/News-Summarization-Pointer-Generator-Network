A woman who didn't even know she was pregnant until her third trimester gave birth to a 14-pound baby boy on January 29.

Maxxandra's Ford's baby Avery Denton is the largest baby to ever be born at St. Joseph’s Women's Hospital in Tampa and is one of the largest babies ever to be born in Florida.

WFLA.com reports that Maxxandra Ford was putting on the pounds last fall and went to the doctor because she thought she may have some kind of medical issue.

Big welcome: Maxxandra Ford gave birth to Avery Denton weighing 14-lb, the heaviest baby born at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa Bay

Had no idea she was pregnant: Maxxandra Ford went to the doctor during her third trimester because she was putting on a  lot of weight and doctors told her she was 35 weeks pregnant

Baby fat: The average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces which is half the size of 14lb baby Avery 

The doctor told her she was 35 weeks pregnant and that she had just a few weeks to prepare for her new family member.

Ford grew quite large during her pregnancy and thought she may be carrying twins because she was a twin herself.

When Ford gave birth naturally to her 14.1 pound baby boy she realized she did not have twins just an abnormally large baby the size of two average babies.

Ford also has a one-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter at home.

Most large babies are delivered by cesarean section in the United States because large babies can cause complications during childbirth for both the baby and the mother.

Pediatrics expert Dr. Vincent Lannelli told The New York Daily News that the average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces.

Big surprise: Maxxandra Ford thought she might be giving birth to twins because she put on so much weight during her pregnancy but she naturally gave birth to just one huge 14lb baby boy 

Hungry?: Avery is an abnormally large baby and while he is healthy, his mother will need to monitor his diet to prevent him from becoming obese later in life 

Big plan: Maxxandra Ford thought she was merely gaining lots of weight but when a doctor told her she was pregnant she welcomed her new baby boy with loving arms 

Babies that weigh over 8 pounds and 8 ounces are considered to be on the heavier end of the spectrum.

14 pounds is certainly a lot of weight for a baby, but nothing tops the Guinness World Record's biggest birth of 22 pounds 8 oz. in South Africa. 

Christina Samane gave birth to the large child with Weaver's Syndrome, a disease that causes excessive growth in children due to genetic abnormalities.

Evidencebasedbirth.com reports that having an abnormally large baby may be linked to a mother's high blood sugar if not a genetic disorder. Around 1 in 10 women in the U.S. will have a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds.

Avery is currently healthy but his mother will have to monitor his diet if she doesn't want to risk the child becoming obese later in life.

New family member: in addition to newborn baby Avery Maxxandra Ford has a one-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter at home

Hey baby: Avery is a welcome addition to the Ford family where he is considered the biggest, smallest member
