A conservative Christian and mother of three from West Virginia has provoked vitriol from the left and support from the right after sharing her extreme beliefs about guns, abortion, health care and other political hot issues.

Holly Fisher, who Tweets using the provocative handle Holly Hobby Lobby, has created uproar online in the wake of last week’s controversial birth control decision by the Supreme Court.

To celebrate the court’s decision, Fisher posted a provocative photo online of her wearing a pro-life T-shirt, while posing in front of a Hobby Lobby store and holding a Chick-fil-A drinking cup.

Look away liberals! To celebrate the Supreme Court's controversial birth control decision, Holly Fisher posted a photo of her wearing a pro-life T-shirt, while posing in front of a Hobby Lobby store and holding a Chick-fil-A drinking cup

‘Attention Liberals: do not look at this picture. Your head will most likely explode,’ read the caption on the photo posted on July 1.

The image went viral, prompting opponents of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Hobby Lobby case to post offensive responses and even make threats against Fisher.

'Isn't it funny that the people who call me fat, ugly, a whore, stupid ...  a bitch, etc. are the same ones whining about the #WarOnWomen?' she tweeted.

Not content with the reaction she had generated, Fisher next posted a photo showing her standing in front of the American flag holding a gun and a copy of the Holy Bible on July 4.

Fisher's photo was quickly turned into a Twitter meme in which she was called the American Taliban and likened to the international terrorist known as the White Widow

‘Biggest complaint I'm getting about my #HobbyLobby pic is there's no gun, bible, or flag. Tried to make up for it,’ she tweeted.

Once again the image generated a lot of online heat and was also quickly turned into a Twitter meme, with many calling her the American Taliban.

In the meme, Fisher's photo is side-by-side with an image of Sherafiyah Lewthwaite, an international terrorist known as the White Widow who is part of the Al-Shabaab Islamic militant group.

The meme, which shows Lewthwaite in a similar stance while holding a gun and a copy of the Quran, says: 'Explain the difference.'

'My new nickname is "American Taliban" it seems. You know how I know the lefties don't really think I'm a terrorist? They hate me,' Fisher wrote on Monday in response to the backlash.

Fisher is a mother of three children and her husband David, right, is a military combat veteran

In other tweets, Fisher wrote to her 35,000 plus followers: 'Jihad Barbie. That means they think I'm pretty, right?' and, 'I'm not a terrorist, but my husband has killed a few. #ftw.'

The wife of a military combat vet, Fisher had previously stirred up controversy on social media when she claimed that Obamacare had caused her family to lose access to her baby’s pediatric cardiologist.

'I have always been extremely conservative and passionate about my views. The last few years of the growing hate and intolerance among the ‘tolerant’ left has made me want to stand up and speak out. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to show where I stand,' she told Liberty News.

I didn’t do it to try to change minds of those who disagree with me, but more so to show like-minded people that they’re not alone and it’s okay to stand up for what you believe in, even if it’s not popular right now. I want younger Americans to know it’s okay to not follow the current liberal path.'
