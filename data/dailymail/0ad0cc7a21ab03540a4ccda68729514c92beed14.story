For just under $200 mothers can now get 3-D 'keepsake ultrasounds' of their unborn children but the FDA warns that they should avoid the potentially harmful scans.

A Consumer Update revised by the FDA on Tuesday said that the tests should be used for medical reasons only and only be performed by licensed staff.

Ultrasounds are used to help doctors determine the health, size, and age of the child and can detect birth defects.

New trend: While 3-D images of a mother's unborn child may bring her delight it may also harm the baby

While there is no proof that ultrasounds are harmful to the baby, it heats the baby's tissues slightly and can also cause small bubbles in tissue.

'Although there is a lack of evidence of any harm due to ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitors, prudent use of these devices by trained health care providers is important,' says Shahram Vaezy, Ph.D., an FDA biomedical engineer in the update.

'Ultrasound can heat tissues slightly, and in some cases, it can also produce very small bubbles (cavitation) in some tissues,' she adds.

Doctors don't yet know the long term effects of these scans on the child and fear that non-medical imaging centers aimed at giving mothers photos and videos for sentimental reasons do not take the baby's health into consideration.

The FDA says that at such places the fetus could be exposed to up to an hour of ultrasound technology which is longer than most doctors spend.

Mothers are seeking out the unnecessary medical to get renderings of their child so they can share them on social media or feel an emotional connection to their child.

CBS spoke with Donquesha Williams, 26, who had an ultrasound done at Meet Your Baby in the Lakewood Center Mall in Southern California.

'These are going to go in my photo album. I get to actually see him... so I'm excited and everything,' Williams said.

'We use the same machine as the doctor,' owner Michael Horan said.

'Our techs spend a little more time to get a more enjoyable session out of it.'

Popular imaging: Evelyn Orozco (pictured) who owns 3-D Imaging Services in New York City said that 3-D ultrasounds are one of her biggest sellers but says she is not a doctor and cannot give medical advice 

Mother Felicia said that while she enjoyed seeing a 2-D image of her child during a medical ultrasound, she was overcome with emotion when she saw the 3-D image.

'I felt emotionally connected in the 2-D, but I almost cried here,' she said.

Evelyn Orozco who owns 3-D Imaging Services in New York City said that 3-D ultrasounds are one of her biggest sellers.

'All of a sudden, it's not a black and white: you see the features, you see a baby's face and the biggest thing here is the nose,' Orozco said.

'Everybody talks about the nose. "Whose nose is that? Is it daddy's nose? Is it mommy's nose?"'

Orozco says that she requires all the expectant mothers who come to her to be under the care of an OBGYN.

'Again, I'm not a doctor. The biggest thing I tell everybody is just make sure you drink plenty of water‘, she said.

She says that while patients ask her advice on images sometimes she is sure not to overstep her boundaries.

The state of Connecticut has already banned prenatal ultrasounds for non-medical use.
