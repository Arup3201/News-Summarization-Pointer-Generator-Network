Favourite night out: Prince Harry leaving Tonteria

It used to be Boujis. Then it was Mahiki. But now Prince Harry has a new playground – a Mexican-themed nightclub which hosts some of the wildest nights in London.

The club, called Tonteria, regularly features dancers dressed in bondage-style lingerie. A bottle of tequila costs £5,000 – and VIP clients can have their drinks delivered to their table by toy train.

Such is the 29-year-old Prince’s fondness for the place, earlier this month he was there on a Monday, Thursday and Saturday, three nights out of the four that the club is open.

Arrangements have been made to try to ensure Harry is never photographed arriving, leaving, or at the club. Non-VIP visitors must obey a ‘selfies-only’ rule to protect him and other high-profile revellers from unwanted attention. It is a rule that is strictly enforced.

On July 12, at a World Cup party, the club’s co-owner, Marc Burton, snatched phones from two excitable young Chelsea girls who had dared to point them in the direction of Harry as he breezed past them to join his entourage of friends in the tiny VIP room.

The girls ended up in tears and eventually their phones were returned, but only after the blurry photos were deleted.

A discreet side entrance takes Harry from the Sloane Square Hotel next door directly into the club’s VIP area, so he never has to walk past paparazzi. He even has use of a private marble bathroom.

On the Thursday night, Harry would have witnessed the club’s famously bacchanalian Do Not Disturb party, when dancers dressed in latex lingerie weave between flame throwers and customers, who are encouraged to interact.

On Mondays, Mexican wrestlers tussle with each other, and also perform for guests queuing up outside in Chelsea’s Sloane Square.

Harry is often seen drinking shots with the barmen while topless men wearing giant skulls on their heads patrol the club with sparklers.

Prince William visited the club last year, and the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have also been spotted there.

Other celebrities seen enjoying the club’s attractions include model Cara Delevingne, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake and singer Jessie J – and Harry’s former girlfriend Cressida Bonas.

Once inside, thirsty guests can choose from the club’s cocktail menu. If they choose a bottle of Reserva Del Alma from the Tonteria Ultimate Tequila list, it will set them back £5,000.

One of the club’s large bottles of champagne is priced at £28,000.

The club’s signature drinks are frozen margaritas served in vessels shaped like Mayan pyramids and Day of the Dead skulls. 

Those who don’t want to battle through the throng for their drinks can have the club’s most expensive tequilas delivered to private tables on an electronic train called the Jose Cuervo Express.

On the same night that the girls had their phones confiscated, it was reported that Harry was spotted ‘in a clinch’ with Camilla Thurlow, a former Miss Edinburgh. The pretty 25-year-old works for the Halo Trust, a landmine charity made famous by Harry’s mother Princess Diana.

She was famously photographed visiting a minefield in Angola which Halo workers were helping to clear.

Shortly before Harry and Camilla were seen enjoying a kiss, the Prince had been seen chasing the young charity worker around the VIP area brandishing an inflatable medal.

The tiny VIP room used by Harry has a special black curtain that is sometimes closed to stop drunken revellers from peeking in and causing a nuisance, although Harry rarely asks for it to be drawn.

One regular at the club told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘If it was up to him, he wouldn’t even be in the VIP room. He’s very casual.’

The Mexican theme extends to the club’s decoration, with walls covered in colourful graffiti.

One sign reads, ‘Tequila is a sneaky BITCH. One minute you are SEXY dancing, the next you are on the floor, PANTLESS making out with a SHOE – Tonteria.’

A popular saying on the club’s Twitter account is, ‘One shot, two shot, three shot, floor!”

A source said of the nightclub: ‘Tonteria tends to be a pretty wild night out and can often get quite out of hand. But the staff there recognise the need for discretion and confidentiality when it comes to the club’s VIP guests.

‘Quite often Prince Harry can spend the whole night at the club without anyone knowing he is there. The VIP area is tightly guarded and guests are given complete privacy.

‘It makes it much easier for celebrities to enjoy themselves, knowing that they won’t be photographed and gawped at.’

Food at Tonteria includes Mexican delicacies such as nachos, quesadillas, burritos and fajitas. They are served during a ‘pre-dinner’ sitting, after which the lights are dimmed and the restaurant tables are removed in order to create space on the dance floor.

It’s no surprise that the bizarre club – which translates as ‘folly, foolery, nonsense or silliness’ in Spanish – is the brainchild of Harry’s best friend, nightclub entrepreneur Guy Pelly.

He decided to open it after his last Chelsea venture, a club called Public, closed down in 2012.

He had spent a year battling with authorities to keep it open after it was branded a public nuisance and ‘number one crime generator’. Last week, Pelly, 32, received his third drink-driving ban.

He had been stopped by police after leaving Tonteria in his £90,000 Audi R8 GTV10 Coupe.

He was banned for two-and-a-half years and ordered to pay £7,120 in costs and fines.

In September last year, a video created by Pelly and his Tonteria colleagues advertising their Do Not Disturb club night had to be removed from YouTube after violating the website’s explicit content regulations. Pelly did not appear in the film but was credited as its director.

The offending video, which starred up-and-coming British model Jake Hold, featured several scenes of nudity, sexual activity, bondage, sadism and masochism.

A Tonteria spokesman insisted at the time that it was ‘all in good fun’.
