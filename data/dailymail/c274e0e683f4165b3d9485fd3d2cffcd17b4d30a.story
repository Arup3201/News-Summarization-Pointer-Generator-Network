A mum-of-four was burned to death after her boyfriend discovered she'd been having an affair with his 18-year-old son, a court heard.

Ashley Williams, 49, put tape over the mouth of his  24-year-old girlfriend Julie Beattie and hit her with a hammer before dousing her in petrol, the Old Bailey was told.

Miss Beattie staggered out of their house in Walworth, south London, shrouded in flames and later died from 90 per cent burns, the jury were told.

The court heard Julie Beattie, left, was planning to move in with Ashley Williams Jnr, right, on the day she died

Jurors heard that Miss Beattie had told father-of-12 Williams she was leaving him for his 18-year-old son, Ashley Williams Jnr, before the attack.

Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: 'That was why the defendant carried out the dreadful act of revenge that he did.

'Julie Beattie died a terrible death. The medical staff at the burns unit did all they could but her injuries were such that she could not be saved.'

She died of her injuries in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. The court heard her last words were: 'Ashley did this to me.'

Hours before the alleged attack, Miss Beattie’s sister Lucy had gone to help Miss Beattie collect her belongings and move in with her new lover, Ashley Jnr, the court heard.

But Williams, who was suspicious of Miss Beattie, returned home early from his work as an Islington Council groundsman to tried and stop her.

Lucy Beattie said she left to give the troubled couple space but, when she came back, she saw her sister stumble out of the house in flames, the court heard.

Ashley Williams Jnr, who was Williams' son from a previous marriage, attended his father's murder trial at the Old Bailey today

Prosecutor Mr Brown said: 'The fire that killed her was deliberately set by this defendant.

'He used petrol that was likely to have been mixed with diesel. The liquid must have been on her when it was ignited.

'Her other injuries were to the top of her head. He had hit her with a hammer.

'That did not kill her. It was the flames that killed her, but that combination of injuries tells you much of the defendant’s actions in those dreadful moments.'

The court heard Ashley Williams Jnr, pictured, and Miss Beattie started a relationship after he moved in with her and his father

The court heard Williams had eight children with a previous wife, including Ashley Jnr.

He then started seeing Miss Beattie’s mum Linda, who had three children, including Julie, from a previous relationship.

When that relationship broke down, Williams began seeing Miss Beattie, who he went on to have four young children with, the first being born when she was just 16.

Jurors heard things began to deteriorate between the couple when Williams’ son Ashley Jnr moved in with them in September 2012.

Miss Beattie and Ashley Jnr started a sexual relationship and on the day of Miss Beattie's death, the pair were planning to set up home together in Catford, south east London, the court heard.

Prosecutor Mr Brown said Williams, who did nothing to try and help Miss Beattie, was arrested in a park shortly after the attack.

He had slit his wrists and police were alerted to him after following a trail of blood from the house, the court heard.

Weeks before the attack he had tried to take an overdose of pills, jurors were told.

Mr Brown said that when police approached him he said: 'I am the man you are looking for'.

Mr Brown added: 'The cause of this lady's terrible death was this defendant's deliberate act. He was angry, aggressive and seeking revenge for what he considered she had done to him.

'She was beaten by him with a hammer to the top of her head, no doubt when standing over her and then set light to her.

'There can have been no other intention for what he did so but to cause her at least really serious harm or indeed death.'

Williams, of Walworth, south east London, denies murder. The trial continues.
