The husband of 'baby killer' Megan Huntsman has undergone a DNA test to see if he is the father of the seven victims.

Darren West voluntarily gave police a sample of his DNA to allow forensic scientist to confirm if he is the father.

His wife, who is being held on a $6 million bond, has told police all seven babies were conceived while she was still married to the 41-year-old construction worker.

Mail Online has revealed that she was thrown out of her home by in-laws after she began an affair with a co-worker when Darren was jailed for nine years on drugs offenses.

Darren has denied any knowledge of his wife's claim that she strangled or suffocated six of the babies soon after birth.

The 39-year old-Huntsman, who has three daughters aged from 13to 21, said the seventh was stillborn.

Pleasant Grove Police chief Michael Smith told Mail Online West had voluntarily submitted to a DNA test.

He refused to speculate on the sex of the seven victims and said test results should be back in the next couple of days.

He said: 'Mr West has been fully cooperative . He has had a DNA test which will help in determining the paternity of the seven babies. We are just waiting on the results from the medical examiner.'

Huntsman, who is on suicide watch at the Utah State jail, has claimed she gave birth to seven children between 1996 and 2006.

Police chief Smith said they had all but ruled out that the babies, who were found wrapped in blankets and in boxes in Hunstsman's home, were anyone's but hers.

'The DNA test will tell us everything,' he said.

Smith said detectives had interviewed Hunstsman's three daughters who have said they had no knowledge of the pregnancies.

'There is nothing to suggest they were involved,' said Smith.

Hunstsman was arrested on Saturday at the home she shared with her boyfriend Jimmy Brady.

Neighbours at the mobile home where they had lived for the past 18 months said Hunstsman had a miscarriage last year.

Josh Flower, who lives next door to Huntsman, said she always seemed to adore children.

'She would always offer her services to babysit. She really did like being around children and had such a good way with them,' said Flowers.

'That is what makes this so hard to understand.

'How can someone who says she loves looking after children be the same person who then apparently suffocates seven of her own babies.

'It just does not make any sense.'

Flowers, 34, said more than 20 police officers and forensic teams had descended on Hunstsman's home at the weekend.

He said Jimmy Brady was attending his mother's funeral and returned home to find their home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City surrounded by police.

'It was just unreal. They said they were here to look for more evidence, I guess to see if any babies were buried here,' said Flowers.

'They were here a few hours and then left without finding anything.'

Flowers, a father of three, said last year Huntsman returned from hospital having suffered a miscarriage.

'She was upset about that,' he said.
