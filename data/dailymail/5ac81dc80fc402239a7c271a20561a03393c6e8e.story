A woman has given a new meaning to the phrase 'hair raising' thanks to her ability to hang from the ceiling by only her, yes you guessed it - hair.

Anastasia IV, real name Joanna Sawicka, is the only person in the UK to practice the ancient art of hair hanging and makes a living from her strong locks.

She even holds the Guinness world record for lifting the heaviest weight with her hair but needs 2 bottles a day of conditioner to keep her super-strong barnet in tip-top condition. She even has it insured for £1m.

Now THAT's hair raising! Anastasia IV, 26, from Poland, is the only person in the UK to practice the ancient art of hair hanging and holds the Guinness world record for lifting the heaviest with her hair

Her unique talent emerged when she decided to give up studying biochemistry in London and join a circus show.

Anastasia, 26, said: 'The idea of running away to the circus was romantic. I had no idea I would end up doing something so crazy. But I've found my calling and it feels fantastic!'

Although she originally came to the UK from Poland to study, when she met her then-boyfriend now husband, also a circus performer known as Hannibal Hellmurto, in a North London pub she gave it up to join him.

It wasn't long before Anastasia was lying on beds of nails and sword swallowing but within two years she was looking to find her own niche act and chanced upon the ancient act of hair hanging.

Thought to be a tradition practised by Chinese men, the art of hair hanging was almost forgotten before Anastasia started her training. 

Ouch! In the circus world, the skill is confined to families who pass their secrets about the tradition down through generations and it's a rather painful skill

Mad skills: Anastasia even managed to pull a 2.5 ton car 20 metres down London's Shaftesbury Avenue using her hair - but needs 2 bottles a day of conditioner to keep her super-strong hair in tip-top condition

Wow! Her husband and two helpers have to plait her wet hair in a specific style to make sure that her weight is distributed equally

It took months of effort for her to manage to hang from her hair and much like the training of an elite athlete, it often brought her to tears.

Since then, she has spent four years perfecting her act and now when she's performing for captivated audiences all over the country she can spin so fast her face becomes a blur, all while hanging by the strands on top of her head.

She even managed to pull a 2.5 ton car 20 metres down London's Shaftesbury Avenue using her hair.

In preparation for performances with the Circus of Horrors, her acrobat team, she undergoes a lengthy hair care regime lasting an hour and a half.

Her mane needs to be brushed thoroughly as any knots or tangles could weaken the rope-like structure her hair becomes.

Her husband and two helpers have to plait her wet hair in a specific style to make sure that her weight is distributed equally and the strength of each hair, which can hold up to 100g, is being made the most of.

Preparation is key: Her mane needs to be brushed thoroughly as any knots or tangles could weaken the rope-like structure her hair becomes - and she conditions it up for 6 times per day

Remember us? Anastasia, cente, and fellow acrobats, The Circus of Horrors, made it to the semi-final of Britain's Got Talent in 2011

During a tour, Anastasia has to condition her hair five times a day: like most people first thing in the morning, then once in the middle of the day and then another bout just before she starts a show.

As soon as she finishes a performance she reconditions, leaving it to soak in for an hour, and then it's the last thing she does before she goes to bed.

Anastasia said: 'To be suspended by your hair feels exactly how it looks. It is definitely not a pleasant act to learn and can be painful at times.

'But I've been doing it for four years now and it feels more like a sensation now rather than pain.

'The first few times I tried hair hanging it was quite scary but it also felt fantastic. It is the closest a person can get to actually flying as you are lifted by your head.

'Unlike in other more classical aerial acts your hands and feet are absolutely free and you are not holding on to anything. It's exciting.

'It's also really special. Hair hanging is not something you can learn in any circus school - the secrets of plaiting the hair are passed down generation to generation.

'Thankfully I don't have any split ends!'

Hair hanging is when a performer is suspended by their hair and performs acrobatic poses

Rumour has it that it originated in South America or China

A single strand of hair can carry up to 100 grams

In the circus world, the skill is confined to families who pass their secrets about the tradition down through generations

The hair must be tied to the rig so that the weight of what they're carrying is evenly distributed
