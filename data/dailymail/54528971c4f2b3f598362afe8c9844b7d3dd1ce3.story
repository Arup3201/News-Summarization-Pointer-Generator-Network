With its distinctive logo, endless merchandise and famous mansion in LA, it is almost impossible to remember a time when Playboy didn't exist.

In fact it is almost exactly sixty years since a man by the name of Hugh Hefner quit his job at Esquire magazine after being denied a $5 pay rise and set about creating a world publishing icon on his kitchen table in Chicago.

Yesterday in LA that magazine celebrated its 60th anniversary with 60 bunnies touring around the city in an open topped bus with the ageing Hefner, now 87, posing for pictures with them.

Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy , has celebrated the magazine's 60th anniversary with 60 of his bunnies in Los Angeles, California

In 1953 the publication launched its first issue which sold 53,000 copies, becoming an instant hit. By 1966 (pictured) Hefner had gained both fame and notoriety

The 60th anniversary issue of the magazine, published last month, featured Kate Moss on the cover

Hefner, now 87, founded the magazine with $600 of his own money and $8,000 from 45 other investors - including $1,000 from his own mother

In the glorious Californian sunshine the bunnies, which included Hefner's daughter Christie, and several former Playmates Of The Year, celebrated the special event at Playboy World Headquarters.

Speaking at the launch of the 60th anniversary magazine, which featured Kate Moss on the front cover, Hefner said: 'Sixty years ago, I created Playboy magazine with an intent to reflect on and influence the cultural changes taking place in America, as well as to become the voice of sophisticated men all over the world.

'From its beginning, Playboy has stood for freedom of speech, freedom of choice and freedom of the press.Â 

'I am so proud to celebrate this anniversary as the magazine continues its mission to promote these core values many decades later.'

In 1953, aged in his mid-20s, Hefner used $600 of his own money, and another $8,000 from 45 investors - including $1,000 from his mother - to publish the first edition of Playboy.

It appeared on December 1 1953, cost 50 cent, featured a black and white picture of a fully dressed Marilyn Monroe on the cover and promised full colour nude pictures inside. It sold 53,000 copies, becoming an instant hit.

The 60 bunnies toured on an open top bus through LA's Beverley Hills neighbourhood as part of the magazine's year-long 60th anniversary celebrations

When the magazine launched it cost 50 cents and featured a black and white photo of a fully-dressed Marilyn Monroe on the front - with the promise of nude color pictures inside

The magazine, which has been in decline for several years, enjoyed its peak circulation in the 1970s, selling 7milliion copies every month

Two years later, in 1955, the magazine featured the first bikini shot on its front page, as playmate of the month Janet Pilgrim posed face-down on a towel on the front.

The magazine has always courted controversy, from modern-day campaigns against presenting women as sexual objects, to a court case in 1963 during which Hefner was accused of publishing obscene material.

He stood in his own defence, arguing that the difference between art and pornography was an issue for individual taste and not the courts. The jury came back with a split verdict, and the case was thrown as a mistrial.

During the case Hefner stood in his own defence, and eventually the case was thrown out as a mistrial after he argued that the difference between obscenity and art was a matter for individual taste

Staying ahead of the curve of public opinion, in 1971 the magazine was the first to feature a picture of African-American model Darine Stern on its front page

During the 80s the mansion got its reputation for allegedly hosting wild parties and orgies, fuelled by alcohol, cannabis and cocaine.

Meanwhile the influence of the magazine continued to grow under the guise of female empowerment and fighting for minority rights. In 1971 Darine Stern became the first African-American to feature on the cover and nude inside.

In 1985, at the height of the magazine's notoriety, Hefner suffered a minor stroke, causing him to reevaluate his lifestyle, handing over the reins of the mansion to his daughter, Christie, and in 1989 he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad with whom he had two children.

Hefner purchased the infamous Playboy Mansion in 1971 which allegedly played host to drug and sex fuelled orgies well into the 1980s

But in 1985 Hefner suffered a minor stroke and handed over the reins of the palace to his daughter Christie

While the magazine campaigned for years on women's rights and sexual liberation, modern-day feminists have bitterly criticised it for objectifying women

Since then the Playboy empire has slowly declined as magazine sales have dropped off and audiences have complained that its image is outdated and demeaning to women.

The 60th anniversary issue, which featured Moss dressed in the iconic tuxedo collar, cuffs, bunny ears and leotard on the front - and posed on all fours inside - provoked the ire of many feminist commentators.

On the same day as the bus tour it was announced that former Miss February 2006 - Cassandra Lynn Hensley - had been found dead in her friend's bathtub of a suspected drug overdose.
