Efrion Conales was missing for more than two weeks until a local news report helped reunite him with his family

Robert Ortiz, of the Bronx, connected the dots between a missing poster he saw in his neighborhood and a picture of the hospitalized man posted to a television station's Facebook page and called the phone number on the missing poster.

The station initially reported the man was found Oct 29 unconscious on a D train platform in the Bronx before being brought to a local hospital.

On life support: Efrion Conales was missing for more than two weeks until a local news report helped reunite him with his family

WPIX posted the report to its Facebook page on November 16. The missing posters were up in the Bronx neighborhood shortly after Mr Conales went missing Oct 28, the Daily News reported.

‘My dad has been missing since 10/28/13. If anyone has any info please contact [a mobile number]. His name is Efrion Conales also known as Frayo,’ the poster read.

It didn’t take long after Mr Ortiz saw the poster in his neighborhood and shared it online until he made the connection, the station reported Saturday.

‘There's a man that's been missing in my neighborhood since 10/28 and it looks like his guy,’ Mr Ortiz commented on WPIX’s Facebook page on Nov 16. ‘I called the number on the missing flyer and spoke to his daughter.’

This poster: Mr Ortiz posted this picture of this poster to his personal Facebook page and was able to connect it to the WPIX report within a few days

‘I sent her the picture and she called me back saying it's her father. She's on her way to the hospital now.’

The daughter later called Mr Ortiz to confirm it was indeed her father, he wrote on the Facebook page.

‘My joy comes from the fact that his family was able to connect with him,’ Mr Ortiz later wrote, ‘All I did was pay a little more attention to my environment.’

Multiple family members posted messages of thanks to both Mr Ortiz and the station.

One comment likely echoed the thoughts of many of Frayo’s family and friends.

‘We all have plenty of unanswered questions but right now our focus is on him making a full recovery.’

Mr Conales remains hospitalized in critical condition, WPIX noted, adding that he at least is now surrounded by his family.
