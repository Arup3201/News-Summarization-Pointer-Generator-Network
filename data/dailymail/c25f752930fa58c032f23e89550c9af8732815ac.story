The grieving families of the victims of the Washington mudslide need government funds to pay for funerals for their loved ones, Governor Jay Inslee said on Monday as he petitioned President Obama for more disaster relief.

The deadly mudslide that swept way a rural community in Oso on March 22 - killing at least 24 people and destroying 30 homes - caused $10million in damage, the governor reported.

President Obama previously declared the mudslide a federal emergency, but Inslee is now hoping to secure a major disaster declaration which will grant financial assistance to the community displaced by the natural disaster.

Inslee says 30 families need assistance with housing, personal and household goods after the slide destroyed $7million in structures and another $3million in contents. 

The request also seeks federal help to cover funeral expenses and mental health care programs for survivors, volunteers, community members and first responders on the scene.

Meanwhile rescue teams, including 
National Guard units back from Afghanistan, went into their ninth day 
searching for remains in the half-square mile of muck.

The remains of three bodies were 
pulled from the mud on Monday, but they haven't been added to the death 
toll yet as the medical examiner tries to identify the remains.

Wading through the mud: Monday was dry and sunny which aided in the search. Remains of three bodies were pulled from the muck yesterday but haven't been added to the official death toll yet

The death toll raised to 24 yesterday, up from 21 the day before. So far, 18 of the 24 remains have been identified by the medical examiners. Meanwhile, the list of missing has been narrowed down to 22 from 30.

'There's been an exhaustive effort by the detectives to narrow the list down to one that they feel comfortable releasing,' Snohomish county executive director Gary Haakenson said.

'These are 22 people whose loved ones
 are grieving,' he said. 'We want to do all we can to find them and put 
some closure in place for their families.'

Complicating the process is the fact the bodies aren't always found in tact.

Recovery team supervisor Steve Harris 
said the force of the landslide was so strong that whole cars were 
'compacted down to about the size of a refrigerator, just smashed to the
 point where you can hardly tell it was a vehicle.'

Protection: Rescuers have been duct-taping their boots to their trousers to stop contamination from the toxic waste mixed in with the mud

No one has been pulled out of the mud alive since the day of the slide, when eight injured were rescued from the mud.

Dog teams have been helping the rescuers but were given a break on Sunday due to exhaustion.

Authorities say it may be impossible to account for everyone lost in the disaster. 

The decision to call off the search will be made by the joint incident command but a spokesman for Gov Inslee says 'there's a lot of work to be done yet'.

But a sunny day Monday and forecasted dry whether should help the rescue process as teams can focus on searching instead of pumping water out of the mud field.

This drying trend 'will help crews and rescue the risk of flooding and additional slides,' the county said in a statement.

But even with the drying trend, officials are scared about the toxic contaminants that could spread disease into the local community.

Officials say that sewage, propane, household solvents and other chemicals are mixed in with the muck, and rescuers have been taping their boots to their trousers to ward off exposure.

'We're worried about dysentery. We're worried about tetanus. We're worried about contamination,' local fire Lieutenant Richard Burke, a spokesman for the operation, told reporters visiting the disaster site. 'The last thing we want to do is take any of these contaminants out of here and take them into town, back to our families.'

'This is going to be a hazardous materials site for many years while we try to get this cleaned up,' Burke said.

While rescuers continued to search through the mud on Monday for remains buried 60 to 80 feet below, some 300 gathered at the local Darrington Community Center to be cheered up with a visit from members of the Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks and the city's Major League Soccer team, the Sounders.

The athletes signed autographs, tossed footballs and kicked soccer balls with many children left homeless in the slides.

'To be able to offer a little bit of a release or a distraction from what's going on, I mean that's all you can do,' Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith said.

Ten-year-old Jacob Spelman got a bright green Seahawks hat autographed by a player and spoke to reporters after the visit.

'I just feel like they care and that they would like it if we felt better and they came to help us,' he said.
