A clinically obese, unfit 'film geek' has transformed himself into a toned Man of Steel thanks to a gruelling diet and exercise regime.

And he's documented his progress with an incredible time-lapse video which shows three and a half stone melting away and a body fit for a superhero (well, almost!) emerging.

Sam Ashurst, 35, says: 'Inspired by the release of the new Superman movie I thought it would be fun to try to emulate my favourite superhero by signing up to Barry's Bootcamp gym, to get my very own superbody.'

Over the course of the challenge, Sam
 lost 12.8% body fat, three and a half 
stone and 24 years from his metabolic age.

'When
 I started, I did have the metabolism of a 49 year old man - I'm 35 - so
 the whole thing has been fairly incredible,' explains Sam.

Sam blogged his progress on the Total Film website.

'Some of the blog followers even said they found it inspirational,' he says. 'And seeing as that's one of Superman's main powers - to inspire people to be better - I think I achieved my main goal.'

But it wasn't easy. Sam admits he was 'terrified at first.' His first gym visit was an eye opener: 'One dude was literally 7 foot tall, and he had the body of Brad Pitt in Fight Clubâ€¦ only buffer. Everyone looked like they'd been raised in a gym by Spartans.''I'd never 
been to a gym before, and I've seen enough gifs to assume I'd fall off 
the treadmill on the first try - but with the motivation of Barry's 
amazing trainers, I actually started to enjoy myself.
