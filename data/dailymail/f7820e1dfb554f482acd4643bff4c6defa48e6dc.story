While his namesake Cristiano Ronaldo was collecting a third Ballon d'Or on Monday, the original Brazilian Ronaldo was also a big winner... at a major poker event.

The World Cup winner, and former three time FIFA Player of the Year himself, collected $42,180 (£27,824) at the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) Main Event in the Bahamas.

The tournament, which is still under way in the Bahamas, will see the winner collect a top prize of more than $1.4 million (£923,000).

The World Cup winner moved into 26th place - further than any other sports star has ever reached

The former Inter Milan and Real Madrid star beat some of the world's top poker player on his way to cashing in - taking 26th place from a field of 816 players (top 4%).

'El Fenómeno' also beat former Pokerstars 'SportStar' Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia's previous record of 52nd place set in 2012, to go further than any other sports star in the PCA's 10-year history. 

Ronaldo said: 'I'm really excited, it's the same emotion I used to have at the soccer fields playing at the highest level. 

Ronaldo had previously lost a head to head with tennis superstar Rafael Nadal in 2014

'The experience has been great, my first goal was to get a prize in a big tournament and I achieved that.'

After losing to tennis superstar Rafa Nadal in a heads-up poker charity event in late 2014, Ronaldo was determined to improve his game and has obviously been spending time working on his strategy.

Support flooded in with celebrities - including Sergio Garcia – and sports fans alike, voicing their encouragement on Twitter with the hashtag #GoRonaldoPCA
