Manchester United defender Patrice Evra is on the brink of a permanent move to Italian side Juventus.

The Frenchman is prepared to accept a two year deal in the region of £55,000-a-week and the Italian club have made formal contact with United over a £2milion transfer.

Juventus are confident of concluding a deal in the next 48 hours after Evra asked the club to respect his decision to leave Old Trafford. His primary motivation is believed to be for family reasons, with his wife Sandra keen to live abroad.

Evra’s place in the United team has also been placed into jeopardy following the arrival of Luke Shaw from Southampton and Sportsmail revealed in June that the new £28m recruit has been assured that he will be the first-choice left-back at Old Trafford as the Louis van Gaal era dawns.

As United will not have European football this season, they will often be playing just one match a week, thus limiting the first-team opportunities available to Evra.

The full-back saw his contract extended for a further year at the end of the season but it now seems extremely like that he will begin next season wearing the black and white stripes of Juventus, where he will team up with French international team-mate and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.

United were reluctant to lose the experience and dressing room influence of Evra but will not stand in the way of a player who has provided almost a decade of sterling service with the club.

Senior officials were extremely 
impressed with Evra’s commitment and dedication to the United cause 
under David Moyes last season, especially after Moyes had launched a 
very public pursuit of Leighton Baines, and his departure will be met 
with sadness by many within the corridors of power at Old Trafford.

The French defender has spent eight trophy-laden years at Old Trafford, winning five Premier League trophies and appearing in three UEFA Champions League finals in his spell at Old Trafford, including the 2008 penalty shoot-out triumph over Chelsea in Moscow.

It marks the culmination of a mass exodus of senior stars from the United dressing room, after Ryan Giggs retired at the end of the season, while Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic both left at the end of their contracts.

Giggs has remained as Van Gaal’s assistant manager but the loss of experience on the playing side will be keenly felt, with the four players racking up an extraordinary 2097 United appearances and a combined 80 medals between them in their distinguished careers at Old Trafford.

Meanwhile, United remain keen on Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal but the Turin-based club want £37m for their Chile star.

Van Gaal is believed to be keen to sign the Chilean, who represented his country at the World Cup in Brazil.

United have made tentative enquiries as to Vidal's availability but they are currently miles away from Juve's valuation.
