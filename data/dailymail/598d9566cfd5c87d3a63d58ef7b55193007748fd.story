More than 100 mostly female students at a public high school on Staten Island were told they violated its dress code and -- in the words of one local media outlet -- were 'slut-shamed into covering up'.

Students at Tottenville High School who showed up for class on Friday without the proper attire were forced to to either cover up or wait in the sweltering auditorium on one of the hottest days of the year for their parents to arrive with the appropriate garb, according to the Staten Island Advance. 

Upset students took to Twitter and Facebook to vent their anger, and one parent whose three daughters were detained for wearing shorts said he was considering filing a class action lawsuit.

More than 100 students at Tottenville High School on Staten Island were told on Friday they violated its dress code and were required to cover up before they could attend class

The school's dress code prohibits tank tops, low-cut blouses, tubes/halter and midriff tops, short-shorts, mini-skirts, hooded sweatshirts, sweatpants, leggings, 'skinny jeans,' headbands, hats, bandanas, sunglasses and visible undergarments, according to the Staten Island Advance. 

Some students, such as sophomore Olivia Buonomo, were given grey Tottenville athletic T-shirts to wear.

She said 'it's not fair' that she was forced to wear the 'heavy' substitute for her much lighter tank top on such a hot day, the Advance reported.

Classmate Tiffani Cropley avoided being caught by carrying her bookbag in front of her as she walked to classes.

Freshman Gianna Savattiere said she wouldn't mind the dress code if the school was air-conditioned.

'The whole building is sweltering today,' she said.

Vincent Candellieri said he had to pick up his three daughters after they were detained for wearing shorts.

'I can understand where they're coming from, but this is outrageous,' he said, adding he is considering filing a lawsuit.

Interim principal Joseph Scarmato said he's simply attempting to enforce the school's existing rules and discipline code, which he argued is necessary to prepare the students for college and the workplace.
