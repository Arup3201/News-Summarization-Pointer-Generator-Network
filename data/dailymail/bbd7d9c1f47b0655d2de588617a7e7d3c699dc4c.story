A hero American diver who helped in the search for the body of a senior government minister killed in a plane crash in the Philippines last year has been murdered with a shotgun blast in the face.

Matthew Caldwell, 59, who had joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo was hit at point blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun, said Senior Superintendent Adolfo Samala of Las Pinas police.

Mr Caldwell, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage.

He was among the first to be called upon in August last year when a Piper Seneca plane carrying Mr Robredo crashed in the waters off Masbate.

Because of the great depth at which the aircraft was believed to be lying, Mr Caldwell's skills, along with those of two unidentified British divers, were required to search for the wreckage.

He had attended a meeting of the coast guard on Thursday night when shortly afterwards he became involved in an argument with a security guard as he and his live-in partner, Miss Jeanelyn Flora, 36, were heading to their home in Las Pinas, five miles south of Manila.

According to police the security guard, named as Ericson Elacquio, prevented Mr Caldwell from entering his road because he said the American had not paid monthly dues to the homeowners' association.

When the guard continued to refuse to raise a wooden beam blocking the road, Mr Caldwell got out of his Toyota Corolla and tried to raise the barrier himself.

It was then, as tempers flared, said Superintendent Samala, that the security guard raised his shotgun and fired it straight into Mr Caldwell's face, killing him instantly.

The guard and a companion commandeered a motor cycle and spend off into the night.

'We have launched a major search for him,' said Superintendent Samala. 'We are confident we will find him.'

As well as helping to locate the wreckage of the aircraft carrying Mr Robredo, Mr Caldwell had previously been involved in recovering bodies from a sunken wood-hulled passenger ship, the Catalyn B., which collied with a steel-hulled fishing vessel on Christmas Even, 2009.
