John Wayne Bobbitt - the American man who became a household name when his ex-wife used a carving knife to slice off his penis - has broken his neck in a car accident, it has been claimed.

Mr Bobbitt is understood to have been driving to his brother's house in Buffalo, New York on Tuesday when a driver jumped a red light and plowed into the 47-year-old's pick-up truck.

The former U.S. Marine achieved worldwide notoriety in 1993 when his then wife Lorena used an eight inch carving knife to cut off his penis as punishment for what she said were repeated beatings.

Although Mr Bobbitt suffered a broken vertebrae and slipped disc in his back during the crash, his injuries are not thought to be life threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery, TMZ said.

Mr Bobbitt found fame in 1993 when his abusive relationship with wife Lorena made international headlines after she used a large knife to cut off his penis.

He claims to been out drinking with friends in Virginia on the night of June 23, 1993, which led to the couple having a furious row when he got home. 

A court later heard that she claimed he tried to rape her, but Mr Bobbitt was acquitted of this.

After he fell asleep, Lorena went out to the kitchen and chose her weapon - an eight-inch knife. She then returned to the bedroom and sliced off his penis. In a rage, she jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the severed end out of the window. 

The former US Marine recalls seeing torrents of blood gush from his groin before losing consciousness. He next woke momentarily in hospital, about to enter surgery.

Fortunately, realising her error, Lorena had called the emergency services and a painstaking search had found his penis in a field.

Doctors James T. Sehn and David Berman worked for 10 hours re-joining his detached penis - carefully stitching together nerve endings to give him the best possible chance of regaining feeling.

Although he was initially told he would never be able to have sex again, Mr Bobbitt claims to have subsequently slept with more than 70 women - and has even starred in pornographic movies.

Last year it was revealed he had become a devout Christian, had put his past wild behaviour behind him and now planned to settle down with his third wife.

While he would not wish his horrific ordeal - which still gives him nightmares 20 years after it happened - upon anybody, Mr Bobbitt last year said he cannot deny it has transformed his life.

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'The doctors told me I would never be able to have sex again because my injuries were so bad. But I've proved them wrong time and time again. I believe I've slept with 70 women since the incident.'

He added: 'Being the most famous man to have his penis chopped off does have its advantages. It definitely has not hurt my love life - in fact it improved it.'
