Darwin the baby koala is looking for a friend after being brought into a wildlife shelter at Rawson, 20 km east of Melbourne.

The joey was orphaned when timber workers failed to see him and his mother in a tree they were felling in the area.They rushed the 250 gram joey to koala expert Colleen Wood who has nursed the little boy around the clock for the past two months.

'Koalas are actually incredibly maternal and the mothers will often manage to fall in a way that protects their babies over themselves,' says Wood from the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter. 'This is how we think little Darwin survived.'

Darwin is now five months old and after a special 'every four hour' feeding routine, has almost doubled in weight. Wood says he is inseparable from his friend George the teddy bear, but she needs to find a real life companion to help the joey learn how to survive on his own.

'It's very funny, people will see me feeding and they look at this teddy bear and they look at me really strangely until I tell them: "No, there's a real Koala under there, behind George!."' she says.

Darwin will remain under watchful eyes at the wildlife shelter for about another 10 months before he is released back into the wild to fend for himself. Collen Wood and volunteers at the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter will tag him and other koalas to track how they're doing in their natural habitat. 

 'We monitor them over the years and there's just nothing more rewarding than to see a female you've nursed since it was a joey having young of its own in the bush.'  

According to Wood, about 78 per cent of injured or orphaned koalas that are released will survive.

'We always try to release them close to the areas they come from because they'll seek those places out - but sometimes this is problematic,' she says. 'We've had some koalas return to bushfire damaged areas and some have died after falling from weak branches that just snap. We have problems with cows; cows hate koalas and will call the rest of the herd to stomp on them - and we have the chlamydia disease which they pick up from other animals like cattle and which is just horrific.'

Wood, who began caring for injured wildlife 19 years ago, says the biggest threats to koala populations in Australia are increased habitat destruction, fires and the drying out of the landscape because of climate change. 

'We really don't know enough about koalas in Victoria and this is a big concern, we need more research,' she says. 

Darwin required special feeds every four hours when he came to the shelter because his stomach had not yet developed the enzymes to breakdown eucalyptus leaves

Wildlife carer Colleen Wood said Darwin was 'borderline' when he came to the shelter; 'We usually wouldn't accept joey koalas under 250 grams because they will rarely make it' she says, but Darwin  has almost doubled in weight since he first came to the shelter three months ago

With joey season starting early this year, Wood says she will soon see a lot of babies coming in because of road hits, dog attacks, tree-felling accidents and bushfires. She says more than 200 baby koalas came in to the centre last year, and the numbers are growing. 

But for now, Darwin will continue to enjoy his padded tree fork stand, heated to the temperature of his mother's pouch. And he will most likely be paired up with another adult female to help him socialise.  

'He's a very lucky boy,' says Woods. 'He'll do fine.'
