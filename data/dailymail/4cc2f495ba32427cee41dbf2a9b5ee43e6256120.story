Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay is one of the most infamous prisons in the world, from which it is claimed that no one ever escaped.

Could it have been because the dinners were so good?

Certainly before it closed in 1963 the prison had a reputation ‘for dishing up the best prison food in the United States,’ claims the Eclipse Restaurant at Hyatt Regency San Francisco.

For the next month, the restaurant will feature a special Alcatraz dinner menu from 5 to 10 pm every day featuring such delights as clam chowder, meat loaf and banana bread pudding. The dishes will even be served on prison trays.

The commemorative menu is part of a larger Alcatraz exhibit at the hotel - ‘Alcatraz: Life on the Rock’ - which is on display in its vast atrium until Oct. 25.

Alcatraz was known for housing some of the worst hoodlums America had ever known including Al Capone and George ‘Machine-Gun’ Kelly.

Bosses were apparently strong believers that a well-fed prison population which make for an easier environment to manage and ensure less riots.

Choice
of Entrée: Boiled Short Ribs with Horseradish Sauce; Baked Meat Loaf 
with Pan Gravy; Spaghetti Italienne; or Baked Halibut with Spanish Sauce

Served with: Lettuce Salad; Fresh Green Beans; and Mashed Potatoes

Dessert: Banana Bread Pudding

In fact the food served up was often compared by those that tasted it to being better than a lot of restaurants.

‘The
food at Alcatraz was as good as you would get in a good restaurant that
specialized in home-cooked meals, better than most,’ recalled William 
Baker, a former inmate.

Available
from Aug. 8 to Sept. 2, the hotel-restaurant will feature the Alcatraz 
dinner menu costs $28 per person and includes a starter, choice of 
entrée with side dishes; and dessert, reports ABC News.

The
Alcatraz menu is, the hotel said, a modern-day version of what might be
served today, if The Rock were still in operation, using modern cooking
styles, ingredients and presentation.
