The birth of a baby giraffe and her wobbly first steps have been captured on CCTV cameras at Queensland's Australia Zoo.

First-time mum Penny went into labour earlier than expected last week, with the healthy female calf born at 11.51am last Thursday.

Zoo keepers had moved Penny into the birthing suite just a day before after noticing she had distanced herself from the other giraffes, which is a common behavioural characteristic for a soon-to-give-birth giraffe.

Footage of the birth shows the calf dropping out of her mother and just an hour later taking her first steps within the enclosure.

Australia Zoo curator Kelsey Engle said the newborn was a healthy weight and height.

'She found her feet very soon after birth, and started suckling from mum not long after,' Ms Engle told the Brisbane Times.

'Penny is also adjusting really well to motherhood in these early stages. She began licking and cleaning the baby almost immediately after the birth, and seems to be a really affectionate mother.

'In fact, the bub is following her mum so closely that the pair has already ventured outside together.'

The female calf is the second birth in the giraffe enclosure in a month with Tulip being born in July 10.
