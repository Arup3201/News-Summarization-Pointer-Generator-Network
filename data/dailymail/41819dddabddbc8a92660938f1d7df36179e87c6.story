The moment outraged figure skater Ashley Wagner was caught on TV mouthing 'b******t' at her low score has become one of the most re-watched of the Sochi Olympics.

Users of the TiVo digital TV recorder wound back to see the American athlete's sour gasp - which she has defended saying 'I wear my heart on my sleeve' - more than any other Olympic moment on Saturday.

Viewers were also fascinated with young women falling over, with face-planting snowboarders claiming three of the five most-rewound moments on Sunday.

Before and after: After finishing what she believed was a stellar short-program performance, Wagner's beams of delight turned to disgust as she received an unexpectedly low score from the judgesÂ

Wagner's star moment came as the 22-year-old scored 61.30 in her Olympic debut after skating to Pink Floyd's 1975 hit Shine On You Crazy Diamond.

Although she clearly thought she had deserved a higher mark, she still made it through to the next round.

Her reaction and a GIF depicting her pithy one-word response went viral on social media, with Facebook saying Wagner was one of the most talked-about topics of the weekend.

But she was beaten into first place by Canadian sisters
 Justine and Chloe Dufour-Lapointe, who took gold and silver in the women's moguls.

Meanwhile Sunday's rewinding was dominated by scenes of female snowboarders falling over.

'I wear my heart on my sleeve': Wagner appeared on the Today show Monday, saying she doesn't have much of a pokerface in competition

Three of TiVo's five most rewatched 
moments featured snowboarders Aimee Fuller 
of Great Britain and Ty Walker and Jessika Jenson of the U.S. taking 
falls - while the gold medal run by American Jamie Anderson did not even
 feature.

Two spectacular falls did not feature, however: a face-plant by 
Switzerland's Isabel Derungs and a hard fall by Sarka Pancochova of 
the Czech Republic, who cracked the back of her helmet when her head 
snapped back and hit the snow.

TiVo's other two favorites were the acrobatic Russian skater, Julia Lipnitskaia, and American figure skater Gracie Gold.

Speaking yesterday on the Today Show,
 when Savannah Guthrie told Wagner it seemed like she didn't have much 
of a pokerface, she replied: 'No not at all... I wear my heart on my 
sleeve.'

Wagner added 
that she was out to prove herself in the team competition after 
performing a less-than-perfect routine in the qualifying competition.

While
 the top three competitors at the U.S. Championships are usually 
selected for the Olympic team, Wagner placed fourth and was chosen over 
third-place skater Mirai Nagasu.

Despite the low score, Wagner said she was happy she performed so well in the team competition.

'I needed that performance going into the individual event,' she added. 'I came off rocky at nationals and I needed to prove myself more than anything - that one competition didn't define me.'

Her performance was enough to propel the U.S. team to the second round of competition, and teammate Gracie Gold's long-program helped give the team a bronze medal.

Russia placed first in the competition and Canada earned the silver medal. The Americans' main competition, Russian skater Julia Lipnitskaia, is just 15 years old.

The American ladies will be back on the rink to battle Lipnitskaia and the rest of the world competition on February 20.
