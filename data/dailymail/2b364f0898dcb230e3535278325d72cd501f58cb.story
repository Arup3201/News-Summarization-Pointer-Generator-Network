Belo Horizonte, according to traveller interest measured on TripAdvisor.

The TripAdvisor destination page for Manaus, which hosts England’s first group match against Italy, also saw a boost in interest from the UK.

Last night crowds of up to 26,000 fans watched the opening match between Brazil and Croatia at the Fifa Fan Fest in Manaus.

Searches for Manuas were up 105 per cent year on year since December’s group draw.

The TripAdvisor destination page for Sao
 Paulo, already a popular destination among Brits, has also seen a 44 
per cent boost in traffic since being named the venue for England’s 
second group match against Uruguay.

of drizzle), is the largest city in Brazil and is known for its 
unreliable weather, its architecture, 
gastronomy, traffic problems and skyscrapers.

Optimism obviously springs eternal for England fans, with Recife - 
which will host the winners of England’s group in the second round - 
seeing a 93 per cent boost in UK traveller interest.

Footy on the beach? Recife also saw a massive boost in interest from World Cup fans

Recife is located where the Beberibe River meets the Capibaribe River where it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The many rivers, small islands and over 50 bridges found in Recife city centre are the reason it is often called the 'Brazilian Venice'.

Research findings by Brazil’s Ministry of Tourism estimates the economic windfall for Brazil based on the influx of visitors to add roughly $3.03 (£1.7 billion) to its economy.

The Tourism Ministry research says that 1.9 million of the 3.7 million people expected to travel throughout Brazil during the 2014 FIFA World Cup are those believed to actually attend World Cup matches and FIFA Fan Fests.

The other 1.8 million estimated visitors are believed to be travelling to Brazil to enjoy festivities linked to the World Cup.

The TripAdvisor data is based on year-year-year proportional traffic increase from the UK to the destination pages on TripAdvisor.co.uk between December 2012 - May 2013 compared to December 2013 - May 2014.
