The most successful British criminal ever caught: Curtis Warren once made the Sunday Times Rich List

Britain's most notorious drug baron has been issued with an extraordinary warning to stop running his multi-million-pound criminal empire when he is released from jail.

Curtis Warren, 48, a convicted killer who once topped Interpol’s most wanted list, is in a high-security prison serving a 13-year sentence for cannabis smuggling.

In an unprecedented step, the order instructs the Liverpudlian to stop breaking the law.

Last night, the drug lord’s lawyer said his client is expected to fight the order on the grounds of his ‘human rights’.

Warren, the only drug dealer to feature on the Sunday Times Rich List, has an illegal empire estimated to be worth up to £300million.

He is in Full Sutton prison near York.

The proposed Serious Crime Prevention Order was brought on behalf of HM Revenue and Customs and signed by Alun Milford, the director of the Serious Organised Crime Division of the CPS.

There will be a High Court hearing in December in which he will contest it.

The terms of the order include:

Warren, a former bouncer once described as the ‘most successful British criminal who has ever been caught’, was jailed in 1995 while living in the Netherlands after Dutch police found a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125million.

While in prison, he killed a convicted murderer, Cemal Guclu, during a fight.

In February 2005, the Dutch police 
charged him with running a drugs-smuggling cartel from his jail cell, 
but the case was eventually dismissed because of insufficient evidence.

Released in 2007, having served 
two-thirds of the 16-year sentence, Warren was arrested the same year 
and convicted of a £1million cannabis smuggling plot in Jersey in 
October 2009.

He was transferred under a prisoner exchange agreement to mainland Britain. He now faces a confiscation hearing involving £160million.

Warren’s solicitor, Keith Dyson, said: ‘There will be a human rights challenge, of course.

‘These are very oppressive orders, they absolutely restrict your civil liberties and it is supported by a file of evidence that Curtis says is inaccurate.

‘In a nutshell, the evidence relates to his previous convictions.’

An HM Revenue and Customs source said: ‘This is a deliberate attempt to make sure his activities come to an end. He’s got a lot of money and a lot of influence.

‘He’s a gangster involved in organised crime.

‘We will take steps necessary to put an end to his activities. It’s designed to make sure people don’t profit from their crimes while they do time.

‘He’s a bloke who goes to jail with millions and millions of pounds. We take steps to make sure they don’t profit and cease to have influence.’

A restriction on Warren’s use of communication devices and public telephones;

A restriction on him being in possession of more than £1,000 to ‘make it harder for him to purchase drugs or reward his criminal associates’;

@highlight

A financial reporting requirement ‘that will deter him from committing acquisitive crime, and give the law enforcement authorities the opportunity to investigate any wealth he comes into’.
