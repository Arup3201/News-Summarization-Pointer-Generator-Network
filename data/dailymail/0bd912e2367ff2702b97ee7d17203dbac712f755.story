He's called Mick, possesses a pair of remarkably large lips and likes nothing better than commanding the attention of an admiring crowd.

Indeed this little lumpsucker fish is a star attraction at the Lyme Regis Aquarium in Dorset.

The next time Sir Mick Jagger is down that way perhaps he should call in and compare pouts with his namesake.

The fish also seems to share Jagger's 
womanizing ways, as although they are normally a dull grey, they turn a 
bright, vivid red colour for the mating season to show they are sexually
 available.

Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, 69, is famous for his pouting lips and expressive mouth that he passed onto his model daughters Georgia May, Jade and Elizabeth Jagger.

Lumpsucker fish are small marine fish that are found in the cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and mostly in the North Pacific ocean.

They have spherical, portly bodies and 'suckers' which are really modified pelvic fins which have evolved in adhesive disks.

They are poor swimmers and spend most of their time near the bottom of the ocean at depths of up to 1,700 metres.

The Lyme Regis Aquarium has introduced the lumpsucker fish as its latest attraction for the people of Dorset.

They aim to encourage children and adults to discover close up the local fish and marine life of the Jurassic coast and learn about Lyme's maritime history.

As well as the lumpsucker they have lobster, starfish, ballan wrasse, short spined sea scorpion, and a sea mouse.

Kids are also encouraged to feed the mullet daily.
