A 14-year-old boy has been charged with murder for stabbing his classmate to death with a kitchen knife outside their school gates.

Noel Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab 14-year-old Timothy Crump three times in the torso after school in the Bronx, New York on Wednesday.

Witnesses said that Estevez pulled out a knife after Crump punched him, while friends claimed the deadly dispute came after weeks of Crump bullying his killer - beating him, teasing him for his mother's recent drugs bust and leading him to attempt suicide.

Estevez was charged with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter on Wednesday night. He's being charged as an adult, police 
sources told the New York Daily News.

Dispute: Noel Estevez, left, allegedly stabbed Timothy Crump, right, repeatedly in the torso, killing him, as they left school on Wednesday. Friends claimed Crump had bullied Estevez

The bloody scene unfolded after the teens were let out of class at I.S. 117 around 3pm.

Several boys said they saw Crump confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose, the New York Times reported.

In retaliation, Estevez pulled out his knife and stabbed Crump as teachers and school safety officers ran over to stop the fight, they said.

Chailyn Oballe, 12, added to amNewYork that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school.

'And
 that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like
 he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his 
pocket and covered it with his shirt.'

As he tried to leave, people scattered screaming 'someone has a knife' and the boy was stopped by a security guard.

Charged: Estevez can be seen center being hauled in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second degree murder and has been charged as an adult, police said

Crump was taken to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead and a knife was recovered outside the school, Department of Education Spokeswoman Marge Feinberg said.

Those who knew the boys, who were friends on Facebook, have given differing accounts of their relationship.

Police sources told the New York Daily News that Estevez attacked Crump because he had beaten him and robbed him a few weeks ago, and other friends said he had long been bullied by Crump.

'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbor Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '(He
 would say) things like, "Ha ha, your mom's a crackhead, you're 
stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mom’s locked up!.'

The boy's mother was arrested on drug charges last week, Arroyo said, which Crump 'found funny.' She said he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him.

The treatment eventually left Estevez suicidal, another family friend, Marisol Perez, said.

Fight: Witnesses said they saw Crump punching Estevez before Estevez pulled out the knife

Arrest: A security guard reportedly stopped the fight outside the school, IS 177, and the boy was arrested

'Two
 weeks ago he tried to hang himself in his own apartment,' Perez said. 'His 
father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.'

Estevez was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this week, even though he told his father he didn't want to go because of the bullies.

'His father brought him to school this morning and said, "Don’t worry, just go straight home after school",' Perez said.

But Crump's neighbors at a shelter called the boy quiet - and branded Estevez as the bully.

'He wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 'He'd say, "I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you." I’ve seen him say it.'

Grief counselors will be available at the school on Thursday.
