Furious National Lottery players yesterday threatened to mount a boycott when ticket prices double to £2 in September.

A snap poll found that as many as eight out of ten could abandon the lottery. Others said they would buy premium bonds or play the Irish lottery instead.

MPs and campaigners said the increase was a ‘tax on the poor’ and ‘sheer greed’ and research revealed pensioners and those on low incomes would be hit hardest.

Research suggests average spending on the draw is just under £6 and this would double to £12 for those who want to play the same multiple series of numbers.

Many will be anxious not to drop a sequence they have been trying to win with for years.

A study from 2009 found lower-income groups spend more than high earners by £5.92 a week to £5.33. Pensioners were also found to be more likely to play.

Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton in Essex, said: ‘With the price of everything going up, and given the profits they make, it would be nice if the people who run the National Lottery didn’t put up the price of a ticket. It’s not as if they are short of a few bob.’ 

On Twitter, the official  @TNLUK lottery account was bombarded with complaints. Customers called the increase a ‘rip-off’ and complained that organiser Camelot was forcing customers to ‘fund the company directors’ lavish lifestyles’ by doubling prices.

Camelot’s chief executive, Dianne Thompson, earns around £1million a year, not including her bonus.

On the National Lottery’s official Facebook page players queued up to say they would no longer buy tickets. One said Camelot should ‘hang their heads in shame’.

Another said she was closing her online lottery account and buying premium bonds instead.

Denis Vaughan, president of the Council for the Advancement of Arts Recreation & Education, which acts as a lottery watchdog, said: ‘This increase shows how far from its original purpose the lottery has come.

‘The rise is unjustified and I think it’s likely people will walk away from it as a result. Not enough of the money is going to the right good causes.’

People have taken to Twitter to vent their anger at plans to increase the price of the National Lottery to £2

A poll on the Guardian website asked: ‘If you bet on the National Lottery, would you carry on doing so at double the ticket price?’ Eighty per cent of respondents voted no while 20 per cent chose yes.Camelot, which is owned by a Canadian pension fund, is likely to see huge revenue rises as a result of the changes.

And the Treasury, which received £423million in lottery duty in just six months last year, is also likely to earn more.

As well as the price rise, average weekend jackpots will go up to £5million in a revamp of the main Lotto game.

The prize for getting three numbers will go up from £10 to £25, and the prize for matching four will go from £60 to £100.

A new raffle prize of £20,000 will go to at least 50 Lotto players every week. However, other prizes will fall.

The decision was approved by the regulator, the National Lottery Commission. Culture Secretary Maria Miller was also aware of the decision.

Camelot said research revealed the Lotto draw was ‘getting a bit tired and jaded’ and customers wanted ‘more prizes and more ways to win’.

Around 60 per cent of the public play regularly.
