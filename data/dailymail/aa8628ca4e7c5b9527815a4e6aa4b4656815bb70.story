Arrested: Talysa Herron, 29, reportedly chased the girl down and hit her in the face in the incident in San Antonio, Texas, on Saturday

A mother has been arrested after she allegedly hit a ten-year-old girl who refused to share an ice cream with her daughter.

Talysa Herron, 29, reportedly chased the girl down and hit her in the face in the incident in San Antonio, Texas, on Saturday.

She then allegedly followed the unnamed girl home in her car and launched a vicious attack on the girl's mother until the police arrived.

Bexar County Sheriff's deputies said the unnamed ten-year-old had bought the ice cream from a van before taking it with her as she played with nearby 
children.

But when Herron's four-year-old asked her for 
her ice cream, she allegedly slapped the girl's hand away as she tried to grab it.

The older 
girl began walking home but enraged Herron
approached and hit her in the face. She then followed her home in her 
car, police said.

The ten-year-old's mother, Cyndi Lafontaine, confronted Herron but was herself punched and beaten until police were called.

Herron has been charged with injury to a child.

Deputies said the two families have had issues in the past.
