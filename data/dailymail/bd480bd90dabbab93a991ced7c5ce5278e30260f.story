A stunning silver apple specially commissioned by Princess Diana to mark her first solo visit to New York after separating from Prince Charles is to fetch more than £3,000 at auction.

Diana jetted to the ‘Big Apple’ on Concorde in 1989 and brought the city to a standstill as she travelled by motorcade to visit children suffering from AIDS at the Harlem Hospital Center.

The Princess, who received a ‘Humanitarian of the Year’ award from Henry Kissinger, marked the triumphant tour by presenting four life-size silver apples to the staff who accompanied her.

Diana gave one of the silver apples to her devoted dresser Fay Appleby, it is expected to fetch £3,000 at auction

Diana gave silver apples to her lady-in-waiting Anne Beckwith-Smith, Royal protection officer -Insp Allan Peters, baggage-master Sgt Ron Lewis and her devoted dresser Fay Appleby.

Fay, who travelled the world with Diana for six years, was secretly supported by the Princess as she fought a brave 15-year battle against cancer.

She died in 2002 aged just 47, leaving behind 11-year-old twin boys Chris and Ben.

The pair, now 22, are selling the huge collection of Princess Diana memorabilia their mother left them - to help them get a foot on the property ladder.

The twins don't remember meeting Princess Diana or Prince Harry but the late Princess was a great friend of their mother

Chris said: 'We were only 11 when our mother passed away but she told us how she loved working for the Princess and helping her to look so amazing in all her wonderful dresses, outfits and jewellery.

'She was very loyal to Princess Diana and she said she became a great friend - her best friend, in a way.'

The silver apple, which is engraved with the Princess’s crowned ‘D’ monogram and the date ‘1st-3rd February 1989’, is to be sold at auctioneers Reeman Dansie’s sale of Royal memorabilia in Colchester next Tuesday.

Fay was with Diana on the 1985 visit to Washington when she famously danced with John Travolta.

Before her death, Fay recalled: 'Evelyn and I had helped her into the lovely gown and she came back looking flushed. She giggled and said "Fay, I’ve just danced with John Travolta." I giggled along with her. I don’t think it was planned.'

She recalled how newlywed Diana joked: 'Phew! I’m glad that’s over - just like any other bride,' as she helped her down from the coach after the Royal Wedding in 1981.

The auction includes two 18-carat gold Baume & Mercier ladies’ watches bearing the crests of the Saudi Royal family and the Emir of Qatar, are estimated at £200 to £300.

Fay’s life was turned upside down just three weeks before her wedding to RAF corporal Steve Appleby in October 1987, after doctors told her a lump on her tongue was malignant.

When Fay broke the devastating news to Diana, the Princess hugged her and said: 'I’m so sorry, Fay. Don’t worry, I’ll help in any way I can.'

Fay was told she would have to undergo a two-month course of 40 radiation treatments and Diana secretly accompanied her to London’s St Bart’s Hospital whenever she was free.

Speaking in 1997, Fay said: 'The Princess was a great comfort to me when I needed her. When she couldn’t come. she gave me her chauffeur to drive me there. She was incredibly supportive.

'I decided to go ahead [with the wedding] and the Princess asked if she could come. I was thrilled. We had to keep it secret. Diana said "I don’t want anything to overshadow your big day, Fay".

Fay travelled the world with Diana for six years and fought a brave 15-year battle against cancer, secretly supported by the Princess, before she sadly died in 2002 aged just 47

'When I walked up the aisle, I saw her sitting at the back of the church and we shared a smile. She signed the register and stayed for the meal.'

Diana also kept her dresser’s spirits up by sending her a string of saucy birthday cards.

They include one showing a couple with a corgi on a castle’s turret with the caption ‘It’s not much, but we like to call it home.’

Another shows a silver-haired pensioner climbing into a Mr Universe suit in front of his wife in bed with the message ‘May all your birthday dreams come true.’ Signed by Diana, they are estimated at £200 to £300.

Auctioneer Mr Grinter said: 'This is a fascinating collection of letters, photographs, cards and items which shows how two women from very different backgrounds came to work so closely together and build up such a strong friendship.

'It is very touching to see how much care and support Princess Diana showed towards Fay and her two sons during her illness.'

Six-footer Chris. of Taunton, Somerset, joked: 'My mother told me Princess Diana once changed my nappy at a barbecue at Highgrove, but I’m afraid I was too young to remember it.'

Fay attended Princess Diana’s funeral at Westminster Abbey after was killed in Paris 1997. She said: 'Diana touched so many people. The memories of our time together are so precious. It was a privilege to be a part of her life.'

Sadly, brave Fay lost her own battle against cancer in 2002.

In another lot, one of the first pieces of Prince William and Kate’s Royal Wedding cake to be sold in its original presentation tin is estimated to fetch £200 to £300.
