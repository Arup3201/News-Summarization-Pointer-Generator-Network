Amanda Knox was not a sex goddess, but ‘shy and bumbling’ in bed, her ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito has claimed.

Rather than taking part in deviant sex games, the 26-year-old relished having her hair combed, her one-time lover has revealed.

The disclosing comments come as Sollecito, 29, and Knox, who spent four years in prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, prepare to stand retrial at the end of this month.

The pair were convicted of the brutal killing of the Leeds University student in 2009, but freed in 2011 on appeal.

Miss Mercher was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house in Perugia in central Italy that she shared with American Miss Knox in November 2007.

However, earlier this year, Italy’s highest court sensationally overturned the appeal verdict and ordered Knox and Sollecito to stand trial again.

In court, Knox was painted as a sexually deviant enchantress who instigated the murder as part of an erotic game.

But her former lover has rubbished the idea of a sex game as ‘ridiculous’.

Victim: Miss Kercher was found lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut in the Perugia house she shared with Knox in 2007. In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of her murder, but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were overturned in October 2011

'She wasn’t remotely deviant,' he told Italian weekly magazine Oggi. ‘Amanda was shy, inexpert and a little ham-handed: like me in fact.

‘I don’t want to go into details, it wouldn’t be right . But I will tell you, for example, that many times more than anything else she just wanted me to comb her hair.’ 

After their successful appeal, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle where she is studying creative writing.

She has said that she will not return to Italy for the retrial, although if she is found guilty, Italy is expected to start extradition proceedings.

Sollecito, who is close to graduating in Robotic Surgery from the University of Verona, has said he will be at the new appeal trial to defend himself.

Earlier this year, he moved briefly to Lugarno in Switzerland in the hope of starting a foundation that investigates unsolved crimes.

But within only a few months, his residence permit was revoked when authorities discovered his pending legal battles.

If the trial ends favourably, Sollecito said he plans to move to California.

‘As a computer programmer Silicon Valley is like Mecca for me,' he told Oggi. ‘But I’m on standby. I see that everything else moves but I feel like I’m frozen. By annulling our absolution, the Supreme Court has put me back in a prison.'

Knox is pictured arriving at her appeal trial in Perugia, Italy, on October 3, 2011. After the conviction was overturned, Knox and Sollecito were immediately released from prison and Knox flew back to America and signed a lucrative book contract

He added that he has been in love 'only once' since Amanda and is now single as he struggles to make relationships work.

'It didn’t last, said Sollecito. 'They all end badly, partly my own fault. If you don’t have a life, how can you share it with someone?'

A recent Facebook appeal for financial aid has raised 20,000 dollars, but much more is needed even to pay off Sollecito's legal debts.

His family has spent more than a million euros on lawyers since the beginning, he estimated.

The retrial in Florence starts at the end of this month.
