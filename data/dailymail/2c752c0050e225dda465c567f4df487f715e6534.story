Chanel has the tweed jacket, Miu Miu the quirky phone case - but when it comes to the It Bag, Louis Vuitton rules the runway.

And today's SS15 catwalk presentation on the final day of Paris Fashion Week only served to reassert the brand's bag genius.

The eyes in the front row were permanently fixed on the  totes swinging jauntily down the runway.

Louis Vuitton presented an array of seventies inspired bags at their SS15 catwalk 

The brand has always been most famous for its luggage, with style icons such as Jackie Onassis adopting the signature monogrammed cases back in Sixties.

Since then, it become the luggage of choice for everyone from Kim Kardashian to Alexa Chung, with countless airport pap shots featuring the brown and cream leather cases.

For his second season at the French fashion house, designer Nicolas Ghesquière, 43, presented a collection that looked back to the Seventies.

Wide-legged velvet flares were paired with patterns that echoed the interiors of that decade in bold floral prints. 

The bags took a step away from the traditional logo totes that the brand is famous for

Always on trend Miranda Kerr appeared at this morning's show with the latest Louis Vuitton accessory draped over one shoulder 

Nicolas Ghesquiere didn't steer completely away from tradition with the LV print appearing on a select few handbags but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown

The theme of the time warp extended to the accessories - and of course the brand's famous arm candy.

Bags took centre stage in all forms - with several even appearing as a print on the fabric of the models' skirts. 

Louis Vuitton took a step away from the brown leather bags and LV initials that the brand is so famous for.

The bags that replaced them came in the same seventies colour palette as the collection in an array of mohogany, orange and, of course, denim.

As well as smaller clutches Nicolas presented large carry-alls perfect for working girls

Most were paired with the chain strap often associated with the classic Chanel bag. Both innovative in design and practical the chain can prevent bag theft as thieves are unable to snip the strap.

But Nicolas Ghesquiere didn't break completely with tradition, with the LV print appearing a select few handbags, but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown 

Miranda Kerr was lucky enough to have already got her hands on this small box clutch 

A crocodile skin effect seemed to be the pattern of choice for the brand's latest accessories 

The seventies theme continued onto the bags that seemed to have taken inspiration from bold prints of that decade 

This is not the first time that we have seen Nicolas Ghesquiere work his magic on the old favourite.

Last season - his very first at the brand - the designer put a new spin on the traditional logo.

Models took to the catwalk carrying the Petite-Malle, a rectangular shaped bag with a fold over lid top, clasps and buckles give the appearance of a traditional vanity case or treasure chest. 

The show always attracts plenty of celebrity fans with today's front row including Selena Gomez, Anna Wintour and Michelle Williams.

Miranda Kerr proved to be the biggest fan of all. Refusing to wait until after the show to get her hands on the latest designs, the 31-year-old model was spotted wearing one of the bags seen on today's runway as she entered the show.

The rest of us, however, might have to wait a little longer - and save up for a few years - before we get our hands on them...
