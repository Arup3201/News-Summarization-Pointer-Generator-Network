An Ohio wife and mother is facing felony theft charges after duping her entire town into believing she had terminal intestinal cancer.

Police say Mindy Taylor, 35, of Chillicothe, managed to bilk friends, family, neighbors and old college chums out of over $20,000 while even her husband was convinced his wife was fighting for her life.

And she managed to milk it further by putting on a brave face. Not only did she play the part of the dying mother, but she had everyone in awe of her strength of will throughout what they believed to be an horrific ordeal.

Doing alright: Ohio mother Mindy Taylor, 35, allegedly duped most of the town of Chillicothe and even a town a state away in Pennsylvania that she was dying from intestinal cancer

Outrageous: Two charitable giving sites sprung up for Mindy, created by concerned friends, family and even strangers who called themselves Mindy's Army. This one raised $13,234 of a $30,000 goal to offset her 'medical expenses'

According to the Columbus Dispatch, Taylor had a long history of illnesses.

She claimed to suffer from heart disease, strokes and lupus from a young age. Specialists across the country were unable to figure out just how and why she suffered so many health problems.

When things seemed to become even worse sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, her friends, family and neighbors rallied around her.

She had intestinal cancer, she said, and was fearing for the worst.

But Taylor put on a brave face and became an admired figure in her central Ohio town.

She began to post her day to day struggles to a fundraising blog as donations began to pour in from people who called themselves Mindy's Army.

Friends even organized a charity run and purchased t-shirts to support her and her family.

In deep: Family and friends rallied around the 35-year-old mother and even organized and fundraiser run to benefit her, her 7-year-old daughter and her husband

Bizarre: Even Taylor's husband believed his wife could soon die of intestinal cancer that seemed to have moved to her liver

'#mindysarmy isn’t just about me,' she wrote in a seemingly humble February 16 post. 'It’s about anyone that is fighting with an illness or cancer or a hard time, so try to remember that as you look down and see your wrist. Stay positive and always try to do the next right thing!'

Those wrists were adorned in Live Strong style bracelets, only they were for Mindy's Army.

A day after her face appeared on the February 24 cover of a local newspaper with a headline touting her Mindy's 'Friends, Family and Faith' she posted this:

'I so appreciate everyone ... the texts to keep me awake, the prayers, the support, the ongoing financial contributions are all appreciated so much.'

Everyone she knew thought she was going to die, including her husband and her mother, who raised $7,000 for her treatment a state away in her Pennsylvania town.

Well, almost everyone.

Someone who saw Mindy on the newspaper cover had doubts, and voiced them in a call to the police.

'It’s a lie,' said the tipster. 'You should check it out.'

And when police did just that, they discovered it really was a lie.

Taylor had raised at least $20,000 from towns in two different states while keeping everyone except her 7-year-old little girl in a state of fear she could die anytime.

Taylor was arrested and charged with felony theft.

Considerate: Only Taylor's 7-year-old daughter was spared the terrible news that her mother was dying

But Ross County Prosecutor Matt Schmidt believes the scheme was more for the attention than for the money and some of Taylor's illnesses may have, in fact, been real.

The Columbus Dispatch reports that the former Chillicothe schools employee left her job in 2012 and has been collecting social security ever since.

And the Chillicothe Gazette reports that she may have a history of heart trouble.

Taylor has now applied for what's called a diversion, which will clear her of the felony charge if she pays back the $20,000-plus sum she bilked from concerned loved ones.

Taylor's attorney Jeff Benson said she's already returned much of the cash. He also said he believes Taylor's real physical illness will make itself known soon, whether or not it's the terminal cancer she once claimed to have.

'There’s been a significant change in her physical appearance,' he told the Dispatch. 'There’s something going on.'

'It's a lie': A February 24 local newspaper cover featuring Taylor became her undoing. A reader called a tip into Chillicothe police, who investigated and found that Taylor never had cancer at all
