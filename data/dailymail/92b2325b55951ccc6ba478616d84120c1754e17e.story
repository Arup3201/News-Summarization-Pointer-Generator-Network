As a billionaire playboy who claims to have bedded 10,000 women, Cecil Chao has no doubts about his own sexuality.

Now he is trying to dictate the sexuality of his children too.

The 76-year-old property and shipping tycoon is offering a £40million ‘marriage bounty’ to any man who can win the heart of his lesbian daughter – and turn her straight.

Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012

He announced the reward after his daughter, Gigi, married her same-sex partner in France.

Refusing to accept the gay union, he pledged the fortune to any potential male suitor able to walk the 33-year-old University of Manchester graduate down the aisle at a traditional wedding.

Dismissed nuptials: Father Cecil Chao has dismissed 'false reports' of his daughter's lesbian nuptials and insists she is still single

The famously promiscuous Hong Kong 
businessman dismissed ‘false reports’ of his daughter’s lesbian nuptials
 and insisted she was still single.

‘I don’t mind whether he is rich or 
poor – the important thing is that he is generous and kind hearted,’ he 
said of the  ideal husband for his daughter.

‘Gigi
 is a very good woman with both talents and looks. She is devoted to her
 parents, is generous and does volunteer work,’ he told the South China 
Morning Post.

Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong.

According to reports, the spat 
between Mr Chao and his daughter erupted last week when she announced at
 an event in Beijing that she tied the knot with her long-term lover, 
Sean Eav, five months ago. A regular on the city’s social circuit and in
 celebrity magazines, Mr Chao has never been married. Gigi is the oldest
 of his three children with three mothers. 

In addition to the dowry, he has also offered to start his potential son-in-law up in his own business.

He
 said the prize money was ‘an inducement to attract someone who has the 
talent, but not the capital, to start his own business’.

According
 to the BBC, Miss Chao said she found her father’s plan ‘entertaining’ 
and wouldn’t give it too much thought until an actual suitor had been 
found.

Miss Chao graduated 
from university in 1999 with a degree in architecture. She went on to 
work for two years with prominent British architect Sir Terry Farrell.
