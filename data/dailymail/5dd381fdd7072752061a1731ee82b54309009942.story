Evil: Clappison, pictured outside Hull Crown Court today, was said by a judge to have 'blighted the lives of her children'

A mother who abused her two children and kept them locked in bedrooms that were so cold her son caught frostbite was jailed for 18 months yesterday.

Over a five-year period they were beaten, starved, forced to do manual labour instead  of going to school, given cold baths and shut up in the dark.

Both children had to sleep in their underwear without bedding or a mattress in an unheated room, Hull Crown Court was  told during Linda Clappison’s cruelty trial.

However, the 46-year-old mother managed to fool social workers by getting out toys and snacks  during a visit, and ‘made it look like happy families’.

Son Andrew Clappison told the court he endured the living hell between the ages of ten and 16 and even attempted suicide.

The daughter, who is now 13 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered similar treatment between the ages of six and 11.

She also had her head shaved five times by her mother and was ordered to lie about it being her own idea ‘because she wanted to look like Britney Spears’.

Mother-of-four Clappison, of Keyingham, East Yorkshire, was convicted of child cruelty last month. The treatment came to light when the girl went to school and told teachers she did not want to go home to her mother.

Passing sentence yesterday, Judge Michael Mettyear paid tribute to the young victims, who he described as ‘the sort of children that any parent would admire’.

He told Clappison: ‘Custody is inevitable. You have blighted the lives of these children.’

Andrew, 18, told the court he was ten when his mother changed after his father left home because she had had an affair.

His elder brother and sister also left when the abuse started.

He was kept off school half of the time but, when he did go, as soon as he returned home he was locked in his dark bedroom.

Andrew said his mother punched, slapped and kicked him, beat him with a leather belt and banged his head against a wall for no reason.

where Linda Clappison subjected her children to a 'living hell'

The worst punishment, he said, was being given a cold bath and dunked under the water.

He said: ‘I was scared of her. I had to have my tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs. I was treated like a dog.'

Abused: Andrew Clappison, now 18, was beaten and starved by his mother from the age of 10 to 16, and even attempted suicide.

In January 2010, Clappison removed his mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm under it.

Toys and the lightbulb were also taken out.

He said: ‘I was sleeping in the cold all the time. The boiler was working but I had no radiator.

‘I used to wake up with blue feet. My feet got frostbite.’

Andrew was treated for frostbite on 
all his toes on one foot and the big toe on the other. He was told to 
lie and say it was from playing outside.

The only time a social worker visited the house she was fooled into believing the children were being cared for properly.

Andrew recalled: ‘She got my toys out.

‘She made me come downstairs, put biscuits out and made it look like happy families.’

He told the court he became weak and 
thin from a diet of chocolate spread sandwiches – while his mother 
cooked hot meals for herself.

He said: ‘It was so unhealthy it was stupid.

‘At one point I was sick until she gave me something to eat. I got to starving point. I was shaking. I wished I was dead.’

His sister endured similar punishments. She said: ‘Some days she would not give us anything to eat.’

Andrew said that when his mother 
befriended a gipsy fortune teller he was then forced to work unpaid with
travellers on a market stall and at a fair, sometimes until midnight.

His sister also had to work on the stall, cleaning dogs and sweeping up.

Before Clappison was jailed for 
cruelty, the court was told that, according to her probation report, she
had no wish to be reconciled with her children.
