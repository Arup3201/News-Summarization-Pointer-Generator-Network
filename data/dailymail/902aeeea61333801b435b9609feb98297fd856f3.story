A terrified man who feared he had contracted Ebola after returning from an Africa trip last night told how an NHS call centre advised him to drive himself to hospital.

Adam Griffiths, 24, of Swansea, stunned medical teams when he turned up at the hospital with concerns he had contracted Ebola. He was then immediately placed in a decontamination room 'used for terrorist attacks'.

When met by doctors in full protective body suits, he said they were 'shocked' at the advice he was given by the NHS call centre.

Mr Griffiths, who works as a salesman, was staying in Bristol after arriving back in the UK from travelling around Africa.

He said: 'I found it odd that they would allow me to travel by myself to hospital by car.

'On arrival at Bristol South Mead Accident & Emergency unit, the staff were amazed NHS 111 had allowed me to travel by car knowing it was a possibility I had Ebola.

'NHS staff immediately panicked and told me to stay where I was, I was in a lot of pain and could hardly stand.

'Quite quickly medical staff came to my aid dressed in full personal protective equipment including suits, masks and gloves.

'I was taken to a decontamination room which is used for terrorist attacks and put under quarantine.

'Cordons were place around the area of the hospital I was in, no-one was allowed out or in.

'Multiple blood tests were taken and other tests were carried out. At 5am I was transferred to an infectious disease control suite in the hospital and was treated accordingly.'

Adam, of Swansea, South Wales, was staying in Bristol where his girlfriend lives after he began feeling ill on his return from travelling in Africa and Egypt.

Fearing he was suffering the symptoms of Ebola, he went to hospital in Bristol and was later transferred to a specialist infectious disease control suite.

Adam said: 'Just a few days ago I became really ill, having chest pains, being hot and sweaty with blood blisters on my hands and abdominal pains.

'I was staying at my girlfriend's house in Bristol and on Friday night my conditions started to get worse, I rang NHS England 111. I told them what was wrong and my symptoms and also that I had recently come back from Africa.

'I was told they would send an ambulance or I could travel myself to either of the hospitals in Bristol.

'Many hours later after blood tests were taken and specialists in London had been spoken to it was confirmed I did not have hemorrhagic fever also known as Ebola.

'However, I may still have malaria. I later discharged myself from hospital.'

A spokesman for North Bristol NHS Trust confirmed the incident happened but refuted Mr Griffiths' claim that 'staff panicked'.

He said: 'We acted appropriately and are glad Mr Griffiths had a good outcome.'

Dr Chris Burton, medical director of North Bristol NHS Trust, said: 'We can confirm that a patient was admitted to our Emergency Department with possible viral haemorrhagic fever.

'He was fully and appropriately tested, following nationally agreed guidelines, and was found not to have the Ebola virus.

'On arrival he was quickly and efficiently assessed by staff who followed the correct procedures and protocols to ensure there was no risk to any other patient or member of staff.

'We are satisfied that our staff acted professionally and appropriately throughout this process and are pleased that the patient had a good outcome.

'North Bristol NHS Trust has been following national guidance around Ebola and making plans in line with Public Health England and Department of Health advice.

'Contingency plans are in place and have been walked through with relevant staff. If and when guidance changes we will respond accordingly.

'We have the internal decontamination room in the emergency department set up for anybody who comes in through A&E suspected of having Ebola.

'Staff in the emergency department, pathology and the medical microbiology team have received training in how to respond if an Ebola case is suspected.

'A room has been prepared in case a patient comes in with suspected Ebola where staff have protective clothing and equipment and will follow an agreed process.

'If a patient tests positive for Ebola the trust will contact the Royal Free and take advice from them. At this point the expectation is that the patient would then be transferred to the Royal Free in London.'
