Tucked up snugly side by side, these beautiful triplets look a picture of health.

But their lives were saved by a risky operation performed while they were still in the womb after they developed a rare condition which threatened to kill them all.

Thanks to the skill of surgeons who performed the delicate operation, all three girls survived the surgery and were born tiny but healthy.

Triplets Eilah, Erin and Elsie underwent a risky operation performed while they were still in the womb after they developed a rare condition which threatened to kill them all - and were born tiny but healthy

Triplets Eilah, Erin and Elsie were delivered safely in October, when they weighed 3lbs 1oz, 2lbs 12oz and 2lbs respectively.

Smallest triplet Elsie was so tiny that her parents were warned she might have to stay in hospital for several months but – to their delight – she thrived and was allowed home on Christmas Eve.

Mother Laura Slinger, 26, said: ‘We have three healthy daughters and that’s the best Christmas present anyone could ask for.’

Miss Slinger, a beauty salon manager who lives near Burnley, Lancashire, and her partner Martyn Halliwell were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets, conceived naturally without fertility treatment.

But 17 weeks into the pregnancy doctors treating Miss Slinger detected a problem with the blood supply between two of the babies.

Although all three were growing in the womb together, two of the girls Eilah and Elsie were identical twins and sharing their blood supply from the placenta.

They were diagnosed with Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), a rare condition where one twin gets too much of the blood supply, while the other twin is effectively starved of nutrients.

Smaller twin Elsie was at risk of not developing properly while her bigger sister Eilah was receiving too great a share of the blood supply, putting a strain on her developing heart.

Their parents were told the triplets’ only hope was an operation to divide the twins’ blood supply, although the operation meant all three girls were at risk.

Although the independent triplet, Erin, was not affected by the shared blood supply, her life could have been in danger if the condition led to an infection in the womb or premature labour, or if the surgery went wrong.

Laura Slinger and partner Martyn Halliwell were thrilled when they discovered they were expecting triplets, conceived naturally without fertility treatment - they were devastated to discover the girls were at risk

Mr Halliwell, 29, a sales manager, said: ‘It was devastating when we knew all their lives were at risk and that they were literally killing each other.

‘We were worried about the operation as we knew that in itself could be fatal for the babies, but we knew we had no option if we wanted to try to save their lives.’

The specialist surgery was carried out by Dr Amar Bhide  at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, South London, using a laser to separate the twins’ blood supply.

The girls’ parents then faced an anxious two-week wait to learn if the new blood supply was functioning properly.

Mr Halliwell said: ‘It was very nerve-racking but the doctors and hospital staff were wonderful and reassuring.

‘We knew the operation was risky but there were also risks afterwards. Six hours later the triplets’ hearts were all still beating which was such a relief.

‘We were so thrilled when we heard that the operation had worked and we hadn’t lost any of the girls.’

The girls were initially due to be born in January but doctors scanned Miss Slinger every week after the operation and delivered the triplets at Liverpool Women’s Hospital in October.

Their premature birth meant they were all kept in hospital for weeks and they were transferred to Burnley General Hospital to be closer to their parents’ home.

The tricky operation was a success and the triplets are now safe and well at home with their parents

Eilah and Erin were allowed home in early December but smallest triplet Elsie had to stay on oxygen in hospital.

She was finally discharged on Christmas Eve, meaning the family were able to spend their first Christmas together at home, and now weighs 5lbs although she is still smaller than her 7lb sisters.

Mr Halliwell said: ‘They were so tiny when they were born, but they were all little fighters.

‘They’d had a battle for survival which began in the womb and they have fought all the way through. We are so proud of them.

‘Life is a bit manic now they’re all at home. Erin sleeps a lot but the twins seem to set each other off every time one of them starts to cry, but we are so happy. It’s the best possible Christmas present.’

Consultant obstetrician Dr Bhide, who performed the operation to separate the babies’ blood supply, said he was delighted all three triplets were born safely.

He said he had only carried out a handful of such operations, saying: ‘It is a rare operation in twins and even rarer in triplets as each normally have their own placenta.

‘It is a tricky operation with triplets as the extra baby and its placenta can make reaching the other two babies difficult. I’m delighted that the triplets have been born healthy and safe.’
