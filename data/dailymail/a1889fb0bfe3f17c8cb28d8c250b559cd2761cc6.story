Until recently, robotic arms were the stuff of comic books and cartoons, but that's about to change as more companies develop systems designed to give us extra limbs.

Roboticists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created robotic arms that lift heavy objects, grab things out of the wearer's reach and can be used to hold objects steady.

Meanwhile, engineers at Daewoo have created a similar system that gives wearers superhuman strength. 

The two systems are a cross between those used by Spider Man villain Otto Octavius, or Dr Octopus, and Inspector Gadget.

Roboticists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created robotic arms that lift heavy objects, grab things out of the wearer's reach and can be used to hold objects steady (pictured). They weigh around 10lbs (9kg) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips

There were built at the institute's d'Arbeloff Laboratory by Federico Parietti and Baldin Llorens-Bonilla, both in the Mechanical Engineering Department.

The
 extra limbs created by MIT weigh around 10lbs (9kg) so they can be 
strapped onto the shoulders or hips, but can still lift heavy objects.

The shoulder and hip-mounted limbs, created by MIT, weigh around 10lbs (9kg) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips.

The arms are designed to streamline tasks, give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body. 

While they may not use mind control, they can learn from the way a person’s body moves.

In a video demonstration, the arms are shown to mimic a person’s movements, but could one day have a mind of their own.

Meanwhile, Daewoo's arms are undergoing tests in Okpo-dong.

The exoskeleton fits anyone between 5ft 2in (1.6 metres) and 6ft tall (1.85 metres). 

It has a three-hour battery life, and the prototype can lift almost five stone in weight.

In a video demonstration, the arms are shown to mimic a person’s movements, but could one day have a mind of their own so they could come to a wearer’s aid if they needed an extra hand.

Meanwhile, Daewoo's arms are undergoing tests at the firm's Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering facility in Okpo-dong.

The exoskeleton fits anyone between 5ft 2in (1.6 metres) and 6ft tall (1.85 metres).

The 56lb (28kg) frame of carbon, aluminium alloy and steel supports itself and is designed to follow the wearer's movements. 

It has a three-hour battery life, and the prototype can lift almost five stone in weight. 

Padded straps at the thigh, waist and chest connect the user to the suit.

Hydraulic joints and electric motors running up the outside of the legs link this system to a backpack, which powers and controls the rig.

The MIT arms (prototype pictured left and right, and illustration pictured centre) are designed to streamline tasks, give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body. One day they could have a mind of their own to anticipate the wearer's needs, claim the researchers

As these drawing show, MIT’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton, which can give humans super-human strength, but could probably be used in the near future and be cheaper than full body suits

MIT's arms are different to others developed, such as the University of Pennsylvania’s Titan arm, as they can move independently of a human’s.

The Titan arm could help its wearer carry an additional 40lbs (18 kg) that is around the weight of a four-year-old child and make it feel easy as lifting a cup of tea. 

But it cannot deviate from a human’s own arm to anticipate their actions.

So many possibilities: The MIT arms could also be used to help people climb tall structures

At the moment, MIT's prototype arms could be used to open a door, leaving a human wearer's hands free to carry shopping bags, for example. But in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance (illustrated)

'The extra limbs will help them hold objects, support the human body, share a workload and streamline the execution of a task,' the MIT engineers said.

'If the movements of such supernumerary limbs are tightly coupled and coordinated with their arms, the human users may come to perceive the extra limbs as an extension of their own body.

'The overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body, working closely with the wearer.'

It was designed as an extension of the wearer's own limbs and can also be worn on the hips

This frees up their hands to perform tasks, while limbs hold objects in place

Arms mimic a wearer's movements but could one day anticipate actions to hold doors open for humans with their hands full, for example

Daweoo has a similar design that gives wearers superhuman strength
