Mayor Bill de Blasio's pledge to settle the wrongful conviction of five men nicknamed the 'Central Park Five' against New York City could cost the city millions of dollars.

Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Kharey 'Khorey' Wise were convicted as teenagers for the 1989 beating and rape of Patricia Meili, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mellis was jogging at the time in Central Park.

The five men were convicted based on their statements to police and before their trials served between 6 3/4 and 13 years in prison, the newspaper says.

Accused rapist Yusef Salaam is seen here being escorted by  police in New York in 1990. Salaam was one of the subjects of the documentary, 'The Central Park Five.' The men's convictions were overturned in 2002 and filed a civil lawsuit against New York City in 2003

The decision was overturned in 2002 when Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist, told authorities he alone attacked Melli. DNA tests confirmedÂ  the sexual assault. Reyes has not been prosecuted because the statute of limitations has passed, the paper reports.

The five men who were convicted for the 1989 attack filed a civil lawsuit against New York City in December 2003, saying they were tricked into making false statements, the Journal reports.

Each of the 'Central Park Five' have 
asked for $50 million, the Journal reports -- but in an analysis of 
other wrongful conviction settlements found that the average payout 
would be about $305,000 for each year in prison.

Using this method, the five men would receive between $2 million and slightly under $4 million each.

The case was litigated for 10 years under then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Journal reports -- and a judge agreed with the city's arguments that the men's statements weren't forced.

The case was also the subject of a 2012 Ken Burns documentary film, 'The Central Park Five.'

In December last year, de Blasio said regarding the case 'a huge injustice was done' and that the settlement would happen 'quickly,' New York Magazine says.

Ronald Kuby, an attorney not affiliated with the case who recently obtained a $2 million wrongful conviction settlement for a Bronx man, told the paper that 'the city actually has a legally viable defense but it's so morally odious.'

'Essentially that [defense] being that "yeah we made a terrible mistake, sorry kids, but nobody intentionally violated your rights,"' Kuby said.
