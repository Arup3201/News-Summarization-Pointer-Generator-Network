Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has conceded that misfiring forward Mario Balotelli doesn't fit into the style of the Reds' current tactical system.

The 24-year-old has scored just two goals in all competitions since joining from AC Milan for £16million in August, and Rodgers' latest admission throws the Italian's future into further doubt.

His Liverpool career hasn't been short of controversy so far, having already served a one-match ban imposed by the Football Association for a social media post which was deemed offensive.  

Mario Balotelli has failed to impress for Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer

The 24-year-old took part in a training session on Wednesday ahead of his side's Boxing Day game at Burnley

Ahead of his side's Boxing Day game at Burnley, Rodgers said: 'I think we've seen that it's not really his game (the 3-4-3 system).

'Having worked with Mario during the time he's been here, we've seen that he's a player who is better in and around the box, so that level of intensity and pressing isn't a part of his game.

'But you try to get the best out of the players that you have, and the qualities that they have, so that's something that we'll focus on.

'The most important thing is that he's now available after his ban. That adds another player to our squad, especially with Fabio Borini not being available because of suspension.' 

Balotelli is available for his side's trip to Turf Moor on Friday, having served his suspension and recovered from a groin problem.

Rodgers' men will be looking for a first Premier League victory in four games against Sean Dyche's men - who will go into the game full of confidence as they look to continue their four-match unbeaten run on home turf.
