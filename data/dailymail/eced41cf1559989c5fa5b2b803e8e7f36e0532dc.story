Trying to remember all the different speed limits and road signs during your driving theory test can stump even the most dedicated of learner drivers.

But one man found himself in a real jam when was arrested by police after he was caught blatantly cheating - by ‘phoning a friend.’ 

The 39-year-old learner driver was sitting the exam at a test centre when staff spotted a Bluetooth earpiece suddenly fall to the floor.

One man was arrested by police after he was caught blatantly cheating - by 'phoning a friend'

Using a hidden mobile phone, the exam candidate had been communicating the theory questions via the Bluetooth to a remote friend.

The friend was then leafing through a copy of the Highway Code, finding the answer to the multiple choice question and then relaying it back to him.

The theory test is made up of a multiple-choice part – which the candidate has 57 minutes to complete and a hazard perception test where 14 one-minute videos are shown and the candidate has to use the mouse on the computer to respond to a series of hazards.

You need to pass both parts to pass the theory test and then have two years to pass the practical driving test. If you fall to pass the practical within two years learners have to re-sit the theory test.

The incident happened during a driving theory test held at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester on Monday shortly before lunchtime.

It is understood he was more than half way through the 50-question theory test when the Bluetooth device flipped out of his ear and fell on the floor.

Shocked staff saw it fall and immediately suspended the theory test and called the police who arrived and then arrested the man.

He was questioned by police and admitted trying to cheat during the theory test and accepted a police caution for carrying an article for the use of fraud.

Under current guidelines the man from Birmingham  – who had no previous convictions – could have faced a maximum 26 week prison sentence for the offence.

Greater Manchester Police City Centre tweeted: ‘Odd arrest yesterday - man sits written driving test with earpiece which allows him to 'phone a friend.' Worst thing was, he failed the test.’ 

Inspector Phil Spurgeon said: ‘His was an audacious attempt to cheat on the driving theory test by using an earpiece to receive the correct answers.

‘However, thanks to the vigilance of staff who saw the device fall on the floor this man was caught red-handed and has subsequently received a police caution.

‘He failed the test because he did not complete the exam which was immediately cancelled. Obviously it was not a particularly sophisticated method of cheating but it should send out a message to anyone considering this that they will be caught and punished.’ 

The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which holds the theory exams, which has a multiple choice section and hazard perception section, in centres across the country including Piccadilly Gardens. Both parts of the test are taken on the same day.
