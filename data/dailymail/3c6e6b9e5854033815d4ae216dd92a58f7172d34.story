School dinners may never be the same again.

The rising cost of potatoes is forcing them from the daily menu. They have more than tripled in price from £91-a-tonne in 2012 to £295 this year, meaning schools can no longer afford to fry, roast or mash them.

So instead of featuring in every meal, potatoes will be served up just two or three times a week in some schools.

Cutbacks: Schoolchildren will be offered rice or noodles as an alternative to potatoes in order to cut costs, Nottingham County Council has said

Rain, snow and ice through one of the
wettest winters and coldest springs on record led to a shortage of 
home-grown potatoes, with imports having to make up the shortfall.

Nottinghamshire County Council 
announced the news yesterday, saying potato dishes in its school dinners
would be replaced by rice and noodles.

A spokesman said school cooks had 
also noticed a downturn in the quality of potatoes. Kevin McKay, the 
council’s head of catering and facilities management, said: ‘The impact 
for school meals has been the rising price of potatoes, especially 
jackets, where wholesale prices have doubled and the quality is poor.

‘Other potatoes used for mashing and roasting are also sometimes poor and cooks have to be selective in what they can use.’

Off the menu: The rising price of potatoes means Nottingham County Council is cutting back on the number of days they will be served up to schoolchildren in the area

Costly: The authority said the measures were being put in place after the cost of potatoes more than tripled in the space of a year

Mr McKay said the situation had ‘put 
pressure on the schools meals service’, which charges £2-a-meal. He said
children had reacted positively to the new recipes which included 
braised rice and oriental noodles.

Some farmers have been forced to 
plant this year’s potato crop a month late because of poor conditions, 
placing even more pressure on last year’s stocks.

The Potato Council says the yield for
2012 was about 20 per cent lower than 2011, and with fewer acres under 
cultivation the total decrease was about 24 per cent.

School dinners are not the only victims of the potato shortage.

Cornish pasty makers have warned the rising cost of potatoes may force them to increase the cost of a pasty as well.

Some
farmers were also forced to plant this year’s crop a month late because
of the poor conditions, placing even more pressure on 2012’s limited 
stocks.

Last week 
Somerset farmer Philip Vaux told the BBC’s Farming Today programme: 
'This season’s crop is well behind last year’s crop which was bad enough
as it was.

'With the 
shortfalls from last year there is bound to be shortages of potatoes, 
whether they come from abroad to fill the gap, that’s going to be for 
quite a considerable time.'

Mr Vaux said he had 'just a few pallets' left at his farm in South Somerset.

One Devon food retailer specialising in jacket potatoes said: 'The price of jacket potatoes has gone through the roof in the last two weeks.

Price rise: Potatoes cost triple the amount per ton today that they did a year ago

'I have never seen the price of raw materials rise as fast as we have seen in the last few weeks.'

However, the Potato Council disputed the council's claim that quality had suffered.

Spokeswoman Caroline Evans said: 'You may notice that potatoes are smaller and have more marks on their skins as a result of growing conditions.

'This should not affect their cooking or eating qualities. We hope that everyone will continue to support the industry in a difficult season.'

The National Farming Union spokesperson for the area, Allison Pratt, said it was concerning that the council - a supporter of local food industries - had decided to make the cuts.

'We know that Nottinghamshire County Council is committed to buying local food so we are disappointed to see that commitment is suffering,' she said.

'We of course, understand that schools have budget concerns.

'If the prices come back down, we hope that Notts County Council will return to their proud suppliers.'

Daniel Moore, business leader at the Becket School in West Bridgford, Nottingham, negotiates catering contracts for the school.

Becket organises its own ingredients budget, and Mr Moore said that the rising price of potatoes had become a concern.

He added: 'There has been a noticeable increase in the price of certain products.

'We have been able to maintain our menu without having to increase the price, and we’re conscious that parents need to able to afford school lunches.'
