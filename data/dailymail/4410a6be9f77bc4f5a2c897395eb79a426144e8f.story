Miley Cyrus could be in the hospital for as long as 27 days.

On Wednesday evening her rep announced the singer is 'devastated' by her severe allergic reaction to cephalexin, an antibiotic that was prescribed for her sinus infection.

The 21-year-old performer will 'remain hospitalized' for an 'indeterminate amount of time,' her team added.

On Thursday the Bangerz singer shared a grainy Instagram photo taken from her hospital bed where she looked depressed. The caption read: 'Over the hospital. I miss #bangerztour #5amhospyselfie so sleeeeepy #medztime #wishicouldcuddlefloyd #whojinxedme.'

after she was forced to cancel her Kansas City concert too.

The Tennessee native revealed the disappointing news on Twitter on Wednesday morning.

'I can't get a hold of my team because it is so early so I want to be the one to tell my fans especially the ones trekking to get there,' Miley wrote.

A statement from Kansas City's Sprint Center arena 
where she was scheduled to perform on Tuesday evening said that Miley 
suffered a 'severe allergic reaction' to antibiotics.

TMZ
 claims that this was the first time Miley has been given a prescription
 for the drug so she was unaware of her allergies to it.

'Kansas I promise Im as [heartbroken] as 
you are. I wanted so badly 2 b there 2night.  Not being with yall makes 
me feel s**ttier than I already do,' Miley tweeted.

She added that she was in good care a few minutes later, although later described hospital TV as 'waccckkkkkk'.

'Mr. Octopussy & some amazing Drs are taking good care of me,' she tweeted along with a selfie from the hospital.

The Bangerz star has previously said in her 2009 memoir that she was born with a hole in her heart and her heart rate 'increases a lot just from going up a flight of stairs'.

InTouch report that Miley suffers from tachyeardia - a faster than normal heartbeat - that could lead to a stroke if the beauty keeps partying the way she has, a doctor told the publication.

It comes after fans in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday were left disappointed when she cancelled just 30 minutes before show time on April 8.

Miley was diagnosed with flu and told to 
rest by doctors, according to a message on the Time Warner Cable arena's
 website but some concertgoers had already arrived for the Bangerz tour 
date before the announcement, only to be turned away.

The singer has been placed on medical rest by doctors, according to the statement, with no indication as yet given when she will resume the tour.

Refunds were being offered at the point of ticket purchase with online and phone orders being automatically refunded.

The singer has been sick lately and tweeted on Sunday and on Monday about flu-like symptoms. It is the latest blow for Miley, who is still grieving the death of her beloved dog Floyd.

The Alaskan Klee Kai is believed to have been attacked by a coyote last week in Los Angeles, while Miley was on tour.
