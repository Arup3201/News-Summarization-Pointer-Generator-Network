Legal woes: Alyza Rachel Russell, 22, was hit with a slew of charges, including two counts of DUI manslaughter, after police say she struck and killed two men while driving her mother's Porsche

A 22-year-old woman from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has been arrested and charged with DUI manslaughter after police say she struck and killed two pedestrians with a Porsche.

Alyza Rachel Russell was taken into custody Wednesday nearly three weeks after the deadly accident that killed 30-year-old Mackendy Jules and 35-year-old Samuel Artez Martindale in a parking lot in downtown Fort Lauderdale.

Investigators say Russell was driving her mother's cherry red 2012 Porsche Panamera west on Broward Boulevard at around 2.15am on June 13 when she lost control of the vehicle while trying to make a left turn on Southwest Fifth Street.

The sports car jumped the curb, plowed through some bushes and careened through the parking lot, mowing down Jules and Martindale. Jules was struck while sitting on the curb, while Martindale was hit as he stood next to his bicycle, Miami Herald reported.

Eyewitnesses say Russell's Porsche ended up dragging Martindale’s body on the ground before the vehicle came to a stop.

Jules was pronounced dead on the scene, while his companion died later that day at Broward General Medical Center, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Another person who was hanging out with Jules and Martindale that night was able to escape the out-of-control vehicle unharmed. Russell and her two passengers also were not injured.

Police officers who arrived on the scene had Russell submit blood samples for testing. A toxicology report later revealed that her blood alcohol level was 0.17 - more than twice the legal limit in Florida.

Russell turned herself in to custody at 7am today and was charged with two counts of DUI manslaughter, two counts of unlawful blood alcohol level manslaughter, one count of DUI property damage and one count of unlawful blood level property damages. 

The driver was ordered held at Broward County Main Jail on $450,000 bond.

During Russell's bond hearing, it was revealed that the woman allegedly told a co-worker after the fatal crash that she was planning to flee to Ireland to escape prosecution.

Aftermath: Martindale was standing next to his bicycle when he was struck by Russell's car, which ended up dragging him through the parking lot

Deadly consequences: Jules was pronounced dead on the scene, while his companion passed away in a hospital later that same day

Her attorney, however, denied the allegations, claiming that his client's family had been planning to go on a vacation abroad, CBS Miami reported.

This is not Russell's first run-in with the law. Records show that she entered a no contest plea in January for a charge of driving without a valid license and without lights. The case stemmed from a June 2012 traffic stop when Russell was behind the wheel of a 2009 Porsche.

The Miami Herald reported that before her Facebook page was deleted in the days after the accident, it listed Russell as a student of international relations at American University in Washington D.C. until 2011. She graduated from Leysin American School in Switzerland in 2009.

NBC Miami reported that the 22-year-old woman has dual citizenship from the U.S. and U.K. Russell's LinkedIn profile states that the woman works as a design assistant at Interiors by Steven G.
