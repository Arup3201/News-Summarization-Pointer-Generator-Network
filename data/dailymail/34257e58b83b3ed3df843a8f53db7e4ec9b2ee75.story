It seems some Australians are getting hot under the collar following the long-awaited release of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' The Movie on our shores. At least in Newcastle.

When one resident from the beachside city north of Sydney returned to her car recently, what she found was much more than a parking ticket.

Reddit Australia user Skwarx was shocked to find a saucy note from a couple looking for 'Fifty Shades' inspired swinging sex along with their contact details.

'50 Shades of Grey. Adult couple seek like minded people for swinging sex.' 

The driver posted the note to the Reddit website with her response: 'Stay classy Spewcastle.'
