Shamed former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was spotted leaving his home early this morning following his early release from jail yesterday.

The ex-Tory communications chief was let out of Hollesley Bay, an open prison in Suffolk, less than five months into an 18-month prison sentence for phone hacking.

He was seen driving his car bright and early this morning as he left his home in Kent, wearing a black coat and blue T-shirt.

A man and woman in a white van arrived at his home yesterday to fit him with an electronic tag, which he must wear as a condition of his early release.

If Coulson fails to stay within the set vicinity of the monitoring device outside curfew hours then police will be alerted and he could be returned to prison.  

He was jailed on July 4 after being found guilty of conspiring to intercept voicemails at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid following an eight-month trial at the Old Bailey.

The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on an individual prisoner but said inmates can be released under home detention arrangements before they have served half of their term.

A spokesman said: 'Public protection is our first priority. Only prisoners who pass a strict risk assessment can be released on home detention curfew (HDC).

'Offenders on HDC are subject to strict licence conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them.'

Prisoners can be considered for HDC if they are serving a sentence of more than three months and less than four years and have served a quarter of their sentence. 

During his trial, a senior judge at the Old Bailey said that he had to take a 'major share of the blame' for the phone hacking at the News of the World, in which the voicemails of thousands of people were unlawfully accessed.

The victims included celebrities, politicians, the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and members of the royal family.

When the defendant returns home from court or prison a supplier will attend the curfew address to install the monitoring equipment during curfew hours.

They will fit  a transmitter device, the tag, to the defendant - around their ankle. 

The supplier will also install a receiver device, the monitoring unit, in a suitable location in the property. 

The tag sends radio signals to the monitoring unit at frequent intervals, typically once every 30 seconds or so. 

The two devices are calibrated so that if the defendant leaves the curfew address the signal from the tag no longer reaches the monitoring unit.

The monitoring unit stores the signals from the tag and transmits them to a monitoring centre staffed by the supplier’s employees.

Coulson, 46, initially spent two months in Category A Belmarsh prison, in south London, alongside terrorists and other dangerous inmates – longer than is usual for a crime such as hacking.

He was then moved to Hollesley Bay, a minimum security jail in Suffolk.

The 421-inmate Category D prison which is spread over 85 acres is often nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its sea views and easy-going regime.

Coulson was housed in a cell in the prison's Hoxon induction unit which is also where shamed Tory Lord Jeffrey Archer served his sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice following a News of the World sting.

Other inmates said Coulson had been given a job in the prison as an education orderly which involved being a classroom assistant, helping to educate prisoners. 

Millionaire author Archer who was released in 2003 worked in the prison library.

Many of the prisoners have jobs outside the prison in places like factories and charity shops, but it is believed that Coulson was considered too high-profile to work in the local community

There was a mixed response from prisoners about how well regarded Coulson was at the jail.

One inmate said: 'Most prisoners just ignored him. What his newspaper did, hacking the phones of dead people, was bang out of order. There are plenty of criminals here, but we have some morals.'

Another prisoner said: 'He was a fantastic chap who was always friendly and had the time to talk to anyone. He had a job in the classroom and he helped a lot of people.

'He had what was considered as quite a nice job in the prison. But it suited his skills. He was certainly was not given any special treatment.

'Apart from working, he volunteered as a mentor, helping individual prisoners to learn how to read and write. It was a pleasure to do time with him.

'He kept quite active and took part in a variety of sports including badminton. I wish him all the best for the future.' 

Coulson's sentence has been calculated under a complicated set of rules known as the Home Detention Curfew Scheme.

The 46-year-old left Hollesley Bay, an open prison in Suffolk, yesterday and must now wear an electrnoic tag

This allows non-violent inmates sentenced to 18 months or more to spend the last 135 days or less at home, wearing a tag.

In Coulson's case, his 18-month sentence was halved – as happens in all bar the most serious cases - then had the further reduction made under HDC rules.

However, his ordeal will not be at an end when he leaves open prison.

In August, prosecutors in Scotland announced he faces a series of perjury charges over the Tommy Sheridan trial.

Coulson is alleged to have lied while giving evidence at the trial in December 2010.

He is accused of knowing there was a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World while he was editor but denying it while on oath.

Following his conviction in July, the Prime Minister apologised for hiring Coulson as a Tory spin doctor and, later, the communications chief at Number Ten.

David Cameron said it was 'the wrong decision'.
