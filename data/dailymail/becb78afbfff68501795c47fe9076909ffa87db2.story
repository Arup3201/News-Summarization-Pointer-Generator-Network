Lance Armstrong let his long-term girlfriend lie to police that she was behind the wheel after he hit two parked cars following night of partying in Aspen, according to authorities.

Police have now cited Armstrong after the December 28 hit-and-run, but only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, admitted to lying for him to avoid national attention.

Hansen told them she had been driving home from a party when she lost control of Armstrong's SUV, hitting the cars, according to police.

But Hansen eventually told officers Armstrong was driving, and they both decided to let her take the blame.

According to the Apsen Daily Times, the 43-year-old has now been issued with two traffic citations - failing to report an accident and exceeding safe speed. 

They had initially been given to Hansen, the mother of two of his children, Maxwell and Olivia.

Aspen police detective Rick Magnuson wrote in his report that Hansen told them she had driven home from a party at Aspen Art Museum because 'Lance had a little bit to drink so I was driving. I was not drinking.'

She told him she lost control of the car and hit parked cars on West Francis Street, but spoke to the homeowner, telling him she would pay for the damage.

The West End homeowner said: 'A woman, well-dressed, 30ish, blond … came running around the corner in her high heels in 6 inches of packed snow, which was pretty impressive; she ran directly to us and said, "We’re so sorry, we came around the corner and slipped on the ice, and we hit your cars."'

“She said, ‘I’m Anna, we’re the Armstrongs, my husband’s Lance, he was just driving too fast around the corner or something,’” the report states. 

The homeowner informed police and although they wrote Hanson the tickets, they remained suspicious and spoke to the valet at the St. Regis Aspen Resort - he  said he had assisted Hansen to the passenger side of the GMC.

Hansen was called to the courthouse and she admitted that Armstrong had been driving.

The police report states she denied Armstrong asked her to cover, insisting it was a 'joint decision.'

'We’ve had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and honestly, I’ve got teenagers, I just wanted to protect my family because I thought, "Gosh, Anna Hansen hit some cars, it’s not going to show up in the papers, but Lance Armstrong hit some cars, it’s going to be a national story,'" she said.

Deputy district attorney Andrea Bryan said Hansen was not charged with making a false report to police because she was cooperative. 

The disgraced cyclists was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles after taking banned substances

Armstrong, who is due in court March 17, declined immediate comment, and his attorney didn't immediately return a call.

He met Hansen in July 2008 through his charity work.

Lance was previously married to Kristin Richard, whom he shares three children with, before divorcing in 2003.

He then famously dated Cheryl Crowe soon after, announcing their engagement in 2005 before ultimately splitting in 2006. 

Armstrong then moved onto a high profile relationship with Kate Hudson.

 Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. 

Those titles were stripped after a report by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed the use of performance enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates.
