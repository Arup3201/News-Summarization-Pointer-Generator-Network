Rush Limbaugh has apologised for calling a college student a 'slut' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers' contraception.

The controversial radio host's comments, which included a suggestion that Sandra Fluke should make a sex tape, caused a row which saw him abandoned by advertisers and even drew in Barack Obama.

But today he acknowledged that he 'chose the wrong words' while trying to 'illustrate the absurd with absurdity', and insisted: 'I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.'

Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance

Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls 
for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually 
promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have
 forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their 
employees.

But instead he dialed up the 
rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke should film herself having sex and 
then claiming that she 'had boyfriends lined up around the block'.

However, after three companies pulled
 their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to
 express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday 
afternoon, three days after his initial remarks.

His apology read: 'For over 20 years,
 I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five 
days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of 
the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.'

He went on to argue that 'personal 
sexual recreational activities' should not enter the public sphere, as 
this undermines notions of 'personal responsibility and accountability'.

Mr Limbaugh concluded: 'In my 
monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what
 is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that 
should reach a Presidential level.

'My choice of words was not the best,
 and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I 
sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.'

Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show

Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show

Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments'

On his radio show yesterday, the 
61-year-old defended his comments  and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke 
'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my
 day'.

He said: 'She's
 having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried 
here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the 
truth.'

'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch'

Rush Limbaugh

On Friday three
 advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show 
after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious 
institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said 
in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever 
happens.

Mattress retailers Sleep Train 
and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all 
bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on 
the show.

‘We don't condone negative comments 
directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you 
for your concern and input.’

'Recent
 comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number
 spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all 
advertising on that program.'

A QuickenLoans spokesman
 said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable 
feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush 
Limbaugh.'

Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will 
're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it 
will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’.

Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college
Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying 
woman should get the pill for medical reasons.

And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.'

Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'

Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments

Mr Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'.

'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'.

'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways 
is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when
 it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her 
views.'

More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has 
also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with 
Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'.

When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.'

Mr Limbaugh
 said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth 
control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes 
her a prostitute. She wants
 to be paid to have sex.

‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’

Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh.

'My reaction was the reaction
 a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these 
types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.'

Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so

Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage

Ms Fluke was due to testify at a 
hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that 
health insurers provide contraception.

But committee chairman Darrell Issa of
 California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused 
on threats to religious freedom.

Ms Fluke later put her testimony on 
YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a
 disorder that caused ovarian cysts.

The friend subsequently lost her 
ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, 
which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh.

Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News.

‘Three thousand dollars for birth 
control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us 
to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said.

'She's having so much sex she can't 
afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should 
provide them, or the Pope.’

Female rights activists were left 
seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last 
month after it was led by an all-male panel.

Ms Fluke did eventually speak about 
birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy
 Pelosi last week, reported ABC News.

She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university.

Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

But he has faced attacks of his own to
 deal with this week - after a survey of American viewers found he was 
their least-liked news personality.
