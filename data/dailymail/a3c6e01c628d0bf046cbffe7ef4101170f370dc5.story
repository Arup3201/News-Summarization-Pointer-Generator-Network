A fisherman freed a turtle from a ginormous abandoned net that was capturing endless marine life off the Northern Territory coast.

Darwin fisherman, Ian Johnson, discovered the estimated one-tonne 'ghost net' floating off the Cobourg Peninsula - 350 km east of Darwin while he was on a week - long fishing trip.

The massive net had trapped so many sea creatures that Mr Johnson described the putrid stench as smelling of 'death'.

Darwin fisherman, Ian Johnson, freed the turtle from a ginormous abandoned net that was capturing endless marine life off the Northern Territory coast

Mr Johnson was with his wife, Elshonner, and a friend Brooke Summers when they came across the turtle trapped in the huge net off the Cobourg Peninsula - 350 km east of Darwin

The trio managed to free the turtle by cutting the net it was entwined in with a large knife

The net is estimated at weighing one tonne

Mr Johnson was with his wife, Elshonner, and a friend Brooke Summers, when they came across the net that he said was a least 10 metres deep.

'We could see turtles flapping in it, chunks of fish in there,' he told the ABC.

'Eventually there was a big shark come in to get a feed of broken-up bits of barracuda and what not.'

The trio managed to free a distressed and frightened trapped turtle by cutting the net it was entwined in with a large knife.

'Got to stop the netting - what do you reckon little fella? Bet you want it stopped too,' Mr Johnson can be heard in the saying to the frightened creature in the video footage.

'Not to mention all of the other fish caught in this that are dying and rotting.' 

The rescue only took abut 20 seconds before the turtle was relieved to be set free back into the ocean. 

The distressed and frightened turtle was quickly released from the netting

This fella was a lucky one as many other creatures had died after being caught up in the abandoned net

The effort to remove the ghost net wasn't so seamless as it took a ranger boat plus two Australian customs vessels to detach it from the ocean floor and onto to a boat ramp where it was left to dry out before it will be burnt.

'We could smell a bit of death in there as well,' Mr Johnson said to the ABC.

'There were a lot of little crabs, and some turtle shells. There were three or four other turtles in there. It must have been floating for a while.'
