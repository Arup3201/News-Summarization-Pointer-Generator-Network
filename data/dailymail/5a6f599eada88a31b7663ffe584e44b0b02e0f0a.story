The use of e-cigarettes in public places in England could be outlawed.

The devices could be banned from offices and other public spaces under plans being considered by Public Health England.

The minutes from one of the organisation’s meetings reveal concerns that they could ‘renormalise smoking’.

Public Health England is considering banning e-cigarettes from public places in England

The minutes also contain a recommendation that e-cigarettes should be banned to prevent them ‘undermining smoking prevention’, The Times reports.

But Public Health England says banning the use of e-cigarettes in public places is just one possibility that is being considered - and it is far from certain that it will happen.

The news comes just days after New York and Chicago banned the cigarettes from public places.

On Tuesday regulations were changed to mean that in these cities, e-cigarettes now fall under the same set of regulations as tobacco cigarettes.

As a result, they can no longer be used in bars, restaurants and other public places - including parks.

However, many experts do not believe England should follow New York in increasing regulations on e-cigarettes.

This is 
because new research by the health charity Ash has revealed that barely 
any non-smokers are taking up the habit by smoking e-cigarettes.

The
 study showed that almost all of the people who smoke them are doing so 
in a bid to say off tobacco - meaning the devices could actually have a 
positive impact on public health.

On Tuesday new regulations came in in New York which mean smoking e-cigarettes is now not permitted in the city's bars, restaurants or parks

Almost two-thirds of people who smoke them also smoke normal cigarettes while most of the rest are ex-smokers.

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash said: 'The dramatic rise in use of electronic cigarettes over the past four years suggests that smokers are increasingly turning to these devices to help them cut down or quit smoking. Significantly, usage among non-smokers remains negligible.

'While it is important to control the advertising of electronic cigarettes to make sure children and non-smokers are not being targeted, there is no evidence from our research that e-cigarettes are acting as a gateway into smoking.'

Professor Robert West, who led the study, added: 'Despite claims that use of electronic cigarettes risks renormalising smoking, we found no evidence to support this view.

‘On the contrary, electronic cigarettes may be helping to reduce smoking as more people use them as an aid to quitting.'

The director-general of the Institute of Economic Affairs is also against the idea of banning e-cigarettes.

Mark Littlewood told The Times: ‘We have found potentially the best lifesaving alternative there is to the smoking of tobacco.

‘E-cigarettes are a lifestyle product and a life-saving product and my concern is that public health bureaucrats are now more interested in whether there should be a cultural norm of individuals putting small cylindrical devices between their lips than whether the consequences of doing so are life-threatening.’

For now, there are no immediate plans for a ban to be put in place.

Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England said: 'We have not called for a ban on e-cigarette use in public spaces.

'PHE is working with our partners to consider the options for supporting safe use of e cigarettes to reduce harm and support smokers to quit, some of which were discussed by our board in February.'
