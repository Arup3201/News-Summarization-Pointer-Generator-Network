Self-confessed film hater Michael Owen wound up watching just his eighth ever movie as he tried to stave off boredom on a flight home from China.

The former England striker told followers on Twitter of his film-watching habits, using the hashtag '#HateFilms' on the long plane journey back from Asia.

'Watched my eighth ever film on the flight home. Must have been bored. #HateFilms,' Owen said, before revealing the list of eight films he claimed to have been forced to watch.

Classics including Rocky, Heat, Ghost, Jurassic Park, Cool Runnings, Seabiscuit, Karate Kid and Forest Gump all made it into Owen's cinematic hall of shame. 

In August the former Manchester United and Liverpool forward told The Guardian: 'I don’t watch films. I think I’ve seen about five in my life. I just can’t get into them.

'I do try – someone will say, "Watch this film, it’s great," and I’ll try but after half an hour, 40 minutes I can’t take it any longer.

Owen was out in China Shanghai School Football League as part of his role as an ambassador of the Shanghai School Football League.
