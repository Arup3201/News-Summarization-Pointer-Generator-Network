A crying two-month-old baby has been pulled from the rubble in the war-battered city of Aleppo in Syria after being trapped for a staggering 16 hours.

Mahmud Ibildi was heard crying from beneath a bomb-struck building last night as daily air strikes continue to batter the capital. 

Finally, after an intricate rescue mission, Civil Defence workers managed to pull the little boy free - kissing him with delight.

Miracle: This is the moment two-month-old Mahmud was pulled from beneath a crumbling building in Aleppo 

The incredible moment was captured in a video that appeared and Twitter and shows tireless rescue workers shouting 'it's a miracle' as a small head is seen emerging from debris.

A man is captured moving rocks with his hands to get to the tiny baby boy who can be heard wailing from behind the crumbled wall.

He slowly tugs on Mahmud's babygro and as his bloodied and dusty head comes into view another man reaches into the hole and protects the baby's head from the sharp rubble.

He is heard crying as his whole body, completely covered in dust, is carefully extracted.

A smiling man then clutches the rescued child in his arms while his colleagues off-camera cry: 'God is great!'

Relief: Tireless rescue workers screamed 'God is great!' as they lifted up crumbling walls to save Mahmud

Shaken: His mother Umm Mahmud was relieved but shaken sitting with her baby boy after he was rescued

The child's mother was also reportedly rescued.

'After 16 hours working under difficult conditions, the civil defence in Ansari (in southern Aleppo) was able to rescue a baby  barely two months old as well as her mother who was injured,' a commentary to the video said.

The video was posted by a rescue team working in a rebel-held area of the northern city.

Overjoyed: A smiling man then clutches the child in his arms while his colleagues off-camera cry: 'God is great!'

It was impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the 30-second clip or where it was shot.

It was posted by a group calling itself the 'Aleppo Civil Defence'.

Daily air strikes by regime forces have killed hundreds of people in rebel-held parts of the city, drawing international condemnation.

Rebels constantly fire mortar bombs at government-controlled western sectors of Aleppo, which was Syria's commercial hub before its civil war erupted in 2011.
