Jude Law is the epitome of Hollywood heartthrob for an entire generation of women, but the 40-year-old actor's good looks are in jeopardy as his hair loss accelerates.

Now a leading hair loss expert has said Jude needs to 'do a Rooney' if he is to avoid going completely bald at the front of his scalp very soon.

The screen hunk was pictured on Monday night showing the advanced stages of male pattern baldness.

Jude appears to be losing his hair at a rapid rate and the difference is stark compared to the plentiful locks he had previously

Jude's hair loss may become too large to fix if he waits much longer to tackle it, according to an expert

And unless he has a hair transplant he will be completely bald around his hairline in five years, says surgeon Asim Shahmalak from the TV show Embarrassing Bodies.

Law, who turned 40 last December, had just a small tuft of hair at the front of his scalp when he was pictured last night after starring in a one-off play in London's West End to raise money for autism.

Dr Shahmalak said the Sherlock Holmes star urgently need to take action.

He said: 'Jude is already showing fairly advances stages of male pattern baldness.

'You can see he has lost nearly all his hair from above his temples and now just has a small tuft of hair at the front of his scalp.

'He will need a fairly large medical procedure to sort it out.

'If he has does not take action in the next few years, he will also lose this tuft and be completely bald at the front of his head.

'His problem could be easily remedied with a hair transplant.

'Hair would be taken from the back of his head and replanted around the temples to fill out his hairline.

'It is a similar procedure to those undergone by Wayne Rooney.

'If Jude leaves it any longer, the bald patch will be too large to fix.

'The transplanted hair will be permanent and last him for life.'

Dr Shahmalak - who has performed hair transplants on a string of celebrities - said Law needed to act to maintain his heart-throb status.

He said: 'Jude is a fine actor but the reason why he is a household name is because he is so handsome.

Manchester United player Wayne Rooney famously underwent a hair transplant to combat his hair loss

'How many leading Hollywood men whose appeal is heavily linked to their good looks are bald. Not many.

'Jude is simply not going to get those leading roles without addressing issues with his hair.

'In short, he needs to 'do a Rooney'.'

Law has been appearing to try and cover up his baldness for years.

He famously appeared on the Graham 
Norton Show wearing a beanie and he is often seen sporting a beard - 
possibly growing facial hair to compensate for his hair loss on top.

Other
leading Hollywood stars have taken medical action to combat their 
baldness including Kevin Spacey, 53,  was pictured wearing a hairpiece 
at the Australian Open in Melbourne in January after previously being 
pictured showing noticeable hair loss.

The actor appears to have been trying to hide his hair loss for some time (left at the premier of Sherlock Holmes in 2011, and right in 2007) and even appeared on the Graham Norton Show wearing a beanie

Dr Shahmalak performed two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies presenter Christian Jessen (right), and on presenter Martin Roberts, 49, star of BBC1's Homes Under The Hammer (left)

Dr Shahmalak has performed two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies presenter Christian Jessen, who, like Law, suffered appreciable hair loss around his temples.

Jessen, 36, said the procedures - done four years apart and costing £5,500 each - changed his life.

Dr Jessen said: 'I felt so much more confident afterwards.'

Dr Shahmalak also carried out a hair transplant on presenter Martin Roberts, 49, star of BBC1's Homes Under The Hammer.

Roberts said he had the hair transplant because he hated seeing his bald crown on TV.

He
said: 'I'm so glad I had it done. The transplant changed my life. I 
thought I could have a new car or cure my baldness. It was an easy 
decision to make.'

Law was pictured showing his baldness at Apollo Theatre in London, with just a small tuft of hair at the front of his scalp
