James Kew was killed when he came into contact with the cable which completed an 11,000 volt electrical circuit with the ground causing electricity to shoot through his body

A scientist died in a freak accident when he touched a power cable while out running.

James Kew, 41, was leading members of a running club through a cornfield when he came into contact with the  end of the 11,000-volt cable, which had come loose from a telegraph pole.

It was hanging around 4ft from the ground and may have been concealed by a bush or tree.

The discharge of electricity caused the surrounding ground to catch fire.

Two other runners suffered shocks as they tried to help their friend, who died just two days before his birthday.

Mr Kew, 41, who was a top biologist within the research department at GlaxoSmithKline, is believed to have died instantly following the incident at about 8.40pm last night near Debden Road in Newport, Essex.

Dr Kew suffered severe burns and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Dr Kew was a regular runner, competing in races in the local area, and was also a member of the Bishop's Stortford hockey club.

aramedics were at the field in Newport, near Saffron Walden, Essex, within minutes but were unable to reach Dr Kew for around two hours until the power was isolated, although he is thought to have died before they arrived.

Dr Kew, who is understood to have had a son with his wife  Sarah, lived in the picturesque  village of Ashdon.

He was a director of biology at the Centre of Excellence for External Drug Discovery, a research department at Britain’s biggest drugs company, GlaxoSmithKline.

He previously held a senior position at the company’s Central Nervous System Drug Discovery Unit, and had a BSc in biological sciences from Exeter University and a PhD in developmental sciences from Cambridge University.

Mrs Kew was unavailable to  comment yesterday.

Tragedy: The jogger was killed after coming into contact with a high voltage cable after fell down in a field

Saffron Striders chairman Nigel Coates said: 'James joined us in 2010 and soon became an established club runner.

He clearly had a natural aptitude for the sport and went on to compete with the club in various competitions and races.

Dr Kew, pictured with his running club earlier this year, was an avid jogger who competed in this year's London Marathon

'His greatest achievement during his time with the Striders was no doubt at this year’s London Marathon.
It was the first marathon he had ever run and he had predicted he would
finish in what would have been an excellent time of three and a half 
hours.

'In fact, on the day he completed the
race in an astonishing three hours five minutes, which made him the 
first Strider to finish and in a time that really was testament to just 
how good a runner he was.

'James was quiet and unassuming and a very popular member of the Striders who will be deeply missed.
Everyone at the club is absolutely devastated by James’ death and our 
thoughts go to his family at this incredibly difficult time.

'We would like to thank the emergency services who attended the scene last night.'

In a message on the club's website said: 'It is with the deepest regret that we have 
to announce the death of James Kew, as a result of a tragic accident 
while out running.
'Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family at this very difficult time.'

A
spokesman from GlaxoSmithKline said: 'We have been informed of this 
tragic event and our thoughts are with the friends and family of the man
who died.'

One man said he saw the cable hanging earlier in the day.

Peter Ascot, who lives in Newport, was out walking with a group of 10 at about 6.30pm yesterday.

He said: 'We saw the cable hanging low and almost touching the wheat. We all remarked on it at the time.

'I
woke up this morning and saw what happened. I feel absolutely dreadful 
that I didn't report it - you can't help feeling you could have done 
more. It's unbelievable this has happened. It's absolutely devastating.'

Evidence: Investigators take pictures of where the cable collapsed and right, police have to seal off the field

Death: The burned patch of ground near the field of wheat. The jogger was with at least two others at the time

Dr Kew finished 33rd in this year's Hatfield Broad Oak 10k out of a field of more than 1,000 in a time of 37min 38sec.

One online tribute to Dr Kew read: 
'tragic news about @StortfordHockey player James Kew: a lovely guy and 
good hockey player. Thoughts are with the Kew family.'

Another friend wrote: 'Very sad news 
about 4th XI and Vets player James Kew who sadly died in a freak 
accident whilst running yesterday. Condolences to Kew family.'

Dr Kew joined the Centre of 
Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) in 2010 as a Director of 
Biology, which is a research department at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

Before joining the CEEDD, he spent 
eight years working within GSK's Central Nervous System (CNS) drug 
discovery unit, most recently as Director of Molecular & Cellular 
Biology within the Schizophrenia & Cognitive Disorders Discovery 
Performance Unit.

Dr Kew was a regular runner, competing in races in the local area, and was also a member for the Bishop's Stortford hockey club. Power cables can be seen hanging down in the field

A piece of cable is photographed lying on the ground and only two of the three power cables hung overhead

This morning a police officer stood 
watch at edge of the field where the incident happened. An area about 
half a mile from the nearest road was cordoned off.

Pieces of cable were still visible 
laying in the field and only two of the usual three power cables hung 
overhead. There was no sign of a large fire, with an area roughly two square metres seemingly affected.

Police have launched a joint 
investigation with Essex County Fire and Rescue Service and the Health and 
Safety Executive has been informed.

A fire service spokesman said: 'Crews 
arriving at the scene requested the attendance of an ambulance for one 
male casualty suffering severe burns.

'The electricity board was called to isolate power to the cable and at 9.52pm firefighters were standing by as disconnection took place. This has been confirmed as a fatal incident.

'A joint police and fire service investigation will be carried out.'

A spokesman for UK Power Networks 
refused to comment on reports locally that the low hanging cable had 
been reported earlier in the evening.

The spokesman said: 'Our engineers were
called to an incident at Saffron Walden last night and are currently 
helping with an investigation.

'Our thoughts at this time are with the family and friends of a man who died and also our employees who helped at the scene.'
