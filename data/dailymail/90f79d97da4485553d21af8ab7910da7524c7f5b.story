This is where Abu Hamza may get his just deserts.

Standing miles from anywhere, the bleak fortress-like super-prison dubbed the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' is the place the hate preacher is expected to die behind bars.

ADX Florence in Fremont 
Country, Colorado, houses the most dangerous inmates in the U.S. prison 
system and is believed to the world's most secure prison.

Hamza is expected to be handed a life term after his convictions for a string of terror offences. The
 hook-handed Islamist cleric – who for years spouted evil on the streets of Britain – was convicted by a New York court of 11 charges after a 
five-week trial.

The firebrand, 56, who was tried under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, had denied helping to organise a hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 when three Britons were killed. He is currently awaiting sentencing.

However, Hamza is expected to apply within weeks to be moved to a cushy U.S. medical prison serve his life sentence. He wants to be transferred to the Federal Medical Centre in Devens, Massachusetts, where he will have access to a craft room and a music practice room.He will also be able to take continuing education classes or play hockey - and even study culinary arts.

The application for the move will be put in by Hamza’s lawyers on the grounds that his disability - he has stumps for arms and only one eye - means he needs preferential treatment.

The proper name for the prison in Florence is the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility. It is currently home to 490 convicted terrorists, gang leaders and neo-Nazis. Many have been transferred from other prisons after killing inmates or prison staff.

They include Richard Reid, the attempted shoe bomber; Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th 9/11 hijacker; and al-Qaeda terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1993 and the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.

It has been suggested Egyptian-born Hamza may have come across his new neighbours before. He led the Finsbury Park Mosque in London in the 1990s, which was reportedly attended by both Moussaoui and Reid, but denied ever having met them.

Hamza is likely to go to H-unit, home to a number of Islamist terrorists and Robert Hanssen, a FBI agent serving a life sentence for passing secrets to Russia. Some have held hunger strikes.

D-unit houses home-grown terrorists including Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, and Eric Rodolph, who bombed the Atlanta Olympics.

The prison was built after the murder of 
two prison officers at a high security prison in Marion, Illinois. The 
perimeter of the 35-acre site is guarded by 12ft high razor wire fences,
 laser-beams, pressure pads and attack dogs. No-one has ever escaped.

Inmates are kept in cells measuring 
7ft by 12ft for 23 hours a day. The bed, desk and stool are immovable 
and cast from poured concrete. The cells also feature shower cubicals 
and a toilet.

A black and 
white television provides classes, religious services and fifty channels
 of broadcasting. Each cell has a slit window with a view onto an inner 
courtyard and a patch of sky. Each inmate gets a copy of USA Today, with
 certain articles cut out.

Inmates
 can play games of bingo alone in their cells. The winners get chocolate
 bars, or the right to have their picture taken and sent to their 
family.

Wardens have previously told the 
European Convention on Human Rights that daily exercise is taken in pens measuring 12ft by 20ft, 
containing pull-up bars and footballs. Prisoners are allowed to talk to 
each other between pens, or through the ventilation grills in their 
cells.

Indoor exercise is held alone in a windowless hall with a vaulted ceiling, likened to an empty swimming pool.

A former hostage kidnapped by Jihadists in Yemen said today that hate preacher Abu Hamza's conviction was 'justice' for his role that left four hostages dead.

Eric Firkins was part of a group of 16 western tourists taken at gunpoint 16 years ago.

Three Britons and an Australian died when Yemeni forces rescued the hostages and the New York jury heard the radical preacher at Finsbury Park Mosque had been in contact with the kidnappers.

It is claimed Abu Hamza had been hoping to exchange the hostages for his son, stepson and several other British radicals arrested days earlier in Yemen.

Speaking from his south London home Mr Firkins said: 'I am very pleased justice has been done. Anyone that has done what he has done must be evil.

'I don't want people in our country to tolerate what he has committed, he preached hatred against the English and he did it openly and felt free to carry out acts of terror.

'It's justice. I don't want to judge anyone but I judge the bad acts he has done.'

Laurence Whitehouse, who was among the hostages and whose wife, Margaret, was one of the Britons shot dead, spoke of his relief at the court's decision.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'This has taken a long time, even though there was evidence of his involvement early on. We could have had less trouble and strife in the world if effective action had been taken against him earlier.'

Better behaved prisoners are granted extra privileges, with the best behaved given five hours of phone calls a month and the right to eat together out of their cells.

The five extradited men will be allowed to see the imam four times a week. The library holds 158 Arabic books and 320 videos and DVDs on Islam. They will have the right to pray in their cells and have prayer beads, rugs and headgear. Inmates can also use a law library for two hours a day.

Following Hamza's conviction, British Prime Minister David Cameron today pledged to 'take more steps' to speed up the deportation of people who pose a threat to his country.

Mr Cameron said it was 'good that he has faced justice' and insisted he would take action to speed up the extradition process if his Conservative Party remains in government next year.

Mr Cameron told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it's good that he has faced justice and justice has been done. I think we should reflect on whether we can extradite faster.

'I think Theresa May, the Home Secretary, did a brilliant job. It took 10 years but Abu Hamza, off to America, and, of course, Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan.

'We have made progress in a way no government before us has made progress and we should be clear that we have got a good domestic record in terms of prosecuting and convicting people who are guilty of terrorist offences here in Britain.'

He added: 'I think speeding up extradition and speeding up deportation... I think we need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly, and we have made changes there.

'Obviously, we also need to look, as I've said many times, at the European Convention on Human Rights and the position that we have got to get into where, if someone threatens our country, we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential that we restore that.

'We have taken some big steps but I plan to take more steps if I'm elected as a Conservative Prime Minister after the next election.'
