The death of the former Prime Minister has divided 
opinion and while many have mourned, some of her enemies have revelled in the news.

Eighties Trotskyist firebrand Derek Hatton, a fierce opponent of Mrs Thatcher from his days as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council said it was a 'pity she had ever been born.'

George Galloway has announced that he is refusing to attend the parliamentary tributes tomorrow and a Labour MP said he would not attend due to a dentist appointment.

Controversial: Eighties Trotskyist firebrand Derek Hatton, was a fierce opponent of Mrs Thatcher from his days as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council

Mr Hatton, a former Deputy Labour Leader of Liverpool City Council, said:
'I am certainly not going to join in the many people who are saying 
that they are glad that a human being has died.

'But what I would say though is that it is a pity she was ever born, and I regret that Thatcherism ever came about,' he said.

'The harm that she did in the country and particularly in this city was massive and I don’t think anyone will ever forget that.'

Yesterday he sent one particularly vile message reading: ‘The issue isn’t about whether she is now dead, I regret for the sake of millions of people that she was ever born.’

Meanwhile George Galloway has said he

tomorrow, claiming debate is 'not allowed'.

Decision: George Galloway has said he will not be taking part in Parliamentary tributes to Baroness Thatcher tomorrow, claiming debate is 'not allowed'

The
Respect MP, who yesterday sparked anger by tweeting 'Tramp the dirt 
down' after Lady Thatcher's death, said he would be 'first in the queue'
if debate was allowed.

But
'the House of Commons authorities' would not allow debate in tomorrow's
session, which has been called during Easter recess, Mr Galloway 
claimed.

Asked if he would be attending, he said: 'I understand it is not a debate, so no.

'If it were a debate about the legacy of Margaret Thatcher I would be first in the queue for prayers.

'It is a state-organised eulogy.'

Speaking from the Netherlands, Mr Galloway claimed dissent or debate was 'not allowed' during the Commons session.

'It is not allowed, it is not a debate,' he said.

Asked
where he had heard that debate was prohibited, he said 'from the 
horse's mouth in the House of Commons authorities', but refused to go 
into details.

'It is a 
series of tributes at public expense - vast public expense if everyone 
turns up,' Mr Galloway said. 'It is enough to make you sick.

A large number of Labour MPs are expected to attend the Commons to pay tribute to Baroness Thatcher, a senior party source said.

The source said: 'We expect large numbers of Labour MPs to attend what will be a major parliamentary occasion.

Reaction: Anne Scargill, the former wife of Arthur Scargill who led the miners during strike action said she was 'happy' to hear about Margaret Thatcher's death, calling her an 'evil' woman

'Ed
Miliband made clear his position yesterday. Lady Thatcher was a huge 
figure in British politics and the world stage. While she might have 
been a controversial figure, we respect her personal achievements and 
political strength.'

Labour MP John Mann, who represents the 
former mining community of Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said he would 
not attend Parliament tomorrow as he would be at the dentist.

He said: 'I would have done it on 
Monday when Parliament reassembles. I do not know why we are wasting 
taxpayers' money on an additional session.

Critical: Music star Morrissey, a long-time critic of Baroness Thatcher, berated her as 'barbaric' and 'without an atom of humanity'

Baroness Thatcher's death could propel The Wizard Of Oz track Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead into the top 40 of the singles chart.

In the space of less than 12 hours Judy Garland's version had made it to number 54 according to the latest sales figures collated for the Official Charts Company. It is expected to climb higher as a result of a Facebook campaign being set up to encourage sales.

There has been some speculation that it may be too short to qualify at just 51 seconds, but chart bosses say it is eligible. In 2007 the track

The Ladies Bras by Wisbey made the chart despite lasting just 36 seconds. Garland's version is not the only one to be selling.

A performance by Ella Fitzgerald is at 146 and one by the Munchkins is at 183. If sales of the three versions had been combined it would be selling strongly enough to be at number 40.

The Official Charts Company will release its midweek sales tomorrow to give an indication of whether it is continuing to sell and the top 40 itself will be announced on Sunday.Garland's version is also at number 16 in the iTunes chart today.

'It is perfectly valid that, when a prime minister dies, MPs can pay tribute, but this could be perfectly properly done on Monday.'

Ex-miners will next week mark the 20 years since their pit closed, with a party - on the day of Baroness Thatcher's funeral.

Alan Cummings, chairman of the Durham Miners' Association, said the timing of the events was 'remarkable' and 'one of those quirks', though he added: 'She couldn't be cremated on a better day.'

The party will be held on Wednesday at the Easington Colliery Club, in the former pit village, subject to the committee's approval, he said.

On Tuesday evening there will be another party for the women's groups who supported the striking miners, he said.

The pit in Easington Colliery, which was the setting for the film Billy Elliott, closed in 1993, with the loss of 1,400 jobs and it is one of the most deprived parts of the country.

Of Wednesday's event, Mr Cummings said: 'We are planning to have a colliery band and we are inviting ex-miners and their families to go back over their memories of the strike and what has happened since the closure of the pit.'

Mr Cummings, an ex-NUM Lodge secretary, said the event was not in poor taste and he had only received positive feedback.

'I couldn't stand her,' he said of Baroness Thatcher.

'She had a very patronising manner and I could have put my foot through the television whenever I saw her on there.

'We opposed and hated everything she did. She has wrecked thousands and thousands of lives so, no, it's not in poor taste.

'We can understand why people are happy and rejoicing that she has gone because they remember these communities have never recovered.'

Anne Scargill, the former wife of Arthur Scargill who led the miners during strike action in the 1980s, told Daybreak she was 'happy' to hear about Margaret Thatcher's death, calling her an 'evil' woman.

She said: '[Thatcher] was intent on smashing the trade unions, and in it she smashed the country.

'She called us the enemy within, there were only one enemy within and that were her.'

Music star Morrissey, a long-time critic of Baroness Thatcher, berated her as 'barbaric' and 'without an atom of humanity'.

The former Smiths singer has often aired his thoughts about his dislike of the former Prime Minister through song - with tracks such as Margaret On The Guillotine - and in interviews.

And as many found some admirable qualities in her years of political life, Morrissey found no positive achievements in her premiership.

He claimed she was 'charged by negativity' and said she 'closed' rather than opened the doors for women as the first female PM.

In a statement he said: 'Thatcher is remembered as The Iron Lady only because she possessed completely negative traits such as persistent stubbornness and a determined refusal to listen to others.'

In response to the vile comments made, Tory MP Conor Burns, a friend of the former prime minister, said he was 'delighted' that her opponents still felt so strongly.

'The hatred that burns in their hearts against Margaret Thatcher is actually an enormous tribute to Margaret Thatcher, because she won,' he explained.
