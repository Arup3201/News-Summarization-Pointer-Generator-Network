William Petit and his wife Christine today released a picture of their adorable baby boy William, whose birth heralds a new chapter of happiness for the couple six years after Dr Petit's first wife and daughters were killed in a horrifying home invasion.

Christine gave birth to the boy on November 23 at 6.24am - one week earlier than her due date of December 3.

The boy was named William Petit III after his father and grandfather. The photo of the adorable, dark-haired boy wearing a blue baby-gro and lying on a blanket, was proudly posted to the Facebook page of Mrs Petit's photography business on Wednesday.

It was posted with the message: 'Happiest and sweetest time ever...our new little son, William. So in love!'

Bundle of joy: William Arthur Petit III was born on November 23 to Christine Petit and her husband Dr William Petit

Hundreds of well-wishers posted comments and shared the photo, to which Mrs Petit responded: 'Thank you! Over the moon, he's so chill too. Eats like a champ.'

Baby William brings happy news for Dr Petit whose first wife Jennifer and two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, were raped and murdered in a horrific attack at the family's Connecticut home in 2007. 

The family was held hostage for hours
 at their Cheshire home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit 
was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape.

Dr Petit and Christine Paluf met at the doctor's local country club, when the professional photographer offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his late wife and daughters.

The doctor and Christine announced shortly before their first wedding anniversary 
on August 5 that they were expecting a child.

When
 local news station WFSB interviewed the couple before the birth, Petit 
said he was very excited about the prospect of a new baby and ready to 
start changing diapers again.

Responding to the reporter's question 
about starting a family again, Dr Petit turned somber, saying ‘children 
are always your jewels'.

‘Children
 are the hope for the future,’ he said with a catch in his throat, 
adding that most parents aim to teach children how to be good people and
 help others.

Good news: The couple met while Christine was volunteering for the Petit Family Foundation, created in the memory of William's wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11

Joy: Christine Petit (second left) and her husband, Dr William Petit, announced in August they are expecting their first child together as they looked after William's niece

First picture: Christine said back in August that her husband insisted that the baby's foot seen in ultrasound images looks like a 'boy foot'

After
 the years of darkness that William Petit lived through in the aftermath
 of his family's massacre, the bereaved husband and father was craving 
light - his new wife stepped in to brighten his life in every way 
possible.

Petit met Christine at a local 
country club in 2008, where she worked as a marketing director. After 
they got chatting, she offered her professional photography services to 
the foundation.

In 
April, she released pictures of their new home and life together and 
explained how they have found peace in Western Connecticut.

When the killers went on trial in 
2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the 
courthouse along with his relatives and listening to hours of agonizing 
testimony.

Last year they got married and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut.

Dr Petit retired from practicing medicine after the horrific incident and has now dedicated his life to the foundation.

He has been approached about running for Congress and told reporters he was considering it after having talks with Republican Party officials.

He is continually touched by those who have reached out to him and donated their money, time and kindness.

After the home invasion, 25,000 pieces of mail came from all over the world. Some sent money for the foundation, a dollar bill, a $5,000 check, a handwritten note, a card.

They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them.

The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present.

William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence.

The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sac turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there.
