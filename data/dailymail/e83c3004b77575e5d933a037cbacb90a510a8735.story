Four acoustic 'pings' which were at the centre of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 are no longer believed to be from the aircraft's black box, a US Navy official has claimed.

Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet, which disappeared in March, after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600 km off Australia's northwest coast.

But according to Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders.

Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600km off Australia's northwest coast

He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew.

Speaking to CNN, Mr Dean said: ‘Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator.’

He also said that if the pings had come from the plane’s flight recorders then searchers would have found them and confirmed other countries agreed with his theory.

The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough but no further promising signals were heard before the expiry of the batteries on the black box's locator beacons.

A scan of the area around the pings with an unnamed submarine failed to find any sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history.

Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The US Navy official’s claims come just days after underwater scientists said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's announcement that black box pingers had been found was premature and lacked detailed analysis.

The acoustic experts, who wished to remain anonymous, said the four critical signals picked up by the pinger locator were almost definitely not from MH370’s black box and agreed they were likely to be from a different man-made source.

The experts said the signals were detected too far apart to be from the black box and were also the wrong frequency.

'As soon as I saw the frequency and the distance between the pings I knew it couldn’t be the aircraft pinger,' one of the scientists said.

The pings had played a key role in shaping the search for the plane, which vanished on a routine flight as it crossed the South China Sea.

Australian authorities have not yet commented on the most recent claims about the pings.
