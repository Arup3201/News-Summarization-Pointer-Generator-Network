She's famous for her curvy figure and now 
model Kelly Brook has encouraged other women to embrace their curves while launching her new plus-size fashion range.

The 14 designs, created for plus size retailer Simply Be, include figure-flattering dresses and neat tummy-controlling skirts and are available from a smaller size 10 to a plus size range up to 32.

'I really wanted it to reflect some of the latest trends but
 also give women the confidence to embrace and show off their assets,' explained Kelly, who is herself only a size 10.

'I’ve 
always found it difficult to find clothes that fit my body shape, so 
this has been a wonderful opportunity to create a range that is all 
about fitting and accentuating curves.'

Inspiration for the capsule collection came from the 34-year-old's own wardrobe, although Kelly also revealed that the catwalk played a part. 

As a result, there's a hint of her two favourite designers Preen and Prada about the collection, as well as a vintage feel courtesy of her style icons Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Sophia Loren.

Stand-out numbers include a sexy jumpsuit in grey lace with cross-over neckline, a leopard print trim blazer with coordinating pencil skirt and a figure-hugging burgundy dress.

But the piece most likely to fly off shelves is Kelly's favourite; a £60 floral bodycon swirl dress that she wore for the catwlak launch at the Savoy Hotel last week.

Determined to show off how the look should be styled, the model teamed the dress with a pair of patent nude heels and wore her hair in glamorous curls.

Elegant though she looked in it, the star, who is engaged to David McIntosh, said the best thing about the event was seeing her creations come to life, which she described as a 'dream come true'.

'The models today are gorgeous,' she said following the show. 'It's great seeing my designs finally being worn by these women.'

But it's not only her fashion collection
 that's been attracting attention of late. More recently, Kelly caused controversy courtesy of some indiscreet admissions about her past relationships 
in new tell-all autobiography, Close Up.

Kelly was on the wrong end of a Twitter backlash after appearing to laugh while discussing domestic violence on ITV's This Morning, and told of 'punching' two of her famous 
ex-boyfriends in the face.

Viewers were outraged, accusing her of trivialising domestic violence, although Kelly herself was unrepentant; appearing on Radio 1 the following day where she revealed that she refused to send her ex-boyfriends copies of the book ahead of publication for fear of being hit with an injunction..

'Usually they take out injunctions don't
 they, these premiership players,' she said. 'So I thought if I send it to him [Danny Cipriani], he'll
 probably do that.

'So I'd rather be sued than have an injunction. I'd 
rather get my voice out there and then go to jail. I'm in a really happy place and I'm in a happy relationship and I'm working in America.

'It wasn't to put the knife in on anyone. I just wanted to have my say.'
