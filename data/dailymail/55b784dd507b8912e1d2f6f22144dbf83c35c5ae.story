Olatunji Kazeem was employed as a customer service adviser at Slough Borough Council when he embarked on the forgery

A trusted council employee exploited his position of
responsibility to siphon more than £130,000 earmarked for benefits claimants
into false accounts he had set up.

Olatunji Kazeem was employed as a customer service adviser at
Slough Borough Council when he embarked on the forgery.

The 37-year-old Nigerian was bailed when his court case
finished on Monday but is now on the run after failing to return to Reading
Crown Court for sentencing today.

In his absence, Judge Angela Morris handed him a four and a
half year jail term after hearing that he stole benefits and HMRC tax credits in
excess of £130,000.

The court had been told that Kazeem 'harvested' local
residents’ information from the council’s computer systems and then, armed with scores
of personal account numbers, he contacted Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
department to say that individuals had changed their bank details.

Between August 2008 and August 2010, housing benefit and
child tax credit money was redirected into accounts he had set up under a host
of fake names.

He was eventually caught after colleagues became suspicious
about the information he was viewing on his work computer.

Kazeem admitted a total of 37 counts of fraud and Judge
Morris branded his offences a 'cynical manipulation' and a 'gross breach of
trust’.

She added: 'What is so apparent is that those people whom he
targeted were the very people who relied on those benefits to live.

'I am assuming that they were not leading lavish lifestyles
but simply surviving.

'He (Kazeem) took advantage of the system and them for his
own personal gain.

'I am told that in Child Tax Credit alone he took in excess
of £130,000.'

Judge Morris had previously released Kazeem on bail after he
entered guilty pleas at Reading Crown Court on Monday.

He was due to return to the court this morning, but when neither
he, nor his friend who was due to act as a character witness appeared and
neither was contactable on the phone, Judge Morris proceeded to sentence without
him.

David Burgess, defending, said that his client had lived in
this country for over a decade and had married his wife, also a Nigerian woman,
in 2004.

He said: 'The prosecution accepts that there were others
involved. I can only offer that the idea may not have been his own to set this
up.'

He said he did not know why the defendant had not showed up
to be sentenced but simply added that 'courage may have failed him'.

A warrant was issued for the arrest of Kazeem, whose address
was given as Europe Road, London.

Judge Morris sentenced Kazeem to four and a half years in
jail on each count, to be served concurrently.

He was found to have overstayed his visa and the UK Border
Agency can deport him at the end of his sentence.

Judge Morris added: 'I take the view that he has chosen to
absent himself and cynically manipulate this court as well.'
