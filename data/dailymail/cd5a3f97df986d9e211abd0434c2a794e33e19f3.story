Nicolas Anelka was on target for the first time since his 'quenelle' gesture as his new side Mumbai City ran out 1-0 winners in the Indian Super League on Sunday.

The 35-year-old, who made his debut in a 5-1 defeat against Chennaiyin FC on Tuesday, was the difference against Kerala Blasters as his expertly taken free-kick secured all three points for the hosts.

Anelka will be hoping this latest spell will bring about no controversy after his ban for his quenelle celebration while playing for former side West Brom.

The veteran forward was banned for five games by the FA after he performed the anti-semitic gesture having scored for the Baggies against West Ham earlier this year. 

The former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker denied his use of the 'quenelle' gesture was anti-Semitic and that he made the gesture in support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a controversial French comedian.

Before signing for Mumbai City in September, Anelka had been without a club after getting sacked by the Midlands side for gross misconduct in March.

And Anelka endured a frustrating start to life at his new side, as he was forced to watch on from the sidelines after missing the first three games of the season owing to suspension.

But Anelka has wasted little time in making an instant impact on the field since, as his glorious free-kick secured Mumbai's second victory of the season.

The former Arsenal and West Brom forward is one of a host of big-names in the ISL, with the likes of Robert Pires, Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet also plying their trade there.
