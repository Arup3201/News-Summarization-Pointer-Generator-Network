A heroic woman gardener dived into the River Thames to save a drowning labradoodle in a vet's collar which had jumped over the wall of its owner's garden.

Julia Wylie, 36, had been working in the garden of her client's home in Putney, London, when the puppy called Jess jumped over the back wall of the £2million home next to the river.

With no thought for her own life, Ms Wylie instinctively took her shoes off and jumped in after the puppy.

Images show Ms Wylie desperately holding the dog under her arm in 25ft of water on Tuesday.

Hero: Julia Wylie is pulled to safety after jumping into the River Thames to save the life of a drowning puppy

It took 10 minutes before the pair were spotted by a crew member on a passing Thames Clipper river-bus.

The captain steered the boat towards Miss Wylie and the puppy before a second-mate threw a rope into the water.

Miss Wylie, from Brixton, told the Evening Standard: 'I had no hesitation about jumping in. 

'I took off my shoes and jumped down six feet. When I got in I tried to hang onto plants on the side of the wall but the tide was really strong and all the bushes just pulled off when I tried to grab them.'

Miss Wylie soon realised that there was nothing to hold on to and had to tread water while lifting Jess up.

She also feared the current would drag them down river.

Joseph Wiltshire, 22, was on board the river-bus when he threw a rope out to Miss Wylie. 

A Port of London Authority rescue boat was called and managed to pull the pair out of the water in front of a cheering crowd. 

The dog was returned to its owner while Ms Wylie was checked over. She then arrived back at her client's house in her soaked through clothes and barefoot.

The Port of London Authority said the rescue showed great teamwork on the River Thames

Before she left she put chicken wire along the wall to help prevent the Jess from jumping over again.

Martin Garside, from the Port of London Authority, described Mr Wiltshire as a hero.

He said: 'This successful rescue of both the woman and the dog was a great piece of teamwork on the Thames.

'Joe Wiltshire from the Thames Clipper Riverbus showed great skill  and professionalism in getting a rope to them both swiftly.

'He then worked side by side with Jim Denby and Danny Marsh from the Port of London Authority to get Julia and the dog Jess to safety on board our launch ‘Benfleet’.

'All three guys did a grand job and we were pleased to play our part.'
