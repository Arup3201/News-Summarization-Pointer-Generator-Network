Thousands of supporters left farewell messages for Lady Thatcher in condolence books across the world yesterday.

Two were opened in her home town of Grantham, and another in the North London constituency of Finchley which she represented for 33 years.

Books were also placed in British embassies and high commissions from Budapest to Quito, Cape Town to Singapore and Washington DC.

More than a thousand people had last night signed an online condolence book on the Downing Street website and many left flowers outside her home

There was even a chance to pay tribute in Brussels, scene of some of her fiercest political clashes.

MEP Daniel Hannan said the condolence book, signed by a few well-wishers at the European Parliament, would have ‘tickled’ Lady Thatcher.

More than a thousand people had last night signed an online condolence book on the Downing Street website, and a selection of comments will be passed on to her family.

All British missions abroad will have a book unless they are prevented for safety reasons, the Cabinet Office said, and one will be open to the public and politicians in central London, at a location to be announced today.

In Grantham yesterday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, a former Conservative, was among those who gave his sympathies.

He took a detour from campaigning in nearby Boston, Lincolnshire, ahead of county council elections, to write: ‘A very patriotic and fine lady.’

Afterwards he said her deregulation of the City had a huge impact on his life.

He added: ‘I was planning to go into the Army after university but when she got rid of foreign exchange controls the City suddenly became an attractive proposition. I ended up going straight into a City dealing room at 18.

‘Whether you liked her or didn’t like her she was an incredibly patriotic, brave lady and everything she did she genuinely believed was in the best interests of this country and the people of this country.’

Dozens of supporters went to Lady Thatcher’s home in Chester Square, Belgravia, some leaving bouquets.

One message read: ‘Thank you for inspiring generations and helping us to make Great our Britain.’

Another said: ‘The Winston Churchill of our times.’

A removal man who helped Margaret Thatcher leave Downing Street was among those paying their respects at her Belgravia home.

Irishman Patrick Delaney, 68, said the Baroness never forgot his name and asked to be addressed as Margaret rather than Mrs Thatcher.

Outside the Chester Square townhouse, Mr Delaney said: ‘I was very privileged to have known her.

‘I got to talk to her in the short time that I was with her in her houses and to me she was a very ordinary woman, she would have time to have a conversation with people, certainly me, I’m just an ordinary mover and she was very friendly with me.

‘She was friendly with all the workers, she always have tea, biscuits and coffee and after the first time I met her she never forgot my name, and I found that quite amazing.

‘She had a great memory for names. She’d say: “Don’t call me Mrs Thatcher, call me Margaret”.’
