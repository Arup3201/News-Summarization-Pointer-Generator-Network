Williams driver Valtteri Bottas insists he'll be 100 per cent ready to race at this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, after a back injury forced him to miss the start of the season.

The Finn sat out the Formula One curtain-raiser at Melbourne's Albert Park in Australia on March 15 after tearing an annular disc in his lower back during qualifying. 

'After such a frustrating Sunday in Australia, I have taken the necessary measures to make sure I arrive in Malaysia fit to race and ready to bring the results home,' Bottas said in a statement on Thursday.

In order to race at Kuala Lumpur, the 25-year-old will have to pass FIA medical tests at the track on Thursday - something his manager Didier Coton believes will be no problem.

'Valtteri is in very good shape,' Coton told BBC Sport. 'He is working very hard.

'I spoke with him today [Monday] and he is in top shape. He will have to take the FIA medical, which I expect him to pass.

'I don't see any reason why he wouldn't pass it - he tells me he is back to normal. I'm very confident about it, but of course I am not a doctor.'

Williams currently lie fourth in the constructors' championship after Bottas' team-mate Felipe Massa secured 12 points with a fourth place finish in Melbourne.
