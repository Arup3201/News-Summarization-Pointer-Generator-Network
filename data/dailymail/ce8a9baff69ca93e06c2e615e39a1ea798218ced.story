A Mormon doctor accused of murdering his wife with a cocktail of prescription drugs so he could continue an affair with the nanny allegedly boasted to inmates that no one could prove he killed her.

As Martin MacNeill's murder trial began on Thursday, prosecutors painted him as a liar and a cheat who was determined to make his wife have a facelift so that he could poison her during her recovery.

Michele MacNeill, 50, was found slumped in her bathtub in Pleasant Grove, Utah in April 2007 by her six-year-old daughter. Hours later, the mother-of-eight was pronounced dead.

On Thursday, prosecutor Sam Pead said that MacNeill, a one-time doctor who also taught Sunday school at his local Mormon church, told inmates after his arrest that his wife was a 'b****'.

On trial: Martin MacNeill appears in court in Provo, Utah on Thursday as opening statements in his murder trial begin. He is accused of forcing his wife to have a face-lift so he could kill her with a cocktail of drugs

Together: His wife Michele, a former beauty queen, was found dead at their home in April 2007

He told them that he was glad that she had died and that authorities would never be able to prove that he had killed her, Pead said.

Prosecutors said the killing was 
the climax of a twisted plot by MacNeill to continue an affair with his 
children's nanny, Gypsy Willis, whom he invited to his wife's funeral 
and soon 
asked to marry him.

They said he acted erratically the day Michele died, yelled that she had wanted the surgery and later said he was glad his wife was dead, Pead told jurors.

Even his own lawyers did not paint him in a flattering light on Thursday.

'Martin
 has made poor choices in his life. He had affairs during his marriage,' Susanne Gustin said.

'Shortly
 after his wife passed away, he brought [his mistress] into his home. We may think he's a total jerk and disgusting. And that's 
natural. But decide this case on the facts rather than the emotion.'

Opening statements: Defense lawyer Suzanne Gustin, pictured, said the jury may believe her client is a 'total jerk' for cheating on his wife and inviting his mistress to her funeral, but that it does not mean he's a killer

Testimony: Dr. Scott Thompson, who performed Michele's facelift, said he gave her a different selection of drugs to what he usually gave patients because her husband was a doctor whom he trusted

Tense: MacNeill, a former Sunday school teacher, listens to witness testimony on the first day of his trial

Prosecutors
 said they would try to prove that MacNeill made a plastic surgeon to 
prescribe a powerful set of neurological drugs for her recovery that 
left her comatose in the bathtub.

MacNeill, 57, was charged in August 2012, nearly five years after his wife was found in the couple's Pleasant Grove home.

Medical examiners couldn't determine how 50-year-old Michele MacNeill died. They initially ruled she died of natural causes, possibly from a heart disorder, then changed the finding to undetermined.

The uncertainty was one reason it took so long to prosecute Martin MacNeill on the murder charge.

Von Welch, a doctor who examined Michele before cosmetic surgery, said her husband was eager to 'get things going' and was surprised the couple rejected his advice to put it off until she got her high blood pressure under control.

Dr. Scott Thompson, who performed Michele's 
facelift, also testified on Thursday and recalled how MacNeill joined his wife at her 
consultations and on the day of the procedure.

Emotion: Michele's relatives listen to testimony as MacNeill's trial begins; it is expected to last six weeks

Sadness: Rachel MacNeill, pictured outside the courtroom ahead of the trial, has long been vocal about her belief that her father killed her mother. The couple had eight children together

He
 told the court that MacNeill requested extra medications for his wife 
outside what is usually prescribed as he was concerned whether she 
could handle the pain.

He 
went on to prescribe seven medications to Michele, including two pain 
medications, a sleeping pill, anti-nausea medication, valium, a steroid 
for swelling and an antibiotic.

Dr 
Thompson added that he usually did not prescribe the combination of 
medications that he gave her - but that he did so because he know 
MacNeill was a doctor, and he trusted him.

In

 his opening statements, Pead added that MacNeill told his daughter he 
'probably over medicated' Michele the day after she had a facelift and 
that he disposed of the pills Michele had been taking within a few hours
 of the death.

The 
MacNeills had eight children, and their oldest daughters have been 
outspoken in their belief that their father killed their mother.

Family: MacNeill had worked as a Mormon bishop and had eight children, pictured, with his wife

Rachel
 MacNeill and Alexis Somers, who are both expected to take the stand, 
have gone on national TV with their claims and sat in his court hearings
 holding up photographs of their mother.

The
 trial before 4th District Court Judge Derek Pullan is expected to last 
six weeks and MacNeill's mistress, Gypsy Willis, is also expected to 
testify.

The
 doctor later went to prison on fraud charges, and it wasn't until his 
release that prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction
 of justice.

Willis also 
served prison time for fraud. The allegations included forging a 
document that said they were married on April 14, 2007 - the day of 
Michele MacNeill's funeral.
