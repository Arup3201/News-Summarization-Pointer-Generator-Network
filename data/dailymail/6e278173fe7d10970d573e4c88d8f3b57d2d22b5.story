Manchester United could struggle to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive season, according to former defender Phil Neville.

After crashing out of the FA Cup following a 2-1 defeat by Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday evening, Louis van Gaal's uninspired side only have a top four finish to focus on for the remainder of this season.

United are currently in fourth place, a point behind Arsenal - although, with Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham also in the chase, a swift return to Europe's elite competition is far from guaranteed.

Speaking to BBC 5 Live, Neville admitted his former club face a fight to finish fourth or higher, especially with fixtures against Liverpool, Tottenham and the derby with Manchester City in their next four games.

'Momentum works both ways and for United now, they can't win silverware and all they've got left to concentrate on for the rest of the season is a top four finish,' he said.

'There's tricky period for them when they still have to play the likes of Chelsea, Man City, as well as Everton.

'It's a massive. massive last two months of the season for them. The results have been OK, but the performances have got to improve.'
