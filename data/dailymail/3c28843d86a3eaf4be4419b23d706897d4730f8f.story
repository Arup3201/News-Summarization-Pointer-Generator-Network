A new Christmas survey has shown that New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia are forecast to spend the most per person on Christmas gifts, while cheap jewellery or something from a service station may be the ideal gift if you come from Victoria.

According to the Commonwealth Bank’s survey of 1,000 Australians, the bludgeoning economy of NSW with their strong population growth, and Western Australia, whose economy is thriving because of the mining industry, means that people from here will be forking out the most cash over Christmas.

However, their survey also showed that Victoria was the ‘Mr Scrooge’ state as the statistics proved that it is the most frugal state over Christmas. With this in mind, Victoria shoppers should check out the results from another recent survey. Canstar asked 3,000 adults questions like if they feel obliged to spend lots of money, and how much they spend on their loved ones.

The Chodzinski family and friends sit down for Christmas dinner last year. Matriarch, Dorothy Chodzinksi, from Newcastle was one of those surveyed by CommBank about spending over the festive season

Their research discovered that the worst gift people received at Christmas was cheap jewellery on 28 per cent; followed by toiletries (such as deodorant, body spray, perfume) at 25 per cent, and socks or underwear at 20 per cent.

Canstar also found that 57 per cent of people feel obliged to spend a certain amount on gifts; 48 per cent tended to leave buying gifts until the last minute; while 12 per cent have bought a last-minute gift from a service station.

Cheap jewellery was rated by Canstar's survey as the worst Christmas present to get

Tacky underwear might appeal to some, but 20 per cent of people told Canstar's survey that they hated receiving them as a Christmas present

On a more serious note, Commbank's survey uncovered that while many consumers expected to have the bulk of their festive shopping done by today, the average Aussie is forecast to spend an additional $1,079 over the coming weeks.

Nationwide, CommBank forecasted that festive spending would peak at $17.8 billion in the five weeks between December 1, 2014, and January 6, 2015.

Dorothy Chodzinksi from Newcastle was one of those surveyed by CommBank. This Christmas she said she’d spend $600 in total on her two daughters, while on her three nieces and three nephews she’d spend a total of $500-$600.

‘In my extended family we don’t buy gifts for our siblings, but instead concentrate on each other’s children. Christmas is all about them after all,” she said.

She also couldn’t agree more with some of the results that Canstar’s research threw up.

‘Cheap jewellery is a pretty ordinary present, I have to say. Something that doesn’t reflect the person’s personality and lifestyle I’d class as a bad present. You have to show that you’ve made an effort,’ she said.

20 per cent of the 3,000 people surveyed by Canstar hated to get socks as Christmas presents

In a sign of the changing times, CommBank stated that online retailers can expect a busy start to December, with the research revealing six million Aussies plan to do their online gift shopping on December 1, 2014.

However, the vast majority (72 per cent) of shoppers will purchase gifts at bricks and mortar stores, with festive spending expected to peak at shopping malls on Saturday, December 13, when 3.2 million consumers are forecast to hit the shops.

‘While consumers have been sending mixed signals on their spending intent in recent weeks, our research shows consumers are planning to open their wallets and spend big in the lead up to, and directly after, Christmas Day,’ Diana Mousina, Economist, Commonwealth Bank, said.

In other areas Aussies are expected to spend a large portion of their festive budget in the Boxing Day sales ($2.6 billion) and entertaining friends and family ($1.7 billion).

Underwear, cheap jewellery, toiletries and socks ranked as the worst Christmas presents going

‘Interestingly, while consumers expected to have completed the bulk of their Christmas shopping by today, our research shows they are still planning to spend an additional $1,000 and the bulk of that will go on gifts,’ Mousina said.

‘Other areas we’re expecting consumers to spend include entertaining friends and family, and eating and drinking in and out of the home.'
