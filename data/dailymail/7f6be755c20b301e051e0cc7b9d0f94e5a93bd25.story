Forget the fuss over Falcao, the impending Old Trafford debut of British transfer record signing Angel Di Maria is what should be getting Manchester United fans excited right now.

For £60million, you’d expect a player who can run, dribble, cross, pass and score goals for fun.

Thankfully for Louis van Gaal, that’s just what Di Maria did for Argentina against Germany on Wednesday night, having a hand in every goal in a 4-2 win.

Running riot: Angel di Maria shone for Argentina in their 4-2 win against Germany on Wednesday

Di Maria, 26, excelled in a free role by Argentina boss Gerardo Martino due to Lionel Messi missing out through injury. If he can repeat the performance against QPR on Sunday September 14, United’s early-season woe will be quickly forgotten.

The heat map showed the versatility United’s biggest signing has in his locker.

He hugged both left and right touchlines at times, drifted inside to make an impact on other occasions, and had the energy to get into the penalty area with some great runs.

From an inside-right position, he produced a fantastic pass with the outside of his left boot for Sergio Aguero to score the opening goal.

He crossed for Tottenham’s Erik Lamela from the right-hand byline and set up Federico Fernandez with a set-piece.

He then scored the fourth himself with a delightful dink over advancing goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, timing his run into the area to perfection to receive and dispatch Javier Mascherano’s pass.

It must have given food for thought for van Gaal as he works out how to assemble his expensive chess pieces in the right formation.

He was the outstanding individual from a clash between the two best teams in the world, and it wasn’t surprising Martino described him afterwards as ‘one of the best five players in the world’.

It’s clear he could play wide, in the middle or as an orthodox No10 for United. Or a combination of all three. Just set him free and let him get on the ball!

Di Maria was injured when Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final in July – and showed in Dusseldorf how badly the South Americans missed him.

Now it’ll soon be time to turn his attention back to United, where former Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, one of Di Maria’s predecessors to wear United’s famous No7 shirt, has already given his blessing. ‘Di Maria is going to be good. I told him being No7 is a big responsibility but he will be able to live up to it’.

The hype that was attached to United’s dramatic deadline day capture of Falcao on loan somewhat overshadowed the fact that their most important piece of business was signing Di Maria from Real Madrid.

Van Gaal won’t be able to squeeze in all his big names and Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao and particularly Juan Mata will be sweating, not to mention Adnan Januzaj, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia lower down the pecking order.

Yet Di Maria won’t have to worry. He will be in any strongest United XI. The only question is where?

Van Gaal primarily sees him as a winger, complaining that the wide players already at the club weren’t world-class.

But Di Maria showed, especially with the opening assist for Aguero, that if he does drift inside, he has the vision to create chances from virtually nothing. 

Food for thought: Di Maria's ability means United boss Louis van Gaal could use him in several formations

If van Gaal chooses a 4-3-1-2, Di Maria is capable of playing at No10, supplying the ammunition for two out of Rooney, van Persie and Falcao. That would guarantee he sees as much of the ball as possible.

Or he could be part of a midfield three with Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick or Daley Blind, though that would take away some of his attacking dimension.

In a 3-5-2, he could bomb on from midfield, and van Gaal might even think he’s got the work-rate to be one of the wing-backs.

Supreme talent: Di Maria could be utilised as a wing-back, winger or central midfielder by van Gaal

In a 4-3-3, he could play either right or left to feed Falcao or van Persie.

Van Gaal’s philosophy is all about footballing intelligence and the ability to change positions, not only between matches but during matches too.

In that respect, Di Maria is his identikit signing. If he can prove it against world champions Germany, imagine how he might tear up the Premier League.
