Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes last night while two drivers saw their cars swept away as parts of Britain saw almost a month and a half's worth of rain fall in just 24 hours.

In Redcar, Cleveland, up to 60 people had to be evacuated while in nearby Saltburn part of a bridge was washed away with some areas seeing up to three inches of rain fall.  

And on the other side of the country a freak hail storm covered parts of Devon and Cornwall in a blanket of white creating a winter wonderland, at the beginning of September.

In some areas of North Yorkshire as much as 75mm of rain fall over a 24 hour period, almost one and a half times the average September monthly rainfall. Durham was Britain's wettest city with over 58mm of rain.

Crews from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in Redcar were scrambled following fears that the cars carried by flood water had their occupants inside.

TOMORROW:  Some heavy showers across western parts of the country, while brighter towards the east. A chance of fog in the morning before the showers move east. Maximum temperatures of 19C in the south falling to 3C at night in some parts of the north.

MONDAY: Light and scattered showers across northern and eastern parts elsewhere it will be largely dry with clear bright spells. A little warmer with maximum temperatures of 19C in the south while falling at night to 4C in the north

Dave Cocks, deputy launching authority 
at RNLI Redcar, said: 'There's an area at Saltburn very close to the sea
where two streams converge and then flow out to the sea.

'They were both extremely swollen with flood water, and coincidentally there was quite a high tide.'The
initial report was that a bridge had collapsed and two cars swept into 
flood water, and two occupants had been carried out to sea.

'We
were preparing to launch when we got a call saying the police 
helicopter and fire services were on the scene and were able to confirm 
that everyone had been accounted for.'

Mr
Cocks said the rain started mid-morning and 'increased in ferocity' 
throughout the afternoon. Flooding in Redcar began about 3pm, and badly 
hit areas such as Loftus and Skinningrove, peaking about 7pm.

Mr Cocks said weather systems recorded 8mm of rainfall per hour.

'It was very intense in a very short time,' he added.

Cleveland
fire fighters were joined by crews from North Yorkshire and Durham and 
Darlington as they carried out rescues at more than 10 different 
locations.

The hail storm left cars sliding on roads occurred at about 17:00 BST after a Met Office warning of heavy rain in the South West overnight
