It may be a superstitious decision, but following David Moyes' disastrous season in charge of Manchester United, it has been confirmed that the next manager, Louis van Gaal, will not be afforded a banner at Old Trafford's Stretford End.

United legend Sir Alex Ferguson was originally honoured with a 72-metre banner proclaiming 'The Impossible Dream Made Possible' to celebrate 25 years at the club, which included wining 37 trophies.

Stretford End Flags followed this with a 'Chosen One' banner for Moyes after the Scot arrived at the behest of his predecessor - butÂ  Van Gaal will not see his name in the stands, according to the Manchester Evening News.

United's form suffered so miserably under Moyes, especially at Old Trafford, that the a contingent of supporters staged a fly-over protest with a plane trailing a banner that read: 'Wrong One - Moyes Out'.

Moyes banner was taken down when the manager was sacked, and the group responsible have now announced that its replacement will not be about the next manager.

They wrote
 on Twitter: 'The Moyes banner was made to show support for the new 
manager, as was the call by Fergie. The next manager will not have a 
banner made.

'All
 design ideas considered. Mock ups ideally needed showing 
fonts/images/colours. Max height is 1.2 metres. Designs will go up for a
 vote.

'The
 length of any new banner will be determined by the fonts used & the
 design. Longest banner length considered would fill a quadrant area.'

club's first foreign boss - will begin his new role after this summer's 
World Cup in Brazil.

Van Gaal 
was delighted, saying: 'It was always a wish for me to work in the 
Premier League. To work as a manager for Manchester United, the biggest 
club in the world, makes me very proud.

'I
 have managed in games at Old Trafford before and know what an 
incredible arena Old Trafford is and how passionate and knowledgeable 
the fans are. This club has big ambitions; I too have big ambitions. 
Together I'm sure we will make history.'
