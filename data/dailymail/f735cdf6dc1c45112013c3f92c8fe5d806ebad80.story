A Utah driver should been as honest with himself as he was with the officer who pulled him over last year.

According to police, Jason Barlow blurted out 'I am way too intoxicated to drive now' when he was pulled over by an officer on November 24.

Barlow, 45, was allegedly caught driving at 100mph in a 65mph zone and had a blood-alcohol content of .185, which is more than two times the legal limit in Utah.

Even before his frank admission, Barlow told the officer, 'I am in big trouble' when he was first appraoched in his car.

Asked why he was worried by the officer, Barlow replied, 'Because I was just arrested for DUI a month ago and I am way too intoxicated to drive now,' according to court paprts.

Barlow, appeared in court on Monday charged with DUI and speeding.

The same court records show Barlow has been in and out of trouble with the police for DUI's since 1991.
