Former X Factor judge Tulisa appeared in court today for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal.

The former N-Dubz star, 25, is said to have been caught referring to cocaine as 'white sweets' during a newspaper sting.

However causing as much of a stir as her ongoing legal woes was concern over the singer's face which appeared noticeably puffy and swollen as she walked into court.

Tulisa arrived a Southwark Crown Court this morning for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal

The difference between Tulisa's face between 2009 (left) and 2014 (right) is striking

Though she has previously denied having had a nose job and lip fillers, Tulisa's face is markedly different to the fresh-faced girl who burst onto the pop music scene in 2007. 

In addition to a change in shape of her nose and fuller lips, Tulisa's face appeared slightly 'pulled back' and swollen

The singer was keen to hide her plumped-up pout as she left a beauty salon in Central London in October last year.

In August last year, she also put her slimmer looking nose down to the fact she had lost weight.

She told the Mirror at the time: 'It's not a deliberate thing, and I really don't give a toss about being skinny. That's just not me. But when I lose weight it goes from my face, and everyone says my nose looks thinner.

'I swear on my life I've not had it done. I've literally just lost weight, and it goes from my nose!'

Annemarie Gillett, Non Surgical Director from Transform Cosmetic Surgery commented: ‘Looking at the photos provided, Tulisa definitely looks like she has had some kind of temporary dermal filler to her lips and is a very popular treatment with women of Tulisa’s age. Tulisa’s lips looked thinner in earlier pictures.

'The elongated and shiny forehead is a classic tell-tale sign of having injectable wrinkle treatment.

'Her cheeks also look fuller than in earlier photographs.

'Her skin looks quite taut and shiny which would suggest Tulisa has had regular facial peels/skin rejuvenation treatments.

'It appears Tulisa has indulged in non-surgical treatments of late. However Tulisa is very young and less is more and I would encourage using less product and leaving more time in between treatments.'

Cosmetic and plastic surgeon, Paul Banwell FRCS (Plast) from the Banwell Clinic says: 'I think Tulisa looks great but I can see the tell-tale signs of Botox, fillers in her lips and possibly in her cheeks too.

'She looks like she’s lost a bit of weight in her face as well which has made her lips look more sensuous and striking.'

The former X Factor judge is accused of arranging a transaction between Sun on Sunday's undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood and her friend, Mike GLC, real name  Michael Coombs, 35.

The alleged deal is said to have been arranged at London's Dorchester Hotel on May 10 last year.

The singer arrived at Southwark Crown Court with her legs on display, wearing a smart navy dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and white cuffs on three-quarter length sleeves that bared her tattoo which reads "The Female Boss" tattoo.

She had her straight dark hair pulled back into half pony-tail and teamed the outfit with nude patent heels.

The outfit was reminiscent of the dress worn by Rebakah Brooks on June 18 to her own court case at the Old Bailey, where she was ultimately found not guilty.

Tulisa's navy shift dress with white collar was similar to the out fir worn by Rebekah Brooks (pictured right with husband Charlie) last week

Tulisa, real name Tula Contostavlos, sat in the back row of the barristers' seats, listening intently to arguments her counsel advanced.

Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, North London, was allegedly snared by an investigation which saw the tabloid report that half an ounce of cocaine changed hands as a result of the deal with Mr Mahmood, sometimes known as the 'fake sheikh'.

She denies one count of helping an undercover reporter obtain 0.5oz (13.9g) of cocaine for £860, while Coombs of Enfield, North London, denies one count of supplying a Class A drug.

A provisional trial date has been set for July 14.

At an appearance at court in January this year Tulisa's lips looked noticeably fuller

In March there were yet further differences to the singer's face, though she has always denied having surgery
