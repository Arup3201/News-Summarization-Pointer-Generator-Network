John Edwards is battling a life-threatening heart condition that will require surgery next month and delay his criminal trial again, a court heard today.

The 58-year-old former Democratic presidential candidate is facing trial in North Carolina for allegedly abusing $1million of campaign finances.

But Judge Catherine Eagles delayed the trial until at least March 26 and said he should avoid driving and travel - including to court proceedings.

Edwards walked into the courtroom in 
Greensboro without assistance and appeared healthy. Judge Eagles had 
requested that he be there.

His cardiologist wrote two letters to 
Judge Eagles but no details were revealed about what sort of surgery or 
what illness Edwards may have.

‘The public has an interest in a speedy trial, and this case has already been continued twice,’ Judge Eagles said on Friday.

‘Ordinarily, I would try to manage 
something like this. But clearly there are some limitations on Mr 
Edwards due to real and serious health issues.’

The National Enquirer claimed last 
month he thought he was dying after a jog when his heart began pounding 
and he struggled to breathe.

‘John fell apart in front of a pal 
after returning from a jog and was afraid he’d die,’ a source close to 
him told the National Enquirer.

‘His heart began pounding and he was 
having laboured breathing,’ the source added. ‘He had many symptoms of a
major heart attack.’

Mr Edwards was suffering from sleep 
problems and migraines - and he has a family history of heart problems, 
reported the National Enquirer.

He was reportedly also suffering from 
stress following the first anniversary of the death of his wife 
Elizabeth earlier this month.

'Although John was told it was just a 
panic attack and not heart-related, the incident shook him,' the source 
told the National Enquirer.

A court motion last month said: 'The 
defendant has a medical issue (that) will prevent a trial of this matter
during the January 2012 criminal term.'

'The failure to grant a continuance would be likely to result in a miscarriage of justice.’

Federal prosecutors filed a separate 
motion opposing the delay, saying they were ready to try him on 
six felony and misdemeanour counts.

These relate to nearly $1million from 
wealthy donors allegedly used to help hide his pregnant mistress Rielle 
Hunter during his 2008 run for the White House.

Mr Edwards denies knowingly violating the law and has pleaded not guilty. He appeared healthy last month at a pre-trial hearing.

The trial start has already been put 
back once after he said he needed more time to prepare his defence and 
attend his daughter's wedding.

He admitted he used the money to cover up the affair - but claims two wealthy donors gave him the cash so he could hide the affair from his wife.

But prosecutors claim the huge donation was a campaign contribution and should therefore be considered under campaign finance rules and limits.

At the time individuals were allowed to contribute only $2,300 to a candidate - and Edwards did not disclose he had received the money.
