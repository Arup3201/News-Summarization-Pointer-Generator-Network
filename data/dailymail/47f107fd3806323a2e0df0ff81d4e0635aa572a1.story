Lakeside meth lab: Madhu Dutta is accused of attempting to set up a meth lab in his million-dollar home

Ohio police have arrested the owner of a luxurious lakeside home in which the makings of a sophisticatedÂ  methamphetamine lab were discovered Wednesday night.

Inside the home, police found equipment and chemicals for a 'thionyl/chloride method' lab, the first of its kind to be found in Ohio.

Madhu Dutta, 51, was arrested Thursday at 3675 East Lake Road in Sheffield Lake for possessing the chemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine.

Officers had been investigating 
suspicious activity at the house since August 2013, but new information 
prompted them to obtain a warrant to search the home.

Also discovered on the property were three handguns, 11 shotguns and a large quantity of ammunition, reports Fox 8.

Chief
 Deputy Dennis Cavanaugh said that while the lab wasn't fully 
functioning, Dutta was in possession of enough chemicals and equipment 
to warrant the charges, reports WKYC.

The
 thionyl method is unique, Cavanaugh said, because of 'the type of 
system, the chemicals being used, the specific type of equipment, and 
you have to have some knowledge or ability to be able to do this.'

Affluent area: The million-dollar home owned by Madhu Dutta

Lake views: The tasteful mansion is home to Madhu Dutta, who lives there alone

There goes the neighborhood: Neighbors in the affluent area were shocked that such a grand home could be the site of a methamphetamine lab

Commercial grade: The chemicals stockpiled by Dutta were for use in a sophisticated meth lab, say police

He added that thionyl/chloride method labs are 'extremely toxic'.

The
 more common method for cooking the drug is known as the one-pot method,
 or 'shake and bake,' which uses household chemicals, unlike the 
commercial grade chemicals found in Dutta's home.

According to ABC News, Dutta's property in the affluent lakeside area was purchased for $1,125,000 last year.

Neighbors were shocked by the arrest of their neighbor.

Weapons: Police found three handguns and 11 shotguns in the home, as well as ammunition

Evidence: A hydrogen tank and generator were discovered, in addition to bottles of chloroform and other chemicals related to the thionyl/chloride method of manufacturing meth

'Around the lake the properties are expensive,' Cavanaugh told ABC News. 'I don't care where you are in this county or the state, you never know when anything like this is going to happen.'

Dutta was charged with two counts of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs and one count of permitting drug abuse.

Dutta pleaded not guilty on April 17 and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on April 24.
