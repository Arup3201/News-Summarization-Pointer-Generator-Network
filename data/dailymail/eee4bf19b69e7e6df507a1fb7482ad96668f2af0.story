A young father who strangled his two sons and then sent a picture of a dead body to their mother will not face execution.

Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced  to life in prison without parole on Thursday at Young County Court.

Armandariz killed his two sons, Gatlin, two, and Luke, who was just eight-months-old in April 2011 before sending  a string of chilling text messages to their mother, Lauren Smith.

One of the messages included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck.

While he will not be put to death, defense attorneys insist he will have a miserable life in prison.

Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison without parole in the capital murder case (above Armandariz pictured in court on March 12 during his sentencing at the Young County Courthouse in Graham, Texas)

Prosecutor Lisa Tanners said the state had to allow the citizens to decide if Armandariz should pay with his life or not (above Armandariz as Young County Judge Stephen Bristow read the jury's decision)

He was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate. However, the jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him

Armandariz was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate, according to the Graham Leader. 

The jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him.

The father was deemed too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the attorney general's office, according to the Star-Telegram.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutor Tom Cloudt said: 'Gabriel is a lying, manipulating baby killer, and the evidence has shown this. 

'Luke is dead, and Gabriel is trying to get a beer. Gabriel is not concerned.'

Armandariz was cited as too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the Texas attorney general's office including, Tom Cloudt, who said the father is not phased by the killings

The father sent a string of chilling text messages to the children's mother, Lauren Smith, which included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck (above Armandariz, left, pictured with Smith, right and their two sons)

Armandariz called police after killing the boys telling them he had done it because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call (above Armandariz pictured with his sons)

Last month, the text messages Armandariz sent to Smith where he said he was planning to kill the boys were revealed in court.

Armandariz said he was doing it because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend. 

In one of the messages Armandariz sent to his ex, just hours before the boys are believe to have died, he wrote: 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends.'

This was quickly followed by another in which he wrote: 'Look, I’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children. But as usual you would much rather be with your friends.'

According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, prosecutors in the case argued that Smith was not even aware the texts were coming from Armandariz, and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time.

This seems to be backed up by the her responses to these texts, as she wrote in one: 'If I were you I’d get the hell away from him. Looks can be deceiving.'

On the day the boys died, Armandariz sent a photo to Smith that appeared to show Luke dead.

This was followed by the final text, which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him, and read: 'We love u, goodbye.' 

The final message Armandariz sent Smith, which included an image of both boys alive and lying next to him, read: 'We love u, goodbye'

In February, Lt. James Reeves (above) revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody'

Once she received the graphic image of her dead son, she called authorities, according to Everything Lubbock.

However, Armandariz had already called police telling them he had killed the boys because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call.

In the bizarre 911 call he told the operator; 'My girlfriend asked me to kill my babies. What was I supposed to do? My girlfriend told me to kill both of them. What was I supposed to do? I hate her, I hate her, I hate her so much. I’m so scared now.'

In February, Lt. James Reeves revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin.

'We were operating on the belief that Luke was dead,' said Lt. Reeves. 'We didn’t know about the older son.'

However, when officers arrived, they found he bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham.

Officers went to Armandriz's home after being alerted about the graphic message sent with image of Luke's dead body. When they arrived, they found both bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham

'We saw four little feet inside the tarp,' said Lt. Reeves.

'One of the feet had a shoe on it. It was a little camel tennis shoe and that’s how we knew. We never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet.'

Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody', according to Texomas Homepage.

While defense lawyers are happy that Armandariz was allowed to live, he will have a 'very miserable life' in prison, said  attorney Terri Moore.

'We have never tried to excuse what Gabriel did,' said Moore. 'What he did was completely wrong and was a criminal act but he’s got life without any possibility of parole and that is a severe punishment. 

'It is a harsh punishment. He will have a very miserable life.'

Moore added that capital punishment is for the 'worst of the worst human being' and the crime Gabriel committed was horrible, but that he is 'not the worst of the worst human being'. 

Armandariz will be transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections to serve his sentence.
