The number of patients in England carrying antibiotic-resistant bacteria has soared

Soaring numbers of patients in England are carrying bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics, hospitals are reporting.

The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of a strain of gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has risen from just five in 2006, to more than 600 in 2013.

Health officials have said that the increase in cases has shown the ‘urgent need’ for hospitals to implement plans and procedures to stem the spread of antibiotic resistance.

Public Health England (PHE) has launched a new toolkit for hospitals to help them control antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).

This is the name given to some strains of gut bacteria that can be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics.

Carbapenems are considered to be ‘last resort’ antibiotics which medics use to treat difficult infections when other antibiotics would or have failed, PHE said.

While infections caused by CPE can still be treated with other antibiotics, treatment may be more difficult, a spokesman said.

He added that in the last decade there has been a ‘sustained’ increase in the number of CPE cases.

About two thirds of trusts in England have had between one and 20 patients identified with CPE carriage or infection over the past five years.

This includes two trusts in Manchester that have had more than 100 patients identified with CPE.

PHE’s medical director Dr Paul Cosford said: ‘In order to minimise the wide spread of these multi-drug resistant infections across England it is essential that all trusts are aware of this toolkit.

'They must also develop plans for detecting and managing patients with infections caused by CPE and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

‘These infections are already causing national concern due to the observed increasing trends in the number of infections, outbreaks and clusters across England.

‘We now have a window of opportunity, if we act quickly and decisively, to address this very real public health threat and prevent widespread problems by minimising the negative impact of these organisms.’

In England in 2006 there were five cases of a gut bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. Last year there were more than 600 cases of the same bacterial infection

England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘Antibiotic resistance poses a real threat to our ability to treat diseases.

‘Although there has been an increase in this strain of bacteria, the new toolkit will ensure that hospitals are well placed to detect, manage and control any cases. Systems of monitoring for resistant bacteria are essential in safeguarding the effect of our antibiotics.’

Health experts have previously warned of the ‘catastrophic threat’ of people becoming resistant to antibiotics, saying that in just 20 years’ time routine operations could become deadly if we lose the ability to fight infection.

Last year, Dame Sally said that resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health.

She said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - helping to create resistance.
