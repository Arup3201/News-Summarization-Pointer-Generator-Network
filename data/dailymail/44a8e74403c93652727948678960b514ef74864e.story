Fears of violent clashed between Yes and No supporters have been raised after pubs were granted special licences to keep serving alcohol all through tomorrow night into Friday morning.

Bars across Scotland which applied for the late licence will now be open throughout the count, which is not supposed to be finished until 6am on Friday at the earliest.

With the mood in Scotland turning increasingly bitter amidst toxic allegations of bullying and intimidation, senior politicians and police officers described the plan for all-night drinking as ‘absolute madness’.

Fears of violence on referendum night have been raised after pubs across Scotland were granted special late licences

Clash: Yes and No supporters face off at a large pro-independence rally

It comes after claims Police Scotland have cancelled all leave as fears of trouble grow – which the force today denied.

One senior officer said there were real concerns that tempers are running so high street fighting could break out between Yes and No supporters, particularly in built up areas.

He told The Times: ‘If it’s a No vote there is concern it will get ugly.

‘The Yes campaign has been quite vociferous and there is a gut feeling they are already using any excuse to make trouble.

‘Houses with No signs still up will be particularly vulnerable, especially if people have been drinking for most of the day.’

Aggressive intimidation has increasingly been a feature of the Yes campaign.

Pro-union voters have endured stone-throwing, been called traitors and faced threats that their houses will be torched.

Homes with ‘No Thanks’ posters have been pelted with eggs and one householder in Edinburgh had ‘coward’ etched into his front door;

The Yes campaign has been heavily criticised by Better Together for bullying and intimidation 

The Golden Rule, in Edinburgh, is one of the pubs that has been granted a late licence. It says it will only allow new customers in after 1am to reduce the risk of trouble breaking out.

Pro-union canvassers been called ‘loyalist scum’ and ordered to hand over details of supporters so their ‘houses can be burned down’.

Even farmers have received anonymous phone calls saying their livestock will be set loose unless they take down campaign boards.

With so many threats coming from the Yes side, senior politicians also heavily criticised the decision to grant late licences.

Scottish Conservatives justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell said: ‘Whichever way this goes there will be some disappointed people and alcohol and high emotions don't really mix

Graeme Pearson, Scottish Labour's justice spokesman, added: ‘I don't know why there is a need to access alcohol on a night when such a serious decision is being taken.’

Many of the pubs that have been granted the extended licence claimed there were measures in place to try and reduce the likelihood of trouble.

The Kilderkin in Edinburgh is considering serving beer with a low alcohol content, The Golden Rule also in Edinburgh will not allow new customers in after 1am.

The Radical Road, also in Edinburgh, will only allow Yes supporters in, to try and reduce the chances of trouble sparking between rival voters.

Police Scotland, which denied all leave had been cancelled, said arrangements for the night are ‘in hand’.

Concerns have also been raised of a run on ATMs if Scotland  votes for independence.

It is still not clear what currency would be used in an independent Scotland, meaning that some Scots could rush to withdraw as many pounds as possible in the event of a Yes vote.

In anticipation of the poll, extra supplies of cash have been moved north of the border to reassure Scottish account-holders that they will have access to their money, according to reports.

Meanwhile, a pledge by David Cameron to maintain Scotland’s controversial public spending formula was yesterday branded by Conservative MPs as a ‘last-minute bribe’.

Senior Tories warned the Prime Minister faces a ‘deferred bloodbath’ over the inducements offered to the Scots to persuade them to stay in the UK.

Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a ‘vow’ to the people of Scotland, including a guarantee to continue the Barnett allocation – which sees the Scots get more than £1,300 per head in public spending above the UK average.

 But even Lord Barnett, who devised the formula in 1979, said last night that it was ‘grossly unfair’ and should be scrapped.
