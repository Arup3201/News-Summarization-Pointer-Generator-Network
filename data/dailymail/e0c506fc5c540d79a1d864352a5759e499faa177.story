Counter-terrorism police have asked business owners and members of the public to shop anarchists living in their neighbourhood.

A bulletin was released by the Metropolitan police, aimed at alerting locals to levels of threat in the UK from groups including al-Qaeda and Irish-related terrorists. It also gave a security update after the attacks in Norway last month where 76 people died.

The notice was made available by the City of Westminster force last week and included a warning about anarchism, a political philosophy.

The release is issued by Project Griffin, an initiative to protect communities from the threat of terrorism.

There was no warning about other political groups but next to an image of the anarchist emblem, it reads: 'Anarchism is a political philosophy which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or anarchy.

'Any information relating to anarchists should be reported to your local police.'

The only other image included in the bulletin is one used by al-Qaeda in Iraq. Police asked the public to report any of these seen in the capital.

There have been questions as to whether police appearing to criminalise a set of political beliefs constitutes a breach of human rights.

Members of the anarchist community criticised the disproportionate response.

Yodet Gherez, a member of All London Anarchist Revolutionary Movement (Alarm) who presents a radio show on Resonance FM called The Circle A, said: 'Anarchism is about building a mass movement for social change like the anti-cuts movement.

'The police are trying to demonise us with the same brush as Islamic fundamentalists when we are the opposite of that.

'The reason why the police are acting this way is because they are scared our ideas are becoming more popular.'

The Metropolitan Police was unable to issue a comment at this time.
