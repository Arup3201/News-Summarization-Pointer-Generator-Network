A mother who downloaded five minutes of a film on her phone while abroad for her poorly son has been handed a £1,118 bill.

Stacey Withers, 25, has said getting the clip from cartoon Madagascar 3 has cost her more than the week's family break to Turkey they were on.

The dental nurse had downloaded the DreamWorks film to cheer up 
three-year-old Joel who fell ill with an ear infection during the 
holiday two weeks ago.

In shock: Stacey Withers downloaded the film 'Madagascar' for her poorly son, Joel, which cost her more than £1,100

But she was left devastated when she 
discovered the short clip had cost her a whopping £1,118 - £101 more
than the family holiday and the equivalent of £223 for every minute
of the film.

Popular: Madagascar is much-loved by children all over the world and was the only thing that would calm poorly Joel

The mother-of-one, who had saved for two years for the trip has refused to pay, blasting Orange's bill as 'extortionate'.

'It's absolutely disgusting,' she said.

'My three-year-old son had been crying for nearly six days because of an ear infection.

'He is mad for Madagascar and I knew it was the only thing that might get him to calm down.

'I turned on data roaming for about five minutes and started to download it and got about 18 per cent.

'I
started to worry it would cost me a few hundred - so I stopped the 
download and waited until I had wifi inside the hotel to download the 
rest.

'When we landed home on Monday, I got a text from Orange updating me on my bill.

'I was expecting it to be bad, maybe up to £300 for the download but I couldn't believe it when it said £1,118.

'It has completely ruined the holiday - that's more than I earn in a month.

'The holiday cost £1,100 and I had been saving for it for about two years.

'I'm outraged and I won't be paying it.'

Stacey had gone on holiday with her partner Danny Langford, 23, and three-year-old son Joel earlier this month. 

Hit hard: The mother-of-one admitted she knew 
the download, left, would cost her but she is refusing to pay the amount
that she has been charged for five minutes of video

Joel picked up an ear infection from the flight over to Oludeniz, in Turkey and was ill for six out of the seven-day break.

Contact your network operator before you leave: Often they have cheaper bundles or tariffs available if you know you're going abroad

Ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use, to stop your bill spiraling.

Turn off auto-updating of apps or email retrieval: Again this means you won't use any data allowance

Use mobile websites instead of full desktop view: This will save data per page

Turn off data roaming all together: If you don't want to use the internet when you're away

Stacey, of Tipton, West Midlands, forked out a further £10 to downloaded the film from Playstore.

She
added: 'I tried to reason with Orange on the phone and I offered them 
£300 but said I simply couldn't afford to pay the huge bill.

'They were so rude.

'They told me I had been warned about it when I arrived in Turkey with a text message.

'I didn't dispute the text messages but for five minutes of a download to be charged that much is just extortionate.

'I had been with them for ten years, a very loyal customer and they have just cut me off.'

Orange today stood by the bill.

A
spokesman said: 'Customers are automatically capped to ensure they 
are not charged more than £51 for roaming data in a given month.

'In this instance the customer contacted Orange to opt out of the cap.'

Last month a British holidaymaker racked up a 
staggering £20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to 
upload holiday snaps to Facebook.

Shocked
Helen Christie, 40, was landed with the massive bill, which is 28 times
the amount she paid for her holiday, when she decided to share photos 
of her trip to Turkey on the social network.

But
by using her Orange mobile internet to upload the pictures, she ran up 
data roaming charges which worked out at huge £2,700 per day.

Helen, of Woolwich, 
South East London, had planned for her trip by buying £6 per day 'travel
saver' mobile internet bundle from her network provider.

But Orange said that by buying into 
the deal, she had opted out of the cap on her normal tariff, which 
limits internet charges to £42 per day.

Upon her return, the mother-of-two was faced with monthly repayments of £3,000.

Shocked: Helen Christie, above, was enjoying a week away with pals when she ran up the bill

A schoolgirl enjoying a dream holiday 
ran up a £3,800 bill after uploading pictures of her trip onto Facebook 
with her mobile phone this summer.

Casey Snook, 14, used the website to post regular updates about her time in New York.

She
eagerly told friends about her visits to the Empire State Building, 
Central Park and Times Square and uploaded a series of pictures with her
iPhone.

But she was unaware
of the massive bill until her father’s bank account - which funded the 
phone - suddenly went overdrawn after the holiday.

Phone company Orange said she 
ran up the charges by using Facebook with data roaming - a service which
enables internet access abroad.

Her mother, Kate Snook, 43, a catering assistant, accused the company of 'extortion'.
