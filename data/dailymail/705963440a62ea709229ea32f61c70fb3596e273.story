We should, perhaps, forgive the poor naive men who think women spend their 'time of the month' horse-riding along beaches, rollerblading and skydiving, and that period blood is blue.

For there are, it seems, a few of them out there.

One of these is Richard Neill, a disillusioned boyfriend who light-heartedly bemoaned being mis-sold the truth about menstruation on Bodyform's Facebook page, and who has received feedback from the company in the form of a hilarious spoof YouTube video which has gone viral.

Mr Neill penned a Facebook wall missive to feminine hygiene brand Bodyform on 8 October, explaining how confused their advert for sanitary products made him.

He said that as a boy he watched jolly, carefree women cavorting along the beach and hurling themselves out of planes, having 'blue water' periods that gave them fun-sounding 'wings', all to the backdrop of that age-old aural ear-worm: the 'Woah Bodyform, Bodyformed for you!' song.

He went on to explain how acquiring a girlfriend later in life had exposed the horrible truth about periods, and how they actually transformed his 'loving, gentle, normal skin coloured lady to the little girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin'.

His witty tale of woe prompted much amusement on the social networking site, and his message has, to date, received 86,743 'likes' and 3,735 comments.

Posted on Bodyform's Facebook page on 8 October:

'Hi, as a man I must ask why you have lied to us for all these years.

'As
 a child I watched your advertisements with interest as to how at this 
wonderful time of the month that the female gets to enjoy so many 
things, I felt a little jealous.

'I
 mean bike riding, rollercoasters, dancing, parachuting, why couldn't I 
get to enjoy this time of joy and 'blue water' and wings!! Dam my 
penis!!

'Then I got a girlfriend, was so happy and couldn't wait for this joyous adventurous time of the month to happen .....you lied !!

'There was no joy, no extreme sports, no blue water spilling over wings and no rocking soundtrack oh no no no.

'Instead
 I had to fight against every male urge I had to resist screaming 
wooaaahhhhh bodddyyyyyyfooorrrmmm bodyformed for youuuuuuu as my lady 
changed from the loving, gentle, normal skin coloured lady to the little
 girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin.

'Thanks for setting me up for a fall bodyform, you crafty b@gger'

Caroline Williams explains that the depictions of women rollerblading and having pillow fights during their periods are in fact metaphors

In response Bodyform spotted a golden PR opportunity and yesterday released a hilarious 
YouTube video retort, conceived by their advertising agency Carat.

'Bodyform Responds: The Truth' is a two minute clip
 in which company 'boss' Caroline Williams (actually played by an 
actress) sits down to explain the truth about periods to Richard.

Posted on their Facebook page, the 
video - which went viral overnight - shows Bodyform's 'CEO' sitting at 
her desk with a jug of blue water.

Addressing Richard she says: 'Hello Richard. We read your Facebook post with interest, but 
also a sense of foreboding - and I think it's time we came clean. We 
lied to you, Richard. And I want to say sorry.'

Ms
 Williams then breaks the news to Richard that Bodyform's prolific use of 
skydiving and mountain bike-riding in their adverts was actually metaphorical, an illusion used to represent periods because men 'can't 
handle the truth'.

Richard Neill's original post on Facebook, in which he complained about the lies he was being sold regarding periods by Bodyform's adverts

'There's no such thing as a happy 
period,' she says, going on to explain how a series of focus groups in 
the 1980s proved that 'the cramps, the mood-swings, the insatiable hunger,
 and yes, Richard, the blood coursing from our uteri like a crimson 
landslide' were all too much for men to really bear.

The spoof video - which has so far notched up 135,036 views on YouTube, 2,213 Facebook 'likes' and 211 comments - ends with the CEO thanking Richard for lifting the veil on their lies and exposing the truth.

SCA, manufacturers of Bodyform, and the brand's advertising agency Carat, co-ordinated the idea for the video response. The concept was scripted and filmed by Rubber Republic.

Yulia Kretova, Brand Controller, at 
Bodyform said: 'We found Richard's post very amusing and wanted to 
continue the positive dialogue around periods that this generated.

'Working with the brand for five years breaking down the taboo around Bodyform and periods has always been a challenge and I hope that we have started to address this.

'Carat has created an original and uniquely personalised response, brilliantly PR-ed by Myriad, allowing Bodyform to quickly engage in consumer conversations in a meaningful way.'

Rachael Lake, Communications Planning Manager at Carat said: 'Bodyform's advertisements have a long, distinguished history that we wanted to build on in our film.

'Our carefully crafted response to the Facebook post is deliberately playful and uses video to present a humorous and spirited take on an often slightly taboo subject.'

Katie
 Hibbard, Social Media Planner at Ogilvy advertising agency, told 
MailOnline: 'This really shows how brands can best use social media - 
responding quickly, to a topical subject, by creating content that is 
innately shareable.

'The 
sense of humour Bodyform have used shows that the brand truly 
understands its target audience, I think they've done an amazing job.'
