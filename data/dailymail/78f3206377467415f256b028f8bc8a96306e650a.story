It's an image that has never gone away since it was first circulated in 2010 - a huge pouring of synthetic pink soft serve-like matter falling into a cardboard box that was purportedly the filling on McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.

And, despite announcements time and time again the ubiquitous image of pink goop had nothing to do with McDonald's, the fast food giant continues to try to dispel the myth.

This week the world's largest restaurant chain released a video that was filmed inside one of their nugget factories in Cargill, Canada.

It purports to detail the start-to-finish process of how McDonald's manufactures their best-selling snacks.

The image that sparked an outrage: This photo, first circulated in 2010, purported to show the filling of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The fast food giant continues to try and dispel the myth

Step one: Workers start to de-bone the raw chickens

According to McDonald's the chicken meat is separated because only the breast is used in their nuggets

The breast meat is then collected and prepared for shredding

The breast meat is mixed with seasoning and chicken skin and put through a shredder, as seen here

The resultant mixture is then further blended

The process starts with the chickens being de-boned and the breast meat separated.

McDonald's maintains that only breast meat is used in their nuggets.

The meat is then shredded before being mixed in with seasoning and chicken skin.

McDonalds' Canada chain supply manager Nicoletta Stefou shows a picture of the infamous 'pink goop' photo on an iPad at one point to show how it differs from the 'real' mixture.

The meat is then cut into the four nugget shapes - the bell, the ball, the boot and the bow tie.

They are twice battered and partially fried.

The nuggets will be properly cooked at the restaurant outlets in deep fryers.

Finally, they are bagged, boxed, frozen and shipped.

As of 2012, there are more than 33,000 restaurants around the world, in 118 countries.

More 14,000 of those restaurants are in the United States.

The mix is then cut into the four McNugget shapes - the bell, the ball, the boot and the bow tie

The nuggets are first battered lightly and then covered in a thicker tempura mixture

The nuggets are then partially fried so the batter can set against the chicken

A worker demonstrates the mix inside the finished nugget is the same as what was seen earlier

The nuggets will be properly cooked at the restaurant outlets, so they are bagged up and then frozen

Finally, the nuggets are boxed up and prepared for shipping
