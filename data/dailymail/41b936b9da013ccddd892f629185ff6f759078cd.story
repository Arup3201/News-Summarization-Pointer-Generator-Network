A 68-year-old woman was rescued by an RAF helicopter after she fell 30ft during a tour of Wells Cathedral in Somerset.

A Sea King helicopter was scrambled to the 775-year-old cathedral after the woman became 'wedged between two turrets' having fallen from 150ft up during a 'High Parts Tour'.

Emergency services were called and a doctor from the ambulance service abseiled down to treat the woman before she was winched up to safety on a spineboard and taken for medical treatment.

Drama at the cathedral: A 68-year-old woman was winched to safety after falling from 150ft up during a tour

Belted into a spineboard, the woman was winched up to the RAF Sea King and taken to hospital for treatment

The woman was wedged for around three-and-a-half hours after falling from 150ft up just after midday today

A rescuer was first winched down to help the woman before she was winched up just after 3.30pm

A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said the woman was trapped in a void between two walls 150ft up inside the bell tower.

The woman, who has not yet been named, was said to have suffered hip, arm and leg injuries but nothing life-threatening in the accident, which happened just after midday today.  She was said to be in a state of shock.

She was one of a group of 12 adults taking part in the High Parts Tour, which offers visitors the chance to climb to the top of the cathedral and enjoy views over Glastonbury Tor and the Somerset Levels.

A cathedral spokesman said tours were cancelled pending a safety review, and visitors were asked to stay away from the historic building as the rescue operation took place.

The spokesman said: 'A group of 12 adults were undertaking the final stage of a standard Cathedral High Parts Tour. 

'While the group was undertaking a briefing within this space, an incident occurred to one of the party members.

'The
 Cathedral's emergency procedure was immediately put into operation and 
emergency services are now in attendance, including the air ambulance.

The woman's injuries were said not to be life-threatening but she had hurt her arm and pelvis in the fall

'No details are yet available as to how the incident occurred but all further high parts tours and cathedral tower tours are cancelled until further notice while a review of the incident takes place.'

An Avon and Somerset Police spokeswoman said a helicopter was scrambled by the ARCC in RAF Kinloss in the north of Scotland before airlifting the woman to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with what are believed to be arm and pelvic injuries.

A Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue spokesman said appliances from Wells, Shepton Mallet, Bridgwater and Street were in attendance and were working alongside paramedics and a doctor.

Melanie Glanville of South Western Ambulance said the woman had hip, arm and leg injuries but they were not thought to be life-threatening.

She added: 'One of the specialist doctors from the ambulance team has abseiled down to reach her.'
