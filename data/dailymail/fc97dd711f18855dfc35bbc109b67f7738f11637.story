Police in Madrid have arrested two Schalke fans after a scuffle broke out between officers and supporters on the eve of their Champions League second-leg clash with Real Madrid.

The German club have over 3,000 fans in the Spanish capital as they looked to overcome a 2-0 defecit from the first leg in Gelsenkirchen - and some had been enjoying the hospitality of the city's bars the night before the game.

But fights broke out after police tried to shepherd fans off the streets and into a bar in the Puerta del Sol square, which then saw beer thrown over officers who reacted to stop the trouble.

One supporter was arrested and put into a police car in the square, covered in blood from the melee that ensued while another was also later arrested.

Schalke supporters are known for the vocal backing of their team, often travelling in huge numbers for away trips across Europe.

Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo at the Veltins-Arena effectively settled the tie before the half-way point last month, with European champions Real expected to easily see off their German opponents.
