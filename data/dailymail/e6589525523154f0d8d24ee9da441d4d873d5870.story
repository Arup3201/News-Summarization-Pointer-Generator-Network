Singer M.I.A. is fighting off a $16.6million (£10million) lawsuit over making an offensive gesture during an appearance at the Super Bowl half-time show in 2012.

The British-Sri Lankan artist, 38, raised her middle finger and swore at the camera while performing alongside Madonna and Nicki Minaj, which led to the U.S. National Football League taking legal action.

After initially demanding M.I.A. pay a $1.5million 'breach of contract' fine, the NFL are now asking for a further $15.1million.

'It
 ridiculous' Singer M.I.A. is now being sued for an additional $15.1m, on top of a $1.5million fine for 'breaching her contract' for flipping the bird and swearing during the 2012 Super Bowl performance

M.I.A sang a verse on Madonna’s Give 
Me All Your Luvin’ during the 2012 Super Bowl half-time show, appearing 
on stage for two minutes and ten seconds.

The
 NFL argue that this short cameo would be worth $15.1million had it been
 a TV advertisement, and so is suing M.I.A. for the sum.

The
 steep increase comes after M.I.A. took the legal battle public in 
September last year and released a YouTube video in which she accused 
the NFL of turning her into a scapegoat and that the behaviour of the 
teenage cheerleaders at the game was much worse.

She
 said Madonna herself had hired under-16 dancers who had 'cheerleader 
outfits, hips thrusted in the air, legs wide open, in this very sexually
 provocative position.'

M.I.A.’s
 legal team has responded to the demands by calling it an attempt to 
‘bully’ the artist, and accuse the sports organisation of ‘making an 
example of her for daring to challenge the NFL’.

Rude: The singer flipped her middle finger and mouthed 'I don't give a s***' at a cameraman during her appearance with Madonna 
and Nicki Minaj at the 2012 sporting event

‘The claim for restitution lacks any basis in law, fact, or logic,' the performer's response papers read.

'[The]
 continued pursuit of this proceeding is transparently an exercise by 
the NFL intended solely to bully and make an example of Respondents for 
daring to challenge NFL.'

1993 - The first controversial performance involving a Jackson sees The King of Pop stand motionless on stage for a full one minute and 13 seconds.

2004 - Now known as 'Nipplegate', the half-time show saw Michael's sister Janet suffer an infamous 'wardrobe malfunction' as she was performing with Justin Timberlake.

Timberlake was supposed to rip off a part of Jackson's leather bustier to expose a red bra - but ended up showing the world Janet's naked breast for 9/16ths of a second.

For this, CBS was fined $550,000 by the Federal Communications Commission.

2009 - Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band performs in Tampa, and The Boss crotch-slams a TV camera.

2013 - The New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome suffers a blackout after Beyonce's half-time performance when she reunited Destiny's Child.

M.I.A.
 - real name Maya Arulpragasam - wasn't paid for her performance at the 
2012 event, but did have to enter an agreement acknowledging 'the great 
value of the goodwill associated with the NFL and the tremendous public 
respect and reputation for wholesomeness enjoyed by the NFL.'

The
 contract added 'all elements of performance, including without 
limitation wardrobe, shall be consistent with such goodwill and 
reputation.'

The NFL filed 
their complaint with the American Arbitration Association in March 2012,
 despite broadcaster NBC and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
 both saying they would take no further action.

The
 complaint calls the middle-finger an 'offensive gesture' which is 'in 
flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the NFL 
brand and the Super Bowl.'

The
 singer - best known for the hit song Paper Planes - flipped her middle 
finger and swore into the camera during her rap solo as over 100 million
 fans around the world watched the performance.

While
 all eyes were on Madonna during the now infamous performance back in 
2012, broadcasters were caught by surprise by the singer and scrambled 
to obscure the gesture in time.

The screen briefly went blurry in 
what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the camera shot and Madonna, 
who at this point was lying on her back behind the rapper, appearing 
blissfully unaware of the controversial move.

The NFL, which produces the show, and the broadcaster, NBC, both apologised immediately but blamed each other for the incident.

Fighting back: M.I.A's lawyer, Howard King, last week said that his client was planning to fight back against the NFL who imposed the fine

Brian McCarthy, the league's vice president of communications, said: 'There was a failure in NBC's delay system.

'The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.'

NBC's spokesperson countered: 'The NFL hired the talent and produced the half-time show.

'Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers.'

Shortly after the performance, a source inside M.I.A.'s camp claimed the rapper was struck with 'a case of adrenaline and nerves.'

'She wasn't thinking,' said the source, who requested anonymity but was with the artist at Lucas Oil Stadium. 'It wasn't any kind of statement.

'She was caught in the moment and she's incredibly sorry.'

The controversy mirrors that caused by Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during the 2004 show, which put CBS in hot water with the Federal Communications Commission.

The singer was performing with Justin Timberlake when he ripped open her costume to expose her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second, a moment for which CBS was fined $550,000 by the FCC.
