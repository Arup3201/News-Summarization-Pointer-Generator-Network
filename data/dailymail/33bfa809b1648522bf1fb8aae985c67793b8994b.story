British households are set to enjoy more disposable income as the economy stages a recovery and consumer spending power receives a welcome boost, according to a major think tank.

The figures by the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed that consumer spending is expected to rise by 1.5 per cent helping growth to reach its highest point since 2007.

It predicts that real household disposable income will reverse the 0.6 per cent fall of last year.

His plan: Chancellor George Osborne will welcome the news as proof that his economic plan for Britain is finally working

Chancellor George Osborne will welcome the news as proof that his economic plan for Britain is finally working.

But critics suggest that many people simply do not feel better off and many more are struggling to pay the bills and afford basic necessities.

According to the consultancy's report, the economy hit two key important benchmarks last week which will help households to feel better off.

Unemployment fell below the 7 per cent 
threshold set by the Bank of England as the litmus test for raising 
interest rates - something which was recently changed.

Ed Miliband: Labour is warning that there is still a 'cost of living crisis'

Labour has warned that there is still a 'cost of living crisis' despite the recent round of positive economic news.

Even the Chancellor sounded a note of caution, admitting that millions of people still face pressures on their budgets - in acceptance that Ed Miliband's claims of a 
cost of living crisis resonates with millions of cash-strapped voters.

The Bank of England had pledged not to lift interest rates until there was a fall in unemployment to 7 per cent.

But
 that policy of forward guidance has now been abandoned after 
joblessness declined much quicker than had been expected, with that 
target reached, as growth picked up speed last year.

Rate-setters
 are now using a new ‘fuzzy’ guidance linking monetary policy to a more 
opaque measure of how far the economy is running below its capacity.

Interest rates have been left unchanged at
 0.5 per cent, as Bank of England policymakers allow the UK's
 recovery to gather pace.

The Bank's monetary policy committee
now has the luxury of leaving rates at their five-year record low.

While the news on employment and record low rates, is welcome, over 15 million households are 
financially vulnerable, struggling to cope with monthly bills and 
constantly worried about losing their jobs, a poll has found.

According to a poll by debt charity Stepchange around 15million people are ‘living on the edge,’ despite the improving economy.

For
 many people, the problem is that they are either falling behind on 
bills or are trying to plug gaps in their income by using credit to pay 
for essential outgoings.

Many blame this on an uneven recovery, heavily reliant on household consumption.

However, the report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research suggests that the economic recovery will now be more balanced.

It may even lead the Chancellor to offer tax cuts worth up to £7billion.

Last year, household consumption accounted for 80 per cent of the overall growth, but that figure is expected to be halved as businesses spend more.

Meanwhile, investment in British businesses is predicted to surge 10.1 per cent in real terms over the course of this year.

Another buoyant driver of growth is the business sector which has remained strong, particularly construction with plenty of house building taking place.

On an annual basis, construction output rose 2.8 percent in February compared with a 5.7 percent increase in January, according to the Office for national Statistics.

But soggy weather throughout Britain in 
February put a dampener on the construction trade as output shrank.

Despite this, the consultancy has pushed up its growth forecast from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent.

The
 construction industry is seen as a good indicator of the health of the 
overall British economy as construction accounts for 6.3 per cent of 
gross domestic product.

Elsewhere, consumer confidence in the UK is growing according to Deloitte which said that confidence had reached its highest level in two years in the first quarter of 2014.
