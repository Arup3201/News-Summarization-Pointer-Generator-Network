The continuing fight for life of North America's bears has been captured in spectacular style in a series of dramatic pictures.

Grizzly, polar and black bears are pictured in the wilds of Alaska scavenging in bins, stripping a whale carcass and scrapping over the best fishing spots.

Photographer Steven Kazlowski has spent the past 15 years living in bear country and capturing 
the most intimate, hilarious and adrenaline-fuelled moments of his furry
 subjects.

Surveying its kingdom: The breathtaking image shows an adult grizzly on the look out on the riverside in Alaska with the dramatic mountains set behind

Bear necessities: A grizzly bear is pictured playing with a rare blond bear at Katmai National Park in Katmai. It is unusual for the two varieties to interact in that way

The series by the 43-year-old also features the more fun side of the creatures.

Cubs are seen play fighting, scrapping over food and cuddling up together.

One stunning picture shows a rare blond bear wrestling a more common brown grizzly at Katmai National Park in Katmai, Alaska.

His favourites have now been compiled into a new book called Bear Country.

He said one of the highlights was capturing the blond bear on camera.

Piggy back: A pair of grizzly bear cubs play together in the long grass of the national park. They were captured by photographer Steven Kazlowski for a new book

Three little bears: The trio of cubs stand on their hind legs, left, looking for their mother and then cuddle together on the river bank as she goes salmon fishing

Face-off: A pair of adult grizzly bear fight for supremacy as they roar and show their teeth at one another to try and win territory and the best fishing spot

The American said: 'A blond grizzly bear is an extremely rare occurrence.

'What we see in the pictures is an 
even rarer-sight of a blond coloured grizzly bear interacting with a 
standard brown coloured grizzly bear.

'They are actually not fighting, but are playing on a huge tidal mudflat.

'This went on for several hours until the afternoon sun eventually set.

'They then went from playing to fishing for food.'

Picturesque: A mother black bear walks with her cubs in front of the beautiful Exit Glacier at Kenai Fjords National Park in Kenai, Alaska

Peek-a-boo: A black bear cub keeps an eye on its
 surroundings as it sits in a tree in Tongass National Forest, Alaska, 
while a larger bear adopts a more relaxed pose

Fine dining: A hungry grizzly bear and her two cubs scavenge for food at a huge dumpster in Deadhorse, Alaska. There are thought to be about 200,000 grizzlies

'People find it unbelievable that I have had these experiences and captured these images.

'They often cannot imagine being in that situation, and I feel my images allow a window into my experience.'

Among the other intimate moments caught 
on camera are a polar bear appearing to wave at the camera and a pair of
 male grizzlies going head-to-head as they fight for territory.

One particularly stunning picture shows a mother black bear and her two cubs walking past a glacier.

Mr Kazlowski said: 'All of these images strike a deep chord within me as they all represent a high level of nature and wildlife photography.

Anyone in there? A large polar bear shows off its enormous paws as it curiously peers into a truck window at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in North Slope, Alaska

Feeling lazy: A polar bear takes a break from hunting and rolls around and stretches in the snow. Numbers of the species are very low as polar ice continues to melt

Tug of war: Two cubs cling on to the skin of a bowhead whale as they play on the snow. Photographer Steven Kazlowski spent 15 years following North America's bears

Give us a wave: A polar bear cub appears to be waving at the camera as it tries to balance on its hind legs. But an adult has no trouble as it reaches its full 10ft height

Dinner time: Birds circle overhead as a polar bear and her two cubs scavenge from the remains of a bowhead whale

US photographer Steve Kazlowski's new book features the best pictures taken during his 15 year career

'Every image has a story behind it.

'The stories are explained visually in the book - with great composition, great lighting, great behaviour and action.

The most common species is the black bear, with over a million believed to survive in the wild.

Grizzly bear numbers are thought to total 200,000 and are not at risk of extinction at this time.

Polar bears, however, are endangered.

There are currently only an estimated
 25,000 polar bears left in the wild as the ice they depend for hunting 
continues to disappear.

Nature-lover Mr Kazlowski said he wanted to release the book to reveal the softer side of the creature that is normally hidden from view.

He said: 'My message is pretty simple - it's that these animals are not cold blooded killers.

'We can peacefully coexist with bears, and enjoy a richer world with the diversity in species they offer us.

'My goal is to create awareness and 
promote conservation of natural environments by making striking images 
that connect people to places and animals.

'Telling stories like these through book projects is a basis for educating people about animals and their environments.'

Steve's book, Bear Country: North America's Grizzly, Black and Polar Bears is available in Hardback for Â£12, from Amazon.
