If in May you had told Aston Villa supporters their team would head into the fifth match of this season unbeaten and standing second in the Barclays Premier League there is a good chance the men in white coats would have got a nod.

Owner Randy Lerner had cast a cloak of uncertainty over the club by putting it up for sale, manager Paul Lambert was under pressure from fans restless after another campaign flirting with relegation, and star striker Christian Benteke had ruptured his Achilles tendon.

But football has a way of making the unfathomable happen and in the space of one productive summer, Villa can suddenly embrace positivity again. It is they, after their best start since the 1998-99 season, who look down on Arsenal, Saturday's visitors.

Paul Lambert has managed to turn around the club's fortunes after two struggling seasons at Villa Park

There is reason to keep the optimism cautious of course, the season is young, but it is worth examining how Lambert has altered the atmosphere of the club in such a short space of time.

The 1-0 win at Liverpool last weekend gave credibility to previous victories over Stoke and Hull, alongside the draw with Newcastle. It was a performance built on defensive foundations and tactical clarity.

Clearly, the backline is more secure than previously. Philippe Senderos may not have been a signing to inspire but he has brought organisational skills and experience to the extent that with Ron Vlaar missing at Anfield Nathan Baker, criticised last term, slotted in effectively.

Alan Hutton has been recalled from his two-year exile because finances meant Lambert could defuse his ‘Bomb Squad’ and the Scottish international has been a revelation. Aly Cissokho on the opposite flank has strengthened further. Lambert has raised the average age of the back four from 25 last season to 28.5 this.

His midfield trio is made up of energetic players quick to close spaces. Fabian Delph has flourished, Ashley Westwood is in the form of his career, and Kieran Richardson brings nous. Tom Cleverley adds further quality.

Average possession stands at only 37 per cent and passing success just 72 per cent but as Jose Mourinho, or even Jurgen Klopp, will tell you, it is what a team does with the ball that counts. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan has only faced 10 shots so far, second only to Asmir Begovic at Stoke (6), and has reacted when tested.

‘They look very assured,’ former Villa and England manager Graham Taylor told Sportsmail. ‘It would appear to me they’ve said let’s get it right at the back, let’s have a good base.’

From there Villa have been clinical in attack, remarkably gaining ten points from just six shots on target – the lowest in the division. Four goals have been scored, two each for Gabriel Agbonalhor and Andi Weimann.

Aston Villa have made their best start to the Premier League season since 1998-99...

16 Aug     Stoke City (A)        0-1 

23 Aug     Newcastle (H)        0-0

31 Aug     Hull City (H)           2-1

13 Sep     Liverpool (A)         1-0

Those slender margins cannot continue to prove so fruitful, as Taylor points out, but Benteke has this week returned to training and could push for a place in the squad within a month. His impact would instantly give Villa an added edge.

The recurring name uttered by those associated with the club when asked about Villa’s upturn however belongs to the man Lambert boldly brought in as his No 2.

Roy Keane is said to have impressed everyone at the club with his manner, communication skills and driven attitude. Promising winger Jack Grealish, 19, describes Keane as ‘brilliant’ and tells an illuminating anecdote about his first day of training.

‘I didn’t start the session that well and he tapped me on the shoulder after a half an hour,’ recalls Grealish. ‘He said: “Are you alright?” and I replied “Yeah”. And then he asked me: “When do you start training then?”’

Lambert had no doubts that his close friend Keane would thrive outside of the television studio

Keane has the minerals and the medals to offer players honest appraisals no matter their status and his ferocious winning mentality has permeated the side.

Lambert admitted Keane’s appointment following the dismissal of disliked Ian Culverhouse ‘raised eyebrows’ but added: ‘His knowledge meant he was too good to be a TV pundit. I love working with him, we have a laugh. I beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day.’

Lambert this week signed a new contract keeping him at Villa until at least June 2018 to allay any doubts about his role beyond next summer and it is clear he shares a strong bond with Lerner. ‘I don’t have an agent,’ says Lambert. ‘I trust him. That’s the big thing. There were never any complications.’

In the window Lambert took on extra responsibilities as chief executive Paul Faulkner surprisingly left. Lambert dealt with a number of deals in and out of the club but new chief executive Tom Fox, recruited from Arsenal, will now take the reigns.

Christian Benteke is close to returning from injury and could feature against Arsenal on Saturday

US Owner Randy Lerner (L) has been re-energised and seems less enthusiastic about selling the club

His arrival, and the contracts for Lambert, Hutton and Agbonlahor, indicate Lerner is planning for the long-term even with the ‘For Sale’ sign swinging in the breeze. That should warm the hearts of Villa fans as much as anything.

The American has visited Bodymoor Heath on numerous occasions in the past few months and held meetings with all department heads. Re-energised, is the buzzword used to describe him.

So too are the club’s faithful, who will push Villa Park close to capacity today. Finally they have cause to be cheerful.
