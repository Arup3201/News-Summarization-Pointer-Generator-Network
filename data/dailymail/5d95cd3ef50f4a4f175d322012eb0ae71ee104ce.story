Council officials told a resident who asked for details regarding paranormal activity through a Freedom of Information request that if he had any concerns he should call Ghostbusters.

Staff at Essex County Council offered the response to the request, which asked for information relating to paranormal and zombie activity dealt with by the local authority in the past decade.

However, the council responded to the anonymous request by saying information about the services in question was contracted out to external providers.

Dr Stantz, Dr Venkman and Dr Spengler, played by actors Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis in the film Ghostbusters. Essex County Council replied to an FOI request on paranormal activity saying anybody with concerns should call Ghostbusters

The request and the response given by Essex County Council when asked about UFO sightings and paranormal activity 

And the response then read: 'For all investigation concerning paranormal activity please contact 555-2368 Ghostbusters and ask to speak with Dr Venkman, Dr Stantz or Dr Spengler.”

The doctors mentioned are the ghost-hunting characters played by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis in 1980s blockbuster film Ghostbusters.

Other requests within the FOI for information on UFO sightings, zombie attacks and pandemics were referred to Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, Shaun from zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead and Major Henry West from 28 Days Later.

The anonymous Freedom of Information request was received last month but the response was only published today.

Information requested included the number of UFO sightings over the past decade and any contingency plans in place to protect the personal information of staff and clients 'should there be an invasion of zombies or any kind of viral infection that could cause a pandemic'.

The letter also referred the resident to Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, pictured, played by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, with concerns about UFO sightings 

The mystery requester was told: 'For information regarding UFO sightings please contact Fox Mulder or Dana Scully who have been seconded from the FBI to Essex County Council X-Files project.'

Zombie requests were directed to Shaun at The Winchester Tavern, South London - the favourite pub of Simon Pegg’s character in zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead.

While information on ‘viral pandemics’ was referred to Major Henry West from Danny Boyle’s post-apocalyptic horror film, 28 Days Later.

But the respondent was warned: “Major Henry can only be contacted 28 days later from the receipt of this response.'

The response also said that zombie requests should be directed to Simon Pegg's character, Shaun, pictured, from the zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead 

And when asked if the response was in fact a true response, a council spokesman said: 'That was our official response.'

Earlier this year, Essex County Council leader, David Finch, spoke out about the amount of money the council wasted responding to ‘trivial’ Freedom of Information requests.

Each request must be responded to within 20 working days and can cost taxpayers up to £450 a time in labour costs.

The FOI response said any concerns relating to pandemics should be forwarded to Major Henry West, the character played by Christopher Eccleston in the film 28 Days Later 

A spokesman for Essex County Council also said: 'Earlier this year ECC revealed it spent almost £250,000 dealing with FOI responses in 2013.

'It has seen a 60 per cent increase in FOI requests between 2011 and 2013.

'In 2011 dealing with requests took up 436 officer days. By 2013 this figure had increased to almost 700.

'During the first three months of 2014, we received around 750 requests which, if the trend continues, would result in 3,000 requests received this year.'
