Take aim: Former Tucson Mayoral Candidate Shaun McClusky supports a program that will give free shotguns to residents of high-crime areas of Tucson

A program to hand out weapons in high-crime areas in the same town where Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others were shot has caused sharp criticism from gun control advocates. 

The Armed Citizens Project was backed by former Tucson, Arizona mayoral candidate Shaun McClusky, a Republican, who said that he wants to have at least 36 people in these neighborhoods armed with shotguns and trained in the next two months.

It is controversial in no small part because Tucson is the city where Rep Gabrielle Giffords was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting spree that left six people, including a nine-year-old girl, dead.

The Republican told FoxNews.com that all of the reviews he’s heard of the program have been positive, and that he’s raised more than $12,000 already.

He’s offering the single-shot shotguns to anyone who lives in mid-to-high-risk neighborhoods and can pass a background check, and is hoping to focus on high-crime areas like Midvale Park, Pueblo Gardens, and the Grant-Campbell area, which he said is ‘rampant’ with break-ins.

The guns themselves cost around $200, while training, ammunition, and cleaning supplies would run the cost up to around $350 per person, per gun.

‘Right now, the criminal element is winning,’ he said, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

But Mr McClusky’s views are deeply unpopular with state politicians. ‘To suggest that giving away…loaded shotguns in high-crime areas will make anybody safer is pure idiocy,’ councilman Steve Kozachik said, according to the Star.

‘(The Republican party) is totally out of touch with the values of this city.’

The councilman said that background checks would do little to keep these weapons out of the wrong hands, and would contribute to violence in crime-ravaged areas. 

Councilwoman Regina Romero agreed, saying that Mr McClusky’s assessment of some of Tucson’s neighborhoods is ‘stereotyping.’

She told the Star: ‘McClusky…is reckless in promoting such a ridiculous idea. If he wants to hand out guns to people, why doesn’t he hand them out around the neighborhood?’

The Armed Citizens Project was founded by Kyle Coplen, a University of Houston graduate student, who defends the initiative.

‘We’re not just tossing a bunch of shotguns into a community and walking away,’ he said.

‘What we’re doing is finding residents who are interested in protecting themselves.’ 

He added that there are plans to expand the project to other cities, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Indianapolis. 

Two years ago, then Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was making an appearance at a Safeway for a meet-and-greet event when gunman Jared Lee Loughner opened fire on the event.

Loughner killed six people, including nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green.

Rep. Giffords was shot at point-blank range in the head, but miraculously survived the shooting. 

After two years of intensive care and physical therapy, the former congresswoman still struggles with speech and movement.

She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, have launched an initiative called the Americans for Responsible Solutions, demanding harsher gun control laws in the wake of other mass shootings such as last summer’s Aurora theater shooting and December’s Sandy Hook massacre. 

According to neighborhoodscout.com, Tucson has 3,492 violent crimes every year, with nearly 30,000 property crimes, or around 6.64 crimes per 1,000 residents. 

Arizona State University professor Travis Pratt, who teaches criminology, told the Star that study after study has shown that guns have only succeeded in increasing crimes.

‘There is no credible evidence at all that providing a high-crime area with the instruments to facilitate more crime is going to have any net social benefits,’ he said.
