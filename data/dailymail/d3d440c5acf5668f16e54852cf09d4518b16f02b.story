Carlos Tevez has become the latest footballer to try his hand into the fashion world with the launch of his new headwear.

The Juventus striker uploaded an Instagram post to his account on Tuesday posing in his own customised snapback hat.

In what appears to be a new range of the 31-year-old, the Argentine's hat is emblazoned with 'TVZ 32' across the front - in an abbreviation of his surname and the number of his jerseys worn at West Ham, Manchester United and their 'noisy neighbours' City.

Tevez's time at City also seems to be referenced along the peak of the hat - with the Etihad outfit's infamous 'Welcome to Manchester' poster depicted in white upon the black background.

While the hat may not be easy on the eye to some, the same couldn't be said for Tevez's free-kick in their 1-1 draw at Roma on Monday night.

The forward's beautifully-curled effort gave Juve the lead at their Serie A titles rivals in the second half. 

Speaking after the match, Tevez admitted he had learned how to become a dead-ball specialist from club team-mate Andrea Pirlo.

'I copied [Andrea] Pirlo,' he told the Gazetta dello Sport. 'I watch him every day in training and tried to copy him.

'But when he returns, he will take them again. He is a specialist and I have to respect that.'

It was not enough to win the match, though, as Seydou Keita headed Roma level with 12 minutes to play, earning a share of the spoils between Serie A's top two.

'We are very angry,' Tevez added. 'In the last 20 minutes we lost a game in which we had done very well.

'The team showed great character, but after the goal, when it was 11 against 10, we cannot give away such an important game.'

Juve, aiming for a fourth consecutive title, are nine points clear at the summit with 13 games remaining.
