From road accidents to military attacks, it is thought that a third of people who survive a terrifying experience have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

There is now hope that in the future, a simple pill or nasal spray containing a natural stress-relieving chemical, called neuropeptide Y (NPY), could help survivors recover from stress faster and become less fearful and anxious.

The drug could also be used to make soldiers more resilient in battle situations, experts say.

Scientists from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, are studying the effects of acute stress on the human body at the US army’s ‘survival school’ called Camp Mackall in North Carolina.

There, soldiers are subjected to mock interrogations and other scary situations, Gizmodo reported. 

Professors Dennis Charney and Steven Southwick tested soldiers before and after the mock interrogations and discovered that a chemical called neuropeptide Y (NPY) was produced in the brain when they coped with extreme stress.

Soldiers with higher levels of NPY coped better under pressure. And overall, all of the special forces troops, who are known for working in particularly stressful environments, had more of the chemical than regular soldiers.

The chemical is triggered by stress and helps to repress the release of noradrenaline – a hormone that is involved in the flight-or-fight response.

The scientists think that higher levels of NPY enable people to recover from stress faster and help them be more resilient under pressure.

Animal tests have revealed that doses of the chemical can reduce fear and anxiety, while genetic studies suggest that people with a form of NPY gene are less prone to worrying.

Professor Charney believes that by understanding the role of NPY better, experts could unlock the secret of resilience.

His team has developed an NPY nasal spray to give PTSD patients a low dose of the drug, having gained permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in spring to test it on people.

While he said that a low dose does not appear to produce any noticeable benefits, the team is now giving PTSD sufferers higher doses and hopes to be able to share their its findings by next spring.

The scientists have high hopes because a study on mice in 2013 showed that seven days after the animals were put through a traumatic experience, they were given a high dose of NPY and showed fewer signs of depression and anxiety afterwards than untreated mice.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety caused by very stressful or frightening events.

They may include military combat, terrorist attacks, assault, natural disasters, road accidents or witnessing violent deaths.

PTSD can develop immediately after a disturbing event, or can emerge months or years later.

It's thought that one in three people who have a traumatic experience are affected by PTSD, NHS Choices say.

Sufferers often relive the event through nightmares or flashbacks and can feel isolated, frightened or guilty.

Symptoms, including difficulty sleeping, can be persistent and severe enough to impact on a person's day-to-day life.

PTSD is currently treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) as well as antidepressant medication.
