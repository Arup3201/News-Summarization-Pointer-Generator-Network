A worker tasked with removing the Tower of London poppies bought for £25 each by thousands of well-wishers in support of charity has appeared to brag about stealing one in a Facebook post.

Jo Maxwell claims the post in which she tells a friend she has taken one of the poppies for him was merely a joke.

But Tower chiefs at Historic Royal Palace are said to have sacked the 30-year-old as the first batch of ceramic flowers is dispatched across the country.

Jo Maxell posted a photograph on Facebook holding one of the 888,246 ceramic poppies and told a friend: 'I've got one for you'. The 30-year-old insists her post was a joke 

'Our inquiries are underway,' a spokesman for Historic Royal Parks, who run the popular tourist attraction, told the Sun.  

Ms Maxwell, a ski-worker, insisted she had not stolen one of the 888,246 poppies planted to represent each British soldier who died in WWI. 

Her comments, since removed from Facebook, were slammed by hundreds of people on the social media site. 

One fellow volunteer said even joking about stealing one of the poppies was 'disgraceful'. 

Thousands of people have begun dismantling Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red by artist Paul Cummins after the artwork was visited by around 4million since being unveiled in August. 

Each of the poppies has been bought in advance for £25, with a portion of all sales being donated to Armed Forces charities. 

Unscrupulous internet users attempted to flog their ceramic flowers online before they had even been distributed, with online auctioneers eBay forced to remove listings for the poppies at double their original price.

Thousands of volunteers have begun dismantling the poppies at Tower in London to have them sent to owners across the country. Artist Paul Cummins said thieves had attempted to steal them from vans

A spokesman for the website said: 'We are not permitting resale of the limited edition ‘Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red’ ceramic poppies on eBay.'

Earlier this week Mr Cummins revealed thieves had even attempted to break in to vans preparing to transport the poppies across the country.

'When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them,’ he said. 

'I am not happy.' 

‘It is disrespectful to the people who bought them and made them and to the people they represent.

‘They have been trying to do this ever since we put them in.

‘So many people want them but we are not making any more, because I thought it would be disrespectful to the people who died.'
