Alexis Sanchez has shown that his skills are not limited to the football pitch, as he serenades Arsenal team-mate Lukas Podolski with an impressive piano performance.

The Chilean forward, who joined Arsenal in the summer from Barcelona, performed Richard Marx's 'Right Here Waiting' to Podolski at the Arsenal Christmas party, who then uploaded a video to social media site Instagram.

Dressed in an all-black suit, Sanchez looked as comfortable in front of a piano as he does on the pitch at the Emirates.

Alongside the video, Podolski wrote the message, 'Was great to be serenaded by my bro Alexis! #Christmas #Alexis #Poldi #Bro #multitalented #serenaded'.

The Arsenal squad enjoyed a lavish meal at their second Christmas party, with a number of first-team players posting pictures of their evening online.

The Gunners have had a stuttering start to this season's Premier League campaign, sitting sixth in the Premier League table for Christmas.

They face QPR at the Emirates on Boxing Day, where three points can take them a step closer to the holy grail of a Champions League place.
