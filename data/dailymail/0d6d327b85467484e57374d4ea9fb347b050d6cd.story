Stripped of his honour: James Crosby, the former HBOS Chief Executive, has had his knighthood cancelled after a scathing report into his handling of the financial crisis

Former HBOS chief executive James Crosby has been stripped of his knighthood after a scathing parliamentary report into his handling of the banking crisis.

Mr Crosby asked to have the honour removed after the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards claimed he was the 'architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster' in his handling of the bank.

The decision to cancel his knighthood, bestowed on him back in December 2006, was 
announced in the London Gazette.

The Gazette, the official journal of record, said: 'Letters Patent dated 11 June 2013 have passed the Great Seal of the Realm cancelling and annulling the Knighthood conferred upon James Robert Crosby on the 6 December 2006 as a Knight Bachelor.'

Following the commission's report back in April, Mr Crosby announced he would give up 30 per cent of his £580,000-a-year pension and stood down from roles with catering firm Compass Group and private equity firm Bridgepoint.

He was given a knighthood after leaving HBOS in 2006, but following the report said he believed 'it is right that I should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal'.

Responding to the report in April he said it made for 'very chastening reading'.

He added: 'Although I stood down as CEO of HBOS in 2006, some three years before it was taken over by Lloyds, I have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened.'

He added: 'I am deeply sorry for what happened at HBOS.'

For a knighthood to be withdrawn, the Honours Forfeiture Committee has to make a recommendation to the Prime Minister, who then passes it on to the Queen for a decision.

Honour: Mr Crosby had originally been given a knighthood after leaving HBOS back in 2006

Shamed: Former RBS head Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his involvement in the financial crash last year

Whitehall sources had said earlier this 
year that mandarins would have no choice but to recommend that the Queen
remove honours from bankers in charge during the financial crash.

Whitehall's Forfeiture Committee stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood last year.

It was understood that the Forfeiture Committee would consider the honours of Sir Victor Blank, former chairman of Lloyds bank, who presided over the takeover of HBOS and that of Lord Stevenson, the former HBOS chairman.

The Banking Commission ruled that responsibility for the near-collapse of the bank ‘lies particularly with Lord Stevenson’.

While he cannot be stripped of his peerage by the committee, the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk.

But insiders admit it will be ‘much more difficult’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking.

So far Peter Cummings, head of HBOS corporate banking from 2006 to 2008, is the only man to have been punished over the HBOS scandal.

He was fined £500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the City.
