These pictures show the tragic moment a four-year-old boy was accidentally crushed to death when his parents ran him over while trying to escape the police.

Street vendors Liu Tien, 45, and wife Hsiung, 40, had been selling fruit off the back of their truck in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China's Zhejiang Province when they spotted officers coming towards them and panicked.

Not having a licence to sell, they jumped into the truck forgetting that their son Wu, 4, was playing in front of it and crushed him.

Shop owner Chung Lai, 43, said: 'I heard a commotion in the street and when I looked outside I saw the man and woman on the ground wailing and crying.

'Next to them was the bloody body of their young child. It was a terrible thing to see.

'I don't approve of illegal street vending but with a tragedy like this you can't help but feel for the parents.'

Police rushed to the scene and quickly called an ambulance.

A police spokesman said: 'Sadly, the child died instantly as the vehicle went straight over his head.'

Now social media users have turned on the parents accusing them of negligence.

Writing on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, one person wrote: 'If you let your child run around all over the street every day, then tomorrow won't he get run over by a car?

'This is entirely due to the negligence of the parents.'
