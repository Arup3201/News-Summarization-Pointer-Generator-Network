As jury selection continues in advance of the trial for the alleged perpetrator of the 2012 Colorado theater shooting, public defenders in the case have refused to reveal the cost of James Holmes's defense.

The Office of the State Public Defender, which is defending 27-year-old Holmes because he cannot afford an attorney, has turned away all requests for information on expenses relating to the trial.

The office has cited attorney-client privilege and claimed to be exempt from open-records laws. They also say revealing detailed expenses would give an advantage to state prosecutors.

On trial: As jury selection continues in advance of the trial for the alleged perpetrator of the 2012 Colorado theater shooting, public defenders in the case have refused to reveal the cost of James Holmes's defense

Fox News has estimated the total cost of the trial to be $7million, including $2.9million in federal aid for those injured or affected by the shooting. Part of the money is designated to support their participation in the legal process.

Lead public defenders in the case, Daniel King and Tamara Brady, earn $165,756 a year, while Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler earns $156,000, according to Yahoo News, which estimates the total cost to be $5.5million.

Public defenders are rarely required to release information on a specific trial, though open information laws vary by state, according to Ernie Lewis, executive director for the National Association of Public Defense.

Information on a specific trial's costs are also often hard to separate from the hundreds of cases public defenders try each year, according to Lewis.

A bill by Colorado lawmakers that would have forced the taxpayer-funded Office of the State Public Defender to release information on expenses related to the trial failed in committee Thursday.

'As a steward of taxpayer dollars, I believe we should be able to see how they are spending the money,' State Representative Polly Lawrence Lawrence said. 'I don’t think that is asking too much.'

Insanity defense: Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a movie theater in Aurora

Fox's estimate also includes expenses for the district attorney's office, including more than $775,000 set aside for the Holmes trial not attributed to salaries. 

Public defenders have pointed to the district attorney as the reason the case has been prolonged, as the office is pursuing death penalty charges, refusing to accept a guilty plea with life in prison.

Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a movie theater in Aurora. 

'It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death,' Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said in court.

Fox News, citing the Death Penalty Information Center, reported that studies have 'uniformly and conservatively shown that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.'

Forbes, meanwhile, reports that in California, the annual cost of executing inmates is $137million yearly versus $11.5million for those serving life sentences.

Specific aspects of the case have also added financial strains. $463,000 was spent on additional security measures up until 2014, and $90,000 was spent on closed-circuit television necessary for the victims who could not fit into the 110-person capacity courthouse.

Attorney Steven Zansberg, who has represented the Associated Press and other news outlets, claimed a public right to know that warranted the release of expenses for public defenders.

'The people of this state have a right to know how much tax money is being expended, and how it's being expended,' said Zansberg.

Public Defender Doug Wilson, whose office reportedly has a $83 million operating budget to cover 160,000 cases, told lawmakers the only records requests were 25 from various media outlets, and said they were directed specifically at information on the Holmes trial.
