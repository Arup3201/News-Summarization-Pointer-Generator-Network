Suspect: Jose Alberto Guerra-Orta, 29, was arrested today in connection with the death of Hugo Soria, 33, from Dallas County

The mother of a man suspected of being the driver in a fatal hit-and-run last weekend turned him into police this morning.

Jose Alberto Guerra-Orta, 29, was arrested today in connection with the death of Hugo Soria, 33, from Dallas County.

His body was found on Sunday,  a day-and-a-half after he left his East Dallas home to take a walk and clear his head.

Guerra-Orta will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident/causing death.

His mother turned him in after she recognized the description of the car police were looking for.

His arrest comes one day after Hugo Soria's wife Dara pleaded with the public to find the driver who failed to stop after running over her husband.

'Nothing is going to bring back my husband, nothing.

'But that person needs to be punished for what he did,' Mrs Soria said.

Speaking to NBC she said: 'They called me at eight in the morning, 
and they said, "Do you know Hugo Soria?" And I said, "Yes, is he OK?"

'They said, "We need to come talk to you", and I 
knew right there.

'I was so hysterical. I was like "No, you're not 
coming. Just tell me he's fine".
