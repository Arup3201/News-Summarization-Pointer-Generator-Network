The Metropolitan Police was today accused of withholding information about thousands of crimes unless specifically asked about them by journalists.

Almost half the crimes logged with the force's press bureau were listed as 'if asked', meaning they were only to be disclosed if a reporter heard about them elsewhere and asked for confirmation.

The revelation has raised concerns about transparency, with Labour MP Keith Vaz warning the system could be abused to hide stories that might be embarrassing to Scotland Yard.

Headquarters: Almost half the crimes logged with Scotland Yard's press bureau were logged as 'if asked'

It has come to light after information about a breach of security at Buckingham Palace, regarded as the most embarrassing in three decades, was not released to the media.

After a Freedom of Information request by The Times, Scotland Yard revealed that 4,877 of the 9,906 crimes recorded with its press office in the five months to February were logged 'if asked'.

A spokesman for the force insisted that many were only labelled as such at first, then made available to reporters once more-complete information about them was available.

Many of the logs, the spokesman said, were not appropriate for widespread disclosure as they related to local crime.

The disclosure of the practice comes amid concerns about the transparency of the police and criminal justice system.

Worries: The revelation has raised concerns about transparency, with Labour MP Keith Vaz warning the system could be abused to hide stories that might be embarrassing to Scotland Yard

Dozens of convictions are now believed to be at risk after officers failed to reveal the activities of undercover agents to their courts.

And the secrecy issues do not only affect the Met. Last week there was criticism of the National Crime Agency after it emerged that it had not informed the public of the arrest of a No 10 aide three weeks earlier.

Even after the Press learned of Patrick Rock's arrest over suspected child pornography offences on February 13 the agency, known as Britain's FBI, refused to confirm it had happened.

Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the lack of transparency worried him.

'The sheer number does indicate that there must be important issues buried under the avalanche of cases,' he added.

Scotland Yard's spokesman said it was 'misleading' to suggest that the 'if asked' system meant that information was being withheld from the public.

'In many cases it is simply a record of a response already given to a journalist,' the spokesman said.
