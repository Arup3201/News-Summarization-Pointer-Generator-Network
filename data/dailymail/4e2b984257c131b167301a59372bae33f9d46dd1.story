Team Sky have unveiled the world's biggest cycling jersey ahead of Saturday's Tour de France start.

The replica version of what the likes of Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas will be wearing this weekend is the size of two tennis courts.

The unveiling of the 25m x 25m jersey took place in Millennium Square in Leeds city centre as this year's race will start in Yorkshire.

Froome and Thomas will not be joined by fellow Brit Sir Bradley Wiggins as the 34-year-old has been omitted from Team Sky's plans.

Team Sky general manager Sir Dave Brailsford admitted that he found it difficult to leave Wiggins out but wanted to pick a team that can win the Tour de France.

Froome and Thomas will instead be joined by riders from across the world - including Australian Richie Porte and Mikel Nieve of Spain.
