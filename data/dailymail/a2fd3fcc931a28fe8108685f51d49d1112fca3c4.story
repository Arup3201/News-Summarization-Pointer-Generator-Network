The Beckhams have confirmed they are moving back to London - as David Beckham prepares to announce where he will end his career.

The couple have already enrolled their three sons in a London school and a source told MailOnline : 'It's time for a new London life, they are all very excited.'

They will be leaving Los Angeles after former England captain Becks, 37, played his final game with LA Galaxy last month.

As MailOnline revealed in October, the family have been making plans for the move for some time and Victoria, 38, has been seen house hunting in South-West London.

Homeward bound: The Beckhams have confirmed they are moving back to London.

David - who helped his side win the MLS Cup in December - has been bombarded with options and has offers from Paris Saint-Germain, who are currently top of French Ligue 1, which is reportedly worth £200,000 a week, as well as Monaco.

While Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua have offered Becks £250,000 a week.

He will announce his next move later this month, but a source said:  'David is still undecided, there are the European offers but China is still very strong.'

Wherever Becks decides to go, the family will make their base in London.

After visiting a string of prestigious 
establishments, the Beckhams agreed on a £15,000-a-year school for 
Brooklyn, 13, Romeo, 10, and Cruz, seven.

Svelte Victoria is already believed to have found a nursery for the couple's one-year-old daughter Harper.

The brunette, whose fashion business is going from strength to strength, will be at New York Fashion week next month after the Beckhams spent their first Christmas and New Year together as a family in the Maldives, with a source dismissing reports they had left due to bad weather, saying: 'David and Victoria took the kids on their dream family holiday.

'Usually David is playing football, so this was the first year ever they were able to go away and have a lovely long break, all together.'

In October, a friend said the Beckhams were keen to give their children a British education, saying: ‘David and Victoria love America, they love what it has given them, but the boys loved being back in England and now could be the time to make a return.

‘They have been looking at houses over the past few months and the future is exciting as anything could happen.

‘The thing they are most concerned about is giving the children stability. What is nice about being back in the UK is that they would be close to both their families again.'

The Beckhams moved to Los Angeles in 2007, where Harper was born in July 2011.

When Becks announced his departure from LA Galaxy in November, he insisted: 'Retirement is not something I'm thinking of yet. I still feel I have something left in me. I'd like to take on another challenge but what that will be yet, I don’t know.'

The couple are keeping their $22 million Beverly Hills mansion, which will continue to be their U.S. base, and still own their Hertforshire mansion, nicknamed Beckingham Palace.

In November, a friend said that Victoria and their children would support Beckhs in whatever he chooses to do, adding: 'Victoria and the kids are incredibly supportive of David.

'He is a loving husband and father, but they know that he loves his football.

'There is still one final piece of the jigsaw puzzle left in David's career and wherever he wants to go, his family will be behind him and they will make it work, as they always do.'
