The campaign to save the United Kingdom has increased its lead over Alex Salmond’s push for Scottish independence, a new poll revealed today.

The Survation survey showed 54 per cent of Scots plan to vote No in Thursday’s historic referendum, with 46 per cent backing the nationalists.

It is a dramatic turnaround from a week ago when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, and sent Westminster into panic mode fearing the United Kingdom was days away from separation.

With just six days left before the Scottish independence vote, a new poll has revealed that the No campaign is now in the lead by six percentage points

Men are evenly split over independence, while women are more likely to vote no. The poll also showed 93 per cent of Scots say they will certainly vote in the referendum

Latest data shows highest support for the union among older voters. Numbers also showed that those in the North East of the country were most likely to vote Yes, while those in the South favoured No 

The last week has been dominated by warnings from banks, shops and oil companies about the risks of independence, including rising prices and jobs being relocated to England.

The latest Survation survey, commissioned by the Better Together campaign, suggests it has persuaded more voters to swing behind the Union.

Polling experts said it would be difficult for Mr Salmond to make up the lost ground with only five days left until polling day.

Some 40 per cent of those surveyed say they and their families would be financially worse off if Scotland goes it alone, compared to 27 per cent who believe they would be better off.

Survey also points to a very high turnout with 93 per cent of voters saying they are certain to vote.

Men are split exactly, with 50 per cent support independence and 50 per cent opposed.

Among women, 57 per cent plan to vote no with only 43 per cent in favour.

The breakdown of the poll showed that support for independence is highest among 35-44-year-olds, at 58.5 per cent, and lowest among the over 65s, with just 33 per cent backing the break-up of the UK.

The North East of Scotland is the most pro-independence region of Scotland (54 per cent) with the south most supportive of the Union (30 per cent).

Just 9 per cent of those surveyed say they have yet to make up their minds about which way they will vote.

Professor John Curtice, an expert in political polling, wrote on his blog: ‘Survation continue to fail to find any evidence of a swing to Yes in recent weeks. That will undoubtedly be disappointing for the Yes side.

‘But otherwise this poll clearly confirms the message of many another poll that the referendum race is now tight, albeit one in which the No side still appear to have the edge.

The news will come as a fresh blow to Alex Salmond after businesses warned this week of rising prices and job losses if he secures a Yes vote on September 18

With almost all Tory voters in Scotland vowing to vote No, Labour has deployed former Home Secretary John Reid and Jim Murphy MP to shore up their base

Gordon Brown has also travelled to Scotland this week in order to fight for the No campaign

‘The poll also suggests that gaining further ground could well prove far from easy for the Yes side.’

Blair McDougall, Campaign Director of Better Together, said: ‘This poll suggests that No are in the lead but that the race is far from over.

‘No-one can afford a protest vote. Any one of us could cast the vote that makes the difference between the UK staying together or breaking apart.

‘This week employers and retailers have set out the real economic costs of separation. They have made it clear that jobs will be lost and that prices will rise if there is a yes vote.

‘When we can have better, safer, faster change as part of the UK, why should we risk the costs of separation.’

A Yes Scotland spokesman said: ‘This poll records support for Yes at 46.5 per cent, and an ICM poll conducted around the same time put Yes at 49 per cent. There is everything to play for, and this will spur on everybody who wants and is working hard for a Yes to redouble their efforts.

'As we say in response to all the polls, we are working flat out to ensure that we achieve a Yes vote, because it's the biggest opportunity the people of Scotland will ever have to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy.

'A Yes vote is our one opportunity to achieve job-creating powers, protect our NHS from the damaging impact of Westminster privatisation and cuts, and ensure that never again do we get Tory governments imposed on Scotland that we have roundly rejected.'

The poll will be a bitter blow for Mr Salmond, who was today forced to deny he is plotting a ’day of reckoning’ against businesses opposed to his dream of independence.

The First Minster scrambled to reassure banks, oil companies, supermarkets and retailers after SNP grandee Jim Sillars said an independent Scotland would break up or nationalise pro-Union firms.

With just five days to go until the historic referendum, Mr Salmond has faced a wave of warnings from companies that they will move jobs out of Scotland or put up prices if voters back the breakup of the UK.

Mr Sillars, a former deputy leader of the SNP who appeared campaigning with Mr Salmond last week, lashed out after a host of companies including BP, John Lewis, Asda, Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone RBS, Lloyds and B&Q warned of the dangers of independence.

Retailers ASDA and John Lewis have warned of price rises if Scotland becomes independent, while Standard Life, BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk, Vodafone RBS, Lloyds and B&Q have all warned of dangers

The Royal Bank of Scotland also announced this week that it will move its headquarters to England if Mr Salmond manages to secure independence

More than £17billion in shares in Scottish firms have been dumped by investors in recent weeks and when a poll put the Yes campaign ahead, the pound tumbled to a 10-month low.

Mr Sillars retaliated by saying that oil giant BP would be nationalised 'in part or in whole', while bankers and 'scaremongering' big business chiefs would be punished for 'being in cahoots' with the Tories.

He added: ’This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.’

The incendiary remark threatened to overshadow the last weekend of campaigning ahead of the referendum on Thursday.

The Lib Dems claimed ’intimidation is the tactic of choice’ for the Yes campaign.

In an attempt to quell the deeply damaging row, Mr Salmond today rushed out a statement attempting to reassure businesses they have nothing to fear if Scotland goes it alone.

Mr Salmond said: ’Jim Sillars is a great campaigner who has put aside his personal grief over the loss of his wife Margo MacDonald to put his heart and soul into galvanising the Yes vote.

’He is fighting a fine campaign all over Scotland - but the day after a Yes vote will be a day of celebration for the people, not reckoning for big companies drawn into the No campaign by Downing Street.’

He added that Mr Sillars was ’simply trying to express the anger felt by so many people about the revelations that some supermarket statements were orchestrated by the Prime Minister himself’.

Better Together insiders say the biggest battle is being fought in the west of Scotland, where Labour has launched a massive operation to stop its working class supporters from backing independence.

Senior Tories say almost all of their supporters are committed to vote No and it is down to Labour to secure their base.

Support for the Yes campaign is highest among the 35-44 aged group, while those aged 65+ are most likely to vote against independence

In Glasgow former Labour home secretary John Reid joined Labour MP Jim Murphy for the conclusion of his 100 Meetings in 100 Days tour of Scotland.

Since June Mr Murphy has been travelling across the country and speaking to voters in town centres from atop an IRN-BRU crate to urge a No vote.

Mr Murphy said: ’I've lost most of my voice but I don't think we've lost the argument.

’The nearer it gets, a lot of the undecided voters have looked into the precipice and they've stepped back.’

Mr Reid said: ’The arguments are coming down to two very simple questions.

’Do you want to retain Scotland's history, culture, control over its own affairs within a bigger state that allows us financial stability, economic growth and and the best of both worlds?

’Or do you want to go a separate route with all the dangers, which are now becoming obvious, to pensions, jobs, investment and security?’

As part of the Labour push, former prime minster Gordon Brown used a SPCA at an event in Kirkcaldy to say: ’I yield to no one in my patriotism and my pride in Scotland.

’None of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes no is less patriotic and less proud of our country.

’We are patriotic Scots. We've got a patriotic vision for the future. We're proud of our institutions. We're patriotic, we're proud of Scotland.’
