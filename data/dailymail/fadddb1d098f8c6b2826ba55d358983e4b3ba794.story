Arsenal will have to stretch their growing financial muscle to the limit to sign World Cup winner Sami Khedira.

Following years of frugal transfer dealings, the club are starting to reap the benefits of their long-term financial strategy.

They have already signed Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona in a £30million deal, while the £11million arrival of Mathieu Debuchy should be confirmed this week.

Their next target is a holding midfielder and Khedira, who missed Sunday’s final after suffering an injury in the warm-up, is a strong possibility.

Talks over a move for the Real Madrid star are ongoing, although some members of the Arsenal hierarchy are concerned about the potential cost of the deal.

The fee for the 27-year-old, who has 12 months to run on his Madrid contract, would be in excess of £20million.

In addition, Khedira is understood to want £150,000 per week, a package that would make him Arsenal’s highest paid player.

Manager Arsene Wenger is also interested in Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender, who would be a cheaper option, while Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin is also being considered.

Arsenal will also try to complete the signing of Atletico Madrid right back Javier Manquillo this week and maintain an interest in Southampton youngster Calum Chambers.
