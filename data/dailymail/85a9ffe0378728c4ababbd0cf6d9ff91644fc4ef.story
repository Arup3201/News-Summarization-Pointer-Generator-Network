A Harvard senior and statistics whiz who uses a mathematical model to predict an Oscar nominees chance of winning - and has a 75 percent success rate from previous years - has delivered his forecast for 2015.

Ben Zauzmer - who predicted all eight categories at the 2012 Academy Awards, including Meryl Streep for best actress for The Iron Lady in 2012 - applies information such as Rotten Tomatoes reviews and Golden Globes wins to a formula to determine the chances of an actor or film winning.

And this year's victors?

Zauzmer told The Boston Globe he believes Birdman will take best picture, Eddie Redmayne will win best actor for The Theory of Everything, and Julianne Moore will take best actress for Still Alice.

The most certain of those, Zauzmer contends, is Moore, who has a 84.4 percent chance of winning.

She has been nominated five times but is yet to win.

Redmayne's chances are just as close, with 77.1 percent.

His closest competition was Michael Keaton for Birdman, who registered a 13.8 percent chance of winning.

'The three best predictors for the two top acting categories are the SAGs, the Golden Globes (drama), and the BAFTAs,' Zauzmer told The Boston Globe of his formula.

'Eddie Redmayne won all three for The Theory of Everything. 

'It’s possible that Michael Keaton wins but, make no mistake, that would be a mathematical upset.'

Just a theory: Zauzmer predicts Eddie Redmayne will take best actor for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything

Critically acclaimed: Michael Keaton may be this year's comeback success story, but he will not take the best actor gong, Zauzmer predicts

Birdman has a 39.9 percent chance of taking best picture, with Boyhood sitting behind it on 21.8 percent.

Zauzmer says all indications say this a 'two-horse race' and that the competition - The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, American Sniper, Whiplash, The Theory of Everything and Selma - stand little chance.

Birdman also has a 55.6 percent of winning best director for Alejandro Inarritu.

However the critics favorite in that category is Richard Linklater for Boyhood. 

When it comes to best supporting actor, Zauzmer says J.K Simmons is a shoe-in for Whiplash, with 84.7 percent.

Shoe-ins: Both J.K. Simmons, for Whiplash, and Patricia Arquette, for Boyhood, will will best supporting actor and actress respectively, Zauzmer said. They are seen here winning the categories at the BAFTA awards

'(Simmons) will run away with the Oscar,' Zauzmer predicts.

Similarly, Patricia Arquette is expected to win best supporting actress for Boyhood, with 82.2 percent.

Birdman is predicted to win best original screenplay (44.3 percent), while The Imitation Game should win best adapted screenplay (66.3 percent).

How To Train Your Dragon 2 is the odds-on favorite for best animated feature, with 45.6 percent.

While Interstellar is the favorite for best visual effects, with 50.5 percent, Birdman trumped the predictions for best cinematography with 38.6 percent. 

Citizenfour, the gripping inside look at the Edward Snowden whistle-blower saga, is expected to win best documentary, with 42.4 percent. 

The Grand Budapest Hotel is expected to take best production design, best costume design, and best hair and makeup.
