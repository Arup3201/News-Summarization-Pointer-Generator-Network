Police in northern Wyoming say a rifle discharged after a dog apparently stepped on it, injuring a 46-year-old man.

Johnson County Sheriff Steve Kozisek says the bullet struck Richard L. Fipps, of Sheridan, in the arm on Monday.

The injury is not life-threatening but Fipps is being treated in a hospital in Billings, Montana.

Prevention:Sheriff Steve Kozisek said that the shooting could have been prevented had the gun not been loaded

Kozisek told The Sheridan Press  that Fipps and two others were in a remote area trying to move a vehicle that had become stuck. Fipps was standing beside his truck when he told his dog to move from the front seat to the back seat. 

The sheriff says a rifle was on the back seat and it discharged toward Fipps.

'The rifle was loaded and in the bed of the truck [with some other gear], and the dog hopped up there and either stepped on it or caused something to move and set it off,' Kozisek told the Huffington Post.

Kozisek said that the shooting could have been prevented had the gun not been loaded.

A similar incident occurred a year ago in Florida when a man was accidentally shot by his dog while driving in his truck.
