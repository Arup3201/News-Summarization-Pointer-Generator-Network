International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced Britain is to almost treble to £1.8 billion a year the amount of foreign aid devoted to boosting emerging economies

Someof the biggest names on the High Street are to be handed British aid money to improve conditions for their foreign suppliers.

Retail giants such as Tesco, Asda and Marks & Spencer will be  eligible for grants to help improve the lives of the Third World farmers and manufacturers who supply their stores.

But critics questioned why some of Britain’s most successful and highly profitable firms are being given taxpayers’ cash for projects they could easily fund themselves.

Schemes include cash for budget clothing chain Primark to improve conditions in Bangladesh’s notorious sweatshops. Primark – along with Debenhams and Asda – will be funded to run an initiative to ‘improve the management of garment factories’.

And John Lewis, River Island and Morrisons will receive cash for a scheme to help Bangladeshi factories ‘rapidly meet labour and safety standards’.

The initiatives follow the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex in Bangladesh last year, which claimed more than 1,100 lives. More than 40 Western retailers, including Primark, are thought to have sourced clothing from the giant plant.

The controversial projects come amid mounting criticism that Britain’s overseas aid programme – which is set to hit more than £12billion this year – is already unjustifiable at a time of domestic spending cuts.

The amount the UK government hands out is due to rise from £8billion in order to hit a target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, but critics believe it is too high while spending on schools and hospitals is being squeezed at home.

In a speech at the London Stock Exchange yesterday, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the move was part of a wider push to focus more of the aid budget on economic development.

This would boost long-term trade, from which Britain could benefit, she said.

But Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘It is quite extraordinary, and quite wrong, to be subsidising big companies in this way.

‘I think ordinary taxpayers will be very surprised indeed to find they are subsidising the likes of Tesco and Asda to improve conditions for their suppliers.

‘These companies should be improving their supply chains because it’s the right thing to do, not because they are going to get a Government grant to do it.

‘It’s another example of the problems you get when you set an arbitrary target for spending money on aid – you end up spending it for the sake of it.’

Robert Oxley, campaign director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, described the scheme as a ‘totally inappropriate’ use of public money.

He said the initiative was a form of 
‘corporate welfare’, with taxpayers’ cash being used to help salve the 
consciences of corporations that are sometimes accused of exploiting 
suppliers in the developing world.

Mr Oxley said: ‘The aid budget is meant to help the world’s poorest, not provide corporate welfare across the globe.’

Miss Greening said a number of leading firms had already signed up to the £4million Trade in Global Value Chains Initiative.

Asda,
 a subsidiary of the American retail giant Walmart, the world’s second 
biggest public corporation, has already put forward two proposals.

Marks
 & Spencer will receive money for a project to develop the 
‘leadership and management skills’ of farm workers in Kenya and South 
Africa.

Another initiative will see Sainsbury’s establish an ‘innovative radio show’ for farmers in Kenya.Tesco
 and Asda will be given grants to help pay for the training of ‘young 
fruit farm workers from disadvantaged backgrounds in South Africa’.

The
 firms are eligible for grants of up to £750,000 each to help pay for 
projects. In return they have to provide a similar amount of their own 
money.

A source at the 
Department for International Development (Dfid) last night said the 
scheme would help 700,000 workers in the developing world and insisted 
the department was not subsidising wealthy corporations.

‘None
 of this money is invested in the companies themselves,’ the source 
said. ‘Instead, it is invested in development projects that would not 
otherwise get off the ground.’

Critics claim Dfid has a patchy record on boosting economic development.

Last
 month Miss Greening was forced to close the £100million Trademark 
Southern Africa initiative following a damning report that found senior 
staff were receiving ‘lavish’ six-figure salaries, with at least one 
paid more than David Cameron.
