Your party shoes are primed or drinking boots are ready to be filled, but in a new city how will you know where to go? It's a most common travel predicament that a London party planner is keen to solve once and for all.

Whether it's New York, Rome or London, there's a genuine risk in a strange city of  spending the night wandering aimlessly into all the wrong places or, worse still, being herded into the tackiest of tourist 'hot spots'. 

London businessman Richard Walker-Smith has  launched Zoola Fix, a website connecting visitors to cities with their 'Fixers' across 14 countries, for this very reason. It's already proving a hit with revellers, he says, and an app is set to launch this year.

The Fixers, local movers and shakers, take a fee from groups keen to be squired around the city by those in the know, to hand-picked clubs, bars, restaurants and more.

Party tour guides, if you will, the Fixers will spend as little or as much time with their clients as requested. 

Their skill set includes securing passage through the most intimidating club security cordons or simply picking out and booking the best table in town - especially handy if you don't speak the long language.

'Fixers' such as Zarah, an Austrian artist based in London, apply to go on Zoola Fix's books and potential clients chose their host based on their advertised interests. Zarah's specialty is trap, grime and hip-hop

Walker-Smith, 27, is also one of the Fixers, and so far the only one on the Zoola Fix website to have received a user rating - both of them the maximum five stars from groups who rave about his bespoke evenings to the weirdest and most wonderful clubs London has to offer.

His company, since launching in December, has spread quickly around some of the world's most popular party destinations. 

He opened up applications for Fixers from nations beyond the initial US and UK, which has numerous fixers covering London and Manchester on January 8. 

The Fixers will help tourists get in to the most exclusive clubs in each city, such as Boujis in London

The list of cities is growing daily and extends to Sydney, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Antwerp, with Milan and Rome in Italy also covered.

'Our Fixers have had bookings from the US, Russia, Lebanon, Dubai, Italy, Colombia, Israel, Greece, Turkey, France, UK and more,' says Walker-Smith.

'So far London has been by far our most in-demand city for bookings, with New York seeing the highest number of Fixer applications.

'We now have Fixers in 14 cities and this number is increasing daily. We only opened the platform to countries outside of the UK this month so growth has been fast.' 

The site, set out almost like a dating page but for party-goers, has profiles for each of the Fixers whose credentials for facilitating a terrific night out in their respective city have been assessed before they made the grade.

Potential clients and the Fixers communicate via a secure messaging service before they are on the same page and are comfortable enough to exchange numbers. 

From there, high-end evenings in the most exclusive New York clubs or a fun night of karaoke and dive bars can await.

From their profiles, Zoola Fix's masters of the night are essentially keen to show clients a good time. Some are local club promoters while others simply like to show off their cities best attributes. 

Fixers tend to be from those who aren’t constrained by a 9–5 job, so we have a lot of creative types such as artists, actors, musicians, models and people in the fashion industry, or from those already working in the nightlife or hospitality industry,' Walker-Smith says.

'Guests so far have been a mix of both leisure and business travellers but it’s also occasionally being used by existing residents of a city. Most have been in their late 20s and 30’s but we’ve had interest and bookings from groups in their 40s, 50s and even 60s!' 

Other cities on the books include Miami in the States, Sydney in Australia, Antwerp in Belgium, Vancouver in Canada, Copenhagen in Denmark, Hamburg in Germany, Milan and Rome in Italy and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

Fashionista Julia takes her guests beyond the sights found in Hamburg brochures for 350 euros

Milan's Filippo works for a local party planning website while New York's Danna assists a high-end crowd

The exclusive clubs, bars and restaurants of New York are accessible via a range of New York experts

New York-based Danna, 37, charges a hefty $350 for her Zoola services. She specialises in the high-end of the market and claims to 'know everyone and their mother in NYC.'

Vancouver local Taylor, 25, is entrenched in the cosmopolitan Canadian city's electronic music scene but also knows her way around its extensive network of craft breweries and cocktail bars.

In San Francisco, 33-year-old Ben charges just $95 and is happy to help his guests have a big night out of dancing, an impromptu dive bar crawl or sing their hearts out at a  karaoke club.

If Bondi Beach and beats is your thing and you happen to be in Sydney, Sarah can lead you in the right direction while club promoter Mathias, Zoola's only Antwerp Fixer so far, guarantees that if there's a VIP section his clients will get access after his initial fee of 150 euros.

The catch is that the price includes only the Fixers' services, their tailoring a night to the client's needs, and not additional drinks, cover charges (unless the fixer knows a loophole) and transport. However the Fixer can line up for your drinks and order you a taxi.

London, the city in which Zoola was launched in December last year, is by far its most popular location

The be connected with a 'Fixer', users simply go to the website, select their city of choice and scroll through their ever-growing database.  

Fixers, should they be willing and able to meet the clients' requests, are obliged to accompany their guests for six hours but can stay for less or more time if mutually agreed.

Walker-Smith says his company offers authentic tastes of nightlife in the world's most happening cities without needing to resort to a package club or organised bar crawl.

Zoola Fix is an extension of Walker-Smith's company Zoola Live, his introduction into the nightlife scene with which he organised a series of underground parties.

The entrepreneur also claims to have introduced fish pedicures to the UK after discovering them at a Cambodian night market and opened the short-lived Zoola Bowl cereal restaurant.
