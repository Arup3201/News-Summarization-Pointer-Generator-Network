South Korean scientists have created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs, bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures or scan a step closer to reality.

Researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology combined graphene with silver nanowires to form a thin, transparent electrode capable of stretching, which overcome the weaknesses of each individual material.

The newly invented electrodes have widespread possibilities, including taking pictures with soft contact lenses.

Last year, South Korean scientists created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs, bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures a step closer to reality

Fact or fiction: Contacts capable of scanning data no longer exist only in movies such as Mission Impossible 4

'We believe the hybridization between two-dimensional and 
one-dimensional nano materials presents a promising strategy toward 
flexible, wearable electronics and implantable bio sensor device,' Jang-Ung Park, 
professor of the School of Nano-Bioscience and Chemical Engineering at Ulsan, told Science Daily.

High-tech eye wear such as Google Glasses and augmented reality contact lenses are nothing new, but the South Korean scientists are the first to be able to create a flexible, transparent material that can be used in soft contact lenses.

Microsoft and the University of Washington have been working on similar projects, that seem more like a prop in movies such as Mission Impossible 4.

In January last year, they created a prototype of a hard augmented reality contact lens capable of receiving radio signals and transmitting them to the brain through optical nerves, according to Desktop Engineering.

Transparent electrodes are more commonly used in touch screen computers, flat-screen TV and light-emitting devices.

However, the material used to make them, indium tin oxide, is brittle and expensive because of its limited availability.

The alternative was networks of randomly distributed mNW electrodes, which are cheap but not as stable. Graphene and silver nanowires are also limited by their capabilities.

The new hybrid material however, has a high electrical and optical performance with mechanical flexibility and can be stretched for flexible electronics.

Scientists discovered little change in its resistance when bent or folded. The hybrid transparent electrode has a low "sheet resistance" and high transmittance. It was also able to preserve its electrical and optical properties against thermal oxidation condition.

To demonstrate its possibilities, researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology created a soft contact lens with LEDs.

A rabbit made to wear the lens for five hours showed no irritation or health problems, such as having a blood shot eye or trying to rub the area.
