One in five Australians are close to broke after paying bills from their pay cheque

One in five Australians are close to broke after paying bills from their pay cheque. 

This is forcing three quarters of Australians who are struggling  to enter into savings to pay for unexpected expenses. 

New polling reveals one in six pawn their possessions, while two in five resort to their credit card to help afford extra costs. These typically are medical and dental expenses or more expensive household bills or car repairs.  

The results have prompted a campaign aimed at assisting people in financial stress and helping them avoid money struggles  till pay-day and subsequently becoming pay-day lenders, news.com.au reports.

Young people have been found most likely to be victims of pay-day lending and then end up  facing high interest rates as high as 160 per cent.  

Only one in 200 people aged 50 and over have admitted to using a pay-day lender, while one in 20 people aged 18 to 24 turn to a lender in times of financial stress. Money struggles is also higher in country people, compared to city slickers.

NAB, who conducted the polling, will be working with Good Shepherd Microfinance on the campaign in attempt to sweep out quick fixes and find a longer solution to help financial stress. 

'People who find themselves in difficult financial situations often seek quick fixes such as selling their possessions or getting a high cost pay-day loan,' said Adam Mooney, chief executive of Good Sheperd Microfinance. 

'While satisfying the immediate need, these solutions can lead to bigger problems down the track.' 

He said illness and divorce are the two biggest triggers for financial worries.  

But new NAB boss Andrew Thorburn believes his bank does not close doors on those in financial troubles. 

'As Australians, we pride ourselves on giving people a fair go and at NAB we think that includes having access to fair and affordable finance when you need it,' Mr Thorburn said.
