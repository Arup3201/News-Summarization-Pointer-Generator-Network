A drug addict who mugged frail pensioner Alan Barnes wept today as he heard lawyers will argue his attack was a 'hate crime'.

Prosecutors say Richard Gatiss deliberately targeted his 4ft 6in, visually-impaired 67-year-old victim out of hostility towards the disabled.

The cowardly attack on Mr Barnes, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, shocked Britain in January and a fundraising campaign to buy him a new home made £330,000 in just a few days.

Gatiss, 25, also of Gateshead, appeared briefly at Newcastle Crown Court via a videolink from Durham Prison today, where he is being kept in segregation for his own safety. He will be sentenced on April 2.

The mugger sat hunched in his chair today as he followed proceedings and broke down in tears at one point.

Nick Dry, prosecuting, said Gatiss struck in an area of sheltered accommodation for disabled and elderly people. He also made a partial admission to police that he knew of Mr Barnes prior to the attack.

The court heard that, in Mr Barnes's opinion, he was attacked due to his disability.

Mr Dry said if it was agreed that Gatiss specifically targeted Mr Barnes 'it can be inferred there is a general hostility towards people of disability'.

That could mean Gatiss was guilty of a disability hate crime, which would aggravate the assault with intent to rob charge that he admitted last month.

Mr Dry added: 'It is pure inference that is sought by the crown.'

The attack on Mr Barnes sparked outrage around Britain and led to his neighbour, beautician Katie Cutler, organising a fund to help the 67-year-old

Donations flooded in from around the world and saw Mr Barnes given £330,000 to buy him a new home

But Judge Paul Sloan QC suggested the claim of a general hostility towards disabled people was 'hollow' and told the court the aggravating circumstances would be factored into the sentencing anyway.

He said the prosecution must serve evidence to back up their claims within a week.

Judge Sloan told Gatiss at the end of the 10-minute hearing he would continue to be remanded in custody and 'an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable'.

It has previously been said in court that Gatiss was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he mugged Mr Barnes.

His victim was shoved over and broke his collar bone but Gatiss fled empty-handed when Mr Barnes called for help.
