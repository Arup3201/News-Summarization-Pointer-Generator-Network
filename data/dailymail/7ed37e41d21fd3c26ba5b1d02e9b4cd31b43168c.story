A mother has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her young sons with eye drops and now faces charges of assault and endangering the welfare of children.

State police in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania confirmed on Monday that they had arrested Samantha Elizabeth Unger after she told them she put visine drops into the drink of her three year-old.

She added that her one-year-old got sick by drinking them accidentally.

The 23-year-old told officers that she put the medication in his water and juice, eventually giving him more than a bottle of the eye drops, according to her arrest affidavit.

Both children became sick earlier this year, with the older boy requiring several visits to hospital.

At one point he was airlifted to hospital by the emergency services because his pulse had become dangerously low.

Doctors at the Hershey Medical Center in Pennsylvania suspected the child had been poisoned and tests found the substance in the three-year-old's urine.

Ms Unger lived in Orrtanna, outside Gettysburg at the time but has since moved across the state line to Thurmont, Maryland.

Her public defender did not return a phone message left on Tuesday.

A judge set bail at $50,000 two weeks ago and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for later this month.

Adams County District Attorney Shawn Wagner said Ms Unger was not charged with attempted murder because that requires an element of intent.

Mr Wagner explained: 'We could not show that intent, given her actions in this case.'
