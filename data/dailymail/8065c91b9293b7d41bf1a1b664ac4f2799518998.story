A Kentucky family has accused the director of a local funeral home with holding their dead baby's remains hostage because they haven't paid their bill.

Brittany Jones baby was delivered stillborn baby  and she attempted to collect the baby boy's body from the Lamb Funeral Home.

Mrs Jones says the owner, Dorris Lamb, who is also the coroner in Christian County, refused to release her son's body unless her family paid for it to be transported.

Upset: Brittany Jones is accusing a funeral director of taking advantage of her and her family them after the death of her baby

Owner: Dorris Lamb, the owner of Lamb Funeral Home says he has never held a family to ransom but said that they would have to wait a day to have the baby's remains

'I never thought someone would hold our baby just for money, and we just wanted to bury him and try to move on,' Mrs Jones told WSMV.

Jones and her husband couldn't afford to bury their son at the Lamb, so decided bring his remains to Todd County Funeral Home because the owner there, Shane Hessey, offered to handle the funeral services for free.

Rescuers: The Todd County Funeral Home eventually came to the Jonses aid to assist and buried the baby for free

Rough: The Jonses said they were left devastated by the treatment they received and ended up calling 911

Good man: Shane Hessey from the Todd County Funeral Home owner Shane Hessey went to the Lamb home to pick the body up but was refused because there was a balance owed on transportation costs

Dispatcher: '911, where is your emergency?'

Mother: 'I need a sheriff dispatched to Lamb Funeral Home.'

Dispatcher: 'What's going on at Lamb's?'

Mother: 'They have my baby and won't release him.

Dispatcher: 'Who has your baby and won't release it?'

Mother: 'Lamb Funeral Home. He cussed out the funeral director. We talked with him to get a price earlier - what it would cost to bury our baby, a little baby, and he won't release him to Todd County where we want him buried.'

Dispatcher: 'Why are they refusing to release the child?'

Mother: 'He said that I owe him money, but he hasn't done any, provided any service. He hasn't planned the funeral. He wouldn't do anything until we come up with the money.'

'We went to pick the body up, and he refused to give us the body because there was a balance owed on his transportation costs,' Mr Hessey said. 'We waited until the next day before we got the remains.'

The family claim time was running out to embalm their son so they could have an open casket funeral

Things got so tense, the Joneses ended up calling called 911 for police assistance in the matter.

Mrs Jones called to say that the Lamb funeral home were refusing to release their baby until they came up with some cash  despite no service having been provided.

Mr Lamb denied that he refused to release the body to the distraught parents.

'When babies' families or adults are distraught, sometimes they hear things or think things that aren't necessarily true. This talking about monies, there was no monies involved at all on our behalf,' he insisted.

'There was no charge here. For a ransom you have to have a demand. All we did is tell them they would need to come the next day.'

Lamb says the family was upset because they wanted him to release the remains sooner than he did.

The Kentucky Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors has investigated Lamb in the past, and another family has brought similar claims against the funeral home.

Distraught: The Joneses wanted one last chance to see their baby and say their goodbyes. They claim time was running out to embalm their son so they could have an open casket funeral. That's why they called 911, asking the police to intervene

Denial: Mr Lamb denies the Joneses' claims, saying he agreed to release the baby's remains the day after the family requested it, and he says he didn't demand money
