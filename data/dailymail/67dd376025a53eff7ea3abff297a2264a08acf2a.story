Border officials have found an £8million haul of liquid cocaine hidden in tins of carrot juice at Gatwick Airport.

The UK Border Agency believes it is the biggest seizure of its kind in British history.

Staff made the discovery while carrying out checks on a cargo flight which had arrived from Jamaica on Monday, January 14.

Border Agency officers found the huge liquid cocaine haul after carrying out checks on a food shipment which arrived at Gatwick Airport from Jamaica

The shipment was labelled as foodstuffs but officials found the cocaine hidden in tins marked as containing carrot juice.

The drugs weighed around 80kilos and would have been worth around £8million once cut and sold on the street.

During an investigation led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the shipment was tracked to a number of addresses across London before arriving at premises in Beckenham, south London two days later.

Officers carried out raids on a number of properties and said they found evidence of previous shipments as well as large quantities of cash.

William Hayles, 50, and Randall St Patrick Lewis, 52, have been charged with conspiracy to import controlled drugs, and were remanded in custody until April 26, when they will appear at the Old Bailey, London.

Three people were bailed pending further inquiries.

Border Force South Director, Carole Upshall, said: 'This was a major seizure and it demonstrates how Border Force officers are on constant alert to keep illegal drugs and other banned substances out of the UK.

'Working closely with our law enforcement colleagues at Soca we have managed to thwart this smuggling attempt and stop a sizeable amount of cocaine making it on to the streets of Britain.

'Drug trafficking is a serious offence and those convicted face long prison sentences.'

The Serious Organised Crime Agency tracked the shipment from Gatwick Airport to several addresses in south London where they arrested five people on suspicion of drug trafficking offences

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
