Dougie Freedman looks set to stay as Bolton manager despite the club's woeful start to the season.

The Scot looked to be on borrowed time following the abject 4-0 defeat at Fulham and it was thought he would be sacked by Wanderers on Thursday.

However, the club confirmed Freedman would be at the pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of the home clash with Bournemouth.

The Championship table

Bolton chairman Phil Gartside has been loyal to Freedman, who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints.

Results and recent performances had put pressure on Bolton to make a change before they get cut adrift by the teams above them but it seems as if this has been resisted. 

There were financial considerations to any sacking and it has been suggested that Wanderers could not afford to get rid of Freedman, whose contract runs out at the end of the season.

Bolton have won just once in the Championship this season and are second from bottom with only Blackpool - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them.

The players do not seem to be playing for Freedman and the manager, who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side, chops and changes frequently - there were five against Fulham. This has led to some horrendous performances, home and away.

The fans have lost patience with him, too, as the vocal minority have become the majority. There were pitch invasions against Derby on Saturday and chants for the manager to go at Craven Cottage.

Freedman's apparent inability to acknowledge that his actions play a part in the current struggle has infuriated supporters but even after a display as rancid as the one at Fulham, he still insisted he was the right man for the job and that there was a 'good spirit' among the players. 

He told the Bolton News: 'I’m here to work, I’m here to do my very best and that’s what I’m doing right now.

'I don’t think that way at all (about being sacked). I’m working very hard to turn this round.

'I don’t think the players have chucked the towel in, I think they have shown a very good spirit. They have shown a good spirit and kept on going.' 

It looks as if he will get another chance against Bournemouth at the weekend.
