A man and his teenage son were shot dead in their photography store in broad daylight.

Paul Petras and his son Andrew, known as AJ, were killed on Saturday afternoon after holding a photography class.

Mr Petras, 56, employed his 19-year-old son AJ at May’s Community Photography in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

According to family friends AJ, who 
graduated from the local La Crosse Aquinas High School last year, had 
announced his plans to take over the store, much to his father’s 
delight.

‘You could see 
pride in Paul’s face,’ Diana Hundt told the La Crosse Tribunal from 
outside the Petras’ home on nearby French Island.

‘Paul
was just a good, decent man, and A.J. had turned into a kind, gentle, 
wonderful young man who was going to take over the business.’

Local police believe the shootings took place at some point between 2pm and 5.15pm on Saturday, but they have released no other details into the case as they are still calling for help from the public.

The large window for the possible timing of the crimes shows that police are still trying to pinpoint key facts about the murders.

Unusual: Police say that AJ and his father were shot sometime between 2pm and 5pm but normally the pair left the store promptly at 2pm on Saturdays

Steve Rose, who owns Rose Jewelers next door to the Petras' film store, said that it was highly unusual for either Paul or AJ to still be in the store on Saturday afternoons because May's closes at 2pm.

Mr Rose told the local paper The Winona Daily News that his son may have been one of the last people to see AJ alive when the boy went into May's to get a soda and he was waited on by AJ. At the time, everything seemed fine.

'We closed at 3,' Mr Rose told the paper.

'My son left at 3.05 and I left at 3.15. My son said he remarked to himself that it was peculiar that Paul's car was still there. Usually, they were out at 2- boom.'

Erin
Almquist, bar manager at Fat Sam's Main Street Bistro across the street
from the store, said a man and his daughter were eating at one of the 
bistro's three sidewalk tables about 5pm when they saw someone run out 
of the camera shop screaming for somebody to call 911.

‘The man came in and asked to use the phone and called 911,’ Almquist said.

‘Within two minutes, the street was filled with fire trucks and cop cars,’ she said.

On
Saturday night AJ Petras’ Facebook page began filling up with tributes 
to the young man one of his friend’s called ‘the nicest kid I ever met’.

No arrests: Investigators deep in conversation at the scene whilst the street in downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin remained closed on Sunday

One female friend wrote: ‘The times we shared together I'll never forget. I'll miss you like crazy.

'Summer
isn't going to be the same without seeing you every day. You were truly
an amazing friend and would've done anything for any one of them.’

AJ was a keen snowboarder and member of his high school ski team and one friend posted a commemorative photo of the 19-year-old with his arms full of snowboard jackets.

The caption read: ‘Taking down other people's coats in the freezing cold at state; ultimate act of selflessness. Especially because I know those are girls coats. True gentleman. I'll join you on the slopes on the other side eventually. Miss you homie.’

La Crosse police are appealing for witnesses to the incident or suspicious behaviour in the area on Saturday afternoon.

Captain Robert Lawrence, La Crosse Police said:  ‘Somebody running away or driving away fast - even if it seems insignificant.’

Murders are a rarity in La Crosse, and the deaths of the Petras pair bring the city's murder count up to four this year. No arrests have been made.
