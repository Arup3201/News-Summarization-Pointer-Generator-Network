The Duchess of Cambridge normally dominates the Royal style stakes, but it was the Queen who today stole the show with some vintage glamour in a luxurious fur coat.

Queen Elizabeth II arrived for the royals' traditional Christmas church service at a chapel on the Sandringham Estate in the brown fur coat which she has owned since 1961.

Paired with some simple black shoes and pearl earrings, the look was reminiscent of the Hollywood glamour typically associated with starlets in the 1950s.

The Queen would have been perfectly warm in the thick coat, as while parts of the country were covered in snow or flood water, the weather in Sandringham, Norfolk, was mild and sunny.

She was joined for the service at St. Mary Magdelene Church by the rest of the royal family, including her pregnant granddaughter Zara Phillips, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.Â 

But the Queen didn't stay in the coat for long, making her first outfit change of the day into a vibrant burnt orange cashmere Stewart Parvin coat.

Sticking with her glamourous theme, the Queen made the outfit even more dramatic by adding a black fur hat to match the fur ruffs on her coat.

She kept on her classic pearl earrings with a matching necklace but added a diamond brooch in the shape of a bow to complete the ensemble.

On average, the Queen is said to make at least five clothes changes on Christmas Day - choosing a new outfit for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, and something to wear for shooting or horseback riding.

As well as these changes on the day, the Queen also reveals a carefully-chosen outfit in her annual pre-recorded Christmas Day speech which is aired every year on December 25th at 3pm.

But this year she opted to recycle one of her favourite outfits - a yellow dress by designer Angela Kelly which she wore to the wedding of her grandson William to Kate Middletonin March 2011.

She again wore a brooch on her left shoulder but picked a different one for this occasion. Rather than plain diamonds, she opted for a flower bouquet containing diamonds, rubies and sapphires.

The brooch was a present from her parents to celebrate the birth of Charles in 1948, which she wore at George's christening.

During her speech, the queen paid tribute to family and milestones but also urged people to reflect on the last 12 months.

She said: 'With so many distractions, it is easy to forget to pause and take stock.'

Seated at a table decorated with pictures of her immediate family, the 87-year-old monarch touched on prominent events over the past year - from the service that marked the 60th anniversary of her coronation to the birth of George.

The birth of a baby 'gives everyone the chance to contemplate the future with renewed happiness and hope,' she said.

The queen's message - the latest in a royal tradition that began with a radio address by King George V in 1932 - also contemplated the role of the Commonwealth and looked ahead to the Commonwealth Games being held in Glasgow next year.

The queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957. She writes the messages herself and the broadcasts mark a rare occasion on which the queen voices her own opinion without government consultation.
