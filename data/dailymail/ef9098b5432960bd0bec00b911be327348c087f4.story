Thomas Morris who was strangled by his own karate belt in a freak accident while carrying out a martial arts exercise

A teenage fitness fanatic accidentally strangled himself with a karate belt after trying out a martial arts exercise he had seen on the internet, an inquest has heard. 

Thomas Morris, 17, was found dead in his home gym in Morriston, Swansea, with the belt around his neck - after trying to copy the training exercise.

An inquest heard the karate fan had viewed the online training video of martial arts experts using their belt under their chin.

The coroner heard that Thomas, who was also a talented rugby player, had shown his sisters the exercise which he hoped would build up his fitness. 

His mother Belinda and his cousins went to look for Thomas in the gym in an outbuilding in the garden when she returned from an afternoon out, and found him along with the belt wrapped around his neck.

Detective Sergeant Lee Carpenter said: 'They went outside where he would train in the gym. They found him suspended.'

Mrs Morris said Thomas was keen on martial arts and had recently been on a trip to the Himalayas with his father.

She added: 'He'd been doing different exercises for months and months.'

His sisters Catherine and Sarah told police that one of the exercises they believed he had been doing that day, involved something Thomas had seen in a video online.

A coroner heard that Thomas, who was also a talented rugby player, had shown his sisters the exercise to build up fitness. But he died after his belt became wrapped around his neck while he  was home alone training in the outside gym

Catherine said: 'He had shown us and he could have been trying it himself.'

Swansea Coroner Clive Phillips ruled out suicide and concluded his death was misadventure.

Mr Phillips said: 'There was nothing to suspect anything was seriously troubling him.

'We've heard from the family that he might have been carrying out this martial arts technique and death was unintended.'
