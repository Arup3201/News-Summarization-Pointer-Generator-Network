Three British soldiers were killed by a massive bomb in Afghanistan that the Taliban spent three weeks planting below a road, it emerged today.

Terrorists dug a tunnel under a key route through Helmand Province and then pulled a wire to detonate the 450lb weapon with devastating results as an Army vehicle passed over it last April.

The bomb killed Corporal William Savage, 30, Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, the first troops to die travelling in the Army’s heavily-armoured 23-ton Mastiff vehicles.

Six other soldiers were injured by the Taliban attack.

Victims: Corporal William Thomas Savage, left, and Fusiler Samuel Flint right, both served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (2 Scots), and were killed by a 450lb bomb in April

Mastiff personnel carriers had 
withstood hundreds of attacks since they were brought in specifically to
combat the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2007.

Tragedy: The Taliban also took the life of Private Robert Murray Hetherington, from the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (7 Scots)

Military sources said at the time that the blast did not appear to have penetrated the £1million Mastiff’s armour.

Instead, the casualties were 
apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force 
of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof.

'It's an arms race, they build bigger bombs, we build better vehicles and so on. Bit there can always be a bigger bomb,' a military source told The Sun today.

Cpl Savage – nicknamed Sav – who 
was born in Irvine, Scotland, was described as a ‘shining example of a 
soldier and a rising star’. His wife Lyndsey said: ‘I am completely devastated but extremely proud of 
Sav. I have lost the love of my life.’

Fusilier Flint, from Blackpool, was 
described as a ‘vastly impressive soldier’. His family said they were 
‘completely devastated’.

Pte Hetherington had represented 
Scotland at lacrosse and was said to have ‘epitomised everything that is
excellent about the reserve forces’.

The men and their six comrades were on
a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when 
they were attacked. Their deaths took the number of British soldiers 
killed in Afghanistan to 444.

At the time David Cameron confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used to cope with such attacks.

He said: ‘We have done an enormous 
amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that 
our soldiers use out in Afghanistan and, as I understand, it had a 
pretty good record of withstanding blasts from IEDs.

'I’m sure we’ll want
to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make 
sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment 
they have.

‘The troops have said to me they were 
pretty satisfied with what they had, but we must always look at this.’

The Prime Minister added that the UK had paid a ‘very high price’ for 
the work to stabilise Afghanistan.

General Lord Dannatt, the former head 
of the Army, said: ‘The Taliban have found a way of countering the 
protective qualities of the Mastiff. It would seem that this was an 
extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause 
fatalities within the vehicle itself.’

The attack came three days after the 
Taliban launched its ‘spring offensive’ against coalition forces. The 
Taliban said they would infiltrate ‘enemy ranks’ to conduct ‘insider 
attacks’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers.

The IED, which may have been dug into 
the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter, could have 
been detonated remotely. The Mastiff carries electronic counter-measures
to jam remote-controlled IEDs, and investigators will check for links 
between the massive blast and Iran which is suspected of providing the 
Taliban with bomb training as well as equipment and techniques to avoid 
jamming devices.
