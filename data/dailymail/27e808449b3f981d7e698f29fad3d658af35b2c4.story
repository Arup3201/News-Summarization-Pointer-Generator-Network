A New York property developer whose burned body was found in a dumpster may have been stalked by his attackers for up to two weeks before his kidnap.

Security camera footage shows a suspect parking the white Dodge Caravan believed to have been used in the kidnap one block from Menachem Stark's Brooklyn office, just before 5pm on January 2.

The father-of-eight was grabbed later that night, bound with duct tape and driven off in a vehicle thought to be the one in the footage.

Suspect: A man believed to have been involved in the kidnap and murder of Menachem Stark is seen on security camera footage

In the newly released footage, one of the suspects in the case is seen walking from the van past Mr Stark's office, before returning to the vehicle where he remained for hours, sources told the New York Post.

'He was definitely casing the guy,' a 
source said of the suspect, who was wearing a light jacket and a cap pulled low over his head.

The footage is one of several security camera tapes viewed by New York police since Mr Stark's body was found in a dumpster.

They are also searching through toll booth footage and repair shop and rental car record to try to get more information about the minivan, which had Ohio license plates.

The widow of Mr Stark, 39, told detectives that she saw a minivan parked near the family home about a week before her husband was kidnapped. 

Several witnesses have also claimed to have seen the parked van and have given a description of the driver.

Investigation: Footage shows the suspect parking a white minivan believed to have been used in the kidnap

The suspect has been seen in other footage in Mr Stark's neighborhood, dating back to December 19.

Mr Stark was reported to have been in debt, and tenants in the rental properties he owned in Brooklyn allegedly had lists of complaints about conditions.

According to public records seen by the New York Post, Mr Stark and his business partner Israel Perlmutter owed more than $40 million to creditors.

Detectives are investigating whether his killing was a professional hit ordered by someone he owed money to.

Although Mr Stark's abduction was caught on camera, a snowstorm obscured the footage, blocking out his attackers' faces and the full license plate.

His body was found the following day. Police believe he was suffocated before being wrapped in fabric and set on fire.

Although he was reported missing to the Shomrim neighborhood patrol just before midnight, his kidnap was not reported to New York police until 2am.

'I don’t know if we could have
 saved his life, but I will tell you that it’s unlikely that minivan 
would have made it out to Long Island. The weather was horrible that 
night. The LIE was closed. It would have been a real challenge for [the 
kidnappers] to get out there while we’re looking for them,' a police source said.

A spokesman for Shomrim declined to comment to the Post.
