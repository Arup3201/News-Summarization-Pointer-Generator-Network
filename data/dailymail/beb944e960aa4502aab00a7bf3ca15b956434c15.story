In a tactical war-room at Newcastle United's training ground – decorated with canvas prints of goal celebrations and team huddles – a sign on the wall reads: 'It is not about blame, we are all accountable'.

John Carver, however, wants to be accountable, he wants to be the man tasked with leading his home-town club.

The final 13 games of this season will determine his fate on that front, but finish in the top 10 – they are currently 11th – and the job is his.

John Carver has 13 games left to ensure Newcastle secure a top 10 finish in the Premier League

Earlier this week, managing director Lee Charnley felt moved to issue a statement urging fans to support Carver and the team. He was responding to chants of 'Are you Pardew in disguise?' which were aimed at the head coach during last week's 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.

But Carver is determined to prove he is his own man with his own ideas. In the tactics room this week he pored over video clips of the game at Selhurst Park with his players, comparing their performance to training-ground footage – a new initiative under Carver – and offering advice, criticism and praise.

Repetition is his aim until it becomes the norm. Every time he sees Ayoze Perez – be it in the tactics room, changing room or dining room – he reminds him that strikers only score goals in the penalty box. There is footage, from Palace, of Perez missing out on a certain goal as the ball drops in the six-yard area. He, meanwhile, is coming into frame on the edge of the box.

Then there is a clip of Harry Kane pressurising defenders. Above the head of the Spurs striker is the name Papiss Cisse – it is clear who Carver wants his Senegal frontman to replicate when it comes to work-rate. Subsequent action shows Cisse doing just that in the following game.

Carver has also tweaked the 4-2-3-1 formation he inherited from Alan Pardew, explaining the weaknesses of that system in certain scenarios.

But he is also open to the input of others. On Wednesday, he sought the guidance of some 10-year-old schoolboys at his golf club.

'I asked one lad what his formation would be and to write down his team on a piece of paper. He had two defenders in a 2-6-2 system - I told him we would do that against Manchester City!' laughs Carver, who takes his side to the Etihad on Saturday afternoon.

But there are more serious issues for him to address, such as the unrest which triggered Charnley's call for calm.

'When people start having a go I can half understand that, because if I was a fan in the stands I'd be having a go myself at times,' he says.

'But it takes away from the importance of supporting the team. I'm trying to create something here.

'This hasn't just happened, this hasn't been given to me on a plate. I've had to work extremely hard for it.

'So it is important to make sure there is a relationship between me and the fans and that they understand I only want the best for this club.'

Back in the analysis room, Carver explains the threat which City will pose tonight, dragging their players towards Newcastle's goal at every point of attack on a magnetic tactics board. At the same time he shines his laser pen towards the sparsely-populated City half. His intention is clear. He has a plan and he's taking responsibility for it.
