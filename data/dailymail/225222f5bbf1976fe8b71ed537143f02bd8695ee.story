You'd have to be a very brave man to follow in Patrick Swayze’s footsteps in only the third week of Strictly Come Dancing.

Well, either that or an Olympic gymnast. Louis Smith looked more than happy to take on the challenge as he practised with professional dance partner Flavia Cacace this week.

The pair are set to recreate some of the famous sequences from the 1987 film Dirty Dancing, starring Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

It takes two: Flavia and Louis look into each other's eyes (top), just as Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey did in the 1987 film (bottom)

Miss Cacace, who was partnered by astrologer Russell Grant last year, seems – understandably – to be making the most of having Smith as her dance partner.

The 23-year-old, who won silver and bronze at this summer’s Games, has impressed the judges so far, and he and Miss Cacace are currently joint top of the judge’s leaderboard.

No doubt keen to maintain that position, the pair have spent hours this week training for their take on Dirty Dancing.

Photos released from rehearsals show them recreating the well-known scenes in which Frances ‘Baby’ Houseman, played by Miss Grey, is put through her paces by Swayze’s Johnny Castle.

On last week’s show, Smith’s waltz to the song Puppy Love left the judges gushing with praise.

Len Goodman described it as ‘the best dance of the night’ while Bruno Tonioli praised Smith’s ‘great movement and musicality’. And Darcey Bussell spoke of his ‘calm confidence’ and ‘ease’ on the dance floor.

Meanwhile judge, prima ballerina Darcey Bussell spoke of his ‘calm confidence’ and ‘ease’ on the dance floor.

And despite being tipped by the bookies to win the show, Mr Smith said before that he did not feel like the favourite.

Speaking a few weeks ago before the first live show, he said is learning like everyone else.

He said: ‘I am learning the cha-cha-cha at the moment and it’s really hard work because it’s so quick.

'I haven’t quite nailed the routine; it’s not realty my dancing skill set.'

But judging by these pictures it seems the Olympic gymnast could end up ‘pommelling’ his way to the final.
