Neil Warnock has praised Everton manager Roberto Martinez ahead of his side's trip to Goodison Park on Sunday, by claiming that the Spaniard's next job will be at Barcelona or Real Madrid.

The Crystal Palace manager, who joined the club last month after Tony Pulis' exit, cited Martinez's passion and composure as two traits that will help him make it to the very top of the game.

'I think his next job will be one of the top two clubs in Spain. I think he's that kind of manager - he's done everything right.

'He's built up from the lower reaches, he's handled every level and players want to play for him.'

Warnock, who himself has been in management for 34 years, recalled a previous meeting he had with Martinez.

'I remember saying to him, "do you ever shout?" He is such a gentleman but he does care and he's very passionate. You see it occasionally, he just lets it slip.

'I think we all have our ways and I think everyone cares differently - it doesn't mean because you rant and rave on the touchline you're more passionate than somebody who never says a word.' 

Warnock and Palace travel to Goodison Park on Sunday looking to recreate their 2-3 win from last season, but are sweating on the fitness of Marouane Chamakh, who missed last week's draw against Burnley with a hamstring injury.

Everton's only doubt is right-back Seamus Coleman, who sustained a knock on the head against Wolfsburg in midweek, and will undergo a late fitness test.

Samuel Eto'o could start his first game at Goodison Park for the Toffees, as Everton look to break into the top half of the Premier League.
