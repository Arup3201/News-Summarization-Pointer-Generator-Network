Crash: A crane smashed into the roof of a McDonald's outlet in Consett, County Durham, at about 1pm today

Delivery: The vehicle had been delivering a new chiller unit to the fast food restaurant, which stands on a busy road outside the town centre

Locals flocked to the scene to 
take photos of the toppled vehicle, which damaged the roof above what is 
thought to be the kitchen area.

Brett Cooper, 41, who witnessed the incident, said: 'I'm not sure if it was lifting a freezer or an air con unit, but it seems to have just gone over.'

The McDonald's 'drive-thru', which stands on a busy road outside the town centre, had been closed at the time - however, its restaurant was still open.

'There were people in there when the crane went through,' said Mr Cooper, a geologist from Consett. 'I think they will need another crane to get it out.'

Stunned: Locals flocked to the scene to take photos of the toppled vehicle, while employees gathered outside the damaged restaurant

Stunned employees gathered outside the restaurant, while officers from Durham Police warned passing 
motorists not to take photographs while driving.

A McDonald's spokesman said the popular fast food outlet will remain closed while the damage inflicted by the crane is assessed.

He said: 'This afternoon, a crane has caused damage to the roof of our Consett restaurant.

'The crane had been on site to carry out scheduled development work and toppled while moving an outdoor chiller unit.

'Thankfully
 nobody was injured. The safety of our customers and employees is our 
top priority and the restaurant will remain closed while the damage is 
fully assessed.'
