Research has discovered the Spanish, in particular, are hooked on their gadgets and spend eight hours 48 minutes a day outside of work on their devices.

In comparison, Britons use devices 6 hours 54 minutes a day, and Finland use them for just six hours.

However, despite Spain’s tech addiction, Italians spend the most on tech every quarter, at £444 on average, compared to £291 across Europe as a whole.

The UK sits below this on £218.

The results were taken from the Technonomic Index, commissioned by the European Samsung Lifestyle Research Lab in partnership with Ipsos MORI.

Ipsos MORI interviewed 5,000 adults aged between 18 and 65 from 14 to 28 April.

The research also focused specifically on the UK for a selection of questions.

Following these online interviews, the study found that the average UK household has 19 technological devices - against an European average of 18.

Two thirds of Britons use their mobiles to access apps, with gaming and entertainment proving to be the most popular.

In addition, the popularity of streaming and download TV services such as Netflix continues to rise with 60 per cent of British adults claiming to have streamed TV and film services.

And 62 per cent of these respondents stated they use these services at least once a week.

A further one in ten households said they have four mobiles per home, and one in ten households have more than four TVs.

Tablet ownership is also popular, according to the study, with 38 per cent of British households now having one tablet device.

More than one in five (22 per cent) admitted that their reason for buying a tablet was to treat themselves.

According to figures from another recent study, the average viewer spends six hours 50 minutes a day switching between a smartphone, a tablet, TV or a PC monitor.

And across the 30 countries surveyed, Indonesians topped the chart with a staggering nine hours of daily screen time.

At the other end of the screen-time scale, Italians spend just five hours 17 minutes looking at their gadgets each day.
