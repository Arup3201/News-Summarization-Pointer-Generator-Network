End game: A judge may rule next week on whether Shrien Dewani, pictured, has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to murder his wife

Shrien Dewani's lawyers today said they would apply for all charges against him to be dropped as prosecutors abruptly closed their case against him.

Judge Jeanette Traverso may rule next week on whether the 34 year-old businessman has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to kidnap and murder his wife, Anni.

If she decides in favour of Dewani, he could boarding a plane back to Britain – a free man - within hours.

If not, his lawyers will have to decide whether to put him in the witness box to give his version of events – and face tough questions about what happened on the night his new bride was murdered.

The decision by defence lawyers to apply to have the case against Dewani dismissed - under section 174 of the Criminal Procedures Act - was not unexpected following a series of blows to prosecution.

One of the compelling elements in the case against Dewani was motive – the fact that he had a secret gay life was, prosecutors concluded, a powerful reason for wanting to be out of his new marriage.

However, when on day one of the trial, Dewani informed the court that he was bi-sexual and frequented male prostitutes, clubs, chat rooms and extreme websites – much of the evidence compiled by the state relating to Dewani's sexuality was later ruled inadmissible by the judge.

A gay escort, called 'the German Master,' whom Dewani had paid for three sex sessions, involving drugs, physical and verbal abuse and role play, was allowed to give only brief live testimony.

A bundle of sexually-explicit emails between Dewani and an unnamed older lover were also ruled inadmissible.

Testimony from the Swedish bride's first cousin and confidante, Sneha Mashru, was also excluded following a successful application by defence lawyers.

Lawyers Francois van Zyl and Pieter Botha were also successful in highlighting discrepancies in the evidence of 'star' prosecution witnesses – taxi driver Zola Tongo and hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe.

Zola told the court he had been recruited by Dewani to organise the contract killing of his new wife, within minutes of dropping the newlyweds at their honeymoon hotel.

Qwabe told the court that he had been hired by Tongo who said he had 'a husband who wanted his wife killed.'

Victim: Anni Dewani was found killed by a bullet through her neck after the cab she was riding in with her husband on their honeymoon in Cape Town was hijacked as it travelled through a township

Prosecutors brought their case to a sudden close following a meeting in which the two sides led to agreement on evidence related to calls and messages between Dewani, Tongo and the hitmen and also the results of primer residue tests.

A source close to the defence said the decision to apply for the case to be discharged 'is never made lightly', but added 'we wouldn't apply for a discharge unless we had some confidence about our chances of success.'

The family of Mrs Dewani – who marked the fourth anniversary of her death last week with a visit to the township road where she was found dead from a fatal gun shot wound to the neck – looked tense and anxious as the court was adjourned.

The defence will compile written arguments in favour of having the case against Dewani discharged and submit them to the judge by the end of Wednesday. The prosecution will then have until the end of Friday to challenge them.

The Judge will hear the arguments in open court on Monday - after that, she could announce her decision straight away, or ask for time to consider.
