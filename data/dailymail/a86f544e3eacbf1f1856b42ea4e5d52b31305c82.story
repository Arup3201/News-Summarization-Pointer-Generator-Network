The University of Louisville basketball player who suffered a horrific leg fracture that left the bone in his right leg protruding on live TV has been successfully operated on.

Kevin Ware, 20, jumped high in the air to block a three-point shot during the Louiseville-Duke game on Sunday night when he landed badly on the leg as he crashed to the court.

Team-mates and Coach Rick Pinoto were in tears as Ware screamed with pain and writhed on the court. He has since had the bone reset, a rod inserted into the leg and the wound closed during a two-hour operation.

Hurt: Ware, 20, is comforted by teammate Luke Hancock after the horrific injury. He was quickly loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital

Inspiration: Despite unimaginable pain, Ware reportedly told teammates not to worry about him and to focus on winning the game

A recovery time has not yet been set though it will inevitably be lengthy. It is thought the injury will not be career ending.

An official told several reporters that a
bone snapped. Trainers immediately covered the leg with a towel and 
placed Ware on a backboard, then lifted him onto a stretcher.

CBS reported that Ware whispered encouragement to his team as he was carried away: 'Don't worry about me. I'll be OK. Go win this thing.'Â 

Ware's teammates responded to the 
shock of his loss by returning to the court with a vengeance. The second
half of the game saw Louisville dominate Duke - clobbering the Blue 
Devils 85-63.

Louisville will plays Wichita State in the Final Four next weekend. The winner of that game plays for the NCAA men's basketball championship.

His teammates held up a jersey with Ware's name as they celebrated their resounding victory.

Silence fell over Lucas Oil Stadium 
in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Elite Eight game was being played, 
as horrified fans waited for news of Ware's condition.

The injury occurred with 6:33 left in
the first half as Duke's Tyler Thornton made a 3-pointer to get the 
Blue Devils within 21-20. Ware tried to contest the shot and his leg 
buckled when he landed, bending gruesomely.

Sickened: Ware's teammates sobbed on the court after seeing their friend so badly injured during the game

Emotional: Despite being devastated by Ware's injury, the Cardinals took charge of the game during the second half, leading Duke by more than ten points

The injury happened in front of the Louisville bench, and the Cardinals were overcome with emotion.

Russ Smith collapsed onto the floor, along with several players, and was clearly crying as doctors attended to Ware.

As Ware was being loaded onto a stretcher, the Cardinals gathered at midcourt until coach Rick Pitino called them over, saying that Ware wanted to talk to them before he left.

Pitino wiped away his eyes as Ware was wheeled out, as did several of the Louisville players.

Former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who famously sustained a broken leg during a Monday night football game against the New York Giants, tweeted, 'Watching Duke/ Louisville my heart goes out to Kevin Ware.'

Even Rick Pitino, the hardened coach of the Louisville Cardinals, fought back tears as his player was carted away from the court

The Cardinals consoled each other as they struggled to come to terms with the graphic injury that witnessed in front of their bench

'Worst thing I've ever seen on a basketball court,' tweeted Yahoo basketball analyst Pat Forde.

Ware, a native of the Bronx, New York, is a sophomore guard who has become a force on the number-one-ranked Cardinals team during the NCAA Tournament.

ESPN.com reports he could undergo surgery tonight at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.

Team officials say his pain is 'under control.'
