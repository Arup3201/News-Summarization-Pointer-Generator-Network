Theo Walcott has revealed the extent of the horrifying knee injury that left this World Cup dream in tatters.

The 25-year-old has been out since sustaining a nasty injury during Arsenal's FA Cup third round win over Tottenham in January.

Having had to undergo surgery, it was clear that Walcott wouldn't be back in time for the World Cup, which commences on June 12.

The Arsenal forward was taken off on a 
stretcher during their 2-0 win over Tottenham at the Emirates in the FA 
Cup third round, when he trod on the ball during a challenge with Danny Rose.

As he left the pitch, he aimed a cheeky salute to the Spurs 
fans, reminding them of the score.

This prompted an angry reaction and some visiting supporters threw coins, some of which hit the paramedics carrying Walcott from the field.

He managed six goals in 18 appearances for Arsenal before injury ruined his season and World Cup chances. Without him the Gunners won the FA Cup, their first trophy for nine years.

Having made his international debut in 2006, Walcott has scored five times for England but missed out on their World Cup squad four years ago.
