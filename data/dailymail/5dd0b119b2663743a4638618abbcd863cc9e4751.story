An unemployed man won a £53,000 Porsche and £10,000 in cash after spending £250 of his benefits money on a spot-the-ball contest.

Andrew Boyce, 52, bought 50 £5 tickets when he saw the competition in his local shopping centre. But he was criticised last night for using his benefits on a frivolous competition instead of essentials.

One neighbour said last night: ‘It’s sickening that I have to work two jobs to feed my family and that prat is spending my taxes spotting balls.’

Another resident added: ‘Welcome to benefits Britain. Will he declare his good fortune to the benefits office? It makes me wonder how much else he has spent trying to win something.’

Mr Boyce, from Leyton, East London, receives disability benefits after breaking his back in a car crash in 2004.

The former driver for Waltham Forest council said last night: ‘It’s difficult to get a job when you’ve got a broken back.

'I’ve
 not been well and it’s got me down. But this has cheered me up. I 
wasn’t going to put all my benefits on – it was controlled. I’m not an 
addicted gambler.’

The bachelor, who was driving a 15-year-old Ford Escort before winning the Porsche Boxster GTS, said the new car’s leather interior ‘should cushion my back’.

Mr Boyce said he would tell welfare officals of his win and intended to continue claiming benefits.

Mr Boyce has shrugged off criticism of his win, insisting he can spend his benefits money on whatever he likes

He also insisted his critics were merely envious, adding: ‘I won and I was so happy – but it’s frustrating now because people are complaining that I spent benefits on it. What has it got to do with anyone?

‘It’s ridiculous. I got a bit of good fortune and it’s no one’s business how that happened. It’s giving people with benefits bad publicity because it looks like we’ve got money to throw around. I don’t gamble, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t have meals out.

'I just sit at home and watch telly. I’ve gone from rags to riches – it’s like Only Fools And Horses.

'People are just negative and jealous and want to bring others down. I’ve been unwell and that’s why I’m on benefits.

'I’ve been unemployed for a while. There’s not a lot of work around at the moment.’

He said his bad back and 6ft 3in frame made getting in and out of the Escort a challenge, adding: ‘The Porsche will be a lovely change.’

However, Mr Boyce, who has already sold his purple Ford to a local garage for £400, said he would probably have to sell the Porsche eventually because he cannot afford to run it.

He is planning to spend some of the £10,000 on a holiday to ‘somewhere nice and hot’, and said he may also give some to charity.

He discovered he had won when William Hindmarch, whose company Best Of The Best runs the competition, surprised him at his terraced home on Tuesday.

After being shown the car, which had a briefcase with £10,000 in cash in the boot, Mr Boyce sprayed champagne in the street, saying: ‘It’s absolutely brilliant. I think I could get used to this.’

Mr Hindmarch said: ‘He was pretty speechless. No one expects to be swapping from a Ford Escort to a Porsche on the same day.’

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People can spend their benefits on whatever they want.

'But taxpayers’ anger that their cash has been used to win a swanky Porsche is understandable.

‘There’s nothing to stop Mr Boyce giving some of the cash back to the Government, and plenty of people will expect he’ll do just that.’
