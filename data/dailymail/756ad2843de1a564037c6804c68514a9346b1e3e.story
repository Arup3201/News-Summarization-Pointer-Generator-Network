Didier Drogba was utterly exhausted and emotionally drained as he and John Terry held each other up through a post-match flash interview.

It was as if these two warriors might collapse on camera if either of them moved, so they clung on and spoke happily if wearily after supplying the goals which fuelled this fight-back at Leicester.

Drogba is into his 38th year and could be doing something a little more leisurely than leading the line through 90 minutes at the sharp end of the season. Centre-forward is a demanding role in any team, let alone one of Jose Mourinho’s.

But he and Terry are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team-mates to salute three thousand noisy Chelsea supporters in the corner of the King Power Stadium.

They had trailed to a goal from Marc Albrighton after a slightly lethargic first-half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through Drogba, before Terry put the Londoners ahead, 12 minutes from time, and Ramires curled the third into the top corner.

The strike by Ramires triggered an ironic chorus of 'Boring Boring Chelsea' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night, aware that their team can be crowned champions on Sunday at Stamford Bridge if they beat Crystal Palace.

Mourinho tried to play down the party vibe but they will come in expectation because this has the feel of a procession after breaking through an awkward sequence of games with only one fit centre-forward, who happened to be 37.

Drogba’s legs don’t cover quite the same ground at quite the same rate as they once did. He rarely gets clear of the back-line, it has been a long time since he screamed one into the top corner and his touch can be heavy.

Until Wednesday night it had been a long time since he found the net. You have to go all the way back to Newcastle away in December, when he came on in a bid to rescue Chelsea from their first defeat of the campaign, and almost managed it. 

Drogba has an impossible-to-pin-down ability to influence the game and his desire glows as fiercely as ever. He energised Chelsea with the equaliser - just as he once did in Munich in the Champions League final.

He missed chances and he might have scored more, but he never stopped showing for the ball or leading by example to those team-mates who have yet to cross this finish-line in a title race, as injured striker Diego Costa and Loic Remy looked on from the stands.

Mourinho wanted all of his squad to travel and prepare together at St George’s Park as a show of solidarity as they closed in on the goal.

This was where the head-tennis video was filmed which went viral on Wednesday. 

Six Chelsea players headed the ball back and forth across the dinner table until it reached John Obi Mikel, on the end, who nodded it into a bin. Judging by the celebrations which followed, Remy is not far from a return.

On Wednesday, it was over to the legends who have made the journey before to respond to the challenge set down by Nigel Pearson’s vibrant team, who offered more evidence, even in defeat, that they are capable of surviving the drop.

Terry scored his seventh of the season, forcing the ball in from close range after Kasper Schmeichel had saved from Gary Cahill at a corner.

And Petr Cech came in for Thibaut Courtois and played superbly, making a crucial save to thwart Paul Konchesky when the game was goalless.

Courtois hurt his hip during Sunday’s draw at Arsenal and was on the bench. Cech came in for only his fifth Premier League game of the season, but buoyed by the knowledge he had not conceded in this competition for more than a year.

Leicester started at a healthy tempo, seeking to use the electric pace of Jamie Vardy, only to see their rhythm disrupted to injuries which forced Andy King and Robert Huth off before the interval.

Chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent Leicester from taking the lead on the break when Matty James released Vardy down the left.

Vardy beat Terry to the ball and cut his cross low and deep. It might have been aimed at Leonardo Ulloa, but it bypassed the Argentine striker and Cesar Azpilicueta slipped as he tried to adjust his feet.

The upshot was a simple finish for Albrighton, arriving late with the ball set nicely and Cech’s goal hopelessly exposed. He had not scored for more than four years but he made no mistake, sliding it low into the net.

The King Power erupted as home fans detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company.

But Drogba soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute Ritchie de Laet to a low cross from Branislav Ivanovic and hooked it past Schmeichel.

It was a different game from this point. Chelsea had re-emerged in a different mood. There was extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a 5-0 win against Swansea in mid-January.

Drogba fired one chance over and another wide but Terry produced the second, just as it seemed Mourinho would have to settle for a point.

It could have been many more but Ramires made it three. And it wasn’t boring at all.
