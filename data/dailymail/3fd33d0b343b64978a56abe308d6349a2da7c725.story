In the wake of the Christchurch office sex romp-which saw a married father caught cheating in a string of viral images-many are questioning how much they can trust their partners.

For some, this means enlisting extra support to give them peace of mind, and that’s where Lipstick Investigations come into play.

The Sydney based company is Australia's highest profile investigation business to specialise in infidelity, and they've been flooded with business in the New Year.

Lipstick Investigations is Australia's highest profile investigation business, and they say they have been inundated with business of late

Managing director of the company David King said: 'It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure'

David King, the managing director of the company, told Daily Mail Australia the investigations are conducted across a number of fields.

‘We primarily deal with surveillance, but we also delve into database work and internet investigations. It varies from case to case,’ he said.

Investigations typically begin with a phone call to the client, which sees the investigator ask two dozen questions to establish the plan of attack.

‘It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure. It’s can also come down to cultural differences.’

King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs, such as computer hacking and electronic tagging

Clients are charged a flat rate of $95 an hour, and while some jobs take a handful of hours, some can drag on much longer.

‘We had one client who spent half a million dollars over four years. We had plenty of evidence, but it was a drawn out case and it ended up becoming quite complicated.'

King says the company also handles an array of other investigative work.

‘Private investigations are a very small industry. We take on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie.’

King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs.

‘We’re pretty hard up. We can’t do electronic tracking, can’t hack into accounts. The office incident in New Zealand would be an ideal result for us, because that’s working within the parameters of the law.’

He said most of his results come from conventional surveillance, which includes the use of forensic tools, hidden cameras and night-vision equipment.

They also arrange honey-trapping job, where a decoy is sent into partners favourite watering hole or gym to flirt with them and see what happens next, to catch out infidelity before it has even happened.

‘Social media has really transformed the industry. There is a drop in business because people can do the process themselves, chasing the leads of their partner on Facebook and such.’

‘The other side of the coin is social media means there are more digital footprints left that could spark suspicion. So we can more clients from that. I think the overall workload is the same, it’s just a different dynamic.’

King says the work is consistent throughout the year, with a surge in business on certain obvious dates such as Valentine’s Day.

‘You can never put your finger on busy times. We just had the busiest January since we started our business, but I couldn’t tell you why.’

A recent study from Lonergran Research showed that one in four Australian's admits to cheating on their partner, while two-thirds of couples don’t share their deepest secrets

When asked if the investigators ever get caught in the act, King said: ‘Ultimately we’re not invisible, and we do get caught out sometimes. We can’t be ten blocks behind the suspect.’

He said investigations have about an 80 per cent success rate, but that ‘it would be a 90 per cent if clients had more money. Generally, if you have suspicions they are probably warranted.’
