Still thinking about the guy with the sweet smile you fleetingly passed on your way to work? You may even have locked eyes for a brief moment before watching him disappear into the abyss.

Well now there's an app to ensure those opportunities for romance don't pass you by. French innovation happn sells itself on being the app that saves us from missed connections.

When you cross paths with someone in real life, which in happn land means being within a 250m radius, you flash up on each other's screens.

It's a crush! When both happn users 'like' each other the app allows a conversation to commence

Then much like Tinder, if you're interested in their suggestion, you press the heart to 'like' the match.

When there's mutual appreciation, the app announces 'It's a crush!' and a (flirty) conversation can commence.

The app has already been a huge hit on French home soil, attracting 150,000 users and since launching in the UK five weeks ago, 25,000 hopeful Brits have followed their lead.

Unlike its mighty Silicon Valley rival Tinder, which now has 10 million users worldwide, the Parisian happn is a hook-up site with heart, and has a slightly more romantic premise.

Second chance: The new app will show you who you've crossed paths with - in case you want to meet again

The website explains: 'He would have liked to meet you, you would have liked to talk to him. Find each other again.

'With happn, discover the people you’ve crossed paths with, the people you like, the people you'd like to find again!'

The app was set up by three Parisians - Fabien Cohen, a legal hacker, Didier Rappaport, a serial entrepreneur, and Antony Cohen, a computer engineer. It seems it's on the path to worldwide dating domination with Berlin also now on the happn map.

The app is also designed to guarantee the safety of the users and the confidentiality of their data.

Users positions are not saved and remain completely invisible to other members. Only the position of where two people have passed each other is registered.

Happn makes a promise that it will never publish anything about its members on Facebook and it also makes rejection totally painless.

You can decide at any given time that a profile doesn’t interest you anymore and you’ll never cross paths with each other on happn again.

The rejected party will never even know they've been given the happn boot.

You can also report any unwanted behaviour or block a profile by clocking 'report' on the person's profile.

The happn advertising campaign focuses on those moments that could have been

How do hopeful happn-ites rate the app? 'Happn l'application magnifique' tweets one happy Frenchman.

'Happn
 is literally the most useful app ever,' gushes another Scottish user. 
'See a hot guy in the street? You can get to talk to him just by passing
 by.'

As far as we know there's yet to be a happn wedding, but we predict romance ahead.
