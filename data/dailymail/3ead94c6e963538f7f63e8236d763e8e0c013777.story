The 'perfect Christmas tree' has gone on sale in Ohio. The catch? It comes with a $2,500 price tag.

Breezewood Gardens, a gardening business in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, is home to the eye-wateringly expensive 18-foot Christmas tree, Fox 8 Cleveland reports.

Owner David Kay says says the hand-picked live Fraser Fir, which boasts 'good needle retention', is from the North Carolina woods and was sent first class to Ohio.

'These are customers we have been dealing with for years and they expect the perfect tree', he told Fox 8 Cleveland.

Mr Kay also described what a perfect Christmas tree requires a straight trunk and must be full 'all the way around'.

If you're budget doesn't stretch to Breezewood Garden's perfect tree, there are another two trees that cost over a grand, as well as a wide selection that cost hundreds of dollars.

According to Forbes, the average American will spend around $41.50 on a real tree. It is a $4.3bn industry and an estimated 25 million trees were sold in the U.S. in 2011.

In 2010 a luxury hotel in Abu Dhabi boasted a jewel-encrusted Christmas tree decorated with baubles worth over £7million.

As well as more traditional decorations, the tree's branches were draped with gem-encrusted jewellry. The tree alone was reportedly worth $10,000.

Of course, there are Christmas trees that make Breezewood's price tags seem reasonable but they come with more than just pine needles. For example, a 20-foot tree made entirely of diamonds and crystal owned by Soo Kee Jewellery store was valued at $1.6 million in 2007.

The world's most expensive artificial Christmas tree was designed and made by the Tokyo-based jewellery designer Ginza Tanaka.

The 2.4metre tree has 48kg of pure gold and is decorated with Disney characters, according to Here In The City. Perfect if you have $4.2million burning a hole in your back pocket.

One canny entrepreneur has set up a business that allows families to rent a tree and have it delivered and then picked up from their home. The Living Christmas Company in California even offers customers the option of 'adopting' a tree year-after-year.

The U.S. Christmas tree industry is reportedly worth $4.3billion
