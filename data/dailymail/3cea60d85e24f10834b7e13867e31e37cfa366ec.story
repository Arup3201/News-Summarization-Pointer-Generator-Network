There's something about these surreal artworks that really draws you in to their creator's imagination.

And as these inventive pictures show, Ben Heine is one of the most hands-on artists you are likely to find.

The 28-year-old Belgian blurs the line 
between art and reality by blending photographs of people and landscapes
 with his own pencil sketches.

A randy rabbit, a beat-boxing sparrow 
and a woman trapped in her own nightmare are among the bizarre 
imaginings of the Ivory Coast-born artist.

He begins by taking a picture of an everyday scene then covers part of the shot with a sketch - transforming the bland backdrops into intriguing scenarios.

Part
of his method involves him ensuring his hand is visible in every 
picture - to represent the connection between the viewer, the artist and
the artwork.

Ben said: 'I find a location, then do the drawings, then take a photo to combine with the drawing. I like to stretch people's imaginations.'

Ben, who studied journalism but now 
works as a full time artist in Brussels, has used locations in London, Spain, Tunisia, and Belgium for his work.

Ben said: 'Drawing or taking the photo
 isn't really a challenge as I've been doing it a long time, but it is 
very time consuming.

'People are usually surprised and intrigued by my work, many want me to create a Pencil Vs Camera image with their own photos.'

Heine describes himself as a multidisciplinary visual artist who is inspired by people and nature.
