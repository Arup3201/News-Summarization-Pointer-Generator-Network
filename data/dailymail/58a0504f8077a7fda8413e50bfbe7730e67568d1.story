Energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices, it is claimed today.

The estimate, by consumer group Which?, equates to a total extra cost of £2.9billion.

The figures paint a damning picture of the Big Six energy companies, which stand accused of lining their own pockets while customers struggle to pay bills.

The firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power – have announced small price reductions in recent weeks, ranging from £9 to £35 a year.

However, the wholesale price of gas has fallen by 28 per cent compared with a year ago, while the price of electricity is down by 15 per cent.

Just last week, energy regulator Ofgem published average profit margin figures for the major suppliers, showing an increase of almost 50 per cent in the past year.

The watchdog is so concerned that energy firms are failing to pass falling prices on to customers that it has ordered a wide-ranging investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

While this could change how energy firms operate in the long term, Ofgem is unable to force them to cut bills immediately.

Which? tracked wholesale prices and energy bills to establish whether customers were getting a fair deal.

A spokesman said: 'We analysed the costs to suppliers of buying wholesale energy since 2013 and compared this against what consumers have paid for wholesale costs through energy bills in the same period.

'We found that the failure of retail prices to align with wholesale costs has cost consumers £2.9billion over the last year, an equivalent of £145 per household on standard tariffs.'

Which? found that a raft of sharp price rises by firms on gas just before winter 2013 were not justified by any change in the wholesale cost.

It said customers' bills have since remained high, despite continuing falls in what the firms are paying.

Its figures suggest recent price cuts on gas of between 1.3 and 5.1 per cent should have been much higher – between 8.8 and 10.3 per cent – while firms could have also cut electricity prices by up to 10 per cent.

The group has submitted its findings to the inquiry being carried out by the CMA and to the Treasury, which is also investigating.

Which? wants the CMA to set up a new regime that will allow Ofgem to establish a 'price to beat'.

This would be a gas and electricity tariff it considers fair to consumers, while also allowing the energy firms to make a decent profit.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Our analysis places a massive question mark over how suppliers have been setting prices over the last two years. They now need to explain to their customers why bills don't fall further in response to dropping wholesale prices.'

Energy firms have attempted to blame Labour for the fact that recent price cuts have been smaller than customers would like.

Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices until 2017 should Labour win the General Election, making firms reluctant to reduce tariffs.

Energy UK, which speaks for the energy firms, said bills are now falling. Chief executive Lawrence Slade said: 'The Which? calculations are based on very many assumptions and do not reflect the cheaper deals we are seeing.

'Because energy companies buy ahead to fix prices and to plan … the gas and electricity we are using today has already been paid for.'
