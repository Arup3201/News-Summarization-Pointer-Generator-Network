Andy Burnham roused deflated Labour activists yesterday with a pledge to put the brakes on healthcare privatisation – despite a warning from the head of the NHS that it would be impossible.

A day after Ed Miliband’s lacklustre speech to his party’s conference, the shadow health secretary received a series of standing ovations as he promised a ‘rescue plan for a shattered service’.

But it emerged yesterday that NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens had thrown a spanner in the works by writing to Mr Burnham to dismiss Labour’s call to block all new contracts between hospitals and the private sector.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham had tears in his eyes after 91 year old Harry Smith attacked David Cameron in a speech at the Labour conference

Mr Smith told Labour activists about his childhood growing up in a 'barbarous, bleak and uncivilised' Barnsley slum

Members of the audience were visibly moved by the emotional section of the conference dedicated to the NHS

Embarrassingly for Mr Burnham, Mr Stevens told him that rules introduced by Labour itself in 2006 meant there must be competition over who provides services.

In another blow for Labour, it was revealed that Mr Miliband’s pledge of a cash boost for the NHS actually amounts to less than the budget increase granted by Margaret Thatcher every year she was in power.

On Tuesday, the Labour leader announced a new £2.5 billion fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 extra GPs, 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives. But the money amounts to an increase of just 2.2 per cent on the £111 billion budget planned by the Government.

While Mrs Thatcher was prime minister, the lowest cash increase was 6 per cent – and between 1949 and 2010, the average annual growth in NHS spending was 4 per cent.

Mr Burnham used his speech to pledge that, if Labour wins power, carers will be given better support with funding for breaks and annual health checks.

And there will be a new promise that everyone who wants to die at home rather than in hospital should be able to, if clinically possible.

But much of the barnstorming address was an attack on what he claimed was the Tories’ creeping privatisation of the NHS – even though he signed off on increased use of private firms to provide care when he was Health Secretary.

Shadow Cabinet sources claim Mr Burnham has toughened up his position on privatisation to win support from the Left of the party in anticipation of a leadership bid. ‘Andy’s on manoeuvres,’ said one.

In his speech, Mr Burnham said: ‘The party that created the NHS in the last century today sets out a plan to secure it in this. A rescue plan for a shattered service.

Miss Atkinson said she did not want Jacob to grow up 'saying 'we used to have an NHS for all'

‘But more than that. A vision for a 21st-century NHS there when you need it, personal to you and your family, with time to care.

'A national health and care service based on people before profits. Today we place that proud Labour plan at the centre of our election campaign.’

Mr Burnham said that days into office in 2010, ‘the Tories set about dismantling your NHS’.

'And the plan that dared not speak its name before the last election is now plain for all to see: run it down, break it up, sell it off,’ he said. ‘So today we serve notice on Cameron and Clegg: Thursday, May 7, 2015 – your day of reckoning on the NHS. ’

Mr Burnham added: ‘Our ten-year plan for the NHS is founded on people before profits. We will free the NHS from Cameron’s market and, yes, repeal his toxic Health and Social Care Act.

'We will ask hospitals to collaborate once again and reinstate the NHS as our preferred provider. The public NHS, protected with Labour. Not for sale. Not now, not ever.’

Labour insists the Government’s restructuring of NHS commissioning, which came into force in 2013, has led to privatisation by the back door. 

'But use of the private sector by the NHS doubled in the last four years of Labour, a far bigger increase than under the Coalition.

Since 2010, a further 1.3 per cent of the NHS budget is spent in the private sector, with the total standing at about 6 per cent.

In a letter to Mr Burnham, seen by the Daily Mail, Mr Stevens flatly rejected his call for a moratorium on any new deals with the private sector as impossible.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘David Cameron’s reorganisation forces the tendering of contracts, not the EU.

‘We still believe these large contracts should be halted until there’s an NHS debate at the election.’

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham gave a passionate defence of the health service, urging Labour activists to 'battle for the soul of the NHS'

Mr Burnham's barnstorming speech stole the show at the Manchester central conference centre

The positive reaction from activists came as the party was left reeling by Ed Miliband's meandering speech, in which he forgot whole sections on the deficit and immigration
