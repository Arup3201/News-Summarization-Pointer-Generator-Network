 Fuel retailers are ripping off the public and businesses on diesel charges, according to the RAC.

The wholesale price of diesel is 1p a litre more than for petrol, yet diesel is almost 6p more at the pumps, it said.

There is scope for a diesel price cut of around 4p a litre to restore some parity to the market, the RAC added.

The automotive company calls out retailers, saying businesses in particular are paying excessive charges on Diesel as sales of the fuel increase  

The RAC’s comments came as it highlighted Government figures which showed total fuel sales were up 3.5 per cent in February compared with the same month last year.

Diesel sales last month, at 2.42billion litres, represented the fifth highest monthly total since 1990. 

But petrol sales are among their lowest for 25 years.

Businesses, which are more likely to run on Diesel are being ripped off by retailers who are looking to offset losses from low petrol prices

Because companies traditionally run on diesel, they are particularly hard hit by the fuel rip-off. 

RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘It’s hard not to think that business is being taken for a ride.

'With sales of diesel at an all-time high the retailers have maintained a higher margin on diesel, perhaps to subsidise petrol sales.’
