Accident: Factory worker Niall Page, 17, was crushed to death by a forklift truck just two days before his 18th birthday

A teenage apprentice was killed in a warehouse accident just two days before his 18th birthday, an inquest heard today.

Niall Page, 17, died of a cardiac arrest caused by internal bleeding after he was crushed against a wall by a forklift in February 2011.

The inquest also heard how, on earlier occasions, the youngster, from Irlam in Salford, Greater Manchester, would be raised up while stood on wooden pallets - only for driver James Renton to use the truck's gears to shake the teenager around.

He was seen by and filmed by another colleague shouting 'stop, stop, stop' as he tried to keep his balance while 25-year old Renton was laughing in the driver's seat.

Tragedy struck when Niall - who had been in the job for just five months - was crushed at floor level after jumping into a bay.

The teenager was rushed to hospital where his mother Janet Page works a nurse - but died several hours later.

As the family sat at the hospital, Renton turned up with his head bowed and confessed: 'We have all picked up bad habits. I didn't see him - I just hit him,' the inquest heard.

The accident occurred after workers at Pioneer International Logistics in Trafford Park, Manchester were encouraged by senior staff to 'cut corners' by jumping on the pallets and being raised up to scan in items stored on shelves, the hearing was told.

Keen rugby player Niall, who played guitar in a band and had attended music college, had also been supposed to work 9-5pm hours yet was told to work until 6pm, it was said.

Mrs Page, 45, from Irlam told the hearing at Sale: 'I was concerned about Niall working there in the first place and I didn't think he had the support in the first place that he should have done.

Niall was a keen musician and rugby player. He had only been in the job for five months

Another colleague had filmed Niall being 'shaken' as he stood on the fork of a fork lift truck as he scanned boxes

'He was to be an apprentice and have a mentor. He was doing five days and meant to be doing 9-5pm but when he left at 5pm they said he had to work 9-6pm. I felt like he was being exploited.

'When I said leave the job he declined. He said he wanted to work.'

The inquest was told in the moments before the tragedy Niall was stood in the pallet as it was being raised by the fork of Renton's truck. He was crushed between part of the forklift truck and an interior wall of the building.

His mother had just left work at Salford Royal Hospital when she got a call saying her son had been rushed in following the accident.

Mrs Page added: 'He was conscious and agitated but sat up because he was in pain. I just hugged him first. By this time the police had said that he had walked out in front of the truck and I said, "did you?" He said, "no mum I didn't, I didn't".'

'I said "did Mr Renton see you?" He said, "yes he did", then he drew his knees up because he was in pain. I didn't pursue it any longer, I was just hugging him.'

'Mr Renton came and I remember my husband saying to Niall, "your friend has come to see you".

'He said he didn't see him step out of an empty racking, he said "I didn't see him" and that he "just hit him". Niall was coherent even though he was in pain.'

The inquest heard that management at the warehouse encouraged workers to use the forklifts to raise staff to scan boxes as a time-saving measure

'I was curious, I thought if he had been hit further down below he would have injuries down below. But he had a mark on his face, a pipe mark going down the middle of his face, a cut down his nose and bruising to his abdomen.

'He had no skin on the tips of his fingers.'

'Mr Renton just said they had all picked up bad habits and it was hard to change. All he said was that he stepped out. I knew something wasn't right and my son wasn't a liar either.

'He just sat with his head down. He seemed as though he was sad but he said he had got to go and finish his shift as they wouldn't let him home. We thought it was awful.'

Stephen Holland, a trained forklift truck driver who formerly worked for Pioneer Logistics Ltd, said under safety rules workers at the factory should have scanned in storage items at ground level and not be raised up on pallets.

But he said staff including Niall and another apprentice were instructed to get onto the forks of the forklift trucks and be ferried along the side of the storage racks to scan boxes as a way of 'cutting corners' in order to do the job quicker.

Mr Holland said: 'I just kept quiet because I didn't want to lose my job. The general rule of forklift trucks was that you are responsible for yourself and your colleagues around you.

'The lifting of another person was not allowed but it was your responsibility for the safety of that person.

'I was always driving the trucks but I never let anyone else up. I got told in my training that if you injure the person, you are the one who will get done and could go to jail. It is your duty to look after your environment.

'Some people were raised all the way to the top and I had seen Niall go to the top. The supervisors knew this was going on. They would say "jump on a truck, get James, get a pallet and raise up".

'Niall was on the pallets, James was raising him up sometimes he would shake the truck, messing around and shaking the gears as he went to the top - shaking him down and shaking him.

Stephen Holland, a former employee of Pioneer Logistics, gave evidence at the inquest

'Niall was saying "stop stop stop" but James was laughing. I don't think Niall was scared, he was holding on tight to the metal bar on the front guards.

'I saw him do it quite a few times and filmed him once.'

Mr Holland said on the day of the accident he had been working another shift and added: 'James rang me and said that he had killed Niall.

'He said Niall was in the truck, they were driving down one of the aisles and he was looking for a pallet.

'He lifted Niall up to the first one he scanned the pallet got him down to the bottom and scanned it in to the bay.

'He said Niall jumped out of the truck, James had gone forward. He said Niall jumped off the pallet and into the bay and he hit him in the chest.

'James panicked and has gone forward and hit him twice. He put him on the floor and ran to get some help.'

Niall's fellow apprentice Luke Tabner, now 19, said: 'To save time, people would be lifted onto the fork. It was me and Niall who did it, that's just because we were apprentices.

'We would get asked to do the checks, we didn't really think, we would just do it.

'The way I felt was that they turned a blind eye to it. It didn't seem a big deal until something bad happened. I saw James Renton stood at the gate looking dead pale, he said "I have just hurt Niall".'

The hearing was told both Mr Holland and Mr Tabner had lost their jobs at the warehouse following the tragedy. Renton has been summonsed to give evidence at the hearing.

The inquest continues.
