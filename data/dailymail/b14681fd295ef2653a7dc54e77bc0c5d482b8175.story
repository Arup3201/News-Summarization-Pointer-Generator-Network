When triathlete Tracy Barnes learned she had made the cut for the U.S. Olympic team, she turned and winked at her twin sister Lanny.

After getting sick during the final qualifying races in Ridnaun, Italy, Lanny Barnes thought her Olympic dreams were over after she was the final competitor eliminated and assumed her sister was telling her she would race for her in Sochi.Â 

Both biathletes, from Colorado, have been to the Olympics before - Lanny has been to the previous two Winter Olympics, and Tracy made the team back in 2006.

It was only later on a walk in the Italian Alps that Tracy told her what was really happening: She would give up her spot on the team so Lanny, a three-time Olympian who finished just behind her, would qualify for the team and compete in Sochi instead.

In a beautiful statement that explains her decision, Tracy Barnes said her twin sister Lanny deserved a second chance after failing to make the Winter Olympics team. Tracy said her sibling was having a 'stellar season' before falling ill and that she is honored to be able to help her

'She is my hero and this only shows true
 selflessness and the Olympic spirit,' Lanny Barnes, 32, of Durango said
 via email from Italy.

'This has motivated me even more to not only represent my country but to represent her as well.'

Tracy Barnes, who barely missed qualifying for the 2010 Olympics, was returning home from Italy and couldn't be reached for comment.

In a statement released by the team, Tracy Barnes said her sister had had a stellar season before falling ill and she wanted to give her a second chance.

'And as the old saying goes ...''Only the strong will survive'',' she said in the statement.

'Most of the time, that is the case.

'On occasion the strong don't survive for whatever reason. And that is what I feel happened to Lanny.

'She's having a stellar season and she bound to do great things this year, but she fell ill during the trials and couldn't race.

'Because of that she didn't make the team. While most people would say..''that's biathlon, or that's life'' - and they'd be absolutely correct in saying that - but what if that person who was hit with a little bit of bad luck got a second chance?

'What if someone believed in them enough to give them that chance? Well, that's what I did. Easy decision.

'Lanny is my best friend and my teammate.

'I see how hard she works on a daily basis, so I know firsthand that she is deserving of a spot on the Olympic Team.'

The twins' mother, Deb Barnes, told The Durango Herald that Tracy's motivation to go to the Olympics had waned in the last year.

She is married to Durango Nordic race team coach Gary Colliander, and her mother said they haven't been able to spend much time together because of her heavy travel schedule.

'Tracy is just ready for other things,' Deb Barnes told the newspaper.
