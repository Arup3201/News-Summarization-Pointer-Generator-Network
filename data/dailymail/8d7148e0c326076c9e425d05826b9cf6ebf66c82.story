Fernando Torres will be more fairly treated at AC Milan compared to his time at Chelsea, according to Milan coach Stefano Eranio.

The Spanish striker signed a two-year loan deal with the Italian club last week after a difficult spell in west London where he struggled to find form.

However the former Milan and Derby County winger believes Torres is 'like a car' and will perform if he's looked after.

Eranio told Milan News: 'Torres is a very humble player, he has great technical and human qualities

'In recent years he has not been in contention much and has spent a long time on the Chelsea bench.

'But he is like a car, he needs to play to find his form. He needs the confidence of the coach and to make the most of his surroundings.

'As a coach, I say that I would always want someone like Torres in the team. He arrives in Italy with great enthusiasm, and has specific characteristics that would suit Milan perfectly.'
