From the front, it looks almost intact. A bright orange Lamborghini that would take pride of place in the collection of the wealthiest of car collectors.

Spin round to its rear, however, and you find a smoking heap that you would have a job getting even a scrapyard to take off your hands.

The luxury sports car was reduced to a pile of charred metal after it caught fire on the A81 autobahn near Böblingenin, Germany.

It is thought that the £240,000 boy's toy was on a test run after it had its V12 engine replaced. When something went wrong with the fix, it overheated and burst into flames.

Why someone would need to put a new engine into a car that can already reach 217mph and accelerate from 0-60mph in 2.9 seconds is not known.

As the car's carbon-fibre bodywork went up in flames, its 33-year-old driver and his passenger, whose identities have not been revealed, were able to escape unharmed.

The fire caused an estimated £4,000 worth of damage to the road and crash barrier

Firefighters were called to the the scene but were unable to save the six-figure supercar, which was a total write off.

Its self-immolation caused an estimated £4,000 worth of damage to the road and crash barrier.

Police were forced to close two lanes of the motorway, and there were delays going in the opposite direction as onlookers slowed down to catch a glimpse of the super car going up in smoke.
