Host commentator

Russia take on Belgium next in Group H, they're going to have to improve to trouble Marc Wilmots side. King Capello though, eh?

Meanwhile, South Korea take on Algeria.

That's all from me tonight, I hope you enjoyed the coverage here.

All over here, I'm thankful the second half improved! The heat made it difficult to play with a quick tempo, but both teams seemed content with a draw.

Igor Akinfeev's mistake will live long in the memory...

90+4mins: All over? Kokorin gets in down the left and plays the ball across the six yard box, but Samedov slices it wide at the back post.

90mins: Russia in the ascendancy, they have been much more positive in the last 20 minutes or so. Four minutes added on.

85mins: Just five minutes left here, and you have to say it's been an entertaining second half. I guess anything would be considered exciting after those first 45 minutes though!

Can either team nick a crucial winner?

79mins: What now? This game has certainly livened up.

Unbelievable! Russia equalise immediately.

They look so much better with two up front, and Kerzhakov capitalises after a goalmouth scramble.

Four years ago Capello had to watch on as Rob Green dropped a clanger for England against USA. I think this ones worse...

71mins: Fabio Capello going for it now, on comes another striker.

Dear. Oh. Dear.

This is one of the worst goalkeeping howlers you will ever see. And I'm sorry Igor Akinfeev, but this game needed it.

Substitute Lee Keun-Ho shoots speculatively from 30 yards, straight at the Russian goalkeeper, who practically throws it into his own net.

Really, just... awful.

66mins: Superb ball in from Kombarov from the left, and to be fair to South Korea's goalkeeper he deals with this one well, pucnhing the ball clear.

62mins: Few players dropping with cramp at the moment. Me too lads, me too...

58mins: On comes the Alan Dzagoev, the top scorer from Euro 2012 as a youngster. Dubbed as the next Andrei Arshavin, can he inspire Russia here?

56mins: Off goes the former Arsenal striker, who just like his days in the Premier League, was ineffective tonight.

50mins: This half is much more promising. Ki hits a swerving shot from long range and Akinfeev only just parries on the second attempt.

48mins: Another harsh booking here, this time for a Russian player. Oleg Shatov is slightly late, but I reckon that was his first foul.

46mins: Great start to the second half from Russia. Faizulin has a shot tipped over the bar before Berezoutski nods a header into the side netting.

No goals at the break then... we haven't seen a goal since around 6pm (BST).

South Korea had the best chances in that half and but for some wayward finishing would be in front.

Capello needs to install some belief into his Russia side, they surely need to go for it.

43mins: Looks like we're going to be goalless at half-time. Players trying to pace themselves in this 80 degree humidity.

38mins: What a chance this is for Son Hueng-Min yet again. he dances into the box and creates space to shoot but blazes it miles over the bar. A complete shank.

34mins: Another long range shot, this time from Son Heung-Min, the shot is deflected and with Akinfeev rooted, would have found the net had it been on target. Just wide, though.

33mins: Better from Russia. Kokoring feeds Zhirkov on the left-hand side who drives towards the box. He elects to shoot but gets all wrong, kicking the ground and it's a goal kick.

30mins: Another harsh booking for South Korea, for what seemed to be a 50/50. The resulting free-kick is blasted towards goal by Faizulin and the ball has to be beaten away by the goalkeeper.

27mins: At the moment Russia are only looking dangerous from corners. Jung Sung-Ryong just about manages to claw the latest set-piece away.

Dare I say it, this game needs a goal...

22mins: I mentioned earlier that Russia were the favourites for this, especially after South Korea lost to Ghana 4-0 in their final warm-up game.

But the Asian side are holding their own, with the Russians crying out for some invention.

17mins: Not impressed by Russia at all so far. It's slow, steady and they're lacking creativity. Dare I say it reminds me of England in 2010?

13mins: We saw a lenient referee earlier on, but this is ridiculous. Son Heung-Min is booked, but he barely touched Aleksandr Samedov, who made the most of it.

10mins: More lovely play from South Korea! A fabulous touh from Koo Ja-Choel sets up Heung-Min, but he is a bit selfish and goes for goal himself from the edge of the box instead of laying it off to Chung Yung. He eventually blasts his shot over the bar.

8mins: Decent bit of movement from Son Heung-Min, who dances past a couple of challenges. Russia have had a corner early on but little threat other than that - they seem to be lacking pace on the wing.

4mins: Russia looking to force the pace early on, but South Korea have already shown some technical quality on the ball.

Bolton's Lee Chung-Yong is one to look out for, and he will look to get some joy against an aging defence.

Away we go! Surely not another 0-0 draw? Let's hope for an entertaining game.

Look out for Aleksandr Kokorin for Russia tonight, the 23-year-old has a fine record in his home country.

It is their first World Cup appearance since 2002, coincidentally the year South Korea made the semi-finals...

Son Heung-Min is the danger man for them, and he is partnered up front by former Arsenal flop Park Chu-Young.

Russia have only kept one clean sheet in their last six World Cup games, it was against Tunisia on June 5, 2002 (2-0).

This is South Korea’s eighth World Cup in a row (since 1986); only Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain can boast a longer streak currently.

South Korea have only won two of their last 10 World Cup games (against Togo in 2006 and Greece in 2010).

The one previous meeting between Russia and South Korea came in a friendly in November 2013; Fabio Capello’s side won 2-1.

Including games played as Soviet Union, Russia have lost seven of their last 10 World Cup games, winning the other three.

South Korea have kicked off each of the last three World Cups with a win: v Poland in 2002, Togo in 2006 and Greece in 2010.

South Korea have scored the most direct free-kicks in the World Cup since 1990 (5).Aleksandr Kokorin was the youngest player to score 10 or more goals in the Russian Premier League in 2013-14; he was born in March 1991.

 

South Korea captain Koo Ja-cheol said 'I don't know the (Russian) names themselves. But I know their numbers.'

Rewind four years ago, and Fabio Capello was slammed in the press after a poor performance in South Africa with England.

Can he make up for it with his Russia side tonight? They qualified convincingly and will be the slight favourites for this one.

Never rule out the South Koreans though...

Sung-Ryong; Suk-Young, Young-Gwon, Lee-Yong, Jeong-Ho; Ja-Cheol, K.Young, Sun-Yueng, Chung-Yong; Chu-Young, Heung-Min

Akinfeev, Ignashevich, Glushakov, Kokorin, Berezutskiy, Shatov, Zhirkov, Samedov, Fayzulin, Eshchenko, Kombarov
