A large wave capsized a fishing boat off the coast of Northern California Saturday, leaving four of the five people aboard dead, authorities said.

None of those aboard was  wearing the life vests that were aboard the craft when they went into the 59-degree water, said Sgt. Cecile Focha of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department.

One man survived by swimming to the shores of a rocky islet, where he was rescued by a helicopter crew.

'It's such a tragedy, such a loss,' Focha said.

Four people on a crabbing boat died Saturday off the coast of Northern California, when a wave capsized their vessel, sending a total of five people into the rough and cold water

Only one managed to survive by swimming to shore and some nearby rocks, officials said Saturday.

None of the passengers wore a life vest, which Sgt. Cecile Focha said were available on the boat

The lone survivor, Phillip Sanchez, 66, of Bodega Bay, told rescuers they were returning in the privately owned 32-foot boat, named The Frog, on the opening day of crabbing season

The vessel was part of a flotilla celebrating the start of the annual commercial and recreational crab fishing season, usually held on the first Saturday of November

A mariner reported the overturned boat near Bodega Bay, about 70 miles north of San Francisco, about 10 a.m.

The lone survivor, Phillip Sanchez, 66, of Bodega Bay, told rescuers that they were returning in the privately owned 32-foot boat on the opening day of crabbing season. 

Sanchez said he managed to swim through the 9-foot swells to Bodega Rock.

Using a 100-foot line, a Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office helicopter pulled Sanchez to safety.

Wearing a T-shirt and jeans, Sanchez sustained minor scrapes from the rocks and was very cold from the 59-degree water, Focha said.

A Coast Guard boat retrieved the bodies of the four victims, three men and one woman. Three of the victims were identified late Saturday as Jessie Daniel Langley, 79, Samuel Garcia, 86, and David Costa, 60.

Langley and Garcia were described as colorful residents of Bodega Bay's tight-knit fishing community.

'It's just horrifying,' Kelly Martin, manager of a local grocery store, told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. 'We called Jessie Uncle Jessie.

 That's how well we knew him. He was old-school hillbilly. Sam was the cranky crab guy. Everybody loved Sammy.'

The Coast Guard dispatched a crew that was training nearby when another local mariner reported a boat had capsized. Four people were pulled from the water, but they were unconscious and unresponsive

The lone surivivor, Philip Sanchez says he managed to swim through the 9-foot swells and cling to sharp rocks until a California Highway Patrol helicopter rescued him. Using a 100-foot line the copter pulled him to safety

The boat ended up washed against the shoreline, floating upside down

'This is not protected water,' U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Aaron Bretz said. 

'The water temperature is very cold. This is where you need to have your life jacket on, and you need to understand what kind of weather you're getting into and be extremely careful.'

The accident remains under investigation, he said.
