Prince Harry’s dream of winning a 200-mile race across the Antarctic has been shattered by a string of injuries among the team and safety fears, it was announced last night.

Instead of racing to the South Pole, Harry and his companions will continue trekking to their destination over less dangerous terrain.

Announcing last night that the team was no longer racing, expedition director Ed Parker admitted that the terrain, weather and altitude – 8,000ft above sea-level – had got the better of everyone.

Called off: The Walking with the Wounded 208-mile race to the South Pole has been suspended for safety reasons

United: Prince Harry pictured on December 5 with a member of Team Commonwealth, Heath Jamieson, ahead of organisers calling off the race because conditions are 'far harder' than expected

Three teams of wounded service 
personnel from Britain, the USA and Australia and Canada were trying to 
race to the Pole to raise money for injured soldiers in a contest 
organised by the charity Walking with the Wounded.

Harry
 and his companions have endured temperatures as low as  -35C, as well 
as altitude sickness – which caused one of the guides to withdraw with 
breathing difficulties.

A spate of injuries have been caused by pulling 200lb sledges across a landscape of sharp ice ridges, each 3ft high.

Guide
 Eric Philips, who has been exploring polar landscapes for 25 years, had
 to pull out last week when water began seeping into his lungs. At the 
time he said he ‘felt terrible’ and couldn’t get any air’.

One group: The three teams will now arrive in the South Pole as one group rather than competing against each other to reach the finish line first

One
 of Harry’s companions, Sgt Duncan Slater, 34, said: ‘People have been 
suffering big time. Most people have got horrible dry, hacking coughs 
due to the weather.’

In
 a statement on the charity’s website last night, Ed Parker said: ‘It 
became obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the 
team members, the harsh reality of the Antarctic was starting to take 
its toll.

‘It was 
becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the
 team members, due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau.

‘With careful consultation from our doctor and the race team, we have put the race on hold.

‘The reason for this is entirely simple – safety, which remains the core principle of our expeditions.’

Inspiring: Every one of the prince's team-mates has lost at least one limb serving in Afghanistan

Parker’s
 decision was backed by Harry’s team leader, Guy Disney, who described 
the first four days of the trek as a ‘full-out slog’.

Many
 marchers suffered injuries that slowed them down until they fell behind
 the schedule set for the march. Disney insisted that morale remained 
high.

Today, Prince 
Harry and the teams, which also include the actors Dominic West and 
Alexander Skarsgard, will continue their trek along a different route to
 the Pole, with each team completing the 70 miles in its own time.

The course is expected to take the marchers around seven days.

Mr
 Parker added: ‘I strongly believe that by Friday or Saturday every 
member of the expedition will be standing on the South Pole, celebrating
 what will have been the most extraordinary journey.’

At the start line: It was uncertain whether the trip would ever begin after blizzards blighted initial preparation and left Harry and his team largely confined to their rooms
