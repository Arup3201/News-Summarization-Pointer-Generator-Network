Prince Charles rounded off his third day in the Middle East with a tour of the naval ship HMS Dauntless in Kuwait City this afternoon and a relaxed cup of tea with the Commanding Officer Adrian Fryer. 

Charles, who is on a six-day tour to the Gulf states, attended a sunset ceremony, dressed in his tropical whites bearing his rank of Admiral of the Fleet, on the British destroyer, which is currently on operation in the Gulf.  

The ship, commissioned in 2010, has been working with the US fleet in the region, as well as undertaking counter piracy and anti smuggling operations.

Charles watched as the ship's flag was symbolically lowered at the end of the day and inspected some of its 200-strong company.

The prince, who was himself in the Royal Navy for five years and rose to command a minesweeper, enthusiastically took a tour of the £1 billion vessel, described as the most advanced ship Britain has ever built.

Lieutenant Commander Mile Klidjian, second in command, said: 'The prince made a point of chatting to as many of the staff as possible, remembering the banter - which hasn't changed in 30 years- and wanting to know about what it was like to work on such a world class destroyer.

He continued: 'It was a huge honour to welcome him.'

Earlier today, Prince Charles saw a very different side of the Middle East as he flew into Kuwait to be met by pair of adorable flower girls.

Charles was all smiles as they handed him a posy at the private Amiri Terminal alongside the Gulf state's Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf.

Fleet: Outside the Amiri Terminal was a fleet of around 40 identical maroon Mercedes Benz cars

Charles was introduced to dozens of dignitaries in an official line-up, before standing for the British national anthem  and a brief inspection of a military guard.

The heir to the throne was then whisked out of the airport and into one of around 40 gleaming maroon Mercedes Benz cars waiting for him outside. 

With the Crown Prince, he then travelled on for a meeting with Kuwait's ruler, His Highness The Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Jabber Al Sabah, at the Bayan Palace. 

The Emir, who last met Charles during a state visit to the UK in 2012, appeared to be quite a fan of the Queen and solicitously asked about her health through his official interpreter.

'She is in remarkable form,' replied Charles, adding: 'My father will turn 94 and he has very good eyesight. He is still out shooting.'

His remark prompted approving laughter from the Emir, who looked even more delighted when Charles told him: 'They remember with great affection your visit in 2012 to the UK'.

Not so fast: Before he was driven away, he was introduced to local dignitaries at the airport

Greeting: He was met by Kuwaiti Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf at the private VIP terminal at the airport

Inspection: An honour guard of troops in red uniform were lined up in the arrivals hall to meet him

The Emir replied, with obvious pride: 'I will not forget the remarkable happiness and generosity of Her Majesty. I was living next door to her, I was her neighbour.'

By that point, Charles may have been forgiven for thinking the formalities were over but in accordance with Arab tradition, he was then ushered into a lavish lunch attended by 150 dignitaries, each of which he was required to greet and shake hands with.

Inside the dining room, the future king, a notoriously light eater who prefers to skip lunch, was offered dish after dish of fish and lobster delicacies. 

Impressed: Charles and his Kuwaiti counterpart inspected the troops before driving off in the convoy

Meeting: Charles met the Emir of Kuwait who asked him about the health of his mother, the Queen

Charles will stay overnight in Kuwait, a country he has visited on six previous occasions, before travelling onto the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

The prince is undertaking the tour at the request of the British Government, just a year after he last visited the region.

Sources said it is a sign of how important Arabia is to the UK and of how significant Charles's role is in fostering good relations.  

Saying goodbye: Charles' arrival in Kuwait came after he made a ceremonial departure from Jordan

Royal wave: Charles waved goodbye to his Jordanian hosts from the doorway of the jet

Honour guard: As Charles departed, so did his Jordanian honour guard

Warm words: Charles met with Jordan's King Abdullah during his trip to the Middle Eastern country

She's back! The Queen returns to London after quietly marking 63 years on the throne at Sandringham

The Queen returned to London today, after spending Christmas and all of January at her Norfolk home, Sandringham.

Resplendent in a lilac wool coat and, unusually, without one of her trademark hats, she was seen marching along the platform at King's Lynn station as she prepared to catch a train to the capital.

With her was her team of close protection officers and a lady in waiting, all of whom followed her onto the train.

The Queen traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham and usually marks the anniversary of her accession to the throne at the Norfolk property.

It was also at Sandringham that her father, George VI, died on the 6th February 1952. The Queen herself was in Kenya at the time.

The Queen, who also arrived at Sandringham by train, has spent much of her annual visit relaxing with the Duke of Edinburgh, although she has also made several official visits.

As well as attending a WI meeting, an annual tradition for the Queen, last Monday visited South Lynn Fire Station.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the 88-year-old monarch toured the engine bay and met local firemen before officially opening the new facility.

More of the same awaits on her return to Buckingham Palace this afternoon, with both the Queen and Prince Philip scheduled to complete a busy run of engagements between now and June's visit to Germany.

Elegant: The Queen, who last week celebrated her 63rd year on the throne, was resplendent in lilac

Staying safe: The train was cleaned before the Queen arrived, overseen by police officers

Protection: The train and the platform were also checked for explosives ahead of the Queen's arrival
