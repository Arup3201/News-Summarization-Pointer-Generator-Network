She is the multi-millionaire head of one of the country's most renowned food companies.

But Audrey Baxter, chief executive of 
Baxters food group, has now been banned from the road after admitting 
drink-driving on Christmas Eve.

The 50-year-old, one of Scotland's richest women, was caught over the limit after driving her sick partner to hospital.

Baxter had been attending a function before going home to prepare food and drinking two large glasses of wine.

She later discovered her partner's 
condition had deteriorated and drove him to hospital. When the couple 
arrived at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Moray, she parked her Range 
Rover over an ambulance bay.

Medical staff suspected she had been drinking and police were called.

Following a later breath test, Baxter was found to be more than one-and-a-half times the legal limit.

At Elgin Sheriff Court on Wednesday, the businesswoman admitted drink-driving.

Fiscal depute Shona Duncan told the court that Baxter had arrived at the hospital at around 9pm on December 24 last year.

She was asked to remove her 4x4 from 
the ambulance bay some 45 minutes after she arrived and was seen driving
away shortly afterwards.

When police went to the tycoon's Elgin
home, she admitted to police officers: 'I know I shouldn't have driven.
My husband is sick and I had to take him to the hospital.'

The court heard a breath test revealed Baxter had 58mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

Defence lawyer Diane Turner said that 
her client had attended a party for a short time a few hours before the 
incident and then returned home to prepare food for the next day.

Her partner had been feeling unwell and was asleep. She then had two large glasses of wine while cooking.

Miss Turner said: 'She went upstairs 
to check on her partner and she discovered he was very unwell and he did
require to go to the hospital.

'She was unable to obtain a taxi and simply put him in the car. She was extremely concerned.'

Her partner was eventually diagnosed with gastroenteritis and dehydration. Baxter was told to take him home and put him to bed.

Miss Turner said her client accepted full responsibility for her actions and apologised to the court on her behalf.

The loss of her driving licence would 
be a considerable inconvenience to Baxter because she travelled 
extensively, the court heard.

But Sheriff Susan Raeburn disqualified
the businesswoman from driving for a year and fined her £600. Baxter 
was given 14 days to make full payment.

The businesswoman's partner is 
believed to be Keith Bell, who was manager of The Foot Garden shoe shop 
in Elgin when the couple reportedly got together in 2002.

Baxters has become a household name by
producing soups, preserves, condiments, chutneys and other products for
more than 140 years.

Four generations of the family have been involved with the business, based in Fochabers, Moray.

According to the company's website, 
'each recipe is carefully developed with the  personal guidance of 
Audrey Baxter and our dedicated team of experienced chefs'.
