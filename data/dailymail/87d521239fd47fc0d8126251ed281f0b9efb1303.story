A sailor and his boyfriend have become the first ever male same-sex couple to share the ceremonial first kiss as they marked the homecoming of submarine warship USS San Francisco.

Thomas Sawicki arrived at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California on Monday to find his boyfriend Shawn Brier waiting to greet him as he returned to his home port.

The men, who had been chosen to share the first kiss, were photographed in their embrace.

'Everyone was cheering for me when they announced it over email,' Sawicki told NBC San Diego. 'Everyone was very excited, very supportive, very happy.'

The seven month stint in the Western Pacific had been Sawicki's first deployment, and when he returned, Brier didn't want eyes to be on them for the wrong reasons.

'I don't want to screw it up and fall in the water or something,' Brier told NBC before the kiss.

But he managed to stay on the dock and excitedly welcomed his partner back to the shore, as other families lined the port to welcome back their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers.

The USS San Francisco is the second oldest warship submarine in its fleet and in a few years it will be re-purposed as a training platform for newly recruited nuclear officers, NBC reported.

In 2005, the warship smashed into an underwater fountain, killing a sailor and injuring 97 sailors - and costing $134 million to repair it. 

The male same-sex kiss on Monday comes more than three years after the Navy marked a homecoming with a female same-sex kiss.

In December 2011, Petty Officer 2nd Class Marissa Gaeta of Placerville, California and her girlfriend Petty Officer 3rd Class Citlalic Snell of Los Angeles became the first ever same-sex couple in the Navy to mark the tradition.

Gaeta, in her Navy dress uniform, kissed her partner after 80 days at sea aboard the USS Oak Hill.

Their kiss came three months after 'don't ask, don't tell' was repealed.

Under the 18-year provision, gay people could serve in the Navy as long as they didn't openly acknowledge their sexual orientation.
