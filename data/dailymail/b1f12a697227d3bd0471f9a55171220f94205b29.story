Roberto Martinez has confirmed that John Stones injured his ankle ligaments during Everton's 2-1 defeat against Manchester United and will be assessed over the next 48 hours.

Stones, playing as centre-back for Martinez's side at Old Trafford, sustained the injury deep into injury time on Sunday.

It is unclear at this stage how long the England international will be sidelined for, but he will definitely miss the Three Lions Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia in the coming week.

Speaking during his post-match press conference, Martinez said: 'John Stones has a problem with his ankle. It will be at least a few weeks (until he recovers).

'It is such a massive blow because he plays with an incredible arrogance. We will assess him in the next 48 hours.' 

Stones made his first England start in a friendly against Norway on September 3, and five days later earned his first competitive cap for his country against Switzerland at St Jakob-Park in Basle.

The 20-year-old defender has played 25 times for Everton since his £3 million move from Barnsley in January 2013.

Everton confirmed Martinez's comments via their official Twitter account.
