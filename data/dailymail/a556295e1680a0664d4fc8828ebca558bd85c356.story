A Chinese man is suing the government for failing to halt air pollution, after he had to buy a treadmill to exercise indoors.

Li Guixin, from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province, claims the authorities have failed to control the increasing smog, which has forced him to spend money on face masks and an air purifier as well as the treadmill.

His lawsuit was filed as readings of PM2.5, a key measure of pollution, reached 444 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital of Beijing, nearly 18 times the safe level.

The smog in Beijing is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight, despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city's industrial plants.

Mr Li submitted his complaint to a district court, asking the Shijiazhuang Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau to ‘perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law’, the Yanzhao Metropolis Daily said.

He is also seeking compensation for local residents for the choking pollution that has engulfed Shijiazhuang, and much of northern China, this winter.

‘The reason that I'm proposing administrative compensation is to let every citizen see that amid this haze, we're the real victims,’ Li was quoted as saying by the newspaper.

It is unclear whether the court will accept Li's lawsuit.

Li said he had spent money on face 
masks, an air purifier and a treadmill to get indoor exercise last 
December when the pollution was particularly severe.

‘Besides
 the threat to our health, we've also suffered economic losses, and 
these losses should be borne by the government and the environmental 
departments because the government is the recipient of corporate taxes, 
it is a beneficiary,’ he said.

Northern China has in recent days been suffering its worst air pollution crisis in months.

Authorities
 have introduced countless orders and policies and made innumerable vows
 to clean up the environment but the problem only seems to get worse.

The government has invested in 
projects and empowered courts to mete out stiff penalties but 
enforcement has been patchy at the local level, where authorities often 
depend on the taxes paid by the polluting industries.

The National Meteorological Center has
 raised its smog alert for northern and central China, with heavy smog 
expected for another two days, state news agency Xinhua said.

The dangerous levels of smog had has drastic effects on the nation’s agricultural industry, it was reported today.

The polluted air is blocking out the sunlight, preventing photosynthesis and effectively choking plants and vegetables.

As a result, crops are struggling to survive in the smog, which could have disastrous consequences for China where agricultural production contribute to some ten per cent of GDP.

He Dongxian, an associate professor with China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, told South China Morning post that the country’s food production is under serious threat unless air pollution is not slowed down immediately,

Professor He conducted an experiment on chilli and tomato seeds, which would normally take about 20 days to grow into full-grown seedlings under artificial light in a laboratory, which saw it take more than two months for the seeds to sprout at a greenhouse farm in Beijing’s Changping district.

Beijing
 has been shrouded in stinking smog for more than a week and in an 
effort to cut pollution, 147 industrial companies in Beijing had cut or 
suspended production as of Tuesday, the Xinhua state news agency said.

‘Of
 course, on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale 
we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis,’ Bernhard 
Schwartlander, the World Health Organization's (WHO) representative in 
China said.

‘There's now clear evidence that, in the long term, high levels of air pollution can actually also cause lung cancer,’ he said.

Hebei,
 a major industrial region which surrounds Beijing, is home to some of 
the most polluted cities in China. Shijiazhuang routinely recorded 
‘beyond index’ measurements of particulate matter in early 2013.

The China Academy of Sciences identified the province as a major source of noxious smog that hung over Beijing a year ago.

The government said in an action plan 
for Hebei in September that it would ban new projects in certain 
industries, close outdated steel and cement facilities and slash coal 
use.

The province has 
promised to cut total steel capacity by 86 million tonnes, about 40 
percent of last year's production, by 2020. Official data suggests that 
is starting to happen.
