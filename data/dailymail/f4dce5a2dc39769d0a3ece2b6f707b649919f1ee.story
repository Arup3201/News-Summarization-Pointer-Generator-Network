The family of American photojournalist Luke Somers held captive in Yemen broke their silence Thursday, releasing a video to plead for mercy after US officials confirmed they had tried and failed to rescue him.

The brief YouTube clip featuring Somers’ brother, Jordan, and his mother, Paula Somers, came out just hours after al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate released their own video, threatening to kill the British-born journalist in three days' time unless the US government meets several demands.

Somers, 33, was captured on September 17, 2013, in Yemen's capital of Sana'a.

'Up to this point, we have no explanation as to why Luke was targeted as a victim, and we currently don't know why he's being held,' Jordan Somers says into the camera, directly addressing his brother's captors.

'Luke has spent the last two years making Yemen his home. He's a good person and he's only been trying to do good things for the Yemeni population.

'He goes out of his way to care for, and respects, the common person and he has made many lasting friends in Yemen.'

Jordan Somers then goes on to claim that their family were unaware of the failed special operations raid on a cave in Yemen intended to liberate Luke.

'Luke is only a photojournalist and he is not responsible for any actions the US government has taken,' he says. 'Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke, and we mean no harm to anyone.'

The hostage's mother, Paula Somers, then speaks, thanking the al Qaeda group for taking a good care of Luke and keeping him healthy.

'Please, show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our Luke again; he is all that we have,' she says into the camera.

'Luke, if you are able to hear or see us, please know that we're doing everything possible to help you. Our hearts are with you, we miss you and we love you, and all we want to do is see you again and have you safely in our arms, all together again,' the mother concludes.  

Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement Thursday that eight days ago, special forces raided a cave complex in Yemen to free a number of hostages. Some of the captives were rescued, but others, among them Somers, were not present at the targeted location.   

Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days 

White House spokesman Bernadette Meehan said the mission was coordinated with the Yemeni government and carried out by a group including both American special operations forces and Yemeni military.

'The overriding concern for Mr. Somers' safety and the safety of the U.S. forces who undertake these missions made it imperative that we not disclose information related to Mr. Somers' captivity and the attempted rescue,' Meehan said, adding that the White House's 'thoughts remain with the Somers family.

Meehan said the mission was being disclosed now because of the video released Thursday.

The video was released this morning by the Al Malahem Media Center, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's propaganda arm, and discovered by the SITE Intelligence Group which monitors terrorist activity online. 

Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times

The broadcast features Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, who is a senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Ansi warns President Obama that unless he accepts the terror group's demands, 'the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'. 

During the video, Ansi does not cover his face and is seen reading from a script in Arabic which accuses America of committing crimes against Muslims.

Ansi remains vague about what specific demands need to be met by the U.S. government to ensure Somers' release, but says the Americans are 'aware' of the list.

Unlike previous videos produced by ISIS and the Al Hayat Media Center, Mr Somers is not wearing an orange jump suit nor is he threatened with any form of weapon on screen. 

During the video, Mr Somers addresses the camera, saying: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.'

American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived

The video was released eight days after American commandos carried out a raid on an AQAP camp, in an attempt to rescue Mr Somers. The raid took place on a cave complex in the remote Hadhramaut province where locals give terrorist cells safe haven.

But by the time members of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, raided the AQAP camp on November 26, he had already been moved. However, the special forces recovered a group of eight hostages including six Yemenis, a Saudi Arabian and an Ethiopian.

One of the hostages rescued in the raid allegedly reported that Mr Somers may have been moved out with another group of prisoners two days before the raid took place. 

Mr Somers was believed to be a part of a group which included citizens from Britain, South Africa and Turkey. 

The New York Times reports that A Yemeni electricity company worker named Rasheed al-Habishi was also expected to be in Mr Somers' camp.

On Thursday, his son told the Times that his father's dead body had been found in a town near where the raid took place. 

The Pentagon initially asked members of the media not to report on the raid, for fear it would jeopardize Mr Somers' life, but the story leaked anyway.

It is understood that Mr Somers moved to Sana'a from London in 2010 to work as a teacher. However, he soon started taken photographs of anti-government protests in the city and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times. 

Mr Somers was kidnapped in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 by an Al Qaeda affiliate 

Mr Somers also worked as a translator and as a freelance photographer, with his pictures appearing on websites like the BBC.

The National Yemen newspaper published an article about Mr Somers this week, saying he was 'known as the most active photojournalist at Change Square' - a protest site at the center of Yemen's 2011 rebellion against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. 

However, not much else has been said about Mr Somers, especially about his life before moving to Yemen. The U.S. government tries not to publicize the kidnapping of citizens, in an attempt to shield them from hostage situations like this.  

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by ISIS, which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

ISIS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

And official figures suggest around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, while others have joined up with Kurdish groups to fight against the militants.

The government last month announced a raft of new anti-extremist measures, including ensuring insurance companies can no longer foot the bill for terrorist ransoms, suspected foreign fighters will be blocked from returning to the UK and powers will be reintroduced to relocate terror suspects across the country.
