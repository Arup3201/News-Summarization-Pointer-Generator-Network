A smartphone app that gives you the full lowdown on VIP airport lounges is available to download - for free.

Many lounges offer their facilities for a one-off fee, busting the myth that these have to be booked in advance when sorting your flights.

There are hundreds of lounges around the world that are there to be taken advantage of, and one San Francisco-based company's app, LoungeBuddy, can help you select the right one for you.

With delays, cancellations and missed connections a hardship felt by many, a bit of wining and dining in an airport lounge could prove to be the perfect solution.

Whether you’re looking for a comfortable spot to relax and have a cocktail, a work desk to be productive, a place to have a meal while enjoying views of the tarmac, or access to a shower after that long flight, a private oasis is now available to you.
