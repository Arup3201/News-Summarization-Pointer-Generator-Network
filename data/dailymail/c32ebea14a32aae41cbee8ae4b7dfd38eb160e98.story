A 13-year-old girl who had been missing from her home for more than two months has handed herself into police.

Just days ago there were reports that Jazmin Deacon - who disappeared from Blacktown on August 26 - had been spending her time with a much older man.

On Monday the teenager presented herself to officers at Blacktown Police Station, but would not reveal any details about the man she had been hiding with, The Daily Telegraph report.

Jazmin Deacon, 13, handed herself into police on Monday after she disappeared from her Blacktown home two months ago 

'She didn't tell us anything about him, I suppose she doesn't have to', Blacktown inspector Maureen Deagan told the publication, 

Ms Deagan added Jazmin came in following the recent media attention surrounding her case.

Until this week, she had not been seen or heard from for two months, when she disappeared from Blacktown.

But photos on her Facebook page that were published on September 29 showed her travelling with an older man at Kingswood, in Sydney's outer west.

Police said earlier this week they had serious concerns for Jazmin's safety given her age and suggestions she was with an older man.

Meantime, in the Hunter region, police are trying to track down another underage missing girl.

Police believe 16-year-old Taylor Almond is safe, but her family says her behaviour is completely out of character.
