All eyes, not to mention camera lenses, were trained on Luis Suarez as he emerged, carrying his boots, into the sunshine at the tidy red-and-white Arena de Jacare.

For Suarez, the World Cup finally seems set to start, 39 days after his last game, played alongside five Liverpool team-mates who will be opponents in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

This has been a familiar pre-tournament injury saga with a slight difference. Usually it is a key England player fighting for match-sharpness; this time it is Suarez, PFA Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, set to return for a clash that Uruguay and England dare not lose.

The big man is back, as Wayne Rooney once said of himself, and Suarez is anxious to help just as the South Americans are desperate to see him reunited up front with  Edinson Cavani.

‘Trust us,’ said Suarez when asked for a message to the people of  Uruguay, who hope this World Cup in Brazil will inspire their team as it did in 1950, when they emerged as champions, beating the hosts in the final.

‘We want to put things right,’ he added, reflecting on the 3-1 defeat by Costa Rica. ‘It is still in our hands to qualify. World Cup games are tough and can be decided in only a few minutes.

'You never know what can happen. It has been a hard few days since Costa Rica. The goals came at vital times and the result slightly flattered them. Stay calm. We’re going to give our best against England. We want to move forward as we did four years ago.’

It remains to be seen what condition Suarez is in for his first game after knee surgery. On Tuesday his movement did not look in any way limited as he twisted and turned, passed and dribbled in a few short and sharp training drills with Diego Forlan.

There was no strapping required to support the injured knee. Earlier this week he told the  Uruguayan press he would not have travelled to Brazil had he been  unable to play his part and that his treatment had been ‘fabulous’.

Another danger for England is that the Suarez circus, and the text  messages pinging back and forth with Liverpool players in England’s camp, has diverted attention from the rest of a strong team ranked seventh in the world.

They have a proud tournament record, despite being humbled by Costa Rica, but Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill did not see much to concern Hodgson when his side lost 1-0 in a friendly in Montevideo last month, when Forlan deputised for the injured Suarez.

‘We looked back at a lot of games and they are so heavily dependent on the front two,’ said O’Neill.

‘The rest of the team is solid and workmanlike, but they don’t have a midfielder who is particularly creative. There’s not a Pirlo in there.

‘The team plays deep and the front two sometimes get isolated. It is a very rigid 4-4-2. They go quite direct. It is not a typical South American game. Suarez and Cavani want the ball early. They didn’t get a lot of men forward against us. They don’t press like, say, Chile or Argentina.

‘At the back, Diego Lugano wants to play so deep that the team gets fractured. Uruguay see him as a mainstay and a leader. I think he is the one you can play on, with the pace England have.

‘If you look at the third goal against Costa Rica, Lugano should get across and he just doesn’t have the legs anymore.

'Neither of the central midfielders is a goal threat. They like to put their foot in, but they don’t get in the box.

They condense the pitch and rely on the front two. This could be the one time England go with two out-and-out strikers.’

Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez has warned there will be changes after the Costa Rica debacle and Jorge Fucile is expected to come in at right back for Maxi Pereira, who is banned.

O’Neill added: ‘That might suit Uruguay a little more because they will play with a defensive full back.’
