A 79-year-old mother will be kicked out of her £1.2million home - after a judge ruled that she cannot share it with the grown-up son she hates.

Elizabeth Ashley changed the locks on her home in Wandsworth, London in a bid to keep out her electrician son, Mitchim.

But Judge Diana Faber ruled she had 'unlawfully excluded' him from the house he had mostly paid for and which he half owned.

The judge considered splitting the house in half so that Mrs Ashley could live on the ground floor and her son above her.

But the breakdown of their relationship was so 'irretrievable' that forcing them to live in this way was bound to cause trouble, she said.

In the end, the only solution was to force Mrs Ashley to sell the home where she had lived for almost 40 years and split the profits with her son.

The enforced move was 'bound to lead to suffering' for Mrs Ashley, the court heard. But her tenacity in court showed she was 'well able to stand up for herself'.

With her son's help, she had bought the house under the 'right to buy' scheme in 2001 for just £250,000, making close to a 500 per cent profit since, the court heard.

And Judge Faber said she was sure the pensioner 'would be able to cope' with moving to 'a cheaper part of London'.

Mrs Ashley moved into the house as a council tenant in 1976 and only managed to buy it when her son, now in his 50s, agreed to put in £155,000 of his own money.

It had been his home since he was 14 but, in November 2012, his mother changed the locks and told him to stay away - even preventing him from collecting his belongings.

She insisted she had never agreed to a 50/50 ownership split and told Central London County Court: 'I don't want him there. Have I no rights as a person?

'After death yes, but during my life I don't want other people living there'.

Mrs Ashley even launched a counter-claim for damages against her son, accusing him and his wife, Lorraine, of targeting her with a 'phone call harassment' campaign.

But the judge said Mrs Ashley's central harassment allegation was 'probably concocted' because she was 'so angry' with her son.

He had made an 'unpleasant tactical attempt' to question his mother's mental health and was 'less than wholly reliable as a witness'.

But his mother had 'told the court substantially more untruths than he did' and her account of events had been 'thoroughly undermined', said the judge.

There was, she ruled, no truth in Mrs Ashley's claim that she did not agree to a 50/50 split or that she had been put under pressure to sign documents she did not understand.

She had 'exercised her free will' and had gained far more than her son from the spectacularly successful property investment, the court heard.

He had sold his own home to raise the £155,000 and his mother 'knew full well' that the intention from the outset was to provide a home for both for them.

The judge roundly rejected Mrs Ashley's claim that, for years, her son had only visited the house to collect his mail, walk the dog, and to 'bring women back'.

Although he moved to Hastings, East Sussex, in 2006, he had treated the Wandsworth property as his home right up until the day his mother changed the locks.

The judge said the only explanation for the unlawful 'lock out' of her son was that 'Mrs Ashley wanted the whole house for herself'.

He had told her he wanted to spend more time there, but 'she wanted to live in the house alone'.

Mr Ashley told the judge he had no desire to see his mother, who has nothing to live on but her pension, forced out of her home.

He only wanted to retrieve his possessions and to sleep in the house for part of the week whilst he was working in London.

Judge Faber said she had thought about a structural division of ground floor from first floor as a possible solution to the impasse.

But she was convinced that that was bound to lead to 'continuing disputes' between the warring mother and son.

She also considered allowing Mrs Ashley to stay in the house until she died, but ruled that that would hardly be fair on her son.

Such an 'irretrievable breakdown' in their relationship meant a sale of the house was the only realistic option.

The judge said the pensioner's conduct during the case revealed her as a woman 'well able to stand up for herself'.

She concluded: 'Although the loss of her long term home is bound to lead to suffering on Mrs Ashley's part, I am sure that she would be able to cope with the process of sale and of purchase of another property, even if it has to be in a cheaper part of London'.

The judge laid down a time table for estate agents to visit the house - as well as removers to retrieve Mr Ashley's furniture and other belongings - in preparation for a sale.
