Several pods of sperm whales emerged off the Southern California coast in an extremely rare, hours-long sighting that had whale watchers and scientists giddy with excitement.

More than 50 mothers and juveniles were rolling and playing with dolphins Monday a few miles off Laguna Beach, the Orange County Register reported.

'I've been counting whales and been on the water for 35 years. We've never had a large group like this ever,' said Alisa Schulman-Janiger, director of the ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project.

Unprecedented: Over 50 female and juvenile sperm whales appeared off the coast of Orange County, California on Monday in first ever sighting of its kind

Fascinating: The whales were spread out over an area of up to 3 square miles and came within inches of boats as they poked their heads out of the waves

The whales weigh up to 45 tons and eat about a ton of squid a day.

The massive mammals were spread out over an area of up to 3 square miles and came within inches of boats as they poked their heads out of the waves, said David Anderson, who operates Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari sightseeing tours.

Anderson said before Monday he had seen only one sperm whale in nearly 20 years on boats off Southern California.

'This was the most amazing sighting that I've ever had off Southern California, by a long shot,' he said.

By 5 p.m. the whale pods were passing the Dana Point Headlands and heading south. 

Frolicking: The whales were playing with pods off dolphins during the hours-long swim-by. When a sperm whale or two have been seen in the area in the past, they were there to hunt the depths for squid. These whales appeared to be having a good time

While a group of this size is totally without precedent in the area, individual sperm whales have been seen off Orange County before.

Some individuals have even continued to be spotted for years at a time.

A male sperm whale dubbed Double Scoop was first seen off Newport Beach in March 1984.

Double Scoop and another male sperm whale friend were seen off and on until 1990.

A male named Mango was seen in the Point Vicente and Redondo areas in 2011 and 2013.

Sperm whales mostly stick to warmer tropical or subtropical waters, but unusually warm waters off the Baja peninsula have brought with them species not usually seen.

'I’ve never seen anything like this,' said Schulman-Janiger. 'Nobody I know in Southern California has.'
