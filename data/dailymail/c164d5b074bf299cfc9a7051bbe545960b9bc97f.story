Scotland goes to the polls today as a final series of opinion polls last night suggested the future of the UK hangs in the balance.

Polling stations opened at 7am this morning and people have until 10pm to cast their ballot, with the result expected to be known by breakfast time tomorrow.

The crucial ballot, which could see the 307-year-old union between Scotland and England brought to an end, is expected to go down to the wire, with polls showing the contest is too close to call.  

After a frenetic final day of campaigning from the rival sides yesterday, the turnout is expected to be high, with 4,285,323 people registered to vote, according to the Electoral Commission, and for the first time 16 and 17-year-olds across the country will be able to take part.

With just hours until the historic referendum, a new poll has placed the No campaign in the lead with 51 per cent

A YouGov survey for The Sun and The Times and a separate poll by Panelbase both found 52per cent of Scots will to vote to stay in the union, with 48per cent favouring independence, when undecided voters are excluded.

If correct, almost all the undecideds – some 170,00 or so voters – would now have to break for Yes for independence to get the go ahead.

A Survation poll for the Daily Record, excluding the nine per cent who said they did not know how they would vote, put Yes on 47 per cent and No on 53 per cent. Last night’s polls confirmed that women remain more resistant to independence than men.

A blind pensioner was yesterday punched in the face for supporting a No vote as Scottish nationalists mounted a last-minute bullying campaign to intimidate people into voting for independence.

Thousands of police will today man polling stations as the separatists are expected to use menacing tactics to persuade people to break up the Union.

Last night it emerged the BBC had hired security guards to protect staff because of concerns that police may not be able to cope after the Corporation was targeted over alleged ‘bias’ last weekend.

As a poll found that 46 per cent of No voters had felt personally threatened by Yes supporters during the campaign, there were concerns about the possibility of mob violence in the event of a No vote.

A 75-year-old man, who is registered blind, was yesterday punched in the face by a nationalist supporter as he handed out leaflets in support of the Union in Glasgow. 

Incredibly, the YouGov poll found that Ed Miliband is now less trusted than David Cameron in Scotland, traditionally a Labour heartland, on 25 per cent against 26 per cent for the Prime Minister.

The tightest referendum poll left the No camp with just a two-point lead. The Ipsos MORI survey for STV put support for Yes on 49 per cent against 51 per cent for No, once undecided voters are excluded. 

Taking them into account, the No campaign is backed by 49 per cent, Yes on 47 per cent and ‘don’t knows’ on 5 per cent. The figures are rounded up. 

That represents a slump in support for the No campaign of five percentage points from August, while Yes is up seven points.

Turnout for the referendum is now likely to be extremely high, with 95 per cent claiming that they are certain to vote. 

While this figure is higher with those aged 55 and over who traditionally are more likely to turn out – 97 per cent – it is still very high across all age groups, including those aged 16 to 24, where 90 per cent claim they are certain to vote.

The record for any UK referendum was set by the 1998 vote in Northern Ireland, in which 81 per cent of voters took part.

Despite what could be a record turnout of a reported 95 per cent, the future of Scotland relies on undecided voters

In what has been praised as the speech of the No campaign, former prime minister Gordon Brown urged No voters to 'have confidence' and reject Scottish independence today. 

Speaking in Glasgow yesterday, a snippet from his esteemed oration: 

'What we created together, let no narrow nationalism split asunder.

‘Hold your head up high with dignity and pride – stand up and be counted.

 ‘Tell them Scotland does not belong to the SNP.

 'To those people that have still got doubts and are wavering, people who were thinking about voting Yes yesterday but could be persuaded today, let us tell them about the real risks.'

After proclaiming a premature victory lap, Alex Salmond received a hero's welcome as he spoke in Perth near Stirling yesterday for the last time in his Yes campaign. 

To the roars of a jubilant crowd, he urged them to 'seize the opportunity of a lifetime'. 

'We are the underdogs in this campaign, as we always have been.

'The Westminster establishment will fling the kitchen sink and half the living room and probably most of the bedroom at us. 

'They thought all they had to do was agree to it, see off Scotland, and then it wouldn't matter.

'This is our opportunity of a lifetime and we must seize it with both hands.'

It could even break the record for any UK-wide vote – the 84 per cent turnout in the 1950 general election.

Today's figures come after both sides said they were confident they would win earlier this week. 

Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Alex Salmond admitted to taking a 'premature victory lap' while Alistair Darling said he was 'confident' the No campaign would remain part of the UK. 

Thousands flooded Scotland's major cities yesterday on the final day of campaigning.

Crowds swelled in Glasgow's George Square which saw the heaviest police presence, while a planned march through the cobbled streets of Edinburgh led Yes voters to gathering at the Scottish Parliament.
