A four-month-old baby who had rickets suffered fatal brain damage after being shaken, a court heard today.

Rohan Wray, 22, and Chana Al-Alas, 19, of Islington, north London, appeared at the Old Bailey accused of murdering their son and causing or allowing his death.

Jayden Wray was taken off life support on July 24, 2009 and died the following day.

Jayden Wray, who died in 2009, was found to have 'moderately severe rickets' though a doctor believes that some of the injures to the four-month-old were non-accidental

Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'It is the Crown's case that those responsible for his death are his parents.

'Clinical investigation into the cause of his collapse revealed a number of injuries - some recent and others pre-dating his admission to hospital by quite some time.

'These injuries suggested to doctors treating him that Jayden had sustained them as a result of either a shaking or shaking/impact assault.'

Jayden had been born a normal baby when his mother was 16 and his father 19.

On July 22, 2009, he was admitted as an emergency to University College Hospital and placed on life support.

Within hours, Jayden's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.

Despite efforts to save his life, he was considered so severely brain damaged that his condition was 'incompatible with life', said Miss Howes.

The couple denied that Jayden had been injured in any way to their knowledge, but staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital found multiple fractures including to his arms, leg and skull.

He was severely brain-damaged and had haemorrhaging in his retinas.

On July 24, 2009, doctors decided to take the baby off life support.

Miss Howes told the court: 'It was explained that life support would be withdrawn but if Jayden stopped breathing, he would not be resuscitated.

'Rohan Wray asked the consultant paediatric intensivist Dr Shruti Agrawal how big the skull fracture was and if fractures could be dated.'

Jayden died the following day.

As part of tests carried out after Jayden's death, Professor Archibald Malcolm found that he had been suffering from rickets, a disease which causes bones to be weaker.

Miss Howes said: 'It was quite clear that Jayden, despite his healthy appearance to most of the health professionals who he saw, had moderately severe rickets.'

She added: 'It has to be borne in mind that Jayden had a greater risk of bone fracturing than any normal, well-nourished child.'

Prof Malcolm believed that, while many of the baby's fractures could be linked to rickets, some injuries were not.

He argued that fractures to the top of both of Jayden's humerus bones and his femur were more likely to have been caused by non-accidental injury, as was the skull fracture.

In his opinion the injuries were around seven to 14 days old.

He also noted haemorrhaging in the skull fracture, which he said could suggest a repeat injury before death, Miss Howes told the jury.

Wray and Al-Alas deny having caused any injury to their baby and the defence maintains that the seizures and fractures were linked to rickets.

Meningitis and encephalitis could also not be ruled out as possible causes of death.

The case continues.
