Inspiration: The late Jane Tomlinson competed in marathons despite having terminal cancer

She defied her doubters and became an inspiration when she achieved numerous feats of endurance despite suffering from terminal cancer.

Now Jane Tomlinson's husband has admitted even he was stunned when his wife announced she intended to run a marathon after she had been given just six months to live.

Mike Tomlinson shared his wife's inspiring story on the podcast Marathon Talk after announcing a new marathon will be staged in York in her memory this year.

The widower told presenters Martin Yelling and Tom Williams how his wife had never run before her cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2000 when she was only 36 years old.

But after being told she had only six months to live, she decided to take on the endurance challenge.

He said: 'It
was preposterous. She was told she was not going to see next spring and
there she was saying she was going to run the London Marathon in 
April.'

Mike added: 'She
did everything I thought wasn't possible for her. She was desperately 
ill with a lot of cancer in her bones. I never for a minute thought she 
could do it.

'But when she went out in the month before the marathon and 
did an 18 mile training run, I thought this is serious, she's really 
going to do it. She should have been dead and there she was on the start
line of the London Marathon.'

Jane went on to live for another seven years after her  advanced metastatic breast cancer diagnosis which Mike said was largely thanks to advances in cancer treatments. But he added he was certain taking up sport also helped prolong her life.

Not only did getting fit make her more 'robust' physically so she could better handle her grueling chemotherapy treatments, it also helped her mentally. The marathon gave Jane a chance to 'take control' at a time when she was 'losing everything', Mike explained. 'It meant cancer stopped defining her'.

The mother-of-three built up to running the London Marathon by taking part in 5k to half marathon races and after finishing the event in a respectable time of 4 hours and 53 minutes, decided she wouldn't stop there.

Remarkable: The mother-of-three went on to complete an Ironman and raise nearly £2m for charity

Pedal power: She also cycled across America to boost charity coffers

She went on to complete an Ironman (comprised of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run) and then a 4,200
mile bike Ride Across America, from San Francisco to New York.

Remarkably after completing the Ironman - an event that can break the fittest of athletes - Mike said Jane didn't need painkillers for a week as she was on such a high from her achievement.

'If someone has had a cancer diagnosis, 
they don't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give 
people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life'

He said: 'I expected her to wake up the next day and be a complete shell but she had no painkillers for a week.

'The endorphins she got from doing the race kept the pain at bay. That was the only week in seven years when she didn't take painkillers - after the Ironman.

'I'm not a medical man, I don't understand how the body works but there has to be something in that.'

Jane's achievements meant her whole family were thrust into the public eye and the Yorkshire man admitted they found this difficult to begin with. While many people were supportive of Jane, others criticised her for the challenges she was undertaking while ill and some even questioned whether she really had terminal cancer at all.

Legacy continues: Her husband Mike Tomlinson is helping to stage the Yorkshire Marathon in her memory

But Mike revealed while they would never have sought attention, when Jane's story first started making headlines, they decided to embrace it in order to make as much money for charity as they could. By the time of her death in 2007 at the age of 43, she had raised almost £2million for charity.

She also won numerous accolades including a CBE and inspired people around the world to change their lives through her example.

Mike said he hopes Jane's story continues to make a difference to people's lives.

'If someone has had a cancer diagnosis, they don't have to run a marathon but hopefully her story will give people some hope that diagnosis is not the end of your life, you can still have a fulfilling life,' he said.

Now Mike and his family are keeping Jane's legacy alive and continuing to raise money for good causes through staging various sporting events in the North.

Through Jane Tomlinson’s For All Events, they already stage the Leeds, York, Hull and Pennine-Lancashire 
10Ks, Leeds Half Marathon and walking and swimming festivals.

But now their jewel in the crown will be the Yorkshire Marathon which they hope will become a not-to-be-missed event in the UK sporting calendar.

The race, on a flat and scenic course around York city centre and surrounding countryside, will be held on Sunday, 20 October. Entries are now open and participants are encouraged to donate money to the Jane Tomlinson Appeal or raise money for a charity of their choice. However, there is no pressure to raise a certain amount in order to take part.

Do the impossible: Mike said on the day of the marathon, he hopes to see people 'achieve things they have never dreamed of like Jane did'

As well as raising money for charity, Mike hopes the race will make a difference to people's lives by encouraging them to get fit and enjoy taking part in sport. 

Mike and his daughter will also be running and he said he is looking forward to seeing people achieve what they thought might not be possible by completing the 26.2 mile course.

He added that the best part will be 'seeing people achieve things they have never dreamed of like Jane did - that's success.'
