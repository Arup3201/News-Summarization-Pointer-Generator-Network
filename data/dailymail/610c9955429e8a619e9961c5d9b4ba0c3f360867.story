Civil rights activist Diane Nash has said that she didn't participate in a march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama on Saturday because of former President George W. Bush. 

Nash revealed her reason to opt out of the Saturday event in an interview with NewsOne Now.

'I refused to march because George W. Bush marched and was in the photograph,' Nash said.

Nash later said in the interview she made the choice 'when it was apparent that he was going to be part of it. I think the Selma movement was about non-violence and peace and democracy.'

She continued, claiming 'And George Bush stands for just the opposite, for violence, and war, and stolen elections.'

NewsOne Now reported that Nash 'is widely considered the architect of many of King’s campaigns, and one of the only women in his inner circle.' Tessa Thompson played Nash in the 2014 film Selma, the website pointed out.

Nash was a leader in the Freedom Riders movement, having been one of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founders and the Nashville Student Movement Ride coordinator,PBS reported.

Nash recently told WLS that she and James Bevel, to whom she was married at the time, 'tried for several months to persuade Martin King and Andy Young, who was the executive director of [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] at the time, to go into Alabama on a voting project and we were not successful.

'It always seemed to be some type of thing that needed to be done right away. So Jim and I decided that he would take the car and some of his staff and start organizing. It was a big sacrifice for me because I was expecting a baby and had a toddler at the time.'

She told the television station that the pair couple drafted the first plan for the Selma voting rights movement after a 1963 church bombing which killed four children. 

Nash told WLS 'I never considered Dr. King my leader. I always considered myself at his side and I considered him at my side. I was going to do what the spirit told me to do. So If I had a leader, that was my leader.'

History: The events of 'Bloody Sunday' prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act. King is seen here at the March 26, 1965 march in Selma

On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared the work of the Civil Rights Movement advanced but unfinished  during a visit to the Alabama bridge that spawned a landmark voting law.

Obama, the first black U.S. president, said discrimination by law enforcement officers in Ferguson, Missouri, showed a lot of work needed to be done on race in America, but he warned it was wrong to suggest that progress had not been made.

'Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer,' Obama said, standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where police and state troopers beat and fired tear gas at peaceful marchers who were advocating against racial discrimination at the voting booth.

The event became known as 'Bloody Sunday' and prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

'The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office, but they led a nation,' Obama said.

'What they did here will reverberate through the ages ... because they proved that nonviolent change is possible.'

After his remarks, Obama and his wife Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, and mother-in-law Marian Robinson joined some of the original marchers along with former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, to walk across the bridge.

The marchers sang songs including 'We Shall Overcome' as a crowd of some 40,000 people looked on.

The anniversary comes at a time of renewed focus on racial disparities in the United States, including discrimination from police against black citizens nationwide.

Obama condemned the city of Ferguson on Friday for 'oppressive and abusive' actions against black residents that were revealed in a U.S. Justice Department report accusing police and court officials of racial bias.

On Saturday, he criticized efforts to limit voting rights that have sparked a clash between Republicans and Democrats across the country.

'Right now, in 2015, fifty years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote. As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed,' he said. 'Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence ... stands weakened.'

Rev. Raphael Warnock, the 45-year-old pastor of the Atlanta church led by King at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, lamented that the measure was now in limbo.

'I'm glad to see a parade of politicians here, but two years later we still are waiting on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act,' he said. 'You can't celebrate lessons of history from one period while standing on the wrong side of history today.'

Others reflected on how much had changed since the violence of a bygone era.

'Fifty years ago if we were standing here we would be surprised if a police officer did not beat us,' said Dick Gregory, 83, who was on the bridge 50 years before.
