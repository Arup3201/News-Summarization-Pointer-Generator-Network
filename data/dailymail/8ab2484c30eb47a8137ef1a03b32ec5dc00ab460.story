Timmy Donovan, who was wanted on a European Arrest Warrant over the death of Pc Neil Doyle, was held on suspicion of murder, Merseyside Police said.

The 30-year-old from Huyton in Merseyside was arrested by German police at Dusseldorf Airport trying to board a plane back to the UK.

Donovan, also known as Timmy O’Sullivan, was being sought over the killing of PC Doyle on December 19.

Pc Doyle, 36, was attacked during a Christmas night out with colleagues on Colquitt Street in Liverpool city centre. He was married in July and was due to go on his honeymoon this month.

Off-duty officers Michael Steventon and Robert Marshall were also attacked and treated in hospital for facial injuries.

Two men have already appeared at court accused of Pc Doyle’s murder and are due to go on trial at Liverpool Crown Court later this year. 

Christopher Spendlove, 30, of Stockbridge Village, and Andrew Taylor, 28, of Huyton, also face charges that they caused grievous bodily harm with intent.
