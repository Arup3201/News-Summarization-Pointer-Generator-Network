The Baltimore Ravens say they didn't write a script for Ray Rice and Janay Rice during their joint news conference on May 23.

In an interview this week on the 'Today' show, Janay Rice said the team suggested to her that she apologize for her involvement in the February incident in which Ray punched her in an elevator.

Janay Rice also said the Ravens gave the couple 'a general script' for the news conference.

Janay Rice told Today: 'I was ready to do anything that was going to help the situation. Help the way we looked in the media, help his image, help obviously his career. They told us earlier that week we would do the press conference, and I was fine with it.'

Denial: Despite what Janay Rice told Today, the Baltimore Ravens deny they ever asked her to apologize during her joint news conference with abusive husband Ray Rice in May

'I was basically ... not doing what I was told, but at the same time, I didn't think it was completely wrong for me to apologize because at the end of the day, I got arrested, too. So I did something wrong, too. Not taking any light off of what Ray did because I agree with everybody else. It was wrong.'

Kevin Byrne, Senior Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the Ravens, said in a statement Wednesday that the team provided talking points to Ray, but not Janay.

'At no time prior to the May 23 session did we provide talking points, a script or suggested script to Janay or speak with her about the press event,' Byrne wrote. 'We did not recommend or suggest to Ray or Janay that she apologize in any way.'

After Ray Rice told the Ravens he wanted Janay to speak to the media at the news conference, Byrne said he asked the running back 'on two different days if Ray wanted me to speak with Janay in advance of the press session. 

Both times, Ray declined and said: 'She's good. She knows what she wants to say.'

Janay Rice told Today that the Baltimore Ravens gave both her and Ray Rice a script and told her to apologize at their joint press conference

Meanwhile, Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president for football operations, conceded that the case involving Ray Rice was handled poorly.

'The commissioner (Roger Goodell) has acknowledged those mistakes,' Vincent told a packed hearing by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

'We failed. This is all part of our evaluation as we look at a new personal conduct policy ... But we learned from those mistakes.'

Representatives of the four major U.S. sports were on hand at the hearing on domestic abuse although none of the commissioners were present and only one of the top players' union officials, Michele Roberts of the National Basketball Association.

Domestic abuse has been a flashpoint issue ever since the NFL's handling of the Rice case, in which Goodell suspended the former Baltimore Ravens running back for twogames for knocking out his fiancée, who later became his wife.

Only when graphic video emerged showing him knocking out his then-fiancee did the Ravens release him and the NFL suspend him indefinitely.

Repealing the NFL's tax-exempt status and favorable anti-trust position was discussed by the senators should the league fail to implement an effective domestic abuse policy.

Kevin Byrne, Senior Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the Ravens, said in a statement Wednesday that the team provided talking points to Ray, but not Janay

'When young people see athletes committing acts of violence, and when those acts are excused, glossed over, and given pathetically weak punishments, they learn that domestic violence is not taken seriously,' said Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.

Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, said he knew of six NBA players who were charged with domestic violence recently but not sanctioned by the league because there were no convictions.

'The Commissioner (Adam Silver) has acknowledged that we need to do more in this issue in terms of discipline going forward,' said Kathleen Behrens, the NBA's executive vice president for social responsibility.

'Mostly in terms of due process and not really relying on the criminal justice system,' she added.

Vincent, who played in the NFL for 15 years, broke down when discussing his childhood.

'Domestic violence was a way of life in my home growing up,' he said. 'My brother and I watched helplessly numerous times as my mother was beaten and knocked unconscious while we dialed 911.'

'We saw how she struggled to seek help and find the courage to say 'no more'.'
