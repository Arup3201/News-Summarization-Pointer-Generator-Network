Appeal: Helen Curran lost her Patricia last Christmas at the hands of her daughter's ex

A mother is urging people in violent relationships to speak out this Christmas, a year after her daughter was killed by her ex while she was preparing the turkey.

Helen Curran’s 42-year-old daughter, Patricia, was stabbed five times by Clifford Burns, who also wounded his step-daughter, Megan, in the savage Christmas Eve attack at their home in New York.

Mrs Curran said: ‘I can’t wait for Christmas to be over. It holds nothing but painful memories for me. I urge anyone in an abusive relationship to get out. I wish my Trish had.’ 

In her first interview since her daughter’s death, Mrs Curran has revealed she had doubts about Burns almost as soon as he and mother-of-three Patricia got together in 1997.

‘Patricia told me Clifford’s dad had abused his mother for years, once shooting her in the chest,’ Mrs Curran explained. ‘Then he killed himself after kidnapping her. Clifford had only been a teenager at the time. I dreaded to think what impact it could’ve had on him psychologically.’

But Patricia did not listen to her mother’s warning. Instead they married, going on to have two children, Harley and Autumn, together.

‘Patricia told me everyone has good in them,’ Mrs Curran said. ‘Except I knew Clifford didn’t. He beat Patricia but she always went back to him. As a mother, that was unbearable.’

Finally, after one particularly brutal attack, Patricia found the strength to have a five-year restraining order taken out against Burns.

‘Patricia moved to a new place with the kids and got a job as a nurse at the local hospice. It was perfect for my caring daughter,’ Mrs Curran said.

But last year, Patricia confided in her mother that Burns had failed to pay child support.

‘I spoke to her on Christmas Eve and she sounded so much happier,’ she said. ‘We were all going over to her house for Christmas dinner and she told me she was popping out to get some last minute bits and couldn’t wait to see me.’

But that night, Mrs Curran was woken by her grandson Nicholas - Patricia’s eldest son - phoning with horrific news.

‘He was frantic and told me to turn on the television,’ she recalled. ‘I switched on the news and saw a photo of my smiling girl on the screen. The reporter said she’d been knifed at home and died in the ambulance. They also said Megan had gone to hospital with stab wounds. I couldn’t take it in.’

Megan (left) was with her mother Patricia (right) when the attack happened and suffered several stab wounds 

Helen and her husband Gerald rushed to their granddaughter’s side.

‘There were police everywhere and medics surrounded Megan,’ she said. ‘I heard one of them say that if the blade had hit her artery she’d be dead.’

The 73-year-old listened in horror as her granddaughter explained what had happened.

‘She said Clifford turned up while she, Patricia and Autumn were preparing Christmas dinner. He was wearing camouflage and had a knife. 

Helen was altered to the tragedy by her grandson Nicholas (with her left), and rushed with her husband Gerald (together right) to be with their injured grand-daughter at hospital 

‘She told me her mum was begging for her life. She tried to get in the way but Clifford stabbed her as well.’

Daughter Autumn, just 14, had seen the whole thing. She called the ambulance and put pressure on her mother’s wounds. But it was too late.

Burns was arrested following a high-speed car chase.

At Warren County Court, New York, US, he pleaded guilty to second degree-murder.

This Christmas the family will hold a remembrance for Patricia, pictured left and right

The court heard he had sent his 16-year-old daughter Harley a chilling text message which read: I have a special gift coming soon something for everyone to talk about and it will be hand delivered on foot not by car...

Clifford Burns, 46, was sentenced to 23 years to life and barred from contacting Megan, Harley or Autumn ever again. He is appealing.

‘I went along and glared at him straight in the eye,’ Mrs Curran said. ‘I don’t feel it’s long enough. I had to listen as Autumn’s hysterical call to the emergency services was played where she pleaded with her mummy to hold on. It was heartbreaking.

‘The children and I have been handed our own life sentence, one without a wonderful mum and daughter. Christmas will never be the same. This year we will be holding a remembrance for her.

‘If I can stop one other family going through what my Trish did then that will be a start. I knew Clifford Burns was rotten to the core the day I met him.

‘I just wish Trish had seen what I did – a monster.’
