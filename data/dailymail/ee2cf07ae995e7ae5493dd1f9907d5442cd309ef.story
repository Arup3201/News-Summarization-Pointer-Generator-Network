Frank Lampard's move to Man City raised a few eyebrows, but it’s been a move that has benefited both parties.

Aside from his equaliser against his old club, the deal has not really hampered Chelsea and it has certainly helped City.

Who wouldn’t want the greatest goalscoring midfielder in Premier League history in their squad?

After scoring at Southampton he now has 174 PL goals — one behind Thierry Henry. That is an incredible record.

He’ll say all the right things in public but make no mistake, Frank is a winner. He’d love nothing more than to help City beat Chelsea to the title.
