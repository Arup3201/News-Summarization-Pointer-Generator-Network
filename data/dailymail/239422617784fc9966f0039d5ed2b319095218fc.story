There is no better feeling than seeking out the perfect gift for your loved ones at Christmas. As one of the biggest UK High Street stores, Boots is the go-to place during the festive season for Christmas essentials - and the new Boots Christmas advert is set to reflect this in all its festive glory.

The new advert features multiple stories 
showing women, their friends and their families giving and receiving gifts and inspiring their loved ones to do things that make them feel good– from
getting back onto the dating scene to having their first shave.

For the first time Boots has cast real-life 
couples and relatives in the advert to capture their off-screen 
chemistry on camera, and the whole thing is set to the musical backdrop of Elton John’s number one hit Are You Ready For Love?.

Festive cheer: Boots' Christmas ad is sure to bring a smile to your face with the hilarious scene of a young girl painting her grandfather's toenails as he chuckles: 'Don't tell Grandma'

One scene shows a teenager receiving a shaver from his older brother as he says 'Let's sort this out big man' and strokes his facial hair.

Another hilarious scene shows a young girl painting her grandfather's toe nails hot pink as he chuckles and says: 'Let's not tell Grandma' while another child blow dries her dog's hair into a quiff and whispers 'Let's make you into a unicorn'.

On-screen chemistry: For the first time Boots has used real-life friends and families to help capture that chemistry

The montage of stories culminates with
the thought ‘let’s give gifts that keep on giving’ followed by ‘let’s 
feel good’ – a sentiment which will appear across all Boots UK 
communications moving forwards.

Elizabeth Fagan, Marketing 
Director of Boots UK said: 'It is four years since Boots UK 
launched its hugely popular "Here Come the Girls" adverts for Christmas 
2008 and the new advert represents another step forward for the brand, 
moving from demonstrating "Boots UK gets women" to actively inspiring 
them to feel good.

'The new communications strategy will see Boots UK 
inspiring women, and their families and friends from all across Britain 
to take active steps to feel good by being thoughtful and positive about
giving this Christmas.

Lots of laughs: Many scenes are laugh-out-loud moments and even feature a dog being transformed into a unicorn by its owner

Winter warmer: Taking a different approach from the iconic 'Here come the girls' advert, this year's offering will touch the hearts of families nationwide

'Our customers tell us that they want 
to give gifts that keep on giving "feel good moments" well into the next
year.

'We’re confident the buzz created by the advert, particularly via 
social media channels, will inspire the UK public to choose gifts that 
have a really positive impact on their loved one’s health and wellbeing -
in a way only Christmas gifts from Boots UK can.'

Experts at fashion news website fashionfreude.com said that this major Christmas campaign from Boots was a smart move in a competitive market.

'With John Lewis and M&S setting the trend with high profile family Christmas campaigns, leading chains can't really afford to miss the boat anymore.

'It's good to see Boots creating their own big festive campaign, and this year, in a move that echoes their incredibly successful Here Come The Girls advertisments, they have really opted for a fun, feel-good factor campaign rather than pulling on the heartstrings'

The full 60-second advert will air to the public for the first time this weekend during X Factor on Saturday night-which draws in an average audience of 7.8 million- with shorter spin-off adverts following during the run up to Christmas.

Behind the scenes footage will be available on the Boots UK Facebook page from later today.
