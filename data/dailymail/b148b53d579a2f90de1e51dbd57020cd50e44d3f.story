Doctors have battled against the clock to save an unborn baby who was given only 30 minutes to live in her mother's womb.

Medics in Norwich realised tiny Imogen Tooke was in trouble only when they carried out a routine scan.

They saw that the child had her umbilical wrapped twice around her neck and her heartbeat was plummeting.

Doctors then faced a race against time to deliver Imogen by an emergency operation before it was too late. Luckily, they managed to get the baby out with just minutes to spare.

Her relieved mother Melissa, 30, said: 'It is hard to believe that we were just 30 minutes away from losing Imogen.

'It's so lucky that the scan was carried out when it was. If it had been done just half an hour later then it would have been too late to save her.

'That scan saved her life. Luckily the doctors spotted that the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck and they were able to act fast.'

Miss Tooke, who works as a shop assistant, and her partner James Payne, 26, also a shop assistant, were thrilled when they discovered she was pregnant.

Her pregnancy went smoothly until 27 weeks when she developed swollen ankles.

Miss Tooke said: 'At first the doctor said it was due to the hot weather, but the problem persisted and then the midwife advised me to go to hospital for a check up.'

Doctors then discovered she was suffering from pre-eclampsia, a rare life-threatening condition and she spent the next four weeks in hospital. She had a scan every other day, and it was a scan at 32 weeks pregnant that revealed that her unborn baby was in danger.

Miss Tooke said: 'I'd had a scan two days previously so I was due for another one that day. I hadn't felt her move for a few hours and she wasn't being as lively as usual, but I hadn't thought it was anything to worry about.

'Luckily the scan was carried out first thing in the morning, just after 9am. If it had been done in the afternoon it would have been too late for Imogen.'

At the scan in August 2011, the doctors at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital discovered that the umbilical cord had become wrapped twice around the baby's neck.

She was rushed down to the operating theatre and put out under general anaesthetic, whilst doctors battled to save Imogen.

Miss Tooke said: 'The last thing I heard was that the baby was in trouble, and then chaos broke out. I was rushed down to the operating theatre and they had to give me a general anaesthetic to deliver my baby as there wasn't any time for anything else.'

'The next thing I knew was waking up a few hours later. My first thought was whether my baby had survived. Mum was by my bedside when I woke up and she told me that the baby was alive and well. It was such a massive relief.'

Miss Tooke was then wheeled down to see her tiny daughter, who weighed just 2Ib8, after being born eight weeks premature.

She said: 'I couldn't believe how tiny and fragile she was. Her skin was translucent and I could see every one of her tiny ribs.

'Her head fitted in the palm of my hand and I could even fit my ring around her leg, it was so small.

'None of the newborn clothes we had bought for her fitted, so mum had to rush out and buy some dolls clothes. They were the only things that would fit her. Mum even bought her one of the tiny t-shirts that people hang up in the back of their cars. It said 'Princess on Board' and it fitted her perfectly.'

After a month in hospital Imogen was allowed home, still only weighing a tiny 3Ibs.

Miss Tooke said: 'It was lovely to have her home, but I was terrified as she was still so small and fragile.'

Imogen has come in leaps and bounds and is now doing really well.

Miss Tooke added: 'It was a day that she may have never seen had it not been for the scan that saved her life.

'It is terrifying to think that if the scan had been just an hour later, then Imogen wouldn't be here with us today.

'She is the most fantastic baby, she's always so happy and smiling. Every day I look at her and know how lucky she has been. When she's older I will tell her about her amazing birth.'

Alistair McKelvey, Consultant Obstetrician, at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, said: 'We were very fortunate to find that at a scheduled fetal ultrasound, that baby Imogen was in distress and we had to perform an immediate caesarian delivery to save her.

'It is thankfully very unusual to encounter this situation at an ultrasound scan.'
