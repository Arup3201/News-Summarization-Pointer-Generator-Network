David Beckham and other members of Manchester United's famous 'Class of '92' squad are poised to front a £2billion takeover of the club, it has been claimed.

The takeover is believed to be funded by the oil-rich Qatari royal family and brokered by Beckham - who spent several months playing for Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain before retiring last season.

Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt are said to be in detailed talks to become the frontmen of a multi-billion consortium hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from Americans Joel and Avram Glazer, who purchased Manchester United in 2005.

The claims, made in The Sun today, have not been confirmed by the former players and a spokesman for the club said it had not received any bids.

Shares in Manchester United rose by $16.14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday amid speculation over the prospective takeover bid.

The club is currently valued at $2.6 billion, equal to £1.6 billion, despite having one of their worst seasons in living memory - including losing 3-0 to local rivals Manchester City on Tuesday.

The club's underachievement this season has seen players past and present complain publicly about the way the club is performing.

Following the defeat to Manchester City, striker Wayne Rooney admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to Old Trafford anymore because United are simply not good enough.

Rooney was left to reflect on another poor performance after admitting the team had lost their Old Trafford 'fear factor'.

The players involved in the alleged takeover bid were all members of Manchester United's 1992 youth team. They include Gary Neville (back row, second from left), Nicky Butt (back row, second from right), David Beckham (bottom row, second from left) and Paul Scholes (bottom row, second from right)

Many Manchester United fans have been unhappy with the ownership of the Glazer family since they purchased a controlling stake in the club for £810million in 2005.

The initial protests came as a result of the takeover itself, as the Glazers performed a highly leveraged buyout - effectively dumping £525million debt on the club overnight.

Manchester United's board had earlier branded the Glazer family's plans 'aggressive'.

Although they paid £270million from their own funds, the rest of the money used to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans - the majority of which were secured against the club's assets -  which have since incurred interest payments of more than £60million a year.

In the four years up to June 2009, when Manchester United last published their accounts - the club became liable to pay more than £325million in interest alone, not including interest not paid.

This increased the debt the Glazers loaded on to the club to about £700million.

Many supporters felt the Glazer family - who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers - had taken a great risk in their financial dealings.

Fans accused them of using Manchester United purely for financial gain and to remove debt from their US-business interests, adding that they had failed to understand the significance of owning one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the world. The Glazers have always denied this to be the case.

Unpopular: Supporter groups have taken to wearing green and gold in protest at Glazer ownership. The colours were originally worn by Newton Heath FC, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902

As a result of the anger, from 2009 supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold - the colours of Newton Heath FC - which was the original name for Manchester United.

The protest was seen as a way to remind the Glazers of the long history of the club and to remind them there was more at stake than money.

Green and gold scarves and hats have become a symbol of resistance against the Glazers ever since, and remain a common sight at the club's 76,000-seater stadium Old Trafford.

Troubled: The tactics used by David Moyes (pictured) have led to fan and even player unrest at United

Just over a week after describing 
their 3-0 defeat by arch-rivals Liverpool as one of the worst days he 
had ever had in football, the England international found himself trying
 to explain a similar scoreline at home to neighbours City.

The poor performance has led to rumours the club's owners may be happy to walk away.

'The Glazers have lost interest. Everyone knows the club is effectively up for sale,' a source told The Sun.

Middle Eastern bidders have reportedly approached the Glazers several times about a prospective takeover, with the only sticking point on each occasion being the price, the newspaper reported.

In 2010 the club were subject to a takeover bid 
from a local group dubbed the Red Knights, but they also failed because they couldn't meet the Glazers' asking price.

Earlier this week Paul Scholes gave credence to rumours of discontent at the club when he gave a scathing review of current manager David Moyes during an appearance on Sky Sports.

Despite saying the club needs to stick by Moyes, Scholes was highly critical of the current crop of players and the tactics being deployed in the post Sir Alex Ferguson-era.

Despite rumours that the 'Class of '92' players may be involved
 in the purchase of Manchester United, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs are 
also said to be close to purchasing Salford City FC.

In a move that may see the club renamed Salford 92 and Paul Scholes appointed manager, the club are believed to be aiming for Championship-level football within 15 years.

A
 spokesperson for Manchester United said: 'We haven't received any bids 
for the club. If we had we would have informed the New York Stock 
Exchange.'

Ryan Giggs, 40

Giggs was the first of the so-called Class of '92 to break into the Manchester United first team, and is the only member still playing professional football.

Now a player/coach under David Moyes at United - the club at which he has spent his entire career - Giggs signed a reported £80,000-a-week contract last year that will expire this summer.

With an estimated total wealth of £34million, Giggs is the co-owner of GG Hospitality - a hotel and restaurant management company which he set up with Gary Neville.

Gary Neville, 39

Neville retired from football in 2011 after making 400 appearances for Manchester United.

He joined Sky Sports at the start of the 2011–12 season, taking over as match analyst on Monday Night Football from Andy Gray to much acclaim.

A year after taking the job, Neville was appointed assistant manger to Roy Hodgson with the England national team.

Worth about £20million, Neville is understood to have a growing property portfolio alongside his business interests, which includes the aforementioned GG Hospitality business he set up with Ryan Giggs.

Phil Neville, 37

Gary Neville's younger brother Phil retired as captain of Everton at the end of last season.

Despite speculation he may join his brother in the coaching setup, Phil was appointed as Manchester United First Team Coach under David Moyes in time for the start of this season.

Phil Neville has raised over £20million for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where his daughter has been treated for her cerebral palsy.

Nicky Butt, 39

Although a dynamic defensive midfield player, Nicky Butt's post-playing career has been reasonably unremarkable.

Finishing his playing days in Hong Kong with South China FC, Butt took a year-long break before becoming a reserve team coach at Manchester United.

Nicky Butt is estimated to be worth around £14million.

Paul Scholes, 39

A true legend of the Manchester United midfield, Paul Scholes first retired in 2011 before returning a year later to help Sir Alex Ferguson to lift the Premier League title.

Retiring alongside the only manager he ever played under, 'shy' Scholes has made limited television and radio appearances as a pundit and is understood to be keen to get into coaching and eventually management.

If the Salford FC takeover goes ahead, Scholes is rumoured to become the team's manager.

David Beckham, 38

Without doubt the most high profile of the Class of '92, Beckham played for many of the world's biggest clubs - including AC Milan and Real Madrid - before finishing his playing career at Paris Saint-Germain.

Worth £165million - much of which has been accrued through endorsements - Beckham has been among the top earners at every club he has played for.

David Beckham's wife Victoria is a successful pop star and clothing designer in her own right, with the fashion company they co-own - Beckham Ventures Ltd - declaring a turnover of £15.4 million in 2012.

Earlier this year Beckham announced that he was a prominent stakeholder in a proposed £15million Miami MLS franchise - which would ensure he will be a major figure in US soccer for many years to come.
