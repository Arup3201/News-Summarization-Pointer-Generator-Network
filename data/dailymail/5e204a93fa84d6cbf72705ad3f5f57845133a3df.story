'On your gas mark 5, get set, go!' Great British Bake-Off judge Paul Hollywood will start the 2014 Bonhams London to Brighton veteran car run tomorrow.

Originally known as the Emancipation Run, it celebrates the day Parliament said motorists could drive without a man holding a red flag walking ahead of them.

The 1896 law change would be today's equivalent of abolishing speed cameras.

Hollywood will drive a two-seater 1904 De Dion-Bouton powered by a single-cylinder 6 bhp engine loaned by the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu — one of three vehicles it's entering.

He said: 'I've wanted to do the run ever since my grandad used to talk about it, so I'm really looking forward to it.' Also taking part are Transport Minister Robert Goodwill in his 1900 De Dion-Bouton, Pink Floyd drummer and motoring writer Nick Mason (pictured right), Olympians Sir Ben Ainslie and Sir Steve Redgrave and multiple world-championship wining F1 team boss Ross Brawn.

A feast of motoring from the pioneering days to modern times is planned for the tenth anniversary Regent Street Motor Show in the West End.

Cars there range from pioneering vehicles from the dawn of motoring to futuristic machines from today and tomorrow.

As well as hundreds of Brighton run cars, there'll be much that's bang up-to-date, such as pure electric cars from the likes of Tesla, BMW and Renault. Mini and Morgan will also be there, plus tributes to 50 years of the Ford Mustang as well as 40 of the Porsche 911 Turbo.

Dubbed a 'mile of automotive style', the event, which last year attracted more than 400,000 visitors, will see the shopping street closed to traffic from Piccadilly Circus to Oxford Circus for the day.

The show runs from 10:30am to 4pm. Details: regentstreetmotor show.com ? Skoda was named best manufacturer in the National Car Awards run by website weloveanycar.com. The Czech maker, part of the giant Volkswagen group, also won the most economical and best diesel categories.

Fiat sibling Abarth was named the industry's rising star, Honda the most reliable, Lexus the most comfortable, Subaru the most recommended and Maserati the greatest to drive — ahead of Porsche.

Ford's new Mondeo is not to be sneezed at, thanks to a new advanced air filtration system aimed at helping asthmatics and hay fever suffers.

The system blocks up to 99 per cent of pollen, almost all nitrogen dioxide — a key asthma trigger — plus other pollutants and odours.

As a result Ford says it will help stop allergy sufferers 'driving blind' after sneezing at the wheel. At 60 mph, a driver would travel up to 20 metres unsighted.

Hay fever affects more than a quarter of Europeans. Statistics show they are a third more likely to be involved in a collision.

Ford says the new system, developed in Germany, employs activated charcoal, as do gas masks, respirators, and spacesuits. It claims an improvement of up to 50 per cent on previous units.

German car giant BMW has teamed up with the Earl of March to help drivers brush up their skills.

The event, Ultimate Driving At Goodwood powered by BMW, promises participants the chance to hone their driving with the experts.

One test open to individuals and groups is a 32-mile off-road course that takes in the whole of the West Sussex estate, driving X5 (pictured) and X3 4x4s through forests, hillsides and chalk pits.

Performance puts you behind the wheel of BMW's M-power cars, including the M235i, M3, M4, M5 and M6 cars, plus the Alpina D3 Bi-Turbo, and includes one-to-one tuition by experts.

The courses, launched earlier this week, cost from £99 per person to master power-slides, to £620 for four hours on the performance circuit.
