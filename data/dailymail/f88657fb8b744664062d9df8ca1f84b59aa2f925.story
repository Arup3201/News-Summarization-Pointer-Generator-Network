Justin Bartha may have given his worst on-camera performance ever when he tried to play a pickup artist for NBA sideline reporter Jill Martin Sunday.

Martin tried interviewing the actor for a 'New York Minute' spot at the Kicks vs. Cavaliers game but her questions were deflected with flirty tangents that left her, and the audience, squirming. 

'Best picture: Did you have a favorite movie?' she asked.  

Actor Justin Bartha might feel embarrassed seeing the shameless way he tried to flirt with reporter Jill Martin

Bartha made a name for himself in the Hangover films alongside (left to right) Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms

'The Hangover' and 'National Treasure' actor immediately started teasing her about a crush on co-star Bradley Cooper. 

'You’ve gotta stop texting me about [Cooper],' he said.

Martin tried to laugh it off but Bartha kept going, telling her that a Hangover 4 wasn't in the works but maybe the pair of them could do something. 

'Maybe we can do something, like me and you, and we can get Bradley....' he said.

Keeping her calm, Martin answered back: 'I don’t know how this became about me, we wanted to talk about you,' she said.  

As the minute wound up, the camera mercifully cut away mid-talk.  

Bartha told Martin there wouldn't be a Hangover 4 but that 'maybe' they could do something together
