'Mastermind': Julian Ponder leaves the court in Denpasar, Bali, where he was today sentenced to six years in prison for drug possession

British antique dealer Julian Ponder, said to be the mastermind behind a £1.6 million cocaine smuggling plot, was sentenced to six years imprisonment by a Bali court today.

The sentence, at the end of a sensational series of trials that has seen a British grandmother given the death penalty, comes just days after Ponder bragged he would not be sentenced to death.

His punishment is regarded by police in Bali, where he was arrested last year, as a let-off – and has left 56-year-old convicted British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford the only member of a smuggling syndicate facing execution by firing squad.

‘We have always said Ponder was a 
major player in this syndicate,’ said a narcotics officer. ‘Because the 
Sandiford woman was the one actually caught with the drugs does not take
away the seriousness of others involved’.

Ponder, a 43-year-old former 
Brighton antique dealer, who has been cleared of smuggling but was 
charged with drug possession, was the last of the so-called British 
‘gang of four’ said to have plotted to bring 10.6lb of cocaine into the 
holiday island from Thailand.

Ponder was also fined one billion rupiah, around £65,000, by the court in Bali.

Two other Britons have 
received light sentences – Ponder’s lover Rachel Dougall, 38, has been 
sentenced to a year in jail for failing to report a drug crime, and 
40-year-old Paul Beales from Milton Keynes, has been sent to prison for 
four years for possession of marijuana.

Mrs Sandiford, who is 
understood to have made no profit from the drug smuggling operation when
she was arrested with the cocaine hidden in the lining of her suitcase 
last May, has accused Ponder, Miss Dougall and Beales of being the major
players.

‘I’ve become the scapegoat in
all this,’ the Cheltenham woman told narcotics squad officers as the 
investigation into the smuggling operation continued last year. ‘I 
cannot be made to pay for the more serious crimes of others.’

Through her co-operation in 
pointing an accusing finger at the others, prosecutors asked for a 
15-year-jail sentence and not mandatory death – but she was shocked when
last week a panel of judges ignored the prosecution request and 
sentenced her to execution.

The court accused Sandiford of damaging the image of the resort island.

Ponder and Miss Dougall lived
in a £1,000 a week palatial villa in Bali and because of their aloof 
behaviour and extravagant lifestyle villagers described them as the King
and Queen of Bali.

When Mrs Sandiford led police
to Ponder after her arrest, he told officers that he thought packages 
she had given him were sweets for his six-year-old daughter, Kitty.

Mrs Sandiford plans to launch an 
appeal against the death sentence, a process that is expected to take 
years as it drags through the courts, and she has also started action 
against the Foreign Office claiming it has failed to support her 
appeal.       

She is understood to have exhausted 
all her family’s finances and cannot afford a lawyer to fight the 
appeal, documents for which must be filed by February 12.

If she misses the deadline, the human rights charity Reprieve said she could still appeal for presidential clemency.

Verdict: Former antiques dealer Ponder leaves the temporary cell to make his way to the hearing at Denpasar district court in Bali today

The charity has engaged solicitors in 
Britain to file a judicial review on Mrs Sandiford’s behalf against the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Reprieve alleges the FCO has failed to
take all reasonable steps to ensure that Mrs Sandiford does not face 
the death penalty and does not suffer degrading treatment.

The charity also alleges that the FCO is in breach of its obligations to have ensured that Mrs Sandiford received a fair trial.

Ponder, cleared of smuggling but convicted of possessing 23g of cocaine, faced a maximum sentence of life in prison.

But
the prosecution asked the judges to impose a penalty of seven years - 
and then, in a reversal of the way the judges treated Mrs Sandiford, 
they reduced his sentence to six years.

So
he, like his partner Miss Dougall and Paul Beales, has got off lightly 
when at first all of them, including Mrs Sandiford, were facing the 
death penalty.

With time served and because of her good behaviour behind bars, Miss Dougall hopes to be back home in Britain before the summer.

Ponder can also expect to have up to a year taken off his six year sentence.

Paul Beales is likely to be released shortly after he has served three years of his sentence for marijuana possession.

That would leave only Mrs Sandiford behind bars, facing a bleak future of years of appeals and, even then, the grim prospect of being taken to waste ground and gunned down by a firing squad.

In her case, the prosecution had asked for her to be sent to jail for 15 years, but she, the police and lawyers were shocked when the judges handed down the death penalty.
