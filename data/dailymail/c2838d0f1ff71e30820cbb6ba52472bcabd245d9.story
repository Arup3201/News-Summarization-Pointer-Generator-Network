An Iowa woman delivered her own baby in the front passenger seat of a speeding van on the way to the hospital Friday, authorities say.

Jessika Thurman said she just had to 'open up my sweatpants and just scooped her out,' KCCI reports. 

Thurman woke up from a nap Friday afternoon with contractions, and less than 30 minutes later, she had delivered her daughter  in the front seat of a red van as her husband, Danny, frantically called 911 while trying to get Thurman to a hospital, according to KCCI.

Arielle Rose Thurman was born just before 4.30pm Friday, weighing seven pounds and one ounce.

ABC reports that the couple hoped to meet an ambulance as they rushed down an interstate toward a Des Moines hospital. 

In a 911 call, Thurman's husband is heard yelling 'she's out!' to the dispatcher as Thurman is heard yelling in the background.

'I just held her in my hands and just stared at her and I couldn't even say anything,' Thurman said. '

'I was completely speechless.'

Van: Thurman said she woke up from a nap with contractions so she and her husband, Danny, climbed into his work van (photographed) and began rushing toward Des Moines hospital 

The couple met the medics off of a nearby interstate exit and the family was taken to a hospital. 

Thurman described the unusual delivery as the best early Christmas present she could have asked for.

Thurman was due Monday, but she said that her baby 'was coming out and there was no stopping her.'

Just days after the shocking delivery, the couple is happy to hear that both Thurman and the baby are completely healthy.

'We got lucky,' Danny told KCCI. 

'[Arielle is] beautiful, and she made it, she's healthy. And so is my wife, she's good, so it all worked out.' 

In an interview just days after the incident, Thurman is seen holding her daughter, who is wearing a pink sweater and a white headband with flowers on it.

'She's perfect,' Thurman said.
