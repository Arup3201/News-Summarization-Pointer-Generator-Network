A mother whose son has permanent brain damage after doctors left her in labour for ten hours without noticing her baby was in danger, looks set to get a substantial payout after doctors admitted a string of errors.

Lisa Mainds was seen by six different consultants and midwives when she went into labour at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, but not one of them noticed her son was in distress.

By the time Findley, now three, was born his brain had been starved of oxygen for hours, leaving him with severe brain damage.

Devastated: Lisa and Stuart Mainds said they are 'heartbroken' after their son Findley was starved of oxygen at birth leaving him brain damaged

Life-changing: Mrs Mainds said her family's life has been turned upside down. She has been forced to give up work to become his full-time carer

He has since been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, needs help to walk, 
talk, sit up and drink and also suffers chronic kidney disease.

Findley was born by emergency C-section when doctors finally noticed he was in danger. 

Mrs Mainds, from Chesham in Buckinghamshire, told MailOnline: 'We are heartbroken. There were so many opportunities to spot the problem.

'We saw at least six different midwives and consultants but nobody saw the warning signs.

'They were just cruising around like they had all day.

'There was no urgency at all. By the time they noticed he was in distress it was too late.

'Having your first baby is supposed to be the happiest time of your life but I ended up crying my eyes out for weeks.

Delay: When Mrs Mainds was admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in August 2010, she and husband Stuart, right, had no reason to fear anything would go wrong. But medics failed to spot her unborn son's distress, waiting 10 hours before rushing her to theatre for a C-section

Brain damage: When Findley was born he was rushed to a specialist baby care unit at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. There doctors revealed he had suffered severe brain damage. He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and chronic kidney disease

'I am so, so angry. This didn't have to happen to my little boy. I can't ever forgive them for what they have done, even after the apology. They played God with my little boy's life.

'All the compensation money in the world means nothing to me, I'd do anything to turn back the clock.

'I feel as though Findley has missed out on a normal childhood.

'My son’s freedom in the future has been taken away from him because of this injury and mistakes.

Smiling through adversity: Mrs Mainds said her son, now three, is 'brave and smiley' despite all he faces

'He
 is now at an age when we can really see the contrast with other 
children and it is very upsetting when I see they way they interact with
 their parents in a way Findley and I can't.'

When the 33-year-old was admitted to the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire at 11.20am on August 19, 2010, she had no reason to believe anything would go wrong.

She was given a cardiotocograph (CTG), which measures the baby's heartbeat and the mother's contractions.

Medics told Mrs Mainds the results of the test were normal, indicating there was nothing to worry about.

But she and her mechanic husband Stuart, 40, had been given the wrong information, and since learned the test should have been flagged up as abnormal.

Three subsequent CTGs, revealed Findley's conditions was getting worse, but no one picked up on his distress.

Independent experts have said Findley should have been delivered no later than 2pm.

But it was 11.25pm before medics detected something was wrong and took the 32-year-old to theatre to deliver her son.

Findley was born at 12.27am on August 20, 2010 and rushed straight to a specialist intensive care unit at the John Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford.

There doctors diagnosed him with grade three Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) and permanent damage to both his kidneys.

Grade three HIE or global HIE, is the
 second most severe grading of brain damage, and means oxygen is 
prevented from reaching the brain after the blood flow is blocked. The 
condition can result in a person suffering a stroke or heart attack.

Admitted liability: Buckinghamshire NHS Trust, which runs Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, pictured, have admitted liability for Findley's brain damage and cerebral palsy. They have apologised to the family and paid a six-figure interim payment to help pay for his care

Mrs Mainds, who gave up her job working in an office to become her son's full-time carer, said Findley has to take 13 different types of medication on a daily basis and needs round-the-clock care.

She said had she known something was wrong she would have insisted doctors delivered her son earlier.

'Findley is so brave, and he's a smiley, happy little boy,' she said.

'It is just heartbreaking knowing everything he has gone through and will go through could have been avoided.

'I want Findley to have a normal life. I want us to be a normal family and not have to worry about having these constant medical appointments and additional worries but realistically this will not ever happen now.'

In October 2012, two years after Mr and Mrs Mainds took legal action, Buckinghamshire NHS Trust admitted that Findley's injuries would have been avoided if Mrs Mainds had received the correct standard of care during labour.

A spokesman for the trust told MailOnline: 'Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust is sincerely sorry for the shortcomings in the obstetric treatment that Mrs Mainds received and we have written to the family to apologise.

'The Trust has admitted liability for Findley’s brain damage, including his cerebral palsy.'

The hospital has paid a six-figure interim payment to the family and full compensation will be paid at a later date to fund the life-long treatment and care Findley will require.

The hospital has not admitted liability for Findley's chronic kidney disease, which could result in the youngster requiring a transplant.

Iona Meeres-Young, Clinical Negligence Lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'Within the context of labour – 10 hours is a significant timeframe in which the Trust had numerous opportunities to intervene.

'Findley now faces catastrophic injuries which were all entirely avoidable.

'Findley is still very young, but it is a relief to the family that the defendants have admitted liability – parties can now concentrate on assessing Findley’s disabilities and ensuring he has appropriate compensation to meet his needs.

'Lisa and Stuart have dedicated their entire lives to Findley who will require lifelong care and support.'
