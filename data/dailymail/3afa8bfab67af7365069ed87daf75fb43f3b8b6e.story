The photographer readily admits what he saw was so funny that he could hardly keep the camera still enough to capture this priceless moment.

Paul Goldstein, of Wimbledon, south-west London, took the hilarious photo at St Andrews Bay in South Georgia of two apparently headless penguins.

But the king penguins were only bending their heads back in the photo, captured on the British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean.

Heads down: Paul Goldstein took the hilarious photo at St Andrews Bay on the British overseas territory South Georgia of two apparently headless penguins

He said: ‘Initially I was just glad to be able to isolate a couple of these to photograph. It is so difficult normally as there are a quarter of a million others to clutter the background.  

‘As I prepared my camera I did a double take as one bent its head back to scratch in a position only the most fluid of gymnasts would ever embark on.’

The tour guide added: ‘Typically it had reverted to normal by the time I got the camera up but then it did it again, and its mate too.

‘I just managed to keep the camera still enough as I was laughing so much - to them it is a perfectly normal manoeuvre, but to me not so.’
