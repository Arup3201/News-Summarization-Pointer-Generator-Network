Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech looks set to stay at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season, after his agent admitted that a January move isn’t on the cards for his client.

But the second-choice stopper’s representative opened the door to a move to Barclays Premier League rivals Arsenal and Liverpool, saying Cech would be interested if they were to come in for him.

Czech Republic international Cech has been Chelsea No 1 for the past decade but found his starting place taken by returning loanee Thibaut Courtois for much of this season.

And despite talk that Cech is unhappy with his place on the bench, it now seems he won’t be moving when the transfer window opens next week.

‘It’s unlikely Petr will leave Chelsea in the January transfer window. The club and coach want to keep him to help win the title,’ his agent Viktor Kolar told Czech newspaper Sport.

But Kolar also admitted that staying in England is an option for the keeper. ‘I think Arsenal should have made an offer to him. I think Petr would be considering it,’ he said.

‘Liverpool need to strengthen their position in goal and they know Petr will be available in the summer. We’ve been in contact with Real Madrid but they don’t need a keeper just now. But we will discuss it again in March.’

Cech has started in Chelsea’s last three games, conceding just twice in wins over Sporting Lisbon, Hull City and Derby County, but has been dropped to the bench for the trip to Stoke as Courtois returns from a groin injury.
