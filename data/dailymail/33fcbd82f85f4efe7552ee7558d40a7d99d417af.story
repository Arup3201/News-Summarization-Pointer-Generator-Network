Faced with dropping e-reader sales, Barnes & Noble is going to split its retail and Nook Media businesses into two separate public companies as the firm fast realizes it is in a losing battle to Amazon's dominant Kindle.

Whether the Nook can be successful on its own remains to be seen. The e-reader posted $87.1 million in fourth quarter revenue, a 22% drop over the previous year.

Barnes & Noble has been trying 
to turn itself around as competition from discount stores and online 
retailers toughens, and as readers shift away from traditional books to 
digital formats.

The company spent years investing heavily in its
 Nook e-book reader and e-book library, but they struggled to be 
profitable

Nuked: Barnes & Noble on says it wants to split its retail bookstores and Nook media business into two separate public companies as it looks to boost shareholder value

Reality check: Barnes & Noble said on Wednesday that it planned to spin off its Nook business, once viewed as the companyÂ¿s best hope for surviving in an age of a dominant Amazon.com, as a separate public company

The bookseller's stock jumped more than 7 percent in Wednesday premarket trading.

The
 company's retail business includes its bookstores and BN.com 
businesses. Nook Media, in which Microsoft Corp. is an investor, houses 
the digital and college businesses of Barnes & Noble.

In December, Barnes & Noble said it was evaluating the 
future of its tablets, but it still offered a new non-tablet e-book 
reader during the holiday season.

The New York-based chain, which
 announced earlier this month that it was teaming with Samsung to 
develop Nook tablets, said that its board has approved the separation 
plans. It hopes to complete the separation by the end of 2015's first 
quarter.

Retail fail: Over the last two years, the retailer has brought in Microsoft and the publisher Pearson as minority investors in the Nook business, in part to help defray the costs of building and selling e-readers

Barnes & Noble Inc. also reported its fiscal 
fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $36.7 million, or 72 cents per share, 
from a loss of $114.8 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue for the period ended May 3 edged up to $1.32 billion from $1.28 
billion.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected a loss of 49 cents per share on revenue of $1.19 billion.

Looking
 ahead, the company anticipates that fiscal 2015 sales at bookstores and
 college stores open at least a year will decline in the low-single 
digits.

Shares of Barnes & Noble rose $1.50, or 7.3 percent, to $22.06 before the market open.

Barnes
 & Noble launched the first version of the Nook e-reader in 2009 to 
take on Amazon.com, Inc's market-leading Kindle and secure a place in 
the fast growing e-books market.

E-books
 now account for about 20 per cent of book sales, according to the 
Association of American Publishers. By Barnes & Noble's estimates, 
it has a 27 per cent share of the U.S. e-books market.
