The wife of Michael Schumacher claims the seven-times Formula One world champion is slowly improving after spending six months in a coma following head injuries sustained in a skiing accident.

Nearly four weeks ago Schumacher was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, where he had been cared for since the end of December, to the University Hospital in Lausanne closer to his home.

The 45-year-old is currently undergoing what was described at the time as 'a long phase of rehabilitation'.
