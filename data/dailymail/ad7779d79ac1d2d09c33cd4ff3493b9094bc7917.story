A 75-year-old patient has died after an ambulance taking her to hospital slipped off the road on suspected black ice and crashed into a deep dyke.

The woman was being taken to the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincs, when the vehicle crashed just before 3am today.

Lincolnshire Police said the ambulance left the A16 at Sibsey just three miles from the hospital. It was not using its blue lights or sirens when it crashed and was travelling at normal road speed.

Crash: The ambulance came off the A16 in Lincolnshire and dropped into a 15ft-high irrigation ditch

Recovery: The ambulance is lifted from the ditch running alongside the main Grimsby to Boston road

Tragedy: The vehicle tilted 45 degrees onto its side and wedged in the dyke above the water level

Officers are investigating if there 
was black ice on the main Grimsby to Boston road at the time of the 
accident. No other vehicle was involved in the crash and no arrests have
been made.

The pensioner died at the scene after the ambulance left the road and dropped into the 15 ft high irrigation ditch.

The
two-man crew of the ambulance were also treated for minor injuries 
after the vehicle tilted 45 degrees on to its side and wedged in the 
dyke above the water level.

Smash: The damaged vehicle is driven away from the scene of the crash on the back of a truck

Investigation: No other vehicles were involved in the crash and no arrests have been made

Police are investigating if the 
driver lost control on a right hand bend, close to the junction with 
High Ferry Lane, after slipping on black ice. Residents have also 
reported freezing rain falling in the area.

A sharp frost was not forecast in urban areas overnight, with temperatures falling to around three degrees Celsius in Boston.

But
it is thought temperatures may have dropped below freezing on the rural
stretch of road where the crash occurred, half a mile outside the 
village of Sibsey.

Hazard: Officers are investigating if there was black ice on the road

Aftermath: Tracks in the mud show where the ambulance careered off the road and into the ditch

Close-by: The ambulance was just five minutes from the hospital in Boston when it went into the ditch

The patient was being transported 
from her home in the resort of Sutton-on-Sea more than 25 miles way and 
was just five minutes from the hospital when the ambulance crashed.

Locals
described the corner as 'tricky' and said it was not unusual for 
drivers to be caught out on that stretch of road, which has fields on 
both side.

One Sibsey resident said: 'I would not 
quite say that road it is notorious but there are always a couple of 
cars that misjudge it and go off every year.

'If there was freezing rain or ice on the road in the middle of the night then it would be easy to do. It looks as though the ambulance's back end has just slipped off as they went around the corner.'

Another neighbour added: 'We heard all the noise about 3.30am and then when it got light we could see the ambulance in the ditch from our house. It is a wonder they were not all killed as it is such a deep ditch.

'It was also lucky that the ambulance did not go upside down in to the water, a lot of the ditches are a lot fuller than the one it went into.'

It is understood the alarm was raised by a passing motorist who spotted the ambulance. Police are appealing for other drivers in the area who may have seen the crash or were aware of the weather conditions at the time to come forward.

Ambulance service chief executive, Phil 
Milligan, said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to the family and 
friends of the patient who died following this tragic incident.'

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman confirmed: 'Police were called to the A16 Boston Road at Sibsey at 2.58am this morning after a report that an East Midlands Ambulance Service Ambulance had left the road near the junction with the B1184 High Ferry Lane.

'The two ambulance service staff, a 62-year-old man and a 52-year-old man, were taken to Boston Pilgrim Hospital and treated for minor injuries. A 75-year-old woman, who was a patient travelling in the ambulance, was pronounced dead at the scene.'

The ambulance has now been removed from the scene and the A16 is reopen. The dead woman is not expected to be named until tomorrow when a Home Office pathologist carries out a post mortem.

East Midlands Ambulance Service said 'As a police investigation is underway we are unable to comment.'
