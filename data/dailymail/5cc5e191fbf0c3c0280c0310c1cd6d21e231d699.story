It's good to know that, even in the animal world, mothers know to keep their young ones away from junk food.

This cheeky pup thought it was in for a snack when it found a cookie wrapper floating in the water at Moss Landing, California.

But its mother was soon on the scene and, perhaps worried that the cub was going to choke, managed to coax it away from the trash.

Photographer Michael Yang captured 
the sight of the youngster trying to nibble the packet last month.

He said: 'A baby sea otter pup got a hold of a plastic cookie wrapper and tried to eat it.

'Like a human baby that reaches for a nearby object and puts it in his or her mouth, it is a familiar and, perhaps, terrifying sight for any parent.

'After a couple of minutes of wrestling with the wrapper, the pup tucked the piece of plastic under its armpit as mom carried the pup away. Otters often hide food or rocks to use as tools there.

'I lost track of the wrapper, but 
when the pair returned a couple of minutes later, the plastic was gone 
and the pup was happily nursing from its mother and climbing on her 
head.'

Michael and local conservation groups are used to seeing the effect that man has on the local Californian sea otter population.

He explained: 'Most people that have seen these pictures experience a wide range of emotions - everything from sadness to anger.

'It is bad for any wildlife to get a hold of trash. It is even worse when it is baby wildlife. And in this particular case, it is compounded by the fact that the California sea otter is an endangered species.'

I still love you, mom: All is forgiven, as the otter gives his mother a hug... although it doesn't look very comfortable for her!
