‘The other day, a coach of a big team was knocked out of the Cup and he was saying, “Very good, now we can focus on other competitions”. If I lose against Bradford I won’t say that. I say, “It’s a disgrace” 

~ Jose Mourinho on Friday

Jose Mourinho slammed ‘disgraceful’ Chelsea after they crashed to a humiliating defeat against Bradford City, as four of the Premier League’s top six crashed out of the FA Cup.

The Blues boss admitted his side should be ‘ashamed’ after letting a 2-0 lead slip as they fell victim to a famous FA Cup giant-killing against the League One side.

Eight-time winners Tottenham Hotspur were turned over 2-1 at home by Leicester and Premier League high-flyers Southampton lost 3-2 to visitors Crystal Palace.

Premier League champions Manchester City were stunned 2-0 at home by Middlesbrough to complete an unbelievable day of FA Cup drama.

For Chelsea, the loss ends their hope of a quadruple and piles even more pressure on the club ahead of their Capital One Cup semi-final second-leg clash against Liverpool on Tuesday.

‘I feel ashamed, I think the players should feel exactly the same as I feel,’ said Mourinho. ‘I repeat the words I used yesterday in the press conference, if we lose, it is a disgrace. Is this one of my worst ever results? Yes. But this is the beauty of football, of the 

FA Cup. In not many sports is it possible that the best team and the best players lose against a team with complete different potential. This is the beauty of the FA Cup.

‘In the history of this competition, this happens to every team now and again, for me it is the first time, for Chelsea it doesn’t happen a lot and it is unacceptable to lose against a team from a lower league.

‘If I was a you (a journalist), I would be very critical with Chelsea, with the manager and players. But the other team don’t deserve that we forget them and we focus on the negative Chelsea. They also deserve such an impressive result. I could find in my bad feeling with the game and with the result space to be happy for them.’ 

Bradford boss Phil Parkinson was unsurprisingly in better spirits than his Premier League counterparts. 

Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson is congratulated by Mourinho having masterminded a shock win

Chelsea's £200million men were sunk by a supermarket shelf stacker who was plucked from non-league obscurity for the princely sum of £7,500.

James Hanson was the only member of the Bradford City squad at Stamford Bridge to have cost the club a fee when he joined the League One side from Guiseley in 2009.

The rest of Phil Parkinson's parade of heroes were stitched together by a mixture of free transfers and low-key loan deals.

In contrast the total cost of Jose Mourinho's shocked stars clanged the £200m mark.

Even £99m of talent on the bench alone could not rescue Mourinho from the most embarrassing moment of his managerial career as the Bantams proved worth their weight in gold.

The Bradford squad celebrate their famous FA Cup fourth round win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 

‘It has put Bradford on the map again,’ he said. ‘It’s only slightly sinking in. When we were on the pitch celebrating at the end it did feel a bit surreal, that we’ve come to the league leaders and scored four goals.

‘It’s a great feeling and will be remembered in Bradford for a long time but the rest of the country as well.’

Mourinho left key men Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa and Branislav Ivanovic out the squad, while Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and John Terry were on the bench.

But the Portuguese said: ‘The team I selected is a good team and the only player that came from the youth team is Andreas Christensen, he did well.

‘We didn’t lose because of Christensen. The kid did his job very well. The other players have to be ready to play for Chelsea, ready to play any game.

‘If they cannot play against a team from the Championship, League One or League Two, what do we do?

‘It is the same team that played against Watford in the last round and we won. The players that played — we are not speaking about a team of kids. I think the selection was good enough, more than good enough.’

Mourinho insisted Andre Schurrle’s omission from the match-day squad was down to a back injury.

The German has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge before the transfer deadline and his no-show  fuelled talk of an imminent switch.
