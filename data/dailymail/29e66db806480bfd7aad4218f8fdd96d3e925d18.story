Google is preparing to launch a 'superphone' and tablet codenamed X to take on the iPhone and iPad, it has been claimed.

Rumoured features include a bendable screen, ceramic case, and even gesture recognition.

It is expected to be the first 'real' Google Phone and tablet, as the firm has previously worked with other manufacturers, most recently LG and Samsung, for its Nexus range of handset and tablets.

Google is believed to be developing a 'superphone' through its Motorola offshoot that could take on the iPhone. Online rumours claim the 'Project X' handset could have a bendable screen, ceramic case and wireless charging

The 'Project X' handset and tablet are expected to compete with Apple's next generation iPhone.

Analysts believe the device, which could be called the iPhone 5S, will be announced in March, and go on sale in the summer.

It is believed the handset will have a faster processor and a new version of the firm's iOS software.

The firm hinted at its plans during its earnings call, when Google executives emphasized that when 
the company bought Motorola, Motorola already had a 12 to 18 month 
'product pipeline' in the works, which Google is still 'working 
through' - meaning the first true Google products are likely to arrive in the spring.

Rumors have already circulated that 
Google will reveal a Motorola-built 'X Phone' and 'X Tablet' at its next
developer’s conference, which is scheduled for May 15-17, 2013.

Although the firm has released no details of the new products, rumored features range from a bendable screen and a ceramic case to advanced gesture recognition technology.

In the call, Google CEO Larry Page said that 'In today’s multi screen world, the opportunities are endless… battery life is a huge issue… when you drop your phone it shouldn’t go splat.

'There’s a real potential to invent new and better experiences.”

Page also mentioned phone recharging as a pain point for people, leading some to believe the new products could include wireless charging capabilities.

Earlier rumours have also pointed to the handset having an extra-hard case that incorporates ceramic materials.

The comments came as the search firm announced better than expected results.

Revenue from Google Inc's core 
Internet business outpaced many analysts' expectations during the 
crucial holiday quarter and advertising rates fell less than in previous
periods, pushing its shares up more than 4 per cent.

The
world's largest Internet search company introduced new product listings
during the fourth quarter - typically its strongest - and also 
benefited from business growth in international markets, analysts said.

Excluding
traffic-acquisition costs, the business generated net revenue of $9.83 
billion, up from $8.13 billion a year earlier, Google reported on 
Tuesday. That surpassed a $9.6 billion average forecast from six 
analysts polled by Reuters.

'Business looked really strong, especially from a profitability perspective.

'They really grew their margins in the core business,' said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley Caris.

'Most of that strength seems to be coming from international markets which grew revenues quite substantially: up 23 per cent year over year, versus the 15 per cent growth in the third quarter.'

Shares of Google were up roughly 4.5 per cent at $734.46 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
