Nine babies found alive after a huge gas explosion destroyed a Mexican maternity hospital have undergone DNA tests in a bid to reunite them with their parents.

The newborn babies were  rescued from the collapsed building on the western edge of Mexico City after a devastating blast that killed a nurse and two infants.

Brave passers-by and emergency crews picked their way through the ruins of Cuajimalpa hospital before carrying the babies, which were just hours old, to safety.

Hospital bosses have now started the process of reuniting them with their parents as investigations continue into the explosion on Thursday.

The newborn babies were dramatically rescued from the collapsed building on the western edge of Mexico City after a devastating blast that killed a nurse and two infants

Hospital bosses have now started the process of reuniting them with their parents as investigations continue into the explosion on Thursday

A leak in a hose from a gas truck, which was fueling the hospital's tanks, was believed to have triggered the explosion, officials said

Officials say the babies did not have bracelets on when the blast demolished the building leaving dozens injured. 

Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said: 'We have nine DNA tests pending. There are parents who have identified their children, but as the babies did not have bracelets on, we have to follow a protocol to identify them.' 

Mancera said several babies survived because their mothers sheltered them with their own bodies during the blast.

A leak in a hose from a gas truck, which was fueling the hospital's tanks, was believed to have triggered the explosion, officials said.

Many areas of Mexico City have no mains gas supply and rely on deliveries from gas trucks. Mancera said the gas truck company involved had been working in Mexico City since 2007. 

Yesterday it emerged that the driver of the truck, which exploded while gas was being piped into the building, has been detained along with two assistants.

More than 70 people were injured in the blast, it has been reported.

A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said.

On Thursday officials said as many as seven had died but yesterday they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries

On Thursday, officials said as many as seven had died but yesterday they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries.

Armando Ahued, the city's health secretary said yesterday that 21 babies in all had been injured, and nine of those and seven adults were in serious condition after being rushed to other hospitals.

Several babies were found under the rubble while scores of rescue workers smashed through the concrete and twisted metal in a desperate bid for survivors.

The explosion occurred at 7:05 a.m. when a tanker truck was making a routine delivery of gas to the hospital kitchen and the gas started to leak. 

The blast is understood to have been caused by a leak in a hose carrying gas from the truck to the hospital

The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital

Dozens of people were evacuated after the truck exploded outside the hospital with many of the injuries caused by broken glass

Witnesses said the tanker workers struggled frantically for 15 or 20 minutes to repair the leak while a large cloud of gas formed.

'The hose broke. The two gas workers tried to stop it, but they were very nervous. They yelled for people to get out,' said Laura Diaz Pacheco, a laboratory technician.

'Everyone's initial reaction was to go inside, away from the gas,' she added. 'Maybe as many as 10 of us were able to get out ... The rest stayed inside.'

Workers on the truck yelled: 'Call the firefighters, call the firefighters!' said anesthesiologist Agustin Herrera.

People started to evacuate the hospital, and then came a devastating explosion that sent up an enormous fireball and plumes of dust and smoke.  

A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said

More than 70 people were injured including mothers who reportedly used their bodies to shield their children from the huge fireball

The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital and television images showed firefighters trying to extinguish fires throughout the collapsed hospital building. 

Herrera saw injured mothers walking out carrying babies. Officials said 110 people were inside the 35-bed hospital when the truck blew up.

'We avoided a much bigger tragedy because the oxygen tanks right beside (the area) didn't explode,' Herrera said.

The worst hit parts of the hospital were the neonatology, reception and emergency reception units, he said.

Passers-by rushed into the building after the blast and made their way to the nursery section, rescuing eight babies, it has been reported. 

Margarita Palma of Amexgas, a trade association of Mexico's propane distributors, said 80 percent of Mexicans use propane rather than natural gas delivered by mains. 

Some of the victims were airlifted to hospital as the scale of the explosion became clear

Liquified propane, which is highly explosive, is distributed to homes and businesses either by trucks like the one that exploded or in cylinders, she said.

Homes next to the hospital were also damaged in the blast, as windows broke and and shingles fell from roofs. Neighbors ran to help evacuate victims from the debris, local resident Carlos Soria Rezendiz said.

People seeking information on family members gathered around police lines that were set up to keep bystanders away from the chaotic scene.

Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter, and aerial footage showed firefighters scrambling over the skeletal wreckage of the building.

There were seven babies with serious injuries in intensive care in a nearby hospital, said Dr. Moises Zielanowski, as well as four adults in serious condition. Injuries included burns, fractures and bruises.

He said the hospital was working to identify six of the babies who arrived unaccompanied without identification.

Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said some of the injured were about to be released from area hospitals.

The gas truck driver and two other employees of the Express Nieto company were hospitalized but were in custody, Mancera said.

He said the company has provided gas to all the city's public hospitals since 2007.

The incident prompted tweets from President Enrique Pena Nieto to Pope Francis, who wrote, 'We are praying for the victims of the explosion in Cuajimalpa, Mexico.'

According to a government website, the hospital was founded in 1993. It is located in a densely populated lower middle class neighborhood next to a school.
