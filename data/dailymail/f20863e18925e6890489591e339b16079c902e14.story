It has been a lucky week for Mary Jane Hart. She started a new job and also won the lottery - twice.

For the Southeast Missouri mother, it must have felt like everything she touched was turning to gold, after she sold herself the second ticket, which won her $1 million.

Ms Hart, from Doniphan, had just started a job as a pharmacy technician when she had her first Powerball win of $500 on Wednesday last week.

Lucky streak: Mary Jane Hart won the lottery twice, including one win of $1 million

When she went to work at Hartland Pit Stop on Saturday, the part-time cashier sold herself a second ticket because the jackpot had reached a record amount.

Her winning formula came from picking the numbers of her favorite NASCAR drivers, and she plans on watching a lot more races now that she is a millionaire.

'I've always wanted to win a jackpot so that I could go to way more NASCAR races than I go to [now], which is a lot,' she told Kait8.

While the winner of the record Powerball jackpot of $590 million bought their ticket in Florida, Missouri was able to claim two $1 million winners in Saturday's historic draw.

In Zephyrhills, where the winning ticket was bought at a Publix supermarket, the town is waiting for the winner to come forward. The winner is believed to be a 26-year-old single mother.

The winner can choose to take the annuity or a lump sum of $370,896,780.54. The lottery withholds 25 percent in tax, but with no state tax in Florida, the winner could claim $278 million, according to ABC News.

Ms Hart did not bother to check her numbers until a friend told her one of the winning tickets had been bought at her place of work.

'Someone had called me and told me that 
there was a winning ticket [at Hartland Pit Stop],' she said. 'So I 
went to the convenience store at Poplar Bluff and it said I was a 
winner.'

The cashier had matched all of the numbers except for the powerball - winning herself $1 million.

'It couldn't happen to a better person,' Sara Barfield, who also works at the store, said. 'I'm glad to see it went to somebody deserving.'

But despite her winnings, Ms Hart says she will continue to work and will still play the lottery each week. '[My new boss] asked me I might be quitting, and I said no,' she said.

As well as some trips to watch Nascar racing, Ms Hart will use her winnings to help her son and pay for a trip to Hawaii.

'That's a lifelong dream,' she said. 'I think I can do that now.'

The estimated jackpot for the next Powerball draw is currently $40 million.
