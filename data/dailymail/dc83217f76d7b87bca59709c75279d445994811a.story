A grieving mother was left distraught when her best friend swiped £2,000 of her jewellery while she was planning her son's funeral in the next room.

Pamela Hill, 51, visited grieving Susan Driscoll at her home in Portmead, Swansea, when her son Paul, 39, died suddenly.

But while Mrs Driscoll was stood with a priest next to her son's coffin, Hill helped herself to the family's gold jewellery.

She was today jailed for 140 days having admitting theft.

Mrs Driscoll said: 'She is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room'.

Hill, who had been friends with Mrs Driscoll for more than 30 years, called on her at home to offer condolences following the shock death of her son, better known as Jakey.

Once Mrs Driscoll was distracted with the priest, making arrangements for Jakey's funeral, Hill bundled six gold rings and a bracelet worth £2,000 into a pillowcase and left with them.

She later sold the jewellery to a market trader for under £1,000.

Mrs Driscoll said: 'After losing contact for a year, Hill got in touch when she heard about Jakey. She did everything for me - she took me to register his death, and took me to the chapel of rest, and even offered to pay for the order of service.

Speaking of Hill, Mrs Driscoll said: 'She is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room'

Paul Driscoll, who was better known as Jakey, died suddenly at the age of 39

'We realised on the morning of Jakey's
 funeral the jewellery that things were missing. My son was lying in his
 coffin in the other room.

'She excused herself when the priest came to the house, and then left holding a pillow case with bedding from the spare room.

'What sort of person would do that?'

The
 family, who discovered the theft on the day of Jakey's funeral, said 
the experience, and the wait for the court appearance, meant that they 
had yet to be able to properly grieve for Jakey.

Left distraught: Susan Driscoll, pictured with her partner Paul Melville, was abused in court

Swansea Magistrates' Court heard how Hill admitted taking the jewellery and selling it, but had maintained she found the gold in a clear plastic bag, in a neighbour's garden when she had left the house.

Rachel Anthony, prosecuting, said the claim: 'Stretches the imagination somewhat.'

The court was also read a statement from a member of staff at the gold buyers, who said that when Hill had visited them, she 'seemed very nervous, and was looking around and wiping her face and her forehead'.

As District Judge Richard Williams began to sentence Hill, to 140 days imprisonment, a family member of Hill shouted expletives directed at Mrs Driscoll.

In a statement, Mrs Driscoll and partner Paul Melville, said: 'We are pleased with the verdict. If she had not stolen our jewellery she would not be in this position.

'She took advantage of us at our lowest ebb, and tainted the memory of our son, and caused us distress and pain. It is unforgivable.

'To be screamed at and threatened by a member of her family in court was unbelievable.

'We have done nothing - we are the victims, but we have the full support of police if there are further reprisals, and have had a lot of support from the community.'

Mrs Driscoll said: 'It had a terrible impact, I lost my son, and found out on the day of the funeral that someone had gone through my bedroom and stolen from us.

'I feel I have not been able to grieve for my son properly, and it was by a friend whom I thought was a very good friend.'

Describing some of Hill's evidence as 'risible' and 'unbelievable', District Judge Williams said: 'This was a particularly heartless and spiteful act.'
