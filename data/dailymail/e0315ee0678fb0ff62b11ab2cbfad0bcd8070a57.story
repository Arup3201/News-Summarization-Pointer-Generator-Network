Startled passengers on a New York train were left staring in disbelief at the sight of a man holding two enormous snakes during their evening commute. 

The unidentified man was seen casually handling the reptiles on the C train, according to a rattled eyewitness who took a couple of pictures on his phone.

Eric Hertzog, a 26-year-old KTU radio producer got on the uptown subway at Canal Street and saw the man 'playing' with the snakes.

Snake charmer: The unidentified man was seen casually handling the reptiles on the C train in New York whilst a brave woman sat beside him seemingly unfazed by the snakes in his hand

He told NBC 4 New York that the man had one python above his head which was hanging from a railing while another, around six feet long, sat between his legs.

And he revealed that one unlucky passenger was so preoccupied with his day that he nearly sat down beside the man without noticing the snakes.

But he soon realized his mistake and ran  to the other side of the subway car. 

Yet one brave woman appeared to be completely unfazed as she  calmly sat beside the man and browsed her e-reader during the hair-raising ride.

After three more stops, the man put the snakes into two bags and placed them in his backpack before he coolly got off the train at 14th Street station, according to Hertzog.

The stunned commuter posted two pictures of the bizarre incident on his Instagram account, on Monday, jokingly giving them the hashtags 'snakes on a subway' and 'sh*tgotreal.'

He wrote: '11pm subway. Dude just letting his snake chill like its nothing. #snakesonasubway #SamuelLJackson #nope. 

However, the snake charmer is in breach of the The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Transit Rules of Conduct under Section 1050.9(h)(1).

It prohibits riders from bringing animals (aside from service animals) onto trains unless they are enclosed in a container and carried in a manner which would 'not annoy other passengers'.
