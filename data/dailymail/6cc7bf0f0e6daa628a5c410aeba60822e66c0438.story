The heavily tattooed ex-convict who allegedly killed one and injured five during a shooting spree in the Phoenix area had bail set for $2million on Thursday.

Ryan Giroux, 41, silently bowed his head as a judge read out the lengthy list of charges including several counts of aggravated assault and burglary, along with one count of premeditated murder. 

Authorities say a motive for the initial shooting, which took place in a Mesa motel, is still unclear, though three later shootings were believed to be the result of Giroux's attempts to flee the scene.

Motive unclear: Authorities are unclear about why Ryan Giroux, 41, opened fire in a motel room, killing one and injuring three, before shooting three others while fleeing 

Records show that Giroux has a long rap sheet and history of substance abuse, while tattoos visible in prior booking photos identify him with membership of a white supremacist group.

Having served three state prison sentences since 1994 on various charges including robbery and assault charges, an undated photo from the Arizona Department of Corrections shows him with the words 'skin' and 'head' tattooed in place of his eyebrows.

The string of shootings began when Giroux opened fire into a motel room, where witnesses say Giroux had been arguing while accompanied by another, unidentified man.

A witness described hearing the man grab Giroux's shirt and tell him 'they needed to leave the area' after he fired on three people in the room, according to a document filed in the case. 

David James Williams, 29, was killed while his mother, Lydia Marie Nelson, 51, and Jessica Lee Burgess, 19, were struck and injured.

Giroux fled the motel, allegedly shooting Isaac Martinez, a 20-year-old culinary student at East Valley Institute of Technology, before stealing Martinez's car.

After arriving at an apartment nearby, Giroux reportedly entered and shot Donavon Worker, 24, before moving to another building and shooting Marcus Butler, 25.

After leading police on a manhunt for several hours, officers finally spotted him standing on a balcony at a vacant apartment and incapacitating him with a stun gun, before arresting him and escorting him to a truck parked outside the complex.

In his earlier arrest photo, Giroux also has the number 88 tattooed on his left temple, which a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group monitoring organization, described as shorthand for 'Heil Hitler.'

'Each of those 8s stand for the eighth letter of the alphabet, which is "H," which is "HH,"' Mark Potok told 12 News. 

On the other temple is the number 14, a reference to the 14-word phrase 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children,' coined by David Lane, according to the SPLC website. 

Giroux was known to be a member of Hammerskin Nation, a violent skinhead group, and an affiliate of the Aryan Brotherhood, according to Potok.

'We have learned by talking with a retired Mesa Police detective who we have known for quite a few years that Giroux was known to him way back in the 90s and early 2000s as a member of Hammerskin Nation,' Potok said.

In recent photos, tattoos on Giroux's eyebrows, temple and chin appear removed or faded. While on probation after his release from prison in 2013, officials noted Giroux's stated desire to distance himself from his past.

'The defendant stated he wants to change his life around and begin to have his facial tattoos removed as well as the tattoos on his hands,' probation authorities wrote in a report in May of last year. 

Giroux has served more than eight years in correctional facilities throughout Arizona prisons, which includes one aggravated assault conviction dating from a fight with Mesa police officers in 2007 as they arrested him for shoplifting a bag of potato chips.

Officers involved said Giroux went for a .45-caliber pistol tucked into his waistband, though the man denied it and claimed he was beaten.

Giroux spent two months for a probation violation after his 2013 release, with officials saying he failed a drug test and used or possessed methamphetamine and marijuana.

The report went on to state Giroux confessed to having violent tendencies when intoxicated or under the influence. 

According to a test the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department uses to screen offenders, there was a 'high risk' Giroux would re-offend.

Giroux has a GED and a certification in fighting wildfires. He also was using cocaine, heroin, LSD and methamphetamines off and on for the past 20 years, according to court records. 

Giroux is jailed on suspicion of murder and other crimes. His bond is set at $2 million bond.

He was arrested after officers spotted him on an apartment balcony and hit him with a stun gun. Numerous officers led the handcuffed man to a truck parked outside the apartment complex.

Giroux has served three stints in state prisons since 1994. An undated mug shot from the Arizona Department of Corrections shows him with several face and neck tattoos, including the word "skinhead" where his eyebrows normally would be.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said Giroux is not listed in their database. Spokesman Mark Potok said some of his tattoos, including an "88" tattoo on his left temple, are associated with white supremacy.

A newly released mug shot shows a bloodied and scraped up Giroux without many of his facial tattoos visible. Authorities say Giroux had expressed a desire last year to get his facial tattoos removed.
