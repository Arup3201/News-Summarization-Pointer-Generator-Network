Ben Foster has hit out at the ‘pathetic’ booing of club captain Chris Brunt from West Bromwich Albion supporters.

The Northern Ireland international was jeered as he left the pitch to be replaced by Sebastian Blanco during the 2-0 defeat to Everton.

Brunt became a scapegoat for fan ire as the team struggled to avoid relegation last season and it seems that lingering anger remains.

But England goalkeeper Foster is furious at the reaction from the stands to Brunt, who has played more than 250 games for the club over seven years.

‘It is absolutely ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club for such a long time gets that,’ said Foster.

‘He always gives his all and he’s somebody I would always have in the team. It’s not needed. It is really silly. It doesn’t help at all. It’s pathetic, to be honest.

‘Brunty is everything we’re about. He works his socks off. There’s no need to boo somebody.

‘If he very obviously wasn’t putting it in or couldn’t be bothered then fair enough, but that’s not the case.

‘If you’re getting ridiculed and abused like that it affects you and there’s no need for it.

‘Nobody likes that, I don’t care who you are, whether you’re the manager or the goalkeeper, centre-forward.

‘These are our supporters and we need our supporters to support us and not do things like that. It’s not nice.

‘You can understand frustration but it’s not like we’re not trying. If that happens fans are well within their rights to do whatever they like.

‘If they can see the club isn’t putting it in and the players aren’t working they can boo, but that’s not the case.'
