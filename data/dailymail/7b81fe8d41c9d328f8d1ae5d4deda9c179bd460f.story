A secret stash of aerial espionage photos of Britain taken by the Nazis and hidden at the end of the war have finally been published after they turned up in a charity shop.

The photos are the subject of a new book by historian and author Nigel Clarke of Lyme Regis, Dorset.

They were discovered in a secret archive of wartime reconnaissance pictures commissioned by the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

The photographs of Britain and Ireland were taken between 1939 and 1943 for target and intelligence purposes by the German air force the Luftwaffe.

Mr Clarke has spent years researching and collecting the images.

As the collection grew and more information was found out about the secret archive it was decided to put the pictures in a book.

Mr Clarke said: 'My initial interest was aroused by the discovery of a set of aerial images of Dorset towns taken by the Luftwaffe, which I discovered among a collection of old books in the corner of a local charity shop.

'This discovery led to hours of 
research and correspondence at home and abroad to locate new unpublished
 images. Many of the images in the collection came by a circuitous 
route.

'At the end of the 
war staff driver Phillips was attached to a General Horrocks and was 
sent with his car to await his arrival by plane at a recently captured 
Luftwaffe airfield.

'Staff driver Phillips decided to explore
 the subterranean bunkers of the aerodrome. In one of the rooms he found
 thousands of aerial photographs of Britain taken by the Luftwaffe.

'He carefully selected photographs he recognised of the West Country and took them as a war souvenir.

'After the war the photographs were left in a box behind the counter of his Equine supply shop in Exeter, Devon, where they gathered dust and were not discovered until after his death in 1992.

'It was this initial historic find that formed the basis for the archive.'

Adolf's British Holiday Snaps is in bookshops now.
