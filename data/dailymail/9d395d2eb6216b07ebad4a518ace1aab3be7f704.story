Probe: The man who handed himself in to authorities in Cyprus has facial similarities with reconstructions of how Ben may now look, the family said

The family of missing Ben Needham today insisted they remained ‘strong and resolute’ as they continued their search for him after a DNA test on a young man on Cyprus proved negative.

Ben's mother, Kerry Needham, and her family spent Ben's 24th birthday today waiting for results of tests on a young man featured in video footage shot in Cyprus that emerged this week.

But a post on the official Help Find Ben Needham Facebook page confirmed the DNA comparison analysis had not found a match.

The post said: ‘The Needham family have, in the last few minutes......had confirmation that the DNA results on the man in Cyprus have came back as negative.

'This, again, is more disappointment for Kerry and her family. However, they remain strong and resolute in their search for Ben, and there are other leads currently being looked into which keeps their hopes alive.’

Ben, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, went missing on the Greek island of Kos 22 years ago, when he was a toddler.

The man who handed himself in to authorities in Cyprus this week has facial similarities with reconstructions of how Ben may now look, the family said.

He came forward after a video emerged of him at a church in Limassol, on the island.

Ben vanished on July 24, 1991 after travelling to Kos with his mother and grandparents, Eddie and Christine, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of Iraklise.

Over the years there have been a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him.

Last year a major new police operation focused on a mound of earth and rubble close to where Ben was last seen but no trace of him was found.

Police in Cyprus had cast doubts over 
whether the young Roma man was actually the missing British boy after 
revealing his birthmarks did not match up.

A
spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'South Yorkshire Police 
have released the DNA of Ben Needham to the Cypriot authorities at their
request.

'The case of Ben 
Needham continues to be investigated by the Greek authorities and South 
Yorkshire Police continues to support his family.'

She said the family wanted to be left alone today, as they marked Ben's birthday.

According to TV reports, the 
man was co-operative with police but he is believed to have told 
officers he is Romanian and was visiting his girlfriend in Cyprus.

Ben's
mother Kerry has seen an image of the tall, blue-eyed man they had been testing, with light brown hair, wearing a blue and white striped rugby 
top.

She said her 'head was 
all over the place' and that the photo did bear a resemblance to Ben. 
There is also a video of the 22-year-old man, which has been viewed by 
authorities.

He has been living in Cyprus since February, and his parents live abroad, he said.

He
told police that he recognised himself in the video and photos after 
they were shown on Cypriot television news but was afraid to come forward 
because he didn't know why they were looking for him.

The
man came to the attention of the Greek police when he fled the mainland
with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service.

After seeing the image, Mrs Needham, 41, told the Sunday Mirror that she believed the man in the photograph could be Ben, who would now be aged 23.

She said: 'I’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how Ben might now look.

'As a family we’re greatly 
lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the Greek 
authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress.

'We’ve never given up hope of finding Ben and we are encouraged that the police in Greece are continuing to investigate.'

The image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the Lawyers Association in Kos.

Panayiotis
Avrithis, the president the association, realised the potentially 
explosive nature of the images and handed them to Alexandra Moussoura, 
the area's District Attorney.

The
video clip shows a man Greek sources say is between 20 and 25, with 
four other men from the Roma community, attending a church service in 
Limassol, Cyprus.

It was published with the photograph on Greek news site Zougla.

Despite a move by Greek police
to excavate land in Kos in a bid to uncover Ben's body, his mother 
has refused to believe that her son died after being taken.

Last
year, officers from South Yorkshire police travelled to the island to 
conduct their own land search, but no major new leads emerged.

The
case bears strong links to the tale of little 'Maria', the 
four-year-old blonde girl who was found living with Romas Greece this 
month, after allegedly being 'trafficked'.

It has since emerged that she is the daughter of a Bulgarian woman called Sasha Ruseva after DNA tests proved biological link.

Mrs
Ruseva, 35, claimed she handed her daughter over to a Roma family after
she gave birth in Greece and could not afford to register the new born.

But she and her husband Atanas, 37, could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold Maria for profit.

Regardless
of the conclusion, the evidence of Romas having acquired children who 
are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children
could have ended up in the impoverished communities.

Maria's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery.

Gerry and Kate McCann were alerted to the
case after Police in Portugal agreed to reopen their investigation into
missing Maddie.

Authorities in Ireland too, seized two
children from a Roma family to two test if they were living with their 
biological parents.

In
both cases, police suspected that the children, a seven-year-old girl 
from Dublin and two-year-old Iancu Munteau from Athlone, might be 
victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike
the rest of their immediate family.

Tests have since shown that both children were living with their real parents.
