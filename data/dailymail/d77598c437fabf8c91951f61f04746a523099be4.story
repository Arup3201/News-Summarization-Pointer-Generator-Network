A wife and mother said she believes in miracles after sewer workers found the $6,000 custom,made diamond wedding ring that she accidentally flushed down the toilet more than a year ago.

Mechelle Rieger accidentally flushed the gold band with seven diamonds down the toilet 18 months ago. Despite her husband Paul disassembling the latrine and going into the plumbing under the house, the ring was nowhere to be found.

She claimed the seven-diamond ring this morning at City Hall in Kuna, Idaho, bringing with her a photo and the March 2001 appraisal from the jeweller that made it, kboi2.com originally reported.

Lost and found: Mrs Rieger was able to claim the custom-made ring after bringing proof of ownership from the original jeweller

Mrs Rieger thanked city workers Travis Fleming and Carey Knight, who spotted the ring along with loose coins in a filtration basket while doing routine maintenance last week.

Mr Knight, who works alongside Mr Fleming as a sewer worker, told kboi.com that he originally thought the ring was a fake.

‘After I got it cleaned up, I could tell it was real,’ he said.

Mr Fleming added that the ring was the rarest find he’s seen in the sewers.

Upon broadcasting the report of the found ring, people from around the country called them and tried to convince the workers the ring was theirs.

‘We were getting calls from states all over – even one from Virginia,’ City Hall worker Chris Engles told kboi2.com.

Mrs Rieger, who was alerted by a friend, was frantic to get her ring back. She rushed to the jeweller in Boise where she had the ring custom-made and requested a certificate to prove ownership.

She says there was more screaming involved when she got a voice message from her friend relaying the news about a ring being found in the sewer in her old neighbourhood.

Mr Engles said the woman was all smiles when she arrived at City Hall to claim her band.

She took pictures with the two workers and thanked them sincerely.

But the story only gets better – Mrs Rieger got her ring back just in time, as she and her husband Paul will be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in June.

‘Miracles do happen, and I have my ring back,’ she told kboi2.com.

Lord of the ring: The band was sealed in a manilla envelope until she claimed it

The dramatic story started a year and a half ago when she was living in Kuna. She told KTVB.com that the ring bounced into the toilet after she flushed.

‘I just started screaming, and I had my hand down in there too.’

Her children, she said, didn’t see her cause for alarm. ‘My kids of course started laughing, because I’m kind of klutzy like that. I just started crying.’

She said that despite its murky year and a half in the sewers, ‘the diamonds are still sparkly as ever.’

Still, she said that she’s planning to get the ring cleaned professionally, and fix the band before she replaces her surrogate ring with the original. 

Finding the ring was made possible in part because Kuna has updated its sewer treatment in recent years.

According to kboi2.com, the city uses a filter basket that collects anything from cheap jewellery to loose change.

That basket can collect up to 90 per cent of debris, according to city workers.
