Lesbian women earn more than straight employees - but gay men are paid less, a study has found.

On average around the world, homosexual women are paid 12 per cent more than heterosexual counterparts - yet gay men get 9 per cent less than straight males.

Britain’s pay gap for lesbian women against others is 8 per cent, while gay men get 5 per cent less.

Split: On average globally, homosexual women are paid 12 per cent more than heterosexual counterparts - although they receive less in Greece and Australia

In the US, gay men earn 16 per cent less than heterosexuals - while lesbians get 20 per cent more than straight women.

Between the two lies Germany, where gay men earn 9 per cent less than straight men and gay women earn 11 per cent more.

The figures come in a report released yesterday into inequalities in the labour market which looked at gay and lesbian employees worldwide.

It was carried out by Dr Nick Drydakis, an economist at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, who said: ‘A puzzling issue is the earnings premiums found for lesbian employees in some countries.

By country: In the US, gay men earn 16 per cent less than straight men, while the figure is 5 per cent in Britain

‘Gay men often avoid certain male-dominated occupations in favour of female-dominated occupations - less masculine jobs - for which salaries may be lower.

‘The higher salaries among lesbians in some countries may reflect discrimination in favour of masculine traits rather than against them.

‘In addition, lesbians tend to self-select into male-dominated occupations that may offer higher salaries.’

He added: ‘There are no quantitative studies of the relationships among gender identity, personality characteristics and labour market prospects for lesbians.

‘So whether lesbian employees possess characteristics that enhance their attributes for job advancement and earnings is still unknown.’

Australia, Canada, the US and the EU are said to have the strongest protection of sexual-orientation rights, including workplace anti-discrimination laws.

Differences: The report found gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues (picture posed by models)

But the report claimed that despite this, all gay people are discriminated against in favour of heterosexual applicants with comparable skills and experience during the hiring process.

That was observed in studies carried out in Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Sweden, the US and Canada.

The report also found that gay and lesbian employees have lower job satisfaction than their heterosexual counterparts and are more likely to be harassed and bullied by colleagues.

But gay and lesbian people who are open about their sexual orientation within the workplace are more likely to report higher job satisfaction than those who are not.

The report highlights that not even 20 per cent of countries have adopted sexual orientation anti-discrimination laws in employment.

At the same time 2.7billion people live in countries where being gay or lesbian is a crime. The study was based on 10 surveys and commissioned by the World Bank/IZA World of Labor project.
