Eleven straight wins for Real Madrid and 17 league goals for Cristiano Ronaldo – the numbers are frightening and even more so when put alongside those of Liverpool who have only scored 13 league goals as a team so far this season.

Real Madrid ran out 4-0 winners over Granada and even by recent standards this was spectacular stuff with Ronaldo scoring the first goal after just 99 seconds.

The goal owed much to the tenacity of full-back Dani Carvajal and the precision of the pass from Karim Benzema, but also to Ronaldo’s own ruthless efficiency.

After Carvajal had dispossessed Jeison Murillo close to the byline and fed Benzema the Frenchman played in Ronaldo and, while lesser mortals might have struggled for accuracy so early in the match, the Portuguese thundered the ball first time past Roberto. The shot was practically Ronaldo’s first touch. Roberto’s first touch was to pick the ball out of his own net.

Ronaldo almost paid Carvajal back for his part in the goal with a back-heeled assist from the same byline from where the defender had played his part in the opening goal but Carvajal’s shot went high over Roberto’s bar. Madrid were again playing with their midfield quartet of pass-masters Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, James Rodriguez and Isco and again they had rivals Granada dizzy as they dominated possession. It is little wonder that some Real Madrid fans are wondering just who drops out when Gareth Bale returns.

The Welshman was left out of the squad but could be fit for Tuesday as Liverpool bring their dismal recent record to the Santiago Bernabeu. One player who is unlikely to be left out is  Rodriguez who scored the second goal on the half hour with a wonder volley from just inside the area.

Carvajal took a throw-in that Benzema flicked up to the 23-year-old. The French striker expected the Colombian midfielder to play the ball back to him but instead Madrid’s £60 million  summer signing just lashed it first time into Roberto’s top corner. It summed up Real’s current sky-high confidence and the whole Madrid bench were on their feet to applaud the flash of brilliance.

The only threat to Real was coming from themselves with Sergio Ramos and Pepe flying studs-first into each other as they tried to block a rare Granada attack. Carvajal then pulled up with an ankle problem and had to be replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa before the break. The change did little to affect the game but will be one fewer problem for Liverpool if he is out on Tuesday. Arbeloa does not carry quite the same threat going forward. 

Madrid made it three on 54 minutes and there was more Ronaldo brilliance although for once in the assist and not the finish – his back-heeled pass into space played Benzema through perfectly and he dispatched with ease past Roberto.

Granada came into the game more in the second half and Ramos had to block a Ruben Rochina shot. The ball came out to the same player but he fired over.

Iker Casillas was busier too and got down well to block a shot from Javi Marquez as Granada looked for a consolation goal.

But there were also chances at the other end with Marcelo hitting the bar and Benzema missing from close range and when the next goal did come it was Madrid’s.

Benzema played Arbeloa down the right and his cross was turned goalwards by Ronaldo. The ball may have trickled in anyway but Rodriguez made sure sliding it over the line for his second goal of the game.

Granada coach Joaquin Caparros had been furious before the game because he felt he had been misquoted saying ‘all I ask is that they don’t walk all over us’. He tore the offending Marca front page up in his pre-match press conference.

If it had been designed to inspire his players it failed. Madrid had walked all over Granada and torn them to pieces. Liverpool face a team in terrifying form.
