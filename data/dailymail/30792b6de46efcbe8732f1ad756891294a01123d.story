If you’re a fan of the ‘Croydon facelift’, it might be time to take a ‘hair holiday’.

Women who sport the look or use styling products such as heated rollers or straightening irons risk damaging their scalp and losing hair, say scientists.

The Croydon facelift, adopted by women including Katy Perry, Cheryl Cole, Tulisa and Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard, involves pulling the hair into such a tight ponytail that the face is stretched like it would be with surgery.

It is named after the hometown of supermodel Kate Moss, who popularised the style.

In other parts of the country the look has different names: in Essex it is known as the 'Dagenham facelift', in Northern Ireland the 'Millie facelift', and in other areas simply the 'council house facelift'.

But university researchers in America have warned that the style could be permanently damaging, and not only to the hair itself, but to the scalp too.

And so too could other female styling accessories, including hot rollers, straightening irons and chemical relaxers, used to unwind tight curly hair.

Dermatologists at the Southwestern Medical Center in the University of Texas have discovered that both the hairstyle and these modern hair accessories leads to hair loss from the root itself and chemical damage to the scalp.

And while these problems can sometimes 
be remedied with treatment, this specific type of hair loss - known as 
traction alopecia' - is often permanent and can lead to bald patches.

The study recommends 'hair holidays' where women take a regular day off from styling their hair to let it recover naturally from all the hot irons and rough treatment of previous days.

Tips to avoid damage include regular 
washing - as a buildup of oil is bad for the roots - and using 'natural 
hairstyles' that do not need heat treatment, because these place less 
tension on roots.

Research leader Dr Josephone 
Quintanilla-Dieck said: 'Pulling hair into tight ponytails or braids; 
using hot rollers, curling irons, or straightening irons; and applying 
chemical relaxers can all lead to structural damage of the hair shaft as
well as thermal and chemical damage to the skin of the scalp.

'Regular and sometimes even occasional use of these hair techniques may lead to hair breakage and hair loss from the root.

'Although usually reversible, hair loss occasionally can be permanent with longstanding or severe cases.'

Scraping the hair back into a Croydon facelift puts too much 'structural' pressure on the root of the hair, said the study.
