She is France's most famous dominatrix, has written several books on sexual submission, and now lives in a chateau in Normandy with a female submissive 31 years younger than her.

But for 50 years of marriage Catherine Robbe-Grillet, now 83, submitted herself to the sexual slavery of her husband, Alain, who drew up a contract for her setting out rules for kinky torture sessions.

Though she never signed the so-called Contract of Conjugal Prostitution, Catherine willingly participated in Alain's every fantasy, including being whipped, slapped, bitten, scratched, chained up and blindfolded.

The contract has now been translated and printed in Vanity Fair, and lays bare exactly what Catherine's demanding husband expected of his bride, with the promise of 20,000 francs (£4,500) if she obeyed.

According to the contract, which was drawn up in 1958, a year after the couple married in Paris, Catherine would have to present herself at a set time and place, dressed however Alain demanded, and willing to do whatever he asked of her.

The sessions, which could last for a maximum of two hours, were to be purely for his benefit. Catherine was expected to be obedient and willing to please, but nothing more.

Alain says he will allow her to take pleasure from whatever he is planning, but that all other emotions must be hidden except fear, pain and disgust, which she is allowed to show only for the briefest of moments.

Alain makes it clear that the various 'postures' he wants her in 'will nearly always be humiliating', she will be 'relentlessly' slapped and bitten for as long as he likes, though she may beg for mercy if it is hurting her too much.

Fame: Alain was a famous French film maker and novelist while Catherine also published books on sado-masochism under the pseudonym of Jeanne de Berg

Any marks left afterwards will be temporary, he says, and last only for a few hours. Catherine can also expect to be scratched 'preferably in the most sensitive areas' but can rest assured that her husband won't cause any 'conspicuous' bleeding.

The couple remained married until 2008, when Alain passed away. Catherine now lives in Normandy with a female submissive 31 years her junior

Alain may also use chains to hold Catherine's body in various degrading positions, and while they may uncomfortable or painful he expects her to hold them for as long as he likes, though again she may beg for release.

When she arrives and before she leaves Catherine must kneel in front of him to show his dominance, but otherwise she must 'remain exposed and open to him at all times' and ready to change position at the slightest command.

Finally, after he is finished with her, Alain says his wife will be dismissed 'without further ado' and that she must leave the room without speaking.

The erotic contract echoes the Mistress Contract, drawn up by an anonymous American couple 'She' and 'He', which laid out rules for an affair which started in 1981.

She would, she wrote, perform ‘mistress services’ for him, becoming his ‘sexual property’ and providing ‘companionship’ unless she was ‘indisposed or travelling’.

In return, like Alain and Catherine, She expected to be paid in return for becoming the sexual property of He.

Unlike She and He however, Alain and Catherine remained happily married until 2008 when Alain, who was also a film director and author, died.

During that time Catherine published several books on sado-masochism working under the pseudonym of Jeanne de Berg.

After her husband's death, she became involved with a 51-year-old woman from South Africa and the pair moved to Normandy, where Catherine took on the role of the dominant partner.

She still eagerly participates in sex session, and recently hosted a bizarre party in which four different scenarios were acted out involving a hotel, chambermaids a bellboy and several people playing hotel guests.
