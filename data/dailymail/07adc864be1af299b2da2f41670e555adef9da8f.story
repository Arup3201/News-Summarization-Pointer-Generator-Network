Italian authorities took control Tuesday of a cargo ship carrying hundreds of migrants after the crew disappeared and set it on a programmed route to crash into a coast, officials said.

The alarm was first raised about the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M after a passenger sent a distress call earlier Tuesday when the ship was off Greece. Greek authorities scrambled a navy frigate and helicopter, but the captain said the vessel wasn't in distress and didn't require assistance.

The ship then headed on its own toward Italy. As it neared Santa Maria di Leuca, on the southernmost tip of the 'heel' of boot-shaped Italy, Italian port authorities dispatched two helicopters as a precaution and boarded the ship with a team of six coast guard officials.

Coast guard spokesman Commander Filippo Marini said the team took control of the ship after determining there was no crew to be found. He said the Italians 'avoided disaster' by interrupting the programmed route that would have had the ship crash into shore.

He said the motor had been blocked, and that the Italian crew was trying to unblock it so that it could be safely brought into port.

Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees, most fleeing conflict or poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, attempt to reach the European Union each year, most heading by sea to Italy or Greece.

The smugglers who organize the trips often abandon the ships before they reach shore to avoid arrest.

The operation came two days after a Greek-operated ferry caught fire between Greece and Italy with the loss of at least 11 lives, prompting a two-day search and rescue effort. 

A merchant marine ministry official said the distress call had come from one of the passengers on board the ship, a man who had told emergency services 'we have no water, blankets, or food'.

This afternoon, BBC producer Piers Scholfield tweeted that a Greek frigate sent to aid Blue Sky M made contact, and was told the ship is 'not in danger, but needs food supplies'.

He also posted: 'Greek coastguard spokesman tells my colleague the ship Blue Sky M is now under Italian jurisdiction & no one on board is in danger.' 

Two military helicopters who flew over Blue Sky M this afternoon reported no sign of life onboard, according to Greek news website prothemanews.com 

The rescue operation is being coordinated by the Corfu harbour master. The Hellenic Navy frigate 'Navarino' and an S-70 Sikorsky helicopter have also been sent to the area

The incident comes two days after a Greek passenger ferry with more than 400 people on board caught fire in the same area, leading to a huge rescue operation by Italian and Greek coast guard and military officials. 

At least 10 people died in that incident, while more than 400 were rescued.

Authorities are still searching for potential missing passengers from the Norman Atlantic ferry.

The Greek frigate Navarino, which is heading to locate the cargo ship, had been in the area assisting in the rescue operation for the Norman Atlantic.
