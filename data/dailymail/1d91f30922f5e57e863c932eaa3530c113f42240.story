A Los Angeles-area elementary school teacher accused of taking bondage-style photos of students, some with cockroaches on their faces, and spoon-feeding students semen-laced cookies, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 23 counts of lewd acts on children.

Mark Berndt, 61, entered the not guilty pleas during a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court attended by parents from Miramonte Elementary School, where he taught for more than 30 years.

Berndt, the first of two teachers accused of molesting students at Miramonte, is being held on $23million bail - $1million for each charge and is due back in court next month.

All of the 23 initial victims were between the ages of seven and ten years old and 21 were girls, court prosecutors said.

In some of the pictures children were pictured with large, ‘live, Madagascar-type cockroaches’ on their faces, sheriff's officials say.

In others, students were seen with spoons of a substance later determined to be semen held to their faces.

Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt Dan Scott said today in court that the young students ‘didn’t realise they were victimised.

‘They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,’ he said,’ and were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar, (but) they did not realise the spoon contained semen.’

One alleged victim spoke out on the Dr Phil show last week. When Phil McGraw asked the young student what the cookie fed to her by Berndt was like, she said: ‘It had something like saliva, and it was slimy.’

Her face and identity were not revealed. 

Prosecutors say the allegations came to light after a photographer developing Berndt’s prints discovered lewd photos in January 2011. By law, commercial film developers are required to report child pornography.

The second Miramonte teacher, Martin Springer, 49, was charged earlier this month with three counts of lewd acts on a child and is free on $300,000 bail.

In the slammer: Mark Berndt, 61, was arrested this January

Berndt was arrested in January following a year-long investigation that began when photos showing blindfolded and gagged students were turned over to police by a drug store photo technician.

He had been a teacher at Miramonte for more than 30 years, and was beloved by many parents. He was arrested in January and charged with committing lewd acts on children as young as six years old.

The accusations have touched off protests by infuriated parents and prompted Los Angeles County school officials to replace the entire staff at Miramonte during an exhaustive investigation.

The shocking allegations of the two teachers brought into question how well students are protected by school systems.

NBC Los Angeles reports that Berndt was ordered to remain in custody until his next trial, to take place on March 28.

Shocking pictures released earlier this month shows the teacher and his letters to pupils at the centre of a disturbing alleged sex scandal that has led to the closure and reopening of a Los Angeles elementary school.

The photos show Mark Berndt dressed in black leggings and shorts. In one he is wearing Mickey Mouse ears and has his arm around a female student. Berndt appears to be eating a cookie of some sort, but it's unclear whether it was one of his own 'special' concoctions.

Authorities re-opened Miramonte earlier this month with an entirely new staff after it was closed down entirely when a second 
teacher was charged with sex abuse against students at the school.

In one physical-education class, 
first-graders reportedly had to tell their teacher where to find the 
class schedule and what they were supposed to be doing that period.

Parents and union leaders staged a 
protest outside, chanting 'no new teachers' and said the school board 
over-reacted by assigning every single member of staff to an unfinished 
high school nearby.

The teachers' union is set to file 
complaints on behalf of many of the staff, who do not yet know if they 
will ever be able to return to the school.

Some students wrote farewell letters 
to their former teachers. ‘You had to go because of somebody evil,’ one 
first-grader wrote. Others wrote: ‘You were a good teacher’ and ‘I will 
miss you.’

Parents were offered the option of 
transferring their children to another school.

District employees gave parents details about other schools in a two-mile radius
and charter schools.

‘It's kind of hard,’ said one parent, whose sixth-grader attends Miramonte. ‘You barely know your 
teacher, and they're gone. The kids don't know what's going on.’
