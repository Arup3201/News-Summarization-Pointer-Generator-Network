Top executives cursed a total of 254 times during analyst calls in the past decade, and their language was more laced with profanities during tough economic times, new research has found.

The CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. James Hagedorn, Ryanair Holdings Plc CEO Michael O-Leary and Merson Electric Co. CEO David Farr make up the Cursing Hall of Fame, according to a Bloomberg News review of thousands of CEO calls with investors and analysts from 2004 to last month.

The interesting, though perhaps not 
surprising, data shows bosses' cursing spiked in 2009, in the aftermath 
of the recession, and has been steadily declining as the recovery 
continues.

However, even Hagedorn called himself up
 on it recently, apologizing for his foul mouth during a discussion with
 analysts, showing the tide has turned.

'It swings back and forth,' Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts psychology professor Timothy Jay told Bloomberg.

The use of profanities goes up and down in the same way as gross domestic product and unemployment, the results show.

Profanity-laced: Bloomberg calculated that executives used the words f***, God***m, s*** and a**hole a total of 254 times in calls from 2004 to last month

Bloomberg calculated that executives used the words f***, God***m, s*** and a**hole a total of 254 times in calls from 2004 to last month.

The naughty words appeared 17, 34, 197 and 6 times, respectively.

Hagedorn, O'Leary and Farr are the only bosses to use the F word more than once - with O'Leary coming out on top with five occurrences.

'Speaking personally, I have no interest in f***ing dividends. I am very interested in getting the share price of this airline up,' O'Leary said on July 25, 2011, according to Bloomberg.

On a call on February 11, 2013, Farr said 'g**d***' three times, mainly to insist the firm was 'not a g**d*** one trick pony.'

And on February 14, 2012, Hagedorn said if you looked at the profit and loss 'it clearly was a s****y year' and also said 'I'm like "f***, Valentine's Day!"' during a story about forgetting the holiday.

But each of them have been trying to tame their tempers in the past year, their companies have said, with Hagedorn even getting a unanimously supported reprimand last year.
