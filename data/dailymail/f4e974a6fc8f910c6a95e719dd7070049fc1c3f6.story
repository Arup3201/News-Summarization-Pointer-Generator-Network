Looking dapper in a tiny tan pinstripe suit and orange shirt, a 2-year-old boy with only weeks to live served as the best man Saturday afternoon for his parents' Pennsylvania wedding.

Christine Swidorsky carried Logan Stevenson on her shoulder at the Saturday afternoon wedding in Jeannette, a suburb of Pittsburgh.

Logan stood with his grandmother, Debbie Stevenson, during a 12-minute ceremony uniting Logan's mother and his father, Sean Stevenson. The boy has leukemia and other complications.

‘We're married,’ Swidorsky exclaimed joyously after kissing her groom to applause from family and friends.

After a whirlwind week, the Jeannette couple tied the knot in a hastily arranged backyard ceremony that formalized their union and celebrated Logan's life, which doctors say will be cut short soon by cancer.

The Stevensons abandoned an original wedding date of July 2014 after learning from doctors late last month that their son had two to three weeks to live.

The couple wanted Logan to see them marry and to be part of family photos.

Logan, who was born Oct. 22, 2010, was diagnosed shortly after his first birthday with acute myeloid leukemia. He has Fanconi anemia, a rare disease that often leads to cancer.

He endured a stem cell transplant in July 2012. Last March, he underwent surgery to remove a kidney ravaged by a tumor.

During a Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World in June, Logan fell ill. He was hospitalized in Florida before he was flown back to Pittsburgh.

During a trip to the emergency room last month, a test revealed a mass in his remaining kidney, which led to his terminal prognosis.

Swidorsky's daughter, Isabella Johns, 
13, served as bridesmaid and the couple's one-year-old daughter, 
Savannah, was her parents' flower girl.

Logan is spending his remaining days at home, where he is showered with attention from family members.

'It hurts so bad because Logan is such a loving child... when I cry he wipes my tears away,' Swidorsky told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'Logan is a mama's boy.'

'His entire life has been nothing but hospitals,' Kellie Young, the toddler's aunt told the newspaper.

Last week doctors gave the little boy 
two to three weeks to live and told the devastated parents that 
continuing treatment would not be beneficial.

They told Swidorsky and Stevenson the best thing for Logan was to be at home with his parents, that he would be in less pain there.

'For such a small person, he has touched thousands of people,' Young said.

Logan's father said he felt happy he has had the chance to bring his son home from hospital and spend this time with him. But at the same time he said he felt helpless, knowing what lies ahead.

'It'll be the hardest thing I'll ever do is bury my son. You know it's coming, and you can't do anything about it,' he said.
