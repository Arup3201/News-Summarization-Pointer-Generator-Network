Three decades after he was beamed into our hearts, it seems E.T. may have returned - in the rings of a tree stump.

A hotel owner was chopping the tree down for firewood when he found the  alien's face afraid, alone and 3million light years from home on the Isle of Skye.

Awestruck Billy Harley immediately phoned home - to tell his wife to bring a camera.

'I put the chainsaw through a trunk and there was E.T. staring back at me,' he said. 'We're not quite sure what to do now. We could turn E.T. into a coffee table or a bar stool.'

Mr Harley is also considering naming a room after the 1982 film character at the Uig Hotel, which he runs with his wife.

Believe it or not, Mr Harley can't  claim Britain's first close encounter of the wooden kind.

Wiltshire pensioner Ken Dobson also found an E.T.-like swirl in a log in 2012 - telling reporters: 'We couldn't believe it! We've been cutting wood for years and we've never found anything like this.' 

It's E Tree! Billy Harley phoned home immediately after finding what he claimed was the screen alien's face in the rings of a tree stump

Likeness: The 1982 screen alien. 'I put the chainsaw through a trunk and there was E.T. staring back at me,' said the awestruck hotel owner

Rural: The tree was found near this isolated hotel on the Isle of Skye. If E.T. was trying to hide somewhere rural, he did a pretty good job of it
