A mother has died after she was attacked in the street in front of her two young children.

Nicola McKenzie, 37, suffered serious head injuries when she was beaten in Manchester's Moss Side district last Wednesday.

The diabetic - described as a devoted mother to daughter Teja, 12, and son Amahri, eight - was taken to hospital, where, two days later, medics turned off her life support machine.

Ms McKenzie's mother Veronica Fiddler, 62, a care worker, told how relatives and friends had been left heartbroken by her death.

She said: 'Nicola was quiet and lovely and kind. She was completely dedicated to her children. She hardly ever went out without them, they were her life.

'She was a very, very good mother and that is how everybody knew her. The children are going to miss her very greatly.'

Ms McKenzie was rushed to hospital after the attack and underwent emergency surgery, but died with her mother and father Erol McKenzie, 60, by her side. Post-mortem tests have shown she died as the result of a head injury.

Ms McKenzie and the two children were living with Ms Fiddler, who added: 'I got the call at work to tell me - it was a complete shock.

'Myself and her father were there by her bedside when they turned off the life support machine. The whole community is in shock, she was very well-known.'

Friends said Ms McKenzie lived for her children, Amahri and Teja Bryan (right), who witnessed the attack. Paying tribute to her this weekend, they said she was the 'best mum'

A man has been arrested in connection with her death and charged with assault, but it is understood prosecutors will now review the charge.

Oral David Bryan, 43, was charged with section 18 assault and appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Friday.

Detective chief Inspector Richard Eales, said: 'Sadly Nicola's injuries proved fatal and her family are clearly devastated.

'I would like to extend my condolences to Nicola's family at what is a very traumatic and difficult time for them.

'We have charged one man in connection with this incident and now, following her death, will be reviewing the charges against him in consultation with the CPS.'

The attack happened in residential Cadogan Street in Manchester at around 4pm last Wednesday
