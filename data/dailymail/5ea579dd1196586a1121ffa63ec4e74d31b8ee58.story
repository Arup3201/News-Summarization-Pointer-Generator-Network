The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Australian tour earlier this year cost Australian taxpayers a fraction of what it cost for the Queen to visit in 2011.

Kate, William and Prince George's whirlwind 10-day trip around the country cost a total of $474,137 excluding security – less than one fifth of the $2,688,819 it cost for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh to make a similar trip.

The majority of the money spent by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet ($251,338) was to cover transport costs, including for the RAAF to fly them from New Zealand to Australia and then interstate once they arrived, The Australian reported.

The next biggest cost was the royals' media liaison team at $85,366. Meals, accommodation and other incidentals cost $72,638, hospitality and events cost $59,486 and miscellaneous costs amounted to $4,309.

Transport (ground, air, water) - $251,338

Domestic travel (meals, accommodation, incidentals) - $73,638

Media liaison (including photographic - other costs) - $85.366

Hospitality and event-related costs - $59,486

Miscellaneous visit costs - $4,309

Total - $474,137

The figures do not include the cost of security, which reportedly cost more than $1.5 million.

The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet did not confirm who covered the security bill by time of publication.

The Duke and Duchess's April tour saw them visit Sydney, the NSW Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Canberra, Uluru and Adelaide.

The couple based themselves in Sydney and Canberra, flying in and out of other capital cities for day visits.

They spent one night 'glamping' in Uluru at luxury Longitude 131 resort.

In Sydney the royals stayed at the Governor-General's residence Admiralty House, on the water in Kirribilli, and in Canberra they stayed at the Governor-General's residence at Yarralumla.

The Queen's visit in 2011 cost more than $2.6 million, not including security, largely due to a $1.8 million transport bill because the royals chartered an airliner for their trip to and from the UK.

William, Kate and George travelled first class to and from the UK on commercial airlines.
