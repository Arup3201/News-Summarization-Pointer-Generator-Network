A new communications satellite that has both public and government applications has been launched into space aboard a private rocket.

The 22-story SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Tuesday evening, carrying the 7,000-pound satellite.

It will be placed in geostationary orbit. That means it will orbit at a fixed point above Earth, in sync with the Earthâ€™s rotation.

We have liftoff: A Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 40 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is carrying its first commercial payload, a communications satellite

The launch was originally scheduled for early this year, but has been delayed by technical issues with the rocket. The last try was on Thanksgiving Day when two attempts were aborted.

The SES-8 satellite will be used in conjunction with another communications systems to increase bandwidth capacity in Asia and provide expansion of services such as maritime communications and distance learning programs.

'I'd like to thank SES for taking a chance on SpaceX,' company founder and chief executive Elon Musk posted on Twitter an hour before the launch. 'We've given it our all.'

About 30 minutes after liftoff, the satellite, known as SES-8 and worth more than $100 million, was in an elliptical orbit that reached more than 50,000 miles from Earth, about a quarter of the way to the moon.

Blastoff: After two scrubbed launch attempts, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket finally blasted off on Tuesday to send a commercial satellite where no SpaceX payload has gone before: 22,000 miles up, into geostationary orbit

From there, SES-8 will maneuver itself down to a circular, 22,369-mile (36,000-km) high orbit to provide television, broadband and other communications services to customers in India, China, Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia.

The delivery of the SES-8 satellite 'confirms the upgraded Falcon 9 launch vehicle delivers to the industry's highest performance standards,' Musk said in a statement after the launch.

'We appreciate SES's early confidence in SpaceX and look forward to launching additional SES satellites in the years to come,' he said.

SES-8 is the first commercial communications satellite to be launched from Cape Canaveral in four years.

In the 1980s, the United States dominated the commercial launch industry, now worth about $6.5 billion a year, a report by the Satellite Industry Association trade organization showed.

Game changer: SES reportedly paid less than $60 million for the launch, which is tens of millions of dollars less than the going rate for satellite launches heading for geostationary orbit

The global satellite industry overall had revenues of nearly $190 billion in 2012, including nearly $90 billion in television services alone, the trade group said.

'It's an extremely important satellite for us,' Martin Halliwell, chief technology officer of SES, told reporters before the launch.

'We know that as we go forward into these very significant growth markets that it's absolutely critical that we have a cost-effective and efficient way to get to orbit. That's really what SpaceX has brought us,' Halliwell said.

Previous SES satellites were launched primarily aboard Russian Proton and European Ariane rockets, which cost far more than the approximately $55 million the company paid for its ride on SpaceX's Falcon booster, he said.

Up up and away: SpaceX has a dozen Falcon 9 launches on its manifest for next year, including more geostationary satellites

Halliwell would not say exactly how much SpaceX undercut the competition, but did say SES received a discount by agreeing to fly on Falcon 9's first mission to high orbits used by communications satellites.

In addition to a September 29 test flight of an upgraded Falcon 9, older versions of the rocket flew five times successfully, including three missions for NASA to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, which orbits about 250 miles above Earth.

SpaceX's launch schedule includes nearly 50 missions, worth about $4 billion. About 75 percent of the flights are for commercial customers.

The company needs one more successful launch of its upgraded Falcon rocket to be eligible to compete to carry the U.S. military's largest and most expensive satellites, a market now monopolized by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
