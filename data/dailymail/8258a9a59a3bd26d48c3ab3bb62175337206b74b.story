It is the perfect invention for anyone who needs a gentle reminder to get off the sofa.

Google has invented a talking shoe that can sense activity – and inactivity – and tells the wearer when they need to get moving.

Fitted with a host of gadgets that measure movement, direction and balance, the built-in microprocessor connects to an audio speaker in the tongue of the Adidas trainer.

Stop motion: The sneakers are designed to detect when its wearer is moving or not moving, and may let you know that it doesn't like being inactive

Commentary: The shoe may be programmed to offer encouragement or trash talk

The gadgets are programmed to 
translate the pressure sensor and accelerometer readings into simple 
audio instructions for the wearer.

But not content simply to give someone
 feedback, the inventors at Google have given the shoes their own 
personality – that of a sarcastic, impatient personal trainer who cheers
 and sneers in equal measure.

When the wearer, for example, is 
stationary for too long, the trainers will say, ‘This is super boring’, 
or ‘Let’s do this’.

When someone ups their activity, the shoes will pipe
 up with, ‘That’s more like it’, and ‘I love the feel of the wind in my 
laces’.

And increasing to a sprint will prompt the speakers to call out:
 ‘Call 911, you are on fire’, or the ultimate in praise: ‘You have made 
me a very proud shoe.’

Where am I? The shoe utilizes Bluetooth technology to connect itself to the internet, and can provide location and directions using Google's mapping app

Cheerleaders: The shoes can also utilize social networking sites, allowing a wearer's friends to comment and 'like' the performance

He got game: The footwear could do all the trash talking for you during a high-intensity game on the court

The trainers also connect to the 
internet via bluetooth and an Android phone and work with Google’s 
mapping software to track and plot runs.

Mike Glaser, product marketing manager
 for Google, said: ‘The trainer has pressure sensors in the sole and all
 of those collect the wearer’s data in real time.

‘So if I’m running, it recognises how 
many times my foot hits the ground in a minute through the accelerometer
 and sends the information to the web to an Android app allowing us to 
tell a very rich story of the wearer.’

But, unfortunately for anyone who 
likes the sound of super-smart trainers, there are no plans to put them 
on sale.

Google, which unveiled the trainers at the SXSW technology 
festival in Austin, Texas, developed the concept to showcase the 
possibilities of integrating everyday objects with cutting-edge 
technology.

Advertising executive Aman Govil said 
the shoe was an exercise in showing what could be done – ‘an experiment’
 in connecting any kind of object to the web and using it to collect and
 analyse information.

Job well done: The shoe can offer compliments to its owner on a particularly good basketball game or other athletic performance
