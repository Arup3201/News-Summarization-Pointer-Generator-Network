Tenderly caressing and nuzzling each other, they look like the epitome of lovebirds.

This amorous pair of African lovebirds were spotted by tourist guide Paul Harding, 56,  at the Birds of Eden sanctuary, Western Cape, South Africa.

He said: 'The birds were sat on a branch cuddling and canoodling – they were definitely the epitome of lovebirds.

'One was lovingly grooming and caressing the other and they seemed oblivious to their surroundings.

'The pure joy and pleasure of the birds together is difficult to describe but it caught my eye – their embrace is so close and emotional.

'I do not think the birds could have got any closer and they were completely absorbed by each other. Nothing else seemed important.'

African lovebirds are a species of parrot native to Africa and they mate for life, often spending long periods sitting together.

Birds of Eden is the world's largest free flight aviary, housing approximately 3,500 birds of 220 species from different continents.
