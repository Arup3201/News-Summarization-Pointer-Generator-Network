It’s the moment every parent dreads – soothing a child who's had his heart broken. 

But this little boy's heartbreak happens in the worst possible way when he hears the news... from his own mother!

Chatting to the boy during their drive in the car, mum starts a conversation that soon balloons into a full-blown histrionic affair, complete with dramatic sobs, distraught weeping and angry tears.

This four-year-old gets his heart broken when his mother tells him that his playschool pal Emily has made friends with other boys

At first he is bewildered and doesn't seem to understand when she tells him that his friend Emily likes a boy who called her.

The boy opens his mouth wide and starts wailing: 'I don’t like that.' Gasping between his sobs, he wails: ‘It hurts my feelings… I thought her [sic] was my friend but now her [sic] doesn't like me anymore.’

His words eaten up by more sobs, the child is unable to complete his sentence.

The highly amusing conversation slowly spirals out of control as the mother tries to calm her child, who becomes more and more inconsolable as the conversation continues

Mum does her best to reassure him but his wails grow louder and more distraught as he realises that Emily is not solely his friend. 

She reminds him that he likes other people, saying: ‘You know how you have so many friends at school?’ 

She then tells him that Emily can have lots of friends as well, but the boy is not having any of it.

‘But I don’t like it if she doesn't call me anymore,’ he yells, getting to the crux of his problems.

‘Well then you call her, the mother suggests.

‘But I don’t know how to call her,’ he shouts, frustrated that his mother doesn't understand his problems. 

‘First I was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend,’ yells the little boy, who doesn't want his friend Emily to be pally with anyone else other than him 

‘I just want her to like me more better’ he says. ‘First I was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend.’

Mum tries to convince him that Emily can have lots of friends but his backseat crying continues, and even the reminder that he has lots of friends does nothing to ease the child’s woes. 

‘I want to call her right now,’ he says, clearly a man of action. But his plans to get his plan to get the friendship back on are thwarted when mum tells him that he can only get in touch with Emily later.

He tearfully agrees with the suggestion, but not without articulating his feelings one last time, yelling: ‘I don’t feel good because of Emily,’ heart-wrenchingly.
