Bacary Sagna confirms he is leaving Arsenal - click here to read

Another year gone, and another Arsenal first-team player has opted for pastures new. But unlike Robin van Persie two years ago, Bacary Sagna should not be subject to abuse.

The right back announced on Thursday that it was a certainty he will be leaving this summer, declining the club's final three-year contract offer of £80,000-a-week.

And even though Sagna looks to be joining a host of former Gunners at Manchester City, it's hard to blame a player who has been a loyal servant at the Emirates Stadium.

Time to go: Bacary Sagna has confirmed he will leave Arsenal in the summer

Silver lining: Sagna ended his Arsenal career by winning the FA Cup

The France defender was signed for £7.5million in 2006, and has fought admirably during a eight-year stint which has provided little success.

Signing on with the hope of joining Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires as Les Bleus who  lifted multiple trophies in north London, a fourth-place finish and limited European joy was the new realistic target.

In the midst of the lowest lows, Sagna was always one who would roll his sleeves up, never give in and urge team-mates to pick themselves up. It's no wonder Arsene Wenger was so keen to break his 'no long contract for over-30s' rule to keep one of his most consistent performers.

Sportsmail understands a £150,000-a-week deal with City has been lined up, leading to many Arsenal fans to criticise Sagna for 'showing no respect' and taking one final pay check.

But after eight years of being heralded as one of the best full backs in the league with barely anything in the shape of trophies to back that up, is it not just one final challenge for a player still at his peak?

Put simply, if it was about moving for silverware (as Samir Nasri justifies his move to Manchester City) right now is not the time to do it.

'Anything we win here will come from the 
heart and that’s what I want.

'It’s my dream and I see no point in 
speaking about other teams when I have these dreams.

'I think other 
people know that about me; I’m just hungry to win with Arsenal and 
that’s it.'

Sagna's reaction at the end of that FA Cup final win, nine years after their last triumph, said it all. Success is all he wanted at a club he obviously loves, and now he's got that, why not let him respond to other club's advances? He, and the fans, have got what they wanted.

After one of his finest seasons in an Arsenal shirt battling back from injury, it's the least Sagna deserves.

This stance was not applicable to Robin van Persie, Nasri and Emmanuel Adebayor's exits, though.

Van Persie, back in 2011, said: 'I’m sure I could win things at another team in another country, but would it feel like our trophy, my trophy? I’m not sure it would.

'Anything we win here will come from the heart and that’s what I want. It’s my dream and I see no point in speaking about other teams when I have these dreams. I think other people know that about me; I’m just hungry to win with Arsenal and that’s it.'

Those quotes - along with the pictures of Van Persie surrounded by Arsenal bedsheets and posters as a youngster - were music to fans' ears at the time, but now seem fake and twisted.

The club stuck by the Dutchman through countless seasons as he struggled with various knocks, but after one-and-a-half injury-free seasons scoring goals he had made his decision.

A move to Manchester United followed, and Van Persie even went on to write an open letter to Arsenal criticising their ambition. The respect was long gone after that.

Nasri had the chance to be the 'next Cesc Fabregas' after the Spaniard left for his boyhood club Barcelona (something he always admitted he was planning to do). Nasri could have been the hero of a side in need of one, he could have repaid Wenger for putting trust in him at such a young age.

He has been accused of taking the 'easy way out' of Arsenal, quitting as soon as some sort of crisis became apparent, and as soon as a suitable club threw money at him.

The departure of Adebayor - along with Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy - wasn't so critical on the pitch, but the Togolese angered fans with his attitude (and not least for sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate a goal for Manchester City against Arsenal back in 2009).

He constantly flirted with AC Milan, and in fact Wenger was fortunate to pocket £25m for the striker.

All this is in such contrast to Sagna, who was humble about his exit. Take his quotes in L'Equipe: 'It was an honour to grow in the shirt,' he said. 'Arsenal is a club that brought me a lot, both as a person and as a sportsman. Even though we had been criticised for quite some time due to the lack of trophies, I spent some magical moments (at Arsenal). If I had to do, I’d do it again.'

Out of all that, his admission that he would do it again really stands out. At 31 years of age, the time is right for Sagna to bow out, and Arsenal can look for a younger, and perhaps cheaper alternative.

Serge Aurier, Calum Chambers and Atsito Uchida have been linked with a move, but they will find it hard to match Sagna's ability, not least his dedication.

The time is right for a thanks, and good luck.
