Bernie Ecclestone has surprisingly been denied a place on the Formula One board, a snub that casts doubts on his future as the sport’s all-powerful Svengali.

Although grand prix’s octogenarian puppeteer walked free from a German court in August after a prolonged bribery trial, he has failed in his attempt to win back his place at Delta Topco, the board comprising the sport’s shareholders.

Sources have told Sportsmail that when the board met they insisted on conditions being imposed on Ecclestone’s return. 

Bernie Ecclestone will not be returning to the board of formula one despite the end of his bribery trial

Some within the sport are said to be unhappy about the adverse publicity Ecclestone's trial has brought

The sport's boss paid £60million to end the trial with his innocence intact in August of this year

The delay undermines Ecclestone’s bullish back-to-business mantra, summed up by his post-trial declaration: ‘I shall follow my old idea in life, “Don’t get mad; get even”. I haven’t got mad, but I am going to get even.’ 

It also contradicts his insistence in January, when he stepped down from Delta Topco to fight the accusations in Munich, that he would return in total command the moment the case was resolved. He paid £60million to end the trial and left with his innocence intact.

However, several shareholders were embarrassed when a High Court judge described Ecclestone as an ‘unreliable witness’ in a civil action earlier this year. The wildest, but not necessarily ill-informed, rumours suggest that Ecclestone could be discarded within a fortnight.

It remains equally likely that his critics on the board are trying to impose rules to govern his future conduct in the business. Either way, it seems, he no longer has carte blanche to act as he wishes. However, even though he turns 84 at the end of the month, Ecclestone is showing no inclination to give in to time or pressure. 

The Formula One season moves on from Singapore to Japan, with Lewis Hamilton in the championship lead

Ecclestone had insisted that it would be business as usual after his trial, but things may not be as simple

Ecclestone’s long-term protector and greatest admirer has been Donald Mackenzie, the chairman of Formula One’s majority owners CVC. An affable man in private, Mackenzie is publicly reticent to the point of invisibility. He declined to comment. As did Ecclestone, who is not expected at Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix but will be in Sochi, Russia for the inaugural grand prix there next week.

Yesterday the Land of the Rising Sun was a blanket of rain and cloud, with Typhoon Phanfone expected here at the end of the weekend. Despite that, and with not a single car running, the main grandstand was full. They adore Formula One here, a love affair that started when James Hunt drove through life-threatening rain in Fuji 1976 to beat Niki Lauda.

The typhoon has been gathering potency in the western Pacific Ocean and is due to arrive in mainland Japan, possibly during the grand prix.

The FIA’s latest weather forecast indicates it will strike either very late on Sunday or on Monday. But some rain, at least, is expected to interrupt the race. 

Lewis Hamilton seemed affronted when it was suggested he did not want a wet race in Japan this weekend

There is no chance of the main event being moved to Monday. This travelling circus is scuttling off to Sochi with barely time to pack, as it is. Ecclestone’s right-hand man, Pasquale Lattuneddu, is missing the Japanese race and will go straight to Russia to make sure everything is shipshape for his master and his master’s big buddy, President Putin.

Neither of the two world championship participants, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, view the rain as entirely unwelcome. ‘The more the better,’ said Rosberg, who trails Hamilton by three points after an electrical problem in Singapore a fortnight ago.

As for Hamilton, two of the most stellar drives of his career were victories in the wet. In Fuji in 2007, when the safety car literally almost ran out of fuel because it stayed out for 19 long laps, and at Silverstone the following year.

He was understandably indignant when he was asked how he fared in bad conditions, replying: ‘Have you not been watching Formula One for the last eight years?’  

Along the paddock at Ferrari, Fernando Alonso could not commit to the team or, indeed, to a move away. The smokescreen, mirrors and conjecture surrounding his future was, it was suggested by a French journalist, being whipped up by Alonso’s manager Flavio Briatore. Ferrari’s PR chief nodded knowingly as the old bronzed plotter’s name was mentioned.

Cash-strapped Caterham, who were recently bought out by an unidentified ‘consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern investors’ said that they are planning to race despite bailiffs seizing items from their Oxfordshire factory this week.
