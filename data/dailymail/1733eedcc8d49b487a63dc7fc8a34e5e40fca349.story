Danah Stephens, the mother of  16 week old Paris Vince-Stephens who was shaken to death by her father, has been found dead at her Bristol home

A mother whose boyfriend was jailed for shaking their baby to death after he lost his temper when his cannabis ran out has been found dead.  

Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she suffered 'catastrophic' head injuries and died after being shaken by her father William Stephens at her home in Bristol. 

The 25-year-old shook the baby so hard she was bleeding from her eyes and he was jailed last year for manslaughter.

Almost a year later the child's mother, Danah Vince, 20, was found dead at her home in Southmead in Bristol. 

Miss Vince was also accused of killing her daughter but was acquitted during the seven week trial last year. 

Her body was found on November 29 and a post mortem into her death has so far been inconclusive.  

On the day of Paris's death, Stephens and Miss Vince had become 'agitated' because they had run out of drugs. The pair argued and Miss Vince  left her daughter in the care of her father while she went out to the doctors. 

While she was out Stephens is said to have shaken the youngster after losing his temper with the child when she was crying in January last year. 

The shaking caused a fatal brain bleed and Paris was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital where she was put on life support for three days until she died. During the trial a shocked expert said he had never before seen such a severe case of bleeding in the eyes.

Sentencing him to six years in prison for manslaughter, Mr Justice Teare told Stephens: '

'This is a case where a loss of control has resulted in a fatal act of violence on a defenceless baby.

'You will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter.' 

He added that Stephens' learning disabilities could have been a factor in the child's death. 

During the trial, at Bristol Crown Court, the jury heard the young parents had a 'volatile' relationship and there was evidence of arguments and fighting. Social services stepped in and the couple had both signed agreements not to resort to domestic violence.

Paris Vince-Stephens was just 16 weeks old when she was shaken so violenty by her father she died 

But, even though Stephens, who had learning difficulties and an IQ in the low 50s, was subject to a restraining order banning him from contacting Ms Vince, the court was told there was evidence he was still living with her on the day Paris was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital. 

An examination on Paris's body found she had either been shaken or suffered a head injury from hitting her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both.

During his trial Stephens, who has an IQ of 52 and cannot read, initially told police he had not touched his daughter all day - claiming she had simply gone 'all floppy' while he was feeding her.

But he later admitted he 'slightly shook her' at Miss Vince's flat in Bristol.

The court heard Stephens had previous convictions and warnings for violence relating to Miss Vince and his own mother, and previously punched a pregnant woman 'a number of times'.

He had also used crack cocaine and heroin.  

He had been handed community orders, cautions, reprimands and warnings for the offences.

Ignatious Hughes, defending, said Stephens's 'modest' upbringing in a 'drug-ridden' neighbourhood meant it was 'hardly surprising' he had acquired previous convictions and a drug habit.

William Stephens was jailed for six years for manslaughter after he caused the death of his daughter 

Mr Hughes also explained that Stephens had been attacked several times while in custody - including scalding water being thrown at his face - due to the nature of his offence. 

Speaking after the case, James Ward, crown advocate for the Crown Prosecution Service South West, described the case as 'difficult' and said people needed to understand Stephen's sentence was given because he did not intend to kill the child.

'He didn’t intend to kill the baby, nor did he intend to cause it really serious harm.

'Also, the defendant does have serious learning difficulties. His IQ is between 52 and 54. He lost control when he had that baby, probably because it cried.

'As a result of that, he shook it and that baby died.'

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Constabulary said they were called to Miss Vince's house on the afternoon of November 29 after her body had been found. 

He said: 'A post mortem into the death has been held but this was inconclusive.

'The matter was referred to the coroner as a sudden death. We are continuing to make inquiries on behalf of the coroner.
