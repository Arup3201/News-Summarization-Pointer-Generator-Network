The fashion publicist who confessed to the brutal butchering of his girlfriend on New York’s Lower East Side was today sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, the heaviest sentence available for the crime.

The 33-year-old Raul Barrera had confessed to first beating then stabbing his beautiful girlfriend of three years, Sarah Coit, in her Clinton Street apartment after she had told him she was done with their relationship.

He left her disemboweled and nearly headless, with a steak knife still embedded in her skull, as frantic neighbors tried to find where her screams were coming from.

Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos said Barrera was looking for a ‘show worthy of popcorn’ according to the New York Post.

When beating was no longer enough, he 
began stabbing the young woman with a total of five knives, Mr Bogdanos 
said. ‘Two were butcher knives,’ he said, ‘the kind you use on the 
toughest joins in the toughest animals.’

He noted that the beautiful blonde was only 23.

Ms Coit was still alive when Barrera 
finished. Her intestines were spilling out of her body, there was a 
steak knife jetting out of her skull, and here head was nearly severed.

‘I don’t know. I lost it,’ Barrera is heard mumbling to a police officer and a prosecutor just five hours after the brutal slaying of the young Lacoste sales manager.

Barrera said the pair had begun arguing before the ‘tussle’ began and ‘things got out of control’.

He said: ‘Then we started arguing a little bit. Got into a tussle and there was this silver cart thing next to the edge of the kitchen counter and we must have knocked it down and we must have knocked it down and all the cutlery, the knives were in the…they just all fell to the ground and then we fell to the ground. 

‘And I was on top of her. Then my hand just got a cut and it was bleeding a lot profusely and I just…things got out of control.’

After stabbing Miss Coit repeatedly, he then admitted to dragging her, as she lay dying, from her living room into her bedroom before flinging his coat on her, according to the New York Post.

Rather than calling the emergency services, he phoned his parents, sister and his son to ‘apologise,’ changed out of his blood-soaked clothes and left the New York apartment to hail a cab.

All the while his girlfriend lay bleeding out in her bedroom.

When asked by the prosecutor whether he thought to call 911, Barrera simply answered: ‘No.’

At no point in the interview did Barrera ask what condition Coit was in, but he did note that her condition was ‘really bad’ at the point of leaving the flat.

He was then asked why he did not call an ambulance. ‘I was just afraid, panicked, scared. I just, I didn’t know what to expect.’

Earlier in the trial, Miss Coit’s father, Lynde Coit, laid bare  his grief at the loss of his daughter as he testified in court.

In an emotional testimony, the millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, Connecticut said: ‘When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue, her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.'

Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post.

Miss Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the building next door.

As such, Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering the floor.
