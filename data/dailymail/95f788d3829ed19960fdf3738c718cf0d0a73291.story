Mr Spencer, 37, was found bashed to death by his house mate on the back patio of his Coomera home, on the Gold Coast, with head injuries early morning on the first of October.

The father-of-two, aged 37, was found with head injuries early in the morning last month

It was reported that a vintage tennis racquet was found near Mr Spencer's body, covered in his blood

But Superintendent Dave Hutchinson could not confirm whether it was in fact the murder weapon.

'It was damaged during the incident and has the victim's blood on it,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin,'the victim died of blunt force trauma but I can't say it was all that was used.'

Gold Coast Police are now on the hunt for a vehicle which they believe may have been the offender's getaway car. 

A dark coloured 2008 or 2009 Ford Falcon sedan was seen on Foxwell Road and Hope Island Road at Coomera between 3am and 4am on the morning of the murder.

Police are confident the vehicle was connected to the murder.

'The vehicle of interest coincides with information from witnesses who saw the vehicle leaving the crime scene and in the vicinity of the crime scene,' said Superintendent Hutchinson. 

'We have information from witnesses that  the driver of the vehicle was female and that there was a male in the front passenger seat.'

'From the review of our CCTV footage we can track the movements of this vehicle to a certain extent and we can show the vehicle arriving in Foxwell road and moving around the Foxwell road area and we can track along Foxwell road in a westerly direction and the vehicle subsequently ended up on Hope Island road,' he said.

'We can track it along Hope Island road before a certain distance before it eventually we lose sight of it as it's heading east towards Runaway Bay.'

'We have a number of avenues of inquiry that we are still following but this is certainly an exciting lead for us,' he said.

Police are urging anyone who may have seen the vehicle or has any information which could assist with the investigation  to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
