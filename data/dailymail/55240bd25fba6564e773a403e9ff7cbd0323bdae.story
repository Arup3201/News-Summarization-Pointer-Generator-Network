The ex-front man of a 'homo-punk' band has been removed as the official Girl Scouts spokesman after outraged mothers complained.

Risque videos from Joshua Ackley's band The Dead Betties led to a flurry of complaints by parents who questioned whether he was the best person to represent the Girl Scout movement.

Videos of the chief press spokesman's old band, which were referred to as 'homo punk' by various media outlets showed a woman being stalked and a man writhing in newspaper.

Outrage: Joshua Ackley is no longer the official spokesman of the Girl Scouts after parents complained about his punk band past

Mr Ackley had been the chief representative of the Scouts for several years, and also worked as a blogger for the organization, Breitbart reported.

He has been the main port of call for everything, from Girl Scouts wanting advice to parents concerned about changes in the movement.

He was also sent in to soothe concerned mothers who claimed Planned Parenthood brochures were found at girls-only UN panel hosted by the group in 2011.

Although the organization denied any knowledge of the brochure, the group has come under criticism in recent years for its distribution of funds from cookie sales and alleged support for abortion, the Washington Times reported.Â 

Parents singled out two Dead Bettie 
videos still available on YouTube, although the band's account has been 
inactive for several years.

In one, scenes of a woman being stalked and then strangled are cut in with footage of Mr Ackley, who performed under the name Joshua Starr, and the band playing.

In another, a man is seen seemingly touching himself inappropriately while surrounded by newspapers to the band's raw punk sound.

Conservative campaign groups have been criticizing Mr Ackley's role in the Girl Scout's movement for more than a year.

While he will no longer have as visible a profile within the organization, and his name has been removed from the press contact page, the Girl Scouts have said that he remains working in the press department.

The Girl Scouts have not yet responded to a request for a comment from Mail Online.
