Dogs were forced to swallow packets of cocaine by South American gangsters so the drug could be smuggled into Europe, it was claimed yesterday.

The 48 animals were then butchered to retrieve the consignments once they landed at Linate airport in Milan.

An Italian judge yesterday ordered 49 suspects aged 19 to 37 from Ecuador, Peru and El Salvador – thought to be part of youth gangs known as ‘pandillas’ – to stand trial in October.

Prosecutors said a vet in Mexico 
helped the gangs, even carrying out surgery to cram larger amounts of 
drugs around the dogs’ organs.

Packages were wrapped in black vinyl 
tape to shield them from X-ray checks in Italy – where dogs do not have 
to go into quarantine. It is not clear what pretext was used to fly the 
dogs into Italy.

Police wiretaps led to arrests in the Milan area in March. The operation was first uncovered in April last year when a female trafficker confessed.

Brutal: One of the dogs that was killed after being used to move cocaine around

Police in Pisa had been called to the
house of a South American family, who were having a violent row about a
sick dog that had arrived on a plane a few days earlier.

The woman said that the dog had ingested drugs. It was taken to the vet for surgery and its life was saved.

Human mules often swallow carefully 
wrapped packages of drugs or stuff them in to body cavities to keep them
hidden as they smuggle them through airport security and across 
borders.

But if plastic
pellets or condoms housing valuable consignments of Class A drugs burst
in transit, the mules face an agonising death.

This is not the first case of dogs 
being used as drugs mules - a few years ago a four-year-old sheepdog 
was flown from Colombia to New York City with cocaine sewn into its 
belly.

Customs agents said the sheepdog had 10 cocaine-filled
condoms sewn into its stomach as a way of smuggling the drug into the 
U.S.

Suspicious agents ordered X-rays afrer notcing the sickly condition of the dog.

They then spotted the condoms, which apparently had caused an infection that kept the dog from eating.

In
2008 a graphic TV advert showing a fictional dog being used as a drugs 
mule forms part of a £1million government campaign against cocaine use.

Weapons: Other items recovered by police include a knife and a handgun

Charges: The 49 suspects, aged 19 to 37, from Peru, Ecuador and El Salvador, will stand trial in October

Claims: The gang is suspected of killing about 50 dogs to smuggle drugs
