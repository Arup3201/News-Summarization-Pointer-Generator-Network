Bright future: Anthony Vaeao died in his school gym shortly before he was due to graduate and enroll in a college football programme

An 18-year-old high school football star collapsed and died without warning while playing basketball in the gym.

Anthony Vaeao was about to graduate from school in San Marcos, California, and had a promising future ahead of him playing junior college football at college.

But the 6ft 3in, 23-stone lineman collapsed in the gym at Mission Hills High on Thursday afternoon and was dead before paramedics arrived.

A friend and team-mate on the school football team told the North County Times about the final, poignant text message Anthony had sent to him after leaving the school prom.

'His last text to me said, "We ride together, we die together,"' said a weeping Aaron Leauma. 'It's too soon, man. It's too soon.'

People who knew the popular 18-year-old described him as a 'huge' young man, with big hair and a big personality to match.

The day before his death, an excited Anthony had posted on his Facebook page: 'Just had a meeting w my college coach papers are set and im ready to go. Thank yu lord.'

Principal David Cochrane told the San Diego Union-Tribune that around 50 footballers were gathered at the hospital within an hour of the teenager's death.

Tragedy: Flowers, candles and tributes were piled high outside Mission Hills High and the school held a candlelight vigil at its football stadium for the popular pupil

Anthony's grandmother Sepoima Vaeao told News 8: 'I went to the hospital and he's gone. I didn't have time to talk to him. I didn't have time to talk to my grandson.'

He said Anthony had 'one of those personalities that you can’t stay mad at him.'

A distraught cousin and classmate added: 'He was Mission Hills. He was the heart of this school.'

The school held a candlelight vigil on Thursday night at the football stadium, with 2,000 people mourning Anthony's tragic death beside a growing pile of flowers and candles.

His mother spoke at the vigil, telling the crowds in the stands: 'My son left a legacy here. All you people here, my son touched.'

Liz Delaney, from San Marcos, whose son played on the football team with Anthony, said: 'He was just the coolest kid. He was such a presence, this huge Samoan with this big smile.'

Friends and well-wishers posted moving tributes on YouTube videos of Anthony, some created to celebrate his life, and others made earlier to attract the attention of college recruiters - showing his skill at football.

An autopsy was completed Friday and the Medical Examiner’s Office listed the cause of death as 'pending.'
