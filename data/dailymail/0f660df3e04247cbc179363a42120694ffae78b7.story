The Django Unchained actress who accused police of racially profiling her for kissing her boyfriend in public has refused to apologize - despite calls from civil rights activists.

Daniele Watts claimed she was harassed by the Los Angeles Police Department, who arrested her as she made out with Brian James Lucas in a car parked on the street last week. 

However, police maintained there was no racial element to the incident, prompting civil rights experts to accuse the actress of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back.

But despite the backlash, Watts last night refused to apologize for her comments in a statement.

Although she made no mention of race in the document, sent via her publicist, Watts maintained that she was not obligated to present identification to police.

She said: 'It is a constitutional right that we do not have to present ID to any member of law enforcement unless we are being charged with a crime.'

Watts and Lucas were questioned last week by officers investigating a report of lewd conduct. Watts, who is black, refused to provide identification and was briefly handcuffed until police identified her.

An audio recording, obtained by MailOnline, reveals the hysterical actress confronting police in a heated exchange during which she uses the N-word, and claims legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV.

The fallout from the incident led to prominent civil rights activists decrying Watts in public and saying that she was harming their cause.

Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson, who initially rallied behind Watts, told reporters: 'I for one was very outspoken about it.

'We take racial profiling very seriously. It's not a play thing. It's not trivial.'

But he said that, in this instance, there was a 'provable cause' for Watts's detention, explaining: 'You must have your facts. You can't rush to judgment. If you do that, you have no credibility.'

According to NBC, he added: 'It's like crying wolf - after a while, it has no meaning.'

Project Islamic Hope President Najee Al also spoke out against the actress, who played Coco in the 2012 film Django Unchained. 

He told CBS: 'She should be embarrassed She's the one that told the lie. She came and stated she's a victim of racial profiling. We found out later on based on new information that she wasn't.'

'I played a copy on TV!' Watts played police cadet Angela Mullen (pictured) in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds'. In her statement, she maintained that she was not obligated to present identification to police when they asked

The newly-unearthed audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts straddling Lucas in a parked car.

Recordings captured the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification.

Watts and the officers involved disputed whether her ID card was necessary, followed by Watts bringing her acting experience into the fray. 

In the audio recording, Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down.

She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me.

'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' 

Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend.

Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out.

Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity.  

Watts and Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex.

Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers.

'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. 

The LAPD has said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets. A spokesman yesterday said the department had no response to Watts's statement.

The actress's publicist, Bill McCoy, said she is not planning to take further action.
