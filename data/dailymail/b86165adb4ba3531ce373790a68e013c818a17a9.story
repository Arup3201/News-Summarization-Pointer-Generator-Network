High demand: YSL Forever Light Creator has already been reserved by thousands of women

It goes on sale for the first time today, but it seems the latest face cream that promises miraculous results is already a sellout hit with women.

Some 15,000 have downloaded vouchers online for a sample of the Forever Light Creator anti-ageing cream, which claims to give you a ‘flawless complexion’ by using the reflection of light.

And more than 3,000 have reserved the product, made by Yves Saint Laurent.

In fact, its makers claim, demand is so high that they have set up a helpline for those who discover their nearest pharmacy has run out.

The product comes as a lotion or a serum and is said to even out the skin’s complexion and remove dark spots and shadows. It apparently contains three types of sugars called glycans which reflect light and make the skin more radiant.

Glycans occur naturally in our skin but gradually decline as we age, which is partly why our complexion becomes duller, less flexible and more uneven.

The creams cost from £35 to £82, depending on the size of the bottle, and are aimed at women over 25.

Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said the product was a ‘world first’ which had taken three years to develop.

‘Our research has shown that women are now more concerned about age spots and uneven skin tone than they are about wrinkles,’ she said.

‘Forever Light Creator recreates truly luminous skin. It also significantly reduces the appearance of age spots, the tell-tale areas of darker pigmentation which distinguish an older face from the smooth, uniform complexion of youth, and gives skin a flawless look.’

The manufacturers claim that after one week of using the cream skin is ‘noticeably’ improved, and after two months red and dark spots will lighten and the complexion will become ‘more uniform’.

But experts dismissed such promises and said it was usually impossible for any cream to banish all blemishes. Dr Ross Perry, a cosmetic surgeon for Cosmedics Skin Clinics, said: ‘Skin tone and pigmentation are so subjective.

‘There is no miracle treatment. As soon as you go back into the sun or get a bit of a tan, all pigmentation will come back. You can reduce it but it can easily return.’

He added: ‘Even the medically based products that have been clinically proven have a limited efficacy for removing pigmentation.’

Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist based in Harley Street, said: ‘I don’t know of any topical non-prescription product that will make a major impact on red areas, which usually reflect the presence of dilated blood vessels in the skin as a consequence of either sun damage or rosacea.’
