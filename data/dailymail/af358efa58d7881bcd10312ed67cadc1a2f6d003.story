The British SAS regiment is renowned for its tough selection process.

And now it seems that the animal kingdom is holding trials for its own special forces.

These squirrels were videoed tackling what appears to be a tough obstacle course during a clip posted to YouTube.

One of the squirrels takes on the assault course in Steve Barley's back garden

The creatures take part in the daring assault course made up of twists, jumps and turns in Steve Barley's back garden.

Mr Barley created the 'double assault course' for the critters and even provides a running commentary.

He begins the clip by saying: 'It's 5.30 in the morning. Most sensible people are in their beds. But I'm on squirrel watch.

'It may be wet but the squirrels are hungry.'

The video has now been viewed more than 200,000 times online.

On Mr Barley's YouTube account, he says:'How could we beat the success of our Black Squirrel Assault Course?

'By building an even bigger assault course out of an old ironing board, sink plunger and bits of old wood! This time we've gone for the double! Bring on those cheeky squirrels.'

Grey squirrels, originally from North America, were released in the UK by 19th century landowners.

They are now very common and widespread.

Grey squirrels are active during the day, foraging for food in trees and on the ground â€“ they often visit peanut feeders in gardens. In the autumn they spend time storing nuts to eat during the winter.

They also tend to breed in between January and April and, if food is plentiful, they may have a second litter in the summer.

They are extremely successful and have replaced our native red squirrels over most of the UK.
