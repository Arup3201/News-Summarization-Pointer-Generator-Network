London's new £4.2billion 'super sewer' will stop the capital returning to the days of the 'Great Stink' but could see household bills rise by £80, it has been revealed.

The 15-mile Thames Tideway Tunnel, estimated to cost nearly half of the 2012 Olympics, will take 10 years to build and will be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the UK water industry.

It will stretch all the way from Acton in West London, along the general path of the River Thames, towards Limehouse where it will veer north-east to Abbey Mills Pumping Station near Stratford.

It is said to be needed to help prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year

Situated 65 metres below the river, and with a capacity of 1.6million cubic metres, the sewer is said to be needed to prevent an average of 55million tonnes of untreated sewage being discharged into the river each year.

Thames Water has insisted the multi-billion pound project is crucial to stop London returning to the days of the 'Great Stink' when the river acted as an open sewer.

At the time, in the mid-1880s, residents complained of the smell from the river which was full of raw sewage.

The problem was eventually solved by engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who built a 1,300 mile network of Victorian sewers to stop untreated sewage being pumped into the Thames.

But, while they have worked well for more than 150 years, Thames Tideway Tunnel Ltd has now submitted plans for a new system to help combat the rising amount of sewage which overflows from the sewers every year.

Exploratory works for the £4.2billion project have already been carried out in the River Thames. Construction could get underway as early as 2016 if given the go-ahead

Built from three main construction sites in Fulham, Battersea and Southwark, the Thames Tideway Tunnel is expected to help treat some of the 55million tonnes of 'overflow' raw sewage which the current system cannot cope with.

The new system, if given the official go ahead, will intercept the sewage before it enters the river and carefully treat it before pumping it back into the water in East London.

Preparatory construction work could potentially start as early as next year if plans are given the go-ahead – but it will come at a price.

Thames Water estimates that household bills will have to rise by £80 a year to finance the sewer, The Independent reported.

However, while regulators have questioned the cost of the 'super-sewer', Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great-great-grandson of Sir Joseph, said he supports public investment into the project.

He told the newspaper: 'These major public works need to be done.'

If given the green light, preparatory work is expected to begin next year before full construction starts in 2016. The project has a targeted completion date of 2023.
