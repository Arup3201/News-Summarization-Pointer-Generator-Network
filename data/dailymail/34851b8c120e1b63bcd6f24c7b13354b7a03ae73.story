No matter how poorly they play, Louis van Gaal's Manchester United team are proving devilishly hard to beat.

Here at a bouncing Deepdale, United were for long periods as feeble, as poor, as we have seen in recent times. A goal down as the hour mark came and went, United were in very real danger of being tossed out of the FA Cup by a team from League One.

Without so much as a shot on goal to their name at half-time, there was no real reason to think United would survive the one from Preston left back Scott Laird that flew past David de Gea in the 47th minute.

Wayne Rooney was back up front but to no avail. United had been awful. Again. Radamel Falcao had been invisible. Again. The Colombian wasn't even on the field as United mounted their comeback.

There is something about Van Gaal's team, though, that is preventing current difficulties reaching crisis level. The United manager called it 'team spirit'. It was 'incredible', he said.

That may be overstating things a little. His players are paid to win football matches. If they don't have team spirit then what do they have?

Nevertheless, here again United found a way to get through as first Ander Herrera and then Marouane Fellaini scored goals that turned looming defeat in to victory and secured a quarter final tie at home to Arsenal.

There was even a late shot on target – and a goal for Rooney – from the penalty spot. It was the United captain's first shot on goal of the calendar year and he will be glad that one of the season's most peculiar statistics is no more.

United definitely will have to be better than this when Arsene Wenger and his players turn up at Old Trafford next month but that won't worry Van Gaal now.

The night's crucial goals – the first two - also came from two players he didn't even particularly rate when he took the United job last summer. That won't worry him either.

Somehow Van Gaal and his United team continue to carry their heads above water and, despite the manner of their football, there is something to be said for that.

Certainly after 50 minutes here, they looked to be in real trouble. Neither team managed to create anything in the first half but Preston surged from the blocks at the start of the second period to put the frighteners on United.

Centre forward Joe Garner had carried a physical threat throughout but it was his run from deep that found United stretched in the 47th minute and enabled Preston to score.

As Garner moved forwards, Laird appeared at speed to his left and although the defender's cross shot looked as though it may be heading wide of the far post, Antonio Valencia stretched out a foot and deflected the ball beneath De Gea and in to the goal.

As Simon Grayson's players celebrated wildly, United's players took their positions for the restart looking a little stunned. It's hard to say why. These type of episodes have, after all, become rather too familiar over recent months.

Briefly, Van Gaal was staring at his own Olympiacos moment. It was defeat in Greece almost a year ago that signalled the beginning of the end for Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes. There would have been no such threat to the current United manager had they lost here but this was a performance that was shaping up to be every bit as lame as that one in Athens.

As it was, United did find something from somewhere. Van Gaal certainly helped, taking Falcao off and sending on Ashley Young. A change of shape released Fellaini further forwards and that, in the end, proved to be effective.

For a while, not much changed. Preston seemed buoyed by their goal and seemed intent on scoring a second. Sometimes, though, you need something to go your way and United got a small break on the way to their equaliser in the 65th minute.

Preston seemed secure enough as Daley Blind and Young funnelled the ball through the middle but when Herrera sought to beat a Preston defender to the ball he had the determination and presence to force it in to the corner past goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann from ten yards.

It was a peculiar goal but, for United, it was hugely important. Equally important, and impressive, was the manner in which they managed to find another gear from that point on.

Preston didn't disappear from the game completely. Garner, for instance, brought a plunging save from De Gea with a decent header.

United, though, managed to establish themselves as the genuinely dominant force and for the first time they brought a cutting edge too.

Fellaini's influence was growing and United had the intelligence to play to that strength. The Belgian is becoming increasingly effective as a 'Plan B' and when his header from an Antonio Valencia cross was saved by Stuckmann in the 72nd minute he lashed the loose ball across goal and high in to the corner with a certain amount of glee.

With that, the game seemed over and Preston's race run. They had enjoyed a sight of glory but good teams can ruin things like that pretty quickly and United, for all their issues, remain clinical when it matters.

There was still time for Rooney to score, his penalty coming after Stuckmann dashed from goal to floor him rather recklessly. There were subsequent suggestions of a dive but that was something of a side issue.

United's weird season rolls on. It may yet end at Wembley.
