The minister's staff deleted negative references  to his role in NHS scandals

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham’s staff have been editing his Wikipedia profile – deleting negative references to his role in NHS scandals.

It had been alleged that Mr Burnham, Labour Health Secretary for 11 months  from June 2009, ignored requests for a public inquiry into the Mid Staffs NHS Trust and failings at 11 hospitals.

Now The Mail on Sunday has discovered one of his staff deleted references on his profile where  he was accused of ‘ignoring and suppressing information linked to the appalling standards of care’ at Mid Staffs.

The deleted Wikipedia passage also says Mr Burnham and predecessor Alan Johnson had both ‘been made aware of the issues through dozens of reports made by whistleblowers, but chose to ignore the information’.

Another deleted excerpt claims Mr Burnham was accused by a campaigner whose mother had died of failing to meet grieving relatives at Stafford hospital.

The Mail on Sunday discovered that the deletion was made from computers inside Parliament on July 1.

This is a breach of the website’s code of conduct, which discourages users editing profiles to promote their own interests.

 MP Charlotte Leslie said: ‘If Andy Burnham’s office go deleting 
anything awkward from his Wikipedia page then people are going to think 
that his first response to bad news is to cover it up.’

Mr Burnham’s office initially refused to say whether the deletion was made by them, but later said in a statement: ‘False statements on Wikipedia were drawn to the attention of a member of Andy Burnham’s staff who removed them.’

lMr Burnham claims Coalition Ministers consistently ignored warnings over hospitals with high death rates.

said that the Government had received at least 152 letters since taking office in May 2010 – yet only began taking action this January.
