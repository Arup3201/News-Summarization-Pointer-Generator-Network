Dramatic new CCTV footage shows the moment a gang of armed robbers attempted to smash their way into a jewellery store in London's West End.

Six raiders arrived outside Watches and Jewellery of Bond Street on mopeds on Monday and launched a violent attempt to get into the store.

They tried to smash their way in using an axe and a sledgehammer, before resorting to trying to ram the door with one of their mopeds.

Footage recorded by the store's CCTV camera has now been released by police, showing the force used by the gang and the speed of their botched raid.

The group arrived shortly after 11am and disappeared after less than one minute when they realised their plans were doomed to fail.

In the intervening 50 seconds, they unleashed a shocking attack on the store, riding up and down the pavement on their bikes and taking it in turns to smash the front of the shop.

One of the gang sprayed passers-by who got too close with the noxious liquid, eventually injuring a guard.

When they realise they cannot get into the store as the staff have shut the stores security gates, they scramble around the opening to the store, warding off passers-by

The attempted criminals begin to make their escape, nearly knocking over several people on the way out of the street

One of the raiders is also believed to have been carrying a handgun throughout the raid, which can be seen in the CCTV images.

Eventually the staff managed to operate the security shutters and lock the gang out, causing them to flee.

As they fled on their three mopeds, they nearly knocked over members of the public.

Nothing was stolen from the store, but a security guard remains in hospital with potentially life-changing injuries, and several thousand pounds worth of damage was done.

The incident is being investigated by Flying Squad officers of the London Metropolitan Police based at Putney, in south west London.

Anyone with information should call police on 020 8785 8655 or to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
