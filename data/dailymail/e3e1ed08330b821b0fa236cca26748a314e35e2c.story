One potential property owner is a step closer to joining Sydney's 'millionaire's club' after the opulent Mediterranean mansion of a former tobacco executive hits the market- with an expected price tag of more than $40 million.

87-89 Wolseley Road, Point Piper, looks to challenge the record held for a non-waterfront property in the affluent harbourside suburb, drawing both domestic and international attention for it's sheer size and panoramic views.

The property was last sold in 2004 to Bill Webb and his wife Marijke, who never thought they would leave after falling in love with the house they carefully renovated to reflect it's original architecture, and it being sold by Black Diamondz.

87-89 Wolseley Road, Point Piper, has hit the Sydney property market and is expected to fetch more than $40 million 

The stunning three-storey residence is set on 1900 square metres, boasting views which run from Sydney Harbour all the way down to Manly, and is one of the few properties left on the market in the close-knit suburb of Point Piper. 

The trophy house was built in 1954, commissioned by General Motors dealer Bill Stack, and redesigned in 2004 by architect Michael Suttor.

With interiors by Michael love, 'Mandalay' has been lovingly constructed to highlight the colonnaded terraces and ornate wrought iron balustrades at the heart of the property, reported Domain.

The house has reportedly been on and off the market for several years, and co-agent Bill Malouf from LJ Hooker Double Bay said that the couple are now ready to downsize after their adult children have found their own homes.

'Now that there's only two people in the house the couple are ready for something smaller,' said Mr Malouf.

'They told me that they would be leaving the property with reservations- I sold it to them a number of years ago and they said they couldn't see themselves leaving,' he said.

'But times change. It's such a huge property, just magnificent.'

The 1900-square-metre property certainly is generous, with views that run from the Sydney Opera House and Habour down to Manly and Rose Bay- a claim that not many properties can make.

The European-style villa houses six bedrooms, a five-car garage, a wine cellar and heated pool.

The lower level is almost large enough to be considered a separate apartment, and offers a private gymnasium and sauna, as well as a swimming pool and a study. 

The large, open plan kitchen boasts a built-in butler's pantry and additional staff quarters for a maid or nanny

The house is also divided into the West and East wing, offering an office, a private balcony and palatial walk-in wardrobes.  

'The property is pretty unique, and the timing is perfect to have a house like this on the market, especially with the Australian dollar doing so well in Asia,' said Mr Malouf.

The estate agent said that the house had already garnered significant international attention, including interest from the United States and several Asian clients.

'All the major trophy properties in Potts Point have sold, so there's no competition for a home like this. There's nothing like it in the area,' he said.

The house boasts views from Sydney Harbour  down to Manly, and is one of the few properties left on the market in Point Piper

'I'm expecting the sale price to be over the $40 million mark, between $45 and $47 million depending on the buying market.'  

Point Piper has seen a flurry of sales over the past few months, with another Wolsey Road property selling for a reported $39 million in November to a Chinese billionaire.

Xu Jianyin, chairman of the real estate group Evergrande, is listed as China's 15th richest man with $7 billion worth of wealth to his name 

The 56-year-old is reported to have paid about $39 million for the Villa del Mare mansion at 63-67 Wolseley Rd.
