Sliced and diced: Study say takeaway pizzas are not value for money

Britons feel they get the least value for money when purchasing birthday cards, takeaway pizzas and stamps whilst one in four cannot stand having to fork out for a colleague’s birthday celebrations.

However, good news for those in our tea-loving nation who like to sit down in front of the telly with a cuppa, the 'best value for money' list include semi-skimmed milk, kettles and flat screen televisions.

These are the results of a survey carried out amongst 2,000 Britons into which products and services gave them the most - and the least - for their wages.

It also emerged that on average, Brits feels they only get enough for their hard-earned pounds on about four in every ten purchases.

Many popular outings such as going to a football game, taking the family to a theme park or watching the latest 3D-flick in the cinema were slated by those surveyed.

Paying nearly £12 for a 3D cinema ticket was considered a rip-off as well as £43 theme park tickets and £45 to watch a premiership football match.

Pub-goers are among those displeased with what they get for their cash.

A medium glass of white wine purchased in
a pub was considered the seventh biggest rip-off and a pint of beer 
came in at number 20.

Un-happy birthday spendings: Birthday cards are Britain's biggest rip off, and adding a few quid to the birthday shindigs of a colleague was the only non-household cost which made the top-ten most hated payments

For those looking to cure their disappointment the following morning it is not looking good.

Britons consider paying £16.99 for a takeaway pizza the fourth worst rip-off.

Fortunately another Sunday morning essential – paracetamol – won the top spot as most value for money.

To weigh up the second worst - train tickets - Brits consider both travel insurance and £4 all-day bus passes good buys.

Those questioned also thought 69p for iPhone apps and broadband contracts for £18 a month were good deals.

The study also concluded that Brits hate spending their money on everyday bills and car maintenance.

Fuel, parking, car repairs and car 
insurance all made the top ten things we hate paying out for.

It also 
included council tax, electricity, water and gas, suggesting that we see
these bills as a necessary evil that we would rather avoid.

Dave Broadway, managing director of 
print and post specialists Docmail, which commissioned the study, said: 
'It’s hard times for many people at the moment and the results of the 
research show that the majority of Brits feel they aren’t getting value 
for money in many areas.

Tea-time: Two of the essentials to make a perfect brew - a kettle and milk - were considered good value for money

'People are having to be more and 
more aware of their spending day to day and squeeze the pennies further.

'That makes them reassess every purchasing decision and clearly the 
value of an item is not always in line with the cost.

He added that it is in interesting to 
see the range of areas where the worst value items can be found, saying 
it proves that Britons feel their lives are becoming increasingly 
expensive.

Mr Broadway added: “The study shows 
it’s not about how much something costs but the level of value 
represented in the price - whether that’s buying a stamp or a TV 
subscription, people are always very aware of what they are getting in 
return for their money.

'Of course, there are a number of essentials which Brits clearly feel they get a poor deal with.

'There are usually cheaper options for
everything, but it’s hard finding a balance between what you’re 
prepared to pay and the quality you expect.'
