A bookmaker suspended betting on the Queen stepping down after a large wager was placed in Windsor.

The development follows reports that the 87-year-old monarch is handing over key responsibilities to Prince Charles.

Bookmaker Coral had slashed the odds of Her Majesty stepping down before the end of the year from 3-1 to 1-2, before suspending the market yesterday.

A spokesman said: ‘The significant gamble suggests that the Queen could hand over the reins sooner rather than later.

‘With her 88th birthday approaching, the Queen has started to relinquish a number of duties to Prince Charles, leading to major speculation about the monarch’s future.’

She said bets about members of the royal family which were placed in the Windsor area were usually ‘spot on’, suggesting there may be some insider knowledge circulating.

The bookmaker’s odds were 1-20 that Prince Charles would be next on the throne while Prince William was being backed at 8-1.

The Queen is due to visit the Normandy beaches later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, along with Prince Charles, in what some claim will be her final overseas engagement.

A French government official was reported as saying: ‘We have been told this will probably be the Queen’s last official foreign visit.’

But royal aides have been quick to dismiss the claims and have stressed that the monarch is far from retiring and will continue to focus instead on ‘behind the scenes’ duties.

The movement of Charles to a more central role will allow the Queen to concentrate on her role as head of state – including hosting foreign ambassadors and state visits.

The Queen has already handed a number of responsibilities to younger members of the royal family in the last few months, including Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment.
