The young couple feared to have plunged to their deaths from a luxury cruise liner off the coast of Australia, are said to have had a heated argument on the night of the incident.

CCTV footage shows Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27, argue in the ship's casino on Wednesday, according to Sydney Herald.

It is believed that the couple then 
skipped an arranged dinner with Ms Schroder's family, who were also 
travelling on the Carnival Spirit liner.

A source told the Sydney Herald the couple frequently had short but heated fights that would last about five minutes.

'It was a common occurence between them,' said the source.

Fall: Paul Rossington, 30, and Kristen Schroder, 27 were arguing on the Carnival Spirit liner hours before they fell from the ship off the New South Wales coast

Senior police sources revealed that 
CCTV footage captures Ms Schroder fall from the ship first, with her 
paramedic boyfriend following.

Further footage shows Ms Schroder hit a lifeboat before her body hit the water.

The couple had been travelling with a group of friends and family on the Carnival Spirit liner.

The massive sea and air search for the 
pair was called off yesterday.

Authorities were said to be looking at the 
theory that Miss Schroder fell first and her panic-stricken boyfriend 
then jumped in to try to save her.

'Paul was trying to save her,' a source who asked not to be identified told the Australian Associated Press.

Security footage on the boat is said to show the pair falling overboard from the mid-deck of the boat as it travelled down the New South Wales' mid-north coast just before 9pm local time on Wednesday.

Initially police were unable to determine who had fallen into the sea first, but after the footage had been enhanced, they could see that it was estate agent Miss Schroder who plunged first from the 65ft-high deck, followed about 20 seconds later by her boyfriend.

They were reported missing 12 hours later after the boat had docked at Sydney's Circular Quay at the end of its 10-day cruise.

Staff noticed the couple had failed to collect their luggage when the rest of the 2,680 passengers disembarked.

Survival expert Dr Paul Luckin said if the couple, from Barraba, near Tamworth in NSW, had survived the impact of hitting the water, fatigue would be their biggest problem.

Dr Luckin, who advises the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said he would not expect anyone to last as long as three days after falling from a ship.

He told the Sydney Herald: 'If you're stuck in the water and constantly being hit in the face by water, that is tremendously fatiguing...

'It will certainly be under three days that you would expect somebody to survive without water in those conditions.'

Holiday: The couple was on holiday with a group of seven relatives and friends when they went missing on Wednesday night

Mr Rossington, a paramedic, and his 
girlfriend had been on holiday on the cruise around the Pacific Islands 
with a group of seven relatives and friends.

Their cabin on the ship remains sealed off while forensic officers inspect it, although the ship did set sail from Sydney on its next cruise at 6.30pm last night.

NSW police marine area commander Mark
 Hutchings said the couple's fall was not believed to be suspicious, and
 officers were inspecting the ship's CCTV footage.

He said: 'It’s very unclear, but it does depict one person going over and then a short time (later) another person going over.'

The ship was about 120km (75 miles) off the coastal town of Forster when the couple plunged into the sea.

A statement released by Carnival Cruise Lines said: 'As part of our standard protocol, a full ship search was conducted as well as examination of closed circuit video.

'There is indication from the shipboard video of what transpired.

'There is no evidence of foul play.  However, out of respect for the families, we are not going to publicly disclose the details of what occurred.'

The firm's spokesman said the rails on the cabin balconies are higher than the required standard.

CCTV: Police studying enhanced CCTV footage from the ship's cameras believe Miss Schroder fell into the sea first

Carnival Cruise Lines, operated by Miami-based Carnival Corp, has been beset by a 
series of problems and onboard crimes including power outage, rape, 
sickness and theft.

Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits.

Many passengers will have unknowingly signed Carnival's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits, while the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional distress.
