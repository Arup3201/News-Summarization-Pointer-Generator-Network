One of Britain's most powerful businesswomen has infuriated residents with plans to erect two large wind turbines - which will be a 'blot on the landscape' whilst hidden from her own view.

Dame Marjorie Scardino, the American-born chief of book publisher Pearson Plc, wants to build the two turbines in the grounds of her £2.5m country pile in Levington, near Ipswich, Suffolk.

But while Texan Dame Marjorie, the highest paid female director of a FTSE 100 company, wants the turbines to minimise the carbon footprint in the area, the two giant structures will conveniently not be visible from her property, villagers have claimed.

Instead, residents in Levington, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, say the two turbines, one of which could be 85ft tall, will be an eyesore for the rest of the small Suffolk village.

The white turbines will be around 300ft from the nearest neighbours in Levington but almost 1,000ft from the Scardinos, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Suffolk Coastal District council documents show that Dame Marjorie and her husband, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Albert Scardino, have already had one planning application for the turbines turned down last summer.

Their previous request in July last year for two steel mast 20kw turbines measuring 27.1m (89ft) was withdrawn after objections from residents.

Villagers have again objected to renewed plans by the Scardinos after arguing that the turbines will devalue house prices in Levington and the surrounding area, as well as being an eyesore in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Residents have expressed concerns that the Scardinos, who bought the countryside property seven years ago but live mostly in London, are 'riding roughshod' over the concerns of people in Levington.

Neil Downing, 37, a father-of-two whose home is just 800ft from the proposed turbine site, told the Telegraph: 'The Scardinos are not going to have to see the turbines from where they live, but we are.

'It seems they will get all the financial and carbon footprint advantages while the rest of us will get all the disadvantages and none of the benefits.

'People are worried about the noise, about the devaluation of their homes and also as this is an AONB. If this goes ahead, what other developments are we going to see here in the future?'

Other residents have expressed concerns that the turbines will be a 'blot on the landscape', after dismissing the Scardino's plans as a 'rich man's toy'.

The Scardinos bought the 18th century property in Levington in 2005, but are known to spend much of their time in London or abroad.

The Scardinos today responded by saying they are taking the project 'very seriously', and 'do not want to make out neighbours unhappy'.

Albert Scardino told MailOnline: 'We take our stewardship of this small holding very seriously and have worked diligently to maintain and sustain it.

'We recognise that the erection of small wind turbines can cause strong reactions, and they are proliferating.

'We do not want to make our neighbours unhappy. As has been the case with every aspect of our work, we will attempt to mitigate the impact on them as much as possible through our extensive programme of reforestation, hedge planting and coppice woodland development.'

Mr Scardino said the couple undergone work to improve the natural habitat around their mansion, adding that the project involves 'small scale domestic turbines'.

Dame Marjorie, 65, is one of Britain's most influential and powerful business figures, having been in charge of Pearson PLC for 15 years.

She is said to have received almost £10m last year as chief executive of Pearson, the world's largest book publisher which owns Penguin Books and the Financial Times.

In February last year Pearson announced a 28 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to £670m, which Dame Marjorie hailed as the firm's 'best year ever'.

Suffolk Coastal district council said the application for the Sardinos wind turbines would be considered at an upcoming meeting this month after receiving over 200 objections from residents, as well as an objection from the local parish council.

A spokesperson for Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty also advised recommended the Scardinos reduce the size of the tallest turbine to 15m if they plan to get approval for the project.

A spokesperson said the matter could be referred to a planning committee if there is a sufficient 'groundswell' of opposition, but stressed the final decision would come down to whether it complies with planning laws.

A spokesperson for Dame Marjorie Scardino was approached by MailOnline but did not respond to requests for comment.
