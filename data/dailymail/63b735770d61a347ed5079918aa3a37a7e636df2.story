Found dead: David Welch, 54, was reported missing on September 2 by his family in Manhattan, Kansas

The body of a missing father has been found after he was trapped in the wreckage of his car for weeks - and spent his final days writing emotional handwritten notes to his family.

David Welch, 54, vanished without a trace from his home in Kansas on September 2 and police only found his body on October 18 more than 800 miles away in a remote part of Utah.

It has now emerged that he likely fell asleep at the wheel, veered off the road and was trapped in his overturned vehicle.

Police say that he survived in the wreckage for days and possibly weeks.

They have said that he was injured and that prevented him from getting out of the vehicle, but they have not disclosed the nature of his injuries.

The car was not visible when driving on the interstate, but a hitchhiker who was walking along the remote road was the one to spot the crash site on October 18.

Utah Highway Patrol troopers found Welch trapped inside his mangled minivan at the bottom of a 50-foot ravine - with handwritten notes to his wife and four adult sons.

What's in those letters, though, is not being made public. The Welch family declined comment and the Utah Highway Patrol isn't sharing what they call very personal.

Horrific: The car was found on October 18 when a hitchhiker was walking along the remote stretch of highway and spotted the car that was not visible from the road

The discovery brought a tragic end to a
difficult several weeks for Welch's family that began on September 2 
when they reported him missing from his home in Manhattan, Kansas.

The
family said Welch, a retired salesman, left in a 2000 Pontiac Montana 
without telling anyone where he was going - according to Riley County Police 
spokesman Matt Droge.

Over 
the next several days, police did several 
searches of the area that came up empty. Welch was put in 
the national missing persons database.

As the days went on, the family struggled with not knowing what happened.

They posted missing signs around the city and started a Facebook page to bring attention to the search, Droge said.

On the Facebook page Find Dave Welch they asked people to drive two extra blocks each day in hopes of finding him somewhere in Manhattan.Â 

Family: Investigators are still at a loss for why Welch left his seemingly happy family life, seen at left with his wife Kelly and at right with one of his grandchildren

Heartbreaking: Police found handwritten notes addressed to his wife and children in the car when they found Mr Welch's body in the vehicle on October 18

On October 17, the day before he was found, there was a post written directly to Welch, perhaps in hopes he might read them.

'Dear
Dave, it has been seven weeks since you left. Your wife, children and 
grandchildren miss you more than the sky is high. Your classmates and 
friends are concerned for your health and want to help. As we sit at 
home tonight with tears welling up; our hearts aching, we wonder where 
you are. We only pray that you see this message and ask God to bring you
home soon. We love you!'

Investigators believe Welch fell asleep at the wheel of his minivan as he approached a curve on Interstate 70 in eastern Utah around September 3, Riches said.

His minivan sped off the road and went airborne, smashing into the side of the ravine. It came to rest upside down, resting on the passenger side, he said.

Evidence suggests Welch was injured and unable to get out of the van, Riches said. The medical examiner has not yet determined his cause of death.

Even if we would have been able to get out, the nearest city, Green River, was about 50 miles west.

Thousands of cars sped by on the nearby interstate without a clue - Welch's van couldn't be seen from the highway, Riches said.

He may never have been found if not for the hitchhiker walking on the side of the road.

'It is very desolate,' Patrol trooper Gary Riches said.

Long way from home: Welch was reported missing on September 2 and investigators believe he crashed sometime the next day nearly 836 miles away

They believe he survived for days, maybe weeks, keeping a journal and writing notes to family in Kansas.

In his obituary, the family said Welch was a salesman at Pepsi Co. and later Frito-Lay until he retired in 2009.

He liked landscaping his yard, being outdoors and scuba diving in the ocean. He had been married to his wife, Kelly Welch, an assistant professor at Kansas State University, for 31 years.

He was looking forward to the upcoming birth of his second grandchild, the obituary said.

It remains a mystery why he left his home state in the first place, said authorities in Utah and Kansas.

'I wish it would have turned out better for the family,' said Droge. 'It was an unpleasant turn of events for them.'
