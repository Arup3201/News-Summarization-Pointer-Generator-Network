When Dr Michael Mosley launched the Fast Diet two years ago, he was confident that it was a great way to lose weight and improve health.

But even he could not have been prepared for how the diet would take off, with hundreds of thousands of people around the globe successfully losing weight and transforming their vitality and wellbeing.

While the basics haven’t changed — the aim is still to cut calories by three-quarters on two days of the week and eat normally the rest of the time — this week he and his co-author, Mimi Spencer, launch an exciting new Fast Diet book.

The Fast Diet is simple: cut you calorie intake by three-quarters on two days of the week and eat normally the rest of the time

It includes new recipes for mouth-watering diet day meals that both men and women will love — making it easy to get in shape alongside your partner, as long as you remember that women should eat no more than 500 calories on a diet day, while for men it’s 600 calories.

In the book, Dr Mosley also explores the part exercise has to play in health, longevity and weight loss. Don’t worry, he’s not suggesting you embark on a gruelling regime. You won’t have to join an expensive gym, either.

The truth is that even if you don’t exercise, you’ll see many benefits from fasting two days a week.

However, research shows that 12 minutes of exercise a week can significantly boost results.

Yes, that’s right — just 12 minutes a week. And here, in the final part of our Fast Diet series, we’ll show you how to do it.

In one study highlighted in the new book, participants were asked to combine 5:2 fasting with three short bursts of high-intensity training (HIT) on three separate days each week.

The result was an average weight loss of 4.6kg (10lb) over 12 weeks, all of it fat. One dieter on the programme lost an impressive 12.6kg (2st).

Another study found that those who combined intermittent fasting with exercise (40 minutes three times a week) lost twice as much over 12 weeks as those who only did the fasting. The good news is that you don’t need to exercise for anything like 40 minutes to see benefits.

Exercising fast-style couldn’t be simpler. Forget running or cycling further, research shows that you gain the most benefit by increasing the intensity of your exercise, not the length of time that you do it.

If you push yourself to the max for even a few seconds, there’s no need — according to Dr Mosley — to exercise for very long at all.

So whether you choose jogging, cycling, swimming or just trotting up and down a flight of stairs, think short, sharp bursts.

Push the intensity as much as you can for 20 (building to 30) seconds, then slow the pace right down for a minute or so, and repeat.

If you do it right, there’s no need to be active for more than four minutes in total.

Find time for three of these mini-sessions each week, and you will be increasing the effectiveness of the diet and boosting your health.

It doesn’t matter whether you exercise on fast days or ordinary days, although studies show you will burn more fat if you exercise on a fast day. You may choose to build fast exercise into your ordinary fitness regime (Dr Mosley builds sprints into his daily cycle home from work). If that doesn’t appeal, rest assured that you can get all the benefit you need in just a total of 12 minutes a week.

Start off with a couple of minutes of gentle pedalling, jogging or swimming. When you feel ready, speed up fast and work your body as hard as you can, maintain that intensity for 20 seconds, then slow down and allow your body to recover for a minute by returning to an easy pace.

Then repeat the intense ‘sprint’ for 20 seconds before slowing right down again until your heart rate has returned to normal.

If you are very unfit or have never tried this sort of training before, slowly build up the sprints from two lots of ten seconds.

Then, once you have mastered two 20-second sprints, add a third before your final cool-down. The whole ‘workout’ should take no longer than four minutes, and should be repeated three times a week.

When you are comfortable with three 20-second sprints, move up to 30 seconds of intense activity (the extra ten seconds lasts a lot longer than you think). Start with two lots of 30 seconds and increase to three bursts of activity with a 1-2 minute recovery in between them.

Jogging

If you are new to running, go for a brisk walk, breaking into a jog for your timed 20 or 30-second ‘sprint’ intervals.

As your stamina improves, your ‘sprints’ can be faster or done up hills to intensify the workout. Just make sure you perform three sprints each time.

If you are using a treadmill, put the machine at a permanent 1 per cent incline and increase the speed (and incline) as quickly as you can for each timed sprint.

Stair climbing

A great activity for bottom and leg toning which intensifies the health benefits of jogging by forcing your body to work against gravity.

Find a stairwell in a building with at least four full floors. Ensure your whole foot lands on each step (to avoid straining the Achilles’ tendon in the heel) and walk back down during recovery periods.

After a gentle warm-up (walk up and down a couple of flights), sprint hard up the stairs as fast as you can for 20 (building to 30) seconds, then slowly recover as you walk back down. Repeat three times.

Cycling

Build intensity into the ride by intermittently switching to a higher gear and cycling very hard uphill for three 20 and then 30-second bursts. Freewheel back down between bursts to catch your breath.

Exercise bike

Spend a few minutes pedalling gently, then ramp up the RPM setting to 90 and pedal as hard and fast as you possibly can for 20 seconds before freewheeling for a few minutes to get your breath back. Repeat two more times. You can build RPM to 110 as you get stronger and increase the sprint times from 20 to 30 seconds.

Swimming

Challenge yourself to put three fast laps into your routine, but make sure you allow yourself time to catch your breath in between. A 25m length at full pelt is comparable to sprinting for around 30-40 seconds.
