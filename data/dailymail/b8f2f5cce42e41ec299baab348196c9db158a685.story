Real Madrid’s 16-year-old £2.3million signing Martin Odegaard confirmed on Thursday that the prospect of working with Zinedine Zidane turned his head away from the Premier League and towards the European champions.

The Norwegian teenager, who was presented at the club’s training ground, is on a basic £40,000-a-week for his first half-season but can double that with bonuses.

He chose Madrid despite visiting Liverpool and Arsenal on a whistle-stop tour of some of Europe’s biggest clubs.

Age: 16 (D.O.B. 17/12/98)

Born: Drammen, Norway

Position: Attacking midfielder

Clubs: Stromsgodset (2014-15), Real Madrid (2015-

Appearances: 24

Goals: 5

International appearances: 3

International goals: 0 

Odegaard, who will train with the Real Madrid first and second teams, said: ‘It’s a big advantage for me that Real Madrid have a B team playing in a very competitive league and are managed by someone who was one of the best players in the world.’

Madrid B coach Zidane showed Odegaard around the Valdebebas training complex when he visited the Spanish capital at the start of the year. ‘Madrid had the best conditions for me to develop and my aim now is to become the best player I can,’ said Odegaard.

The attacking midfielder had previously said Liverpool were his dream club but believes he will develop better at the Bernabeu.

Liverpool could have done little more to charm the teenager when they invited him over in December. The then 15-year-old from Stromsgodset and his father, Hans Erik, were given a tour of Anfield and taken for dinner in Liverpool where they met one of his idols, Philippe Coutinho.

He trained with the first team the following day and manager Brendan Rodgers told him he hoped he would see him again.

That hope was forlorn. Odegaard had similar trips to Arsenal, Manchester United and City but, as most players find, when Real Madrid come calling they are hard to refuse.

Real director Emilio Butragueno admitted that Odegaard could even make his debut for the first team this season although he would first and foremost be at Zidane’s disposal as Real Madrid’s B team ‘Castilla’ try to win promotion back to Spain’s second tier.

‘I feel very much at home,’ said Odegaard in a press conference in which he gave answers only in Norwegian. Already a full Norway international, he speaks only his native tongue along with limited English and no Spanish.

Asked if he preferred Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he gave the diplomatic response: ‘Right now, I prefer Ronaldo.’ According to Barcelona’s sports paper El Mundo Deportivo he is already playing the political game, deleting his previous tweets praising Messi.

Odegaard’s heavily incentivised contract means he will pocket £80,000 a week only by picking up all his bonuses, but even his basic £40,000 is a striking figure for someone who did not turn 16 until the week before Christmas.

Real are among the clubs who have paid big money for youngsters in the past — and had their fingers burned. In 2010 they signed 18-year-old Sergio Canales for £4m but he never became a first-team regular and is now with David Moyes at Real Sociedad. On Saturday, Real face Bebe — signed as a 19-year-old by Sir Alex Ferguson for £7.4m five years ago and now on loan at Cordoba from Benfica.

But there is firm belief that Odegaard will be a success and Thursday’s high-profile presentation saw Real basking in the glory of having beaten many of Europe’s top clubs to sign him.

They will take special pleasure in having denied Barcelona. Banned by UEFA from making any signings until 2016, Barca could not follow up their own interest.

While Barcelona signed Leo Messi aged 13 and also brought Neymar to Europe, Real’s record for producing world-class players is not as good as their record for buying them. Odegaard is their chance to change that.

He will go straight into the B team for what is left of the season in the hope he can help win promotion. They are currently joint-leaders of one of Spain’s regional third divisions. If they can win it they will play off for a place in the second tier.

If the B team go up, Odegaard will spend most of next season training with the first team while playing matches for the B side. If they miss out, Odegaard could stay with the first team squad... his father insisting on an assurance that his son will not play third-tier football next season.

Odegaard Snr, who will now take a coaching job with Madrid, has clearly not just taken the deal with the best financial package. He made sure Madrid promised to turn their boy into a top-flight footballer at the same pace that Arsene Wenger, Pep Guardiola and Brendan Rodgers would have done at Arsenal, Bayern Munich or Liverpool.

Madrid will need to be as good as their word.
