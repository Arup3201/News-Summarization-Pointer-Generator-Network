Lukas Podolski was all smiles as he took part in his first Inter Milan training session since joining on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season.

The 29-year-old was put through his paces on Monday by boss Roberto Mancini at their Appiano Gentile base as the Italian giants prepared for their daunting trip to Serie A leaders Juventus on Tuesday night.

And despite only joining his new side over the weekend, Podolski appears to have already created some bonds with his new team-mates.

Midfielder Rene Krhin is one to have warmed to the Germany international as the pair were seen laughing and joking in between the session, while defender Nemanja Vidic would have been a familiar face for Podolski after the pair's Premier League encounters for Manchester United and Arsenal.

Podolski will be hoping his training and performances will impress his new employers with a view to making his loan move permanent in the summer.

Upon his arrival in Milan's Linate Airport on Friday, the forward was mobbed by Inter fans ahead of completing his move to the San Siro outfit.

Podolski wore a scarf with the club's famous black and blue colours as he signed autographs and posed for pictures before declaring his excitement at the opportunity to play for the Italian giants.

Speaking to Sky Italia, he said: 'I spoke to Mancini and think he’s a great coach. He wanted me and I’m happy to be here. I know Serie A, it’s a very competitive league.

'I want to help the team get into the Champions League. Do I have a message for the fans? I am happy, Forza Inter and we hope to have a great season.' 

Inter sit currently 11th in Serie A with 21 points after 16 games - 18 behind Juventus.
