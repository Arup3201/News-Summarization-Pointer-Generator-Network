The Cornish pasty would lose its legal protection and faces being swamped by American imports under a transatlantic trade deal, a German minister has warned.

Celebrated regional foods like cheese, cider, clotted cream, seafood and meat are protected under European law to stop cheap copies being passed off as being from specific regions.

But German farming minister Christian Schmidt suggested the rules would not continue if the trade agreement with the United States goes ahead.

There are currently 62 British products covered by the EU Protected Food Name scheme which highlights regional and traditional foods whose authenticity and origin can be guaranteed.

It gives legal protection against imitation throughout the EU.

Mr Schmidt warned that the protections would be eroded if European markets are opened up to American imitators under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

He told Spiegel magazine: 'If we want to take advantage of the opportunities of free trade with the huge American market, we can no longer have every type of sausage and cheese each protected as a speciality.

To be a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'

While the likes of Cumberland sausage and Melton Mowbray pork pies are unlikely to be copied by US firms, the Cornish pasty was taken across the Atlantic by copper miners and there are now versions sold in parts of the US.

Cornish pasty producers insist there is no question of giving up their legal status.

Ruth Huxley, the managing director of Cornwall Food and Drink and spokesman for the Cornish Pasty Association, told MailOnline: 'It would be fair to say that the suggestion that there should be an element of compromise over the protection of names is not something we agree with.

'We would not really say there should be any compromise.'

She insisted that the protected name status was not to stop people making pasties, but to ensure they did not call them Cornish if they were made elsewhere.

To be a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'.

It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty.

Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper'  

The European Commission said: 'There is no question of weakening the existing protection for recognised EU products.

'In the framework of TTIP as of any other trade agreement negotiation, the goal of the Commission is to extend the protection certain products already get on the EU market to the concerned market.'

Some American food firms want the protections dropped on products which have become common in the US. 

A government spokesman said: “TTIP will provide a valuable opportunity for the UK food and drink industries to promote their products in the US market worth millions to our economy."

"We want to ensure the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) promotes and opens markets for high quality British produce.”
