England's Under 21 defensive duo Luke Shaw and Eric Dier took time out between their Euro 2015 play-off clashes against Croatia by trying their luck at table tennis instead. 

And it seems Manchester United's £31.5million teenager got the better of the Tottenham Hotspur youngster as Shaw took to Twitter to rub it in his Young Lions team-mate's nose.

'Never mind mate, table tennis is just not for you,' Shaw wrote along with the snap of Dier retrieving his ping pong.
