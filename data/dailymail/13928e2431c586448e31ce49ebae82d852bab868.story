A truck driver has won $650,000 on a lottery scratchcard just one day after losing his wife to a heart attack - and remarked 'Everything happens for a reason'.

Timothy McDaniel, 55, bought a winning $1 Scratcher at the College Villa Market in Marysville on Sunday - his wife died on Saturday.

'I think she just kind of sent me this 
money so I could continue taking care of the (grand) kids,' McDaniel told the California Lottery.

'I didn’t expect to win. I bought three Scratchers, a $5, a $2 and a $1. I saw it said ‘LIFE’ on there so I showed my nephew. I was like, ‘Paulie, what does it say!?’

'He said, ‘I don’t know Uncle Tim. What’s it say?’ We were like no that ain’t real…that ain’t right. But then he read it again and I said, "That’s real! We won. Yahoo!"' McDaniel recalled.

McDaniel decided to take the cash option, which means he will receive a lump sum of $375,000 before taxes.

McDaniel - who has won $200 on the lottery before - said he hopes to buy a house and a new truck and put the rest in the bank.

'Everything happens for a reason, and this is the break I needed,' McDaniel said.

'I'm going to keep on working and living my life the same I always have.

'The only difference is I have a big family, and now if anybody needs anything, I can help them out.'
