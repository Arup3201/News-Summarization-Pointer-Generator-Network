A neighborhood watch captain with an extensive criminal history has been named the primary suspect in at least one of 10 rapes committed in a Dallas neighborhood since June – and he’s now on the run.

Van Dralen Dixson, 38, of Dallas, was accused of at least one of the rapes after his DNA sample matched that of the attacker, police have yet to name him to eight other attacks they say were committed by a serial rapist, but are testing his DNA against that of the attacker. An additional attack Saturday morning has yet to be linked to the other nine, but the investigation is ongoing.

All 10 attacks have happened in and around the Fair Park neighborhood of South Dallas, an area rife with crime and homelessness. They took place during roughly the same hours Mr Dixson is said to have patrolled the area, armed and in a car matching one described by all the victims. The neighborhood watch association was unaware of his prior criminal history.

On the run: Van Dralen Dixson, 38, fled after authorities took a sample of his DNA while investigating a rape - he matched the attacker and is now off the grid

Mr Dixson disappeared shortly after providing investigators with a DNA sample, dropping his children with a relative and ditching his car nearby, officials said. Victims have all described a car similar to the 2003 Saturn owned by the suspect, according to officials.

‘The results provided a positive DNA match for a suspect,’ Dallas police spokesperson Jeff Cotner said during a weekend news conference. ‘Officers are working diligently to locate the suspect.’

Though not linked to the other attacks, authorities are now awaiting test results from specimens collected in the other attacks.

‘We are still awaiting laboratory results on the evidence submitted for testing from other cases,’ said Mr Cotner.

A wanted man: Dallas Police announced Dixson as the main suspect in at least one of 10 rapes committed in Dallas' Fair Park neighborhood during a weekend news conference

In addition to announcing that a warrant has been issued for his arrest on one charge of aggravated sexual assault, Mr Cotner said there is also a $15,000 reward for information leading to Mr Dixson’s capture.

Once captured, he will be subject to a $1million bond, Mr Cotner added.

As a neighborhood watch captain with the Mill City Community Association, Mr Dixson was responsible only to inform residents of upcoming meetings, but often patrolled the area after dark, while armed, locals told the Dallas Morning News.

‘His responsibility was to go around and make people aware of the association,’ association president Alendra Lyons told the paper.

All attacks occurred between midnight and 6am, the paper noted. Kym Montgomery, the youth pastor at Mr Dixson's church, was planning to confront the missing man about a comment his six-year-old daughter made while at church complaining she was 'tired of being the baby sitter,' she told the Morning News, noting that the girl had explained she was often left home along with her three siblings.

'I was going to ask him about it, but I 
didn’t get to,’ Montgomery told the paper, ‘and now the puzzle is coming
 together because he was gone and she was up. She had to baby-sit.’

Run-down: Locals described the neighborhood as run-down and prone to crime

Neighbors were in disbelief over the accusations.

One neighbor told CBS DFW that Mr Dixson was a ‘quiet guy that kind of kept to himself’ and often walked the streets.

Another told the station that she ‘wouldn’t have thought it was him’ after saying that she ‘felt like whoever it was, it was somebody that was familiar with the neighbourhood.’

Described at a good father and a religious man by one relative, a youth pastor at Mr Dixson’s church painted a very different picture of the accused rapist.

Montgomery described Mr Dixson to the Morning News as an angry man who made paranoid accusations against the family of his ex-wife. The minister noticed Mr Dixson’s car parked across the street from the church, an unusual occurrence.

‘I thought it was strange,’ Montgomery told the paper. ‘Nobody parks across the street. It’s a small church, and we all park there together.’

Vulnerable: Locals also told Dallas media that the attacker is likely taking advantage of the large homeless population, with homeless women particularly vulnerable to such attacks because they have no where to hide

Dixson is well-known to local law enforcement, having been arrested as recently as last month for deadly conduct after pointing a gun at someone four weeks ago, according to NBC DFW.

He provided officials with an address he hasn’t lived at for two years when taken into custody, according to the station.

‘He is still getting mail here, from lawyers, my girlfriend was sending it back,’ the home’s current resident said. Explaining that he's met Mr Dixson, the man then expressed his disbelief before adding 'you never know.'

High crime: The Fair Park area is also prone to robberies, assaults and car thefts, according to SpotCrime

Criminal activity is rampant in the neighborhood surrounding Fair Park, site of the Texas State Fair set to begin later this month, according to SpotCrime. There is a high incidence of robbery, assault and theft, in addition to this summer's 10 sexual assaults. A crime rate heat map from Trulia covers the majority of the neighborhood in various shades of red - indicating high incidences of crime.

Locals interviewed by Dallas media suspected Mr Dixson was taking advantage of the run-down area's high population of homeless, attacking women that are vulnerable because they have nowhere to hide.

Mr Dixson’s lengthy arrest history includes convictions for aggravated robbery, evading arrest and resisting arrest, according to authorities. The accused rapist was also arrested in 1992 for aggravated sexual assault and making a terroristic threat, but those charges were dropped, officials said.
