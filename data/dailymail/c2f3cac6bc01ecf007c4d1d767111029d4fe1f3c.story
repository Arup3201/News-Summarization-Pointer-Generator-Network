She is the schoolgirl baking sensation who has to fit her cake-making around her homework.

But it seems Great British Bake Off contestant Martha Collison is starting to feel the heat in the kitchen.

The 17-year-old – who is the BBC1 show’s youngest ever competitor – was reduced to tears on last night’s episode after finding herself at the receiving end of Mary Berry’s withering criticism.

It seems Great British Bake Off contestant Martha Collison is starting to feel the heat in the kitchen. The 17-year-old - who is the BBC1 show's youngest ever competitor - was reduced to tears on last night's episode after finding herself at the receiving end of Mary Berry's withering criticism

Miss Collison clearly struggled from the outset when she and the other remaining contestants were asked to bake some custard tarts

She did her best to produce a pistachio, apricot and honey version

The show is still recovering from last week’s ‘bingate’ scandal, when bearded competitor Iain Watters threw away his baked Alaska amid claims it had been ‘sabotaged’ by his rival Diana Beard.

Mrs Beard subsequently accused producers of artificially heightening the tension of the episode to make her look like a villain.

She and Mr Watters are no longer in the competition, after he was eliminated and she was forced to withdraw following a fall.

But last night’s episode will do nothing to quell accusations that the BBC is seeking to make the gentle format more dramatic in a quest for higher ratings.

Miss Collison clearly struggled from the outset when she and the other remaining contestants were asked to bake some custard tarts.

She did her best to produce a pistachio, apricot and honey version. But judges Miss Berry and Paul Hollywood were scathing in their assessments, not least because she had committed the show’s cardinal sin and produced a ‘soggy bottom’ on her tart.

Mrs Berry, 79, said: ‘The first thing when you look at it is it needs a shine. A lovely glaze of some sort. It looks as though that pastry is not quite done underneath. I think the consistency looking at it should be a little bit firmer.’

Mr Hollywood, 48, added: ‘There’s a lot of moisture there, isn’t there. A lot of wetness coming through from those apricots. I’m not convinced about the flavour.

Miss Collison soon cheered up when she won the next challenge, which was to produce a set of 'mini pear pies'

Despite admitting she had 'absolutely not a clue' what she was doing, she easily beat her much older competitors. This time she grinned for the cameras and said: 'I feel amazing coming first'

'It’s quite tart, apricot, for me, in the custard.’

Miss
 Collison, who was sitting her AS-Levels at her school in Berkshire when
 the episode was filmed in the spring, began to well up as the judges 
moved on to the next contestant and praised his ‘perfect’ pastry.

And she was unable to stop herself from crying throughout the post-challenge interview, when she said: ‘I guess it’s just hard when you spend two and a half hours making something. For them to kind of hate it is quite hard. And it hasn’t happened to me yet.’

Despite admitting she had ‘absolutely not a clue’ what she was doing, she easily beat her much older competitors.

This time she grinned for the cameras and said: ‘I feel amazing coming first. This morning was weepy Martha who made a rubbish custard tart, and now I’ve completely forgotten about that and it’s just amazing.’

Thanks to her strong improvement throughout the episode, Miss Collison escaped elimination. Instead, Scotsman Norman Caler, 67, was sent home after Miss Berry criticised his ‘crumbly’ haggis pie.

Last year, Bake Off contestant Ruby Tandoh was accused of bursting into tears whenever she wanted the judges’ sympathy. After a string of tearful performances she was knocked out in the final, and later accused her critics of ‘lazy mysogyny’.
