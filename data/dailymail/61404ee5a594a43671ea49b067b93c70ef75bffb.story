An art school student triggered a terror alert in central London today after leaving a bomb-like backpack - complete with trailing wires - at a college.

Students from Central Saint Martins were forced to flee the art school's campus in Back Hill, Clerkenwell, after the suspect package was reported to police.

The 'art project' was thought to have been deliberately placed in reception by a student as part of an installation.

 terror response vehicles - already on high alert prior to the London 2012 Olympic
 games - rushed to the scene and evacuated the building while
 the surrounding streets were blocked off.

Once it was established the backpack was a hoax, the student - named as Young Choo - was given a stern talking to by police.

A Scotland 
Yard spokesman told MailOnline: 'We responded to reports of a suspect 
package at about 1.30pm at Central Saint Martins college campus on Back
 Hill.

'Several people were evacuated from 
the building before it was found to be non-suspicious. Words of advice 
were given to the student.'

Choo - an American 'summer study 
abroad' student - said she left the package as part of the projectÂ  
titled 'Intervention' before going to have lunch.

The convincing 'bomb' consisted of a black rucksack wrapped in red tape and featured a canister and trailing wires.

When she returned to the scene, she was questioned by police before being made 
to dismantle the package in a bin.

She was not charged with any offence and was allowed to leave the scene.

Choo said she is studying Contemporary Fine Art Practice, a course which the college website describes as 'an interdisciplinary fine art 
course that will provide an innovative and experimental approach to the 
making and development of your work'.

Central Saint Martins college was unavailable for comment.
