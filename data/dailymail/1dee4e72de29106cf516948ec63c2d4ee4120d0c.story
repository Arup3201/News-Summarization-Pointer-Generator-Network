Jack Rodwell says he would guard against advising a young English player to sign for Manchester City and admits his move cost him a place at the World Cup.

The 23-year-old is starting afresh with Sunderland this week having ended a frustrating two-year stay at the Etihad.

Rodwell made just seven league starts for City following a £12million transfer from Everton and has revealed his mind was long since made up on quitting the club. 

Mistake? Jack Rodwell believes his move to Manchester City scuppered his chances at playing for England

And the midfielder says he would be cautious were an English prospect to seek his advice on moving to a club such as City.

'Personally, I would probably say don’t sign now,' said the £10m man.

'I’d say get as much football as you can, but you just never know - you could go there, do really well and be winning league titles and everything.

'I would never say “don’t sign”, I would just say weigh up your options and ask yourself if you want to be playing regularly.'

Out of favour: The 23-year-old midfielder struggled to nail down a first team place under Manuel Pellegrini

Rodwell was rated as one of the best talents in the world at 16 years of age when he became Everton's youngest-ever European player.

Three England caps followed but he hasn't appeared since the 2-2 draw with Brazil in Rio last summer.

Rodwell is keen to stress that he was fit for 47 of City's 57 matches last season but simply was not selected by Manuel Pellegrini.

And that, he argues, robbed him of the chance of a return to Brazil as part of Roy Hodgson's squad.

Bad experince: Rodwell would advise young English players not to sign for Manchester City

'If I’d been playing regularly for the last two years, I believe I probably would have been up there (as one of best players in the world),' he said.

'I certainly think I would have been playing at the World Cup. It’s just not worked out over the last two seasons and that’s why I am here (at Sunderland) now.'

Rodwell had several options over the close-season but, after a meeting with Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, he was sold on Wearside.

'The manager just came across really well, he’s someone who has done it at the top level and he knows what the players need,' he went on.

'He’s obviously got good man-management skills, he said I’d be playing every week as well and that’s the main thing for me.'
