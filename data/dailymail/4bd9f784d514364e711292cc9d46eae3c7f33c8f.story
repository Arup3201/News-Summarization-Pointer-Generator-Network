Laid out in the hot sun after being killed and then dumped in a rubbish pile, these are the stray dogs of Karachi which have been rounded up and culled.  

The Pakistani city began a mass cull of the stray dogs after authorities became alarmed about their increasing numbers.

Municipal workers were seen laying out out the bodies of the dead animals on the road after they were killed.

Municipal workers in the Pakistani city of Karachi lay out the bodies of the stray dogs that have been culled as part of a new campaign 

City officials became concerned about the number of stray dogs in Karachi and say they were prompted to take action 

They were then thrown and dumped into a truck ready for them to be taken away and be disposed of.  

It comes after they were rounded up and exterminated after being classed as strays after being found wandering the streets.

The increasing number of unwanted dogs in Karachi prompted the city officials to act and they decided to launch the culling campaign.

The campaign follows a similar scheme in Lahore, where stray dogs are culled in order to keep citizens safe from dog biting incidents.

Pakistan is one of several that is still to eliminate rabies, meaning a bite from an infected dog could be deadly 

Pakistan is one of several countries that is still to eliminate rabies, meaning that receiving a bite from an infected dog could be deadly.

The disease affects the central nervous system of most warm-blooded animals.

According to the World Health Organisation few activities are underway to try to eliminate the infection in Pakistan, meaning people are at risk from rabid dogs.

They add that culling alone will not eliminate the threat of rabies as there is no evidence to suggest it reduces the spread of the disease.

Last year, officials in Russia came under fire after it was reported that the city of Sochi had hired a private company to kill as many stray dogs as possible before the Winter Olympics.

After being killed, the dogs are then loaded and piled on the back of a truck ready for their bodies to be disposed of

A company was said to have been tasked with using poison and traps to cull the dogs before tourists and competitors descended for the Games' opening ceremony.

Russia’s stray dog problem appears to stem from decades of animals being dumped on the streets when their owners realise they can no longer afford to keep them.

These dogs then breed among themselves, giving rise to a population of animals that have never been properly domesticated.
