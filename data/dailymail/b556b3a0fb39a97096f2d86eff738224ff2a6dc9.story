A mugger was thwarted and jailed thanks to two postal workers who chased him through the streets after hearing his victim's cries for help.

Drug addict Daniel Hall, 33, snatched a woman's bag after she got off a bus in Plymouth, Devon.

But the 42-year-old victim's cries were heard by Royal Mail workers Martin Harris, 49, and Sharon O'Connor, 38, who were driving past in their mail van.

They chased up with the thief, who flung down the bag before making his escape. He was arrested just a few hours later because of the detailed   description the two postal workers gave police.

The father-of-one, who has more than 29 previous convictions, began an eight month jail sentence this week after admitting robbery at Plymouth Crown   Court.

Mr Harris and Ms O'Connor described how they were doing their morning round on January 30 when they heard the victim shouting for help.

Mother-of-three Sharon said: 'The man was running towards us and we could see he had something.

As we were watching we could hear the woman shouting "he   took my bag".  'We looked at each other and I just put my foot down and went after him.

'I knew we could cut him off at the top of the lane if we were quick enough. We did not have time to think, the adrenaline took over.'

Once Hall was cornered, Mr Harris leapt out and demanded he hand over the bag.

He said: 'I jumped out of the van and asked him to give the bag back as politely as I could. He hesitated so then I asked him again more forcibly and he   threw it at me before he ran off.

'I took the bag down to the lady and she saw that no money had been taken and she was saying, "thank you so much".

'She was shaken up but she gave me a hug and was very happy.'

The court heard Hall of Devonport, Plymouth, had 29 previous convictions and had been on drugs since he was a teenager.

His lawyer said he was expecting his second child but Recorder Simon Foster said he had choice but to send him to jail.

Mr Harris, who has been a postman for 12 years, said he would do the same again if he saw a defenceless woman being targeted.

He said: 'They have started calling us Batman and Robin at work and saying the crime rate is going to go down on our patch.

'I just did not want this kind of person to get away with it. He has mugged some defenceless woman which is not the toughest thing to do.

'It is only afterwards that you think, well anything could have happened.'
