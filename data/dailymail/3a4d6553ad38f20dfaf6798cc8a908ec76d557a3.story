Young Bode Bierdneau has been hailed a hero after risking his own life to save his dad's.

When his father John Taylor Bierdneau crashed his snowmobile in an isolated part of Lake Tahoe ski resort in California, breaking his leg, the nine-year-old jumped into action.

Bode tried digging his dad out of the snow as fast as he could, before riding for miles on his snowmobile without a cellphone or map to find help.

'I was pretty nervous and it was just a lot of pressure on me I didn't know where to go and it was really hard,' Bode told ABC7.

'I was just really hoping he would be OK.'

The fourth grader from Marin County stayed calm, eventually stumbling on a tour group with an emergency radio. From there he led rescuers to his dad.

Bierdneau was flown to hospital with a broken leg, but family members say he is on the mend.

Tisha Shaw, Bierdneau's wife and Bode's mom, said emergency crews told her what her son did was incredible.

'I was so upset, but then I thought he is such a calm kid, he is so grounded, he is such a hero, he saved his dad's life, does he know he saved his dad's life,' Shaw said.

When asked if he knew he was a hero, Bode responded, 'Um, yeah.'
