Great Britain's success at London 2012 continued today, with sailor Ben Ainslie and tennis star Andy Murray striking gold and other top athletes winning medals.

Ainslie became the greatest sailor in modern Olympic history by winning gold at his fourth Games in a row, while Murray won the men's singles final against Roger Federer.

There were silver medals for runner Christine Ohuruogu and Ainslie's sailing team-mates Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson, as well as gymnast Louis Smith who came second in the pommel horse event.

Ohuruogu, 28, who was raised less than one mile from the Olympic Stadium, was seeking to retain the Olympic title she won in Beijing in 2008 - and she only narrowly missed out on gold.

She was in seventh place in the women's 400 metres coming off the final bend, but a customary burst down the home straight saw her overhaul all but one of her rivals to clinch silver.

The race was won for the U.S. by Sanya Richards-Ross in 49.55 seconds.

Ohuruogu ran a season's best time of 49.70, beating DeeDee Trotter of the U.S. into third by two hundredths of a second.

Smith missed out on gold in the gymnastics by the narrowest margin after the overall score on the cards was tied with Hungary's Krisztian Berki.

Both athletes scored 16.066, but the 
Hungarian was awarded the gold for a fractionally higher execution 
score. GB teammate Max Whitlock scored 15.600 to claim bronze.

It
 was the second medal of the Games for both Smith, 23, and Whitlock, 19,
 who also won bronze with their teammates in the group all around 
competition on Tuesday.

Smith said getting silver was an 'unbelievable' feeling.

Asked how he would celebrate, he said: 'I cannot wait to go out and have a drink and have a McDonald's.'

Another British athlete to win a medal today was cyclist Ed Clancy, who took bronze in the men's omnium event in the velodrome.

And
 Murray went on to win a second medal at Wimbledon, as he and partner 
Laura Robson lost narrowly in the mixed doubles tennis final.

They took their places on the podium only hours after Ainslie won gold at the sailing event at Weymouth.

Ainslie
 had raged about the conduct of his rivals in earlier stages of the Finn
 class, but he took revenge in style in front of thousands of fans on 
the Dorset coast.

He had accused his opponents of teaming up 
against him, leading him to warn: 'They've made me angry and you don't 
want to make me angry.'

After his win, he told the BBC: 'This was the time to do it, in front of a home crowd.

'It's just been an amazing experience this Olympics and I can tell you that listening to a crowd like that makes a difference.'

He also said he would be very surprised if he competed in Rio 2016, adding it had been the hardest couple of weeks of his life.

Ainslie's gold was the 
second sailing medal of the day after defending Olympic champions Percy and Simpson took silver in the Star class.

The two British sailors were denied a
 second straight gold after finishing eighth in the final race of their 
event, with Sweden's Frederik Loof and Max Salminen winning and 
clinching the title.

Team GB overall finished the Men's 
Star sailing event on 34 points, two behind Sweden, with Brazil's Robert
 Scheidt and Bruno Prada taking bronze with 40 points.

Percy,
 who won gold with Simpson at the same event in Beijing four years ago, 
told BBC Sport: 'We tried our hardest, but it wasn't to be.'

Clancy had been lying fifth with one round left in the six-round men's omnium cycling event.

But he rose to third after a patriotic home crowd cheered him on in the final discipline, the 1km time trial.

He said: 'I thought it would be fourth place and a bit of disappointment.

'That's why I was so happy to get a medal in the end.

'When I think about the big picture, looking back on this, it will be awesome.'

The
 successes maintain the British team's position in third place in the 
medal table.

And another British athlete made history today, becoming the country's first female boxer to compete at the Olympics.

Natasha Jonas, 28, from Liverpool, defeated Quanitta Underwood of the United States 21-13 in the lightweight division.

Last night saw a golden hat-trick for 
Britain in the Olympic Stadium when Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg 
Rutherford each won their events within 45 minutes of one another.

'Super Saturday' had earlier seen three other gold medals awarded to Team GB athletes - two in rowing and yet another in the velodrome.

A
 frenzied crowd in the 80,000-capacity stadium went wild yesterday as 
Ennis, the poster girl of the London Games, won the 800m with a sprint 
finish, crowning two days of tough competition in the heptathlon.

In front of spectators including the 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Olympic silver medalist Zara Phillips and
 Prime Minister David Cameron, Ennis wept as she stood on the podium to 
receive her gold medal.

She said: 'I can't believe I've had 
the opportunity to come to my first Games in London and won an Olympic 
Gold medal. It's unbelievable.'

Former
 sports minister and ex-Sheffield MP Richard Caborn, who was in 
Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium with his family, said: 'She's our golden 
girl. She's stuck with Sheffield and Sheffield's stuck with her.'

Her first coach, Mick Thompson, said: 'You can't get better than this. Where does she go next?'

Rutherford was the next athlete to 
claim victory for Team GB, with a surprise gold medal in the long jump. 
He described his victory as the 'most amazing feeling in the world'.

Rutherford's
 triumph was followed by Farah who danced for joy around the track after
 winning the 10,000m, hailing it as 'the best moment of my life'.

London Games chairman Lord Coe said it was the 'the greatest night of British athletics'.

It topped off a day which also saw 
success away from the stadium - a sensational world record-breaking 
performance by women cyclists in the frenzied atmosphere of the 
velodrome led to another gold in the team pursuit.

The team of Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell led from the start to beat the US in a world record time of 3:14.051.

The trio were presented with their medals before a spontaneous rendition of Hey Jude led by an onlooking Sir Paul McCartney.

And earlier, at Eton Dorney, an 
ecstatic crowd cheered the men's coxless four of Andrew Triggs Hodge, 
Pete Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory to a victory, which extended 
Britain's dominance in the event to 16 years.

This was followed just minutes later by Kat Copeland and Sophie Hosking claiming gold in the lightweight event.

It
 was the best day for gold medals since 1908 with Team GB now boasting 
14 gold, seven silver and eight bronze and in third place after China 
and the US.

Great Britain's men's hockey team produced a brilliant second-half performance to stun the world's best team Australia, coming back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3.

Australia seemed to be coasting towards the semi-finals when two goals from Matt Ford and another from Mark Knowles gave them a commanding lead early in the second half.

But a goal from Team GB's Jonty Clarke began the fightback, and efforts from captain Barry Middleton and James Tindall completed the unlikely recovery.

Britain had only won five of their previous 47 meetings with Australia and had not beaten them since the Olympic semi-final in Seoul in 1988 - the last time that a British hockey team took gold.
