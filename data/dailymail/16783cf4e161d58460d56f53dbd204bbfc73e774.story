Three American students arrested during a protest in Cairo has arrived home after being released from prison yesterday.

Gregory Porter was the first to land at Philadelphia International Airport on Saturday afternoon.

His family from nearby Glenside is 'thrilled that he's home',  relative Sharon Sloan said.

Fellow students Derrik Sweeney, 19 and Luke Gates, 21 landed on American soil later on Saturday. 

They were arrested last Sunday on the roof of a university building near Tahrir Square after being accused of throwing firebombs at Egyptian security forces.

The students, who are spending a semester at the American University in Cairo, were said to have joined with protesters demanding an end to the country's military rule.

Derrik's mother, Joy Sweeney said she met her son,  a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri, at St Louis Airport on Saturday evening.

She added that their release was the 'best Thanksgiving gift' and she was preparing a belated celebratory dinner.

Earlier today, Mr Sweeney's father, Kevin, told CNN that his son had been 
falsely accused and that he was merely 'observing something that was 
definitely a phenomenon of the culture'.

His fellow students Gregory Porter, of Glenside, Pennsylvania,  attends Drexel University while 21-year-old Luke Gates, of Bloomington, Indiana is a student at Indiana University.

Mr Porter’s lawyer said his client 
sounded upbeat in a phone conversation held as the students were being 
escorted by police to the airport.

Egyptian officials confirmed the release of all 
three young men yesterday.

Cairo's
top prosecutor said security forces had found a bag containing empty 
bottles, gasoline, a towel and a camera with the Americans, who 
said the bag belonged to two friends.

The students were studying for a
semester in Cairo to improve their Arabic.

Officials at the students' universities in the U.S. and the American University in Cairo were all working with the State Department and 
Egyptian government to have them released.

Video footage taken from the protests 
shows at least two of the students, their faces covered by bandanas, 
taking part alongside the Egyptians.

Mr Gates, the oldest of the captured students, had been sending tweets from Cairo about attending the massive Egyptian rallies.

'Earlier tonight rubber bullets a charge and then a retreat, my knee and elbow are f****d up,' he wrote during the protests.

The news of the Americans' release came as tens of thousands of protesters thronged in
Tahrir Square today demanding the country's interim Egyptian rulers hand 
over power to a civilian government.

The week of violence has seen at least 41 people killed and 3,000 injured.

The army, once hailed for its role in helping oust former president Hosni Mubarak from power in February, has come under increasing fire for dragging out a handover to civilian rule.

President Obama last night urged Egypt’s military rulers to quit power ‘immediately’ on the biggest day of protest yet in Cairo.

After Friday prayers – the last in Cairo before next week’s crunch election - political marches were organised by some 30 parties, mostly converging on Tahrir Square.

Egypt is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on Monday.
