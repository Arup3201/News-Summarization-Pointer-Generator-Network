It is only days since Prince Harry broke up with his long-term girlfriend Cressida Bonas, but a strip club in Memphis is hoping he will be ready to try to get over the heartbreak by paying them a visit.

The newly single 29-year-old is due to arrive in the Tennessee city where he will attend a society wedding this weekend.

As residents get ready to try to spot the prince during his trip, one of the city’s strip clubs has put up a large sign that says ‘Welcome Prince Harry’.

Jerry Westlund, 46, who owns The Pony club, said: ‘Clearly Prince Harry has come to the U.S. in the past and shown he likes to enjoy himself, and Las Vegas is not the only place to party in the States.

‘We look forward to having him and his friends here in Memphis. We don’t know where he’s going to be when he’s here and whether he will come down. We will certainly be prepared if he chooses to.

‘Everyone in Memphis is excited. We have all been watching the Royal Tour to New Zealand and Australia and this is our chance to have our own Royal visit.’

However, if Prince Harry does choose to visit a strip club while in Memphis, he will discover that they are subject to strict laws that ban nudity, and where girls perform in bikinis.

The fourth-in-line to the throne is flying into Memphis after stopping in Miami Beach on Wednesday night, where he was seen hugging a brunette girl in a nightclub.

He dined with a group of friends at the Hakkasan restaurant before dancing and drinking in a private 'skybox' suspended over the dancefloor.

While the Prince appeared to be enjoying himself, it seemed lessons had been learned from his notorious trip to Vegas, when he was photographed playing a game of strip billiards with an unidentified blonde.

This time security officers tried to stop partygoers taking photos of him on their phones, and asked them to delete the images.

On Saturday, Prince Harry will attend the wedding of London nightclub owner Guy Pelly and Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson at the Memphis Polo Club.

Prince William is also expected to be at the ceremony, where the royal brothers are likely to be ushers.

Friends of Miss Wilson told Mail Online that Prince Harry will stay at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis where rooms cost up to £1,300.

On Thursday night the hotel hosts its weekly rooftop party at its bar, which has been voted the ‘best pick up joint’.

A band called My Crazy Girlfriend is due to perform, although it is not known whether Harry will attend.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas was originally expected to attend the wedding, but the couple split after it is thought they had arguments about the trip.
