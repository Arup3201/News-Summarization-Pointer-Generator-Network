A former school principal who had sex with one of his students is believed to be the father of her child.

John Ward, 55, was arrested and charged with indecent liberties with a student after the 16-year-old girl told police he could be the father of her two-year-old baby.

Ward, who is married, is expected to undergo a paternity test to determine if he is the father.

Under fire: Former principal and transportation director John Ward, is facing charges of inappropriate behavior with a student after a 16-year-old said he may be the father of her baby

The child is now aged two and lives with her mother, a former student at the Montgomery Learning Academy in Troy, North Carolina.

The possibility that Ward is the father came after the girl spoke with police as they investigated the inappropriate relationship.

'I asked the victim, “could the child possibly be Mr Wards’?” She said, “yes,”’ said Montgomery County detective Lt. Kelley Howell.

Police were tipped off about the baby by school officials.

Ward has been employed with Montgomery County Schools since 2002.

He has worked as a band director, assistant principal and principal. His last role was as transportation director for the school district.

Local TV station WFMY said the school district received a complaint about Ward and the student back in 2011.

But after investigating the complaint no action was taken and the police were not called in.

But on Monday after receiving another complaint about Ward they notified the sheriff's department.

Sheriff's questioned Ward and he allegedly confessed to the relationship.

Ward's wife, who works for the Department of Social Services in Montgomery County, has been suspended with pay from her job while the investigation into her husband continues.

She is said to have only found out about the affair this week.

According to Lt. Detective Kelly Howell most of the sexual encounters took place at Ward’s home, where the student frequently stayed for several days at the time.

None of the encounters occurred at the school said Howell.

During the time of the affair and while a student at the Learning Academy, the student had a baby.

‘They both stated that they had a sexual relationship with each other,’ said Lt. Kelley Howell with the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department. 

‘There was a child. The child’s father’s in question. It may be Mr Ward’s, it may not be.'

School chiefs issued a statement reassuring parents.

'Although this situation is very disturbing and upsetting – it does not define who we are.  It is sad that it might somehow overshadow the tremendous work that our employees do on a daily basis — being leaders and role models for our students.

'It is already a part of our annual process to remind employees about inappropriate relationships with students.  However, we will continue to evaluate existing and additional training opportunities to ensure that employees understand the importance of keeping the student-educator relationship professional. '

Ward has since posted bond.
