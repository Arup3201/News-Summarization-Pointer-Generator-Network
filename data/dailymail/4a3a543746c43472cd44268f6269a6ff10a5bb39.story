It may only be the end of January, but Saturday's Chelsea versus Manchester City clash is set to have a massive impact on the outcome of the Premier League title race.

Jose Mourinho's team have the opportunity to move eight points clear of the defending champions if they claim all three points at Stamford Bridge, a position they surely wouldn't surrender.

Manuel Pellegrini's side must avoid defeat to preserve their chances of retaining their title and are boosted by the absence of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas from the Chelsea line-up.

City, meanwhile, will be without talisman Yaya Toure and new striker Wilfried Bony after the Ivory Coast advanced to the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.

A win will see Chelsea extend their advantage to a surely-insurmountable eight points and all the omens are in their favour.

Sport analysts Bloomberg Sports believe that a Chelsea win at Stamford Bridge is the most likely outcome against title rivals Manchester City

No team has beaten City more often in the Premier League era than Chelsea, with 22 wins to their name.

Chelsea have won 11 and lost just one of the last 16 Premier League meetings against City and Mourinho has won seven and lost just two of his 11 meetings against Manuel Pellegrini.
