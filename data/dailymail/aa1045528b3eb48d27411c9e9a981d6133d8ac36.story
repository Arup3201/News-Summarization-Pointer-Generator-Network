Russian police seized the remains of the endangered animals and also confiscated 110lbs of meat they believe came from a rare Amur tiger and  leopard.

The restaurant, on the outskirts of the Russian capital Moscow, prided itself on serving 'exotic and expensive' dishes.

Some of the country's elite believe tiger meat will improve performance everywhere from the 'boardroom to the bedroom'.

A police spokesman said: 'We are working on the assumption that the animals were hunted and killed to facilitate the restaurant offering exotic and lucrative dishes.

'It is also possible that the remains not used in cooking could be sold on for high sums to the traditional Asian medicine market.

'One kilogramme of tiger meat can fetch around £1,000.

'Heads are estimated to be valued at £2,500 while the tiger skin is estimated to be worth around £7,000.

'Tiger meat is quite popular amongst certain members of the elite because they believe that eating it improves performance from the boardroom to the bedroom.'
