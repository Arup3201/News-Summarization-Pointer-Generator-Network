A couple has filed a lawsuit against their dog-sitter, claiming she kidnapped their prize Samoyed, had him neutered without their permission, and won't give him back.

Cecile and Victor Stanton of Jericho, New York are suing Beverly Jeffries for $350,000, claiming that she won't give the dog back after they signed over temporary guardianship of the dog, officially named Polar Mist You Gotta Believe, to Jeffries in February.

The suit, which is claiming damages for 'breach of contract, promissory fraud, and intentional infliction of severe emotional distress', contends that Jeffries also had the champion stud neutered without their permission.

The precious pooch, which answers to Justin, was allegedly worth $250,000, but now that he's been desexed, he's lost at least $100,000 in value, says the couple.

According to papers filed in a Pasadena, California court, the Stantons signed over temporary guardianship of the dog to Jeffries in February, but retained ownership.

When the couple asked for the dog back in May, Jeffries refused, and the couple discovered the animal had been neutered in April without their permission.

The Stantons bought the dog in 2006, and he's an American Kennel Club registered Grand Champion.

According to the Courthouse News,
the complaint reads: 'The plaintiffs, especially Cecile Stanton, have 
developed a strong personal relationship with Justin and always expected
him to be returned promptly upon request.'

'Because of the behavior of the defendant by neutering Justin and not returning him, the plaintiffs have been severely distressed, losing sleep, being frequently upset during the daytime, and generally worried that the irrational behavior of the defendants will cause further harm to Justin and cause further separation between Justin and the plaintiffs who dearly want him returned.'

Cecile Stanton, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as a breeder and 
owner of Snow Tracks Kennels lists 'stud services' for Polar Mist You 
Gotta Believe on various breeder sites.

A show record for Justin on infodog.com indicates that he placed first or won 'Best of Breed' in 10 shows between 2007 and 2010.

According to Courthouse News, the Stantons are both older than 65 and are living in Arizona; Jeffries lives in Pasadena.

According to the AKC, Samoyeds are an ancient breed from Siberia that were used for herding, hunting and pulling sleds.

Nowadays, they're highly sought-after pets and show dogs.
