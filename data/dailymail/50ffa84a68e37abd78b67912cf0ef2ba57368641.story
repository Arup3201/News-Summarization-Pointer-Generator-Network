Two employees at a North Dakota barbecue restaurant have been fired after a Facebook post suggesting Native Americans are bad tippers went viral.

The post included a photograph of Andrea Casson, a worker at Famous Dave's in Bismarck, holding a cardboard sign that says: 'Spare change? Help, I'm a server at Famous Dave's on Pow Wow weekend. Anything helps! 5c, 25c! It's more than my tips.'

The United Tribes International Pow Wow, held last weekend in Bismark, is an annual festival that attracts tens of thousands of Native Americans to the area.

Fired: This photograph of Andrea Casson, a worker at Famous Dave's in Bismarck, North Dakota, got her and a colleague fired

Casson was pictured in the restaurant wearing her uniform. She and the employee who took the photo were both fired. The other employee hasn't been named.

'Like many employers, we employ many people. People have opinions. Social media allows an outlet for these opinions,' owner Mike Wright said in a statement on Facebook.

'Sadly, for reasons unknown to me, often times bitter employees also try to embarrass the employers and taint the businesses where they work. Clearly a recent post by a now former employee fits this description.'

He added that the post was 'obviously offensive and ridiculous.'

Festival: The picture, taken at the Bismarck restaurant, pictured, was posted before the annual Pow Wow festival, which brings hundreds of Native Americans to the area

Viral: The racially charged post went viral and made its way to the restaurant's Facebook page

Wright told the Bismarck Tribune that Casson had privately apologized to him for her 'mistake.'

He said he found out about the post when customers began calling the restaurant to complain, and the photo was reposted on the restaurant's Facebook page. Some people even cancelled catering orders.

Casson denied creating the cardboard sign she holds in the picture, but she doesn't deny posing for the picture.

'One of my friends that worked there as well came to visit, and she asked me to hold this poster up, so she could send a Snapchat,' Casson told KMOT 10.

Mistake: Casson, pictured, apologized for her poor judgement on local TV

But it was posted on Facebook as well as Snapchat - a photo sharing app where pictures are meant to disappear after they've been received.

She added to KMOT: 'People are just assuming it was me who made the sign. Not that it really matters because, I mean, she asked me to hold it up and I did. I could have said no. But I take full responsibility. It was something I chose to do.'

Since the picture was posted, Casson has received several threats, according to the TV station, and the Bismarck Police Department has even called to do a welfare check.
