Yohan Cabaye ensured Zlatan Ibrahimovic was able to get one over on his old boss Roberto Mancini in the Qatar Winter Tour match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan.

The French midfielder calmly slotted home in the 57th minute to give PSG a deserved 1-0 victory at Le Grand Stade in Marrakech, Morocco, on Tuesday night.

Ibrahimovic and Mancini had warmly embraced before the game - smiling and laughing as they shook hands - but the Swedish striker seemed determined to secure a win over his former manager.

Host commentator

That concludes tonight's friendlies. Thank you for following all the action live on Sportsmail. Goodbye.

The referee brings a close to the friendly. In truth it was a rather lackluster affair and both sides will be pleased that they come away from the match without any injuries.

We're into injury time...

88 mins: Just two minutes remain and it seems PSG will hold to a narrow win. Ibrahima Mbaye comes close to levelling the scores but his header is well saved by Douchez.

82 mins: It may take a long-range shot to get Inter back into this and they nearly do so through Andrea Palazzi's swerving effort. Unfortunately for the youngster his shot flies just wide of the post.

80 mins: There are just 10 minutes remaining. Inter are starting to push for an equaliser but the French side are still looking relatively comfortable in defence.

72 mins: Less than 20 minutes are remaining in this friendly and Inter look short of ideas at present as PSG dominate. Can Mancini do anything to change the outcome of the match?

67 mins: On chances created it should be 4-1 to PSG after they squander another opportunity. Van der Wiel again marauds down the right-flank and picks out Rabiot but he he can only blaze a shot high and wide from eight-yards out.

63 mins: Cabaye's goal has given PSG real confidence. they're knocking the ball about with confidence now. Explosive winger Lucas Moura is now on the pitch too - just to make things harder for Inter.

57 mins: AT LAST THE DEADLOCK IS BROKEN! It wasn't a moment of magic, as predcited, but a well-worked goal nonetheless. Van der Wiel drives in a low cross down the right-hand flank which just evades the onrushing Matuidi. Following up though is Yohan Cabaye who sidefoots the cross with precision into the bottom corner. Will this spark a goalfest?

53 mins: Despite the early second half chance the match has fallen back into the same pattern as the first. At the moment it looks like a moment of genius will be needed to separate the two team teams.

46 mins: Once again they nearly do. Lucas Digne whips in a delightful early ball into the path of Ibrahimovic who's first time side-foot is denied brilliantly by Handanovic. The forward will be pleased to see the commanding goalkeeper replaced just moments later as both sides make changes.

Both teams have emerged for the second half and PSG get the second half started. Will the fans in Morocco see a goal?

The referee brings an end to first half proceedings here in Morocco. In truth it's been a rather dull affair with both sides creating little chances. Will there be a breakthrough in the second half?

45 mins: Serge Aurier goes down after winning a sliding challenge. Lucky for Laurent Blanc, his defender get back up to his feet after receiving some treatment from the medical team. Injuries in a meaningless game would infuriate the PSG boss.

43 mins: We mentioned Kovavic earlier in the build-up and the Croat midfielkder shows his class with a beautiful through ball into the path of Mauro Icardi. With only Nicolas Douchez to beat, the 21-year-old dinks his shot into the side netting.

37 mins: The French giants should be 2-0 ahead but instead it's goalless. After Ibrahimovic's miss earlier, Adrien Rabiot tries his luck from 20-yards out with a dipping left-footed volley. Handanovic can only parry the ball into the path of Blaise Matuidi who shoots straight at the Inter 'keeper with the goal at his mercy.

33 mins: Over half an hour has been played and sadly this friendly hasn't followed the same way as Real Madrid vs AC Milan earlier. Both teams have created little going forward, with Ibrahimovic's effort the closest so far.

26 mins: At last we get our first significant chance and it falls to the most dangerous man on the pitch. Gregory van der Wiel does brilliantly to cut back a cross to Ibrahimovic. From seven-yards out though the Sweden international can only scuff a shot that is kicked away by Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic.

19 mins: The opening 19 minutes of the match have seen both teams enjoy brief spells of early pressure. The momentum is once more with Inter. Midfielder Hernanes does brilliantly to weave his way into the PSG box but sees his cross-cum-shot blocked by Aurier for a corner. Sadly for the Italians nothing comes from the resulting set piece.

12 mins: PSG are starting to exert some pressure of their own into the match. Ibrahimovic is becoming increasingly more involved in the game and every time he touches the ball, the crowd go wild. 

7 mins: Mancini will be pleased with his side's start to the match. They're pressing well - denying their opponents time and space on the ball.

5 mins: The opening stages have seen Inter start the brighter of the two teams. Just moments ago Zdravko Kuzmanovic came close to opening the scoring but saw his 25-yard pile driver just whistle past the post.

Inter get proceedings underway...

The stadium in Marrakech is far from full but both teams are out on to the pitch. Can we expect a similar scoreline to AC Milan 4-2 Real Madrid earlier?

What more can you say about Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The maverick forward is a star attraction wherever he goes and he will want to put on a show against his former club.

Mancini's counterpart Laurent Blanc has taken a different approach to tonight's friendly and has elected to field an experimental XI with right back Serge Aurier starting in the heart of central defence.PSG XI: Douchez; Van Der Wiel, Aurier, Camara, Digne; Verratti, Chantome, Matuidi, Cabaye, Rabiot; Ibrahimovic 

Inter boss Roberto Mancini has named a strong line-up for today friendly by virtually naming his strongest possible 11. Talented Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic starts for the Italian giants. Inter XI: Handanovic; D'Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Andreolli, Juan Jesus; M'Vila, Kuzmanovic; Bonazzoli, Kovacic, Hernanes; Icardi
