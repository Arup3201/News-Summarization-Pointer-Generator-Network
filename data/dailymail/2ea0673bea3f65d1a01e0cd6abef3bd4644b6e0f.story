Earl Spencer and Lord Rothschild are leading a growing revolt by landowners against the Government’s High Speed Two rail line.

A string of aristocratic families are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying Parliament to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form.

They have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will blight property prices, carve up Britain’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls.

The new objectors, including Prince William’s close friends Nicholas and Alice van Cutsem and the Duke of Wellington’s  descendant Lord Richard Wellesley, have made their views public in official petitions to Parliament asking for amendments to the Bill paving the way for the proposed £50 billion link from London to Birmingham.

The scheme, which the Government argues will boost Britain’s economy, will cut the  1 hour 21 minute journey time from London to Birmingham  by 32 minutes.

The objectors complain that the link will ‘sever’ their estates, cause ‘intolerable noise’ and adversely affect wildlife  and areas of outstanding natural beauty.

And they are calling for a long list of changes including tunnelling, fences to protect wildlife, higher compensation payments and anti-noise barriers.

Princess Diana’s brother Earl Spencer has submitted his petition because the line is earmarked to go through the Wormleighton Estate in Warwickshire. The Spencer family lived in the manor until 1645, but abandoned it for the Althorp estate in Northamptonshire during the English Civil War.

In the petition the Earl and the other trustees of the estate complain their land will be ‘severed’ by the proposed HS2 rail line.

The document says Government plans to acquire parts of the land through compulsory purchase, needed to dump excavated earth, are of particular concern and brands the compensation scheme ‘inadequate’.

The HS2 link is being opposed by a section of aristocrats who complain the rail link will cause them nuisance and disruption

Another issue raised is that the HS2 construction will exacerbate ‘the problems associated with rabbits and deer’, with Earl Spencer calling for fencing to be installed to protect the estate, which encompasses the 16th century Wormleighton Manor.

A second petition by Lord Rothschild raises concerns that part of the Waddesdon Estate in Buckinghamshire, given by his family to the National Trust, will be hacked off when the HS2 route is driven through it.

He speaks of the ‘intolerable’ noise and dust expected from the works, as well as warning of the possible reduction in visitors to the estate.

Nicholas van Cutsem, a childhood friend of Prince William, and his wife Alice are equally upset about the havoc the HS2 line looks set to wreak in their bucolic corner of England. The pair live in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire – a few hundred feet from the route.

Army Major van Cutsem warned in his petition: ‘Public right of ways will be stripped of their rural nature and tranquillity by HS2. Your petitioner and family will also suffer years of disruption and difficulty from the construction.’

Van Cutsem backed suggestions it would be better for the high-speed trains to go through a ‘bored tunnel’.

Meanwhile Lord Richard Wellesley, who owns a farm on the Marston St Lawrence Estate in Brackley, Northamptonshire, which will be bisected by the HS2 route, also made his discontent clear.

The upper-class rebellion brewing in the Tory heartlands is likely to come as fresh embarrassment to the Government, which has experienced opposition to HS2 from the ranks of Tory MPs.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has also entered a petition. It demands  the Government backtrack on powers allowing them during the construction work to disturb war memorials and First World War graves, without informing the Commission.

Ralph Smythe, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said last night: ‘The proposals before Parliament for HS2 will, unless radically changed, destroy the setting of some of the country’s most historic houses.’
