Alex Salmond yesterday issued a chilling demand for state control of the BBC in Scotland to further the nationalist cause.

The former SNP leader, who is standing for Parliament in the election, was accused of a naked attempt to interfere with the Corporation’s independence after saying it had a ‘metropolitan bias’ that works against his party’s cause.

In a clear threat, he said broadcasting should be placed ‘under the remit of our democratically-elected parliament in Scotland’.

Protest: Nationalists wave a 'Sack Nick Robinson' banner in Glasgow in September last year

Mr Salmond, addressing the party’s Spring conference in Glasgow, also said the SNP would form a left-wing alliance with Labour at Westminster to raise the top rate of income tax to 50p.

But it was his intemperate attack on the national broadcaster that raised eyebrows. 

During last year’s independence referendum campaign, hundreds of nationalist ‘Yes’ supporters held a protest outside BBC Scotland in Glasgow with a banner referring to the Corporation’s political editor that said: ‘Sack Nick “The Liar” Robinson.’

Mr Salmond said: ‘What surprised me was the degree to which the BBC allowed themselves to be influenced by headlines in a biased press. I had no surprise about the written press but I was surprised and disappointed by the way [the BBC] allowed themselves to be… by that agenda.’

He added: ‘I don’t think the broadcasting issue...will be properly resolved until we have broadcasting under the remit of our democratically-elected parliament in Scotland.’ 

A labour peer has hit back at David Cameron for calling the party’s leadership ‘sneering, hopeless’ Hampstead Lefties.

Veteran broadcaster Joan Bakewell yesterday rounded on the Prime Minister for criticising ‘champagne socialists’ from the fashionable London borough where she lives.

Mr Cameron used the Tory spring conference on Saturday to accuse Mr Miliband and his supporters of displaying the ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’.

Baroness Bakewell told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘He’s had a go at me and many like me: “Spare us from Ed’s sneering, hopeless Hampstead lefties.” Why? Why should we be excluded like this? We’ve got votes, we’ve got interests, we’ve got consciences, we care about the poor and the dispossessed, we are willing to pay our taxes.

‘Clearly Cameron is panicking. It’s just abusive, personal attacks. It’s not about policies – he just doesn’t like us.’ 

Mr Salmond also boasted about how closely he could work with Ed Miliband as the SNP unveiled its support for tax hikes.Scotland’s former first minister said that the party had experience in ‘upsetting the apple cart’, which it would deploy at Westminster.

The SNP will back Ed Balls’s controversial scheme to balance the country’s books by increasing the income tax rate from 45p to 50p for those earning over £150,000.

Mr Miliband has claimed that he would not go into a formal coalition with the SNP, but the nationalists yesterday backed a string of Labour policies in the latest sign of how the parties could work together to push through a left-wing agenda

SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: ‘In the next Parliament, SNP MPs will support the re-introduction of the 50p tax rate for the very wealthiest.’ He said he hoped the party would have a ‘huge group’ of MPs after May 7 that would also vote with Labour to abolish the so-called bedroom tax.

Mr Salmond yesterday said the Tories’ attempts to portray Mr Miliband as in his pocket were ‘fundamentally stupid’. He added: ‘In terms of skulduggery and upsetting the apple cart and various parliamentary techniques, there’s a wee bit of experience might be there in the group we have.’

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon yesterday confirmed the party would demand an MP on each Commons committee, including for devolved issues such as health and education, if it does well in the election.

Labour introduced the higher rate tax band, paid by those earning more than £150,000, in 2010. The Coalition then cut it to 45p in 2012, prompting Labour to accuse them of giving a ‘tax cut to millionaires’.

But official figures show Britain’s richest have paid more income tax since it was abolished. Tory MP Iain Stewart said yesterday: ‘This is another example of Labour-SNP collusion. Nicola Sturgeon has made it absolutely clear she would prop up a minority Labour government.’

Labour shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said: ‘This is a naked attempt by Alex Salmond to interfere in an institution that no political party would attempt to control. The BBC is independent of Government and it should stay that way.’ A BBC Scotland spokesman said: ‘Our coverage of the referendum was fair and balanced.’
