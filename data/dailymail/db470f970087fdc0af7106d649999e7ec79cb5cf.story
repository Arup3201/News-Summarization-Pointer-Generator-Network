Who needs a centre-forward when you have David Silva? The little Spaniard rescued strikerless Manchester City on Saturday as Manuel Pellegrini’s men glossed over their injury problems to make it eight wins in a row and join Chelsea at the top of the Premier League.

James Milner was given the false No 9 role because of injuries to Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, but it was Silva who provided support and, ultimately, the knockout punch with two quickfire goals in the second half.

The 28-year-old is referred to as ‘Merlin’ by team-mates because of his wizardry on the ball and the only surprise was that he waited for more than a year to score at the Etihad.

Yaya Toure added a cracking third goal in the 81st minute and City are now level on 39 points with Chelsea and only one behind on goal difference, while Jose Mourinho’s side face a difficult trip to Stoke tomorrow.

Pellegrini was happy with his experiment of using Milner up front. It was the player’s seventh different outfield position in his City career. ‘I was always confident because I thought we played well in the first half. We showed patience to create space so I was absolutely sure we would score in the end,’ he said. ‘Milner did well, it was a sacrificed performance. He is a player who works really hard and created a lot of movement.

“I am happy the squad as a whole demonstrated why we won the league. We had no Aguero, no [Vincent] Kompany, no Jovetic, and others showed what they can do.’

It was Silva, though, who made the difference and justified Neil Warnock’s assertion that he was “head and shoulders” above any other player on the pitch.

Despite territorial domination, City did not register a shot on target in the first half, with Pablo Zabaleta clipping the best chance wide after 43 minutes. But just as City feared they would not achieve a breakthrough, they were given some help early in the second half.

Fernandinho started the move with a clever pass to overlapping Zabaleta. The Argentine cut the ball back instead of shooting and although Silva did not make great contact, his shot went between Scott Dann’s legs, deflected off the inside of his thigh and past Julian Speroni.

‘I can’t blame the wingers for not tracking back, a defender let us down,’ said Palace boss Warnock.

The relief was evident and it was no surprise that after 61 minutes Pellegrini and his assistant, Brian Kidd, were punching the air with joy once again. It was another good build-up. Samir Nasri and Toure were involved, and this time the overlapping full-back was on the left — Aleksandar Kolarov. He swept in a cross and this time Silva connected first-time with his left foot to beat Speroni from eight yards. It was a classy finish from a classy player and showed how much City missed him when he was sidelined with a knee injury.

Palace had a fleeting chance at 2-0 down when James McArthur headed in Yannick Bolasie’s cross and was wrongly flagged offside because Fernandinho was playing him on.

‘It was miles onside and a goal then would have put the whole stadium in doubt,’ complained Warnock. But given that McArthur was lucky to escape unpunished for a dive in the first half, you could perhaps call it ‘karma’. Silva was substituted soon afterwards to a standing ovation, replaced by Frank Lampard. Palace sent on Wilfried Zaha, on loan from Manchester United, and therefore the recipient of some pantomime boos from City fans.

The third goal came in the 81st minute. Jesus Navas used his pace to break from midfield, his pass to Milner was then shifted on to Toure, and he powered through to blast a left-footed finish past Speroni.

Milner departed soon afterwards leaving Toure to assume the role of centre-forward and there was even a late rare cameo for forgotten man Scott Sinclair — just in time for other clubs to have a peek ahead of the January transfer window.

At the back, injured skipper Kompany was hardly missed and keeper Joe Hart was rarely troubled 24 hours after signing a new four-and-a-half year contract.

Chelsea realise they have a huge job on their hands if they are to take the Premier League trophy from City who have settled after an autumn wobble.

‘You don’t win the title in December but you play so many games, you must be as close as you can if you want to be involved at the end,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe nobody believed one or two months ago that we’d still be in the Champions League or fighting for the title, but we always trust in what we can do.’

Pellegrini does not expect to have any of his ‘real’ forwards to be fit for the Boxing Day trip to West Brom but Jovetic, nursing a hamstring strain, has the best chance of facing Burnley on December 28.

On Saturday, City did not need a striker. Not when they had Silva.
