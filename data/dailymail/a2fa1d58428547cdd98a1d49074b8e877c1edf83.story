Comic book artist Jerry Robinson, who helped create Batman's sidekick, Boy Wonder Robin and their arch enemy The Joker, has died at 89.

Robinson, who passed away in his sleep at his New York home, was only 17 when he was hired by Batman creator Bob Kane.

The two met by chance at a resort in 
the Catskill Mountains, where Robinson had a summer job selling ice 
cream. Kane noticed Robinson because he was wearing a white jacket 
decorated with his own illustrations.

In the early 1940s, Robinson 
'illustrated some of the defining images of pop culture's greatest 
icons,' said Jim Lee, co-publisher of DC Entertainment Inc, the parent 
company of Batman publisher DC Comics.

He drew many of the most striking covers 
from the golden age of comics, such as that of 'Batman' No. 13, showing 
the caped crusader gliding to the ground by parachute.

While Robinson is credited by many 
comic enthusiasts as the primary creator of The Joker for issue No. 1 of
 Batman, he and Kane clashed over who was first to dream up the caped 
crusader's nemesis.

In a 1994 interview, Kane said he and
 writer Bill Finger had come up with the idea and Robinson then produced
 a joker playing card for inspiration

Robinson, a native of Trenton, New Jersey, used his fame and position in the industry to serve as its ambassador, and he fought for other artists and creators to win credit for their work especially in the Superman series.

In the 1930s and '40s, publishers owned the rights and would discard drawings after they were used.

In the 1950s, he started drawing newspaper comic strips, political cartoons and cover illustrations for Broadway's 'Playbill.'

Later Robinson taught at New York's School of Visual Arts and was president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists and the National Cartoonists Society.

An editor and friend, Charles Kochman,
 said Robinson was different from most artists in the field because he 
worked on every kind of comic genre.

'Jerry brought a realism to comics and
 a sense of humor,' said Kochman, his editor at Abrams Comic Arts, which
 last year published a book called Jerry Robinson: Ambassador of Comics.

'He saw the value of comics as an art,' Kochman said.

In recent years, rare issues of comic books have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction.

Robinson also served as a historian, writing The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art and curating gallery exhibits, including one of the biggest at the Kennedy Library in Washington in 1973 that included all the genres of the strip comic art form.

Mike Marts, editor of the Batman line at DC Comics, said Robinson was 'an innovator, a pioneer in storytelling.'

He added: 'The streets of Gotham City are a little lonelier today.'
