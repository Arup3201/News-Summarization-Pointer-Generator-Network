Sheffield United have signed Rio Ferdinand, David Luiz and Branislav Ivanovic in time to face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup... that's if you believe the Irish Independent.

The newspaper have somehow managed to muddle up both Sheffield United and Tottenham's predicted XIs for Wednesday night's match at White Hart Lane. 

Mauricio Pochettino appears to have acquired a handful of West Brom players - including Gareth McAuley and Jonas Olsson - who have been deployed in both defence and midfield.

Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has been handed the chance to lead Tottenham's line alongside Baggies midfielder Claudio Yacob.

Begovic is in fact down to play for both sides as he has been placed in between the Sheffield United sticks. 

League One side Sheffield United, on the other hand, have a French forward attacking duo of Arsenal's Olivier Giroud and Cardiff loanee Kevin Theophile-Catherine.

Tottenham's actual side for their Capital One Cup semi-final is likely to include Emmanuel Adebayor, who is in the running to make his first start since November 2. 

The Irish Independent may be disappointed when they notice the likes of Ferdinand, Luiz and Giroud are not on the White Hart Lane turf.
