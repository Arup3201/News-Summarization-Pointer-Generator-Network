Two sheriff's deputies have resigned after a female officer was caught having sex on the job and, in a separate incident, a male officer was charged with domestic violence, authorities said on Friday.

Deputy Loretta Hernandez, 39, admitted that she was delayed in responding to calls because she was engaged in sexual activity while on duty in Rockdale County, Georgia. Two incidents took place inside her patrol car and once inside a business after hours.

Deputy Chad Stuarte, 26, was arrested on May 3 after a domestic violence incident involving his wife at his Covington home.

Deputy Hernandez resigned instead of being terminated at a disciplinary hearing for misconduct, Cpl. Michael Camp said. She had been placed on administrative leave on April 25.

Cpl Camp told ajc.com: 'In at least two of the incidents, she was in her full uniform and in her marked RCSO patrol unit in public.

In the third incident, Deputy Hernandez, while on duty, was outside of her patrol car inside a local business that was closed.'

Stuarte was arrested at his home earlier this month. He was charged with battery and booked into the Newtown County Jail. He resigned after being placed on administrative leave.

The investigation revealed that Stuarte had fired his police service weapon into the floor of his home during an argument with his wife and then attempted to cover up what he had done.
