Paul Scholes has revealed that a coaching role in football has never been something that he former Manchester United midfielder has been 'passionate about'.

Despite being part of United's backroom staff towards the end of last season, Scholes claims working behind the scenes wasn't something that got him going.

Speaking to Sam Wallace of the i and Independent, Scholes said: 'I am not really bothered about pressure or it being a tough job.

'In the coaching stints I have had I don't know if coaching is something that has really got me going.

'It's not something that gets me out of bed in the morning thinking "I really want to do this". But in the next couple of years, who knows?'

The 39-year-old, who featured in the Class of '92's 5-1 defeat at the hands of Salford City on Thursday night, was drafted in after the sacking of David Moyes last season as his former team-mate Ryan Giggs took the helm for the final four games of the Premier League season.

Player-manager Giggs inspired his team to a 4-0 Premier League win against Norwich in his first game in charge before slumping to a 1-0 defeat against Sunderland the following week.

The Welshman picked up seven points from a possible 12 during his brief spell in charge and Scholes believes a slightly better record could have seen the now assistant manager being offered the full-time job instead of Louis van Gaal.

Scholes added: 'We would like to have won four games and maybe Ryan would have had a better chance to get the job full-time.

'It was great working with him and being with Nicky (Butt) and Phil (Neville).

'Ryan was great as well and I am sure he is being groomed to be the manager in the next few years.'
