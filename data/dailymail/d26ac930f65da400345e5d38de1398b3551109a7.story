For England, and Roy Hodgson, the World Cup now gets very real. On Thursday, for the first time since qualification was confirmed on October 15, 2013, it can be taken away from them.

There is a permutation of results in Group D that would see England removed from meaningful competition by 3pm, local time, on Friday.

Another sequence would make progress a possibility in mathematical terms alone. Lose to Uruguay and, if Italy and Costa Rica draw, England are out. Lose to Uruguay and, if there is a winner in the other game, England would need to be the first team in the history of the World Cup to go through having been defeated in their opening two games. Even then, it would require a favour from Italy in the last round of group matches.

Under pressure: Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson is in desperate need of a win after defeat to Italy in Manaus

Knockout football, Hodgson called it, 
and he is right. From here, any team that lost its opening game cannot 
afford a second reversal. Even a draw would leave England perilously 
close to a humiliatingly early return — with Costa Rica able to play for
 a single point in the final match in Belo Horizonte.

For
 all the praise afforded Hodgson and his players after a  spirited 
performance in Manaus, the reality is that no margin for error remains.

England
 are vulnerable: to rotten luck, to random events and in particular to 
the kind of dark arts Gus Poyet, the Sunderland manager, spoke of when 
he explained the clash of cultures that will unfold in Sao Paulo.

‘I
 know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,’ he said. 
‘But not for us. It’s part of the game.’ Poyet’s admission suggests 
that, in Uruguay, the ‘by any means necessary’ speech that Daniel  
Sturridge gave on Monday would have more sinister meaning.

Sturridge
 insisted he didn’t mean he would cheat to win. Anyone who has seen 
Suarez’s tumble against Argentina in the victory that helped secure 
Uruguay’s play-off place would not be similarly assuaged.

Key moments: England manager Hodgson knows his side must deliver against Uruguay

Without
 doubt, Suarez is a changed man in English football. Like Didier Drogba,
 Cristiano Ronaldo and many imports to the Premier League, he has 
discovered that diving is considered one of football’s foulest acts in 
his adopted home.

If 
anything, last season, the times he should have had a penalty and was 
unjustly spurned by the referee must have neared double figures.

At
 a World Cup, in Uruguay’s colours, it is different. A large number of 
players here see any form of  contact as justification to fall. There is
 no controversy, no inquest, no consequence for them. Thomas Muller’s 
theatrics saw Pepe sent off in Germany’s win over Portugal but passed 
with barely a comment in Brazil. Sao Paulo’s stadium may be the home of a
 club called Corinthians, but there that spirit ends.

And
 this is do or die, when  Suarez’s almost deranged desire to win takes 
over. The downside for Uruguay is no different to that for England — the
 threat is greater, in fact, as they have Italy to play last.

Suarez
 has been rushed back from injury in what amounts to a rare gamble from 
coach Oscar  Tabarez. England’s hope, therefore, is that another bold 
forward display succeeds in putting distance between the teams, so one 
fateful moment cannot influence the outcome. Undoubtedly, Uruguay’s 
defence is weak. It needs to be hit, and hard, to counter the Suarez 
effect.

Determined: Daniel Sturridge admitted he will do everything he possibly can to help England emerge victorious in Sao Paulo

Honest: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet (right) believes Uruguay will go to any length necessary to get a result against Hodgson's side

‘We believe Suarez 
will be back and that will be a big confidence boost for their whole 
team,’ said Hodgson. ‘I think we’d be very foolish if we started basing 
our ideas about them on one game against Costa Rica. I think we have got
 to see beyond that and be ready for a very difficult encounter.

‘There
 is no doubt Uruguay are different when Suarez is in the team. Football 
is about the players. A team can be organised or not but the bottom line
 is always “what players have you got and how many are exceptional?” An 
exceptional player can lift a team. We saw Diego Maradona do it with 
Napoli.’

Hodgson added: 
‘They had never won anything really in Italy and then suddenly Maradona 
pitched up and they become champions and won the Uefa Cup. It doesn’t 
really matter whether you have played against someone or know his game, 
great players are great players. When you talk about Argentina now it 
always comes back to Lionel Messi. In every team there is one name that 
is a bit exceptional.

‘It is
 not as if we’re going into the unknown, though. We know how good Suarez
 is. Our players will have to make certain that they deal with him as 
they do when they play against Liverpool.

‘He’s
 a front player. He plays all along that line. He makes runs behind 
defenders, he comes off and gets the ball short. He does all the things 
you want a top player to do. All we can do is ensure our defence is 
compact and we don’t give him the space to play as he wants.’

Point to prove: Suarez is hoping to knock England out of the World Cup and get Uruguay's campaign back on track

If
 this is seen as Hodgson reverting to cautious type, he should be 
indulged. Against all expectation he went to Manaus with a very open 
mind  and an even more open game plan, and while England are likely to 
field the same attacking team, with perhaps the odd tweak in the 
positioning, he will win no plaudits this time for an entertaining or 
encouraging defeat. Uruguay were the last of South America’s qualifiers —
 needing to win a play-off against Jordan — and looked distinctly 
unimpressive without Suarez against Costa Rica.

Repeat
 the level of performance against Italy and England are expected to win.
 Fail, and the inquest will delve deeper than the general acceptance 
that it just wasn’t England’s day again.

Hodgson
 seemed to leave a degree of uncertainty around Rooney when, asked if he
 might alter his position from wide on the left, he started talking 
about refusing to say whether he was in or out. Nobody had suggested he 
might be out. He isn’t, and shouldn’t be, but it indicates his future as
 a certain starter for England is now up for discussion, behind closed 
doors as well as in the public arena.

By
 returning Rooney to the  middle, as seems likely, Hodgson is hoping to 
make a virtue of having England’s leading goalscorer nearer to goal, 
where he can inflict most damage. He insisted Rooney’s  performance in 
Manaus was not dissected at any great length,  suggesting he was happy 
with what he saw. It would be a ferociously brave decision to ditch 
Rooney for a match of this significance — and harsh, considering the 
selfless way he played against Italy. He needs to be given a chance to 
influence this World Cup as a match-winner, to come to the party as 
others with his scoring record have done.

Centre of attention: Uruguay fell to a surprise 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica without Suarez (centre) on Saturday

The
 temperature in Sao Paulo will certainly be friendlier to England than 
the Amazonian heat of Manaus and, bar Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, everyone 
is fit. Time to deliver is the hoariest old cliche for England at World 
Cup tournaments, but it is coming round to that moment just the same.

‘We
 didn’t go all-out attack against Italy and we won’t be saying that 
against Uruguay, either, but we do have the sort of players that are 
capable of hurting them,’ said Hodgson. ‘I thought we played at a very 
good pace the other night and I don’t know whether we’re capable of 
playing much faster than that. We saw that even a top team like Italy 
was tested by the quality of our attacking play and we’re not going to 
dispense with any of those weapons.’

Yet, this time, going down fighting won’t be so well received.

O
 jogo bonito is worthless without its cutting edge. There are a lot of 
good, attacking teams at this tournament and England need to join them 
in the second round. This is a match England should win; they can get no
 further here on looks alone.
