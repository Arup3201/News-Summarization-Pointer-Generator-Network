Federal authorities have raided several underground brothels and charged 13 people in a sex slave ring that forced
young Mexican women into prostitution in New York and New Jersey.

The authorities say some of the women were delivered to farms in New Jersey,
where each would have sex with up to two dozen farm workers a day. Others
worked in 'cathouses' located in rundown apartments in poor neighborhoods.

Court papers say that customers paid $30 for 15 minutes of sex. The women
would get $15 but were usually forced to give it to traffickers who had
smuggled them into the United States.

Raid: Thirteen men and women were charged with running a sex-trafficking ring that operated brothels and forced Mexican women to have sex with dozens of clients

Grave allegations: Authorities say some of the women were delivered to farms in New Jersey, while others worked in 'cathouses' located in dingy apartments in Queens and upstate New York

The young sex workers were driven to rural New Jersey, where their handlers
used threats to make them service 25 farmworkers a day.

Some of the women were confined to dingy brothels operating out of apartments
in Queens that advertised their services with ‘chica cards’ - business cards
passed out on street corners to attract customers. They were paid very little,
or nothing at all.

The Department of Homeland Security's Investigations division raided brothels in Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, and Queens in New York City.

In Yonkers, New York, two naked women wrapped in blankets were rushed out of an apartment that was being used as a brothel.

They also made arrests in Delaware and Maryland.

Their ordeal was detailed in a criminal complaint charging 13 people with
smuggling dozens into the U.S. forcing them into prostitution since at least 2008.

Some of the defendants were to appear Wednesday in federal court in
Manhattan to face multiple counts including sex trafficking and interstate
transportation for prostitution.

Among those arrested are: Isaias 
Flores-Mendez, 40; Bonifacio Flores-Mendez, 33, of Queens; Juana 
Lucas-Sanchez, 36, of Milford, Delaware; and David Vasquez-Medina, 28; 
Carlos Garcia-De La Rosa, 32.

The ring ‘lured their unsuspecting victims to the United States and then
consigned them to a living hell,’ U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a
statement.

Serious charges: If convicted, some of the defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison for sex trafficking

Brutal conditions: The prostitutes were often forced to give up all their earnings and faced beatings if they dared conceal some of the money

The investigation was among several aimed at ‘blockading the repugnant sex
trafficking corridor’ used to exploit victims from Tenancingo, Mexico, said
James Hayes, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York.

Tenancingo, an impoverished town in Tlaxcala state, has long been a
notorious haven for pimps who use a combination of threats, abuse and broken
promises of marriage and jobs to put innocent victims, some only in their
teens, on a path to sex slavery in Mexico City and in large cities north of the
border.

Most victims eventually manage to escape, authorities say in court papers.
But, they add, ‘without legal status in the United States, without family and
friends for support, without employment opportunities and as a result of the
trauma they suffered, victims sometimes return to prostitution.’

In interviews with investigators, one unidentified woman described how when
she refused to work at underground brothels in Queens and suburban Yonkers, she
and her child were locked out of their home on a cold winter night.

She also told authorities that her pimps, believing she was pregnant, forced
her to take drugs intended to induce a miscarriage, and that she was beaten
when she once tried to withhold some of her earnings.

Another woman recounted becoming romantically involved with a man who smuggled
her into the United States, only to learn he made a living delivering
prostitutes to New Jersey to have sex with farmworkers.

She said he used threats to force her into the sex trade for two years
before he was deported.

According to the complaint, the ring provided its victims with condoms and
birth control pills while making them have sex with up to 30 men a day. The men
paid $30 for 15 minutes. The women sometimes got a $15 cut but that usually
went to the traffickers.

If convicted, some of the defendants face a maximum sentence of life in
prison.

The evidence includes wiretaps of customers and pimps haggling over prices,
the complaint says.

‘What girls do you have?’ one customer asked.

‘From Salvador and Mexico.’

‘How do they look?’

‘They both look good.’

The pimp quoted a price of $70.

‘Can you do it for 60?’
