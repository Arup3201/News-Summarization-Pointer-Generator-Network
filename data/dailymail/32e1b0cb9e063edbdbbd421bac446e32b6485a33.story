A desperate husband has spoken of his despair at the disappearance of his real estate agent wife, who vanished showing a property to an unknown would-be buyer just as locals spotted a stranger pull up in a pick-up truck.

Beverly Carter, 49, disappeared from a foreclosed home in Scott, Arkansas, after going to an appointment with an unknown buyer on Thursday, sparking a huge search effort.

Her husband Carl Carter, who found her car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open, said 'I'm going to try to be strong as best I can - I just want my wife back'.

His plea came as one neighbor revealed he saw a 'skinny white man' pull up at the house in a pick-up truck around the time of the disappearance.

Hunt: Mrs Carter, a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas, has now been missing for three days

Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her.

Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.'

He could find no sign of her inside, and police and volunteers have been searching ever since.

The pick-up driver described has not been found by police, and it is unclear whether he was the buyer Mrs Carter was going to meet. 

Beverly Carter, 49, vanished from the property in Scott, near Little Rock, Arkansas, after meeting an unknown person at the address on Thursday afternoon.

She was reported missing by her husband Carl after she didn't make contact with her family for three and a half hours after the 5.30pm appointment.

Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash

When Carter went to the property to look for his wife, he found her car, a brown Cadillac, containing her pursue, outside of the house, which had a wide open door. There was no trace of her inside.

Police investigators say there was no evidence of a crime being committed. Mrs Carter is blonde, has green eyes, is 5' 2" tall and weighs around 145lbs, according to search effort descriptions.

Mrs Carter, who works for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was last seen wearing a black, sleeveless shirt and red shorts.

According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash.

Carter, who says it is extremely unusual for his wife not to stay in close contact, said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared.

Search: Mrs Carter's husband, Carl Carter, told how he went looking for his wife and found an empty home and an abandoned car

He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said "Yes." Then she sent another text that said, "My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."

'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said "Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends."'

'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.'

He told First Coast News: 'Her car was there, and the house was wide open, and I knew that something was wrong.'

Search: Police in Arkansas continued their search for Mrs Carter today

Left at the house: Mrs Carter's husband arrived at the home to find her new Cadillac - with custom plates - left outside, while the door of the house was open

The Pulaski County Sheriff's Office started its second day of searching this morning, and is urging landowners in the area to search their property in case she is there.

Colleagues described Mrs Carter as 'fun-loving' and 'the sunshine in the office', adding they will strengthen protections for estate agents heading out alone in future.

Anybody with information regarding the case can contact the sheriff's office on 501-340-6600.
