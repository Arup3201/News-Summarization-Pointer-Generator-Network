 It was the first mass market smartwatch, and now Pebble is set to fight back against the Apple and Google watches.

Pebble has revealed a new model is coming tomorrow, and will feature a colour screen.

The firm even accidentally leaked an image believed to show the watch on its website.

Is this the new Pebble? The firm accidentally revealed the image on the left, showing a colour screen. Its website currently shows a countdown clock for the new watch with the image on the right.

According to 9to5mac, the new watch is set to have a thinner design and a colour e-paper-like display.

It spotted an image showing off the watch on Pebble's own servers. 

'Now, thanks to an image hosted on Pebble’s own servers, we have a look at a device with a physical appearance matching the device we described. 

'The device looks to have a larger bezel, as well as buttons that are smaller compared to its predecessor.'

As we reported, the watch is going to be thinner than the current generation, but you can’t really see that based on this image alone. 

And while the new device will have a color display and a slimmer hardware profile, it’s said to have battery life that compares to the first generation Pebble. 

On the inside, the next Pebble is going to have a Cortex M4 processor and a 6-axis gyroscope. Unlike the Apple Watch, the new Pebble won’t have a touch screen, and its resolution is definitely on the low side compared to Apple’s upcoming device.

Compatibility: The smartwatch is compatible with Android 2.3+ and iOS 5+

Connectivity: The Pebble connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth

Messaging: Wearers can see texts, tweets, calls and app notifications – but they can’t use the watch to type messages or make calls, like with the Apple Watch, for example.

Battery: The battery lasts for between five and seven days on a single charge and can be recharged using a USB cable with a magnetic connector.

Tough: The watch is water resistant with a scratch and shatter-proof e-paper screen.

Screen: 144 x 168 pixels, measuring 3.2cm

Apps: The watch has a ‘thriving’ app store with staples like Twitter as well as fitness apps. Users can also create their own. The Pebble can store eight apps and watch faces at a time.

Extras: A vibrating silent alarm and hundreds of watch faces.

Colours: White, black, red, grey and orange.

Size: The watch is designed to fit most 2.2cm watch straps. It measures 5.2cm x 3.6cm x 1.15cm deep.

Weight: 38g

Price: £99 ($99 in the US) and £180 ($199) for the Steel model.

The current watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist, as well as see incoming calls, check the weather, access fitness apps and tell the time.

It is compatible with Apple and Android devices and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth so users don’t have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages, because they appear on the watch’s screen.

Pebble’s device is the second most funded product in Kickstarter history and the new Pebble Steel model is also now available in the UK for £180.

They are water resistant and have a battery that lasts for between five and seven days. In contrast, it’s predicted that the Apple Watch, which is due to be released early next year, will need to be recharged daily.

Firebox predicts that the already popular devices will be in demand from UK customers for Christmas, partly because they are more affordable than some rival offerings.

Since its US release last year, Pebble has developed its open-source platform so that anyone can create an app for the device and companies are offering fitness tracker apps like Jawbone and Misfit, so people can check their running pace without carrying another gadget, for example.

The watch has an e-paper display – like a miniature Kindle – so it can be easily read in bright sunlight, while a flick of the wrist illuminates the screen so it can be used in a the dark.
