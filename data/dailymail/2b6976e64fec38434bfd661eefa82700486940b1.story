A woman in her 20s somehow escaped unharmed when her car somersaulted off the road and into a pensioner's living room as he sat watching the National Lottery with his wife.

Shocking pictures show the the damage caused when the white Mini Cooper ploughed into the front of John and Pamela Clifford's £400,000 property in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, on Wednesday night.

The woman driver, who miraculously only suffered minor injuries, had somehow managed to travel 200 yards from the roadside to the house, smashing through a garden wall and even flattening a tree on the way.

The white Mini Cooper ploughed into the front of the £400,000 property in Sutton Coldfield but, incredibly, neither the driver of the elderly couple who lives inside were seriously hurt

The motorist, in her 20s, was taken by ambulance to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, as a precautionary check-up but had suffered only minor injuries

The driver had travelled 200 yards from the roadside, through a garden wall and into the house, leaving Mr Clifford's door lying on the ground and debris piled up in front of the property

Homeowner Mr Clifford, 76, said his house shook from the force of the devastating impact, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

Mr Clifford, a grandfather-of-four and part-time supply teacher, said he was 'just inches' from the destroyed wall, adding: 'We might not have won the lottery that night but in a way I think our luck was in because we could quite have easily been killed.'

He added: 'I was standing there checking my lottery numbers but none of them came up.

'The next thing I know there's a car smashing through my home.

'I just heard a massive crashing noise which sounded like an explosion - like a bomb going off.

'The whole of my house shook and shuddered from the force of the impact so I went outside to see what was going on.

Mr Clifford described the toilet wall as being 'completely trashed' and said he had 'popped in there moments before' the Mini Cooper came hurtling into his house

After leaving the road, the car carried on and ploughed through a wall before narrowly missing a block of flats next to the Clifford house and then finally coming to rest when it hit the home

 'I saw this woman standing on top of her car, which was on the side, just in absolute hysterics.

'She didn't seem injured which was incredible really. I don't even know how she got out the vehicle. It was a total wreck.

'The young lady had managed to travel about 200 yards from the road, across an area of lawn and on the way she even flattened a pretty big tree.

'I don't know how that didn't stop her but she's carried on and ploughed through a wall before narrowly missing a block of flats next to us.

'She's then smashed into our house. Looking at the impact, which is pretty high up she's hit the wall while in mid-air.

'That just makes it even more incredible that she wasn't injured and I'm pretty lucky to escape without a scratch as well.'

Reflecting on just how incredibly lucky he was, Mr Clifford said: 'If it had been seconds earlier or if I was standing a few inches to the left I wouldn't be here to tell the story.'

Speaking about the driver who caused all the damage Mr Clifford said: 'She didn't seem injured which was incredible really. I don't even know how she got out the vehicle. It was a total wreck.'

Sutton Coldfield Fire Station tweeted a dramatic image in the aftermath of the smash - which completely destroyed the porch of the house and left the inside of the property clearly visible.

The front door could also be seen lying amid rubble and the smashed-up vehicle on its side with it's airbags deployed. 

Meanwhile, the motorist, in her 20s, was taken by ambulance to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, as a precautionary check-up.

Mr Clifford said: 'The toilet wall was completely trashed and I had popped in there moments before the impact.

'But where I was standing when the car hit was a matter of inches from the wall - there was dust and rubble everywhere. My house was showered in bricks.

The car caused carnage as it knocked down a tree on its way across the road, seeminlgy somersaulting through the air and landing in Mr and Mrs Clifford's Sutton Coldfield house

'If it had been seconds earlier or if I was standing a few inches to the left I wouldn't be here to tell the story.

'God knows what had happened if my wife had not gone up to bed early to read as well, she would have been in the direct line of impact.'

Mr Clifford has lived at the property with his wife Pamela, 75, a retired library assistant, for 39 years.

He said he now expected the cost of the damage to run into thousands after his patio, front wall and downstairs toilet wall were completely destroyed.

The pensioner, who has two grown up sons Peter, 48 and Paul, 50, added: 'We're still waiting on the insurers but it's going to be a lot of money.

'The front door has gone, the patio had been demolished and there's just a gaping hole where anybody can see into our lounge.

'We need to get something done because out house is completely exposed.

'I just have no idea how the woman managed to travel so far from the road, somersault her car through the air and walk away with barely a scratch.

Bricks from the house walls were left strewn along the ground outside, ending up on Mr Clifford's car along with dust and dirt thrown up from the car's impact 

An out-of-date tax disc could be seen on the Mini Cooper car after it ploughed into the house and was left lying on its side, with its owner walking away surprisingly unhurt

An oxygen mask could be seen discarded in the driveway of John and Pamela Clifford's house after fire crews, police  and paramedics attended the scene at 10.30pm 

'She is a very lucky lady and so are we.

'The damage is bad but we have escaped with our lives.' 

Emergency services were called at around 10.30pm to find the detached house and car severely damaged.  

A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: 'We were called by the ambulance service to Thorn Hill Road at around 10.30pm last night following reports of a car in collision with a house.

'Officers dealt with the collision and it is believed that there were minor injuries caused to the driver.

'The driver was spoken to at the scene and enquiries into the circumstances around the collision continue.'

A spokesperson for West Midlands Fire Service said emergency crews spent an hour working at the scene.

He added: 'Both the homeowner and driver were lucky to escape the incident with minor injuries.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Two ambulances, a paramedic and a rapid response vehicle attended the scene at around 10.30pm.

'The patient was not seriously injured but was taken to Good Hope Hospital for a check up as a precautionary measure.'
