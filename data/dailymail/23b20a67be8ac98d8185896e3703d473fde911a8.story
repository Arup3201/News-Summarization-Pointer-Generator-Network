Heather Thorpe is the envy of thousands of women - because she had a labour that lasted just five minutes.

Her son Jonathon rushed into the world 'like a little Spitfire' in the 23-year-old's darkened bedroom.

He was born so quickly that his grandparents Marrion and Mark slept through almost all the early-morning drama at their home in Birmingham.

Awoken by Heather's screams, they rushed into her room and turned on the light to meet the new arrival, who was born ten days early.

'It was a five-minute labour,' Heather said.

'It was dark, I was alone. I did not call my mum and dad as I wanted to keep myself calm.

'I couldn't get up to put the light on but Jonathon cried straightaway and then mum and dad came in.

'I started breathing into his mouth to make sure his airways were clear. He was perfect.'

Heather's parents called for an ambulance after the birth and mum and baby were taken to Heartlands Hospital.

But Jonathon, who weighed 5lbs 7oz, and Heather were fine.

'It was relaxing, I felt contented I had done it myself,' she said.

'I gave birth alone in the dark. The natural instinct is you have to do what you have to do. He's my little munchkin.'

The quickfire birth happened at 4am on November 22.

Heather had gone to bed at 11pm the night before but her waters had not broken and she had a powerful contraction at 3.55am.

'I got the urge to push and he came into the world at 4am,' she said.

Marrion, 48, said: 'Heartlands confirmed it was a five-minute labour. He came out so quickly, like a little Spitfire. Heather is amazing. I'm bursting with pride.

'I still can't believe my grandson was born in this house.'
