Jason Thomas led police on a 102mph chase along the M5, finally fleeing the car abandoning his three children inside

Dramatic video footage has captured the moment a father smashed into a car at the end of a 102mph police chase, fleeing the vehicle leaving his three children in the back seat.

Jason Thomas is seen weaving in and out of traffic on the M5 near Worcester, reaching deadly speeds before flying down the hard shoulder.

The 33-year-old had just picked his children up from school on September 30 last year, when he was pursued by traffic officers.

The video, captured by the police, shows Thomas racing through a red light and smashing his silver Vauxhall Vectra into an oncoming car.

He is then seen jumping out of the car in an attempt to flee the scene on foot, abandoning his three screaming children, who were left in the back seat.

Officers wrestled the father to the ground as he ran across a dual carriageway.

Thomas was jailed for 22 months after admitting dangerous driving at Worcester Crown Court.

Judge Michael Cullum said Thomas had put the lives of 'hundreds' of people at risk. He told him: 'The high speed while undertaking on the hard shoulder is shocking.

'All the while, you were putting at risk of serious injury or worse, hundreds of people.

'In some ways, the most shocking thing about the whole episode was when, having crashed, the rear door of your vehicle opened and out stretched the arm of your young child.

'What sort of person drives like that with their own three children and their partner in that vehicle?'

Traffic police flashed Thomas, to signal to him that they wanted the 33-year-old to pull over

Instead of pulling over, the father led police on a chase reaching speeds of 102mph

Weaving in and out of cars, Thomas repeatedly flew down the hard shoulder in his silver Vauxhall Vectra

In his bid to get away, the 33-year-old careered through a set of red lights, colliding a car crossing the junction in the opposite direction

Sentencing Thomas, the judge said he had put the lives of 'hundreds' of people at risk

'You didn’t wait to see how the people in the other vehicle were - you didn’t care about that.

'You even ran away from your own family.'

Police flashed their lights at Thomas and indicated for him to stop.

The two-minute recording shows the Vectra tearing up the M5 near Worcester, dodging cars and attempting to run the chasing police car off the road.

Thomas leaves the motorway at junction four, where he hurtles along country lanes near Hagley, north Worcestershire.

After smashing into the back of another car, injuring an 80-year-old woman inside, Thomas jumped out of the car, fleeing on foot across a dual carriageway

As he fled, officers spotted the arm of a child from inside the car, discovering Thomas had abandoned his three children on the back seat

Officers detained Thomas 20 yards from his car. The 33-year-old admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for 22 months. It emerged it was his sixth conviction for dangerous driving and the 12th time he had been caught driving while he was disqualified

But just a few seconds later the children’s ordeal was over as Thomas slammed into the side of a Toyota, carrying a man with his 80-year-old mother - who was hurt in the crash.

Thomas, from Dudley, tried to flee on foot, but officers detained him 20 yards from his wrecked car.

The court heard it was Thomas’s sixth conviction for dangerous driving, and that Thomas was already driving whilst disqualified and without insurance.

He also had 11 previous convictions for driving while disqualified.

Thomas was jailed for 18 months for dangerous driving and four months consecutively for driving while disqualified.

He was also disqualified from driving for 10 years.
