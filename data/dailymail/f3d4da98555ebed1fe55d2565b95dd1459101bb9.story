A petite army wife has become the proud owner of Britain’s biggest fake breasts - which measure 30KK and contain five pints of silicone.

Debbie Delamar, 34 from Brecon, Pwoys, is just 5ft tall and has had three enlargement proceedures since the age of 28, taking her from her natural 30DD to 30FF and 30HH.

Many
 surgeons refused the third operation, but in May Debbie successfully found a doctor willing to carry it out for £8,000 at the private Highgate Hospital in 
London.

Fake assets: Debbie Delamar, 34, from Wales is the proud owner of Britain's biggest fake breasts, measuring 30KK

Glamour model: Mother-of-two Debbie is proud to have Britain's biggest fake boobs and charges £35 to send her fans topless photos

Up front: Debbie says: 'I don't think I'm a bad role model. We're responsible parents and it was never my intention to forge a glamour modelling career but I couldn't be happier'

She had the huge silicone implants - each containing 1,500cc or 2.6 
pints - specially made by a French company.

The mother-of-two's chest is now so big that she was unable to bring her hands together to clap at first.

And while Debbie loves having Britain’s biggest fake breasts, she admits they get in the 
way of work: at her job in a car-parts plant she has to sit further back 
from the assembly line than other women.

Debbie said: 'People stare at me wherever I go but I enjoy it. I love the fake look and want to be as big as possible. 

'I know I’m not a conventional army wife or mother, but I’m not hurting anyone.

Debbie's daughters, Sian, 15, and Katie, 12, have different opinions on their mother's assets. 'My oldest thinks it's great and just wants me to be famous but my youngest is more shy and a bit embarrassed by them,' says Debbie

Attention: Debbie has a devoted Twitter following. 'I receive hundreds of messages a day from across the world and there are even fan pages set up in my name,' she says

Showing off her assets: 'I really like the fake artificial look,' says Debbie. 'Some people like blonde hair or black hair. I like big fake boobs'

'I really just like the fake artificial look. Some people like blonde hair or black hair - I like big fake boobs.

'It was never intentional to be the biggest in Britain, but it just sort of happened.

'They don’t really get in the way anymore as I have adapted to them, but the first time they did was when I was at a concert with my daughters.

'I went to clap my hands and I realised I couldn’t anymore.

'I don’t 
have to worry about them getting in the way around the house as my 
husband does all the ironing and things, but at work I do have to sit a 
few more inches away from the desk.'

Size 8 
Debbie, from Brecon, Powys, had her first breast augmentation in 2008 in
 Cyprus, where her sergeant husband Rob, 35, was posted with the Duke of
 Lancaster Regiment.

The £3,800 operation took her from a 30DD to a 30FF but less than a year later she forked out another £3,200 to take her to HH.

Consequences: Having Britain's biggest fake breasts come at a price. 'I was at a concert with my daughters and I went to clap my hands and I realised I couldn't anymore,' says Debbie

Controversial: Debbie, pictured here, says she was refused a third operation - which would take her from 30HH to her current 30kk - by most surgeons

Debbie’s daughters, Sian, 15, and Katie, 12, have different opinions on their mother’s assets.

She says: 'My oldest thinks it’s great and just wants me to be famous but my youngest is more shy and a bit embarrassed by them.

'I
 don’t think I’m a bad role model. We’re responsible parents and it was 
never my intention to forge a glamour modelling career, but I couldn’t 
be happier.'

Debbie has gained thousands of fans from all over the world via her Twitter feed and now charges £35 for topless pictures.

Debbie Delamar's implants together weigh a back-breaking 7lbs, or 3.175kgs. That is equivalent to: - One and a quarter bags of 2.5kg spuds- A small shark- A bowling ball- A three-month German Shepherd- Two house bricks- An adult cat- Seven 1lb bags of sugar- Two boxes of wine- Eight rugby balls- An Xbox 360

She continued: 'I don’t mind the attention - I’m used to it now. I receive hundreds of messages a day from across the world and there’s even fan pages set up in my name.

'I never intended to fall into glamour modelling, but it just happened after fans found me online.

'The reaction I get is varied. Sometimes people will look and then have to look back again to check what they have seen.

'Sometimes when men will be looking and their wives or girlfriends will catch them and they will get a bit of a telling off.

'I don’t have that many celebrity style icons but I do like to model my look on some people in the adult entertainment industry. I used to like Jordan, but she’s just not big enough now.'

She added: 'I think I’ve got the biggest silicone implants in Britain but a woman in America has bigger saline implants than me.

'I’m happy with the way they look now and have no plans to go bigger. I don't think my hubby would be as understanding the fourth time around.

'If I did go bigger I would need to change the fill of the implant to a saline implant.I  would have to go over to America for that.

'Maybe I would do it, never say never.'

With a height of just 5' - 60' - that makes her nearly half as wide as she is tall. Debbie's other vital statistics are 25 inch waist and 32 inch hips.

At their largest point they have a total circumference of nearly 50 inches - making Debbie almost 2ft wide from her back to the front of her chest.

Debbie said despite her out-of-proportion look, she doesn't have any trouble keeping balance.

'The only time I have trouble keeping balance is when I'm on a photo shoot in seven inch heels - and I think that's understandable,' she said.
