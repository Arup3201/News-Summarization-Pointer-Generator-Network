Claims: Sexual allegations about 81 BBC staff have been reported since the Jimmy Savile scandal came to light

Sexual allegations about 81 BBC staff have been reported since the Jimmy Savile scandal came to light - with almost half still working for the corporation.

New figures show that 40 of the people whose names have come up since October 3 are either current staff or contributors to the organisation.

The remainder have either died or no longer work for the BBC.

Data released as a result of a Freedom Of Information request shows that just ten of the cases involving present staff or contributors are still ongoing with investigations by the police or the BBC

Of the 81 people about whom allegations have been made, 54 are physical with 23 still involved with the corporation.

The remainder relate to verbal and 'non-physical' incidents.

In all there have been 152 sexual allegations made about BBC staff and contributors, with 52 of those still involved with the organisation.

The Savile scandal erupted last year and sent the BBC into crisis over its handling of the issue.

Director general George Entwistle resigned as a result of the fall-out only 54 days into the job.

Earlier this month the TV and radio presenter Stuart Hall admitted indecent assaults on girls as young as nine and will be sentenced for his crimes next month.

The 83-year-old was described as an 'opportunistic predator'.

The BBC published a report earlier this month which revealed there had been 37 formal complaints of sexual harassment over the past six years out of a total workforce of 22,000 staff and 60,000 freelancers.

As part of the report being published the corporation also revealed that it will now drop gagging orders from all BBC contracts in the future.

There has been deep concern in the past that the BBC has been able prevent people speaking out about their treatment at the corporation as a result of these clauses in their contracts.

While the report said sexual 
harassment was much less common than bullying, it did admit there was 
evidence that some individuals working at the BBC had made ‘unwanted and
 inappropriate sexual advances’ to their colleagues or staff.

In some cases people had been given warnings about their behaviour but then gone on to repeat their harassment of the person.

Of the 40 current staff and 
contributors, 25 have been reported to police with allegations against 
15 of them not deemed to be criminal.

A BBC spokesman said the corporation had been 'appalled' by the allegations of harassment and abuse that have emerged.

He went on: 'We have launched a series of reviews that aim to understand if there are any issues with the current culture of the BBC or the historic culture and practices from as far back as 1965 to see what lessons can be learned to prevent this happening again.

'As part of these reviews the BBC is conducting extensive searches of its records and has asked BBC staff and contributors past and present to share any information that might be useful. Their contributions are vital and we are grateful for them.'
