An 999 call handler who was sending an ambulance to a nursery where a baby girl was choking ended the call by saying: 'Jeez, stop giving me information', an inquest heard.

North West Ambulance Service emergency medical dispatcher Aaliyah Ormerod made the comment after she put down the phone, unaware she was still being recorded.

The 999 call was played to a jury at the inquest into the death of nine-month-old Millie Thompson, who died at Ramillies Hall private nursery in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, in October last year.

An emergency medical dispatcher has admitted she made two 'fundamental' errors while responding to a call as Millie Thompson was choking

A member of staff at the nursery called for an ambulance and told Ms Ormerod that Millie had begun choking and crying and had turned 'a bit purple' after she ate shepherd's pie for lunch.

The call came to an end after Ms Ormerod took details of Millie's condition, gave the caller instructions and told her an ambulance was on its way.

Ms Ormerod said as she ended the call: 'Bye bye... Jeez, stop giving me information.'

An inquest at Oldham Magistrates’ Court was told nursery staff and paramedics were unable to save Millie, from Bramhall, Cheshire.

Paramedic Paul Williams said: 'I don't think there was anything else I could have done.'

In a statement read to the court, Ms Ormerod admitted she did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation and did not stay on the line to monitor Millie’s condition.

She said she began to ask a series of scripted questions when she received the call.

She was given the address of the scene and was then informed that a baby was choking, crying, still breathing but was going 'a bit purple'.

Ms Ormerod continued to ask further scripted questions and learned the child was not breathing normally after she had choked.

She
told a nursery assistant not to slap Millie on the back any longer 
because that could cause a further lodging of any food stuck down the 
throat.

Then continuing to follow the prompted questions, she advised the youngster should not eat or drink anything.

She should also be rested in the most comfortable position on her side in case she vomited.

Ms Ormerod ended the call by asking the school to ring back immediately if anything changed.

Following a review of the call, she admitted she had made the 'fundamental errors'.

She stated: 'When told the patient was going purple, I did not click this indicated breathing problems.'

This should have generated a more immediate response and not a continuation of the scripts she followed, she said.

She went on: 'I should have stayed on the line to monitor the patient’s breathing and not exit the call.'

Explaining that she had suffered a stillbirth herself, she said the thought that her actions could have contributed to a death 'has devastated me'.

The inquest heard how the 999 call hander made mistakes in how she graded the call last October

She added she considered it an 'isolated error' and said she thought the automatic prompting system should be improved.

Ms Ormerod, who was not present at the hearing, is still employed by the same ambulance service but now works in a different control room.

Addressing the jury on the opening day of the inquest yesterday, Millie’s mother Joanne said all she wanted to know was how her 'perfectly healthy' daughter did not come home from the nursery.

Millie started coughing and crying during her mashed feed in a high chair before her lips turned blue.

Nursery staff performed first aid on the youngster as they waited for emergency assistance on October 23.

An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later but Millie had gone into cardiac arrest and less than a hour later she was pronounced dead at Stepping Hill Hospital.

A recording of the 999 phone call was played to the jury.

At the end of the call, when the operator says goodbye, she is still being recorded as she says: 'Jeez, stop giving me information.'

South Manchester coroner John Pollard said he expected her employers to take action over that comment.

Earlier a nursery assistant told her: 'She’s crying, she’s breath..she’s crying and she seems to be breathing. But she seems to be choking a little bit. She’s still... she just crying at the minute and it seems to have been happening for three minutes now, she seems to be going a little bit discoloured, a little bit purply.'

Angela Lee, section manager in the emergency control room, said the call operator should have graded a 'red response' of an immediate threat to life.

The inquest heard how that requires a vehicle response within eight minutes.

Asked why Ms Ormerod had not chosen that option, Ms Lee said: 'The call operator did not follow her training and did not identify Millie had ineffective breathing at the start of the call.

'The word "purple" or "blue" or "gasping for breath" acts as a trigger for an immediate red response before any more questions are asked.'

She explained that made no practical difference in this case as to how quickly the ambulance arrived but a rapid response car might have got there one or two minutes sooner.

Ms Lee said the operator did not have an explanation as to why she did not stay on the line but said she felt she had been 'bombarded with details'.

Mr Pollard said: 'What I cannot understand is there can only be in my mind no more important a call than a baby choking?'

The witness said: 'I totally agree with you. She should have stayed on the line. It’s unacceptable.'

The coroner suggested: 'This was a complete aberration.'

Ms Lee replied: 'Yes.'

The inquest heard that so far no disciplinary proceedings have been taken against the call operator.

All the service’s emergency medical despatchers - who are not medically trained - have since received retraining on calls regarding choking.

Ms Ormerod returned to work about six months ago in the same role, although a doctor ruled her medically unfit to give evidence this week at the inquest or in the foreseeable future.

Earlier, paramedic Paul Williams told the hearing he 'immediately knew' it was not a normal choking incident when he arrived at the nursery.

'It appeared more serious,' he said.

He described Millie as looking 'floppy and pale' with 'quite blue-ish lips'.

Her heart was not beating in the ambulance and he failed with various attempts to resuscitate her before a decision was made to rush her to hospital.

Millie had no signs of life on arrival at Stepping Hill Hospital and was pronounced dead soon afterwards.

Emergency medical technician Susan Richardson arrived at the nursery in a second, back-up ambulance.

She recalled a conversation with a woman wearing a dark suit who was beside the vehicle as other medics battled to save Millie's life.

'I asked her what happened,' she said.

'She said that Millie had had a bit of a coughing do and had gone downhill.'

Asked if that woman had been forthcoming with answers to her questions, the witness said: 'She was very non-committal.

'The police had arrived by this time. She seemed to be looking down the driveway to see what was going on.

'I asked the lady if she (Millie) had any medical history, any underlying problems. She said "No, I don't know". She was quite off.'

The hearing continues next Tuesday.
