Pregnant Chelsea Clinton beamed Tuesday night as she was honored for her charity work in New York City.

The 34-year-old daughter of former President Bill Clinton and presidential contender Hillary Clinton rubbed shoulders with fellow political royalty at the Riverkeeper Fisherman's Ball at Chelsea Piers.

The expectant mother posed on the red carpet with Robert F Kennedy Jr., son of the late Bobby Kennedy, and one of the events co-chairs.

Chelsea was honored at the event for her work promoting clean and safe drinking water around the world, especially in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in New York.

The beginnings of a bump? Chelsea Clinton attended a charity event in New York City Tuesday night nearly two weeks after she announced her pregnancy

'A #CleanRiver as important as ever for #NYC â€“ thanks to @riverkeeper for all the work you do & for the #BigFish recognition for @ClintonFdn!' Chelsea tweeted about the honor.

America is on baby watch after the former first daughter announced she was pregnant earlier this month at an event at the Lower Eastside Girls Club.

She told the assembled guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.'

There was a cheer from the audience as she revealed the news, before she continued: 'I certainly feel all the better whether itâ€™s a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders. . .

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Chelsea is likely to be around 13 or 14 weeks along; most women wait until the start of the second trimester to announce their pregnancy because the chance of miscarriage is greatly reduced.

Hillary Clinton followed the announcement with an excited Twitter post. She wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!'

Husband Bill echoed her words with a tweet of his own, reading: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!'

A grandchild has long been on the mind of the former president, who adopted his vegan diet so he could live long enough to see Chelsea's baby, his physician consultant recently revealed.

'I asked him why... and he said, "I want to live long enough to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see my grandkids born and grow up,"' Dr Dean Ornish told the Huffington Post.
