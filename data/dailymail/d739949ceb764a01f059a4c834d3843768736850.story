Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley has criticised Rio Ferdinand for treating the anti-racism organisation as a 'punchbag' and for what they consider damaging inaccuracies in his autobiography.

In #2sides, QPR defender Ferdinand labels Kick It Out 'useless', accuses it of 'pure lip service' and of a lack of support during John Terry's trial for racially abusing his young brother Anton in 2012.

But Ouseley believes Ferdinand's anger should be directed 'at the real power brokers' and not Kick It Out who, he says, supported the family as much as possible.

He told the Guardian: 'Ferdinand is selling a book of trivia. Meanwhile, the bigger issues remain untouched.'

Kick It Out also dispute the former England captain's claims that they refused to attend court with the family – saying a member of the organisation was present each day.

Ferdinand also says his mum Janice kicked representatives of the organisation out of the home after they refused to wear T-shirts in court, but Kick It Out deny there was any meeting or outburst.

'Unfortunately we are the punchbag for some people and it's easy to have a punchbag like us. We're a soft target and the easiest target. 

'Rio should not be attacking the weakest point – the people who are actually supporting him – but the people who were not supporting him. I would have thought the whole of football should have turned up at that court case wanting justice.

Anton's older brother Ferdinand partnered John Terry at the heart of England's defence for several years

Kick It Out's slogan is 'Tackling Racism and Discrimination'. The organisation was launched in 1993 by the Commission for Racial Equality and the PFA.

According to its website, it 'is primarily a campaigning organisation which enables, facilitates and works with the football authorities, professional clubs, players, fans and communities to tackle all forms of discrimination.' 

'The FA, the Premier League, the clubs, all the people with the real power, not us, and who missed an opportunity and didn't mobilise. 

'We are a soft target, but I don't hear criticism of David Bernstein or Richard Scudamore. We did as much as we could but what it shows is a complete lack of understanding about our actual powers.

'Nobody can ever say a player has come to us and we have not supported them. Not one. We have always done what we could whereas there are an awful lot of other people who haven't.'

In #2sides, Ferdinand also criticised Kick It Out for not wearing T-shirts in support of the family outside the courtroom. Kick It Out's representative Danny Lynch attended court in a suit and Ouseley says the criticism was 'pathetic'.

He said: 'It [the criticism] is absolutely pathetic. He was representing Kick It Out and we expected him to dress in a correct way and respect the court. He was there to observe in a professional capacity.' 

Ferdinand's camp had no comment when contacted by MailOnline.

Herman Ouseley joined the House of Lords in 2001 and is a cross-party peer.

As well as being chairman of Kick It Out, the 69-year-old chairs the Football Association Race Equality Advisory Group and is an FA council member. 

The south Londoner supports his local club Millwall but also reportedly has a soft spot for Manchester United.

He added later: 'We don't like being Rio Ferdinand's punchbag. It was very unfair. I have no hang-ups about being criticised but it has to be based on fair and accurate information.

'I just want to put the record straight. We had someone there with the family in court every day - Anton Ferdinand's club [QPR] wasn't there, his union wasn't there every day, but we were. Was Rio himself even there?

'We gave as much support as we could give, we could not do any more, we had no power to do so. We spoke to the club and the police and had meetings. If the clubs had acted properly in the Terry case and the Suarez case we would not have had all this grief.'

Kick It Out had had a number of meetings with the Ferdinand family before the trial, but decided it could not agree to their request for their staff to wear campaigning T-shirts in court.

Ouseley said he had been happy for Ferdinand and Jason Roberts to later boycott the Kick It Out T-shirts because it was only when people 'put their heads above the parapet' that changes were made.

He added: 'I want more to speak out and challenge inequality. You only see action when people speak out - it was only when Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in Italy that FIFA sat up and took notice.'

Ouseley also expanded on his reasons for resigning from the FA Council, revealing it came after then FA chairman Bernstein refused to issue an apology on behalf of the governing body for the way it had handled the Terry case.

He said: 'I wanted the chairman to issue a full apology. They mishandled those cases and caused so much grief and because he refused to do, I relinquished my place on the FA Council.

'The Ferdinand family were severely abused, I was severely abused - I got hundreds of abusive emails - and they deserved a full apology.'

Ouseley was also highly critical of Liverpool and their then manager Kenny Dalglish after Luis Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra. 

The Kick It Out chairman added: 'Liverpool could have been sanctioned three times over the Suarez incident, Kenny Dalglish's behaviour was appalling.

'Andre Villas-Boas was manager of Chelsea and kept on saying Terry would always be their captain whatever the outcome.

'The FA only did something about him being England captain when they were about to go off to Euro 2012 and the whole thing was incendiary and very toxic. They hid behind the police inquiry but it is the FA that regulates football and the Ferdinand family were given so much grief.

'We have moved on but you have to purge yourself of these errors.

'I think a lot more people have confidence now, at least people know the FA will investigate everything now.'
