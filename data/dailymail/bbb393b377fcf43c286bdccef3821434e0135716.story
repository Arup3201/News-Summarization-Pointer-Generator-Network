Hillary Clinton's new book 'Hard Choices' is a 'bomb', according to a publishing source.

The former first lady's memoir - detailing her time as secretary of state under Obama - has sold just 60,000 hardcover copies and 24,000 e-books, the source told The Weekly Standard.

The results come after publisher Simon & Schuster's 'hoping and praying' that 150,000 print copies would be sold in the first week after the book went on sale on June 10, the source added.

'Between us, they are nervous at S&S,' the source said. 'Sales were well below expectations and the media was a disaster... It's a bomb, but it will be interesting to see how they spin it.'

'Struggling': Hillary Clinton's new book has shown disappointing early sales, according to a publishing source

A million copies were reportedly shipped when the book went on sale - meaning that the actual number sold is less than 10 per cent sell-through of what they sent, the source said, adding: 'They will be lucky to sell 150,000 total lifetime.'

But the book has reached the top of the Barnes & Noble best-seller list by selling 24,000 copies, BuzzFeed reported, citing the company's Nielsen BookScan sales numbers.

Despite this, it has still not performed as well as Clinton's 2003 book, 'Living History', which sold a million copies in its first month - and more than 40,000 copies in just 24 hours, a store record.

By comparison, the recent BookScan numbers show the company sold just over half that amount in hardback copies of 'Hard Choices' in its first five days.

'Hard 
Choices' debuted at No. 1 on the bookseller's hardcover best-seller list
 - but despite this apparent success, The Weekly Standard source said 
sales did not meet expectations.

'The book will probably debut on the best-seller list at No. 1 and then fall like a rock,' a source said.

The New York Times best-seller list will be published on Wednesday evening.

In demand? Shoppers reach for copies of 'Hard Choices' at an event in Washington on Friday. Since its release last week, she has held more than 10 events to promote the book across six cities

Clinton began her book tour at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan a week ago and more than 1,000 people lined around the block and bought copies.

She has since held 10 events in six cities, including Chicago and Philadelphia.

The 656-page book recounts her four years as President Obama's secretary of state.

Democrats hope the book and its corresponding tour will preface another White House bid in 2016.

By contrast, 'Living History' told a more personal tale of her childhood, her relationship with Bill Clinton and their time in the White House - including the Monica Lewinsky scandal and her husband's impeachment. It was her first major account of the events.
