A convicted murderer has been awarded nearly £5000 in compensation as the failure of Scottish courts to hear his appeal in ‘reasonable time’ was found to have breached his human rights.

William Beggs, known as the ‘limbs-in-the-loch’ killer was jailed for life in 2001 for murdering 18-year-old Barry Wallace in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.

A jury found Mr Beggs, 49, guilty of raping and killing the teenager before cutting up his body and dumping his limbs and torso in Loch Lomond and his head in the sea.

Awarded: Convicted murdered William Beggs will be paid nearly £5,000 in compensation for 'damage caused' by his lengthy appeals process

Mr Beggs has appealed against his conviction, which will see him spend at least 20 years behind bars, a process which has taken over ten years.

The European Court of Human Rights today published a ruling that awarded Mr Beggs £4,800 (€6,000) after finding that the lengthy appeals process breached the European Convention on Human Rights.

Scottish courts were found to have broken article 6.1 of the convention which states: ‘In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.’

Guilty: Mr Beggs is appealing against his 2001 conviction over the rape and murder of Barry Wallace, 18

The award is made up of £1,600 (€2,000) for non-pecuniary damage, such as pain and suffering, and £3,200 (€4,000) for legal costs and expenses.

Mr Beggs has failed in previous appeals to overturn his conviction at the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court in Edinburgh. His entire appeal proceedings have lasted ten years and three months.

A summary of the European Court ruling stated: ‘Although the case was complex, this did not in itself justify appeal proceedings which lasted over ten years.

'A substantial proportion of the delay had been caused by the applicant’s own conduct.

‘However, there were also periods of 
inactivity where the courts had failed to take steps to progress matters
of their own motion.

'This led the Court to find a violation of the 
right to trial within a reasonable time.

‘As
regards Mr Beggs’ numerous challenges to the fairness of the trial 
proceedings, the Court found that his trial was fair and declared all of
his complaints inadmissible.’

Beggs first made an application to the
European Court of Human Rights in June 2006.

He was seeking £16,400 in 
respect of non-pecuniary damage and more than £10,000 for legal 
expenses.

Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out 
with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock.

A jury found Beggs took the teenager to 
his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault. He then murdered
him and cut up his body.

The killer dumped the limbs and torso in Loch Lomond and the head in the sea off the Ayrshire coast.

Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands.

After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial.

He was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder at the High Court in Edinburgh in October 2001.
