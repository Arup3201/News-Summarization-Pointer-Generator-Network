David Haye took a break from public training sessions and promotional events to travel to sunnier shores.

He added that he was relishing the opportunity to get some sun of his face on Twitter.

The former Cruiser and Heavyweight world champion was in high spirits as he travelled abroad. He even made sure he put time aside to take in the new James Brown movie.

Haye has not ruled out a return to professional boxing in 2015 despite a lengthy absence

Haye said a smooth flight was made even more enjoyable by the lovely cabin crew, and thanked the staff for their hospitality.

The 'Hayemaker' has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012. 

In 2014, he was expected to fight Tyson Fury but he had to pull out on two occasions. Doctors have advised Haye to retire from boxing.
