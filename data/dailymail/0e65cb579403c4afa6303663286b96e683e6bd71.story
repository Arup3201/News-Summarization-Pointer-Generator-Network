The University of Alabama football fan who poisoned rival team Auburn University's landmark oak trees will not be making an appearance at an upcoming charity event after organizers received death threats on social media.

It appears the roots of Auburn fans' hatred of Harvey Updyke, 65, are deep and they aren't willing to let bygones be bygones, even in for a good cause.

The September 29 event, planned by former Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron, his wife, former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb, and his mother Dee Dee Bonner, is to raise awareness and funds for children's cancer.

Tree change: Following his release from prison for poisoning Auburn University oak trees, Harvey Updyke moved to Louisiana. His upcoming appearance in Mobile, Alabama for a charity event has been cancelled after organizers received death threats

Updyke poisoned the beloved oak trees at Toomer's Corner on the Auburn campus after they beat Alabama in 2010.

Updyke was arrested after a man calling himself 'Al from Dadeville' - Updyke's middle name is Almorn - phoned Paul Finebaum's radio show claiming he poured herbicide around the 130-year-old oaks after Auburn's win over rival Alabama during the 2010 national championship season. The caller signed off by saying, 'Roll Damn Tide.'

He served six months in jail for the crime and was released last spring.

Attendees at the charity event would have had the opportunity to dunk Updyke in a tank of water or throw a pie in the face in exchange for a donation to Roses for Linda, a charity that helps families with transportation costs to visit dying loved ones.

However, it became apparent that Auburn fans wanted to hit Updyke with more than just pies.

Bonner told ESPN that she had received 'death threats and other ugly messages on social media.'

'It seems to be taking away from the primary purpose, which is raising awareness for children's cancer,' she said.

A Twitter account called All_Auburn tweeted, 'Ol' Harvey getting death threats? What the hell did they expect. How many bricks can you put in a pie?'

Updyke now lives in Louisiana and is banned from attending any college sporting event for life. He had to pay almost $800,000 to Auburn University.
