Zambia overcame one of its worst sporting tragedies after securing its first ever African Cup of Nations in a penalty shoot out last night.

The victory in Libreville, Gabon, came just miles from the scene where almost the entire Zambian national team was killed in a plane crash 19 years ago just off the coast.

Last week, the current players laid flowers on a stretch of sand in the Gabon capital in memory of the 25 players and officials who were killed soon after their plane took off in 1993.

It was the team's first game in Libreville since the fated plane crash and their emotional victory sparked scenes of jubilation and sorrow in Lusaka.

Herve Renard, Zambia coach, said: 'There was a sign of destiny, a force within us. Maybe it was meant to be.

'I can't explain it, honestly I can't explain it. Something was written in the stars. It was not me.'

Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene added: 'That's (the plane crash) the thing that's been driving us through the tournament. We have been thinking about that since we went into camp.

'It's one of those games. We were playing against big names but... we had to do it. The team spirit and the brotherhood in the team was the key for us.'

The team had pledged to return to Libreville and win their first major trophy to honour those who died in the crash.

But they were firm underdogs for the final against the Ivory Coast, who included Premier League stars Didier Drogba, Kolo Toure and Gervinho among their squad.

The match finished 0-0 after extra time, with Chelsea striker Drogba missing a penalty in normal time.

Zambia emerged victorious 8-7 in a penalty shootout to seal their first African Cup of Nations.

'Chipolopolo' midfielder Isaac Chansa, who gave away the penalty during the game, said: 'We were not the favourites of the final, obviously, but we believed in ourselves as players.

'It was written somewhere, you could see that from the miss of Drogba.'

Ivory Coast coach Francois Zahoui said: 'Zambia really believed in their victory. What else can I tell you?

'It's a very big disappointment. We didn't expect such a difficult game from the Zambians.'

In 1993, the plane carrying the Zambian national team ditched into the Atlantic Ocean as they headed to a World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Dakar. Everyone on board was killed, including five members of the crew.

An official investigation concluded that the pilot of the aircraft had shut down the wrong engine after fire broke out. It found that pilot fatigue and an instrument error had led to the accident.

Members of the national team who were killed were buried in 'Heroes' Acre', outside the Independence Stadium in the Zambia capital Lusaka.

Kalusha Bwalya, the president of the Zambian football federation and a member of the 1993 team who was not on the flight, lead the current team at the memorial event last week and lifted the trophy as the team celebrated.
