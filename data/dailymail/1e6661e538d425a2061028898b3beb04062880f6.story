Prince William has become the most popular royal in recent history, according to a new poll.

The 30-year-old is, remarkably, streaks ahead of the Queen, who celebrated her Diamond Jubilee this year, wife Kate and even his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Prince Harry is rated the third most popular royal, demonstrating just how important the younger royals have already become when weighing up the future of the monarchy.

Well-liked: Nine out of ten people are satisfied with the way the Queen (left) performs her job, but the Duke of Cambridge Prince William (right) is the most popular royal, a poll showed today

It also suggests a desire, particularly 
among younger people, for the House of Windsor to skip a generation, 
with the Queen being followed by her grandson rather than her son and 
heir, Prince Charles.

Asked which members of the Royal 
family they liked best, the 64-year-old future king was rated by just 21
 per cent of respondents, a drop of more than half since 1984, making 
him fifth in the 'rankings'.

The poll was carried out King's College London/Ipsos MORI ahead of a debate on the changing nature of the monarchy later this week.

William was rated the most popular royal by 62 per cent of respondents, the Queen by 48 and Prince Harry by 36. William's wife, Kate, was rated fourth with 23 per cent.

The Duchess of Cornwall scored just two 
per cent, second from bottom after Prince Edward who was rated by just 
one per cent of those quizzed. Princess Diana's highest score over the 
past 30 years was 47 per cent.

Professor of public opinion and political
 analysis at King's College, Roger Mortimore, said: 'A lot of people would like 
the idea of William succeeding straight away. He is young and good 
looking and popular.

'Young people can see something of themselves in William and Kate. They can see the monarchy looking more modern than it did beforehand'

'I think young people can see something of themselves in William and Kate. They can see the monarchy looking more modern than it did beforehand.'

The Queen does, however, end her jubilee year with nine out of ten Britons saying they are satisfied with the way she is doing her job and 79 per cent in favour of retaining the monarchy.

Amid the continuing debate over how much the monarchy costs taxpayers - Â£31million this year plus the bill for their security - 52 per cent say their funding should be cut.
