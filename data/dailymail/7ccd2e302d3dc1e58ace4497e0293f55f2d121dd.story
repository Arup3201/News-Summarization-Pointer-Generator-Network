Di Coke, pictured on a Sorrento trip she won, with husband Rob and son Ryland, has become so successful at competitions she now funds her life entirely through her winnings 

Di refuses to buy items and has raked in a staggering £255,000 of prizes thanks to her competition addiction and she has no plans to stop.

Di, who is mother to four-year-old Ryland, said: 'I have got to the stage when I can fund my life through entering competitions, which is amazing.

'I've had Christmas sorted since the beginning of the year, and I have a huge stock pile of presents which I stash away all year round.'

Di's first big win was an all expenses paid trip to Iceland in 1997, which she won after entering a competition hosted by Smirnoff Ice Vodka.

Di said: 'It was a fantastic trip and my first big win. It really gave me a taste for a winning lifestyle so I started entering more and more competitions.

'I soon learnt the tips and tricks to win and it's all about where people find the competitions and how much effort needs to be put in.

'As a rule, it's better to enter the competitions which take more time and effort as less people are likely to enter.

Di will scour the internet finding competitions, as well as ringing up phone-ins, and filling out newspaper quizzes (left), entering over 400 competitions a week, receiving prizes nearly daily (right)

Di spends around two hours a day entering competitions, which can be as simple as sharing a link on social media, or something more time consuming such as taking fun photos and she shares her experiences and tips on her blog, Superlucky.me.

Di's hobby, which has now become her career, has allowed her to try a whole range of experiences 

Over the past years Di has managed to win a whole host of electricals including five iPods, two Xboxes, two computers and three digital cameras, as well as three televisions in just this year alone.

Total: £25,500

Di's biggest win was a £13,000 VW Beetle but she has also blagged all inclusive trips around the world to destinations such as Iceland, Japan, Paris, Antiga and Spain.

Di even managed to blag £7,500 cash which helped pay for her wedding as well as a flying lesson and Glastonbury tickets.

Di said: 'My favourite competitions are the ones which my family can get involved in too. I like the competitions which my son Ryland can take part in, because it means I'm enjoying time with my family as well as having the chance to win a prize.

'I am in the process of putting together an e-Book about how my hobby turned into my job and I want people to realise that entering competitions can really make a difference to their life.

'Luckily, my husband has a good sense of humour when it comes to my comping and it makes life more exciting.'

Di said: 'It's a fabulous feeling to get the phone call to say you have won big.

'I look forward to the postman turning up to see what he has for me in the post.

'And it's great that I can treat my family and friends as well. I've won three TVs this year and I happily gave one to my parents and one to my niece.

'I have managed to kit out my whole house, get toys and clothes for my son and even take my family on amazing holiday every year, all for free.

'All I need now is a new kitchen, so I'm working on a few competitions which will help me get one hopefully.

And it's not just magazine competitions and Facebook giveaways, Di has won £10,000 from game shows over the years including Supermarket Sweep and the National Lottery Show, 1 vs 100.

Di said: 'It's such an exciting thing to do and I am totally addicted. Each win is fantastic and some of the prizes have been life-changing.

'I want people to realise how easy it can be to win on competitions and how much fun it can be too.' 

1. Be choosy

Di said: 'Decide what you want to win and make a wish list of prizes – from small things like vouchers and tickets to big things like a holiday or a kitchen. If you focus on finding and entering competitions to win those prizes, you'll find the hobby more manageable.

'The first step to winning those dream prizes is to find relevant companies on the internet, Facebook and Twitter – follow them, like them and join their email lists so you'll be the first to hear about new competitions.'

2. Get a new email address

Di advises competition wannabes to set up a new email account especially for comping- to filter out the hundreds of emails compers will received when they enter.

3. Always look for the word 'win'

Di said: 'Whether I'm in the supermarket, on the train, in WHSmith or in a waiting room, I always look out for the magic word - win. You'll be surprised where you find competitions – on products, in magazines, on bus stops… If you have a smartphone you can enter most comps there and then.

'You can also use your phone to search Twitter or Google for comps if you find yourself waiting around – you can always favourite or bookmark them to enter later on.'

4. Put the effort in

Di said: 'The majority of people who enter competitions don't like competitions which take a lot of creativity or effort, but these are the best ones to enter because they offer the best chance of winning.

'If something takes a bit more effort, often you may be the only entrant!'

5. Go local

Di said finding low entry competitions is the key to winning lots and advises checking local magazines, newspapers and shopping centres.

Di said: 'My top tip is to tune in to your local radio stations as the text and phone-in comps get very few entries!'
