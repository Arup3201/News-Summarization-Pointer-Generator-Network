A man was so against his girlfriend moving into his home that he torched the property - leaving his pet dog to burn to death inside.

Kent Perusse, 48, was standing outside his home watching it burn on December 14, covered in soot, when police arrived.

The wooden-framed house in Tampa Bay, Florida burned quickly as it had been doused in an accelerant, fire investigators discovered.

Perusse told officers at the scene, 'I did it', according to the Tampa Bay Times.

He added that the reason he set fire to the home, which he was reportedly renting, was so that his girlfriend was unable to move in, according to the local newspaper.

The 48-year-old's pet pitbull was trapped inside the house and was later discovered in the basement.Â 

The man was taken to Tampa General Hospital where he was kept for two weeks after suffering minor burns and smoke inhalation.

He was brought to Hillsborough County Jail earlier this week and charged with first-degree arson and animal cruelty.

Perusse, who runs a gardening business, was held on $55,000 bail. The home was left with more than $70,000 worth of damage.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.
