Findings: The police marksman who shot Azelle Rodney dead in north London in 2005 had 'no lawful justification' for doing so, an official report said

A firearms officer could face trial over the death of a drug dealer in a bungled operation.

Azelle Rodney, 24, was ‘executed’ in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen who suspected he was about to rob Colombian rivals.

The armed officer let off eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point-blank range, claiming he feared the suspect was about to fire a submachine gun.

But a retired High Court judge questioned his account yesterday, ruling there was ‘no lawful justification’ for shooting him dead.

In a highly critical judgment, Sir Christopher Holland castigated almost every aspect of the dangerous operation in April 2005.

He accused the officer, known only as E7, of firing ‘pre-emptive’ shots as police moved in to stop the car carrying three suspected gunmen.

And he said he did not believe E7 held an ‘honest belief’ that Rodney posed a lethal threat.

Sir Christopher also criticised the lack of planning, excessive force in the so-called ‘hard stop’ and the chaotic aftermath.

His inquiry ruling contradicts the findings of independent investigators and marks a turning point in a long-running legal battle.

Rodney’s mother said her son was ‘executed’ and demanded an apology from Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. It also emerged that:

Lawyers for E7, who retired in 2008 to work as a firearms consultant, have already informed Sir Christopher they will seek a judicial review of his ‘irrational’ findings.

He was one of the most respected officers in the Yard’s elite CO19 unit and won seven commendations during a 33-year career.

'No justification': Mr Rodney was shot six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the head

In 1987, he killed two armed robbers 
during a raid at a South London abattoir. In 2008, after bumping into 
him at a social function, former deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers
– who later led the phone-hacking inquiry – told him: ‘I’ve always 
wanted to meet the Met’s very own serial killer.’

E7 complained and was awarded £5,000 for ‘hurt feelings’ over the ill-judged joke.

The Rodney inquiry findings are a 
vindication for campaigners – including the Daily Mail, which fiercely 
opposed the introduction of secret inquests.

Police repeatedly fought for large swathes of evidence to be heard in secret, supposedly to protect intelligence sources.

But experts suspect their real 
motivation was to protect senior officers from humiliation as their 
shortcomings were systematically exposed.

They believe much of the evidence 
revealed during Sir Christopher’s public inquiry would have been covered
up had new legislation been in force.

Rodney was shot dead as he travelled with two other men in a VW Golf through Edgware, North London, on April 30, 2005.

Sir Christopher criticised the Met 
for failing to minimise the danger to Rodney when it planned the 
operation, instead leaving vital decisions to armed officers on the 
ground.

Rodney’s mother, Susan Alexander, said the report backed her view that he was ‘executed’ by the police.

She added: ‘This report has found 
that there was no lawful justification for my son’s killing by the 
police. Azelle’s death was wholly avoidable.

'I shouldn’t be sitting here now, beginning another chapter in my fight for justice for him.

Critical: Azelle Rodney's mother Susan Alexander is seen flanked by Leslie Thomas from Garden Court Chambers (left) and solicitor Daniel Machover (right) as the inquiry's findings were published today 

‘The fact that he was strongly 
suspected in being involved in crime does not justify him or anyone else
being summarily killed.’

Isabella Sankey, of Liberty, which 
campaigns against secret inquests, said: ‘Successive governments used 
this case to try to justify closed hearings, yet the inquiry did its job
without hearing any secret evidence whatsoever.

‘Let’s never forget how secrecy can be used as a cloak for illegality, embarrassment and abuses of power.’

Sir Bernard said: ‘We plan our 
operations to confront the armed and dangerous so as to minimise 
wherever possible the use of lethal force.’

The day officer E7 killed 2 robbers

Before killing Azelle Rodney with six bullets, E7 had shot dead two armed robbers at an abattoir.

The marksman was among a team that hid inside a rental van at a meat depot after receiving a tip-off about an armed raid.

He watched as robbers armed with sawn-off shotguns ran from woods to hijack a Securicor van which contained £120,000.

Emerging from the police van, E7 
killed two robbers with two shots each, fearing they were about to gun 
down the  Securicor driver.

The extraordinary 1987 confrontation 
in Plumstead, South East London, was one of dozens in the officer’s 
tumultuous 33-year career. In 1978 he was commended for bravery after 
taking part in the unarmed arrest of a dangerous gun-carrying villain.

E7 was the first member of the Yard’s
specialist firearms unit, then called D11, to fire an ‘operational 
shot’ when saving a girl of four during a siege in December 1985.

Damning report: Police are seen removing a silver VW Golf believed to be the car Azelle Rodney was travelling in when he was shot in Edgeware in 2005

He twice shot the kidnapper who later
stood trial. The marksman received a commander’s commendation in the 
1990s after an armed stand-off with a gunman in a minicab office.

He said: ‘I could tell that his heart
wasn’t in it and I screamed “armed police” at him and the man dropped 
the gun when I was just about to open fire.’ 

In 2004, the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission recommended that E7 be given ‘words of advice’ 
following an armed operation. 

It was claimed that he left a police 
car without permission during the operation to test his radio and buy 
coffee. E7 said his superiors thought it was ‘a storm in a teacup’.

Another low point followed his arrest during a drunken brawl at a nightclub in Covent Garden, central London, in December 2000.

Admitting it was ‘not one of my 
proudest moments’, he told the inquiry: ‘I ended up with about four or 
five bouncers on top of me and I ended up in a fight. 

‘We all do silly things occasionally 
when we drink but I was old enough and wise enough to know better. It 
was one of those situations that got out of hand.’ 

Shortly before he retired, E7 was 
involved in the bizarre ‘serial killer’ encounter with Met chief Sue 
Akers for which he won £5,000 in compensation and an apology.

By the time he left the frontline in 
2008, E7 had received seven commendations and was training a new 
generation of elite gun cops for Scotland Yard.

He now works as a consultant for a 
firearms and ammunition company. A former senior officer who worked with
E7 on numerous operations, described him as a ‘consummate 
professional’.

He said: ‘Being a firearms officer is
one of the toughest jobs in the police because you’re damned if you do 
and damned if you don’t. Officers have tough choices to make. Sometimes,
armed criminals leave you with little choice. It’s either shoot them or
risk the public being hurt.

‘In the years I’ve known the officer referred to as E7, I’ve always founded him to be very grounded and not gung-ho.

‘He often put himself in the most dangerous positions on an operation because he was one of the best. 

‘He would see things in slow motion and therefore had longer to process what was happening than other officers.’
