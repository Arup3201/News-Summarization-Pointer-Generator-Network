It was more like a welcome given to teen pop idol Justin Bieber than a political leader.

But these North Korean children certainly appeared to be overcome with emotion about meeting Kim Jong Un â€“ even if they may have been instructed to show their happiness.

The youngsters, all members of the Korean Children's Union, wept and jostled to hold the hand of the 'supreme leader' they are raised to refer to as 'father'.

Meeting the Dear Leader: A photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walking surrounded by weeping members of the Korean Children's Union (KCU) during a joint national meeting of KCU organizations at Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang

Revolution is a serious business: Kim sits among
 the young North Koreans, wearing the red scarf that is the emblem 
of the KCU, the first political organisation that North Koreans join 
when they are just seven years old

While the exaggerated display of 
affection is typical of the country, Kim Jong Un is proving to be unlike
 his father with his willingness to mingle with those he rules.

He chose the rally on Wednesday to 
make his second speech at a major public event since taking power in 
December. About 20,000 young people gathered at Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung 
Stadium for the speech, which capped a six-day children's festival.

Wearing the red scarf of the 
Children's Union around his neck, Kim told the young delegates they were
 the future masters of 'a most powerful country where every home will be
 full of laughter and everybody lives in harmony'.

The celebrations took place two days 
after North Korea's military threatened to fire at South Korean media 
companies unless they apologised for criticisms of the festivities, 
including a report comparing them to Hitler Youth rallies.

Special occasion: Kim is led to his seat by 
uniformed members of the KCU. The unprecedented event is the first time a
 festival has been held to celebrate the founding of the youth group 66 
years ago and it was attended by youngsters from across North Korea

June 6 marks the 66th anniversary of 
the founding of the Children's Union, which youngsters join aged seven 
until moving at 13 to the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League.

They are taught to be loyal to the Kim
 dynasty, with education about the accomplishments of the Communist 
republic's founder Kim Il Sung and late leader Kim Jong Il.

Dreams for the future: Kim told his young audience that they were the future masters of 'a most powerful country where every home will be full of laughter and everybody lives in harmony'

Parade: About 20,000 young people gathered at Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Stadium for Wednesday's speech, which South Korean media compared to the rallies held by the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany
