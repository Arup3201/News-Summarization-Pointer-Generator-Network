Most mothers out shopping will be only too familiar with the worry their children will accidentally cause some damage.

Angela Cropley, 27, was no different when her young daughter Lora knocked some items off a shelf in a branch of Boots.

But the 27-year-old was outraged when a female pharmacist then smacked the three-year-old and told her off.

Angela Cropley said her daughter Lora froze in shock when she was smacked by the Boots shop assistant

Boots bosses have apologised after Ms Cropley complained about the incident at the store in Spalding, Lincolnshire

A woman named Michelle smacked the three-year-old and told her she was 'being naughty' for breaking the bottle of Dettol

Miss Cropley was asking the woman, 
aged in her 50s, for advice when Lora began playing with some bath toys 
and knocked over a bottle of disinfectant.

Embarrassed, the mother-of-two quickly
apologised and offered to pay for any damage. But, as she bent down to 
pick up the bottle from the floor, the pharmacist smacked Lora on her 
bottom and said she was a ‘naughty girl’.

When Miss Cropley complained to the store in Spalding, Lincolnshire, the  manager told her: ‘It was only a tap.’

Yesterday she said: ‘Nobody has the 
right to punish my own daughter – just me and her dad, but we would not 
do it like that. If she didn’t have clothes on, she would have had a 
mark, it was enough to shove her forward. I would not even let my 
grandmother do it.

‘If I went in there and “tapped” her, I’d get arrested. She can call it what she likes, she put her hand on my daughter.’

Miss Cropley had gone to the store to 
buy soya milk for her son Toby, eight months, who was with her in a 
pushchair. Only that morning, she had found out he was lactose 
intolerant and so was asking the pharmacist for advice on which brand to
buy.

‘We went over to where they were,’ she
said. ‘We were talking about which one to get and Lora got a bit bored 
and started playing with bath toys on the shelf and knocked a few things
off.

‘There was a Dettol sterilising spray 
and she’d broken one of the lids. I went to pick it up and the lady said
“you naughty girl” and smacked her bottom.

Ms Cropley said she felt 'insulted' by the apology letter from store manager Phillip Belcher who said store worker Michelle smacker her daughter out of 'empathy'

The mother reported the incident to Lincolnshire Police

‘Lora just froze and as we left, she said “that lady smacked my bottom”.’

Miss Cropley returned the next day but Boots refused to apologise until she telephoned the police.

She said: ‘The woman said she had not 
done anything wrong.’ Becoming frustrated at the response, she went to 
police, who said they could not take the matter further.

Miss Cropley finally received a note 
of apology from the manager and pharmacist. She said: ‘It said sorry but
the only explanation was that the staff member’s actions were a gesture
of empathy.

‘I found it a bit insulting. I relied on Boots. I would not trust them now.’

She has not returned to the shop since the incident in February,

‘It completely shocked Lora,’ added 
Miss Cropley. ‘Even now she asks “why did that lady smack my bottom?” 
She has a really good memory.’

Yesterday Siobhan Freegard, founder of
leading parenting website Netmums.com, said: ‘This is shocking. Shop 
staff wouldn’t slap an adult who knocked over a display, so why hit a 
child?

‘Children can be clumsy. As a family 
friendly store, parents would expect Boots to recognise that accidents  
happen. For a stranger to hit their child feels like a real violation.’

Noel Arnold, director of legal 
practice at the charity Coram Children’s Legal Centre, said: ‘Smacking 
someone else’s child in a shop is unlawful and is likely to be 
considered an assault.’

A Boots spokesman said the store  
carried out a thorough investigation and added: ‘We would like to 
apologise for any distress caused.’
