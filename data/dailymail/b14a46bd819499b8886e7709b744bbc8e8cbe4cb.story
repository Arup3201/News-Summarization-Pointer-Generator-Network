Accident: Lucy Sallis died in L'Alpe d'Huez after climbing over a six foot fence to get to an outdoor pool. She was a trainee chef at the resort

A British teenager drowned in a swimming pool yesterday after a night out with friends in the French ski resort where she worked.

Lucy Sallis, 19, and a male friend she had been drinking with climbed over a 6ft fence to get to the outdoor pool in Alpe d’Huez.

Police say the trainee chef, who was working at the Hotel Belle Aurore, stripped off before diving or jumping into the pool in the early hours.

It is believed she became trapped under a tarpaulin that was partly covering the municipal pool.

When her friend realised Lucy, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, had not resurfaced he frantically tried to pull the tarpaulin away and found her unconscious. A rescue team tried to revive Lucy but she died at the scene. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today.

A local police spokesman said: ‘It was late at night and the young girl and a boyfriend decided they wanted to take a swim. The pool was closed so they climbed the wall. There are two swimming pools, both of which are covered at night. The girl jumped into the smaller pool.

‘The boy went looking around. Then when he went to the pool he found the girl’s lifeless body.’

French police spoke through interpreters to the friend and others who had been with them earlier. A local police source said: ‘The group had been drinking, but probably not to excess.

‘The incident is being investigated. An accident is the main line of inquiry.’

Lucy’s mother Karen was too upset to speak at her home last night. Lucy, who was educated at Chichester College, and her friend worked for the British-based company SkiBound, and are thought to have been based in separate hotels.

A keen snowboarder, she is believed to have been in the resort since November.

Scene of tragedy: The 19-year-old drowned after jumping into this outdoor swimming pool at the Alpe d'Huez resort in France during a drinking session with friends

Covering: The apprentice chef stripped off and dived into the water despite the fact that it was covered by a protective sheet, although only partially

She had worked in a kitchen in the UK and had met leading chef Marco Pierre White.

The traditional Alpine-style hotel where she worked is predominantly used for school trips. One bar server said: ‘It’s such a terrible thing to happen. She’s a lovely girl with a great spirit.’

Fabrice Hurth, director of the tourist office, said: ‘We don’t know all the details but we believe she climbed over the fence and jumped in the pool.

‘It probably was just a silly, bad joke that young people do. But it ended so tragically.

‘The pool has been closed today and it will remain closed until the police say it can be reopened.’

SkiBound said: ‘The thoughts and condolences of all at SkiBound are with the family and friends.

‘All our efforts are focused on ensuring they are supported in any way possible through this very difficult time.’

Alpe d’Huez, 300 miles south-east of Paris, is one of the oldest ski resorts in France and one of its most popular, with more than 155 miles of pistes.

The resort, known as ‘L’Ile au Soleil’ – the Island of the Sun – because most of its slopes face south, attracts thousands of British skiers each year as well as students working during their gap year. Its foreign workers – seasonaires – are overwhelmingly British and just out school.

Alpe d’Huez is at the top of one of the main mountain stages in the Tour de France.

It is popular with all abilities of skier, from schools and families on its gentle nursery slopes and green runs to expert skiers on its 16 black runs, which include the lung-bursting La Sarenne, at 10 miles Europe’s longest black run.

Investigation: Police said they believed the group had been drinking but are treating the incident as an accident

Location: The resort of Alpe-d'Huez, around 300 miles from Paris, is hugely popular with British holidaymakers
