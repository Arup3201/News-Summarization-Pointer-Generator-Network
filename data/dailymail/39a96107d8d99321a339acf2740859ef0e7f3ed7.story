Three people have been killed after a suspected Al Shabaab suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a UN convoy near Mogadishu's airport this morning.

The attack also wounded seven people, a police spokesman said, although he did not say whether the dead and wounded were part of the UN convoy or were passers-by. 

The militant group Al Shabaab frequently carries out suicide blasts and gun attacks in the Somali capital. The group has also claimed two deadly attacks against Kenyan civilians near the Kenya-Somali border over the last two weeks.

The suspected Al Shabaab-linked suicide bomber rammed his car into a UN convoy near Mogadishu's airport

Yusuf Haji, a resident in the area where this morning's suicide car bombing took place, said soldiers fired at pedestrians after the blast.

Mogadishu Airport has a tight security cordon and blast-proof walls, and is used as a base for U.N. operations in Somalia. The airport area is also the home to the British and Italian embassies.

Al Shabaab has promised to step up attacks after African Union and Somali troops launched an offensive this year that has driven the group from major strongholds, including its last major coastal base of Barawe in October. 

Yesterday Al-Shabaab rebels murdered at least 36 Kenyan quarry workers near the country's northern border with Somalia.

The gunmen crossed over the border into Kenya's Mandera County and divided the Muslim and non-Muslim workers into two groups before opening fire.

Kenyan police chief David Kimaiyo was later removed from his post, along with the Kenyan interior minister.

Police sources said the workers were ambushed as they slept in the camp at the Korome quarry. The non-Muslim workers were singled-out and killed. 

Eyewitnesses claimed that 32 of the victims had been shot while the final four had been decapitated.  

Mandera county governor Ali Roba said: 'It is sad that we have another 36 people who were attacked and killed late last night in the same manner it happened on a bus recently. It happened at a quarry about 10 miles from Mandera town.'

Some 28 people were killed in the area last month when al
Shabaab militants hijacked a Nairobi-bound bus, causing
widespread anger. Kenya has suffered a string of gun and grenade
attacks since it sent troops into Somalia to fight al Shabaab in
late 2011.
