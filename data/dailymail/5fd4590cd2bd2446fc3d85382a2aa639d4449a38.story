Ukip was last night forced to apologise after branding Labour rising star Chuka Umunna a ‘racist’ – based on words he never used.

The Shadow Business Secretary was shocked after Ukip Euro MP Jane Collins last week went on Twitter to accuse him of racism.

She posted an image of Mr Umunna allegedly saying black people should be preferred to white people for top jobs to ‘spice things up a bit’, calling it an ‘extraordinary racist comment’.

Extraordinary indeed: Ukip MEP Jane Collins circulated this quote - which Labour's Chuka Umunna never said

Ukip parliamentary candidate David Sprason also tweeted the picture and accused Mr Umunna of promoting a ‘racist agenda’.

But the two politicians were forced to apologise after Mr Umunna insisted the quotation was fiction, made up by a far-Right website.

Labour MP Steve Rotheram said: ‘This just shows once again the true face of Ukip – a party that is happy to regurgitate lies originating on a far-Right website.’

Last night, Mrs Collins said: ‘When I realised this quote about Chuka Umunna was untrue, I immediately sent a tweet to apologise. It was a lapse of judgment on my part.’

Mr Sprason said: ‘If Chuka didn’t say these words, I will apologise and withdraw my comments.’
