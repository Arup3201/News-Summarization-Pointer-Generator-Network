A builder dumped twice by an African bride who used him to get a UK visa has denied being Britain’s most gullible groom as he prepared to marry a second Kenyan beauty.

Tim Reeves, 58, was dumped by Priscila Njenga the day after she got her hands on a spouse’s visa following their wedding.

Amazingly, when she turned up at his door begging for help getting her daughter into Britain - heartbroken Tim took her back.

But the day after he secured her daughter’s visa Njenga left him for the second time and has never returned.

Déjà vu: Tim Reeves, 58, with his ex-wife Priscila Njoki Njenga on their wedding day in Kenya in October 2008, right, and, left, with new fiancee Maryanne Wanja, 26, who he met on an African dating website

The cheated brickie later learned she was already married and had lied about her age - telling him she was 34 when she was 40.

Mr Reeves, from  Slough, Berkshire, now suspects the whole wedding was a scam and that many of the guests were actors brought in to dupe him.

But despite his experience, Mr Reeves is now engaged to Kenyan Maryanne Wanja, 26, who he has known for four months after they met on an African dating website.

He is so besotted he has already moved his lover out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in Kenya.

Happy: Mr Reeves is so besotted with Miss Wanja he has already moved her out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in Kenya

Mr Reeves is also paying for all of her food and clothes and school fees for her daughter’s private education.

His worried family believe he is falling for exactly the same trick again and are panicking about him switching continents to be with her.

But the love-blind Romeo denied being gullible and declared: 'This time it’s love.'

He said: 'I can’t wait to marry Maryanne. We spend hours a day talking and miss each other so much. She’s the woman of my dreams and is perfect for me.

'I know people might think I’m being taken for a ride, especially after my last experience, but Maryanne is completely different to Priscila and I know this is the real deal.'

He added: 'When Priscila left me I felt completely betrayed. She lied about everything - even telling me she was 34 when she was actually 40.

Awkward: When first wife Priscila Njenga, left, walked out on Mr Reeves the builder found out she was already married and had lied about her age, telling him she was 34 when she was 40

'I was stupid to take her back, but I felt sorry for her daughter. It is very hard to refuse to help when you are hearing horrific stories about what is happening to a young girl.

'I can see now that she only wanted her daughter in the UK so the authorities could not throw her out if Helen was in full-time education. She planned everything.

'The difference is I spent every day with Maryanne for seven weeks and I know her much better. I have met her friends - I only met one of Priscila’s friends.

'Maryanne is not a risk as she has no desire to move to the UK. She just wants me to stay in Kenya with her.

'I’ve fallen out with my mum and my close friends about emigrating - it’s hard as they don’t want me to get hurt again.

Second time lucky? Mr Reeves then fell foul of Njenga again when she begged him to take her back so her daughter Helen could get a visa. He did and then she left

'But this is my future happiness.'

Mr Reeves met Njenga in 2008 after his Kenyan friend Moses Mbarue showed him a picture of her and revealed she wanted an English man.

After a brief phone chat Mr Reeves flew out to see Njenga and felt a 'connection' - even though she didn’t speak English.

He proposed to her on a restaurant balcony on his fourth day in Kenya on May 16, 2008.

He shelled out £5,000 on the ceremony in Kenya on October 25, 2008 and bought Njenga a six-month visiting visa so they could fly back to England in November.

The couple then went back to Kenya on April 13, 2009, after Mr Reeves had raised the money for a spouse's visa.

I've done it: Njenga, pictured with  her daughter Helen, makes a quick call possibly to Mr Reeves's friend Moses Mbarue who the builder believes she was already married to

Sham: Njenga put that she was a 'business woman' on the couple's marriage certificate

He came back to the UK on May 13, and Njenga arrived back on May 30, but by August 6 she had disappeared.

But forgiving Mr Reeves rekindled their romance when Njenga turned up at his house in May 2010 begging him to help bring her 18-year-old daughter, Helen, over to the UK.

But after Mr Reeves helped Helen gain temporary access to the UK, in August, Njenga and her daughter disappeared and have not been seen since.

Still in search of true love Mr Reeves met his new African fiancee Maryanne on dating website Afro Introductions and flew out to spend seven weeks with her in December 2011.

Devoted Mr Reeves moved Maryanne out of a shack in a dangerous slum and she now lives in his flat at a cost of £140 a month.

He also says he pays £25 a week for food and bills as well as the school fees for Maryanne’s daughter.

Sure thing: Mr Reeves said he has fallen out with his family over his upcoming nuptials to Miss Wanja and his intention to immigrate to Kenya to be with her

He proposed on Christmas Day and he is moving to Kenya to live with her and set up a charity and a security business.

Mr Reeves said: 'Maryanne and I have lead completely different lives, but we have a deep understanding of each other.

'We talk about everything that has happened to me and her life as an orphan - our hardships bring us together.

'She loves me so much and we message each other at least 20 times a day on Facebook. Sometimes I wish I had never got involved in all this, but then I would not have met Maryanne.

'I am finally living a real-life love story.'

Mr Reeves now believes Njenga was already married to his best friend and house mate Moses Mbarue - who introduced them.

He claimed she was living with a 70-year-old man in Bournemouth, Dorset, when they split and is now living illegally in the UK as her visa ran out on August 13, 2010.

He has now been told by Kenyan and UK authorities that the documents used by Njenga for their marriage were fake so it is void and he is free to marry his fiancee.

A spokesman from the UK Border Agency said they were aware of the case.

He said: 'UKBA will investigate all allegations of immigration crime and will take action when it is considered necessary.”

Pricila Njenga said: "I refute the allegation that I only married Tim Reeves to gain the right to live in Britain. This was not the true basis of our relationship, which I considered entirely genuine in every respect."Because our relationship broke down I chose to leave him."We were reconciled in the hope of making our marriage work."Unfortunately, his behaviour - in my opinion - meant I was unable to stay living with him and the relationship broke down again."I refute any allegations of wrong-doing and wish to state my legal right to live and work in Britain and raise my daughter peacefully."

Moses Mbarue and Maryanne Wanja were all unavailable for comment.
