Soft drinks giant Red Bull has accused a little-known UK microbrewery of infringing its trademark and has demanded it change its name.

The energy drinks firm has sent Norwich-based Redwell Brewing - which only started trading in October and employs just eight staff - a threatening letter insisting it could not use the word 'red' because it owned the trademark.

The Austrian company also objected to the second part of the name 'well' because it ends with the same two letters as 'bull'.

The stage has been set for a classic David Vs Goliath battle as Redwell looks to defend its name against a firm that employs 9,000 people, turned over â‚¬4.25 billion last year, and whose products are sold in 161 different countries.

Finance director Benjamin Thompson 
said: 'It's quite worrying. The reason for their response to our 
trademark is ridiculous really.

'Their
stance is completely unfair and unreasonable. It's quite concerning 
when you've got a massive company trying to get you to do something you 
shouldn't have to do.

'Our brands are completely different and we're not trying to infringe their brand in any way.'

Newcomer: The brewery only started trading in October

The trouble flared up about two months ago when Redwell applied to trademark its name.

Red Bull was alerted to the matter and brand 
enforcement manager Hansjorg Jeserznik wrote to the owners of the small 
brewery in Bracondale near County Hall ordering them to withdraw the 
application.

In the letter, Mr Jeserznik, accused Redwell's application 
of compromising Red Bull's earlier trademark 'red' which would confuse the public.

His letter read: 'Furthermore the term "bull" and the term "well" share the same ending and just differ in two letters.

'The ending "ll" is identical and 
therefore the terms Red Bull and Redwell are confusingly similar from a 
visual as well from a phonetical point of view.'

He added: 'Consumers ... will 
easily consider the sign "Redwell" as a line extension under "Red Bull",
in particular that the goods and services offered under "Redwell" and 
"Red Bull" are coming from the same undertaking.

'The consumer will thus be confused as to the origin of the services.'

Threatening legal action unless Redwell obeyed its demand, Mr Jeserznik argued that the trademark would 'take unfair advantage of, dilute and 
tarnish the Red Bull trademarks'.

Redwell Brewing was founded by directors Patrick Fisher, Benjamin Thompson, Michael Baxter and Amy Hancock.

And they have vowed to fight the global firm, saying they have already ratcheted up 'thousands of pounds' in legal fees.

Mr Thompson said: 'We called ourselves Redwell after Redwell Street in Norwich. It was not just some random name we picked out of thin air.

Cheers: Mr Thompson and Ms Hancock raise a glass despite legal worries brought on by global giant Red Bull

'Patrick and Amy are part-owners of the Norwich Tap House in Redwell Street, and our beers are sold there.

'The name of Red Bull never came up 
at all when we were discussing what to call the brewery. I cannot see 
that there would be any confusion between Red Bull and Redwell.

'For a start, Red Bull is two words and Redwell is one, and then the second words are different. We are different names, brands, designs and products.'

Mr Thompson explained after some 
initial legal wrangling, Red Bull agreed to let them keep using the 
name Redwell on its existing products, but demanded any new lines it 
introduces and branding such as T-shirts be given a different name.

What's in a name: The firm are refusing to rebrand and say they have already clocked up thousands of pounds in legal fees

He added: 'A lot of hard work has gone into developing our brand. The design on our bottles and other merchandise was created by third year graphic designers at Norwich University of the Arts.

'It would be catastrophic for us now to have to go back to the drawing board to find another name.'

Mr Fisher said: 'It seems like an over-the-top reaction. As a small, innovative brewery, it's quite worrying to have this thing hanging over our heads, when we are looking to move the business forward.

Redwell supplies craft beer to pubs 
in Norwich and London and is expanding to sell across the country to 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester.

It produces 3,000 litres of beer every week, has been selling beer for about five months, and employs eight people.

Confusion: Redwell say Red Bull never even crossed their minds when they were devising their name, and their name was taken from the street where they also run a pub

It claims to be the first brewery to brew its own lager in Norwich for more than 30 years.

Founded in 1984, Red Bull employed 8,966 people in 165 countries by the end of last year as its top product rules and dominates the global energy drinks industry.

Mr Thompson said they had now replied to Red Bull's request and were trying hard to find a reasonable solution without giving up their name.

A Red Bull spokesman said the company did not comment on pending cases.
