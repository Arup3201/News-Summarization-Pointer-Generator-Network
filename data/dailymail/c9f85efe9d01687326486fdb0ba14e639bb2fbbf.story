These photographs of extreme weather capture storms furiously rolling across the sky above America.

While most people would run a mile when confronted with a giant storm, photographer Dennis Oswald has been doing the opposite for the past 17 years.

The 34-year-old storm chaser, inspired by his passion for travelling and severe weather, travels from his home in Neuss, Germany to the United States, where he can photograph storms on an apocalyptic scale.

Dennis says: 'In the late 90s I was already interested in photographing landscapes and I also had a passion for travelling and severe weather.

'I recognised that there were some people in the USA who were called storm chasers.

'I read a lot about them and thought their stories and pictures were awesome, which is when I realised I could do this too.

Dennis has been capturing spectacular sights like this powerful storm captured in Decatur, Texas for the last 17 years

'Storms can be very dangerous, but I want to provide another view and show how they can be powerful and peaceful at the same time.

'I want to show that these phenomenon are like landscapes, just not on the ground and instead, in the sky.

'To me, they are beautiful.'

When photographing the natural phenomenon, Dennis positions himself between one to three miles away from the storm, in locations such as Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma.

As well as travelling to America, Dennis has also photographed storms in his home town of Neuss, Germany.

Dennis says: 'During a storm, how I feel all depends on the type of storm I'm photographing.

'If the storm moves slowly and I have some distance between me and it, I feel the calmness, peace and a sense of freedom which surrounds me on these endless highways.

'If the storm is really fast and dangerous, I have to deal with less time to take pictures and I often have to move to another position and look after my safety.

While acknowledging storms are 'very dangerous,' Dennis hopes his photographs show the beauty and power of the unique scenes

'It can be stressful but exciting at the same time.

'I personally chase storms because of my passion for travelling, photography and Mother Nature, and I do everything to be as safe as I can be and stay outside of the storms.

'My fiancee, Vera Schmitz, 28, loves my pictures and she would like to chase storms in the US with me one day.

'The rest of my family however think a little differently, they do love my pictures and stories but are happy when I'm back home safe and sound.'

Was inspired after reading about fellow storm chasers in the US, so decided to get a piece of the action
