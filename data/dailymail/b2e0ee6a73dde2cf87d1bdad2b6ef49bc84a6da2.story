Art: Andy Warhol's 'Mao' in typical pop-art fashion is estimated to fetch £22,000 at the auction tonight

An obsessive collector is in for a red letter day when he sells his one £1m hoard of artefacts connected to Chinese dictator Chairman Mao Tse-Tung.

The unidentified fan has an interest in the late communist leader for several years and began a relentless quest to snap up as many Red Army propaganda items as possible.

Over a 15 year period he made repeated trips to China to amass his collection that ranges from the bizarre to the spectacular.

The hoarder has now decided to put the artefacts up for sale in London.

The auction spans 280 lots and comprises of almost every item imaginable that was produced to glorify the dictator who ruled China with an iron grip between 1945 to 1976.

There are photos of the megalomaniac, statuettes, banners, paintings, drawings, ornaments, currency, books, medals, badges, tableware, posters, fans and clocks.

One 1970 painting alone by the Chinese artist He Kongde, that depicts Mao giving a conference speech to the Chinese Communist Party in 1929, is valued at £70,000.

There is a print of Mao in later years by the American artist Andy Warhol in typical pop-art fashion worth £22,000.

One of the most eye-catching lots is an oil painting of Mao wearing a bathrobe and in his waving pose after his famous 1966 swim across the Yangtze River.

But, in an ironic touch, Iclandic 
artist Erro placed him cruising down the Hudson River with the New York 
skyline in the background. The painting is worth £60,000.

The
most valuable item at the auction is an incredibly rare 100 Yuan bank 
note that was twice signed by Mao in 1941. It has a pre-sale estimate of
£150,000.

Striking: One of the most eye-catching lots is an 
oil painting of Mao wearing a bathrobe cruising down the Hudson River with the New York 
skyline in the background. It's expected to fetch £60,000

Valuable: A porcelain Mao bust in a wooden shrine is worth £3,500 and Dali's 'Poems to Mao Tse Tung, right

Other lots 
include a set of three, 4.5 ins tall bronze statuettes of Mao dressed in
his trademark Red Army uniform, worth £20,000.

There are woven silk portraits of the
‘Five Greats’ of communist philosophy - Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, 
Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao.

Many propaganda items sold to the Chinese population show the People’s Liberation Army conquering over their Western enemies.

There
is a porcelain figure of a soldier jumping on an American pilot that is
valued at £1,200 and a sinister rubber toy of a Red Army guard sat 
astride an American military policeman, beating him with a clenched 
fist.

Sale: An impression of Mao by Gerhard Richter could fetch £10,000 and right, 'The Japanese Army Completely Surrenders' is worth £16,000 and is among the impressive 'groundbreaking' collection

The sale is being held by Bloomsbury auctions.

Rupert Powell, deputy chairman of 
Bloomsbury, said: 'It is a ground-breaking sale. Nothing like this has 
ever been sold before in one hit.

'The diversity and the range in value of the items for sale is quite extraordinary.

'The
thing about a lot of this material is that it was mass produced 
propaganda; every household in China would have had a picture of Mao and
things like banners and figuerines.

'Having said that, it is quite rare for some of these items, such as posters, to survive until today.

'These lots are from the time they were produced - between the 1930s up until Mao’s death in 1976.'

Wealth: The
most valuable item at the auction is this incredibly rare 100 Yuan bank 
note that was twice signed by Mao in 1941. It has a pre-sale estimate of
£150,000

The unnamed vendor, who is aged in his 50s and is from the US, has spent the last 15 years building his Chairman Mao collection.

Mr
Powell said: 'I think he just got captivated by this culture and 
decided to buy a few things at first and it just grew from there.

'Like so many collectors, it grew into a bit of an obsession.

'But
it has got a bit overwhelming for him and buying these things in China 
is becoming more difficult as the market establishes itself.

Mao Zedong, selected works for PLA is worth £300 and a soldier jumping on an American Pilot is worth £1200

'With collecting, the thrill of the chase it what drives you on and if you aren’t buying anymore than it is time to sell.

'We
are expecting interest from world wide collectors, from London, the US 
and China, although it is likely many bidders will be Chinese.'

Chairman Mao was the founder father of the People’s Republic of China and governed the country under the communist party.

His ‘Great Leap Foward’ campaign in 1958 that saw the diversion of labour from agriculture to the steel industry led to a catastrophic famine that killed 40 million men, women and children.

Millions more people were killed several years later under his cultural revolution which persecuted capitalists.

The auction takes place on October 4.
