Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is planning to mount a challenge for one of California's two U.S. Senate seats, most likely the one held by Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, MailOnline can reveal today.

Sandberg is among the wealthiest women in America – her reported net worth is $1.05 billion – making the $30 or $40 million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone.

'Sheryl 
wants to find a seat before the election in 2016, when Hillary Clinton 
will likely run for president,' a source close to Sandberg's inner circle told MailOnline.

When MailOnline contacted Sandberg yesterday there was no comment. However, this morning a source close to her said that 'it is 100 per cent untrue.'

Bruising: A run at Barbara Boxer's seat would spell problems for Hillary Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. It would force her to choose sides between the two women she has been close to. However, a source close to Sandberg today told MailOnline the claims are '100 per cent untrue'

2016 is the year Sen. Boxer will stand
 for re-election. Dianne Feinstein, the state's other senator, won't 
face another contest until 2018, but she could retire by then – leaving 
an open seat.

Sandberg, MailOnline's source said, isn't likely to wait that long.

A bruising fight between two ambitious women would force Hillary Clinton to choose sides, between her former colleague in the U.S. Senate and the woman who managed the day-to-day operation of the Treasury Department during Bill Clinton's second term in the White House.

Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Larry Summers from 1996 until the Clintons left Washington. The 44-year-old married mother of two helped lead Treasury’s work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.

As her footprint grew, so did her influence. Forbes lists her as the world's sixth-most powerful woman, right behind Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton.

U.S.House Minority Leader and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ranks #22. Barbara Boxer didn't make the list at all.

Sandberg, the Miami-born executive whose book 'Lean In' is a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace, has already faced questions about whether a run for political office is her inevitable next step.

When asked about her plans at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January, she appeared to rule out a move from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill.

Asked, 'Is politics for you?' she replied: 'Not for me. I just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics.'

Rival: Barbara Boxer's seat in California is up for re-election in 2016. Sandberg made it as sixth on the Forbes list of most powerful women. Boxer didn't make it

But the source waved off Sandberg's dismissal: 'Don't believe it. Sheryl has everything planned. She's the kind of woman who doesn't look five years ahead, she looks 15.'

'She sees politics as her future, definitely. This is what she has mapped out. She has spent her life courting the most powerful people in the country and she's an incredibly smart and focused woman – she knows what she wants.'

California is a decidedly blue state, making Democrats' control of U.S. Senate seats a near shoo-in.

Boxer, 73, won her last three elections by 10, 20 and 10 percentage points, including her easy 2010 victory over Republican Carly Fiorina, the former CEO and chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard.

That election cost $28 million for Boxer to win, in a year where there was no simultaneous presidential contest driving up the price of running TV and radio ads.

But she is used to deploying most of her campaign cash in the general election, not in a hotly contested primary that could weaken her and leave her cash-poor just in time for Republicans to start attacking.

The net effect of a Sandberg-Boxer slugfest could be an easier playing field for a Republican Senate hopeful, a Missouri GOP consultant told MailOnline.

'That's always what we look for,' said the campaign operative, who asked not to be named. 'When two evenly matched liberals punch each other silly, and money is no object for at least one of them, it's the best scenario possible for us come November – as long as we can all get behind a single candidate ourselves.'

California now has a so-called 'blanket' primary, in which all the candidates – regardless of party – jockey for position in the hope of emerging as one of the top two vote-getters. Those two then slug it out in a November runoff.

Inspiration: Sandberg has written 'Lean In', a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace so a dramatic move into politics would not come as a huge surprise

A move from the executive suite to government's elite would fit with the central message of Sandberg's book, that women need to push themselves in order to get ahead and realize their full potential.

That platform, already a blueprint for rallying career women, will require government to 'lean in' as well, she says, in order to create an environment that will allow working mothers to create their own solutions to workplace inequalities.

'There's a chicken-and-egg going on,' she said during a Davos session on gender-driven growth.

'We need better public and corporate policies. We need more women in leadership roles to get those policies.'

Sandberg may have decided that she has to roll up her sleeves and start tinkering with federal law herself.

'Sheryl is going to make a statement about her future soon,' another source told MailOnline.

Sandberg's wealth and her coterie of powerful friends would give her instant credibility if she were to put Boxer on notice more than two years before the 2016 elections. And her base of operations in tony San Mateo County near Stanford University would serve her well in a statewide campaign.

In August she and her family moved into their new compound in Menlo Park, just minutes from Facebook's headquarters.

Their sprawling 9,210-square-foot home features a gym, movie theater and even a basketball court for her young children.

Currently Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand woman, Sandberg was lured to the social network site in 2008 from Google, where she had been vice president of global online sales & operations since 2001.

In 2012, the Harvard-educated businesswoman became the eighth member – and the first female member – of Facebook's board of directors.

In August she sold 2.4 million Facebook shares worth $91 million, just five per cent of her total stake in the company.

David Goldberg, the CEO of SurveyMonkey, is Sandberg's second husband. They maintain a low-key personal life, something that would change instantly if she were to dive headlong into American politics.

Boxer is used to bruising elections but is accustomed to spending her war chest against GOP challengers, not aiming ads at fellow Democrats

It would mean Clinton would have to choose sides between the two women
