Benedict Cumberbatch is set to marry his pregnant fiancée Sophie Hunter in a romantic ceremony today - and is believed to have asked his Sherlock co-star Martin Freeman to be his best man.

The intimate wedding will take place in front of close friends and family in the sprawling grounds of a spectacular period property on the Isle of Wight.

It is understood other guests will include actress Keira Knightley, who starred alongside Cumberbatch in the Imitation Game - the film which has earned the actor his first Oscar nomination.

If Freeman does step in as Cumberbatch's best man, it will be an echo of Sherlock - where Cumberbatch's Holmes stood up for Freeman's Watson in the TV wedding.

News of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper on November 5 and four weeks after confirming they are expecting their first child. 

It was previously reported that Sherlock star Benedict, 38, planned to marry theatre director Sophie before she gave birth.

Speaking in January, a source told The Sunday Mirror: 'The invitations have gone out already, which is very quick. 

'It's shocked a few people but they want their special day to happen before they have the baby.

'The details have been sent out in an email rather than a paper invitation as time is of the essence.

Spotted: The pair were first seen watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June

The invitations are believed to be limited to family and close friends, all of whom have been sworn to secrecy about the location of the ceremony.

The source added: 'They're planning the perfect day. Life couldn't be much better for them at the moment.'

Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years but dated for just five months prior to their engagement.

The pair were first spotted watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June.

Since then, they have been seen having dinner together in London — entering and leaving the restaurant separately.

They also attended the wedding of one of Benedict’s school friends last September.

The actor and his fiancée are looking forward to becoming parents for the first time, but say they do not yet know the sex of the baby.

A spokesperson for Benedict told MailOnline at the time: 'I am delighted to confirm that Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter are expecting their first child. They are both over the moon.' 

Previously: Benedict’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year

The New York Post's Page Six were the first to report that the Imitation Game star was 'delighted and excited about becoming a dad'.

A source told the site: 'Sophie is a few months along, and both she and Benedict are very excited about it. They are also quietly planning to marry in early spring.' 

Benedict’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year. 

Though he has been linked to a number of women over the years, people who know Benedict insist he has not dated even half of them. 

One said: ‘He’s not a “player”, although he does go to lots of parties and talks to lots of girls.’
