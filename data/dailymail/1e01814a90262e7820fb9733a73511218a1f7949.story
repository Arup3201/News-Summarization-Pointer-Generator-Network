Investigators did not have enough evidence until last month to take custody of a 7-year-old Wyoming boy who was allegedly kept in an outdoor cage, despite requests last year to check on his welfare, authorities said.

Albany County Sheriff Dave O'Malley expressed frustration Wednesday that deputies couldn't act sooner, but the initial investigations didn't provide enough evidence, the Laramie Daily Boomerang reported.

The boy was kept in a cage outside, and forced to use the bucket for a restroom instead of the one in the house.

Jena Harman and Alexander Smith are each charged with one count of child abuse and
 three counts of felonious restraint in the alleged mistreatment of Harman's son, 7

'It's not easy to take custody of a 
child away from their parent,' O'Malley said. 'When you get to the

Harman's hearing has yet to be scheduled

point
 that you've got the evidence so that you can do that and feel 
comfortable that the child is going to be in a safe environment for a 
period of time, that's when you act, and that's what we did.'

Fox News reports mother Jena Harman and boyfriend Alexander Smith were each charged with one count of child abuse and three counts of felonious restraint in the case.

Sheriff's deputies took the boy into protective custody July 24 after finding the 6-by-6-foot cage made of wood and metal outside a rural house west of Laramie. O'Malley said he was told the boy is doing well now.

The boy's mother and her boyfriend were arrested on child-abuse charges.

The man was scheduled to appear in court Thursday. The woman's next hearing has not been scheduled.

The Associated Press typically does not identify abuse victims and is withholding the suspects' names to avoid identifying the child.

A court document said the sheriff's 
department received a child abuse report about the boy in August and 
seven requests to check on his welfare starting in October.

'Up
 until July 24 of this year, none of those investigations were sustained
 at a level that (was) appropriate for us to take any type of action,' 
O'Malley said.

Inside this cage where the boy was kept even in storms, deputies discovered a cot, clothing, books, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a five-gallon bucket

Deputies said the child reported 
living in the 5-foot-high enclosure off and on for three weeks.

He said 
meals were brought to the cage and that he slept there overnight even 
when it rained.

Inside the 
cage, deputies discovered a cot, clothing, books, a toothbrush, 
toothpaste and a five-gallon bucket, according to court documents.

A metal chain and 'dog-leash-style latch' allegedly were used to keep the child locked in the enclosure.
