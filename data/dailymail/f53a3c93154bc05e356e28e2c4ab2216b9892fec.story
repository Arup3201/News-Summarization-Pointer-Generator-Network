An Indian woman who exposed her husband as a terrorist has been permanently disfigured after his family stormed into her home and threw acid at her in a revenge attack.

Reshma Rangrez, 32, from Ahmedabad, western India,  blew the whistle on spouse Shehzad in 2011 after she caught him making crude bombs, apparently destined for a terror attack.

When officers raided the couple's home, they found seven jars containing an unidentified liquid used in the manufacturing of explosives, some stowed in a pile of rubbish nearby.

Heroine: Reshma Rangrez, 32, blew the whistle on spouse Shehzad in 2011 after she caught him making crude bombs, apparently destined for a terror attack

Shehzad was jailed and Mrs Rangrez became a household name for her bravery in shedding light on the apparent plot and was given a Rs 25,000 (£300) reward.

She was even offered a job in the city traffic brigade by the city's police commissioner.

But then last month, Shehzad's parents forced their way into Mrs Rangrez's home and thrust a jar of acid in her face, following a string of threats against her life.

Rewarded: Mrs Rangrez became a household name in her hometown of Mumbai for her bravery in shedding light on the apparent plot and was given a Rs 25,000 reward in a ceremony in 2011

Brave: She was even offered a job in the city traffic brigade by the city's police commissioner and offered permanent home security which she refused

Honoured: Luckily the corrosive liquid missed her face, instead splashing onto her arm, leaving her with serious burns, the Times of India reported

'My in-laws burst into the house at 3.30am with a bottle,' she said. 'Before I could understand what was happening, they threw acid at me. My shrieks of pain alerted my neighbours who rushed to my help.'

Luckily the corrosive liquid missed her face, instead splashing onto her arm, leaving her with serious burns, the Times of India reported.

Police have arrested her father-in-law Ismail Rangrez and mother-in-law Hanifa who await trial fro the attack.

Shehzad was caught with a crude bomb and a country-made pistol when police officials had raided the house in July 2011. He later led detectives to seven other bombs he had made and hidden in a rubbish pile at Chandola lake, in Ahmedabad, 500 kilometres north of Mumbai.
