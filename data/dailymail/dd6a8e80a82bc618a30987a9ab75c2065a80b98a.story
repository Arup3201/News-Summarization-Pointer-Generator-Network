Platinum-selling rapper Young Jeezy has been arrested on suspicion of possessing illegal firearms--specifically an assault rifle--during an investigation into a fatal shooting at the concert in Silicon Valley 

The Atlanta-based rapper, whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins, was taken into custody Sunday by detectives along with five other people while executing a search warrant at the Verizon Amphitheater in Irvine, Mountain View police spokesman Sgt. Saul Jaeger said Monday.

They were taken to the Orange County jail, where Jenkins was being held on $1 million bail.

The arrests come after Eric Johnson of Orinda was shot and killed while backstage at the Under the Influence of Music concert Jeezy co-headlined with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View on Friday.

The 38-year-old husband and father worked as a concert promoter for Bay Area musicians, but was not connected to the concert tour where he lost his life.

The five other people arrested were Alexa Beason, 52; William Paul Gilmore, 48; David Kuniansky-Altman, 31; Kena Jermaine Marshall, 39; and Peter Arthur Maynard, 38 according to the Mercury News. 

All five were somehow employed on the tour.

None of the arrested has been identified as suspects in the fatal shooting, Jaeger said.

'We haven't made any arrests for the homicide. These arrests were made during the execution of the warrant,' Jaeger said.

 Police, however, say they are still in search of a suspect described as between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-8. 

Victim: 38-year-old husband and father Eric Johnson was shot and killed at the Wiz Khalifa/Young Jeezy concert on Saturday in Mountain View, California

Not implicated: Wiz Khalifa has in no way been implicated in the crime that took place backstage at his concert Saturday

Police believe the African American man in his 20s used a black pistol with a large magazine.

A source told TMZ that the victim was shot backstage and was hit at least five times.

Wiz, real name Cameron Jibril Thomaz, posted two tweets on Saturday afternoon, calling the killing a 'senseless tragedy' and added: 'Violence is never the answer. My prayers go out to the victim’s family. 

Police are asking anyone with information, video or photos about the shooting to call 650-903-6395 or email police@mountainview.gov.
