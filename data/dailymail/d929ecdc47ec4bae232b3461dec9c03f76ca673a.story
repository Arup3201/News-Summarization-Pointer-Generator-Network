West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has completed his loan move to QPR for the rest of the season.

The 27-year-old Argentine will go straight into contention for QPR's Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday.

Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is expected to continue to seek another loan recruit to bolster his frontline in the January window, despite recruiting Zarate.

Zarate admitted he seized the chance to 'show what I can do' in the Premier League with QPR, after a frustrating run since joining West Ham last summer.

'I am happy. I need this, I need to play and Queens Park Rangers have given me this chance to show what I can do,' said Zarate.

'The Premier League is the best in the world at this moment.

'Does my style suit the Premier League? Maybe. We will see!

'When I met the manager he told me he wanted to sign me for Portsmouth before, but in that moment I went to Lazio. But now I am here and will play for him.

The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot

'I will try to do different things with the ball, some skills to make the difference for the team, for me and for the other players. I am fit and I hope I can be involved on Saturday.'

Zarate scored two goals in eight appearances for West Ham following his switch from Velez Sarsfield last summer.

The former Lazio and Inter Milan forward made a strong early impression at the Hammers, but has failed to edge his way past Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll in recent weeks.

Redknapp will hope Zarate can boost QPR's goal threat alongside prolific striker Charlie Austin in the Loftus Road club's Premier League survival fight.

QPR boss Redknapp has labelled West Ham outcast Zarate a 'clever No 10' 

'We're really pleased to bring Mauro in. He's a good footballer, someone with great ability who can play as a number 10,' said Redknapp.

'I first saw him when he was on loan at Birmingham quite a few years back and I actually tried to take him to Portsmouth back then.

'He's a more-than capable player, he's already shown that, and hopefully he can come in here and do well for us.'

Redknapp looks to have missed out on signing Jermain Defoe once again, with Rangers restricted to loan recruits this month.

Redknapp appears to have failed in signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC in the MLS

Toronto FC striker Defoe remains a target for a host of Premier League clubs, with the 32-year-old keen on a return to England.

The Canadian club are holding out for a full transfer to let Defoe leave however, ruling QPR out of the running.

Redknapp will continue to scout around for another loan striker this month despite bringing in Zarate however.

Former bricklayer Austin is the Premier League's top English goal scorer with 12 strikes to his name this term, but Redknapp is keen not to leave his prize asset isolated.

Bobby Zamora has continued to link play effectively but cannot last an entire match because of long-term and ongoing hip problems.
