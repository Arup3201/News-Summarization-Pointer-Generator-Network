Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s.

A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification.

It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services.

Nantwich Education Partnership sent a letter to parents warning them it will report them to police or social services if they become aware children are playing violent 18+ video games, such as Call of Duty 

The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of  games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'.

It comes amid fears children could be left more vulnerable to grooming and abuse by being exposed to early sexualised behaviour as well as extreme brutality, often seen in video games in the upper age classifications.

The letter says: 'Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Dogs of War and other similar games, are all inappropriate for children and they should not have access to them. 

'Nor should they have Facebook accounts or interact on sites or media or messaging sites like WhatsApp that are not designed for their age.' 

Nantwich Education Partnership covers 16 primary and secondary schools in Cheshire. 

The letter also warns: 'If your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is designated 18+ we are advised to contact the Police and Children’s Social Care as it is neglectful.' 

The teachers claim the games can expose children to sex and violence, making them vulnerable to abuse

There is now more pressure on teachers and social workers to report concerns about children after David Cameron announced they could face up to five years in prison if they do not speak out about suspicions children are being neglected or abused.

Department for Education guidance on safeguarding also urges school staff that they have a responsibility to identify children who are likely to suffer significant harm.  

Headteacher Mary Hennessy Jones, who helped draft the letter, told the Sunday Times: 'We are trying to help parents to keep their children as safe as possible in this digital era.' 

The letter was sent by a group of primary and secondary schools, warning people over the dangers 

Video games with an 18 classification are known for their violence. 

Call of Duty allows players to take on the role of a blood thirsty soldier in a number of violent scenarios - arming themselves with an arsenal of weapons including rifles, pistols and grenades. 

The game has been mired in controversy, with Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claiming he had trained himself to kill his 77 victims through playing the game. 

Games such as Grand Theft Auto are renowned for their violent scenes and brutality towards women 

Grand Theft Auto is well known for its violence which includes carjacking, gambling, killing and simulated sex with prostitutes. Last year Grand Theft Auto V was removed from the shelves of Australian stores Target and Kmart amid fears that the game glamorises violence against women. 

However the message from Nantwich Education Partnership has been criticised by parents as going too far, and threatening parents rather than helping them. 

Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, told the newspaper: 'Accepting the huge concerns about these violent games and their effect on children, I think the schools are stepping outside the realm of what is probably acceptable.' 

But she acknowledged that there is no a 'huge pressure' on teachers to report safeguarding concerns, placing them in an impossible situation.  

Call of Duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood-thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios.

Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed.

Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty.

French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012.

The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground.

In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin.

When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'.

Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles.

In Call of Duty gamers are armed with an arsenal of weapons and encouraged to take part in violence
