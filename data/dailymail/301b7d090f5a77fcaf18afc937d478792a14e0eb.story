Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp is contemplating giving Ravel Morrison his 'last chance' to kickstart his career in the Premier League.

The 21-year-old has a history of troublesome behaviour and has recently returned to West Ham after having his loan spell at Cardiff City cut short.

Sam Allardyce is reportedly prepared to sell that talented midfielder for a fraction of his £18million release clause - with Redknapp considering a deal for the player who helped Rangers win promotion during a three-month loan spell last season

Age: 21

Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester

Position: Midfielder

Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014)

Career appearances: 80

Career goals: 14 

Redknapp told reporters: 'I liked him. I think I might be his last chance. He has got to sort himself out. Fergie got rid of him. Sam got rid of him and they are top, top managers.

'He has obviously got to look at himself somewhere but I'm open to taking those chances with people. I have done it over the years so maybe I will do it.

'He's had problems but he's not a nasty boy. I didn't find there was anything nasty about him. He's got amazing talent but he's going to  be one of those again that's going to waste his career unless he gets his finger out quickly.' 

The midfielder has been at West Ham for two-and-a-half years and scored this great solo goal against Spurs

QPR travel to West Brom on Saturday, hoping to move out of the relegation zone - although former England captain Rio Ferdinand is likely to be sidelined yet again.

'It's been hard for Rio, and it's not been easy for me when you respect someone like I respect Rio' said Redknapp.

'It was hard when I left him out but Richard Dunne has been fantastic. I moved away from playing three at the back and it sort of scuppered the plans with Rio. But I haven't written him off by any means,' he added.
