A shamed prison officer who swapped sexy letters and phone calls with inmates could end up behind bars.

A court heard Zanib Khan had 'inappropriate relationships' with three prisoners - thought to include drug dealers - in their late 20s.

The 27-year-old shared intimate calls with male inmates on mobile phones smuggled into Brixton prison in London.

Police also found sexy love letters from prisoners at Khan's home in Ilford, east London.

Officers believe she was also close to four other prisoners over three years.

As Khan left Southwark Crown Court, where she admitted misconduct in a public office, she told The Sun: 'I've been stupid. I made a silly mistake and I have quit my job.'

Prison Service spokesman, Paul Halford, said Khan was suspended after being arrested and she subsequently resigned.

He added: 'We take the issue of staff inappropriate behavior extremely seriously.

'The vast majority of Prison Service staff are honest, hardworking and professional.

'The Prison Service seeks to create and support a culture which values integrity above all and rejects corruption and dishonesty wherever it is found.'

Khan hopes to get off with community service but could be jailed when she appears before a judge this week.

Scotland Yard's Prison Anti-corruption Team found no evidence of a sexual relationship between Khan and any of the inmates.
