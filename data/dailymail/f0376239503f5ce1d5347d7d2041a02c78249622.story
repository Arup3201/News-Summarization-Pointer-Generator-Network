When police swear to protect and serve, they do not just mean the first part, as one Portland man with the munchies discovered this week.

Two officers who had been called to the scene of an accident involving a pizza delivery driver went above and beyond the call of duty and finished the job for him.

A photograph of the two officers delivering the pizza was later posted on reddit and has since begun spreading online.

‘The officer said they would finish the delivery but we didn’t think it was true,’ redditor TheMehtevas wrote.

‘So I remade and delivered the pizza myself and this looks like the house I took it to!

‘But they were only charged for one pizza. Considering the circumstance I was more worried about my driver then 1 free pizza. Btw, he is fine!’
