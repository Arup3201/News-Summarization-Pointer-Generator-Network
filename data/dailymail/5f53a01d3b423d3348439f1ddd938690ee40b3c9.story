A new drug could bring relief for the 250,000 Britons who have the serious bowel disorder Crohn’s disease.

Vedolizumab is the first to work directly in the gut lining, targeting the inflammation that causes chronic symptoms such as diarrhoea, bleeding and fatigue.

In trials, 40 per cent of patients were free of symptoms for at least a year – with healing of the gut lining in some cases.

A new drug could bring hope to Crohn's disease patient's after the treatment is the first to work in the gut 

Vedolizumab is the biggest advance since drugs known as anti-TNFs were developed in the 1990s. Researchers at Barts Health NHS Trust say the new treatment, a course of which costs about £12,000 a year, brings ‘additional options’.

The disease may be diagnosed at any age, but it tends to strike early in life.

Sufferers have periods of good health as well as times when symptoms are more active, known as relapses or flare-ups.

Trial data shows that 40 per cent of patients taking the new treatment are free of symptoms for at least one year, with healing of the gut lining in some sufferers.

Twice as many Crohn’s patients were symptom-free as those being treated with a dummy drug, according to trial data on 2,700 patients from centres including London, Cambridge and Cardiff.

The drug made by Japan–based Takeda UK is the first of its kind, given by infusion every eight weeks, and a major advance since biologic drugs known as anti-TNFs were developed in the late 1990s.

Dr James Lindsay, Consultant Gastroenterologist and UK Principal Clinical Trial Investigator, Barts and the London NHS Trust said ‘Over a decade ago, the introduction of anti-TNFs improved the management of UC and CD in patients with moderate to severe disease.

‘Now, for these patients who can face a lifetime of chronic symptoms, vedolizumab offers an additional treatment option with a completely new mode of action that specifically targets inflammation in the gut lining.’

Many Crohn’s patients do not respond to current treatments, or the effects rapidly wear off, and they face major surgery at a very young age.

A lifetime of treatment is estimated to cost the NHS up to £720 million per year, which puts the financial burden on par with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. 

Researchers at Barts Health NHS Trust say a course of the new treatment costs about £12,000 a year
