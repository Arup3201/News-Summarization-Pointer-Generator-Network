For at least two centuries its origins have been the subject of fierce cross-Atlantic debate.

But an expert on baseball from the United States has made a 'very significant' discovery that appears to prove his country's national sport, famously as American as apple pie, was first played in England in 1749 by royalty.

Frederick Louis, son of George II, heir to the throne and the Prince of Wales, had a game with his friend Charles Sackville, Lord Middlesex, on what is now Ashley Park, in Walton on Thames.

Evidence: This cutting from the Whitehall Evening post in 1749, proves baseball came from England not America, researchers have found

A report in The Whitehall Evening Post item from 264 years ago, dated September 19 reads: 'On Tuesday last, his Royal 
Highness the Prince of Wales, and Lord Middlesex, played at Bass-Ball, 
at Walton in Surry; notwithstanding the weather was extreme bad, they 
continued playing several hours.'

American researcher and author David Block, who specialises in the study of baseball’s origins, spotted the small news piece and believes the game was played a week earlier, on September 12.

'This is a very, very significant because it is the first known baseball game involving mature adults. And it is also one of the very, very first references to baseball overall,' he said.

'In fact it is the earliest one for which the original source survives, which makes it particularly significant.'

The match was played at Ashley Park in Walton on Thames because Sackville’s wife, Grace Boyle, had inherited the 136 acre property from her parents in 1740.

English baseball will have been very different to the American version, as it would probably similar to rounders and cricket.

The then Prince of Wales who played in the first game was known to be cricket mad, and was a celebrated patron of the sport.

But until the last five years it had always been believed the sport was conceived in the United States.

The first mention of the game there came in 1791, when an order banned baseball within 80 yards of the town meeting hall in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

However, in 2008 a diary was found which described how teenagers played the game in 1755, again in Surrey.

Lawyer William Bray wrote how he took part in a match between friends in Guildford on Easter Monday that year.
