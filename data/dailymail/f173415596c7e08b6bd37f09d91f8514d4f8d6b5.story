It may be a sensitive topic in the top flights of the NFL - but Saturday Night Live pulled no punches ribbing the New England Patriots over the 'deflate-gate' controversy.

The NBC comedy show mocked the way the team has handled accusations it under-inflated pigskins in an ADC Championship game, which some claim helped pave their way to a spot in the Superbowl.

The program's opening sketch featured a mock version of coach Bill Bellichick, played by Beck Bennett, offering a flat denial he had anything to do with it, followed by blaming other people.

'Allow me to throw my quarterback under the bus': The SNL version of Bill Belichick had no trouble passing the buck

'Nerd stuff!': The show's take on Tom Brady, played by Taran Killam, played dumb and said physics was above his $26.5million paygrade

The sketch referenced a real-life press conference earlier this week, in which Belichick said he had barely even heard of the effects of under-inflated balls on footballs in his decades in the sport.

On SNL, Bennett opened his 'conference' saying: 'I have absolutely nothing to do with deflating those footballs.

'I'd like to spend the remainder of the press conference throwing my quarterback under the bus.'

In case the implication wasn't clear enough, he then said of Tom Brady: 'I love him like a son, just more of an estranged son that I wouldn't trust around footballs.'

'Brady', played by Taran Killam, then took the stage and played comically dumb about the allegations - describing the much-discussed science of ball pressure as 'nerd stuff'.

Fall guy: Bobby Moynihan, who played an assistant balls and equipment coach, eventually admitted to the controversial act

However, an attempt to rattle off the physics of pigskins as 'above my pay grade' fell apart when a fellow comic pointed out that he earns $26.5million a year.

But salvation emerged in the form of the 'assistant balls and equipment coach', played by Bobby Boynihan, who revealed that he deflated the balls as an act of devotion to Brady.

After taunting the audience with the accusation that they couldn't 'handle the truth', Moynihan then emerged with an unexpectedly blunt admission.

He said: 'Did you deflate the balls? You're damn right I did!', providing the comic NFL scandal with a much more definitive resolution than the real-life league is likely to find.
