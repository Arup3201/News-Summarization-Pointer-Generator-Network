Jonny Wilkinson has been linked with an England role in another World Cup campaign — 12 years after he kicked the team to glory in the 2003 tournament.

The 35-year-old former Lions fly-half, who retired as a player at the end of last season, is destined to act as a kicking consultant for England, according to reports in France. 

However, Sportsmail has learned that such an arrangement is far from a foregone conclusion.

It is understood that the notion of Wilkinson working with England on an ad hoc basis has been discussed and considered, following his invitation into the training camp ahead of the autumn series at Twickenham last November.

Indications on Sunday night were that the No 10 icon’s involvement with Stuart Lancaster’s squad is not entirely out of the question.

As well as a part-time coaching role at former club Toulon, Wilkinson is a World Cup ambassador, has a range of commercial commitments and is being unveiled as one of the ITV pundits for the global event on these shores later this year.
