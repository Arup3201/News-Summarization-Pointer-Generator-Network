Glasgow's emphatic support for Scotland's unsuccessful independence movement may have had a detrimental impact on tourism there, at least in the short term.

As interest from potential visitors significantly rose in the country's other major cities following the surprisingly comfortable referendum margin in favour of pro-union voters, the same cannot be said for Scotland's most populous city which was strongly in favour of leaving the United Kingdom.

Travel interest for Inverness, Edinburgh and Aberdeen increased markedly on Friday compared to the previous Friday, when Scotland's future remained uncertain and polls predicted a tight vote.

Renewed interest: After overall interest in Scotland dropped, cities such as Inverness are popular again

Searches on travel site Trivago for for accommodation in the next two months have risen by 33 per cent for Inverness, 27 per cent for Edinburgh and 10 per cent for Aberdeen since last week. Conversely, site searches for accommodation in Glasgow increased by just two per cent from the Friday before.

'This is hardly surprising considering the strength of the "yes" vote there,' said Trivago's Denise Bartlett. 'Perhaps it will take a little longer for travellers to feel comfortable visiting Glasgow again.' 

In the week leading up to the vote interest on the site for Scotland as a tourist destination had plummeted by 29 per cent year-on-year as travellers awaited the outcome of the referendum. 

'This definitely indicates an increase in travel interest from the rest of the UK to Scotland,' Bartlett said. 'Hopefully this indicates a return to normality for Scottish tourism, as it would be a shame for the country to suffer and unfortunate for visitors to miss out on everything Scotland has to offer.'

On the up: Castlegate in the city centre of Aberdeen, for which accommodation searches have risen 10%

Before the referendum there were  reports of visitors from outside Scotland cancelling holidays due to the perception of anti-English feeling in the country. 

But when asked if the 'no' vote would have any impact, positive or negative, on visitors choosing to go to Scotland from south of the border VisitScotland's spokeswoman gave a simple: 'No'.

'We are not aware of cancellations - people come to Scotland because of the friendly people, the landscapes, cities and amazing events and will continue to do so,' the spokeswoman said.

With the referendum over, Scottish tourism can now focus on the Ryder Cup golf tournament between Europe and the United States set for Gleneagles in Perthshire.
