Two San Diego police officers - a husband and wife - have been arrested on suspicion of possessing and selling drugs.

Authorities say 41-year-old Jennifer Charpentier and 32-year-old Bryce Charpentier were taken into custody Thursday morning. They were booked into jails and there's no word on whether they have lawyers.

Jennifer Charpentier has 18 years with the department and works out of the Western Division. Her husband is a six-year veteran assigned to the Mid-City Division.

Newlyweds: Jennifer and Bryce Charpentier were arrested Thursday on drugs charges

Bryce Charpentier was booked on charges of possession and sales of a controlled substance, conspiracy and being under the influence while in possession of a loaded gun.

Jennifer Charpentier was charged with conspiracy and possession and sales of a controlled substance.

County sheriff's deputies made the arrests during a drug task force investigation.

San Diego police say the officers have been placed on leave and the department is cooperating with the sheriff's investigation.

Veteran: Jennifer Charpentier is an 18-year veteran with the force, while her husband Bryce Charpentier has been with the Mid City division for six years

Bright future: The couple began dating in 2011 and married in 2013 but were both arrested and placed on leave from their positions with the police force

The two have been married since late 2013 and have four children between them.

ABC 10 reports that Mrs Charpentier was released from the Las Colinas Detention Center at 5:30am after posting $50,000 bail. Her husband was bailed earlier in the evening.

Mr Charpentier is expected to appear in court June 9, and his wife the following day.

Bryce Charpentier played mid-level professional hockey with various leagues until 2007.

Sources told ABC 10 that Mr Charpentier has had a problem with prescription drugs since he suffered a career-ending hockey injury, and that both husband and wife had been 'acting strangely' in recent months and were 'withdrawn and secretive.'

Neighbors of the Charpentiers, though, described a happy family that was always smiling, waving and playing out the front of their home.

Shocking: Neighbors say about 30 FBI agents and police officers descended on the Charpentiers' home

Residents in the Charpentiers' gated community said they were shocked to hear of the charges leveled at the family.

'I saw probably about 30 FBI agents, sheriffs, cops, all gathered around the yard,' one told San Diego 6.

Police took several items from the home and a silver SUV.

The case is the latest embarrassment for the San Diego Police Department this year.

Since February, officers from the department have been charged with a slew of crimes, including domestic violence, sexual assault against female suspects and DUI.
