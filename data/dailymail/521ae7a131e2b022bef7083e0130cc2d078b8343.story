Killed himself: Shayne Austin was once offered immunity in exchange for his testimony against Jason Autry and Zach Adams in the Holly Bobo murder trial

A key witness in the case against nursing student Holly Bobo's accused killers has been found dead.

Lawyers for Shayne Austin said Wednesday that the Tennessee man who'd once been offered immunity in exchange for his testimony against Zach Adams and Jason Autry killed himself somewhere outside the state.

According to Austin's lawyer Luke Evans, the offer of immunity had been rescinded at some point since Austin first made the agreement last March.

Prosecutors took back the offer allegedly after discovering that Austin had not been untruthful and uncooperative.

'It's unfortunate the government came in and made allegations without basis. People had to live with those allegations,' Evans told WSMV. 'Mr. Austin's position was that he was immune not just from being convicted of a crime, but charged with a crime.'

After the offer was taken away, Austin remained a person of interest in the case. An immunity hearing was scheduled for December, but had to be moved.

'They have yet to produce any specific incident to support their allegation to prove that he has been untruthful,' Evans said of his client.

Meanwhile, Adams and Autry both face charges of first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. Zach Adams' brother Dylan Adams is charged with raping Bobo.

All have pleaded not guilty.

At the time of Bobo's disappearance, her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods near her home in Parsons, located about 110 miles east of Memphis. Last September, more than three years later, authorities said two men searching for ginseng found Bobo's skull in a wooded area not far away.

Bobo, a 20-year-old Tennessee nursing student, vanished in 2011. Two suspects are set to stand trial for her slaying. However, Austin remained a suspect after prosecutors rescinded their offer of immunity on claims he was misleading them

Bobo's disappearance and the subsequent lengthy search attracted national attention as authorities distributed posters with her photograph throughout the South.

Prosecutors have not said whether they plan to seek the death penalty. Hearings scheduled for last month were postponed to an undetermined future date.

Jennifer Lynn Thompson, Adams' attorney, says state prosecutors have not even told her who found Bobo's remains or where they were found.

'I do not understand what is happening,' Thompson said. 'I have never before been involved in a case where there is no information about why my client was charged.'

In the motion to dismiss, Thompson and Fletcher Long, Autry's lawyer, asked the judge to force prosecutors to produce 'all dental record analysis and forensic studies' performed on the skull.

Adams has been in jail since March and Autry has been in jail since April. At a court hearing Dec. 17, Decatur County Circuit Judge Creed McGinley expressed concern that prosecutors had not yet provided key evidence to defense attorneys. He ordered the state to begin turning it over by Dec. 24.

Thompson says the state missed that deadline.

Then, TBI Director Mark Gwyn -- who has said the Bobo investigation has been the most exhaustive and expensive in agency history -- announced he was suspending all work on the case after District Attorney Matt Stowe accused TBI agents of misconduct.

Stowe took office Sept. 1 after defeating District Attorney Hansel McCadams, who had indicted Adams and Autry.

The dispute was only resolved after Stowe stepped down from the case and Jennifer Nichols, a Shelby County attorney who was Stowe's co-counsel on the case and who had worked with death-penalty cases, was appointed as a special prosecutor. She is the third prosecutor in the case, which Stowe said is unusual.

He said the fact that multiple prosecutors have been involved, plus the complex nature of the case, have contributed to the delays.

'We're talking about terabytes and terabytes of information,' he said.

Attorney Steve Farese, who represents the Bobo family, said the recent developments in the case are 'different' than in other cases, and he acknowledged that the family is concerned with how the case is going.

'But they understand that this is a tedious process and they want to make sure everyone has their t's crossed and their i's dotted and to get this thing done right,' Farese said.

Later, Farese added: 'No one should lose focus that this is about justice.'
