Police in Phoenix have ended the 1,800-mile reign of terror of a bank robber who killed an officer in  Tupelo, Mississippi, and wounded another.

The robber was shot dead by a Phoenix police detective during a gun battle with cops on Saturday after they intercepted him when he robbed a bank there - his third heist in just a week.

The violence ended a week of mayhem that began Monday morning in Atlanta, Georgia, and sparked a nationwide manhunt.

FBI agents are confident that the man who died in Phoenix was also responsible for the robberies in Atlanta and Tupelo because his cell phone records show he was in those places at the times of the crimes.

His clothing and behavior at the previous robberies also match the Phoenix heist.

Reign of terror: The robber pulled off two heists in one day before traveling 1,800 miles to Phoenix, where he was killed

The suspect, whose name has not been 
released, is believed to be the same man who opened fire on Officers 
Kevin Gale Stauffer and Joseph Maher, in Tupelo, Mississippi, on Monday 
when they tried to stop him as he fled a BancorpSouth robbery in 
town.

Stauffer, an Iraq War veteran and father of two, was killed. Maher was wounded and is expected to survive.

Stauffer's widow Beth publicly thanked Phoenix police for stopping the man who killed her husband.

'Gale would be proud. Today is another very emotional day in the life of our family. We can truly begin the healing process,' she said.

'We know we have not been going through this alone. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for shining a light in this time of darkness.'

Surveillance footage show the same 
suspect entering a Bank of America branch in Atlanta, armed with a 
semi-automatic handgun and wearing a black ski mask.

In a wanted poster, the suspect was described as 5-foot-8 to 6 feet tall with a slender build.

Police first started chasing the suspect on Monday when he conducted a robbery at a BankcorpSouth branch two states away in Tupelo, several hours after the Atlanta incident.

When
 the man failed again to get money from the teller, he decided to rob a customer using an ATM and that's when police intervened.

CCTV
 footage released to the public, showed one of the 
suspects in a convenience store wearing khaki trousers, white Converse 
trainers, a long-sleeved jacket and a blue ski mask.

A team of more than 100 law enforcement staff worked over Christmas Day and Boxing Day to trace the gang.

Police
 previously released a surveillance image of another 'person of 
interest; wearing a hoodie at a convenience store just minutes before 
the Tupelo robbery.

Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre spoke at the vigil, praising Cpl Stauffer, who worked for the department for eight years. The FBI set a reward for information from $152,000 to $162,500

Cpl Stauffer, a 38-year-old father of two, was laid to rest Friday in a ceremony attended by policeman from accross the South.

On
 Christmas Day, a candlelit vigil was held in the town centre for Mr 
Stauffer, a combat veteran of the Louisiana Army National Guard with 
whom he served a tour in Iraq.

Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton praised Cpl Stauffer, who 'made the ultimate sacrifice for his community'

Grieving wife Beth Stauffer told WTVA-TV: 'I have my moments. But, I'm at peace with Gale because I know he died doing something he loved.

'The way he was at work as a leader is what he was like at home.

His mother, Debbie Brangenberg, thanked
 the dozens that attended the memorial service on Wednesday, saying the 
strength of the community keeps the family strong.

She added: 'Everybody has been so wonderful to us through this week.

'And, the overwhelming love and support that this community has given us has helped us make it through.'
