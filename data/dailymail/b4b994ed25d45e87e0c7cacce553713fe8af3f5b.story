A man died after burning his buttocks in a scalding hot bath, an inquest was told.

Andrew Tomlinson, 44, endured a number of increasingly hot baths in an extreme bid to ease chronic back pain.

But the boiling water burned Mr Tomlinson’s buttocks and flank leaving him needing hospital treatment.

Andrew Tomlinson, 44, suffered from chronic back pain and when medication failed to work - he tried hot baths in an attempt to ease the pain. However, one scalded his buttocks and he was taken to Southend Hospital, pictured, where he later died from his injuries

He was admitted to Southend Hospital last month - but sadly the burns turned septic and he was declared dead just days later.

An inquest held at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court found Mr Tomlinson died as a result of an accident.

The court heard how Mr Tomlinson, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, had begun taking boiling hot baths after high-strength anti-inflammatory drugs failed to quell his chronic back pain.

A post mortem, carried out by pathologist Dr David Rouse, gave the cause of death as sepsis caused by burns.

Coroner Eleanor McGann said: 'This gentleman was having baths for chronic pain and thought the hot baths would help.

'We know from the family it was something he had been doing.

'It is very sad he was having baths so hot they have led to burns and led to sepsis.

'He did not mean to harm himself in this way and my conclusion is that this was an accidental death.'

Hot baths are recognised as treatment for short-term back pain on the NHS Choices website alongside hot water bottles, ice packs, painkillers and changing your sleeping position.

But bathers are warned to always check the temperature of the water before climbing into the tub due to the dangers of scalding water - particularly for young children and the elderly.

Hot bath water is the biggest cause of severe and fatal scalding injuries in young children.
