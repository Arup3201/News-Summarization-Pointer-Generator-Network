Cell phone shop worker Herman Reed, 33, of Boynton Beach, is accused of sending explicit texts to a 16-year-old boy

A phone shop worker has been arrested after allegedly sending  sexually explicit text messages to a boy who brought his iPhone in to be repaired.

Police in south Florida said Herman Reed Junior, 33, sent the texts to
the 16-year-old over three months and also said he wanted to give the boy a 
bi-weekly allowance.

Reed's arrest took place a sting operation run by Boynton Beach police Detective Charles Ramos, who took control of the boy's phone to pose as the teenager.

According to an arrest report, the unidentified boy made a report to police on February 20, the Sun Sentinel reported.

He told police he took his phone to a Boynton Beach AT&T 
store three months before, where a man he knew as Herman helped with 
the repair but also started asking him questions about sex.

Police said the man kept texting him.

The store is in East Gateway Boulevard, Boynton Beach, said Boynton Beach police spokesperson Stephanie Slater.

After taking the report from the boy, 
Boynton Beach police received permission from the boy and his parents to
use the phone to investigate Reed. Ramos posed as the teen.

The documents state Reed and Ramos 
were texting on February 21 when Ramos - posing as the boy - repeated 
what the teen had already said to Reed: That he was 16.

The report said: 'Reed stated that he wanted to hug me and wished that we could date.'

He then said he wanted to kiss and make love to the boy, boasting that he was good at it, according to the Sun Sentinel.

The next day, Reed sent Ramos pictures
of himself in a bow tie in striped socks. A meeting was arranged for 
5.30pm after Reed was done at work.

Police stopped Reed's pickup truck and arrested him. In questioning, Reed said that some of the conversations were 'very sexual' and that he had invited the boy to his house for movies and pizza, according to the report.

Reed also told police that what he did was wrong and told police he feared his arrest was a made-for-TV moment.

'Reed stated he was nervous thinking this was one of the shows to catch a predator,' Ramos wrote in the report.

Reed declined to comment when reached at home on Monday.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement records show that he has no prior arrests.

The Sun Sentinel reported that Ramos, who specialises in online cases, has played a role in several similar arrests in recent months.

They include the February 12 arrest of James Tracy Bradley, 46, of Delray Beach, who was taken into custody after agreeing to meet a 16-year-old boy after sending him sexually explicit texts.

The boy was actually Ramos working undercover, according to the arrest report.

In July, Wellington principal Scott Blake was arrested after an investigation by Ramos.

Blake, a respected educator before his arrest, was sentenced in January to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to enticing a minor to engage in an illegal sexual activity.

Reed faces charges of online solicitation and travelling to meet a minor for a sex act. He was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail and released on a $30,000 bail.
