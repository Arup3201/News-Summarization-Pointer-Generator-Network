The controller of a Texas bakery famed for its fruit cake has been accused of embezzling $16 million to fund a lavish lifestyle of mansions, private jets and exotic vacations.

Sandy Jenkins, who earned $50,000 a year, allegedly used 888 company checks to pay his creditors for luxury goods, and then tampered with the accounts to try to cover his tracks, Corsicana Daily Sun reported. 

He and his wife, Kay, were this week charged with money laundering over the alleged scam, which continued for eight years. 

They are accused of spending up to $250,000 a month but the disparity between Mr Jenkins' lifestyle and salary went unnoticed for years.

Target: Jenkins is accused of stealing from the 117-year-old Collin Street Bakery where he was controller

Jenkins, the 65-year-old corporate 
controller for Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, was arrested in August 
last year, and charged with ten counts of mail fraud.

He was earning $50,000 a year but the FBI claims the couple were actually spending nearer to $250,000 a month.

The FBI has seized luxury goods from Sandy and Kay Jenkins, who are accused of taking $16 million from the Collin Street Bakery: 

The couple's mansion in Corsicana, Texas, and $784,000 villa in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

596-bottle wine collection.

$2,500 Waterford Crystal 12 Days of Christmas ice bucket.

$10,000 Sex in the City 2 ring with a five carat black diamond.

Louis Vuitton luggage, Hermes handbag and other designer purses.

$60,000 Steinway piano.

Four fur coats including a $15,000 mink fur coat and a reversible mink and leather bomber jacket.

Luxury cars including a BMW X53, a Lexus, a Mercedes-Benz CL500 and a GMS Yukon XL Denali.

108 watches, including a men’s Patek Philippe 18 carat rose gold 40mm Aquanaut watch.

A collection of  Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry, more than 80 bracelets and necklaces, and 53 rings.

On Wednesday, his 63-year-old wife was indicted, and the couple will now face charges on 22 further counts, including money laundering and making false statements to a financial institution.

Jenkins is said to have claimed they were paying for their extravagant lifestyle through an inheritance. 

The couple are accused of funding a lavish lifestyle from December 2004 to August 2012.

During that time they spent $3.2 million on private jets to fly them to Aspen, Napa, Martha's Vineyard, and the Turks and Caicos islands.

They 'conspired together to maintain an extensive and lavish lifestyle through expenditures of the money embezzled from the Bakery,' the U.S. Attorney's Office told Dallas News.

Investigators claim the couple used the funds to buy a vacation home in Santa Fe; several vehicles including a Mercedes and a Lexus; a Steinway piano, six firearms, furs, jewelry, art work and an extensive wine collection.

Jenkins and his wife are also accused of running up $11 million in charges on their American Express cards.

Hayden Crawford, a partner at the 117-year-old bakery, said the company was shocked to learn of the fraud.

'When this was going down, our suspicions fell on everything except our own people. We are obviously far better at making a quality fruitcake than spotting a thief,' he said.

Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his wife is expected to self-surrender when she makes her first court appearance on March 18.

The indictment has a forfeiture allegation that would require the couple to give up the full $16,649786 taken as well as surrender two homes, four cars, $440,000 in currency seized, furs, a piano, watches, handbags, luggage and artwork.

Their Corsicana home went on the market last month for $199,500, and the proceeds will be handed over to the bakery.

The fraud went undetected for so long because of the trusting nature of the bakery's owners and what has been described as an almost-foolproof scheme.

Tristed: Sandy Jenkins had worked at the bakery from 1998

The bakery spent a huge sum on nuts for its cakes, and postage for promotional material.

Large checks were allegedly written to the nut or postal companies, and then entered into the books without an invoice number.

The checks were then canceled and the accounts' entries unchanged, before fresh checks with an electronic signature were allegedly sent to Jenkins' account.

The chief executive of the bakery also never reviewed his checks.

FBI Special Agent Christine Edson said in an affidavit that the bakery's books had not been audited since Jenkins started with the company in 1998.

Hayden Crawford, a partner at the baker, told the Star Telegram: 'We have a family-owned, family-run business where trust is foundational.'

The amount taken was just enough to not damage profits at the bakery, so although senior management were aware money was going awry, they believed it was due to mismanagement or inventory theft.

It wasn't until former bank teller Semetric Williams joined the accounts department that the fraud was revealed.

Extravagant: A stack of Louis Vuitton luggage and collection of watches including a Patek Philippe rose-gold time piece were also listed in the FBI report

In June she questioned Jenkins about 
some questionable entries, but when he brushed it off she went to senior
 management telling them she had uncovered a major embezzlement and 
feared for her life.

The unusual entry she had noted was a $20,000 check that appeared to have been written for a $10,000 postal bill.

After he was fired on June 21, Jenkins allegedly filled two Whole Foods grocery bags with jewelry, watches and $62,500 in cash.

The FBI says he tried to get his daughter to look after the bags, but when she refused they mysteriously disappeared.

A police officer later found 40lb of watches in jewelery in a Texas lake.

Appraisers for the FBI said it would cost $4.4 million to replace the couple's collection of jewelery, watches and designer goods.

If Jenkins is found guilty he could face up to 200 years in prison. He and his wife would also have to reimburse the bakery.
