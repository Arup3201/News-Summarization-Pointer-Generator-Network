As many as 80,000 Bulgarians could move to Britain when new EU rules come into force in less than six months, it emerged today.

A new survey has revealed that nearly 20 per cent of 15 to 55-year-olds - around 400,000 - want to escape their struggling country, with the UK at the top of their list.

From January 1, Britain will not be able to stop eastern European nationals taking up residence here.

Influx: Figures from the Office for National Statistics in May show 103,000 people born in Romania and Bulgaria are working in the UK

According to The Sun,
a poll by Afis carried out for the European Parliament shows the UK has
been the destination of choice for 22.5 per cent of Bulgarian migrants 
in recent years.

If the same proportion relocates next year, that could mean a further 80,000 Bulgarians coming to Britain.

Bulgaria, which has a population of 7.3million, is one of the EU's poorest countries.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the figures would put a huge strain on hospitals, schools and the benefits system.

He
told The Sun: 'According to these figures, almost 100,000 Bulgarians 
want to come here and that number may hit a million in future years.

'To stop them, we need to leave the EU - nothing else will do.'

At present, Romanians and Bulgarians can only work in Britain if they are self-employed or one of a limited number of seasonal employees who are allowed to work for six months before returning home.

But from January 1 next year, citizens from the new EU member states win the right to unlimited access to Britainâ€™s jobs market.

Just 2,000 Romanian and Bulgarians worked in Britain in 1997, which jumped to 29,000 a decade later when the two countries joined the EU. Now there are more than 100,000

More than 100,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have already come to live in this country, but under EU freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take British jobs without restrictions from January.

The poll comes a day after it emerged that half a million more immigrants arrived in Britain from the European Union than was previously believed.

It means immigration between mid-1997 and mid-2010, while Labour was in power, now totals nearly 4million, rather than the 3.4million recorded.

The number of people who went under the radar would have filled a city the size of Manchester.

A paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants

The Office for National Statistics (ONS)
discovered the mistake in May when they compared the results of the 
2011 census with the population that they had expected to find on the 
basis of births, deaths and official immigration figures, Migrationwatch
UK said.

The UK Government has so far refused to provide official estimates on immigration as ministers believe they would not be reliable.

But campaigners such as Migrationwatch UK have warned that up to 250,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could arrive in the first five years after the restrictions are lifted on January 1, 2014.

Stricter immigrations rules are being drafted by Home Secretary Theresa May, but these will not come into force until at least next Spring, so will miss the EU rule change.
