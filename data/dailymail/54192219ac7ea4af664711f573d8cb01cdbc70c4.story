Nowadays the choice of televisions available almost rivals the number of channels viewers can watch.

But despite the steady stream of plasma, flat screen and high-definition TVs on offer, more than 13,000 British householders still have black and white sets.

Almost half a century after colour programmes were first beamed into British homes, people are still paying £49 a year for a licence to watch in monochrome.

Despite the steady stream of plasma, flat screen and high-definition TVs on offer, more than 13,000 British householders still have black and white sets

The number of people with black and white licences - which are nearly £100 cheaper than the colour equivalent - has declined from 212,000 at the turn of the century to fewer than 50,000 in 2006.

Last week that number had fallen to 13,202.

Just over 2,700 monochrone licences are held in London, 574 in Birmingham, 413 in Manchester, and 256 in Glasgow.

A spokesman for TV Licensing, the body that the BBC contracts to collect the fee, said the figure was ‘remarkable’ in the digital-only era.

Iain Logie Baird, assistant curator at the National Media Museum in Bradford – and grandson of the inventor of television, John Logie Baird – said the black and white television has an enduring appeal.

‘There is a subsidy for people who still have black and white sets to keep using them, but there is a sense of nostalgia as well,’ he said.

‘The National Media Museum has hundreds of black and white television sets in its collection and I’m not surprised that people are still using them.

Nowadays the choice of televisions available almost rivals the number of channels viewers can watch. While most people want to enjoy watching shows in colour on plasma screens, some prefer to revert back to the 1950s

‘The cabinets on many of these are “retro” in their design, making them conversation pieces even when they aren’t switched on. It’s a bit like owning an antique car.

‘But perhaps most importantly, the television set has acted as a family gathering place in the home for decades now, well entrenched in our culture, and for a few who appreciate this fact, the old set can still hold a deep sentimental value.’

Television and radio technology historian John Trenouth said: ‘Although 13,202 monochrome licences may sound a lot, it’s now a tiny percentage of the 25 million licensed viewers in the UK.

‘The numbers of black and white TV sets in regular use has fallen dramatically over the last few years, hastened by the fact that it’s now almost impossible to replace them and by the need to buy a suitable set top box to continue to use them after digital switchover.

‘There will always be a small number of users who prefer monochrome images, don’t want to throw away a working piece of technology or collect old TV sets.’

Mr Logie Baird is not averse to the new technology.

‘I have a very big HD projector which I project onto the wall of my living room,’ he said.

‘I also own a cathode ray colour set from 1970, which even though not HD, is extremely watchable.’
