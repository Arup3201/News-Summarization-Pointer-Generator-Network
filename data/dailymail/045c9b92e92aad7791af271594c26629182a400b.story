A woman who sued her university last year for restricting
where she could take her guinea pig has now settled the case for $40,000.

Kendra Velzen first petitioned Grand Valley State University
officials to allow her to keep her guinea pig for ‘emotional support’ in 2011.

Velzen suffers from severe depression and also depends on the use
of a pacemaker.

Eventually, school officials allowed Velzen to keep in her
pet-free dormitory what she says was an animal prescribed to help her with her
disabling conditions.

However, Velzen and her lawyers say the approval came with
stipulations about where on campus Velzen could take the animal.

For instance, the 28-year-old could not take the guinea pig
to class or to where food was served.

For these restrictions, Velzen sued the school for failing
to provide reasonable accommodations for her disabilities under federal housing
laws.

Not fair: Court filings dropped last month alleged Grand Valley State University broke federal fair housing laws

Velzen and GVSU have now reached a settlement and Velzen
will receive $40,000, according to mlive.com.

‘The parties’ decision to enter into this agreement,’ reads
the settlement, ‘represents a compromise of disputed claims and creates the
framework for the parties to move forward without the disruption and cost of
litigation.’

Meanwhile, the university maintains it never ‘acted wrongly
or failed to act in any way with regard to Kendra Velzen.’

The case spoke to discrepancies in definition between
‘therapy animals’ and ‘service animals.’

Half sorry: Now GVSU (pictured) will pay Velzen a $40,000 settlement but maintains it followed all the rules in dealing with the student

Moving forward, GVSU says it will work with the Fair Housing
Center of West Michigan to fill in those gaps and address assistance animals
such as Velzen’s in school policy.

The school also said it will address the issue differently
if Velzen ever chooses to reapply to campus housing.

'Should Kendra Velzen ever reapply for on-campus housing and
make an accommodation request to live with a guinea pig or animal of similar
size and nature, Grand Valley will grant said request.'
