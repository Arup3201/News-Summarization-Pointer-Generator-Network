Ni Min, 14, suffers from the condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), or 'Stone Man Syndrome'

A teenage girl with stiff joints has been told her tendons and muscles are turning to solid bone.

Ni Min, 14, suffers from the condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), sometimes referred to as Stone Man Syndrome.

It is so rare, there are fewer than 600 cases in the entire world - and Ni is one of the youngest.  

The teenager, from a village near the city of Yibin, in southern China's Sichuan Province, began showing symptoms at the age of eight - and saw a succession of doctors before being diagnosed.

Her family had become concerned about the strange lumps that were appearing under her skin and her gaunt appearance.

Finally, specialists at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai revealed she was suffering from Stone Man Syndrome.

The disease, which has no cure, is considered one of the most disabling genetic conditions. It causes bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues.

Over time, this extra bone progressively restricts movement, forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone.

It eventually results in a gruesome death when the  cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe.

The patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen.

The most famous case of the syndrome was in a man called Harry Eastlack, who began to suffer at the age of 10.

By the time he died at 39, his body had almost completely turned into bone, leaving only his lips intact. 

Mr Eastlack asked that his body be donated to researchers looking for a cure for the illness after his death.

People with the syndrome need to be careful to avoid injury. 

Any swelling or inflammation will be quickly 'repaired' by the body by replacing the tissue with bone. 

If the extra bone growth is surgically removed, the body will replace the removed bone at a faster pace as well.

Despite the poor prognosis, doctors treating Ni say they hope to delay the onset of her symptoms, in a bid to prolong her life.

Dr Zhang Keqin, who is leading her treatment, said: 'At present her condition is not very serious and we have prescribed medicine for her. 

Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva is one of the rarest, most disabling genetic conditions known to medicine.

It causes bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues. 

Ridges of extra bone develop across joints, progressively restricting movement and forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone.

There are no other known examples in medicine of one normal organ system turning into another.

FOP eventually results in a gruesome death when the  cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe.

Patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen. 

'We will see how that goes over the next six months and will review it based on the way her body reacts.'

The family have been given further hope now a new medicine for treating FOP is under trial in the U.S. It is expected to hit the market next year.

Dr Zhang added: 'We hope this new drug will help. 

'Patients usually die in their 40s when they can no longer breathe because of the pressure on their lungs.' 

Ni Min's grandmother, Li Yuanchao, 65, has been a tireless campaigner for her granddaughter, taking her to medical appointments across the country in the hope of a diagnosis - and a cure. 

Over the past six years, she has spent her life savings, and her 68-year-old husband is working away from home in another city to earn more money to pay her medical expenses.

Ni says if a cure is ever discovered, she is determined to become a doctor herself and help others recover from the illness.
