A former Penthouse Pet accused of smuggling the drug 'ice' into Australia has broken down in court while detailing her former addiction and a suicide attempt.

At a sentence hearing at Sydney's District Court on Tuesday, Simone Farrow said her mother told her when she was a teenager it was OK to be a prostitute.

The 39-year-old, who is also known as Simone Cheung and by her professional name Simone Starr, was arrested in October 2009 by Australian Federal Police on her return from the United States.

It is alleged Farrow smuggled methylamphetamine inside bath products and 'large sums' had been transferred into her bank account.

Farrow said she abused prescription drugs and smoked ice daily while in the US.

'I couldn't basically function unless I smoked it,' she said.

The former model became emotional while describing her childhood, saying her mother used to lock her in a room and alleged she had taken her to a brothel when she was 17 and told her 'it was okay to do that work'.

When she was 20, Farrow said she worked at an escort agency.

While at the business she claimed a man whom she 'gave all my money to', held her by her feet over the edge of an apartment at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney's east.

Given her mother's lifestyle, which allegedly involved bouncing between partners and taking drugs, Farrow said she thought she believed she was 'a mistake'.

'I don't have any brothers and sisters,' she said.

Farrow, who suffers from a range of mental health issues, including bipolar and depression, said she's proud of being drug free for the two years and seven months she's spent in custody.

On September 13, 2013, Farrow pleaded guilty to importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug.

She denied that she was an international leader of a drug ring and claimed she had been set up. 

In court she said she was unknowingly set up by some employees who had obtained complete control of her bank, phone and email accounts and ran the drug ring behind her back. 

Ms Farrow's lawyer told the court that if buyers believed she was behind the syndicate, it was because her employees would have imitated her way of speaking in order to pass off as her.

The Australian Federal Police arrested Ms Farrow in 2012 at the Gold Coast before extraditing her to Sydney. Prosecutors maintain that she controlled the drug ring while pursuing a career in the United States as Simone Starr.

Prosecutors claim they have video footage of Ms Farrow smoking drugs and claimed in court she personally intimidated buyers who owed her thousands of dollars by threatening to send bikies to manhandle them.

The court also heard from a number of Farrows buyers who claimed they dealt directly with her, paying her $7000 per ounce. 

Farrow was a jet-setter, splitting her time between Australia's Gold Coast and a luxury apartment in Hollywood, California

A man said to be her drug dealer and whom he claims she referred to as 'dad' told the court: 'no one would [know to] call me "dad" [besides her] and no one would know the things we know,' the Sunday Telegraph reported.

He claimed the former swimsuit model was always asking him for more money and exploited their business relationship.

Mr Muratti, another witness from Melbourne who allegedly bought ice from Ms Farrow, and also claimed to have spoken directly to her.

He told the court that the drugs were shipped to him concealed as bath salts, although he conceded much of that period was a 'blur'.

The hearing continues.
