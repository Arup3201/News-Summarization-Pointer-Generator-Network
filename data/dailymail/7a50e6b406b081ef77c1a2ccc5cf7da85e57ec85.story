David Cameron today admitted he sounded 'very old' after telling a radio station that he could not understand 'why everybody is interested in the Kardashians' - and preferred Brian Ferry to pop stars Jay Z and Iggy Azalea.

The Prime Minister told Capital Xtra DJ Andre Morgan he should call him 'Dave' for the interview, aiming to reach out to younger voters.

Mr Cameron was quizzed on youth unemployment, the Chilcot inquiry and the number of black students going to university. 

But he was caught out after the presenter began testing him on his knowledge of reality TV, pop music and chain restaurants.

The DJ said said: ‘We’ve all want a very cool Prime Minister, because we’ve got a cool American President and I’m sure we can have a cool Prime Minister.'

The DJ said he wanted to 'test' the Prime Minister's 'knowledge on a few things'.

Mr Morgan presented the Prime Minister with a scenario in which he had finished Prime Minister's Questions and was at home watching TV but only reality shows were on.

‘Which one do you watch? Big Brother, Love and Hip Hop or Keeping up with the Kardashians?’ Mr Cameron was asked.

Mr Cameron responded: ‘I’m not a big brother fan. I have watched it. I haven’t quite got into why everybody is interested in the Kardashians, so maybe I’ll try the hip hop show – that sounds a bit better.

‘I like watching cooking programmes – I find that relaxing.’

Mr Morgan then asked the PM about his music favourites.

The PM said he preferred 70s pop star Brian Ferry (left) to the hip hop giant Jay Z (left)

The DJ said: ‘Barack Obama suggests you need a big artist to put together your campaign track to claw back the youth vote.

‘He suggests he’s going to bring in Jay Z for you. Prime Minister Tony Abbot calls from Australia to say Iggy Azalea is the way forward. Or do you go safe and call up Tinie Tempah to get the UK track?’

Mr Cameron said: ‘The track I would like to have – but this makes me sound so old – is ‘Let’s Stick Together’ by Brian Ferry because I think that’s the message for the election.

In his final scenario, the radio presenter said to Mr Cameron: ‘Everyone is over for the G7 summit and it’s up to you to order lunch.

‘Do you order Harvester, A Gordon Ramsay pub or do you get some chicken in from Nandos?’

Mr Cameron said: ‘I’ve been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I’ve been to Nandos and I’ve been to a Harvester. I think Nandos is the best value for money. I had a very good Nandos in Bristol.’
