Postmen are refusing to deliver letters to 60 homes on the same street because of an 'unacceptable level of risk' after one of them was bitten by a family's pitbull.

Residents of Worcester Road, a cul-de-sac in Whitebirk, Blackburn, Lancashire, have been told they must now collect their post from the local delivery office.

It comes after a seven-stone American pitbull belonging to one of their neighbours bit a postman because the child holding his lead was not strong enough to restrain the animal, police said.

Big: A family collect of Winston, the seven-stone American pitbull who bit a postman on Worcester Road, Blackburn, leading Royal Mail bosses to suspend all deliveries to the street until further notice

Worcester Road locals have branded Royal Mail's decision to stop deliveries 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous', while the dog's owner said it was 'out of order' to punish the entire street.

After the incident last Thursday, residents were ironically informed by letter that deliveries to their street had been suspended with immediate effect.

Royal Mail officials told them they could collect their mail from Blackburn Delivery Office in Canterbury Street, about two miles away, and that any post not picked up after 18 days would be returned to sender.

They gave no indication of when deliveries would begin again, although the letter did apologise to all affected customers and said staff want to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Hayley Sandiford, 28, the owner of the dog, which is called Winston, said animal now faces being neutered - but police and the RSPCA say he is not dangerous.

'He's safe': Winston's owner Hayley Sandiford, 28, says her dog now faces being neutered - but police and the RSPCA insist that he is not dangerous

'He's never bitten before and everyone round here knows that he is safe,' she said. 'I have a nine-year-old little boy and a five-year-old little girl and Winston is brilliant with them both. He follows them round and is a great family pet.

'On the day of the incident my son had put him on a lead and taken him outside. I never let him do this because I know Winston is too strong for him.

'I was looking after my friend's baby that day and so had just nipped upstairs to get her and in that split second, my little boy disobeyed me by taking the dog outside to show off to his mates.

'I heard my son scream and I looked outside. The postman had seen a dog run towards him, got scared and tried to fend him off.

'Winston had jumped up at him and bit the postman on the arm. The bite had drawn blood.

'The police and the RSPCA have been round and they've said they are happy that he is not a dangerous breed and just advised we get him neutered to calm him down a bit. He's booked in for that today.

'I think that it's out of order for Royal Mail to decided to punish the whole street for this.

'If they said that they wouldn't deliver my post anymore then I'd understand but it's just not fair on everyone else.'

Royal Mail spokesman Val Bodden said 
'Suspending deliveries is always a last resort but we take the health 
and safety of our employees very seriously and we are seeking assurances
 from the dog owners that their pet will be kept securely while we 
undertake deliveries.

'We 
apologise to all affected customers and would like to assure them that 
we will be working with the dog owners to resolve the situation as 
quickly as possible.

'In the meantime, affected customers can collect their mail from Blackburn Delivery Office on the production of photo ID.'

A spokesman from Lancashire Police said: 'The dog was on a lead at the time but the lead was held by a child, who was not strong enough to hold on to the animal.

'The postman suffered a wound to his arm and was taken to hospital to be checked over.

'The matter was passed on to the neighbourhood policing team who visited the dog's owner on a joint visit with RSPCA who gave the owner a voucher to have the dog neutered and take it to dog training classes.

'The dog was not a banned breed or classed as a dangerous dog.'

Resident Clive Fisher said he had been waiting for a letter from Royal Blackburn Hospital oncology unit after being referred by his GP because he was showing signs of cancer.

The 69-year-old said: 'An appointment letter was left undelivered at the sorting office for days.

'There's only a short period of time to treat disorders like this and I know that there's a lot of people that live on this road that do have illnesses or disabilities.'

'I'm disabled but I'm lucky that I have a car. A lot of my neighbours don't or are unable to drive.'

Another resident said: 'Why can't they just stop delivering to the house that has the dog?

'My wife is suffering from a terminal illness and she could be missing information about appointments, visits or even test results.

'She's not going to be able to go into town every day to collect the post. It's disgusting.'

Blackburn MP, Jack Straw said: 'This is obviously aggravating to the residents but postmen and women face real danger everyday and until they can be sure the area is safe I support them taking this action.

'I'm hoping to meet with residents and Royal Mail to see how this issue can be resolved.'
