Andy Carroll is expected to join West Ham on a permanent deal after Liverpool agreed to take a £20million loss on the striker.

While Carroll is yet to say yes to the move, West Ham have had a bid of £15m agreed in principle by Liverpool for a forward who cost a record £35m for a British player when he signed from Newcastle in January 2011.

Carroll is believed to be keen on moving to Upton Park but the club want a definite answer from him by the end of next week.

London calling? Andy Carroll could move permanently to West Ham after the club agreed a fee with Liverpool

The 6ft 3in Carroll yesterday pulled 
out of England’s squad for the friendlies against the Republic of 
Ireland and Brazil because of injury.

He had been recalled by head coach Roy
Hodgson last week but suffered a  heel problem in the Hammers’ final 
game of the season against Reading.

Scans have shown he needs complete 
rest. Hodgson was keen to use the friendlies to take another look at 
Carroll, who has been in outstanding form for West Ham during the last 
few weeks of his season-long loan under Sam Allardyce.

The Hammers boss admitted at the 
weekend that signing Carroll had become his top priority after his 
partnership with midfielder Kevin Nolan flourished.

Liverpool have reluctantly agreed to sell Carroll but Brendan Rodgers does not believe the target man has a future at Anfield.

He struggled to make an impact after he was signed when Liverpool wanted a replacement for Fernando Torres.

Cooled off: Newcastle had previously shown an interest in bringing Carroll back to the North East

Although his initial £65,000 a week 
salary was comparatively low, his transfer fee for an unproven Premier 
League player was incredible at the time.

He scored only four goals for 
Liverpool in the Premier League and has spent the majority of this 
campaign on loan with the Hammers.

Although the West Ham board have reservations about his injury record, they are determined to back Allardyce’s transfer plans.

Carlton Cole looks set to leave West Ham after saying goodbye to the fans on Twitter.

‘Life is filled with ups & downs 
today is a down but i’ll be back! Carlton Cole/CFC as i have been called
has left the building. i want to thank  the West Ham fans for their  
support especially the 1’s who  made the away games feel like  a home 1.

West Ham have agreed to sign Romania 
defender Razvan Rat on an initial two-year deal when his contract with 
Shakhtar Donetsk expires on July 1. The 31-year-old left back has 88 
caps.

The Hammers have also held talks with AC Milan’s out-of-contract captain Massimo Ambrosini, who will be 36 next week.

Meanwhile, Carroll has pulled out of 
England's international friendlies with Brazil and the Republic of 
Ireland suffering a heel injury.

Sportsmail understands the striker will be out for at least six weeks.

The Three Lions are scheduled to face the Republic of Ireland on May 29 at Wembley followed by a game with Brazil in Rio on June 2.

Roy Hodgson, who named his squad last Thursday, will now have to manage without the services of Carroll who ended the season as West Ham's second top goalscorer with seven league strikes to his name.

Hodgson is treating the matches as dress rehearsals for September's World Cup games against Moldova and Ukraine. He said: 'Everything I do will have an eye on the qualifiers.'

England expects: Carroll has pulled out of the national squad to take on Brazil and the Republic of Ireland

But Carroll becomes the latest 
high-profile player to pull out a squad that is already without captain 
Steven Gerrard and Arsenal's Jack Wilshere - possibly the side's two 
most influential players.

Jack Rodwell was added to the England squad on Monday after the Manchester City midfielder scored twice in his side's disappointing 3-2 defeat at home by Norwich.

He appears to have sufficiently impressed manager Hodgson to have earned a late call with Tom Cleverley a significant doubt in an already understrength squad.

Beyond Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard, the team will severely lack top-level experience in midfield.
