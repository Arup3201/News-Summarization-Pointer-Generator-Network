Supermodel Gisele Bundchen has always been fiercely proud of her Brazilian heritage - which she demonstrates in a new video as she whistles the country's national anthem.

Though she now mainly resides in the US with Superbowl-winning husband Tom Brady and her two children, she has never lost touch with her roots, a point she has stressed in the latest Vogue magazine.

The supermodel, who graces the cover of the March 2015 UK edition of the fashion bible for the 14th time, was filmed by Mario Testino in footage for the fashion power house in which she shows off her musical talents.

Throwing her head back and closing her eyes in concentration, Gisele whistles the anthem

Filmed behind the scenes at the cover shoot for the magazine, the 34-year-old can be seen laughing with the crew as she attempts a British accent, before breaking into the patriotic tune. 

Throwing her head back and closing her eyes in concentration, Gisele whistles the anthem, at times swinging her fingers along in time, before erupting into giggles. 

It is not the first time we have witnessed the model's musical talents as she fronted an H&M campaign in 2013 which saw her singing Kinks's All Day And All Of The Night to raise money for UNICEF.

However, this much more informal whistled performance was done purely for fun, as Vogue UK challenged the model to do various tasks such as juggle (which she can do surprisingly well), and touch her tongue to her nose (which she can't).  

The behind the scenes film, which was edited by Mario Testino, also shows Gisele and the photographer hard at work discussing her 14th cover shoot for Vogue 

She just knew: Giselle Bundchen revealed she knew from the moment they met that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was the one for her as she donned a green Chanel outfit for the cover of UK Vogue

In an extended version of the video, Gisele reveals the formula to how she lives her life.

'Do your best, that's my motto. Sometimes you maybe cannot do something but as long as you try that is what matters,' she said. 

And as the world's highest earning model for several years in a row, this is clearly a motto that is working well for her. 

In between the laughter we get to see Gisele hard at work, striking poses and discussing the shoot with famed photographer Mario Testino. 

She shows off her cleavage, incredibly long legs, sun-kissed skin and beachy tresses in military green Chanel.

In the accompanying interview she opens up about family life with her husband Tom Brady, 37, who she married 2007.  

The pair have two children together, Benjamin and Vivian as well as her stepson, John.

Gisele told Vogue: 'I'm very nurturing, I come from a large family and my parents were loving. But the most important thing for me as a mum is to keep my word.'
