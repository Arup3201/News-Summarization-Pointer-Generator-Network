A Sainsbury's deputy manager who was part of a lottery syndicate at work stole £4,500 from her colleagues after they won a share of the EuroMillions - and spent it paying off her gambling debts.

Susan Meakin, 42, and her colleagues scooped £4,550.60 when they matched four numbers and two lucky stars last December.

But Meakin, who was in charge of the syndicate, failed to tell the other 71 members of the syndicate about the win and used the cash to pay off some of her £30,000 gambling debts.

Meakin, 42, had the cheque for the winnings made out in her name and cashed the £4,550.60 into her own account without telling her friends

She walked free from court yesterday after admitting the theft as well as stealing £300 from a customer which was accidentally left at a self-service till where she worked.

The mother of one was handed a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months when she appeared at Nottingham Magistrates Court.

She was also ordered to repay the whole amount to the syndicate.

The court heard Meakin was deputy manager of Sainsbury's in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, when she volunteered to be in charge of the EuroMillions lottery syndicate.

Meakin kept the win secret from her colleagues at Sainsbury's Beeston store near Nottingham (pictured)

After they scooped a share of the cash on December 21 last year she had the cheque made out to herself.

Prosecutor Syma Akhtar told the court 
Meakin, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, took £500 cash from the winnings 
before depositing the rest three days after the win.

She said: 'She was only caught when she let slip the news of the win to another member of staff.'

She was sacked from her role in February this year after the thefts.

JPs said she was in a 'position of trust' which she had breached.

Magistrate Julie Handford told her: 'The position you held was one where you were trusted by your employers, by the public and by staff at the store, most of whom were junior to you.'

Maria Bines, defending, said Meakin had been struggling with a gambling addiction and had racked up debts of £30,000 through online gambling sites as well as high street arcades.

She said: 'It (the lottery syndicate) was mentioned around the lunch table and there were 72 people who were interested in taking part.

'She started gambling following the death of her father as a way of escaping.

'She started to take out loans and credit cards to pay her debts, and then took out payday loans just to pay off the debts that were accruing.

'She was of good character and worked hard all her life.'

Meakin, who is unemployed, refused to comment outside court.
