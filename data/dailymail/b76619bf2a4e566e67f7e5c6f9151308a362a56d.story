It looks like a large crudely wrapped present, but this is the actually the world's first unmanned, robot aircraft piloted by artificial intelligence.

Wrapped up in brown paper, the stealth drone was slowly pulled on to an aircraft elevator from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush today.

The vessel is scheduled to be the first aircraft carrier to catapult-launch the the X-47B drone   unmanned aircraft from its flight deck.

In development for five years, the X-47B drone is designed to take off, fly a pre-programmed mission then return to base in response to a few mouse clicks from its operator.

Under wraps: An X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) demonstrator is positioned on an aircraft elevator from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77)

It is the U.S. military's latest 
robot weapon and comes amid fears that the handing over of warfare to 
artificial intelligence could lead to disastrous unforeseen 
consequences.

The difference between the X-47B and 
previous drones is that it will not be pilot movement by movement by a 
remote - like a remote control car would be.

Instead, it will be controlled by a 
forearm-mounted box called the Control Display Unit which can 
independently think for itself, plotting course corrections and charting
new directions.

The unmanned drone will be set an 
objective by a human operator, for example a target to look at, and it 
will fly there using technology such as GPS, autopilot and collision 
avoidance sensors.

Catapult: George H.W. Bush is scheduled to be the first aircraft carrier to catapult-launch an unmanned aircraft from its flight deck

Mission: George H.W. Bush is preparing to conduct training operations in the Atlantic Ocean

Design: Tailless, cranked-kite  

Wingspan: 62ft

Length: 32ft

Max Altitude: >40,000ft

Speed: High subsonic

Max Unrefuelled Range: >2,100 nautical miles

Max Unrefuelled Flight Time: >6 hour

Take-off Weight: 44,000lbs

Powerplant: Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220U

Twin Weapons Bays: 4,500lbs payload 

The size of a jet fighter, yet 
without a tail fin, the stealth drone is produced by Northrop Grumman, 
which also produces the similar, except larger and manned, B-2 Stealth 
Bomber.

It caused a stir over the summer when
it was mistaken for a genuine UFO as it was transported through 
Washington D.C. on its way for tests at a navy airbase in southern 
Maryla.

The $6.2 billion vessel preparing to conduct training operations in the Atlantic Ocean

Longer than three football fields and
built at a cost of $6.2 billion, the USS George H.W. Bush is one of the
Nimitz class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the largest warships
in the world.

A bronze statue on its hangar bay 
deck depicts the former president as a youthful, smiling pilot in his 
flight suit. On an upper deck, a 'tribute room' presents Bush's life 
from his days in the Navy to his four years in the White House.

No other former president has visited a carrier named after him.

Ronald Reagan was the first living 
ex-president to have a carrier named in his honor, but he was unable to 
visit the vessel before he died.

Bush had served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president when he was elected in 1988 to be the nation's 41st president.

Four
years later, after a term highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf 
War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voter concerns 
about the economy.

Bush
has a long record of service, beginning with his enlistment in the Navy
in World War II. At one point, he was the nation's youngest naval 
aviator.

He was shot 
down in the Pacific and rescued by an American submarine. He's also been
a congressman from Texas, U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director.

He suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair to get around.
