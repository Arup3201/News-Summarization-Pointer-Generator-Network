Picture this: you've taken the week off work and booked a holiday on a remote tropical beach.

You land, drop of your things and walk down to the shore...Only to find a formidable mountain of thongs, plastic bottles and false teeth.

Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach, a remote and tropical area in far northern Queensland

Late last month, three tonnes of junk washed up on Old Mapoon beach in northern Queensland.

A team of Indigenous rangers and workers from the charity Tangaroa Blue Foundation spent five gruelling days cleaning the seven-kilometre shoreline.

Amongst the expanse of waste they found fishing nets, false teeth, bags full of plastic bottles (some filled with urine) and an enormous army of toy soldiers.

Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company got word of the waste from a local team of rangers.

‘We work closely with the local waste rangers. They said they had seen a lot of waste washing up in the direction of Mapoon beach, which is a hotspot for Marine debris.

‘It’s a very desolate area without many communities, so the rangers were naturally overwhelmed by the project and they called on us to come and help out.’

Mapoon is on the Gulf of Carpentaria, which gets a large amount of stray waste from the Arufuru Sea in Asia. The current then moves on towards the Northern Territory, harming all marine life in it's path.

Taylor said the labels on much of the waste showed it had come from foreign shores.

‘The labels suggest the waste was predominantly from south-east Asia, which is consistent with our prior experience.’

Taylor said that since much of the waste was plastic, it can stick around in the ocean until a big tide comes and washes it ashore.

'The fact that most of the waste is coming from international waters certainly makes it more difficult to tackle as an issue. 

Heidi Taylor, the co-founder of Tangoroa, said her company works closely with the local waste rangers (pictured above) who advise her when there is significant waste buildup

'It's a serious problem. It's impacting the marine life across the whole of the Cape York.'

It is believed that a third of turtle deaths in Australia happen from plastic ingestion. Amongst the masses of junk on the beach, the remains of local turtles were found.

'We need to work at this from a federal level using government agencies. It's the only way we can really have an impact on the waste disposal from our neighbouring countries.

'Some of this waste is coming from third world countries where there is barely no recycling institutions. The only way to impact this is through government co-operation.'

Taylor says the issue is only going to get worse. 

'The bottom-line is that our population is increasing. And more people means more waste.

'Tackling pollution needs to be a two pronged approach. We need to continue to build teams to clean up the areas that are badly effected, but we also need to look at the data and put pressure on the companies that are producing the most waste and ask them to take more responsibility.'

Tangaroa, the name for the god of the ocean in Polynesian mythology, has been operating in Australia since 2004.

The foundation has reportedly removed 3 million pieces of marine debris  from the Australian coastline.
