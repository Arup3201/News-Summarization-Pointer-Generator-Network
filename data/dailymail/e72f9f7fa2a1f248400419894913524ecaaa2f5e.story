Newly-elected NSW Labor leader Luke Foley has come clean about two drink-driving convictions in an effort to avoid the offences hurting his upcoming election campaign.

Mr Foley admitted the offences, saying he was caught by random breath tests, once at age 23 in 1993, and again in 2007, the Daily Telegraph reported.

In the first incident, 44-year-old Mr Foley said he blew about 0.07 after leaving a party in Goulburn, south of Sydney, but because his offence was low-range his licence was suspended for only a fortnight.

Mr Foley was 36 at the time of the 2007 incident, in which he blew 0.085 while driving home from a Labor Party fundraiser, and his licence was suspended for nine months.

Mr Foley, who was elected unopposed to the head of the party less than two weeks ago, said he was ashamed of the convictions.

'I'm not proud of this, in fact I’m ashamed. I've never pretended to be a perfect person but I think it's important I'm honest and upfront with people right from the start of my leadership,' he said.

'Now that I have this job, I feel I need to disclose everything about myself, warts and all. I have paid the price.'

Both incidences occurred before Mr Foley entered parliament, however he was working for the Labor party when he committed the 2007 offence.

Mr Foley was elected unopposed as leader of the NSW Labor Party 10 days ago, ahead of the state election in March.

Mr Foley, who was environment and planning spokesman, replaced John Robertson as opposition leader who quit after admitting to signing a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis as his local MP in 2011.

He was the only nominee for the party's leadership and was elected unopposed.

Linda Burney continues to serve as deputy leader.

NSW is due to go to the polls in March, with the Mike Baird-led coalition heavily favoured to be returned.

Mr Foley will now try to switch from the upper house of parliament to the lower house.

He's expected to push to become the ALP's candidate for the western Sydney seat of Auburn, held by Labor's Barbara Perry.

Mr Foley is from the party's left faction and a devoted Catholic who opposes gay marriage.
