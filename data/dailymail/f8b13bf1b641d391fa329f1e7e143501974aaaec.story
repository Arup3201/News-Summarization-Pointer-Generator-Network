The maxi dress has made a glamorous transition from being hippy chick holiday wear to being an absolute summer style staple.

Already being sported this season by the likes of Kim Kardashian and boho babe Vanessa Hudgens, it is safe to say that the maxi is making its way back into our wardrobe.

And one high-street supermarket giant has noticed a huge boom in sales with the floaty dresses proving so popular that a first run of 62,000 of them sold out in a week.

Summer trend: Maxi dresses are tipped to be a huge trend again this summer, with one high street giant noting massive sales. Myleene Klass, Jessica Alba and Kim Kardashian are all fans of the summer style

In what could be the fashion hit of the summer, more than £1 million worth of the George-branded dresses were cleared from Asda shelves in just seven days earlier this month.

The sleeveless dresses in floral patterns are clearly more suitable for better weather than most of the country is experiencing at the moment, with many bought as a holiday staple.

But the sales have also been boosted by a clever new advertising and delivery strategy from the Leeds-based chain, according to industry experts.

Asda has introduced a fast changing digital advertising campaign in stores, online and elsewhere, that reacts to the weather as it happens alongside a quick turnaround of stock on shelves.

So if it rains, all the ads start promoting waterproof clothing and staff in the shops quickly swap swimwear for wellies and so on.

Likewise, when the sun suddenly makes an appearance, adverts for shorts and t-shirts replace those for anoraks and jumpers as does the stock on the shelves.

The maxi dress ads appeared during the occasional bursts of hot weather earlier in May and sparked a stampede from customers eager to snap them up, Asda admitted.

A spokesman said: 'For the first time, George has launched clever digital advertising banners across major media outlets, which will respond immediately to changes in the weather.

'The adverts will switch between summer essentials and must-haves when the temperature increases to cover-ups, waterproofs and wellies when the weather takes a turn for the worse.'

'Maxi dresses are the perfect answer to 
the unpredictable British weather, they'll keep you cool in the sun and 
wrapped up should the weather take a turn for the worse'

 

The idea came after last year's summer proved so hard to predict with the weather constantly alternating between rain and sun, hot and cold.

Fiona Lambert, brand director for George, added: 'We sold just over £1 million of maxi dresses at the beginning of May as the temperatures increased and shoppers updated their summer wardrobes.

'Maxi dresses are the perfect answer to the unpredictable British weather, they'll keep you cool in the sun and wrapped up should the weather take a turn for the worse.

'Our summer advertising campaign showcased our commitment to provide the whole family with everything they require come rain or shine for the summer months.

'From wellies to maxi dresses, shorts and hoodies - we have summer covered for the UK whatever the weather.'
