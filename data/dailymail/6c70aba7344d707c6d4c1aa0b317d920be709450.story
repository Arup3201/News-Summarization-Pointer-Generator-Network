Spacewalking astronauts ventured out for the third time in just over a week on Sunday to complete a tricky cable job at the ISS.

In one stunning shot, Terry Virts revealed the enormity of the station against the darkness of space as his fellow astronaut, Butch Wilmore, floated almost unseen.

'Can you spot the space walker in this picture?' Virts tweeted. 'He's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the #ISS'.

In one stunning shot, Terry Virts revealed the enormity of the ISS against the blackness of space as his fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore prepared the station for future 'space taxis'.'Can you spot the space walker in this picture?' Virts tweeted. 'He's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the #ISS'

Virts also posted a space selfie and commented: 'Mission Accomplished - three #spacewalks, 800' of cable, four antennas, three laser reflectors, one greased robotic arm.'

But not everything went to plan. Dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit.

While it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out.

A mechanical gauge, however, was operating fine. Mission Control told Wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven-hour excursion.

Terry Virts took a space selfie, moments after completing the job. He wrote on Twitter: 'Mission Accomplished - three #spacewalks, 800' of cable, four antennas, three laser reflectors, one greased robotic arm'

The beautiful shot was taken on Sunday during a spacewalk in which astronaut's laid cables in preparation for future space taxis on the ISS. Terry Virts wrote: 'The camera doesn't do it justice - floating in space, looking down on creation, seeing new colour shades'

Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into American astronaut Terry Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised on Wednesday.

They were forced to spend two days analysing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week.

Engineers concluded it was the result of condensation, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit.

Virts was never in danger, according to Nasa, so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks, Friday, to install cable.

But in 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. 

Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk.

The water escaped from his suit's cooling system and Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks.

On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside.

'They're very different occurrences,' said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control.

The advance work, involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by Nasa.

The work, done by American astronauts Virts and Wilmore, meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed, as well as two antennas installed on Sunday.

A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday.

They carried out complicated work Sunday, yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half-hour spacewalk.

They spent 20 hours altogether on three outings.

Neither Virts nor Wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task. Mission Control joked by radio: 'You guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots.'

The 260-mile (418-kilometre) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world's first spacewalk by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov on March 18, 1965.

Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented. 

Even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in June.

Wilmore is due to return to Earth next week following a five and a half-month mission. Virts is midway through his expedition.

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carried them both up, with Nasa paying for the multimillion dollar tickets.

To save money and stop being so reliant on the Russian Space Agency, Nasa has hired Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station.

The two contracts are worth nearly $7 billion. SpaceX already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with Nasa.
