Most Ferris wheels rely on a motor to keep them turning - but not at this amusement park in India.

The attraction in the state of Himachal Pradesh, in Northern India, is instead turned by human workers. 

Two men are employed to stand on the spokes at the centre of the wheel and keep it turning as visitors ride in cars to take in the view. 

People power: The two acrobatic workers are seen using their legs to get the Ferris wheel moving

A video has emerged showing daredevil workers clambering over the wheel in an attempt to keep it spinning.

The video was uploaded by Manohar Thakur who filmed the footage on Friday, October 24.

Mr Thakur's boys Vijay and Ashok are seen in the video enjoying the attraction in Dhami, near Shimla in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

Some of the adventurous workers scale the railings of the Ferris wheel and they use their body weight to accelerate the speed of the wheel, while other workers apply pressure from ground level.

No safety equipment is involved - but it's not the first time human-powered Ferris wheels have been spotted in India, with several reported across the country. 

Movement: The two men jump around the centre of the ferris wheel to keep up the momentum 

Feet: The man in the green t-shirt sticks out his right leg and pushes the steel frame

Swinging: The man in the green t-shirt also swings on the bars and uses his weight to keep it moving

Momentum: The man in the navy t-shirt also pulls down on the metal bars during the short video
