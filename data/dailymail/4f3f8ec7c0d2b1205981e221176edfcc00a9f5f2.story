The social media world got to see the soft and cuddly side of the ABC on Facebook much to the bemusement of its followers.

The moderator of the social media page accidentally shared a personal post about a mother’s guilt when tucking in your children at night which was up for more than 20 minutes before the error was realised.

The first comment questioned the post saying ‘Was this meant to be posted to the ABC page? I think someone forgot to log out lol!’, while an amused follower promptly replied with ‘bahahahaha abc fail’.

Some ABC Facebook followers were quite bemused by the error while others were oblivious

But some Reddit followers sympathised with the mistake, after the post was shared on its site, saying they know how it is easily done.

‘As someone who helps to manage a popular humorous Facebook page I can relate. Switching back and forth is a hassle and it's easy to forget,’ one related.

While another commented that the error made them feel better in comparison.

‘Oh yeah, I manage a dozen or so pages, and it is easily done. Seeing a really big page do it (and leave it up for over 20 minutes now) definitely makes me feel like less of an idiot.’

When a follower expressed disappointment about not seeing the post before it was taken down another replied commenting that it: 'It was a very popular post, so I knew they'd spot it eventually.'

Reddit followers could relate to the easy mistake all too well while another expressed disappointment about not seeing the post before it was taken down

The moderator added their comment when sharing the post by saying they too experienced 'night time grumps' with their kids ’but still, they are so precious to me as well. The way they cuddle sometimes is like a big tight grab.  I guess it’s nice to be so loved.’

Some people seemed oblivious to the mistake with one agreeing that most busy mums could relate to the guilt factor.

‘Mine are grown and yet, my eyes filled and that old familiar feeling of guilt came rushing back whilst reading this,’ one parent said.
