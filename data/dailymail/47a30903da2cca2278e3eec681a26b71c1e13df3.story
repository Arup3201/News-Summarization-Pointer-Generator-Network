Human remains are being used in secretive weapons tests funded by the sale of Remembrance Sunday poppies.

Legs, feet and possibly other body parts are being imported from America and destroyed in the gruesome experiments, paid for by £5 million from Royal British Legion coffers.

The controversial tests have been conducted for four years – and now take place at a laboratory officially opened by Prince Harry last year.

Tests at the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment and help troops injured in Afghanistan 

However the use of imported limbs has been kept secret until now. The Mail on Sunday has established that limbs are regularly transported to the test centre at Imperial College, Central London, but both the Royal British Legion (RBL) and the university refused to answer key questions including:

- Whether donors or their loved ones agreed specifically for the body parts to be used in military tests.

- How many, and what particular, body parts have been used.

- Who supplies the human remains and at what price.

Last night, Shadow Universities Minister Liam Byrne said he would demand answers in Parliament about where the imported body parts came from. He said: ‘This is vital research but it has got to be conducted to world-class standards. That means proper transparency so the public know what they’re funding. Our soldiers need the world’s best protection and the world’s best treatment.’

Tests conducted at the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies (CBIS) are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment.

The limbs are used to assess the impact of weapons such as the improvised explosive devices which have killed and wounded hundreds of UK troops in Afghanistan.

Prince Harry officially opened the centre last year after the RBL – which hopes to raise £40million from the Poppy Appeal – donated £5 million, with Imperial College committing another £3 million. The research is conducted by 30 military and civilian experts in bio-engineering and bio-mechanics.

In the UK the use of body parts in research is strictly regulated by the Human Tissue Authority. The law says that remains sourced in Britain must come with the full consent of donors or their loved ones that they can be used in scientific research. But the code of practice states no such consent need be obtained if the material has been imported – saying only that it is ‘good practice to ensure mechanisms are in place in the source country for obtaining consent’.

Although Imperial College says it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements, the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from. It has admitted some remains are sourced from US companies but will not name the suppliers – making it impossible for this newspaper to establish whether donors were made aware that their body parts would be used in military tests.

Last night US donor expert Chris Truitt, who campaigns for improved rights for those who donate body parts, said: ‘Many families in America would be horrified to know that entire body parts were being sent to the UK to be blown up in a lab.

‘It is the fact that families don’t know that makes it horrific. In the US families just sign off on tissue donation for research purposes but have no idea what actually happens to their loved ones’ remains.’

Imperial College has said it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements, but the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from 

The centre’s website states that it uses ‘human tissue’ in experiments but only when pressed did a spokesman explain that body parts were used, some of which are imported.

As a result of The Mail on Sunday’s investigation, MPs on the House of Commons Health Select Committee are to probe the conduct of the centre. Committee member Barbara Keeley MP said: ‘I shall be asking questions about what can be done to ensure transparency about practices at this centre.’

An Imperial College spokesman said: ‘It is not relevant whether tissue used comes from donors in the UK, Europe or the US as long as all regulatory, consent and ethical requirements are met. All human tissue used in the course of the research has been donated to medical science with full informed consent by either the donor or their relatives.’

A Royal British Legion spokesman said the centre ‘exists to improve and advance treatment, rehabilitation and recovery after blast injury.’ He confirmed that the charity had granted £5 million to fund the centre for six years, and would review the situation after that.

The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health declined to comment.

A research department at Imperial College has agreed to source body parts from a US company linked to the illegal trade in human remains in Eastern Europe.

RTI Surgical will supply human tendons to scientists working on ways to improve surgical treatment for patients with joint injuries.

Imperial College and the Royal British Legion insisted this project has nothing to do with the tests conducted at the Centre for Blast Injury Studies.

In 2012, it was claimed that RTI Surgical was sourcing tissue from morgues in Ukraine where documents relating to the deceased were forged. In one morgue investigators found dozens of corpses stripped of all their reusable parts; while authorities intercepted a minibus crammed with bones and tissue believed to be heading for a factory ultimately owned by Florida-based RTI, one of the world’s leading suppliers of body parts.

Last night the company confirmed it ceased all operations in Ukraine following the reports, adding that it complies with relevant laws regarding consent wherever it operates.
