As the kick-off to the new season of the BBC’s flagship weekend show, it was Strictly jaw-dropping – and not always for the right reasons.

Presenter Tess Daly’s tight, bright yellow outfit had Strictly Come Dancing viewers reaching for their sunglasses.

And her ‘pillow cheeks’ left some speculating on whether she is pregnant or has had facial fillers.

Sack the stylist! Strictly Come Dancing viewers to suggest Tess Daly may want to change her stylist after she wore a tight, bright yellow dress on last night's show

Unflattering: Viewers suggested the dress was too tight and made it look like 44-year-old Miss Daly had rolls of flab around her middle

Viewers were also treated to one of the worst routines ever seen on the show, courtesy of Hairy Biker Dave Myers.

What did you think of Tess Daly's Strictly dress?

Miss Daly is known to devote months to planning her wardrobe for the series. But the dress she chose for the first show of the series on Friday night had fans wondering if it was time for a change of stylist.

The outfit was clearly too tight for her slender frame and became transparent under the glare of the lights, treating those at home to the unflattering sight of her shapewear, which had creased underneath and displayed what appeared to be rolls of flab around her middle.

Viewers tweeted complaints including ‘Tess Daly, fat or pregnant? #girdle’, ‘Can someone please tell Tess Daly that the yellow hair,  yellow face, yellow dress look on HD is iris destroying’ and ‘Is Tess daly pregnant? #SCD if not sack the stylist!’. 

Yellow overload: Many viewers complained Miss Daly's yellow dress did not go with her blonde hair or skin tone

Fashion fail: Other viewers described Miss Daly's outfit as 'trussed up' and 'horrendous'

Others described her as looking ‘trussed up’ and ‘horrendous’.

Miss Daly, 44, failed to impress on Saturday night either, with a floor-length purple dress that appeared to swamp her.

But her sartorial disasters failed to deter fans as the show once again trounced Saturday night rival The X Factor in the ratings. Strictly had an average of 9.2million viewers and peaked of 10.2million, higher than last year’s average of 8.7million, while only 7.8million watched X Factor.

Sparking rumours: A spokesman for Miss Daly said the TV presenter is not pregnant

Myers’ hapless routine was so bad that it left fans transfixed and judges laughing uncontrollably. The TV chef’s performance with Karen Hauer to the Maroon 5 single Moves Like Jagger drew comparisons with John Sergeant’s memorably bad attempt at the paso doble in 2008.

The former BBC political editor earned the nickname ‘the dancing pig as he stomped along, dragging partner Kristina Rihanoff across the floor.

Myers’ cha-cha, which left him 
languishing in last place, saw him drag Miss Hauer in similar fashion.

Judge Darcey Bussell could be seen by millions laughing uncontrollably 
and told the chef she was strangely in love with him as a result.

Craig
Revel Horwood looked far from pleased, summing up the 55-year-old’s 
performance as ‘Terrifying. I actually recoiled in horror when you came 
over to the judges desk.’

He added that  he had an overwhelming feeling 
of ‘revulsion’ when the star gyrated as part of the routine.

Abbey Clancy emerged as the favourite following her performance on Saturday night.

The
model, who is married to soccer star Peter Crouch, soared to the top of
the leader board after impressing the judges with her elegant waltz.

Miss Clancy, 27, and her professional partner Aljaz Skorjanec displayed smouldering chemistry during a routine they had appeared to be struggling with during rehearsals.

Last night a spokesman for Miss Daly said she is not pregnant and nor has she had cosmetic surgery on her face.
