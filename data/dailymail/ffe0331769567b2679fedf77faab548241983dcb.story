FIFA has decided against extending Steven Defour's ban for a reckless tackle on South Korea's Kim Shin-wook.

Belgium midfielder Defour was sent off for a studs-up challenge on the South Korean striker last Thursday's 1-0 win in Sao Paulo.

There had been calls for the Porto midfielder to be banned for more than one match, but FIFA's disciplinary committee has decided not to do so.

Defour will therefore only miss Belgium's second-round clash against the United States on Tuesday.

FIFA also confirmed the 26-year-old had been fined 7,500 Swiss Frances (£4,943) breaching its disciplinary code.
