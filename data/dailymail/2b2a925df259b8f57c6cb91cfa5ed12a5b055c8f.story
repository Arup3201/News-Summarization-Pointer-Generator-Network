A yachtsman reported missing has been found alive and well on his craft in the North Sea.

The 69-year-old from North Yorkshire, who has not been named, was last seen in the Kiel Canal in Brunsbuttel, Germany, before making the homebound journey on his 17ft yacht Equinox.

His family became increasingly concerned for his safety after not hearing from him since last Friday, prompting them to contact the Coastguard yesterday.

Rescue: Humber Coastguard (pictured) said poor weather conditions may have have meant the man got into difficulty during his crossing. It later emerged that he had changed route without telling anybody

The 
pensioner was found this morning some 80 miles east of Spurn Point, at 
the mouth of the Humber, thanks to an active emergency positioning 
beacon aboard his yacht.

Humber
 Coastguard watch manager Mike Green said: 'We are all absolutely 
delighted that this gentleman has been found alive and well.

'It
 is thanks to an excellent effort by all those involved in the search 
and rescue and is a testament to the value of emergency beacon 
equipment.'

'It
 is important that yachtsmen planning this sort of passage have adequate
 communications and log a passage plan with a shore contact.

'The more information that is available to coastguards, the more concentrated we can make our search efforts.'

Location: Humber Coastguard initiated an air search and rescue craft to sweep the area from Keil in Northern Germany to Scarborough in East Yorkshire. The man was later found safe close to Scarborough

Humberside
 Police had logged a missing person alert with Interpol, with 
investigators concluding that the man was at sea because he had not used
 his bank cards since July 3.

The
 coastguard's efforts were assisted by search and rescue helicopter RAF 
Leconfield, which made a sweep of the area from Scarborough to the 
middle of the North Sea.

An appeal was also made to the yachtsman to make contact urgently directly after the BBC shipping forecast.

German
 authorities searched around the Heligoland archipelago and a general 
alert was sent to French, Belgian, Dutch authorities.

After he was found, the yachtsman was taken aboard a UK-registered ship in the area.
