A teenage boy at one of Britain’s most expensive public schools has been arrested over allegations of ‘harassing’ a young girl by posting indecent photos of her online.

The 16-year-old is a pupil at Westminster School which charges boarders more than £30,000 a year.

Former pupils include Nick Clegg, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Helena  Bonham Carter.

A 16-year-old pupil from £30,000-a-year Westminster School has been arrested and questioned on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage

Police are understood to have been called in earlier this month after an argument between the boy, the son of a Harley Street consultant, and the girl who is also 16.

The boy was taken into custody and questioned on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage.

He was released on bail while police continue their investigations.

The girl is not a pupil at Westminster, but news of the teenagers’ dispute and subsequent police involvement is the subject of gossip at the prestigious school situated between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.

One source said: ‘Everybody’s talking about it. As we understand it, they had an argument and he posted explicit pictures of her.’

Westminster is regarded as one of Britain’s most exclusive independent schools and has a history dating back to the 11th century.

Other old boys include the spy Kim Philby and disgraced former Lib Dem Cabinet minister Chris Huhne.

Day fees start at £22,500 a  year, rising to £32,490 for boarders, who make up around a quarter of the 750 pupils.

Girls are accepted in the sixth form and number around 130.

The boy’s mother, when asked about his arrest, said this week: ‘I can’t comment, sorry.’

A member of the girl’s family said: ‘Obviously we are distraught by what has happened.

‘We are pursuing this to the bitter end and I want this boy to meet his punishment whether by the police, the courts, or by taking private action against him.’

Police are believed to have been called in after an argument between the boy and a 16-year-old girl after which he allegedly posted the picture of her online

Scotland Yard said: ‘Police received an allegation of harassment on March 5. An investigation was launched and on March 5 a boy, aged 16, was arrested on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage and was taken into custody.

‘He was subsequently bailed to a date in mid-April pending further investigation.’

According to the Department for Education, around 3,000 children are excluded from schools every year for sexual bullying, assaults and harassment.

The National Union of Teachers and charity ChildLine are deeply concerned by an increase in sexual bullying and sexting on smartphones.

Research by the Internet Watch Foundation revealed last month that four in ten teachers know of pupils taking part in sexting.

It involves naked or sexual pictures being exchanged by youngsters, often using mobile phone apps such as Snapchat or social networks such as Facebook.

The IWF said most children who swap explicit pictures with a boyfriend or girlfriend did not believe the images would be widely circulated. But they often end up being shared on social networks.
