Resplendent in a navy coat with a Wildwolf faux fur collar and carrying a bag by Irish designer Paul Costelloe, Zara Tindall happily posed with fans for some silly selfies this afternoon as she enjoyed a third day of racing action at Cheltenham.

Earlier, she had been spotted with husband Mike Tindall with both glued to their smartphones as they arrived for the traditional St Patrick's Thursday at the annual racing event.

Tindall, a former rugby player, and Zara were both chatting away on their mobiles although both put their phones away once they got inside and the racing action kicked off.

The Queen's granddaughter has become a familiar face at Cheltenham this week

The stylish royal ordered four outfits from British designer Paul Costelloe ahead of her favourite week of racing

Zara, 33, has long been a fan of racing and is developing a reputation for training point-to-point racers in her own right, having coached bay gelding Monbeg Dude to a seventh place finish in last year's Grand National. 

But today, she was happy to take a back seat, smiling and laughing with her husband as they watched jockey Ruby Walsh pilot the hotly tipped Vautour to first place in the opening race of the day, the JLT Novices Chase. 

The Queen's granddaughter has become a familiar face at Cheltenham this week, having begun it on Tuesday, when she arrived to watch the action in a chic navy coat by Paul Costelloe, from whom she ordered four separate ensembles for the week of racing. 

Earlier in the day Zara and husband Mike Tindall had been spotted glued to their own smartphones as they arrived at the St Patrick's Day event

Cheerful: Zara and Mike both looked happy to be at the racecourse and smiled as they made their way inside

Ladies' Day saw her return to the races for a second time, although she chose to spend the day with friends rather than join her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, in her private box.

Despite Zara's chic black and grey checked outfit, it was Camilla who ended up making a splash, after she bumped into glamour model Katie Price in the paddock while presenting jockey Sam Twiston-Davies with his trophy following his win in the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase.

Ms Price, 36, was in the paddock with her plasterer husband Kieran Hayler, 27, and her hairdresser when she spied Camilla and promptly sidled up to ask for a photo.

Sharing a joke: Later, Zara was spotted laughing happily with friends as she waited for the races to begin

Taking it seriously: Zara is building up a reputation for point-to-point training and last year worked with bay gelding Monbeg Dude

Not impressed: Zara looked less than impressed with the performance of one of the runners, at one point allowing herself a grimace

Has one won? Zara and her friends look on as they watch the racing action on St. Patrick's Thursday

Looking good: Zara cut an elegant figure in her blue coat, brown boots and matching velvet cocktail hat

Glamorous: On Ladies' Day, Zara arrived looking lovely in a neat black and white houndstooth coat and a black fascinator

Chic: Day one saw her dress up in an all-navy ensemble by veteran designer Paul Costelloe, from whom she has ordered four ensembles

Unexpected: Yesterday saw the Duchess of Cornwall make headlines after she was accosted in the paddock by glamour model Katie Price

Smile! The model asked for a photo with Camilla, with her daughter, Laura Lopes, also joining the pair for a photo

Having a chat: Camilla also bumped into Riders author Jilly Cooper who partially based cad Rupert Campbell-Black on her ex-husband

Family outing: As well as daughter Laura Lopes, the Duchess was also joined by her son Tom Parker-Bowles for the day

The Duchess, who cheerfully obliged, also bumped into another famous face - the author Jilly Cooper, who famously based her showjumping cad Rupert Campbell-Black on Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker-Bowles.

Ms Cooper, who lives in Gloucestershire, is no stranger to the world of racing herself, having immersed herself in it while writing her most recent novel, Jump!, which like all the Rutshire Chronicles, features Campbell-Black.

Today, however, Zara, who lives close to the racecourse at Gatcomb Park,  was the only royal in the field and took centre stage while watching the racing with her husband and a group of friends.

The presence of the royals notwithstanding, the big highlight of St Patrick's Thursday is the Pertemps Network Final, which will see veteran jockey AP McCoy back in the saddle aboard the hotly tipped Regal Encore.

Duchess doppelgangers: Day three of the Cheltenham Festival also attracted more than one Duchess of Cambridge lookalike

Hats you win: Racegoers showed off a wide range of hats, among them headbands, fedoras and feathered cocktail numbers

On trend: A lady arrives in a fashionable graphic print dress while another (right) livens up a classic country coat with pink chinos

Dressed to impress: A lady in a fur coat, left, joins a crowd that includes a well-dressed lady in pink (centre) and another in green

Showing their colours: The Cheltenham Festival went green as racegoers arrived decked out in the colours of the Irish flag

Galloping home: Ruby Walsh triumphed in the first race of the day and galloped home to win with Vautour

Packed: The Gloucestershire racecourse was awash with punters as revellers turned out on day three of the Cheltenham Festival
