Michael Gove's week is going from bad to worse.

First he was dumped from the Cabinet as Education Secretary, then he lost his first vote in his new role as government Chief Whip.

Now it has emerged he became trapped in a toilet in the Houses of Parliament and nearly missed another key vote in the Commons.

Michael Gove was ousted as Education Secretary in the reshuffle, to the delight of teaching unions, but his new job as Chief Whip does not seem to be going according to plan 

Mr Gove’s sudden departure from the Department for Education was one of the big shocks of the reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron promoted several women and Eurosceptics.

His demotion to Chief Whip, without a major department, leaves him outside the Cabinet and taking a £36,000 pay cut.

As Chief Whip, Mr Gove is charged with ensuring Tory MPs turn up to vote on legislation.

But on his first day in the job, he suffered a defeat over controversial plans for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to audit Labour’s manifesto.

In the Commons today it was claimed his attempt to make a good impression in the new job were put at risk after becoming stuck in a toilet.

Angela Eagle, Labour's Shadow Commons leader, told MPs: 'I'd like to welcome Mr Gove... he hasn't had the most auspicious of starts. 

'Yesterday, he not only lost his first vote but he managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby and he nearly broke his own whip.

'We know all about the former education secretary's love of free schools. Independent of any central authority - I wonder if he is keen to allow the emergence of lots of free Tory MPs who don't have to submit to his authority.'

William Hague, who quit as Foreign Secretary to become Leader of the Commons, insisted: 'You made fun of what he was doing yesterday - knowledge of who is in the toilets in whatever lobby is a very important piece of information for any chief whip.

'I take this as evidence he was carrying out his duties very assiduously.'

The first vote of his tenure as Chief Whip came as Labour MP Alison McGovern launched a backbench bill to enshrine the plans into law, but they are opposed by the government.

In a parliamentary ambush, Labour MPs called both aye and no when asked to agree it to trigger a vote.

With most Tory and Lib Dems MPs already heading to lunch after Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour won by 203 votes to 16.

The vote is not binding, and the bill stands no chance of becoming law, but losing a vote within hours of taking the job is embarrassing for Mr Gove. 

Earlier he was mocked in the Commons, as Labour leader Ed Miliband asked Mr Cameron: ‘We have always said we will support the Government when they do the right thing - so can I join thousands of parents across the country in congratulating you on getting rid of the Education Secretary?

'Why did you demote him?’

Mr Cameron hit back: 'Let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved. A record number of academies, new free schools, standards rising across the country, and reforms that will endure.

'But isn’t it extraordinary... on a day of a record increase in the numbers at work in our country, you will do anything not to talk about economic recovery, deficit falling, economy growing, numbers in work rising - and I’m not surprised you don’t want to talk about people in work, your own job looks a bit shaky.'

Mr Cameron heaped praise on Mr Gove's record on academies, free schools and raising standards

Playing down his surprise shift yesterday, Mr Gove said: ‘Demotion, emotion, promotion, locomotion, I don't know how you would describe this move, though move it is, all I would say is that it's a privilege to serve.’

But his removal as the face of the government’s education reforms came after polls showed he was toxic for teachers – and voters.

A new Ipsos/Mori survey yesterday showed just 22 per cent of voters say they like him, half the 44 per cent who like Mr Cameron. A huge 58 per cent said they like Boris Johnson.

Mr Gove has previously been tipped as a future Tory leadership candidate but the poll showed just 11 per cent of people think he has what it takes to be a good Prime Minister.

Almost a third (32 per cent) backed Mr Johnson as a PM, followed by 30 per cent for Theresa May and 18 per cent who thought George Osborne has what it takes.
