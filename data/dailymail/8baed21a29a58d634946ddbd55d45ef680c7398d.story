The Pakistan Cricket Board has asked the ICC to allow fast bowler Mohammad Amir to play in domestic cricket before his five-year ban ends in September next year.

PCB spokesman Agha Akbar said on Thursday that the cricket board expected the process to be completed 'within the next two months' and Amir could bowl during the first-class season that runs until May 2015.

Mohammad Amir's five-year ban for spot-fixing during a Test against England will end in August next year

Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were banned for a minimum of five years in 2010 for bowling deliberate no-balls during a Test at Lord's.

Unlike Butt and Asif, Amir didn't appeal against the ban and also underwent rehabilitation.

According to the ICC antic-corruption code, a banned player could be considered to compete in domestic cricket before his ban ends if he has shown sufficient remorse.
