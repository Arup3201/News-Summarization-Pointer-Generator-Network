Flight delays are nearly inevitable when it comes to holiday travel.

But it turns out some of the most popular winter sun destinations have particularly dismal on-time performance ratings.

New research has found that British passengers experience some of the worst flight delays while travelling between the UK and Orlando in Florida and the Spanish island of Mallorca.

Flight routes to British holiday destinations Orlando and Mallorca have particularly poor on-time ratings

Virgin Atlantic's Gatwick to Orlando route has a history of delays and an on-time percentage of just 47%

According to statistics released by worldwide passenger rights specialist refund.me, more than one in two flights on Virgin Atlantic's London Gatwick to Orlando route departed late, with return flights performing on slightly better with 59 per cent of flights departing on time.

One flight on the Gatwick-Orlando route was delayed by an astonishing five hours and 13 minutes, while a return flight endured an even longer delay of five hours and 34 minutes.

And when it comes to Palma de Mallorca, another top holiday destination, similar travel nightmares are also commonplace.

Two flights operated by Thomson from the island to London Luton and London Gatwick airports had on-time ratings of just 46 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively.

In one instance, passengers returning to Luton were left waiting for four hours and 50 minutes.

Thomson flights from Manchester had a similarly sub-standard on-time record of 56 per cent with Jet2's flights faring only slightly better with 59 per cent of flights arriving on time. 

Refund.me, which helps airline passengers claim compensation under EU legislation for delays, cancellations, missed connections and overbooking, analysed on-time records for UK airlines between August and October to find out which routes were most affected.

All flights that leave from an EU airport, regardless of the airline or destination, are covered by EU regulations which guarantee eligible passengers compensation of up to £475 for disruptions.

Two Mallorca-London flights operated by Thomson had on-time ratings as low as 46 per cent

Thomson flights from Manchester to Mallorca had a similarly sub-standard on-time record 

Likewise, passengers entering the EU on flights operated by EU carriers are also covered.

'Flight delays when going on holiday can be particularly frustrating, and can really cut into vacation time,' said Eve Buechner, founder and CEO of refund.me.

'Unfortunately it is impossible to replace lost time, but at least we enable passengers to claim compensation from airlines when they are delayed by three hours or more – and for flights up to six years ago.'
