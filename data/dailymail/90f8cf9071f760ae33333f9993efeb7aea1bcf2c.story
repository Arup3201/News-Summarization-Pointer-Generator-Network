Most people use mobile phones or e-mail.

But it seems Whitehall mandarins, like doctors, are creatures of habit and prefer old school pagers.

New figures released this week show that since 2010 Government departments spent a staggering £500,000 on outdated 80s-style pagers.

Pagers were popular with yuppies in the 80s, and it seems are still popular with civil servants

Largely redundant: Figures have revealed ministers have spent almost £500,000 on 80s-style pagers

The bill - paid for by the UK taxpayer - was racked up by eight ministries, including the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health.

But
 by far the biggest spenders were civil servants from the Ministry of Defence, which has 
2,643 of the old fashioned devices costing £9,600 a month.

Labour's
 shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: 'We knew the 
Tories' economic policy was stuck in the 1980s, but spending this amount
 on pagers seems an excessive tribute to Margaret Thatcher's era.'

However, it says its pagers are used by troops in the field.

A Government source said: 'As part of our long-term economic plan we saved taxpayers £10 billion last year by cutting the Whitehall waste which Labour never addressed in office.

'We've got rid of over 1000 pagers but won't apologise for using them when required for our soldiers in Afghanistan, those handling explosive materials and those who respond to emergency situations - is Labour really suggesting we take them away from these men and women?'

He added that there are lots of places in Government where mobile phones are banned, such as intelligence-led meetings like Cobra, because mobile phones can be tracked, and event of emergency crisis its possible mobiles will stop working.

Doctors still use pagers for when they are in hospital and need to respond to an emergency

In civilian life, the text-only gadgets 
are rarely used. Doctors and the emergency services still employ them so
 they can be contacted quickly.

They are also still used by birdwatchers keen to hear about rare sightings.

According to the Rare Bird Alert: 'To this day, pagers are still the most highly efficient
 way to receive bird news in the field.

'They work in almost every corner 
of the country, unlike mobile phones which have plenty of "reception 
black holes" especially in popular birding areas.'

Before mobile phones the gadgets - 
often called bleepers - were the only way to keep in touch on the go. 
They were notorious for being popular with yuppies and drug dealers.

Now however, they are virtually obsolete.

The
 figures emerged after a Parliamentary Question directed to Defence 
Secretary Philip Hammond was tabled by Sheila Gilmore, the Labour MP for
 Edinburgh East.

She
 asked: 'How many pagers have been provided to staff by his Department 
since May 2010; and what the cost to the Department was of providing 
those pagers.'

In a written
 answer, Ludlow MP Philip Dunne, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of 
State for Defence, said: 'In May 2010, there were 3,497 pagers in use by
 Ministry of Defence staff at a cost of around £14,000 per month.

'In December 2013, there were 2,463 pagers in use at a cost of around £9,600 per month across Defence.

'The
 number of pagers in December 2013 is 1,034 fewer than in May 2010. 
Information on the number of pagers issued since May 2010 could be 
provided only at disproportionate cost.'
