Fred William Turner Jr has been identified as the man who was shot and killed on I-4

The family of a terrified motorist who called police to say he was being followed by a gunman and was then found shot dead by the side of a road is calling for answers to his tragic killing.

Police dispatchers were on the phone with Fred William Turner Jr, pictured for the first time today, when he was shot dead on Saturday afternoon.

The 47-year-old Orlando man's body was found slumped over the wheel of his car on I-4 outside of Tampa, Florida.

One theory is that he was the victim of a violent road rage attack.

Fred Turner's ex-wife, 
who is among his closest family, says he was a reserved, quiet man and 
says she cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him.

She toldÂ 10 News off-camera she hopes someone will come forward with information leading to his killer.

One of Turner's neighbours in Orlando, who wished to remain anonymous, says he did not know why anyone would want to kill him.

'He was a nice guy. I don't see him having any enemies.'

Followed: 47-year-old Fred William Turner Jr of Orlando called 911 to report someone following him after leaving a store

Unprovoked: He told dispatchers he was on the interstate heading towards Orlando. While on the phone with police, Turner said the car following him pulled up beside him, and someone inside displayed what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon

'He stayed to himself. He was a quiet guy. I just can't believe that someone would just openly, randomly shoot him on I-4. That's horrible.'

Investigators are piecing together 911 calls, but a missing piece of the puzzle is tips from drivers who may have been in the area around 3pm on Saturday.

His death bears a chilling similarity to that of David Neel, who was shot dead in 2005 in the same area.

Neel was shot and killed on March 6, 2005 on Interstate 75, while he was heading to the Strawberry Festival in Plant City.

He was killed after someone shot through the driver's side door of his Ford F-250.

Busy route: The shooting happened on the eastbound lanes I-4 heading towards Orlando

Fatal: As Tuner approached the I-75 overpass, shots rang out and he was hit, authorities said

Neel's killing remains unsolved.

Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the latest killing took place within a few hundred yards of the 2005 attack.

Police and state troopers have launched a manhunt for the man who shot Turner Jr and searched the murder scene for clues.

The killing about 3pm on Saturday shut down the eastbound section of I-4 for almost eight hours.

Police said Turner called a 911 dispatcher that a man pulled up alongside his car, rolled down a window and brandished a semi-automatic handgun.

Turner told the dispatcher he did not recognise the man or why he was following him.

Police said Turner stayed on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, but as he drove on to the I-4 heading towards Orlando, shots rang out.

Turner pulled his car off the road and died at the scene.

Possible road rage attack: Law enforcement officials in the area are looking for a gray, newer model Ford Taurus with tinted windows

'While on the phone, the caller stated that the vehicle following him had earlier pulled up next to his vehicle and someone displayed what appeared to be a semiautomatic weapon to him,' said Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Debbie Carter said.

'At some point, for unknown reasons, the occupant, or occupants, of one vehicle fired multiple shots at the other vehicle.'

Law enforcement officials in the area are looking for a gray, newer model Ford Taurus with tinted windows.

'The caller stated that he had done nothing to cause someone to follow him,' Carter said.

Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the case looks to be road rage, but added that witnesses are still being interviewed and detectives are working to determine exactly what happened leading up the shooting.

'We're going to have to reconstruct that from the 911 tapes,' Gee said, 'but we know that we have the shooting apparently on the tape.'
