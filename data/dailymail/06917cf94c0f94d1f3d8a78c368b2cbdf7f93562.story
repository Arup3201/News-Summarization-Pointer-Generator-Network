For the sophisticated palates of the Chipping Norton Set, you might expect that nothing less than Waitrose would do.

But now locals including David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks are poised to welcome a surprising addition to their town – Aldi.

The budget foodstore has won planning permission to build an outlet on scrubland just 500 metres from the genteel High Street in the Cotswolds town. 

Aldi is planning to open a new store in the upmarket Chipping Norton, just off the town's High Street (file picture)

It’s the latest sign of the middle classes turning in increasing numbers to Aldi and fellow German discount supermarket Lidl for their shopping.

And the new store will give the Prime Minister the opportunity to counter accusations of elitism after he revealed himself to prefer Waitrose shopping earlier this year. 

Addressing John Lewis staff in April, he said: ‘I shop at various different supermarkets. I’m going to be honest with you.

‘When I’m at home in the constituency, I go to Sainsbury’s in Chipping Norton, because there isn’t a Waitrose.

The Prime Minister had previously revealed himself to be a Waitrose customer 

‘When I’m having a day in the central town in my constituency, I go to Waitrose in Witney.’

Chipping Norton’s mayor Mike Tysoe said the new budget store has had an almost unanimous welcome from residents. 

He said: ‘It ticks all the boxes across the board in the community. The area isn’t just a chocolate box picture. There are a great many rural families on very tight budgets.

‘A lot of them go once or twice a month to Aldi in Banbury for a big shop. That’s a 28-mile round trip. They are extremely happy that they’ll no longer have to do that.’

Chipping Norton is not the only middle class bastion Aldi is set to gain a foothold in, with plans for 48 new stores this year – more than any of the other supermarkets.

Other wealthy spots earmarked for the no-frills retailer include Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Epsom in Surrey and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.

Lidl, too, is expanding with plans for 15 more UK shops this year, including in upmarket places like Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.
