For the wealthy owners of a string of care homes, relaxing in the sun on a tropical island is just one of life’s little luxuries.

These pictures show Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee celebrating their daughter’s 18th birthday with a lavish family party on their native Mauritius.

But for the elderly residents being charged £500 a week in their care homes there are no such comforts.

Neglect: Last night a second care home run by the Cooppens (pictured) was closed on safety grounds

Last night a second home run by the Cooppens was closed on safety grounds.

Just three days after pensioners were left outside in their pyjamas on a bitterly cold night when Merok Park Care Home in Banstead, Surrey, was shut without notice, council officials ordered the evacuation of Grantley Court in Sutton.

Officers from Sutton Council decided to move residents to other care homes following the closure of Merok Park.

It is believed only one resident remained in Grantley Court last night. They will be cared for by staff over the weekend before being moved on Monday. 

The home was inspected by the Care Quality Commission in September and deemed ‘not safe’, with patients left at risk of infection from unclean equipment and allegations of abuse not reported properly.

A Sutton Council spokesman said it had voiced concerns to the CQC last month and made the decision on Wednesday to find alternative care for residents.

On Tuesday, 25 residents were evacuated in their night clothes from Merok Park. Inspectors were so shocked by the squalid conditions that they ordered it to be closed immediately and the pensioners ferried by ambulance to other homes.

Residents’ families described Merok Park as a ‘pigsty’. Last night they called for a police investigation and demanded to know why the Cooppens had been able to charge so much for such poor care.

Leslie Shields, whose 78-year-old father was a resident, said: ‘Someone needs to be prosecuted over this. Why should those responsible go unpunished?

‘The residents in that home were treated like animals. My father’s legs were covered in sores when he left. There needs to be a police investigation to determine whether there was criminal negligence.

‘And the people in authority who were supposed to be monitoring this home need to ask themselves why they didn’t take action before. Some people will have been using their life savings to pay for this care.’

The CQC, which had given Merok Park a clean bill of health only 11 months earlier, said it was working with the police to see if there was any criminal neglect.

Mr Cooppen, 51, and his wife, 42, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the CQC earlier this year for failing to keep proper records. The couple, who were believed to have been raking in up to £650,000 a year from each home, were unavailable to comment last night.

They live in a £2million house on a gated estate in Cheam, where yesterday four luxury cars – including a Bentley Continental – were parked on the driveway.

The Cooppens, who take frequent holidays in Mauritius, have three children, the eldest of whom, Davina, 20, is understood to be a student at Cambridge University. For Davina’s 18th birthday, they threw a lavish party. A video uploaded to YouTube shows the family and friends at the C Beach Club in the Domaine de Bel Ombre resort.

The CQC shut Merok Park, where some pensioners had their care funded by Surrey County Council, after inspectors found residents being washed in cold water and looked after by poorly-trained staff who had not been CRB checked.

They reported an overpowering smell of urine and found that some residents could not leave the top floor because the lift was broken.

In September, the CQC gave the Cooppens two months to improve Grantley Court. Inspectors said of the 30-bed home, which specialises in caring for those with dementia and disabilities: ‘People’s dignity and privacy were not respected. Doors were left open when people were undressed or using the toilet and staff did not always knock when entering people’s bedrooms. People were left in soiled, wet or poorly fitting clothing.’

The CQC said that it issued Mr Cooppen with a proposal to remove the home from its register and he had agreed to shut it. However, Sutton Council decided to evacuate residents before it closed. A council spokesman said: ‘The care of vulnerable adults is a top priority and we take our responsibilities as a council very seriously. Our officers took decisive action and reported concerns about care standards with the CQC inspectors. We have already moved residents to new accommodation and are supporting all of the families involved.’

Sally Warren, CQC’s deputy chief inspector of adult social care in London, said: ‘We will take urgent action to cancel the registration of a provider where there is a serious risk to a person’s life, health or wellbeing. At Merok Park, the lack of hot water and broken lift – alongside serious staffing issues found – prompted urgent action.

‘At Grantley Court, CQC took quick action to initiate the normal closure process while keeping the home under careful scrutiny. CQC is working closely with Sutton Council regarding Faygate House and will continue to monitor the situation very closely.’
