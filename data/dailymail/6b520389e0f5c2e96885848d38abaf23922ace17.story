Long before X-Men director Bryan Singer became entangled in a web of sex assault allegations, the filmmaker was photographed happily throwing money at a male stripper in a West Hollywood gay club.

Singer, 48, was sued last month in Hawaii by a male model named Michael Egan III, who accused the famed filmmaker of molesting him when he was 17 years old as part of a Hollywood sex ring.

Signer's attorney dismissed that the allegations of sexual abuse as 'completely fabricated.'

Accuser: Model Michael Egan III filed a lawsuit last month alleging the X-Men director sexually abused him as a teenager

More than a year earlier, in January 2013, the hard-partying Hollywood big shot spent a wild night with friends at the Abbey Food & Bar, according to Radar Online.

Mr Singer was accompanied by Francia Raisa, the 25-year-old star of The Secret Life of the American Teenager, who was caught on camera kissing the director on the lips.

In a recent interview with an LGBTQ publication, Singer described himself as ‘quite bi-sexual.’

When he was not making out with the TV actress 20 years his junior, Singer apparently kept himself busy by stuffing hundreds of dollars in cash into a male stripper's red Speedos.

'Bryan kept giving the stripper hundred dollar bills to give five to 10 minute lap dances to himself and his friends in his booth,’ an eyewitness told Radar Online.

According to some estimates, Singer spent between $700 and $800 on adult entertainment that night. His net worth is about $70million. 

Besides private dances, the X-Men director also made sure that he and his guests never ran out of drinks at the table; at the end of the night, the 48-year-old filmmaker allegedly plunked down $1,200 to cover his extensive tab.

A second lawsuit was filed earlier this month against Singer by an unnamed British teenager, who accused the director and one of his friends in the entertainment industry of trying to have sex with him against his will.

This week, Singer filed a motion to dismiss Michael Egan's lawsuit claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress, battery, assault and invasion of privacy due to lack of jurisdiction.

Despite his legal troubles, Singer's latest offering, X-Men: Days of Future Past, won the Memorial Day weekend box office by grossing $111million.
