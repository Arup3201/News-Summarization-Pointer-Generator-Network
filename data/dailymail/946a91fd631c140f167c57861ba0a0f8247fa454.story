Rupert Murdoch has backtracked on secretly-recorded claims that police probing the illegal payments scandal were 'totally incompetent'

Rupert Murdoch yesterday condemned the police inquiry into phone hacking as ‘excessive’ and ‘disproportionate’ and said it had ‘gone on too long’.

The media tycoon condemned the way journalists have been subjected to dawn raids that have ‘terrified’ their families and been made to wait for up to 18 months to hear if they would be charged.

The News Corp boss voiced frustration with the Scotland Yard investigation in two letters yesterday to House of Commons home affairs and culture, media and sport select committees.

He was asked to explain himself after he was secretly recorded in March saying – when he met News of the World and Sun journalists arrested over allegations of phone hacking and paying public officials – that the police investigation has been ‘totally incompetent’.

A transcript revealed that he had described the treatment of journalists who had been arrested as a ‘disgrace’.

In a letter to Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, Mr Murdoch admitted he had used the ‘wrong adjectives’ to describe his frustration.

But he added: ‘I do question whether, over the last two years, the police have approached these matters with an appropriate sense of proportion, and with regard for the human cost of delay.

The last time: Mr Murdoch memorably addressed the culture select committee in July 2007

My own view is that it has been more 
than thorough, indeed it has in some respects appeared to be excessive. 
My view is that this has gone on too long.’

- When
they appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday, six 
journalists were told they will stand trial at the Old Bailey over 
alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

They
are Chris Pharo, 44, Jamie Pyatt, 49, John Edwards, 49, and Nick 
Parker, 52, all from The Sun, ex-News of the World journalist Lucy 
Panton, 38, and Tom Savage, 38, of the Daily Star Sunday.
