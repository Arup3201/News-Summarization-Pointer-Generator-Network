Northerners have pilloried Evan Davis after the broadcaster suggested that the BBC should say it's based in Manchester, not Salford.

Today programme presenter Davis, 51, said the change would boost the North West's international reputation and help forge a 'mega-city' stretching from Merseyside to Leeds.

He said it was a 'serious problem' that parts of Greater Manchester such as Salford, home to the BBC's MediaCity UK since 2011, refused to simply be called 'Manchester'.

'Go back to London': said it was a 'serious problem' that parts of Greater Manchester such as Salford, home to the BBC's MediaCity UK since 2011, refused to simply be called 'Manchester'

But Northerners have reacted to his comments with disdain, with Salford's mayor calling the presenter 'London-centric' and another local suggesting that he 'go back to London'.

Davis made his proposal in an interview with the Manchester Evening News ahead of the broadcast of the second episode of his BBC2 programme Mind The Gap, which looks London's dominance among UK cities.

'Itâ€™s a serious problem for Manchester that other people refuse to be called Manchester. Itâ€™s doing it no favours. It [Salford] should be called Manchester,' he said.

He pointed out that the two cities, despite their difference in names, share the 0161 telephone area code, the M post code, and the same inter-city rail connections.

The move would help both cities to boost their 'international image' and help them to compete with European cities like Lyon, France, and Madrid, Spain, he said.

But Ian Stewart, the mayor of Salford, dismissed the suggestion. 'People clearly wonâ€™t know about Salford if we remove all mention of it from the map,' he said.

'This view is typical of a London-centric view of the world. Fortunately the British isles is more diverse than London and a handful of big cities. Our strength in the north lies is our diversity, not in all being the same.'

Salford resident Lynne Monroe echoed her mayor's sentiment.

'Salford is Salford,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'We were here before Manchester and we are proud of where we come from.

'If [Davies] doesn't like it, let him go back to London.'
