Aston Villa winger Joe Cole believes football has become a sport for 'robots' with clubs forgetting it all comes down to the 'round ball' in the end.

The former Chelsea and Liverpool star says clubs in the Barclays Premier League and beyond are turning to theories that only help 'one or two per cent'.

'You get a lot of people coming into the game - sport psychologists, etc - but, at the end of the day, it's a round ball,' says Cole.

The former Chelsea and Liverpool forward says the theories of clubs tend to only help 'one or two per cent'

'That won't change. You get all this other stuff which can help one or two per cent, but don't forget what it is to play football.

'A manager once said to me, "If you want to be good at playing the piano, you don't run round it or pick it up, you play it." That's stuck with me.'

Former England man Cole has three Premier League titles and three FA Cups to his name, and turned 33 on Saturday.

When asked about how Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho helped him at Stamford Bridge, he told the BBC: 'I'm well aware he got the best out of me. 

'Looking back, you admire what he did for me as a player. All of his players love playing for him. I loved playing for him. And I've not met a player who doesn't.'

He continues: 'Chelsea could go and become one of the great sides. They are building something special.'
