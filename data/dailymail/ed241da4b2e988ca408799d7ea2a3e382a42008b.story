Many football managers nowadays pay more attention to statistics and sports science than ever before, but few will have ever gone this far.

Professor Stephen Hawking has produced a mathematical formula to guarantee England success at this summer’s World Cup in Brazil - and also on how to take the ‘perfect penalty’.

The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances.

Technical: Professor Stephen Hawking unveils a new scientific formula to predict the chances of England succeeding in the World Cup - and another on how to take the perfect penalty, in Cambridge

Professor Stephen Hawking has produced a mathematical formula, pictured, to guarantee England success at this summer's World Cup in Brazil - and also on how to take the 'perfect penalty'

Numbers game: The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances

However, he thinks prospects for manager 
Roy Hodgson's men will be improved if they get a European referee for 
their group stage match with Uruguay on June 19.

He
 said match officials from the northern hemisphere will be less 
sympathetic to the on-pitch dramatics of the country’s mercurial striker
 Luis Suarez of Liverpool.

Professor
 Hawking, whose analysis was commissioned by bookmakers Paddy Power, has
 also come up with ‘a formula for the perfect penalty’.

He said: ‘Ever
 since the dawn of civilisation, people have not been content to see 
events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an 
understanding of the underlying order in the world. The World Cup is no 
different.’

The professor, whose book A Brief 
History Of Time was a best-seller, has appeared in shows such as The 
Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory and even starred in an advert for the 
website Go Compare.

Historical data: This graph shows how England have fared in matches against opponents from each continent

Line up: Professor Hawking said that England should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2, based on its success

He said 
England's chances of success could be worked out by examining 
‘environmental, physiological, psychological, political and tactical 
variables’.

Falling over: Professor Hawking took a swipe at 'ballerina' Luis Suarez of Liverpool and Uruguay

Professor Hawking added: ‘Statistically England's red kit is more successful and we should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2.

‘Psychologists
 in Germany found red makes teams feel more confident and can lead them 
to being perceived as more aggressive and dominant.

‘Likewise, 4-3-3 is more positive so the team benefits for similar psychological reasons.

‘The
 data shows we also need to hope for a European referee. European 
referees are more sympathetic to the English game and less sympathetic 
to ballerinas like Suarez.

‘Like
 all animals, the England team are creatures of habit. Being closer to 
home reduces the negative impact of cultural differences and jetlag. We 
do better in temperate climates, at low altitudes with kick-off as close
 to the normal three o'clock as possible.

‘The
 impact of environmental factors alone is quite staggering. A 5C rise in
 temperature reduces our chances of winning by 59 per cent.

‘We
 are twice as likely to win when playing below 500 metres (1,600ft) above sea 
level. And our chances of winning improve by a third when kicking off at
 three o'clock local time.’

Professor
 Hawking also outlined his formula for taking penalties. He said the key
 to success was a run-up of more than three steps and giving the ball 
‘some welly’, but ‘velocity is nothing without placement’.

'This will remain one of science's great mysteries': Professor Hawking said there is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score

Goalkeeper mobility: Players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty

He said: ‘If only I had whispered this in Chris Waddle's ear before he sent the ball into orbit in 1990. Use the side foot rather than laces and you are 10 per cent more likely to score.

‘The statistics confirm the obvious. Place the ball in the top left or right hand corner for the best chance of success - 84 per cent of penalties in those areas score.

‘The ability of strikers to place the ball results in them being more likely to score than midfielders and defenders.

‘There is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score. The reason for this is unclear. This will remain one of science's great mysteries.’

Paddy Power, spokesman for Paddy Power, said: ‘The modern game is so full of statistical analysis that for us it was a no brainer to call on Professor Hawking to give England some help.’

Famous: Paul the Octopus correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the 2010 World Cup, including Germany's thrashing of England and Spain's victory over the Netherlands in the final. He died later that year

Four years ago at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Paul the Octopus gained legendary status after correctly predicting the results of various games.

Professor Stephen Hawking on penalties

The tentacled creature correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the 2010 World Cup, including Germany's thrashing of England and Spain's victory over the Netherlands in the final.

He cost bookmakers thousands after floating languidly towards boxes of mussels draped in the colours of competing teams in the tournament.

He died in his sleep in October that year, but his former carers at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen, Germany, decided he should be given a shrine to mark his seemingly expert predictions.

Formula for success: Professor Stephen Hawking and Paddy Power, spokesman for Paddy Power

Professor Stephen Hawking, 72, has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but despite this cruel struggle he still became the world's most renowned astrophysicist.

He is a sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - which has robbed him of almost all physical movement

He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed.

In his incredible life his countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous awards have earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton.

But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later sampled on a Pink Floyd album.

In the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology.

This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing.

By applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales.

Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics.

In the 1980s, Professor Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time.

The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25million copies worldwide.

In recent years, Professor Hawking has examined the relationship between science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe.

He met the Pope at a scientific event hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 2008.
