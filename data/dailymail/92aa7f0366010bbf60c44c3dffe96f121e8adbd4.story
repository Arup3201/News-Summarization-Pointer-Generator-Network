British motorists have been warned to expect an increase in petrol prices after Saudi Arabia and Iran say recent falls are set to be reversed.

The price of fuel at pumps fell to a three-year low, according to figures released by the AA last week and drivers were hopeful that the decline would continue.

But Iran’s Petroleum Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has said that the downward trend in Brent crude oil prices falling to $103 per barrel will be short lived.

Middle Eastern oil superpowers have warned that petrol prices could increase after falling to three-year-low

‘The decline in crude prices is due to seasonal fluctuations and will not last,’ he told Iranian oil ministry news service Shana today. 

It comes after the chief executive of Saudi Aramco – the world’s largest state-owned oil company – Khalid al-Falih advised that in order to sustain enough investment in the future, prices would have to remain at the current level.

‘To tap these increasingly expensive oil resources, oil prices will need to be healthy enough to attract needed investments,’ al-Falih was quoted as saying at an industry conference by Reuters in The Telegraph.

‘To meet forecast demand growth and offset decline, our industry will need to add close to 40 million barrels per day (bpd) of new capacity in the next two decades.’

Out of the 12-member Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia have the largest proven oil reserves.

According to a report by global bank Citigroup, the ‘oil intensity’ of global gross domestic product has halved in the last 30 years.

It also maintains that since 2007, petrol demand in the OECD rich states has been falling from 15.5 million barrels per day of crude oil to 14 million barrels per day.  

And despite conflicts in Iraq and Ukraine, prices have remained ‘soft’.

Mr Zanganeh added: ‘These events and the presence of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) in this country [Iraq] will not significantly affect the international oil market.’

Despite the recent fall in petrol prices – which saw petrol drop to an average price of 129.18p per litre and 133.55p per litre for diesel – the UK is said to be lagging behind most of Europe.

AA public affairs head Paul Watters said last week: 'Drivers on the Continent have been enjoying these lower prices sooner. Despite the UK fuel industry's claim to sell the cheapest petrol in Europe before tax, new EU figures show that fierce competition from fuel-price regulation drove Austrian pre-tax prices even lower.’
