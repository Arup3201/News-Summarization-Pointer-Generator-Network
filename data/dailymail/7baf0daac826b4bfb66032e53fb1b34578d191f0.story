Rebel: Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, has vowed to join those voting against a policy for Lords reform, despite the fact it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide

David Cameron is braced for a crushing defeat tonight on House of Lords reform.

Up to 70 Tories are expected to rebel against a policy that tops the wish-list of their Liberal Democrat coalition partners.

One of them, Conor Burns told the Mail he will join them even though it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide.

‘When I asked the Prime Minister recently why on earth we were going to bring in this bill, he replied simply: “It’s the only thing Nick Clegg asked for in the Queen’s Speech”,’ Mr Burns said.

Downing Street is expecting the Government’s first Commons defeat, pitching the two parties of the Coalition into turmoil.

Mr Clegg was heckled by Tory MPs last night as he attacked opponents of elected peers ‘whatever the century’.

The Lib Dem leader suggested the Government might agree to fresh Commons votes to approve further stages of reform after the first tranches of peers are elected in 2015.

But as 70 Tories broke cover yesterday to say they would rebel, one senior Conservative said it would be better for the legislation to suffer a heavy defeat than a narrow one. A big loss would put Mr Cameron under intense pressure to tell Mr Clegg the plan must be abandoned.

The key vote this evening is on the timetable for the legislation, which the Government wants to limit to ten days of debate. A defeat would mean months of open-ended Parliamentary debate on the issue, snarling up other Government business.

Tory stalwart Nicholas Soames, who has defied his party only once in three decades, said the bill was a ‘constitutional catastrophe’ that ‘must be defeated at all costs’.

Mr Burns, a ministerial aide to Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, said the proposal to abolish the Lords and replace it with a mainly elected second chamber was an act of ‘constitutional vandalism’.

He claimed the Prime Minister’s private remarks about the reason for pressing ahead with the legislation showed it was a ‘Liberal Democrat obsession’.

‘But it is also a distraction for Parliament from important debate and an irrelevance to the British people. I will be proud to vote against it,’ he added.

Mr Burns wrote last night to Mr Cameron and the Government’s chief whip Patrick McLoughlin informing them of his intentions and inviting them to sack him.

Number 10 said any member of the Government voting against or abstaining in tonight’s vote would lose their job. At least one other parliamentary private secretary is expected to quit, with half a dozen more harbouring serious doubts.

Under the Government’s plans, the 
House of Lords, which will soon have 1,000 appointed and hereditary 
members, will be transformed into a democratic chamber over 15 years.

Members
will be elected in three tranches at the next three general elections, 
using a system of proportional representation designed to ensure no 
party wins an overall majority.

'Constitutional catastrophe': Tory stalwart Nicholas Soames, who has defied his party only once in three decades, said the bill 'must be defeated at all costs'

By 2025, there will be 450 members serving single 15-year terms. Eighty per cent will be elected and 20 per cent appointed by an independent commission.

Pro-reform ministers say it is high time to end the culture of cronyism which means parties appointing failed MPs, ex-ministers and donors to an unelected second house. 

But Mr Burns insisted the proposals would produce a second chamber of Parliament ‘with a new phalanx of politicians chosen from lists selected by the political parties and their ever-diminishing memberships’.

‘The quality of the debate in the Lords is enriched by the presence of captains of industry, retired senior civil servants and military figures, people from the arts and voluntary sectors, diplomats and bishops,’ he added.

‘Many are figures who would never contemplate standing for political office on a party ticket. It seems obvious to me that Parliament would be worse off if we swapped this for 400 party placemen.’ 

He warned there would be ‘no stopping’ an elected Lords challenging the supremacy of the Commons.

‘I have told the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip I cannot support the Bill. In all probability, this will mean that I have to give up my job. But it is too important to stop this act of constitutional vandalism to put career before principle.’

Mr Clegg insisted Britain was the only country in the world, other than Lesotho, that has a second parliamentary chamber that is appointed rather than elected.

‘There is neither accountability nor legitimacy in the status quo. Surely it is time to trust the British people,’ Mr Clegg told MPs.

Conservative constitutional reform minister Mark Harper urged fellow Tories to realise that Labour – which says it will vote against the Government’s timetable, but support the legislation later – was trying to damage the Coalition.

But Baroness Boothroyd of Sandwell, former speaker of the Commons, urged rebels to  wreck the bill. ‘I have never witnessed such a reckless attempt to change the British constitution and to do it on such spurious grounds,’ she said.

Every time Nick Clegg dealt with one 
bunch of enemy insurgents, another lot sprouted elsewhere. I say ‘enemy’
insurgents, but in fact they were on his own side of the Chamber: 
Tories pinging curried devilment at this gulpy, scratchy-voiced deputy 
PM.

Coalition-on-Coalition
fire. Here, Cleggy, catch this fizzing hand grenade. ‘I am very 
grateful to my Rt Hon Friend... ka-BOOM!’

Mr
Clegg opened the second reading debate of the House of Lords Reform 
Bill at 3.38pm. By 3.40 the first wave of Tory mujihadeen came screaming
over the horizon: Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills) and Peter 
Lilley (Hitchin & Harpenden).

Mr Clegg played the eeh-bah-gum card, 
trying to claim that not enough peers come from the north-east of 
England. He also felt that peers were too old. That’s a bit ageist, 
isn’t it?

Reforms: The Government plans would see appointed and hereditary peers transformed over 15 years into a democratic chamber

A friend of mine once had lunch with 
China’s Deng Xiaopeng (who kept gobbing with astonishing accuracy into a
distant spittoon). The shrivelled little fella said that in his view no
man was ready for political life until he was at least 60. But what 
would Mr Clegg (b.1967) know of that?

Instantly, more Tory 
backbenchers were up, hollering and waving their shields. Clifton-Brown,
Tredinnick, Norman, Mistress Main, Griffiths. These warriors and others
hopped and wailed. Mr Tredinnick’s voice was so high, you wondered if 
he had submitted to the surgeon’s snip. While Mr Clegg tried to provide 
answers, Steve Brine (Con, Winchester) stared bleakly at the ceiling. On
the Government bench, only two Tory big hitters (Osborne and Gove) were
present. They did their best to look bland.

Mr Clegg’s Lib Dem backbench troops 
had not all turned out to support him. Only 25 were on parade. Of these,
not all of them were necessarily ardent fans. Chris Huhne (Eastleigh) 
put in a rare appearance. He rotated his ankle and wore a dazzling 
smile. Bliss for him.

The Cleggster was just about managing to keep his 
chin above the waters, despite the hoo-hah (Labour MPs were asking 
sceptical questions, too). John Redwood (Con, Wokingham) attacked Mr 
Clegg’s policy from directly behind his right shoulder. Next to Mr 
Redwood sat Anne McIntosh (Con, Thirsk & Malton), shaking her head 
in full camera view. David Davis (Con, Haltemprice & Howden) was 
loving it. Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone looked as though she 
might start to cry.

Mr 
Clegg claimed that Sir Winston Churchill supported Lords reform. 
Churchill’s grandson Nicholas Soames (Con, Mid Sussex) rose to offer a 
more considered view. Mr Soames was genuinely irked. He said Churchill 
had altered his view as he matured. The subtext here, unless I am 
mistaken, was: you’ll grow out of this fetish, Clegg.

The
House relished the Soames intervention. Mr Clegg tried to cite past 
Labour support for his policy, only for Margaret Beckett (Lab, Derby S),
so gnarled a Comrade that she may once have taken dictation from Keir 
Hardie, to correct him. Now yet more Tories were on their feet: Dineage,
Burns, Bridgen, Rees-Mogg. For Mr Clegg it must have been like trying 
to drive a car packed with squabbling family members.

Why
is he insisting on this Bill? Easy. Lib Dems in future have little hope
of making it to Parliament unless the Lords is fixed on a PR basis.Edward
Leigh (Con, Gainsborough) suggested Clegg’s Lords would be full of 
failed politicians. Mr Clegg: ‘No. They’ll be a different kind of 
politician.’

The House hooted, Oliver Heald (Con, 
NE Herts) clapping with delight. Pete Wishart (SNP, Perth) asked if Mr 
Clegg and his Lib Dems would refuse appointment to an unreformed Lords. 
Answer came there none.

For
Labour, Sadiq Khan made an incomprehensibly jerky, glottal-stoppy 
speech, one of the worst I have heard. Not so Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Con, 
Kensington) who in six minutes of scintillating oratory attacked ‘this 
puny measure’ and its plans for ‘a sham democratic Chamber’.

They return to the debate today, but as we go into half-time young Cleggy has as much ground to recover as Poland circa 1940.
