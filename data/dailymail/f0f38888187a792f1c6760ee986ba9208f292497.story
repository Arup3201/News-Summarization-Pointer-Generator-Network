Daniel Sturridge has insisted he will step up to fill the void of Luis Suarez's departure this summer from Liverpool, and he's already been doing that off the field as he teached young winger Jordan Ibe a thing or two about rapping.

Sturridge and Ibe went head-to-head in an ultimate Hip-Hop Mastermind set up by the club's website, with a series of questions being direct at them before they both had to do a rap of their own at the end for the bonus points.

On both fronts Sturridge came through in flying colours, showing he has that winning mentality in abundance.

In the mood: Sturridge proved is a hit on and the off the pitch

The 18-minute video put on the club's YouTube sees a humerous exchange between the pair, with Sturridge ultimately giving Ibe a lesson in rapping.

The Reds are currently in America for their pre-season tour and play Manchester City in the last of their fixtures in New York on Wednesday.

This video highlighted the banter and spirit Liverpool have at the club, something they'll need in abundance this season if they are to go one better in the Premier League.
