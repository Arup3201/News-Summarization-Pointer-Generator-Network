Anthony Weiner's latest sexting partner Sydney Leathers is milking every minute of her new-found fame - she has just recorded a song and video for her single 'Weinerizer' and become an activist for legalizing marijuana.

Exclusive pictures obtained by Mail Online show the aspiring star smoking a 'blunt' - cannabis rolled with the wrapper from a cigar - while taking a rest from a busy day in a New York recording studio over the weekend.

The 23-year-old revealed she is a keen activist in the campaign to legalize marijuana and happily posed for pictures as she proudly puffed on the joint while showing off her medical marijuana card.

Working hard: Sydney Leathers is seen at a recording studio in New York City yesterday, recording a song and a music mideo called 'Weinerizer' - a parody of Britney Spears' hit single Womanizer

Wannabe pop princess: Weinerizer is a parody of Britney 
Spears' hit single Womanizer made in collaboration with Adam Barta  - 
the mastermind behind the Tanning Mom song

Meanwhile, she is working hard to get her single released in time for the September 10 Democratic primary elections.

Weinerizer is a parody of Britney 
Spears' hit single Womanizer made in collaboration with Adam Barta  - 
the mastermind behind the Tanning Mom song.

She first revealed her plans to release the music video to Howard Stern on his radio show last month.

Wearing a Peplum-style black dress accompanied with vampish black nail polish, Leathers looked every inch the pop princess and seemed extremely excited to be in the studio recording her song.

The pictures come after Weiner last night spoke about the latest scandal, admitting it had hurt his wife both personally and professionally.

It was revealed in July the mayoral candidate had a virtual relationship with Sydney Leathers a year after he had resigned from Congress.

It was around the time he and Huma posed for a People magazine spread talking about their 'normal' life and how their relationship was stronger.

During Monday's interview with Buzzfeed, Weiner said even though Huma has not been seen in public since reading a statement at his side on the day the scandal came out, she is still deeply involved.

'She's helping out every day,' he said.

Anthony Weiner's sexting mate Sydney Leathers has revealed her ten point plan for other loose women who might wish to follow her lead and seduce a lusty politician

Since the scandal has come to light, the 
23-year-old has been milking her moment in the spotlight and doesn't appear to be planning to bow out quietly or gracefully.

First she announced she was doing a porn - which is also to be released in time for the September 10 primaries.

Then she cashed in on her name by 
modelling a line of leather-based clothing after becoming the face of 
ApparalNY's latest collection

The announcement that she was 
modelling various looks for the little-known brand came at the same day a
preview of her upcoming porn video was released.

After that, the once-political blogger decided to turn things in a more literary direction by releasing a
guide to having a sexual relationship with a politician - a ten-point 
plan for others who might want to follow in her footsteps.

Using her skills: In her ten point plant for seducing a politician, Leathers paints a picture of Weiner as a deeply insecure and incredibly vain man who was constant looking for reassurance, much like a small child

Leathers is refusing to bow out of the public spotlight, much to the chagrin of New York mayoral hopeful Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin

Leathers' guide appeared on xojane.com,
the controversial and provocative women’s lifestyle website described 
as ‘where women go when they are being selfish, and where their 
selfishness is applauded'.

Much
of her unlikely advice reads like a list of lazy clichés for how one 
might go about seducing a powerful man - consisting of ego massage, 
coyness and more ego massaging – but considering what Anthony Weiner has
previously revealed about himself, every word may well be true.  

Her number one advice for snaring a politician is to ‘indulge his crazy alter-ego, and whatever you do, don't laugh at him.’

Leathers
writes that politicians require a lot of attention, needing to be 
‘coddled like a baby’ and so she says you must be prepared to be there 
for them at any time of day or night.

She isn't going anywhere: Leathers has revealed that Weiner would ask her to rate photos of him and be specific about how sexy he looked

Leathers has revealed that Weiner used to regularly trash talk current New York major Michael Bloomberg
