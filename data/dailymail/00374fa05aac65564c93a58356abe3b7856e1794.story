If they awarded Olympic golds for ‘heaviest bags under the eyes’, there would have been many contenders.

But aside from trying to stay awake after the greatest time of their lives, the international athletes heading home from Heathrow yesterday faced few of the  wearisome obstacles found in airports.

Granted, some 6ft 8in-plus members of Russia’s men’s volleyball team were forced to stoop their way through the scanners; and those proudly wearing their medals were politely asked to take them off and place them in the plastic trays along with the rest of their belongings to be security checked.

But otherwise, the temporary Games 
Terminal (basically a huge tent the size of three Olympic swimming 
pools) meant it was a day for ‘personal bests’ all round in the 
departure dash.

And there was no need to test your endurance in that 
traditional British event – the marathon queue.

For the athletes, leaving London was a
walk in the park (almost literally, given the terminal’s decor). If 
anyone’s spirits did flag, there were guardsmen in bearskins ever ready 
to lift them again.

‘Hello, Malaysia!’ bellowed one from a
sentry box, as some of that country’s divers strolled in. Cue plenty of
photos for the scrapbook as they each posed with the ‘soldier’ 
(actually, like the others, an actor).

Onward to security, where the conveyor
belts through the scanners were decorated to look like brick walls and 
adorned with iconic London street signs.

A lot of kit to carry: Olympic athletes departed from a specially built terminal at London Heathrow Airport to help cope during the busy period

A job well done: Gamesmaker volunteers walk out of the departure lounge at Heathrow's Terminal 4 after seeing off Athletes and Olympic officials

Faux neo-classical columns arched the 
athletes’ route through to an astro-turfed lounge decked out to look 
like a park (complete with more staff dressed as park wardens).

No need, of course, for 4ft 11in Jun 
Hoong Cheong, from Malaysia’s 3m springboard diving team, to duck.

Then 
off she went for more photos, this time with another two ‘guardsmen’ who
were pretending to ride on two model stags.

‘They are so cute,’ said the 
22-year-old. ‘The Olympics here has been so fine.

'I didn’t make it into 
the semi-finals but I had a great time, walking around London and 
shopping. I bought all sorts of souvenirs.’

New look: Athletes began to arrive to leave London at the temporary Games Terminal at Heathrow Airport

Is that an airport? To see the athletes off from Heathrow, the airport set up a make-shift Games terminal

Memories: A member of the Kazakhstan contingent takes a picture of a tree with Games moments hung on its branches

Nearby, a couple of Portuguese 
athletes were delighted by the near life-size cardboard cutout of the 
back of a double-decker Routemaster bus (Number: 2012; Destination: 
London) and snapped away on their cameras as they took it in turns to 
pretend boarding it.

In here, you rub shoulders with 
champions too.

Yesterday, Ireland’s gold medal-winning boxer Katie 
Taylor was boarding a flight back to Dublin.

The softly spoken 26-year-old she was looking forward to going home after the ‘most incredible two weeks of my life’.

‘It’s going to be a bit mad, so I’m a 
bit nervous,’ she said at the prospect of the almighty craic set to 
erupt on her return to the Emerald Isle, adding with a smile: ‘I’m quite
gentle out of the ring.’

Kicking back: U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte tweeted: 'It's been fun London but now it's time to get back to the good ole USA --lunch anyone??'

She could not wait to see her family, especially her grandmother Kathleen Cranley, who has just turned 80.

‘She’s always been supportive of me 
and has been living for this moment,’ Katie said. ‘It’s been an 
incredible Games and I have been privileged to be part of it.’

The feel-good factor was everywhere. 
Tumua Anae, 23, of the US’s gold medal-winning water polo team, said: 
‘The Games were awesome. The people were so good to us.

'All the volunteers were so friendly and gave us a lot of support. I have to say to Britain – you guys did a great job.’

Russia’s Maria Savinova, 27, who won 
gold in the 800m, said: ‘It’s the best Olympics, I like London. 
Yesterday I went to Big Ben – so beautiful.’

Not so upbeat? Members of the French team seemed to be sleeping off the closing ceremony at St Pancras

Busy day: More than 100,000 people are attempting to leave the capital today

That's more like it! French athletes got in the spirit of things at St Pancras before departing

There were long queues at St Pancras for the Eurostar, but the Dutch team (right) didn't seem to mind too much

About 6,000 athletes and a further 
9,000 Olympic coaches and officials were expected through the Games 
terminal yesterday, its busiest day. It will also be in use today and 
tomorrow.

No aircraft depart from it. Instead 
athletes take an airside coach to their final departure point where they
can mingle with regular passengers as they wait for their flight.

The athletes are then clapped into 
each terminal by a ‘guard of honour’ of Heathrow volunteers to wish them
luck in their future sporting endeavours in one last golden goodbye 
from London.

Golden girl: Ireland Gold medallist Katie Taylor seemed to be enjoying the new terminal

Magical moment: Katie Taylor's father, Pete, left a touching message in the Games terminal before flying back to Ireland
