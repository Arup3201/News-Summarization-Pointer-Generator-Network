Neil Warnock has told his jaded Crystal Palace players to battle on until January before he can help them out with new signings.

Palace have lodged bids for a number of players as they look to bolster their wafer-thin squad.

Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis is a £6million target while Warnock's search for a left-back has seen him identify Palermo's Achraf Lazaar.

Warnock, the Palace manager, admits he needs reinforcements with a host of weary stars nursing injuries.

He will also lose captain Mile Jedinak and star winger Yannick Bolasie, who are heading off on international duty in the new year.

Warnock said: 'We've made offers for a number of strikers and we have been looking at two or three strikers from home and abroad. They have to better than we have.

'But we are short especially as Maroune Chamakh has been out injured.

'We have lacked that physical presence up top. That will give us another dimension.

'We are also in for three or four left backs as I would like a natural left-footer as soon as possible.

'The players need a lift and helping out. They have dug deep. I've told them to hang in there and we have a good chance of improving improving the squad in the second half of the season.

'We're hoping to get one of those over the line in the first couple of weeks in the transfer window.'

The south Londoners, who also face fellow Premier League strugglers QPR and Aston Villa over the festive period, gathered momentum at this stage of last season and Warnock is hoping for a repeat.

He added: 'Last season it was important time for the club. The lads know they need to be at their best over this busy period.'
