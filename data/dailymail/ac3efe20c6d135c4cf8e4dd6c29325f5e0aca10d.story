They may  not quite have a grasp of the offside rule yet, but Dumb and Dumber stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were among those that saw Arsenal humiliated on Saturday evening.

The world famous actors were pitchside at the Emirates as Manchester United extended their unbeaten run against Arsene Wenger's Arsenal to 1,302 days and counting.

It appears English football may not be their regular go-to sport, however, with Daniels tweeting: 'Before the big match between Arsenal-Manchester United pretending to know something about soccer.'

Carrey and Daniels have been promoting their sequel to the 1994 American film Dumb and Dumber recently

Carrey and Daniels starred in the 1994 American film  and were in north London promoting Dumb and Dumber To. The sequel is due to come out on December 19, two decades after the original.

Still, the Emirates was a fitting scene to promote a film full of gaffes.

Arsenal scored a calamitous own goal through Kieran Gibbs before allowing Wayne Rooney a clear run to double United's lead on a counter-attack in the 85th minute.

Carrey and Daniels played major roles in the  American film which was released in December 1994
