Labour peer Lord Sugar tonight called for Gordon Brown to replace Ed Miliband as leader

Celebrity Labour peer Lord Sugar has called for Ed Miliband to be replaced as party leader – by Gordon Brown.

The Apprentice star said Mr Brown had been handed a ‘bad deal’ after taking over as Prime Minister from Tony Blair in 2007 just before the economic crash.

Lord Sugar welcomed the former PM’s return to the Commons today – where he spearheaded the Labour’s opposition to Tory plans to ban Scottish MPs voting on English laws.

He added: ‘I wish he’d come back as leader of the Labour Party to be honest with you.’

He told Iain Dale’s LBC radio show: ‘He took over from Blair in 2008 or 2007 when the real problems in the world economy broke and he got the blame, as far as England is concerned.

‘It’s absolutely wrong. It wasn’t his fault.’

The remarks come amid mounting pressure on Mr Miliband’s leadership following his disastrous party conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit.

In the wake of the speech some polls put the Tories ahead of Labour – leaving some backbench MPs worrying about the chances of holding on to their seats at the next election.

Mr Miliband addressed Labour MPs last night for the first time since the party scraped to victory over Ukip by 600 votes in the Heywood and Middleton by-election.

In the wake of the result there were growing calls for the party to take a harder stance against immigration.

He told the MPs that the party's chances of winning the next election would 'slip away’ unless they stop sniping at his leadership.

In a desperate plea for unity, Mr Miliband appealed to MPs to rally behind his faltering leadership – or risk being punished by the voters in May.

Addressing a private meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at Westminster last night, he insisted victory was ‘do-able’, but said: ‘Normally after an election defeat we show disunity and division.

‘Instead, we have had four years of unity. I am not going to let us, seven months before an election, start lapsing into the bad habits of the past.

‘Things are going to be more difficult. There will be ups and downs which make the last few weeks look easy. I know that we will pass that test.’

Mr Miliband was given a polite hearing by most MPs, although several attacked him over the party’s slump in the polls and failure to address the Ukip challenge on immigration.

But the Labour leader said the party could not ‘out-Ukip Ukip’. He insisted Labour had the right policies on immigration and told MPs they needed to just ‘keep going on at it’, a source told MailOnline.

Labour leader Ed Miliband last night issued a 'call to arms' to his party's MPs to back his leadership ahead of the next election

One MP said: ‘He said immigration was obviously an issue, but there’s more to it. He said there was a deeper malaise with the main political parties.

‘If there is an issue around immigration we can’t just out Ukip Ukip. He said our policy was correct and we needed to keep going on at it.’

Another MP at the meeting said Mr Miliband told them it was no good offering ‘quick fixes’ and called on the party to keep pushing Labour’s message on immigration.

In a thinly veiled rebuke to Labour MPs calling for the party to talk more about immigration Mr Miliband also told the meeting that ‘describing the problem is not a solution’.
