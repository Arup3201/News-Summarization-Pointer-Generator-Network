Mo Farah dealt the Commonwealth Games a significant blow on Thursday by withdrawing just three days before he was due to attempt a 5,000 and 10,000 metres double.

The world and Olympic champion’s ‘tough decision’ was hardly a surprise, given Farah spent two days in hospital with abdominal pains only three weeks ago and missed a substantial block of training, but his timing left fans and Games organisers disappointed.

Images of Britain’s greatest distance runner have been widely used to promote these Games and trumpet the stature of the athletics competition.

Usain Bolt (athletics)

Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha will provide some much-needed stardust and Usain Bolt is scheduled to compete in the 4x100m relay over the final weekend, but the second fastest man in history, Yohan Blake, has long said the Games were not in his ‘best interests’.

Farah’s withdrawal is another setback for Team England’s chances of success at Hampden Park. Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the favourite for  heptathlon gold in the absence of new mother Jessica Ennis-Hill, has been forced to pull out with a left foot injury and world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu only runs in the 4x400m relay.

Farah’s withdrawal means that, of the three athletes who won Olympic gold on ‘Super Saturday’ at London 2012, only long jumper Greg Rutherford is here.

Glasgow 2014 chief executive, David Grevemberg, said: ‘There’s no question we’re disappointed that Mo Farah announced he would be withdrawing. We’re very disappointed for Mo. We knew how much he wanted to be here.

‘I’m sure there will be some  disappointed people, but there are plenty of great athletes here.’

Farah, 31, has opted to stay at his training base at altitude in Font Romeu in France, rather than travel to Glasgow, after finally deciding on Wednesday night he is not in good enough shape.

It is understood he considered forfeiting the 5,000m on Sunday to give him five days’ extra recovery for the 10,000m on Friday, but  ultimately opted to sidestep  the Games altogether after  discussions with his coach, Alberto Salazar, and British Athletics  performance director Neil Black.

Farah said in a statement: ‘I  have taken the tough decision to  withdraw from the Commonwealth Games. The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me. Training is getting better here in Font Romeu but I need another few weeks to get back to the level I was at in 2012 and 2013.

Blow for Glasgow: Usain Bolt will only take part in the 100m relay while Yohan Blake (below) has pulled out

‘I really wanted to add the Commonwealth 
titles to my Olympic and World Championships but the event is coming a 
few weeks too soon for me as my body is telling me it’s not ready to 
race yet.’

Farah is still, however, intending to compete in the 
5,000m and 10,000m at the European Championships in Zurich in August, 
and British Athletics officials remain confident he will finally reach 
the start line after pulling out of the Glasgow Grand Prix and London 
Anniversary Games in recent weeks.

His competition within Europe, is 
significantly inferior to Kenyans he might have faced in Glasgow — 
including Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku, 21, who has run 13min 01.71sec for 
5,000m this year. Farah has managed only 13min 23.42sec, after he 
returned to the track following his eighth place in the London Marathon 
in April, but was understood to be ‘flying’ in training in the States 
before  suffering stomach pains.
