In one man's world, your house can be destroyed, you can continue to make its mortgage payments, yet it can still be foreclosed.

That's the situation for Brad Gana, a Texas man whose home was washed away in 2008 by Hurricane Ike who continued to make its mortgage payments, before the bank arrived, confiscating whatever items they could get.

'I was shocked when they said they were foreclosing on it,' Brad Gana told investigator Amy Davis, according to KPRC-TV.

'Shocked': Brad Gana says he paid all of his mortgage payments on time, despite no longer having a house to live in after a natural disaster, but his bank still foreclosed on him

Mr Gana was working overseas when the hurricane hit his neighborhood of Sea Brook, completely destroying his home.

But even then he says he never missed a single mortgage payment for his home, which no longer existed.

It was in fact left as a rumbled slab of concrete.

So when his bank contacted him, telling him they were foreclosing on him, despite payment he said he was making, he was stunned.

'It wasn't until about 20 calls that someone said, 'We had a homeowner's policy on your home that you reside in, and your monthly payments have gone up,'' Mr Gana told KPRC.

Mr Gana says he first learned of the foreclosure just two days before he planned to sell his property.

Hiring an attorney to stop the 
procedure, which was successful, Bank of America still arrived at his 
property, removing any personal items that were available like his tools
and collectibles, all of which are now gone.

Reached for comment, a representative with Bank of America sent an email to the investigator, Ms Davis, admitting that the bank had 'incorrectly placed insurance' on a home that no longer existed.

The representative said they will have to audit his account to correct any discrepancies.

'Bank of America is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded.

The representative with the bank said that they had tried to reach Mr Gana earlier on his homeowner's policy and changed mortgage amount, but all of their efforts mailed were returned. 

Mr Gana offers one argument to that: his mailbox was destroyed.

But either way, he says had provided the bank with an email address he could be reached at, as well as two phone numbers to where he was residing overseas and could be contacted.

Promising to work together with the unfortunate home owner, in an email to KPRC, a representative wrote:

'There were a number of factors that contributed to the issues that resulted in the actions that we took on Mr. Gana’s mortgage and property.

'We continue to research the incidents.

'We have contacted Mr. Gana and we will work with him directly to address his concerns.'

But this isn't the first case of misdiagnosed mortgages by the banking giant.

A senior couple in Florida faced foreclosure earlier this summer after paying their mortgage one month too early and then using the wrong routing number in their following payment.

Sharon Bullington, 70, said the bank contacted her to say her and her husband had been cut out of their trial mortgage plan because of improper payments.

Instead of filing it the 'month in which it [was] due' in January, Mrs Bullington filed it in January, the bank penalized.

A second couple in Houston, Texas, was also under fear of foreclosure by the bank.

Brian and Khanklink Pyron were warned of their home's imminent loss, despite saying they had been current on their mortgage payments because of a technicality on the transfer of their home's title. 

The cause was a bankrupt company involved in their home's purchase, that never notified the family, despite their continuing payments to Bank of America which never reached their mortgage-holder.

'We did everything we were supposed to do,' Mr Pyron told MyFoxHouston.

'Nobody has communicated with us, notified us.

'We had been paying our mortgage 
and everything,' he asserted.
