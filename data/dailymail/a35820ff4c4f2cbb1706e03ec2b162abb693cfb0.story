Accused: Alex Hope is accused of posing as a City trader and using his investors' money to buy popstar Rihanna Cristal Champagne

A catering manager accused of posing as a City whizzkid used his investors money to buy singer Rihanna Cristal champagne as part of his £65,000 bar tab at a Mayfair nightclub, a court heard.

Alex Hope, 25, allegedly used the cash 
to treat the Umbrella singer to a three-litre bottle of bubbly, 
worth £4,500, after securing a table next to the star when she performed at the venue.

Southwark Crown Court heard that Hope used punters’ funds as his 
‘personal piggy bank’ and blew £125,000 on a single Nebuchadnezzar 
15-litre bottle of champagne during another night out.

He then allegedly frittered away almost 
£1m in casinos and racked up bar bills of £500,000 at exclusive 
nightclubs in London and Dubai after reinventing himself as a Forex 
trader.

The ‘City high flier’ was in reality a former catering manager at Wembley Stadium and used to flip burgers for a living.

Jurors heard that after blowing money on his lavish nightlife Hope would repay investors in his fraudulent Forex scheme with cash from new punters.

He allegedly got through £2million in the 13 months before his arrest in early 2012 when City of London police raided his flat in east London’s Docklands.

Jurors were told that Hope demanded a table next to Rihanna after she performed at Aura, a members only nightclub in London’s Mayfair that charges a minimum table spend of £800.

He then treated the 26-year-old singer to a Jeroboam bottle of Cristal following her set at the exclusive venue on February 26, 2012.

Nightclub owner Alberto Barberini told the jury: ‘It was a Sunday night which was quite a popular night, not many clubs like ours open on a Sunday.

‘We had a famous singer in the club at the time, it was Rihanna, she was performing but we hadn’t advertised it, it was a late notice thing.

‘I sent out a tweet about it. Then on the night Alex Hope arrived and said he wanted a table next to her, if possible.

‘I said at that time there wasn’t one but the table next to Rihanna was people that we knew so we just asked them to join another table - so we made it happen.

‘We knew Alex was a good customer and he would enjoy that so we got him a close table to her’.

Mr Barberini added Hope then bought Rihanna the bottle of Cristal as part of a £65,113 bar tab.

The court heard that he waived Hope’s £550 membership fee on the advice of event concierge Mo Samba, who regularly introduced celebs and footballers to his nightclub.

‘The first time I met Alex he came to the club and he had two or three friends with him, he asked if a table was available’, Mr Barberini said.

‘We didn’t have a table at that time, I told him the minimum spend was £800, he told me it wasn’t a problem.

‘While that conversation was ongoing I got a call from Mo Samba, he said “somebody’s coming to the club, we’ve sent him over, he’s a good customer, do what you can for him”’.

‘I heard he was in the finance business, a young hotshot doing very well for himself.

Venue:urors were told Hope once splurged £25,000 on a single Methuselah six-litre size bottle of Ace of Spades at Aura (pictured) and paid a third of his £41,330 bar bill by cash

‘I took him and Mo Samba out for dinner as a thank you and later got Alex into a nightclub in Dubai’.

Tom Baker, prosecuting, told jurors that Hope first partied at Aura on November 9, 2011, the night he won £4,000 on the tables at Palm Beach casino.

He added Hope then lost £10,000 at the same Mayfair casino the very next night. 

Jurors were told Hope once splurged £25,000 on a single Methuselah six-litre size bottle of Ace of Spades at Aura and paid a third of his £41,330 bar bill by cash.

However, Deborah Morris, defending, said Hope would not drink the luxury alcohol he had bought for friends but would instead sip cranberry juice, his favourite drink.

She added that Hope would often party at Aura with ‘fit, athletic black guys’ such as former Arsenal footballer Jo Kuffour, who currently plays for League Two side Wycombe Wanderers. 

Hope is charged alongside Raj Von Badlo, 56, for his involvement in the unauthorised investment scheme.

He is alleged to have withdrawn £95,000 in criminal proceeds and acted as the ‘promoter’ for the fraud.

Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denies one charge of fraud.

He has admitted violating City rules by carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised.

Von Badlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, denies concealing £95,000 in criminal property, carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised and two counts of making misleading statements.

The trial continues.
