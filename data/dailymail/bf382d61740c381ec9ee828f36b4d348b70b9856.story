Suspicions are growing about what role the wife of Justin Ross Harris may have played in the death of their 22-month-old son Cooper in the wake of her husband’s preliminary hearing on Thursday.

Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but a growing number of questions are being asked about her unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a sweltering SUV last month.

Harris, a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout Thursday’s hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away.

As prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly ahead.

During Thursday’s proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious.

When informed by workers at her son’s day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s testimony.

Then, when reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard.

When she called home June 18 with the grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’

Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’

Police had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling officers it was her ‘worst fear.’

At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him.

‘Ross is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’

Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions.

‘Some of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the same question,’ the deeply religious mother said.

‘I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.'

The 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, even if she could.

‘He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.’

On Thursday, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said the investigation continues and ‘much work remains.’

Many observers believe the police will be looking at Leanna Harris’ possible words and actions very closely.

Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head

Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18

Justin Ross Harris was denied bond on Thursday by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.'

He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness.

In
 Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against
 her husband, doesn’t apply in cases of the death of a child.

‘She needs to make a deal before the state finds more evidence against her,’ criminal defense lawyer Esther Panitch told AJC.com.

Thursday's preliminary hearing also featured disturbing
 new details suggesting that 22-month-old Cooper may have tried to free himself before succumbing to the 
heat.

Detective Stoddard told the court that several injuries were found on the toddler’s body, including visible marks on his face.

'It would have come from the child or a scratch being made while the child was alive and then not healing or scabbing over or anything after that, soon after he passed away,' said the officer.

There were also abrasions to the back 
of Cooper's head suggesting that the toddler was rubbing his head 
against the car seat in a desperate bid to get free.

The
 details that emerged from Stoddard's testimony paint a harrowing 
picture of Cooper's final moments, which the little boy possibly spent 
scratching his face with his nails and squirming to escape from the car 
seat. 

Arrest warrants 
released on Thursday shed additional light on what Cooper Harris must have 
been going through inside his father's scorching SUV.

According
 to the documents, the boy’s car seat was set on the lowest level, which
 means that Cooper was strapped in as tightly as possible.

Justin
 Harris allegedly knew the specific make and model of the car seat and 
what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it, the warrant 
revealed.

Leanna Harris listened intently to the evidence against her husband being presented by the prosecution and was later escorted to a waiting car after Justin Harris was denied bond

New documents released on Friday showed that Justin Harris had given his family grim instruction on what
 they'd have to do to collect on an insurance policy on the boy's life 
from his cell.

'Through the 
investigation Harris has made comments to family members regarding a 
life insurance policy that he has on Cooper and what they need to do in 
order to file for it,' the paper reported.

A Cobb County detective said there were two life insurance policies on the boy's life: one for $25,000 and one for $2,000. It's uncertain whether the family has actually attempted to claim the money.

Stoddard described the evidence police 
have suggesting Harris, who is charged with murder, killed his 
22-month-old son Cooper intentionally.

Leanna Harris also told police the pair were having intimacy issues, according to 
Stoddard. There are texts to indicate that she knew he was cheating on 
her.

'We plan to show that he wanted to live a child-free life,' the prosecution told the judge.

Stoddard
 testified that before the boy died, Harris had visited the website 
Reddit to search for articles on life without children, and viewed 
videos on Reddit that showed people dying - by suicide or execution, in 
some cases.

Harris had also twice viewed a video that shows the painful death of animals left in hot cars, and had searched for 'how to survive in prison', according to searches of his laptop, Stoddard said.

‘I think the evidence now is 
showing intent,’ Stoddard said.

He said Harris should remain in jail 
because he is a flight risk: There is evidence he was leading a double 
life, he has family in Alabama, and the former 911 dispatcher has law 
enforcement experience.

Defense attorney Maddox Kilgore said that evidence had no bearing on Harris' intent.

'I think the real purpose of all that is to publicly shame him,' Kilgore said

Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot. He sat impassively in an orange jail jumpsuit during Thursday's hearing.

Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look'
