Detective Hercule Poirot is set to make a triumphant return in a new thriller - almost four decades after he last featured in an Agatha Christie novel.

The Monogram Murders is to be written by poet and crime novelist Sophie Hannah and is set for release on September 8.

The publication comes almost 39 years after the last Poirot novel Curtain - which was published in September 1975.

Hercule Poirot, pictured here played by actor David Suchet, will return in a new thriller novel called The Monogram Murders. It will be written by crime novelist Sophie Hannah and published on September 8

Hugh Fraser, David Suchet and Philip Jackson star in The Mysterious Affair At Styles - published by Christie in 1920. The prolific author's family have backed the latest novel - which will be released in 29 languages

The detective, who was famous for his reliance on his 'the little grey cells' for solving crimes, was  killed off in the book - but Ms Hannah is said to be avoiding this creative set-back by setting her story early in Poirot's career.

The Monogram Murders will be told from the perspective of a new character - a policeman - who knows Poirot and asks for his involvement in the case.

Other famous Christie characters will make cameo appearances in the book - which will be published in 29 languages in 50 countries.

The novelist has today said writing the book, which comes four decades after Agatha Christie's last novel Sleeping, was a great honour.

Novelist and Poirot fan Sophie Hannah (left) said writing the book was 'extraordinary'. Her novel Kind Of Cruel (right) was nominated for Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013

She added she had read scores of Chrisitie's previous works in preparation for the book.

Sophie Hannah said: 'As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, it has been an extraordinary experience revisiting all of her magnificent novels and creating a Poirot mystery of my own. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be part of this story.'

Ms Hannah says she was asked to write the book after a lunch with her editor - who knew Christie's publishers HarperCollins were taking on contemporary novelists to re-write other classic novels.

Born in Manchester, Ms Hannah lives in Cambridge with her husband and two children.

She was a Fellow Commoner in Creative Arts at Trinity College, Cambridge between 1999 and 2001. She was also a junior research fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, before embarking on a career as a writer.

Although Ms Hannah has written scores of poems and children's books, she is best know for her eight crime novels - some of which have been adapted for television. Her 2008 novel The Point of Rescue was transformed into two-part drama Case Sensitive - shown on ITV.

Her novel Kind of Cruel was shortlisted for the Specsavers National Book Awards Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013.

She is also expected to publish another novel this year calling The Telling Error.

In an interview with the Western Daily Press, she said: 'My agent knew that HarperCollins was Agatha Christie's publisher and suggested that if they were doing that sort of thing, they should get Sophie Hannah to write an Agatha Christie novel'.

Ms Hannah then met with the author's family - who have since backed the project.

Speaking about meeting Christie's family, she said: 'Well, actually when I met them, I didn't think it was going to happen, so I wasn't that daunted.

'I felt daunted when they liked it and thought, "Yikes! Now I actually have to do this!"'

Christie's grandson Matthew Prichard said: 'Agatha Christie would have been really honoured at the thought of so many people around the world enjoying a new Poirot story and I am certain that all those who read Sophie Hannah’s novel will be reminded of the ingenious character my grandmother created.'

Hilary Strong, MD, Acorn Productions, which manages the rights to the Agatha Christie estate added: 'As we continue to build the Christie brand globally we are delighted to be working with HarperCollins and our publishing partners around the world to make this a truly memorable publishing event.'

Belgium Poirot is one of the most famous literary detectives in history - appearing in 33 novels, over 50 short stories and two plays between 1920 and 1975.

He is also one of Christie's most famous and loved characters - appearing in numerous screen adaptations, portrayed by several well-respected actors.

David Suchet is perhaps the most famous example - playing the detective in television series Agatha Christie's Poirot between 1989 and 2013.

Her 2008 novel The Point of Rescue, for example, was transformed into two-part drama Case Sensitive - shown on ITV.

Her novel Kind of Cruel was shortlisted for the Specsavers National Book Awards Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013.

Fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot was created by Agatha Christie, making his first appearance in novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles - published in 1920.

He made his exit in Curtain, published in 1975, dying from heart complications. His passing saw him gain an obituary on the front page of the New York Times.

Between 1920 and 1975, he appeared in 33 novels, 50 short stories and two plays named Black Coffee and Alibi. The character has been adapted from film, television and radio and has been played by scores of actors - including Tony Randall, David Suchet and John Moffatt.

The first actor to portray the detective was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the play Alibi. It was an adaptation by Michael Morton from the novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Austin Trevor played the character in the screen production of the show a few years later.

David Suchet is quite possibly the most famous Poirot, starring in the ITV series from 1989 to June 2013 - when he said he was leaving the role. Aptly, his last appearance was in an adaptation of final novel Curtain: Poirot's Last Case. It aired on 13 November 2013.

In An Autobiography, Christie sites Arthur Conan Doyle as a major inspiration, saying: 'I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition – eccentric detective, stooge assistant.

Christie is said to have not particularly enjoyed writing the character. In 1930, she said she found Poirot 'insufferable'.

OTHER NOVELS WRITTEN AFTER THE DEATH OF THE AUTHOR

Poirot is not the only character to be reborn following an author's death.

Famously, scores of James Bond novels have been written following the death of Ian Fleming - including John Gardner's Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. The author wrote 16 Bond novels following the original author's death in 1964.

Contemporary novelist Sebastian Faulks was commissioned to write a new Bond novel to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. Devil May Care was published by Penguin Books and was released on 28 May 2008

Solo, written by William Boyd was published in 2013.

Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes featured in four novels and 56 short stories - but the character has also been adapted for screen, television and radio on scores of occasions since.
