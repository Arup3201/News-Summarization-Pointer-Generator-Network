David Cameron already has a reputation for being the chillaxing Prime Minister.

Now it has emerged he has shunned formal meetings about the details of policy, to instead summon advisers for a ‘chaterama’.

Mr Cameron has taken to using the bizarre phrase with aides in Downing Street, in the latest signs of his relaxed approach to running the country.

David Cameron has taken to using the bizarre phrase 'chaterama' with aides in Downing Street, in the latest signs of his relaxed approach to running the country.

Friends – and enemies – have long noted Mr Cameron’s ability to rise above the political fray.

An ally once told the PM’s biographers: "If there was an Olympic gold medal for 'chillaxing', he would win it.’

He was hailed for being ‘capable of switching off in a way that almost no other politician I know of can’.

Just last week Mr Cameron revealed how he finds time to watch House of Cards, Wolf Hall, Game of Thrones and Disney film Frozen.

But it seems his relaxed approach even extends to meetings in which officials expect to focus on the minutiae of government reforms.

The Prime Minister recently summoned a special adviser for a briefing in Number 10, according to The Times.

The adviser turned up for the meeting with a ‘hefty pile of papers’ in preparation for difficult questions from Mr Cameron.

But as the meeting began, Mr Cameron leant back in his chair and declared: "Now, I just want a chaterama about this."

The briefing papers went undisturbed as the Prime Minister enjoyed the casual chat.

With less than three months to go until the general election, there is little new legislation going through the Commons.

Most MPs spend barely two full days a week in Westminster, with the rest of the time campaigning in their constituencies.

In an interview with MailOnline last week, Mr Cameron revealed what he hopes his legacy as Prime Minister would be. 'The one thing that matters most to me is securing our economy,’ he said.

'I think this government has done lots of important things, but the most important this is getting the country back on track, growth jobs, living within our means. That's what it's about.'

He also revealed he likes both House of Cards and Game of Thrones, adding: ‘Thrones more than Cards. I’m a big Thrones man.'

He prefers Wolf Hall to Downton Abbey, and finds Gogglebox ‘extraordinarily insightful’.

He admitted that even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen.

Asked if he is a Frozen fan, he replies wearily: 'I have no choice.' His youngest daughter Florence, aged four, 'of course is Elsa', he says.

His security detail also have to put up with the songs on loop when travelling with the family.
