You'll need to be free on Friday morning and have use of a webcam... We look forward to meeting you.

MailOnline Sport last week launched a mini-series of Football Friday Google+ Hangouts with Neil Ashton leading the debate as the Barclays Premier League reaches its thrilling climax.

This Friday Sportsmail's Martin Keown and Ian Ladyman are previewing the FA Cup final plus they'll bring you their insight on Fergie's decision to quit his post at Manchester United.

Manchester City take on Wigan on Saturday at the home of football with the deposed champions going for a sixth FA Cup.

Relegation-threatened Wigan are playing in their first final.

It's an intriguing match up and Keown, who has won the famous competition at both Wembley and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, is supremely-placed to lead the debate.

What's it like to play in the FA Cup final? What does victory taste like? Does that feeling change when you lift the trophy on multiple occasions?

This is your chance to tap into Martin's wealth of experience.

And let's not forget his tactical expertise...

Do Wigan stand a chance? Or will Roberto Mancini's side misjudge their challengers?

In the January of 2002 I was despatched from London to Manchester to cover the final few months of Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign at Manchester United. Little did anybody know back then that I – like everybody else – would have to wait more than a decade to do it.

Click here to read IAN LADYMAN'S full account of his 10 years with Sir Alex.... And don't forget to join him in the Hangout on Friday at 11am.

Whatever you think of Callum McManaman and THAT tackle against Newcastle, he's a potent threat on Wigan's wing. Will City care?

Oh, and we'll be joined by the trophy itself as we come live from Wembley.

And Sir Alex called time on his 27-year 
reign at Old Trafford on Wednesday morning and will bow out after the 
club's final game of the season against West Bromwich.

What does the future hold for the club in the wake of Fergie's departure? How do you feel about Everton boss David Moyes possibly taking the reins?

What of Wayne Rooney's decision to ask for a transfer? And the sensational news that Ronaldo could be on his way back?

There's plenty to talk about.
