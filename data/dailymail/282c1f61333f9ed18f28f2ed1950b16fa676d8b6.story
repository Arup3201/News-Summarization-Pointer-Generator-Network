A 23-year-old legislative intern in Florida - who had hopes of going to law school next year - has been missing for over a week, and authorities are running short on credible leads in their effort to find him.

Ryan Uhre, an intern in the Tallahassee office of state Representative Richard Stark, was last seen on February 2 - which was Super Bowl Sunday - at a bar just blocks from the Florida State Capitol.

Sunday also was the last time he responded to text messages or phone calls from his family.

Missing: Ryan Uhre - a 23-year-old legislative intern in Florida - has been missing since Super Bowl sunday

Vanished: Uhre was last seen leaving a bar in Tallahassee on February 2, and has not been heard from since

'We're just still baffled why in one week we havenâ€™t heard a word from him,' his father, Michael Uhre, told NBCMiami.

The night he disappeared, Uhre was at a bar in Tallahassee called Clyde & Costello's. Credit card records also indicate that he went to another nearby bar called Andrews Capital Grill and Bar.

He was last seen wearing a white, Hawaiian-style t-shirt with surfing Santas on it. 

Different leads have taken law enforcement officials all across the state looking for Uhre after cell phone records showed that Uhre's cell phone had briefly been turned on and then quickly turned off near Pompano Beach in Fort Lauderdale - which is nearly 500 miles from Tallahassee - on Thursday. Uhre went to high school near Fort Lauderdale.

Family members tell the Miami Herald that authorities also were investigating a possible sighting of Uhre and Rosie's Bar and Grill in the Wilton Manors section of Fort Lauderdale. Employees at the restaurant, however, say they couldn't remember whether they saw the 23-year-old.

Uhre graduated from Florida State University in December and was planning on going to law school, his family says.

In the meantime, he was interning in Representative Stark's office, but had been there just a few days before his disappearance.

'In the few days that Ryan has worked with us, he demonstrated 
exemplary knowledge and performance in all of his tasks,' Stark - who knows Uhre's father - said in a statement. 'My thoughts and prayers are with Ryan and his family, and I 
sincerely hope that his disappearance will have a positive outcome.'

At the moment, authorities don't suspect Uhre's disappearance is the result of foul play.

Anyone with information about Uhre's whereabouts is asked to call the Tallahassee Police Department at 850-606-5800.
