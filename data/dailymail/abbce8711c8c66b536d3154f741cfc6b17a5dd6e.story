A nationwide manhunt has been launched after a man who tried to break up a fight on a dancefloor was left with a five-inch gash across his face that needed fifty stitches.

Ben Selby, 30, stepped in to try and stop a man and a woman fighting in a nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset, but he was attacked.

Mr Selby spotted the man cut the woman's arm with a knife during the argument and ran over to help but slipped and fell at the feet of the attacker.

The man then sliced Mr Selby's face from his eye down to below his chin with the blade.

Police have launched a national search for 27-year-old Jiger Sadeq, thought to be responsible for the attack in the V Club.

Sadeq has a tattoo on his left hand and is believed to live in Bournemouth although he is originally from Iraq.

His photograph has now been posted on the Crimewatch website, where he is described as 'dangerous'.

Wounded: Ben Selby slipped over as he tried to attack the knifeman and had his face slashed

Mr Selby, from Bournemouth, said: 'I got involved because I saw a guy pull out a knife and slice a woman across the arm following an argument.

'I tried to help, but stumbled and fell on my knees, and that's when he slashed me across the face.'

Two of his friends, including a young woman, also suffered knife wounds during the attack in February this year.

The nightclub had its licence suspended following the incident, and has reopened under new owners and is now called Halo.

A spokesman from Dorset Police said an investigation into the incident was ongoing.
