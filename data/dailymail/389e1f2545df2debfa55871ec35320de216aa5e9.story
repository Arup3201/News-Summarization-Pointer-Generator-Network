Five years to the day since his arrest in Cuba on espionage charges, Alan Gross' wife has declared that the former U.S. government subcontractor  is 'done for'.

'I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,' Judy Gross said in a statement, adding that her 65-year-old husband now appears gaunt, hobbling and missing five teeth.

Cuba arrested the Washington D.C. resident on December 3, 2009, and later convicted him to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine internet service for Cuban Jews.

Gross' fate now largely hinges on Obama trying to improve ties between Cuba and the U.S.

'It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late,' his wife urged this week.

In light of Gross' five-year anniversary behind bars, the White House called on Cuba for his release, with press secretary Josh Earnest saying in a press release that the U.S. remains 'deeply concerned' about the American's health.

Earnest said Gross' release 'would remove an impediment to more constructive relations' between the two countries. 

The case is emblematic of bitter U.S.-Cuban relations dating to the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, and any potential breakthrough appears remote while Gross is still in prison. 

As he recently did on immigration, Obama could move without congressional approval to relax U.S. rules that require most Americans wanting to visit Cuba to go on expensive, organized trips with U.S.-approved agendas. 

Such a change could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for Cuba's centrally planned economy, which is struggling for cash in the absence of major expansions in foreign investment or private economic activity. 

Cuban authorities this week sharply downgraded their prediction of 2014 growth to 1.3 per cent, nearly a point lower than expected at the beginning of the year.

Observers in both countries warn, however, that expectations of imminent progress have come and gone before without real change to relations that have been tense for more than five decades.

'We won't make enough progress obviously until he's home,' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said of Gross on Tuesday. 

'His continued incarceration represents a significant impediment to a more constructive bilateral relationship.'

Gross' wife, Judy, said in a written statement that the contractor has lost more than 100 pounds, can barely walk due to chronic pain, and has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye. 

The married father-of-one has begun refusing to see his family and members of Cuba's small Jewish community, who had been visiting him on religious holidays.

Backers in the U.S. said Gross has begun discussing a hunger strike, a tactic he has used in the past.

'He hasn't been seeing anyone for a while,' said David Prinstein, vice president of the Havana-based Jewish community association. 

Prinstein said he hoped Gross would accept a visit for Hannukah celebrations this month.

'We maintain our hope that he will see us and keep his Jewish faith alive, and his faith that maybe this coming year he can return to his country,' Prinstein said.
