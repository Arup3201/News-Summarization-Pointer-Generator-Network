A nursery nurse accused of manslaughter has broken down after reliving the moment she had to untangle a lifeless three-year-old girl from a rope attached to a slide.

Lydia Bishop died on September 17, 2012, after she was found hanging from the slide at York College nursery.

Nursery worker Sophee Redhead, 25, is standing trial for Lydia’s manslaughter by gross negligence at Leeds Crown Court.

Prosecutor Robert Smith QC has claimed Redhead saw the little girl walk towards the slide - but left Lydia 'to her own devices' for up to 20 minutes.

Giving evidence at court on Wednesday, Redhead’s voice broke as she recounted how she had to untangle Lydia from the rope and ran back into the nursery building with the lifeless child in her arms.

She told how she realised something was terribly wrong when she saw Lydia, who was on her first day at the nursery, on the slide looking 'pale'.

Incident: Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard

She said she pushed her and shouted her name, but getting no response she ran with her and trend to give her CPR.

The court heard the 25 year-old mother-of-one, whose three-year-old also went to the nursery when she worked there from Monday to Wednesday, had initially spoken to a police officer and a doctor saying she had seen Lydia on the slide.

But
 yesterday the experienced nursery nurse maintained she could not 
remember any of these conversations - and that, in actual fact, she did 
not see Lydia go anywhere near the slide.

Her
 barrister, Alistair MacDonald QC, put the sequence of events to her, in
 which it was revealed she and another nursery nurse were supervising 
children who were playing outside in the sandpit and with wooden 
building bricks, but a 'makeshift barrier' of a bench and a toy trolley 
were put in place to stop the children from going to the area near the slide.

The trial continues.
