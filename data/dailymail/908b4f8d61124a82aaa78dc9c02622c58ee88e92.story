Outward bound: Simon Kneen will depart Banana Republic at the end of the year, following a five-year tenure

Mass retailer Banana Republic has announced that its creative director, Simon Kneen, is leaving the brand following a five-year tenure.

Kneen, who is best known for bringing designer collaborations into the Banana Republic fold, will make his official departure at the end of the year.

The brand says that it has already begun the search for Kneen’s replacement.

In a statement issued on Gap Inc.’s  
corporate website, Jack Calhoun, Banana Republic’s global brand 
president said: ‘In the last five years with the brand, Simon has led 
with passion, creativity, and a thoughtful approach to designing modern 
and versatile styles for professional men and women.’

He
added: ‘As we compete to win on the global stage, now is the right time
to make a change,’ implying that Kneen’s departure had been 
premeditated to make room for a new era at the brand.

Banana
Republic serves as Gap’s professional ware counterpart. It offers 
dressier alternatives to Gap’s casual separates and Old Navy’s (also 
owned by the company) bargain-priced basics.

In
the 90s Banana Republic hit its stride with polished, well-made attire.
More recently, it seems like its merchandise's quality and designs have been heavily downgraded.

Last year, Banana Republic contracted 
renowned designer Narciso Rodriguez in an advisory position to work 
alongside Kneen and help the retailer ‘rev up its fashion offering,’ 
writes WWD. The first of Rodriguez’s joint efforts for the brand landed 
on store shelves for fall, displaying cleaner lines (true to Rodriguez 
form) and higher minded fashion.

Representatives
for Gap say that Rodriguez’s contract has come to an end and they are 
now looking for a replacement for him as well.

New vision: Banana Republic, a global retailer owned by Gap, is searching for a replacement for both Kneen and creative advisor Narciso Rodriguez whose revamped ideas for the brand hit stores this fall (shown in the windows above)

In his five-year run as creative director Kneen introduced collaborations to Banana Republic’s customers. He arranged partnerships with Trina Turk, Milly, and Issa. Kneen also tapped into Hollywood as well: he steered a Banana Republic collaboration with the 2012 Anna Karenina film, as well as an ongoing partnership with Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant, which was perhaps the most successful of his tenure’s efforts.

Banana Republic’s L’Wren Scott collaboration will bow this December. Kneen’s last collection for the retailer will hit stores for summer 2014.
