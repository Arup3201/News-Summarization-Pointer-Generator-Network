Little girls do, in general, grow out of their obsessions with dolls. But Orit Fox never did. The 34-year-old Israeli model's ambition is to turn herself into a lifesize plastic Barbie doll using cosmetic surgery and hold off ageing at the same time.

To do it, she has her plastic surgeon on call 24 hours a day and visits whenever she spots a wrinkle or is feeling less than happy about her looks.

'I like beauty,' she explains. 'Visually, I look like Barbie, like a doll. Men love my body. It's like a dream, a fantasy.'

Glamour girl: Orit Fox says she loves looking like a Barbie and has plastic surgeon Dr Klein on call at all times

Orit, who is hugely famous in her home country, gained global notoriety in 2012 when a video of her being bitten on the breast by an angry snake during a photo shoot went viral.

Rumours that the snake had died thanks to its silicone-filled snack followed, but according to Orit, the reptile is still alive and none the worse for its 15 minutes of fame.

'It was so funny and amazing,' she chortles of her Youtube superstardom. 'The snake bit me on the breast and now the whole country talks about my breast!

'There was a rumour that the silicone killed the snake,' she adds, 'but he survives. It didn't do damage. It's like a cat scratch. It was one month I had scars from the snake.'

Despite the best efforts of the snake, Orit says she has no plans to wind down her career - or her plans for more surgery.

'I cannot stop this obsession to my beauty,' she insists. 'It's not healthy, it's unhealthy. Four times I do surgery to my breasts. I do silicone in the face...

Painful: Orit visits her plastic surgeon Dr Klein whenever she spots a wrinkle or something she doesn't like

'Sometimes I feel an empty spot in my face and I fill with silicone. My teeth... I ask for the most white they have.

'I think I'm more beautiful now because I keep my beauty. It's very important to keep my beauty.'

Appearing in Channel 5 documentary, 200 Nips and Tucks and I Want More, she's seen visiting her surgeon Dr Klein - the man responsible for her unique look.

'If I have a bad day, I run to Dr Klein to see if he can do me something to make me happy,' she explains. 'If I feel sad, I feel ugly. It's in my head.'

'Whenever she spot a wrinkle in the mirror, she is coming,' adds Dr Klein. 'She doesn't want wrinkles, she hate wrinkles, so we do everything so she is happy.'

Despite the painful nature of most of the procedures, Orit says she's willing to put up with just about anything to keep her looks.

Plans for the future: Orit hopes that she will look as good as Sophia Loren when she finally gets old

'Pain for my beauty, I accept,' she claims. 'He [Dr Klein] do a great job, it's like an art.'

'She doesn't want to be old,' adds Dr Klein. ;She want to be young, forever young. So we treat it, little by little. She is not addicted, she doesn't have too much. She just wants to be young.'

So what does Orit think she'll look like when she really is old? According to the model, looking like Sophia Loren in the plan.

'Look at Sophia Loren,' she exclaims. 'She's beautiful. She keeps her beauty. I am high maintenance like a ferrari, a lamborghini. I have to take care of myself so I can be pretty on the road.'
