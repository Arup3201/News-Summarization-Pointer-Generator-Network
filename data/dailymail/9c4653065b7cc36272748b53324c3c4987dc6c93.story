Louis van Gaal will walk straight into a Europa League headache if Manchester United finish sixth in the Premier League on Sunday.

United will not cancel a lucrative pre-season tour of the United States if they do qualify for Europe - leaving their new manager the task of picking two different United teams to play in different continents at the same time.

Next step: Louis van Gaal's appointment as United boss is expected to be confirmed in the next few days

July 29 (v Inter Milan): De Gea; Rafael, Jones, Smalling, Evra; Young, Carrick, Fellaini, Mata; Rooney, van Persie

July 31 (Europa League): Lindegaard; Varela, Keane, Evans, Buttner; Zaha, Fletcher, Cleverley, Kagawa; Welbeck, Hernandez

United are currently seventh in the table but will move up a place if they win at Southampton and Spurs lose at home to Aston Villa.

The sixth-placed team will be required to enter the Europa  League at the third qualifying round stage and the first leg will have to be played on July 31 – less than 48 hours after United are due to meet Inter Milan in the American capital Washington DC. 

It leaves van Gaal, whose appointment is expected to be confirmed in the next few days, the conundrum of picking one team for a prestigious US tour, and another good enough to ensure they can progress in the Europa League.

To add to the complication, United's players who get to the latter stages of the World Cup which ends on July 13 will still be on holiday. United will play at least four games in America this summer in the International Champions Cup between July 23 and August 4.  The second leg of the Europa League tie would be on August 7.

No player is likely to be asked to play in both competitions but it does raise the possibility of van Gaal jetting from Washington straight to wherever United's European game is.

Positive: Interim boss Ryan Giggs is determined his side should try and win at Southampton

Despite the logistical problems, interim manager Giggs is determined his side should try and give it their all to win at Southampton on Sunday even though Wayne Rooney is still unavailable after only recently returning to training from a groin injury.

'It is a consideration with my team selection as I want to be in Europe. I think United should be in Europe. Obviously everyone wants to be in the Champions League but with the squad we have got it would be good if we were in Europe,' said Giggs.

'I don't think Liverpool (who have not  been in Europe this season) have the size of squad that we've got. I know from the last few weeks the selection problems you do have and that the manager will have next season if there is only one game a week.

'It could be beneficial if we were in the competition. It could bring on players or give people games where they need it. 'I played in Europe at 17 and 18 and it helped me as it was a different experience. It definitely brings you along quicker.'

Dilemma: Man United are expected to take stars like Robin van Persie on America tour

The tour is also vitally important to United with managing-director Richard Arnold announcing it to great hype in February.

United will warm up against MLS side LA Galaxy in Los Angeles on July 23 and then play in the International Champions Cup against Roma on July 26 in Denver, Inter and Real Madrid in Ann Arbor, Michigan on August 2.

The top-placed team will meet the winners of the other group featuring Liverpool, Manchester City, Olympiacos and AC Milan.

The American hosts will expect United's big guns to go on tour leaving van Gaal to pick a shadow side for Europe. United have already held internal talks about how to be competitive for both games.
