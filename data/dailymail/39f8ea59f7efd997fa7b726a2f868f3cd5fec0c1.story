The wife of Olympic ski champ Bode Miller is showing off her baby bump in a new photo.

Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player and model, shared a snap of her growing belly on Instagram as the two enjoy a tropical vacation.

The pair confirmed just last week that Beck was pregnant, making this the third child for Miller and the first for Beck.

Mom to be: Morgan Beck (above) showed of her baby bump just days after she and husband Bode Miler announced they were expecting

Showing: In a photo of the couple posted over Thanksgiving (above), Beck's little bump can be seen

A look back at a photo of the couple over Thanksgiving also shows Beck with a tiny baby bump.

This after Beck implied that Sara McKenna, the mother to Miller's 22-month-old son, got pregnant by fishing one of the skier's condoms out of the trash and inseminating herself.

'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com.

After users became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed. 

McKenna and Miller have been involved in litigation over custody of their since his birth, with the case just now being settled, though details have not been made public.

Even more strange is the fact that McKenna named the boy Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, though Miller has named him Nathaniel.

Miller, 37, chose that name to honor his brother who died of a seizure at the age of 29 in 2013.

McKenna has also dismissed Beck's claims about how she got pregnant, saying; 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida. This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.'

Miller and Beck, who met in 2012 just months after he began dating McKenna, were married in October 2012.

Early in 2013 Beck, 27, suffered a miscarriage while pregnant with a child, just one month before McKenna gave birth. 

Miller's other child is daughter Neesyn, who he had with his ex Chanel Johnson and was born in 2008.

Miller has named her Dacey.
