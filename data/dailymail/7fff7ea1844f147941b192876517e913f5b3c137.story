David Cameron is set to hold crisis talks with Barack Obama and other world leaders over the Ebola outbreak.

The Prime Minister will hold talks with the US President, as well as the leaders of Germany, France and Italy, during a conference call this afternoon about international efforts to counter the virus.

It came after Mr Cameron pledged that the Government would do ‘everything we can to keep this country safe’ from the outbreak of deadly virus.

The discussion comes as it was revealed that a second US health care worker had tested positive for the illness, which has already claimed almost 4,500 lives, mainly in west Africa.

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron stressed there were no direct flights from the affected areas, though screening processes beginning at Heathrow Airport were being rolled out.

He told MPs: ‘There'll be another Cobra meeting chaired today by the Foreign Secretary, I'll be chairing one tomorrow.

‘We're looking at all these issues about where people are arriving to and co-operating properly with all the devolved authorities.'

The Prime Minister added: ‘It is worth stressing there are no direct flights from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea into the United Kingdom, so we're talking about people who come here indirectly, and that is why it's so important we put in place the screening processes starting at Heathrow but to be rolled out more as the days go by.

‘I'm absolutely convinced that we will do everything we can to keep this country safe. I will make sure that proper liaison not only with Northern Ireland but also with the Republic takes place.’

His comments came as DUP Parliamentary Group Leader Nigel Dodds urged the Prime Minister to liaise ‘very closely’ with Northern Ireland authorities on the issue of screening checks.

Mr Dodds said: ‘Given the very serious spread of the Ebola virus worldwide with reports that there could be up to 10,000 new cases per week by two months' time.

‘Will the Prime Minister as part of his meetings later today and in Cobra ensure that he liaises very, very closely with the authorities in Northern Ireland, given that we share a land frontier with another jurisdiction in relation to checks on people coming into the UK.

‘It's a very serious issue for Northern Ireland, it's a very serious issue potentially for the rest of the UK.’
