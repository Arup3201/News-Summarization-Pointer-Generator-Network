A 71-year-old woman who was stung and completely covered by a swarm of thousands of bees in Palm Desert this week is expected to recover

The attack occurred on Thursday after a Verizon employee stumbled across 75,000 to 80,000 Africanized honey bees in an underground on Lucerne Drive, inside a gated community.

The bees set upon the man before turning their wrath on the elderly woman.

Fire firefighters who attended the scene also needed to be hospitalized, according to The Press-Enterprise.

The victim is said to have been visiting relatives from out of state and walking from a car about 4.40pm.

She was unable to move quickly enough to escape the swarm.

Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Williams said family members threw a blanket over the woman and rushed her inside.

Lance Davis, owner of Lance Davis Killer Bee Live Removal in Palm Desert, said the victim was lucky to be alive.

'You couldn’t see her,' Davis said of the amount of bees.

'They’re quick to anger, and they are relentless in their attack.'

'If it takes the whole hive to protect against an intruder, or someone perceived to be an intruder, they will do it.'

Five firefighters- three who assisted the woman and two who tried to keep others away from the scene — were also hospitalized after being stung.

All returned to duty after treatment, officials said.

The woman is believed to have suffered 1,000 stings.

Davis said the bees were likely attracted to the underground vault because they were unlikely to be disturbed and because it was cool.

Bees also like attics and walls for those reasons, Davis said.

He removed the bees first by blowing smoke into the hive.

The smoke confuses the pheromones, a secreted chemical that sends a signal to other bees to attack en masse.

Davis was then able to vacuum up the bees.

He them took them to his hive in Thermal and later gave them to farmers for crop pollination.

Davis said anyone dealing with a similar situation should never try to kill or remove the bees themselves and to call in experts.
