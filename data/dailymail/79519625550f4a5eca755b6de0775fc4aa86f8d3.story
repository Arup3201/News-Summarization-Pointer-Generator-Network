The local station KRTK-TV reported that the school was placed on lockdown. Parents are being advised to stay away from the campus.

The
school began the process of evacuating students from the campus and 
taking them by buses to the nearby parking lot of Conn's department 
store, where many concerned family members have been waiting since this 
morning.  

Parents have expressed frustration with the school district, claiming that officials have not been forthcoming with information, and it took the school too long to send out notification about the emergency. 

Spring High School serves about 3,000 students. The campus is not equipped with metal detectors.

Police officers said that parents of students directly involved in the fight already had been notified, and others need not worry for their children’s safety.

Grief councillors have been dispatched to the school to speak to students who witnessed the bloody altercation.

It has been suggested that the incident started out as a possibly gang-related cafeteria brawl that got out of hand.

Click2Houston further reported that tensions have been simmering between members of rival gangs at the school for some time, and Wednesday’s deadly incident may have been in retaliation.

Details of the stabbing were scant, but one student posted what was believed to be a photo from inside the campus showing blood on the floor.

A mother who was dropping off her daughter at Spring High School told the station MyFox Houston that she heard commotion in the lunchroom, followed by an announcement over the PA system calling for a school nurse.

When she walked out into the hallway, the woman recounted seeing a trail of blood stretching from the cafeteria to the back of the building.
