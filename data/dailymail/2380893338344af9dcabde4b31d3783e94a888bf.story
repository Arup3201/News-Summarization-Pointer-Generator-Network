Loaded up with £400 of  alcohol they had shoplifted from a supermarket, Rose Devlin and Denise Egan jumped into their car to make their escape.

But the bungling thieves had forgotten the one thing every getaway vehicle needs – petrol.

Their Citroen was out of fuel and they roped in a passer-by to push it to the supermarket’s own petrol station.

With so much alcohol in the car, Devlin struggled to close the boot of the pair's getaway vehicle

Loaded up with £400 of  alcohol they had shoplifted from a supermarket, Rose Devlin and Denise Egan jumped into their car to make their escape.

But the bungling thieves had forgotten the one thing every getaway vehicle needs – petrol.

Their Citroen was out of fuel and they roped in a passer-by to push it to the supermarket’s own petrol station.

The two grandmothers then paid to fill up their car before driving off, unaware the whole fiasco had been caught on security camera.

Magistrates in Manchester heard how Devlin, 59, and Egan, 52, struck at the Asda store in Chadderton on June 6, loading a trolley with bottles of alcohol.

One of the women then distracted a security guard while the other pushed the trolley loaded with stolen goods to the car park.

After Egan refuelled the car, they paid for the petrol but their faces had been captured many times on CCTV cameras

Pictured outside court yesterday, Egan (left) admitted helping push the car to the petrol station and Devlin struggled to close the boot because there was so much alcohol in the back of the car

They had taken so much that  Devlin struggled  repeatedly to shut the boot.

When they later tried to repeat the stunt at another branch of the supermarket by loading £159.50 of goods into a trolley, they were caught, arrested and linked by the footage to the earlier crime.

Egan was given a conditional  discharge for two years and told to pay £280 compensation and £85 costs. Devlin will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on December 13.
