Christopher Taylor drowned after the emergency dispatcher missed the alert and the control room supervisor admitted he may have been distracted

A student drowned after paramedics and police were delayed when two 999 operators missed the emergency call, an inquest heard.

Christopher Taylor had been spotted desperately clinging onto a branch after falling into the River Avon in Bath last January.

A passerby called 999 but by the time emergency services reached the scene the sporty 21-year-old had disappeared in the freezing river.

The inquest heard there had been an unexplained  delay between the time of the call and when police officers and paramedics were sent to the scene.

An emergency dispatcher admitted she had missed the alert while the control room supervisor claimed he may have been distracted doing admin.

Christopher had been celebrating the end of his exams with friends when he fell into the river at 4am last January. 

An underwater search team retrieved his body from the River Avon in the centre of Bath, Somerset, downstream later that day.

Coroner Maria Voisin questioned why there had been the unexplained five minute delay.

The two control room staff responsible for dispatching officers said they did not know why they didn't respond straight away.

Supervising emergency officer dispatcher Pete Jennings said he did not see the emergency flashing on his screen as he may have been doing paperwork at the time.

He said: 'I really cannot explain it or recall what I was doing at the time.'

Emergency dispatcher Hayley Deacon added that she did not immediately see it on her computer screen because she may have been dealing with another incident.

She said: 'I really cannot recall what I was doing, and why I did not see the emergency light flashing.'

Talented Christopher, who was a keen tennis player, was studying Chemistry at the University of Bath when he went out in the city on January 23.

Just weeks before his death he had posted a Facebook message about having the 'best year ever' with his girlfriend Jessica Palmer, 20.

He wrote: 'Well, that’s 2013 done and dusted...and as gay as it sounds, I’ve had the best year ever with my Jessica Palmer...I love you.'

Chris also posted happy pictures of himself in a tuxedo with Jessica in front of a Christmas tree and more pictures of themselves on a weekend trip to Bristol. 

Passerby Luke Thompson had spotted Christopher, who was showing signs of hypothermia, desperately clinging on to the branch and dialled 999.

Mr Thompson told the inquest he was conscious and calling for help when he noticed the student.

He said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I heard someone calling from the river, he was calling for help.

'I immediately got off the phone and ran to where he was. I called 999 and tried to get closer.

'There was a huge drop of about 10 or 12 feet, and the victim was holding on to a branch or something to keep him up.

'I tried to keep him talking while we waited for the police to arrive.

'He told me he had fallen in the river and he desperately needed to get out.'

Mr Thompson told the inquest there were lots of trees and bushes where the student had fallen in, and it was impossible for him to get out.

By the time police and paramedics reached the scene Christopher - who was showing signs of hypothermia - had disappeared in the swollen river

He said the second year student was fighting for his life but as time passed he got weaker and his speech became slurred.

By the time police and paramedics arrived at the scene, Christopher had already gone under the water, Mr Thompson called the court.

Christopher's friend Matthew Learoyd (corr) said in a statement the group had a few drinks, but his friend was not a heavy drinker and was not very drunk.

A post mortem revealed the levels of alcohol found was not 'serious or severe', but could have affected co-ordination and slow down reaction.

At the time of his death, Christopher's grieving family, from Southport, Lancashire, paid tribute to him as 'a wonderful son and brother'.

In a statement they said: 'Chris was a talented sportsman who lit up every room he walked into.

'His death has left us completely devastated.'

Christopher was the fourth drowning in Bath in recent years. Last year, an 850-yard fence was installed along a stretch of the river to improve water safety.

The fencing was one of the recommendations of a safety review carried out following the tragedies.

The inquest at Flax Bourton, Somerset continues.
