Arsenal have beaten Liverpool to the signing of Finland Under 19 goalkeeper Hugo Keto.

The 18-year-old passed a medical this week and has signed a three-year deal with the Gunners.

Keto was a boyhood Liverpool fan and was on trial with the club last season.

The 6ft 3in goalkeeper also spent time with Arsenal and has chosen to sign for the London club.

Keto is expected to join the club's youth setup to begin with, although Arsene Wenger will hope he can provide competition for first choice goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny in time.
