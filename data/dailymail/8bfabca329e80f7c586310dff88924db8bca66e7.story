Whether you prefer a relaxing beach getaway or an action-packed holiday weekend, the cinema is a fantastic place to look for inspiration.

Films capture the soul of a massive city or the beauty of an idyllic beach paradise - from the booming metropolis of New York in When Harry Met Sally to the isolated wonder of The Beach's Thai setting - while telling stories that captivate us.

Travel website dealchecker.co.uk has published a list of places inspired by some of Hollywood's biggest blockbusters. 

Take inspiration from the famous musical Mamma Mia! and visit the small port town of Skopelos, Greece

Mamma Mia! - Skopelos, Greece 

Hollywood's most successful musical follows Sophie's search for her biological father on the tiny Greek island of Skopelos. The charming town, full of nooks and crannies to explore, is home to just under 5,000 individuals and exudes  romance - particularly set to a soundtrack of ABBA power ballads. Add to that crystal clear water and beautiful white-washed cottages and you have the perfect hidden hideaway.

New York, New York! The city that never sleeps was the setting for the 1989 classic, When Harry Met Sally

When Harry Met Sally - New York City

Really, who isn't a fan of this iconic rom-com? Starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, the flick follows the will-they-won't-they friendship between Harry and Sally over the span of 12 years and many chance encounters in the Big Apple.

Aside from hilariously heartwarming moments and sharp dialogue, the film also prominently features some of the city's most famous landmarks, such as Central Park and Katz's Delicatessen.

Channel your inner Leonardo DiCaprio and head to this remote beach on Thailand's Phi Phi islands

The Beach - Koh Phi Phi, Thailand 

A young Leonardo DiCaprio starred in this early 2000s backpacker adventure film set among the white-sand beaches of Thailand.

While the country is full of picture-perfect tropical islands to choose from, for a truly authentic experience head to the southern Phi Phi islands to catch a boat to the world's most recognisable beach. 

During Lost in Translation, viewers are treated to a cinematic tour of some of Tokyo's must-see spots

Lost in Translation - Tokyo

 An unlikely alliance forms between two strangers - a young woman and an older man - as the lonely pair bond exploring Japan's metropolitan centre.

As the two characters deal with their own fragmented relationships, viewers are taken on a tour of Tokyo's highlights: the shopping area of Shibuya, the red-light district of Kabukichō, and even the city's luxe Park Hyatt hotel.

Hawaii served as the lush backdrop of the film Forgetting Sarah Marshall

Forgetting Sarah Marshall - Oahu, Hawaii 

You can't help but root for Peter Bretter as he heads to Hawaii to win back his famous actress girlfriend, Sarah.

An all-star cast makes for high comedy moments and it's just that much funnier with the breath-taking Turtle Bay Resort in Oahu, Hawaii, in the background.

A little piece of paradise, the resort is located on the Island's North Shore, though Waikiki Beach is another popular Oahu destination for sunseekers looking for stunning beaches and stellar surfing.

If 2010's Eat Pray Love doesn't inspire you to jet off to Rome, nothing will

Eat Pray Love - Rome

 Now this is a true travel film.

Julia Roberts heads out on the adventure of a lifetime - a year spent discovering her spirituality in some of the world's most gorgeous locales.

While India and Bali are prominently featured, several of the film's most compelling scenes take place during her  four-month stint exploring Rome.

From the Pantheon to the Colosseum and all of the pizza and pasta in between, if this movie doesn't make you want to pack your bags and head to the Eternal City, we don't know what will.

Follow the adventures of unlucky-in-love Londoner, Bridget, in the laugh-out-loud comedy Bridget Jones's Diary

Bridget Jones's Diary - London

There's nothing like a viewing of the awkward adventures of unlucky-in-love Londoner Bridget Jones to make us appreciate the capital even more.

Bridget takes viewers insider her Southwark flat - above the traditional Globe pub - and the film also features views of almost every major London landmark, including Tower Bridge, Borough Market and the Royal Exchange buildings where (spoiler!) Mark and Bridget kiss in the snow.

For diehard Lord of the Rings fans, New Zealand offers two-week tours to visit all filming locations

The Lord of the Rings - New Zealand 

This action-adventure trilogy sure does do New Zealand's lush greenery, majestic mountains and picturesque winding rivers justice.

Discover the stunning scenery on your own or follow in Frodo's footsteps with a 14-day tour taking you to filming locations from one end of the country to the other. 

Disney's animated hit, Frozen, was inspired by the delightful port city of Bergen, Norway

Frozen - Bergen, Norway 

While this film isn't technically filmed in Norway (it's meant to be set in the imaginary Kingdom of Arendelle), Disney has confirmed that the animations are inspired by the charming city of Bergen, Norway.

A gorgeous harbour, timbered houses, and climbing hills are just the beginning when it comes to exploring Norway's busiest port.

From dance scenes to the Dharavi slums, Slumdog Millionaire offers a unique glimpse into Mumbai

Slumdog Millionaire - Mumbai

 India is portrayed in a very raw and beautiful way in this Academy Award-winning film.

From the slums of Dharavi to the masterpiece that is the Taj Mahal, we are treated to a rare glimpse into all aspects of the world's fifth most-populous city as we follow the characters' journeys.

The cultural and architectural hot spot is filled with incredible buildings to see, food to consume, and festivals, music, and cinema to experience.
