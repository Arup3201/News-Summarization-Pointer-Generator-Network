Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's support from voters has plummeted and he is now as unpopular as Julia Gillard ever was, a new poll has revealed just days after his government delivered a harsh first budget.

This comes as Mr Abbott launched a stunning riposte in defence of the budget on Sunday, saying 'selective hearing' from the electorate was to blame for any confusion over the cost-cutting package.

Labor has been boosted to a 12 percentage point lead over the Coalition in the two-party vote at 56/44, the monthly Fairfax-Nielsen nationwide phone poll showed on Monday.

Mr Abbott's negative rating has also hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number former Prime Minister Ms Gillard recorded at her most unpopular.

Labor leader Bill Shorten has also jumped to an 11 point advantage as preferred prime minister over Tony Abbott for the first time ever, leading 51 per cent to 40.

Since Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered the budget on Tuesday, the Abbott Government has been fending off accusations they broke election promises.

Mr Abbott spent Sunday again defending the budget, which includes a Medicare co-payment, pension cuts and a fuel excise rise.

In one interview the Prime Minister admitted his first budget included 'increased taxes' and in another he pointed to selective listening for confusion about election promises.

'Well, I know that people hear different things,' Mr Abbott told ABC's Insiders TV program.

Meanwhile Labor is using the Budget as chance to show a united front.

At the annual Australian Labor Party Conference in Melbourne, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told members the budget had brought Labor together.

'This terrible budget of the Abbott Government, it has defined the Labor party,' he said on Sunday.

'Friends, the Labor Party nationally has its voice back.'

Labor will oppose doctor co-payments, a raised pension age, restrictions on unemployment benefits, cuts to state funding and the fuel excise.

Also on Mr Shorten's hit list is Mr Abbott's 'juvenile' paid parental scheme.

The Opposition Leader claims millionaires will have an extra $50,000 in their pockets they don't need.

'See how that goes for pensioners trying to get an extra smear of vegemite on their toast on day 13 of their budget,' Mr Shorten said.

Labor are joined by The Greens and Palmer United Party who are also opposing several measures.

It means Mr Abbott will have to push hard to win Senate support for the harshest of his budget measures.

Mr Shorten went on further to say the Government was using the state's cuts to schools and hospitals funding as a smokescreen to hit taxpayers with another tax.

'They are actually increasing taxes through the back door,' he told Labor members.

Mr Shorten said the states had no other choice but to raise the GST to recover the lost funding.

LaborÂ have labelled it blackmail as well as the Greens.

But Mr Abbott said it was about ending handouts the Government could not afford.

'What I've got to do is ensure that at the Commonwealth level, we are not living beyond our means, we're not mortgaging our future and piling up never-ending debt for our children and grandchildren,' he told Fairfax radio.

While Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten gave their two cents, state and territory leaders gathered at an emergency meeting in Sydney to discuss the $80 billion hole left in state funding due to cuts in Tuesday's budget.

But the states quashed any chance of a GST or income tax hike - it was something else on their minds.

Following Labor's lead, the leaders took a united front and called for an urgent Council of Australian Governments meeting prior to July 1.

And they aren't the only ones feeling the pinch.

Sunday's latest Galaxy poll, published by News Corporation, showed 75 per cent of people thought they would be worse off because of the budget.

And thousands of protesters who rallied in capital cities reflected that position.

But Mr Abbott continues to insist that the budget was in line with what his government promised, including stopping the boats, cutting the carbon tax, funding better roads and getting the balance sheets under control.

'I don't want to plead the fine print but I do believe that we have fundamentally kept faith with people,' he said.

Mr Abbott said everyone had to share the burden caused by Labor 'spending like a drunken sailor'.

But the Prime Minister did not renew threats to hold a double-dissolution election over the budget, saying the crossbenchers would understand the harsher measures.
