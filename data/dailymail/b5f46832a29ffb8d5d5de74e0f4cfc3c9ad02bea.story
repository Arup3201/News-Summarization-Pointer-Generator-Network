Barcelona star Pedro has cast doubt on his future at the club by admitting he doesn't know where he will be playing next season.

The 27-year-old has endured a frustrating campaign with the Catalan club so far. Despite having made 20 appearances in La Liga this term, only 10 of those coming have come as starts.

Pedro's contract at the Nou Camp expires in 2016, but the forward has revealed that the lack of playing time under boss Luis Enrique could result in him leaving in the summer.

The Spain international has been at Camp Nou for almost 11 years, winning four league titles and two Champions Leagues among a plethora of other trophies. 

'I don't know if I will stay at Barcelona,' he told reporters.

'For now, I am happy at the club, but you never know what is going to happen tomorrow. I am calm, with my mind set on the club until the end of the season and then we will see what happens after that.

'Not having continuity makes things complicated. It is tough, but what I try to do is help out as much as possible.'
