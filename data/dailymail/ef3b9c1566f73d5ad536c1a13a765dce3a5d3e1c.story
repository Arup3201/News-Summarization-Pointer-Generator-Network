His 65th birthday may turn out to be just another working day, but at least Prince Charles will wake up this morning to one of the most beautiful views on earth.

Charles and his wife, Camilla, checked into the Presidential Suite at the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort in rural Kerala on Tuesday night  for some welcome down-time before the last day of their official tour to India.

Described as the ‘only paradise on earth’, the luxury resort is situated on the banks of the Vembanad Lake, a vast stretch of tranquil, emerald green backwaters.

The luxury stay was not quite the romantic getaway Camilla might have hoped for as 30 rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort

The prince woke up to a view like no other to start his birthday at the £500-a-night Presidential Suite at the luxury Kumarakom Lake Resort in rural Kerala

It won’t have been quite the romantic getaway Camilla might have hoped. Thirty rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort.

Still the £500-a-night- presidential suite is a by-word for royal seclusion. Built in traditional local style but with all the mod cons one would expect of a top class hotel, it has its own view of the lake, unimpeded by other guests, a private pool and courtyard.

Hotel managers said Charles and Camilla had requested a ‘day of leisure’ on Wednesday but they had laid on a luxury houseboat and ‘cultural entertainment’ should they decide to venture outside of their room.

The resort’s Ayurvedic spa was also on standby should Camilla request a massage.

The couple checked into the resort on Tuesday night ahead of the last day of their official tour of India

After an early but leisurely breakfast today, the couple will head off on a series of engagements in the bustling city of Cochin before flying onto Sri Lanka, the last leg of their two-week official trip.

Kerala itself is a narrow strip of land, blessed with abundant greenery, situated between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats.

It is renowned for its network of backwaters, unspoiled beaches and exotic wildlife – with a particularly abundant birdlife.
