Belgium is launching a bid to have potato fries recognised as a part of its cultural heritage.

Long believed to have been created in France, Belgians now want the item officially endorsed by the United Nations’ Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).

Both the French-speaking community of Wallonia in southern Belgium and the German-speaking community in the east have announced that they’re joining forces with their Flemish cousins in the north to set up a petition calling for the culinary item to gain UNESCO status.

Belgium is launching a bid to have potato fries and Friktot shops recognised as a part of its cultural heritage

If successful, it means that Belgian fries will be put on a par with the Tower of London, Stonehenge, the Grand Canyon and the Kremlin in Russia.

Belgian fries are traditionally sold in a paper cone from a ‘fritkot’ - a shack or trailer.

There are some 5,000 of these in Belgium, making them ten times more common, per capita, than McDonald's restaurants in the United States.

To become recognized by the United Nations' cultural arm UNESCO, they need to be endorsed by a minister of culture, and Belgium has three of them.

The national association of fritkot owners say that 95 percent of Belgians visit a fritkot at least once a year

The government of the Dutch speaking region of Flanders recognised Belgian fries as an integral part of national culture this year, and the French and German-speaking communities are expected to debate the issue next year.

UNAFRI, the national association of fritkot owners, which started the drive, says the unpolished establishments are uniquely Belgian, combining the country's embrace of chaos with a dislike of corporate uniformity.

‘A cone of potato chips is Belgium in miniature. What's astounding is that this way of thinking is the same, notwithstanding the different communities and regions,’ said spokesman Bernard Lefevre.

UNESCO has a list of 314 items of cultural heritage worthy of preservation, ranging from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon in Arizona

Belgian fries could soon join The Kremlin in Russia as an item of cultural heritage recognised by UNESCO

‘There is a phenomenon we share, German-speakers, French-speakers, Dutch-speakers, and it’s a cone of fries but it’s also this culture which surrounds it.

‘It’s a good product, but it’s a way of living.’

Many tourists join the locals in the long queues at popular Brussels fritkots such as Frit Flagey and Maison Antoine.

‘Before I came here, one of the only things I knew about Belgium was that they liked their fries, so I think they are pretty much there already,’ said Rachael Webb, a visitor from Ottawa, Canada, holding a cone of fries.

UNESCO has a list of 314 items of intangible cultural heritage worthy of preservation, ranging from Turkish coffee to the polyphonic singing of the Aka pygmies of the Central African Republic.

It also has 1007 World Heritage Sites including the Statue of Liberty, The Krelmin and the Tower of London.

Potatoes reached Belgium in the 16th century, but it was not until the 19th century that they were widely sold chipped and fried as a meal in themselves.

UNAFRI says 95 percent of Belgians visit a fritkot at least once a year.
