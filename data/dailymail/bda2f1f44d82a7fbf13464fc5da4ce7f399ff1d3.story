He was only one when his father took him out on a wide board on the Hawaiian swells, and it was instantly clear that Kobi Clements loved to surf.

Now nine-years-old, the rising star from Narrabeen in Northern Sydney, is making a name for himself internationally as the next big thing in the surfing world.

With four sponsors already under his belt, including Volcom, Nixon, Creatures of Leisure and Chilli Surfboards, the charismatic surfer is wowing professionals everywhere.

After winning a number of local junior competitions, including Hurley BL's Blast, Kobi's raw skill has been compared to that of American professional surfer Kelly Slater

The nine-year-old first got on a board with the help of his pro-surfer dad, Steve Clements, in Hawaii when he was only one

Kobi told the Daily Mail Australia that he loves surfing and drawing and hopes to be a professional surfer when he grows up, while his dad laughed in the background describing the big smile on his son's face as he spoke.

'My favourite trick is doing cut backs – It's when you bend your knees and you lean towards the white wash. I like it because I know it the most and it's kind of easy,' Kobi said. 

After competing in a number of local junior competitions, including Hurley BL's Blast, Kobi's skill has been compared to that of a young Kelly Slater, an American professional surfer who has won the title of ASP World Tour Champion 11 times.

But Kobi and his father, former professional surfer Steve Clements, prefer to take a more humble approach to all the positive attention.

'How I look at it is they're comparing him to when those guys were young, they had the same raw talent that Kobi does now, and if they progress that way then there's a good chance they'll be very similar,' Mr Clements said.

'Kobi is very humble. He still loves school and whenever all his teachers and friends say "wow, what you did was amazing" he just doesn't care too much for it. He just goes "yeh, lets go for some handball".'

Kobi's older brother Ethan, 15, and his younger sister Thais, five, were also taught how to surf by their father, who said a regular family day out is spent down at the beach

But despite their humility, Kobi's abilities continue to be showcased around the world. The talented young man is 'making his own tracks' according to his dad, who revealed that his son performed so well in a recent competition in Hawaii that he was invited to an event in the United States.

'We were just there to enjoy the surf and then Volcom told us that he could go into the contest there that had the best surfer kids over there - from nine to 12 years old -  the best of Hawaii,' Mr Clements said.

'It was good solid swell and he got second! He got a barrel and did some nice big manoeuvres -  it's a great start for him.'

At the competition in the United States he finished in the quarter finals.

But for his father, the whole process is about growing up and getting world experiences - not just competing.

Steve also said that before he was sponsored, Kobi would just draw on Volcom's logo onto his board

'He's done a few competitions, but we're not too fussed about all that,' Mr Clements told the Daily Mail Australia.

'It's more about him surfing and getting more experience with what all the conditions are like and learning new things.'

'The opportunity he has to just go surfing and experience life this way - it's only going to make him lead a better life by giving him all these opportunities to travel and see and experience.'

The primary school student is incredibly humble, according to his father who said 'he's outside all the time and just a massive adventurer'

The father-of-three is determined to help his son focus less on competitive attitudes and more on the 'opportunities to just go surfing and lead a better life by traveling and seeing and experiencing things'

From his own experiences, Mr Clements knows all too well what kind of bonuses such experiences can bring. It was at a contest he was participating in himself many years ago that the now recreational surfer, who only just missed out on the World Tour for three years, met his French wife.

It was during another competition, in Hawaii eight years ago, that Mr Clements first noticed Kobi's love for riding waves.

'I was in Hawaii doing some competitive surfing for contests and Kobi was just one-years-old and I borrowed a big flat board and took him out – It was his first time on a board catching a wave, and I just held him and he just enjoyed every moment of it,' the proud father-of-three said.
