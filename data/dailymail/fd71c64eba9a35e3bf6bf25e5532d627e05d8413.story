Uruguay v England in Sao Paulo, two teams still without a point, but both determined to go out and make one.

And for in-form ITV? It was about putting their best foot forward for a peak-time World Cup showdown that should turn out to be the most watched TV programme of the year so far.

Adrian Chiles was joined in their Rio studio by Lee Dixon, former England manager, Glenn Hoddle and Gus Poyet. Missing, and missed by his colleagues and the viewers alike, was Ian Wright who had rushed back to the UK following a disturbing break-in at his family home on Tuesday evening.

Star man: Andros Townsend provided a good presence pitchside for ITV as England lost 2-1 to Uruguay

Primetime: Andros Townsend was placed pitchside by ITV at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo

On site at the Arena Corinthians, ITV were fielding a pair of Townsends, Andros and Andy.

Pitchside was Andros, the ‘come from nowhere’ man who helped steer England to Brazil before injury curtailed his World Cup chances, whilst his namesake Andy was in that most current of hot seats, as England match co-commentator to the experienced Clive Tyldesley.

It is a role that he has done many times but scrutiny on performance would seem to have been ratcheted up in recent days with Phil Neville’s difficult BBC debut.

Neville’s BBC team-mates Danny Murphy and Martin Keown, informed and confident, have impressed in co-commentary.

Good to see the engaging Martin O’Neill joining ITV’s World Cup coverage and immediately adding that sense of curiosity and conflict that he so clearly enjoys. Verbally sparring with Patrick Vieira before like everybody else raving at Tim Cahill’s wonder goal for Australia.

It has also been refreshing to hear both Rio Ferdinand and Neil Lennon express a fan’s wonderment at being ‘privileged’ to be inside the famous Maracana.

And often an unnecessary diversion, in this World Cup the inspired choice of crowd shots has added genuine colour and carnival to the TV viewer’s experience. They’d be spoilt for choice again in Sao Paulo.

ITV opened the programme with the news we all feared - and expected. Suarez in, not 100 per cent, but on the pitch. And that drove the opening thoughts of the experts.

How fit is fit? How dangerous is dangerous? Andros Townsend still thought fit or nearly fit he was a barrel load of trouble: 'He could nutmeg a mermaid.'

'This is knock-out football and no mistake,' Adrian Chiles offered. Not absolutely true but you knew what he meant. And we all felt it.

And in a memorable sequence England players spoke directly to camera of what it meant to them to play for their country. Simple, touching and genuine.

‘You’re not supposed to enjoy watching England in the World Cup, you know that by now.’ Tyldesley and Townsend, Andy, that is, both seasoned England watchers, were off and running.

England started well, a Rooney free-kick went close countered with a shot from Rodriguez. ‘A good spell for England’ Tyldesley offered a little later and it was nearly capped with a goal from Rooney.

Then in the 39th minute Suarez scores a brilliant header. Fit or not fit, he knows where the goal is. ‘It just had to be Luis Suarez.’ We sort of knew it would be, and Suarez's second - the winner -  just confirmed that.
