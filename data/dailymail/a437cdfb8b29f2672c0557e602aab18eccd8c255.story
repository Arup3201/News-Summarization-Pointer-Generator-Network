So far the world of technology has been treated to smartwatches, augmented reality glasses and electronic t-shirts.

But one area of wearable technology that no one's yet put a finger on is the humble fingernail itself.

Thankfully that's all set to change, however, as Tokyo toy company Takara Tomy has released LED stickers for nails that light up when you take a phone call.

Tokyo-based Takara Tomy has released 'smart fingernails' called LumiDecoNail that uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to light up when it comes near an NFC-enabled device. The Android-only technology is currently available just in Japan, but other countries fret not - the company has plans for a worldwide release if they prove popular

The 'LumiDecoNail' uses a technology called Near Field Communication (NFC), in which small amounts of power are transferred very short distances, to communicate with a smartphone.

London-base CuteCircuit claims its wearable technology (right) doesn't compromise on fashion.

It has designed outfits that can change colour, light up or shimmer using an iPhone app.

LED lights are integrated using nylon ribbon removing the need for wires.

The batteries are disguised as buttons or clasps meaning that the designs can be created with traditional fabrics.

This means that when the 'smart nails' come near an NFC device, such as a phone, they will light up.

It also flashes whenever the wearer uses an electronic money card such as a train pass.

The product is on sale in Japan, with a set of 16 nail stickers - one of which contains the LED - costing 1,200 yen (£7; $12).

The micro-thin LED sticker apparently builds on the popularity of manicure 
art - where intricate patterns and small gem-like stones are stuck on 
the nail.

Apple users are sure to be disappointed, however, as the LumiDecoNails are currently only available for a variety of Android devices.

The product is marketed mainly at young people, said company spokeswoman Misayo Aruga.

'I am now wearing it on the middle finger of my right hand,' she said in a press release.

'It blinks whenever I pass through train gates, which lifts my heart a bit.'

While the product is only on sale in Japan for now, fingernail tech-enthusiasts in other countries such as the U.S. and UK need not worry.

The company will consider marketing the cosmetic product overseas after seeing how consumers in Japan react.
