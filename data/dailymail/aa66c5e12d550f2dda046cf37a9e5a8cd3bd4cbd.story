A former Idaho aerospace executive accused of slapping a crying toddler on a plane and hurling a racial slur at him will plead guilty, it was revealed today.

An email from federal prosecutors did not say what charge Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, will plead guilty to during a hearing today. He faces one count of misdemeanor simple assault.

His trial had been set to begin Thursday in federal court in Atlanta.

Admission of guilt: Joe Rickey Hundley, 60 (left), is expected to enter a guilty plea in connection to the February incident in which he allegedly assaulted 19-month old Jonah Bennett (right) after he started crying on a flight

Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land

Hundley, who lived in Idaho at the time, was on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta on Feb. 8 and was seated in a window seat next to Jessica Bennett, who was sitting in the aisle seat and had her 19-month-old adopted black son on her lap, according to court filings.

At the beginning of the flight, Hundley pressed the call button and asked a flight attendant about the airline's policy regarding 'lap children,' prosecutors said in a filing. The way he asked the question made it clear he was unhappy about the child's presence, prosecutors wrote.

As the plane descended into Atlanta, the child started crying. Hundley, who is white, leaned over to Bennett and 'told her to shut that n***** baby up,' according to a sworn statement from an FBI agent who investigated the incident.

Bennett asked Hundley what he had said, and he leaned in with his face up next to hers and said it again, prosecutors said in a filing.

Hundley then slapped the child in the face, leaving a scratch below his right eye, the FBI agent's statement says.

Mr Hundley has since moved to North Carolina after being fired amid widespread outrage.

In March, Hundley entered a not guilty plea and was released from jail on $10,000 bond. The 60-year-old now faces a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.

Hundley's
attorney said earlier this year that her client was on his way to take 
his son off life support after being told just 24 hours earlier that he 
had overdosed on insulin, and was 'upset and grieving' at the time of 
the incident.

Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up'

Hundley's son was 'in a coma for 
life,' attorney Marcia Shein said in a statement. 'On the flight, he was
in distress, upset and grieving,' she said.

The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, of 
Minneapolis who is white, was seated with her adopted black son, Jonah, 
when she says Hundley struck her child after using a racial slur 
directed at them.

'Shut that
n****r baby up,' he allegedly told the mother while their Delta was descending from Minneapolis into Atlanta.

Shein
said he did use a racial slur when the child started crying because of 
ear pressure, but she denied that Hundley struck the boy.

In media interviews, the child's mother has said Hundley was belligerent and seemed intoxicated during the flight.

'I said, "What did you just say?" And
he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to 
my ear and he said it directly into my ear,' She told ABC News. It was then she said that Hundley lifted and 
swung his hand at her child.

Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers'

Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby'

'When I looked at Jonahâ€™s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death,' she said.

She says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since.

Hundley
was fired from his executive position at AGC Aerospace & Defense in the aftermath of the media firestorm spark by the altercation, his attorney said.

The
Oklahoma City-based military technology company issued a statement 
describing the executive's behavior as 'offensive and disturbing.'

Lawyers for Hundley had said in court filings that the amount of 
media coverage his case received was highly unusual for a misdemeanor 
charge and added that 'it is impossible to avoid the reality that the 
national media has painted Mr. Hundley as a villain.'

Hundley's son, whose age was not given, died the day after the flight, Shein said.

Fired: Hundley was an executive at AGC Aerospace & Defense before he was fired after the incident for what his company called disturbing allegations

Hundley 'has paid a terrible price for his hurtful words,' his lawyer said.

The 60-year-old previously also denied using racial language, claiming he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.'

Hundley previously said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a 
hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft.

However,
Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated.
The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around 
wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight.

Bennett said Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.'

Agent Cheney added that Bennett 
received help from other passengers on the flight.

Todd Wooten, 
who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory
language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was
going on.

'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child.

Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in 
2007 after he was arrested following a fight with his girlfriend.

He was first charged with simple assault, carrying a concealed weapon, and public intoxication. Hundley told The Smoking Gun that the weapon he was allegedly carrying was a corkscrew.
