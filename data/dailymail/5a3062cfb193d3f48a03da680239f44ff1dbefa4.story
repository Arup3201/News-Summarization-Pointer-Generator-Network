Youth unemployment is falling faster in Britain than in any major global economy, employment minister Esther McVey will boast on a visit to Australia today.

More than 6million people aged 16-24 are in work or studying after businesses made a 'game-changing investment' in the nation's young people, Miss McVey claims.

The senior Conservative is in Melbourne for a meeting of G20 ministers, where she will examine the use of psychological tests to see if the unemployed are 'determined', 'bewildered' or 'despondent' about taking a job.

Between the last quarter of the 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, the UK saw a bigger fall in youth unemployment than in the whole of the EU, the G7 and the OECD

The dramatic recovery in the jobs market has been one of the major economic success stories of the last 12months.

Last week figures showed that in the last four years the number of people in work in the UK has increased by more than the rest of the EU put together.

However, the coalition has faced criticism for high levels of youth unemployment, which Miss McVey insists is now falling sharply.

The Department for Work and Pensions pointed to figures which show that in the first three months of 2014, youth unemployment fell faster in the UK than any G7 country, including the US, Canada, Japan, Italy, France and Germany. 

Employment minister Esther McVey told MailOnline the falls in youth unemployment have not 'happened by accident'

Ahead of Miss McVey's trip Down Under, officials noted that 'while youth unemployment is rising in Australia, the UK has seen impressive recent falls'.

Miss McVey told MailOnline: 'We've just seen the fastest drop in youth unemployment in the G7 in the last three months - and this hasn't happened by accident.

'I believe the hard work or our frontline staff, the reforms we've brought in, and the enthusiasm and professionalism of our young people have all played a role in the UK leading the way.'

In the first three months of this year, youth unemployment fell by 5.38 per cent in the UK, compared to falls of 2.1 per cent in the EU as a whole, 0.85 per cent in Germany and 0.3 per cent in France. The average in the OECD was a fall of just 0.14 per cent.

Across the G7, there was a rise of 0.01 per cent, driven by larger numbers of young unemployed people in Canada (up 0.35 per cent), USA (1.45) and Italy (1.73). Australia saw a rise of 0.54 per cent.

Year-on-year, only the USA saw a bigger drop than the UK, where the number of 15-24 year olds out of work fell by 10.15 per cent.

Miss McVey is attending the meeting of G20 employment ministers ahead of the heads of government summit in Brisbane in November.

She will examine Australian attitude tests which are used to identify jobseekers who are less mentally prepared and gives them intensive coaching at jobcentres.

Miss McVey's 'segmentation' programme has been inspired by the work of the wife of the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Therese Rein.

Her company has used attitude profiling in back-to-work schemes since the 1990s.

A UK pilot scheme is taking place in three job centres and, if successful, it will be rolled out for a voluntary trial involving 27,000 jobseekers in 27 cities.

In the 12 months to March 2014, only the US saw a bigger drop in youth unemployment, according to OECD data

Miss McVey added: 'With our help, British businesses are making a game-changing investment in our young people by supporting them to get the skills and work experience they need to build the careers they want.

'A generation of young Brits are being helped to build a career and find their way in the world of work, inspiring their peers to follow in their footsteps and helping their country compete on the world stage.'

'Young people tell me they need work experience to get a job, but they need a job to get work experience, which is why our advisers in Jobcentre Plus work closely with local businesses to provide tailored training opportunities for young jobseekers across the UK.'

Since January 2011, more than 260,000 young people have taken part in employer-led placements or work experience through jobcentres.

The number of jobless young people who have left full-time education has fallen by 174,000 in the last year.
