The gilded streets of Los Angeles are a long way from Southeast Asia – but the backlash over the harsh new anti-gay laws introduced in the small country of Brunei has now travelled all the way over the Pacific to a deeply influential part of the world. Hollywood.

In the pink: The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a favourite retreat of Hollywood stars since it opened in 1912 - but has found itself at the centre of protests against its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, and Brunei's new anti-gay laws

A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel

A growing band of film stars, celebrities and other famous figures are joining forces to put pressure on the state’s ruler, the Sultan of Brunei, by targeting the properties he owns.

And firmly in the firing line is the celebrated Beverly Hills Hotel – the revered 102-year-old retreat for the great and the good, which – thanks to the fact that it is now owned by the Sultan – is rapidly losing friends and customers as the film world registers its anger.

Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week

The Motion Picture & Television Fund is the latest group to join a lengthening list of organisations and individuals refusing to do business with hotels owned by the Sultan or the government of Brunei.

It says it will no longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel – usually staged there in March – as it has for many years.

The Fund says it is making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and abortions, with flogging and stoning.

‘We cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's directors have said in a statement.

Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected

Prominent figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it opened its doors in 1912.

Divisive: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's new anti-gay laws have sparked outrage

Branson tweeted over the weekend that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester Collection property – the hotel group which includes the Beverly Hills Hotel, and is owned by Brunei – ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’

Mavis Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay Leno, says the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no place in civilised society.’

In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills has voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws.

The resolution urges Brunei to divest its ownership of the hotel and any other properties it owns within Beverly Hills. Emotions were high yesterday in the city’s council chambers as scores of employees, as well as local residents, expressed their concern.

Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’

Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery.

The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years.

The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected.

‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds," Christopher Cowdray has said in a statement.

The surge in celebrity opinion against the Dorchester Collection has also made its presence felt in Britain. Last week, Stephen Fry cancelled a planned stay at Coworth Park in Berkshire after realising that it was part of the hotel group.

He tweeted: 'Cancelled in nick of time: discovered @CoworthParkUK that I was booked into is part of the “Dorchester Collection”.'

The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history.

Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.
