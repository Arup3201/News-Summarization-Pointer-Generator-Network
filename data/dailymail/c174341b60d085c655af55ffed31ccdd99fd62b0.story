An Australian disability activist who is confined to a wheelchair says having a disability doesn't make you exceptional.

Stella Young, 32, believes those with a disability are often objectified by able-bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves.Â 

The comedian and writer said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people.

'I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember by own name,' Ms Young said.

Her comments were made during a TEDxSydney event at the Sydney Opera House in April.

Ms Young said while she wasn't trying to put forward this perspective as the 'right' one, she's had really positive reactions from people since the talk.

'I think it's really helpful to consider a lot of different perspectives, because disability really is a complex set of social circumstances we try to reduce to something simple and palatable,' she told MailOnline.

'Lots of disabled people have said that they've always felt like this and never been able to put their finger on why it makes them feel uncomfortable. Almost as many have disagreed and that's fine! We're a wildly diverse mob.'

Ms Young, who was born with a bone condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta, said back in April that inspirational quotes like 'the only disability in life is a bad attitude' are bull s***.

'It's just not true because of the social model of disability. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp,' she said.

'People, when they say, "You're an inspiration," they mean it as a compliment. And I know why it happens. It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional. And it honestly doesn't.'

Ms Young said this particular view dawned on her when she was training to be a teacher at a Melbourne high school several years ago and a Year 11 boy asked her when she was going to 'do her speech'.

'I said, "What speech?" And he said, "You know, like, your motivational speaking. You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school, they usually say, like, inspirational stuff? It's usually in the big hall",' she said.

'That's when it dawned on me... This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration. For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists. We're not real people. We are there to inspire.'

Ms Young, who grew up in rural Victoria, recalled this mentality even back when she was a teenager when someone in her neighbourhood wanted to nominate her for a community award.

'My parents said "that's really nice, but there's kind of one glaring problem with that. She hasn't actually achieved anything",' she said.

She believes those with a disability are often objectified by able-bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves

'I went to school, I got good marks, I had a very low-key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon, and I spent a lot of time watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek.

'But they were right, you know. I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all. I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation.'

She said she wanted to live in a world where a girl sitting in her room watching Buffy the Vampire slayer wasn't considered like she was achieving anything just because she was sitting down in a wheelchair.
