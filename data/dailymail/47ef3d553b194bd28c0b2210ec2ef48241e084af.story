Monsters: Jorge Beltrao Negromonte da Silveira, his wife Isabel Cristina Pires lured women to their house by promising them a job as a nanny. Then they killed them and ate their flesh in meat-filled pastries

Guilty: Bruna Cristina Oliveira da Silva, who lived with the couple, was Silveira's mistress

An official at the court in the city of Olinda, on Brazil's northeastern Atlantic coast, said the seven-person jury handed down the sentences on Friday night.

The three were arrested in the city of Garanhuns in April 2012, and police said they confessed to the crimes.

At the time, they reportedly told police they belonged to a sect that preached 'the purification of the world and the reduction of its population'.

They were convicted of murder, desecration and concealment of a body.

Officers said the trio lured women to their house by promising them a job as a nanny. It was said they then used the victims' flesh to make thick empada pastries, which were eaten by them and a child who lived with them.

The pastries were also sold to some neighbours, schools and hospitals who were told they contained tuna or chicken, authorities said.

Remains of the two women were found in the home's backyard.

Shortly after the three suspects' arrest, police found a 50-page book written by Silveira entitled Revelations of a schizophrenic, in which he said he heard voices and was obsessed with killing women.

The G1 news site quoted Silveira as saying during the trial's opening: 'I committed a horrible, monstrous mistake. It was a moment of extreme weakness and brutality that I regret.'

Their victims, believed to have been killed between 2008 and 2012, include Alexandra Falcao, 20, police said.

Silviera also described the death of Jessica Camila da Silva Pereira, a 17-year-old murdered in 2008.

Police were alerted to the murders when the trio attempted to use a credit card belonging to one of their victims.
