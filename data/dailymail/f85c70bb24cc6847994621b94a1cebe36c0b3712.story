Australia have added seamers Gurinder Sandhu and Kane Richardson to their squad for the Carlton Mid Tri-Series against England and India.

Sandhu, 21, is uncapped while Richardson played the last of his eight one-day internationals in November.

The pair are not part of the 15-man World Cup squad but are on hand for the first part of the preparatory series to give the likes of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson the chance to rest.

Seamer Gurinder Sandhu has been called into Australia's squad to face England and India this month

Fast-bowler Kane Richardson will also be in the one-day international squad for the tri-series

Johnson is not expected to feature until Australia's third match in Hobart on January 23.

A Cricket Australia statement read: 'Given the heavy workloads undertaken by Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood during the fourth Test, and the hamstring problems recently suffered by Perth-based pair Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Marsh, the selectors have named South Australia's Kane Richardson and New South Wales seamer Gurinder Sandhu as extra bowling options for the early matches of the Tri-Series.'

Mitchell Johnson will be rested for some games and will not play until the third ODI
