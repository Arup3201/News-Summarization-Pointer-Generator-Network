This incredible picture shows a dying sun which has burst back to life for a final, doomed blaze of glory.

The perishing star - which was once like our own Sun - has burst briefly back to life after casting gassy shells out into the surrounding space.

The image of the planetary nebula Abell 30 is a composite of visible images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and X-ray data from ESA’s XMM-Newton and NASA’s Chandra space telescopes.

Abell 30: This born-again planetary nebula shows how our own Sun may one day look as it burns out

It is 5,500 light years from Earth, but mimics the possible fate our own solar system faces in a few billion years.

'Planetary
nebula' is the name given to the often-concentric shells of stellar 
material cast into space by dying stars like this one.

The intricate pattern of planetary nebula Abell 30 revealed in the picture above combines optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images with XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray data.

In the main image a large spherical shell is seen in emission of hydrogen (blue) and oxygen (red) as the result of the star’s outer shell being stripped off by a dense wind and expanding outward over the last 12 500 years.

During the ‘born-again’ phase in the star’s evolution, it expelled knots of helium and carbon-rich material. A subsequent fast wind is streaming past this material to form the flower-like structure seen in oxygen emission (red) to produce shock-heated gas seen in X-rays (purple).

The inset panel zooms in to the heart of the planetary nebula to reveal intricate details closer to the star. The tail-like structures (orange) mark the dense knots of material from the ‘born-again’ event and are seen in HST images. X-ray emission from this evolutionary phase is shown in purple. 

To astronomers of the 18th century, these objects looked like the colourful ‘blob’ of a planet through their telescopes, and the name has stuck.

Now scientists know that as a star with less than eight times the mass of the Sun swells into a red giant towards the end of its life, its outer layers are expelled via pulsations and winds.

Ultraviolet radiation shining out from the stripped-down, but still hot stellar core then lights up the ejected shells, resulting in intricate artwork-like phenomena that can be seen by modern telescopes.

A ‘homeless planet’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time.

Scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade, although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘needle in a thousand haystacks’.

The isolated planet, shown below in an artist's impression, which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation, is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away.

The star at the heart of Abell 30 
experienced its first brush with death 12,500 years ago – as seen from 
Earth – when its outer shell was stripped off by a slow and dense 
stellar wind.

Optical telescopes see the remnant of this evolutionary stage as a large, near-spherical shell of glowing material expanding out into space.

Then, about 850 years ago, the star suddenly came back to life, violently coughing out knots of helium and carbon-rich material. 

The star’s outer envelope briefly expanded during this born-again episode, but then very rapidly contracted again within 20 years.

This had the knock-on effect of accelerating the wind from the star to its present speed of 4,000 kilometres per second – over 14million kilometres per hour (8.7million miles per hour).

As this fast stellar wind catches up and interacts with the slower wind and clumps of previously ejected material, complex structures are formed, including the delicate comet-like tails seen near the star in the centre of this image.

The stellar wind bombarding these dense clumps of material provides a chilling look at the possible fate of Earth and its fellow planets in our own solar system in a few billion years’ time.

When our Sun emits its final gasps of life at the heart of a planetary nebula, its strong stellar wind and harsh radiation will blast and evaporate any planets that may have survived the red giant phase of stellar evolution.

If any distant civilisation is watching with high-power telescopes at the time, they might see the glowing embers of the planets light up in X-rays as they are engulfed in the stellar wind.

5,500 light years from Earth, it's fate mimics that which probably awaits our own solar system in a few billion years
