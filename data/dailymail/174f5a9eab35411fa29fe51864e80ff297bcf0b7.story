Two siblings are set to compete against each other in the world's most famous steeplechase – the Grand National at Aintree - and one could even make history.

Katie Walsh, 28, hopes to become the first female jockey to win the race, but the amateur rider has some stiff competition in her older brother Ruby.

The pair have been dubbed ‘racing royalty’ following in the footsteps of their trainer father Ted – who has a stake in the race of his own.

Family matters: Brother and sister Katie and Ruby Walsh are set to compete against each other today

When Katie entered the race last year 
she  became the 15th female jockey to ride in the Grand National since 
Charlotte Brew made history on Barony Fort in 1977.

She placed third, making her the most successful female Grand National jockey to date.

Success in today’s race would catapult 
her to superstardom not only across Britain and her native 
Ireland, but all around the globe.

She has extensive riding experience 
including two winners at the Cheltenham Festival.

Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation 
chief executive Sue Tibballs said: 'This is an incredibly exciting time 
in the Grand National's long history. Katie Walsh being on the brink of 
being the first woman to win the National represents a pivotal moment in
the sport.'

She added: 'It is important to recognise that 
women can compete on equal terms with men in this event, and that their 
achievements as top athletes are recognised.

'Having a female athlete come top in such a prestigious and well-loved race will be a breakthrough moment for women in sport.'

Katie will be riding Seabass, the same mount with which she took third place in last year's race.

Her brother Ruby, a double Grand 
National winner, rides On His Own, and together they are riding two of 
this year's most-fancied horses.

Their father Ted Walsh, trains Katie’s
Seabass as well as Colbert Station, the mount of champion jockey AP 
McCoy who is another hot tip for today’s race.

Even in the current economic climate 
Ladbrokes predicts that up to £200 million could be bet on the race on 
the biggest day of the bookmaking year.

William Hill have odds of 40-1 of a 
Walsh 1-2-3 with Colbert Station, Seabass and On His Own to fill the 
first three places in any order. They also make it 11-10 that Katie 
beats her brother in the race and 4-6 that Ruby finishes higher than 
Katie.

‘The Walsh family are racing royalty 
and have a great history with the Grand National, Ruby has ridden two 
winners and Ted has trained one already,’ a spokesman for William Hill 
said.

‘So it would be more than fitting if 
little sister Katie was the one to make it to the record books as the 
first female winner and she has a real chance on the horse she came 
third on last year.

‘Despite her amateur status, she is a 
very experienced rider and there is no doubt Katie and Seabass will be 
giving all the boys a run for their money on Saturday.’

Ladbrokes said it had noticed a 
'number of bets where the feeling is a woman might win' and Paddy Power 
has put on a number of special bets as punters are interested in the 
family connection.

The Walsh Specials are 'currently a five figure market,' a Paddy Power spokesman said.

If Katie Walsh wins she would also be 
the first amateur victor since Marcus Armytage steered Mr Frisk to 
victory in 1990. Her amateur status also means she does not get paid for
the ride and would not receive the normal professional jockey's seven 
per cent of the prize money, nearly £40,000 if she won the National.
