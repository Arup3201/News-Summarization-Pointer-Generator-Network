The startling appearance of a ‘blue’ fox at a Travelodge has sparked a mystery in south-east London.

Guests at the busy hotel in Woolwich were shocked when the bewildered fox wandered inside and had to be coaxed out with a packet of crisps.

What made the situation even more bizarre was the animal’s coat, which had somehow become covered in blue paint.

Guests whipped out their smartphones to snap photos of the fox, which appeared to be cowering in a corner at one point.

It mooched around the bar and reception area, looking a little confused, as staff and guests devised a plan.

One guest, now dubbed ‘a fox whisperer’, managed to lure the fox outside by laying a trail of Doritos.

Referring to comedian Lenny Henry, who appears in adverts for Travelodge rival Premier Inn, guest Scott Farnell, who photographed the urban fox, tweeted: ‘What’s going on here then? Lenny Henry wouldn’t stand for this?’

Scott said he was scared of the animal and the hotel receptionist tried contact the RSPCA for help but there was no answer.

A second photo showed a man laying a trail of crisps.

Scott added: ‘Fox whisperer has taken care of him. Likes Doritos.’

The RSPCA said they were investigating the incident.

A spokesman said they had not seen a blue fox before and don't know how it managed to become that colour.

With more than 35,000 urban foxes in London, it’s not unusual for encounters of the unusual kind to be reported.

To keep foxes at bay the Royal Borough of Greenwich recommends residents and businesses ensure their bins are securely shut, that rubbish sacks are not left beside their wheelie bins, and that they never feed the animals.
