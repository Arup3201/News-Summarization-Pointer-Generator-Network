Two men have been arrested at an airport after Customs officers noticed an 'abnormal bulge' near one of the passenger's groin region.

Almost five kilograms of cocaine were allegedly found to have been stuffed down the 26-year-old Brazilian man's pants during the subsequent frisk search at Brisbane Airport on Wednesday.

A 23-year-old Brazilian man travelling with him was also allegedly found to be carrying the drug.

They had been selected by the Border Protection officers for a baggage examination after arriving from Auckland, according to customs.

'During the examination, officers noticed an abnormal bulge located in the vicinity of the 26-year-old’s groin and a frisk search was conducted, which allegedly revealed a concealment of cocaine,' Customs said in a statement.

Acting Regional Commander Queensland John Ikin said Customs and Border Protection is committed to preventing illegal drugs from entering Australia.

'Our officers are specialists at detecting drug concealments,' Mr Ikin said.

'If people think they can smuggle illegal substances into Australia past Customs and Border Protection they are sorely mistaken.

'Importers of illicit drugs can face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

'Smuggling drugs is simply not worth the risk.'

Both men were referred to the Australian Federal Police and faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday, according to The Courier Mail.

They will remain in custody until the matter is resumed on March 19.
