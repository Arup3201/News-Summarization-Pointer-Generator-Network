An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer in Las Vegas for his bachelor party has been killed trying to stop a carjacker who stop his pickup truck from a car valet on the Strip. 

Jesus Manuel Magdaleno Jr. was loading his suitcases into his Ford F-150 with his brother-in-law Felix Cruz to return home on Sunday, when a man jumped into the running vehicle and took off with Cruz still in the bed.

Magaleno, 33, ran after the pickup, shouted that he was a CHP officer and jumped into the cargo bed with his sister's husband, Mr Cruz, while the driver sped wildly away from the Flamingo hotel-casino, according to a police report.

Horrific: The carjacker crashed into an SUV and totaled Jesus Manuel Magdaleno Jr.'s truck as he was trying to flee the scene on the Las Vegas Strip

Mourned: Jesus Magdaleno Jr., 33, was an eight-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol. He was set to be married next month and was in Las Vegas for his bachelor party

Magdaleno and Cruz had been loading luggage with the engine running and the driver door open.

'They were heading home after an enjoyable time, and they became victims of a horrible crime,' Las Vegas police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said.

'A vehicle is being stolen. His friend is in the bed of the vehicle. He runs to the aid of his friend who is in danger,' Steiber said of Magdaleno. 'He gave his life for someone else.'

A witness on the 17th floor of a nearby casino heard the commotion and told police she saw the white 2009 Ford F150 accelerate away from the Strip, mow down construction cones and speed through red lights on an Interstate 15 overpass.

The woman heard the two men in the back of the truck shouting for help before the pickup collided with a 2001 Ford Escape SUV and slammed into a traffic signal pole about 11 a.m. Sunday in front of the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino, about a mile west of the Flamingo.

Magdaleno and Cruz were thrown from the bed of the truck.

Five people, including the car thief were injured in the crash. Magdaleno's brother-in-law was critically injured and is not expected to survive

Magdaleno, 33, an eight-year CHP veteran from Visalia, was killed. He was due to be married in September.

Cruz, 31, was in critical condition Monday at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. He is not expected to survive, authorities said.

The alleged car thief, James Robert Montgomery, 29, of Tustin, California, was arrested and hospitalized after the crash and booked into the Clark County jail on felony murder, kidnapping, auto theft, battery and robbery charges pending an initial court appearance. 

Three people in the SUV were treated for minor injuries, police Officer Laura Meltzer said.

Montgomery told police he remembered walking around the Flamingo and being in a car crash, but couldn't remember anything in between, according to the arrest report.

The car thief smashed into an oncoming SUV at high speed. Magdaleno and his brother-in-law, who was both in the back, were thrown from the truck

Montgomery spoke with a taxi driver before climbing into the driver's seat of Magdaleno's pickup, the arrest report said. Surveillance footage showed Magdaleno chase the vehicle and jump in the bed when it stopped for traffic.

The videos were impounded as evidence and not made public.

Flamingo owner Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokeswoman Debbie Munch issued a statement extending sympathy to the families and friends of the two men. She said the company was cooperating with the police investigation.

The incident was latest in a series of violent acts on the Strip, including a shooting one week earlier involving an off-duty Las Vegas police detective and a man accused of trying to steal a car in a loading zone outside the Excalibur hotel-casino.

Saul Villegas, 27, of Bellflower, California, faces an attempted auto theft charge after police alleged he got into Detective Bernard Plaskett's wife's car and refused to get out.

Plaskett, 54, a 20-year department veteran, shot Villegas once in the wrist, police said. Plaskett is on paid leave pending a departmental review of the shooting.
