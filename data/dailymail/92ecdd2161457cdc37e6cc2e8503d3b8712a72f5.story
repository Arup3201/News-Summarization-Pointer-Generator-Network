Francois Hollande’s government performed an embarrassing U-turn yesterday after his mistress was chosen for a top public job.

The French president faced ridicule when it was announced that his secret lover, actress Julie Gayet, was to join a prestigious panel to decide arts funding.

The decision was made before his infidelity with Miss Gayet, who is reported to be four months pregnant, became public. She has denied the pregnancy claims.

Prestigious role: Francois Hollande's mistress has been denied a role as member of the Villa Medici jury for 2014

Yesterday the embattled President’s aides hastily blocked the appointment.

Mr
 Hollande, 59, was already under fire for keeping his humiliated first 
lady, Valerie Trierweiler, on the public payroll, despite confessing 
about his year-long affair with Miss Gayet, 41.

Yesterday
 the Academy of France website reported that Miss Gayet was to become a 
member of the jury on a prestigious cultural committee that chooses 
artists to receive grants to stay at France’s Medici institute in Rome.

The French press continued largely to ignore their leader’s duplicity yesterday.

The
 country’s main newspapers seem to agree with Francois Hollande that his
 ‘painful’ private life is not a matter for the public – no matter how 
much taxpayers’ money is being spent on it.

Both Le Figaro and Le Monde concentrated on the Socialist’s announcement of £43billion spending cuts.

They
 did have short stories about his affair with Julie Gayet but Le Monde 
carried a comment piece on his private life with the headline: ‘Three in
 four French people do not care.’

The glamorous actress did adorn the front covers of the weekly magazines, with Elle calling her ‘a French passion’.

It was to have been ratified by arts minister Aurelie Filipetti, who 
chose Miss Gayet to ‘please Hollande’, according to Paris weekly Le 
Canard Enchaine.

But the 
appointment threatened to sabotage Mr Hollande’s attempts to separate 
his ‘painful’ love life from his public duties and government officials 
rushed to insist it was just a ‘nomination’ and had been withdrawn.

A
 spokesman said Miss Gayet’s career as an actress meant she was a 
‘totally legitimate’ candidate for the jury but that Miss Filipetti 
‘decided not to make the appointment’.

The
 appointment also raised questions about the way in which the women in 
Mr Hollande’s  life seem to have easy access to public roles.

He has 
refused to tell France which of the two women in his life is the 
country’s first lady, saying it was a ‘private’ matter – despite the 
role costing taxpayers an estimated £70,000  a month.

Miss
 Gayet was reported to have been boasting to friends of her ‘politician 
lover’ for months, but it emerged last night she is to sue French 
Closer, the magazine that exposed her affair, for breach of privacy.

The President initially threatened to do the same but has now decided against it.

Miss
 Trierweiler, 48, has been in hospital for nearly a week suffering 
‘extreme emotional shock’ after Mr Hollande confessed to her that he had
 been sneaking off on a scooter to spend nights with Miss Gayet, a 
mother of two.

The first lady is being treated for exhaustion at 
Pitie-Salpetriere – the Paris hospital where Princess Diana died in 
1997.

France’s Grazia 
magazine reported that Miss Trierweiler had suspected Mr Hollande of 
having an affair since last summer and made a ‘desperate’ bid to 
befriend Segolene Royal, who was Mr Hollande’s partner of 28 years 
before he switched his affections to Miss Trierweiler.

‘It was an appeal for feminine solidarity,’ said the magazine.

‘But after years of rivalry, obviously Miss Royal did  not respond.’
