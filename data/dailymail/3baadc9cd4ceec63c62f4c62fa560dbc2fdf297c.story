My confession: Barry McOwen, 67, confessed to drugging and molesting three young girls on the second day of his trial

A 67-year-old man tearfully confessed to sexually abusing three little girls in a surprising turn of events.

Barry McOwen, of Upper Salford, Pennsylvania, shockingly took the witness stand before testimony began on the second day of his trial. 

During his confession, McOwen read from a prepared statement that he pleaded guilty to the charges of rape of a child, sexual abuse, and dissemination and possession of child pornography.

Parents of the three victims who were in the courthouse said they were relieved that neither they nor their daughters would have to relive horrific memories while testifying.

According to Philly.com, McOwen abused the three girls in his care – aged four to ten at the time – between 2006 and 2011.

He said he committed the crimes while babysitting the three girls. According to testimony from the first day, he drugged the girls with Benadryl, what he called ‘half a roofie’ and ‘my special juice,’ according to The Mercury.

In fact, McOwen showed little emotion while Assistant District Attorney Samantha Cauffman made her opening statements during the trial’s first day. She accused him of being a ‘thief in the night’ who stole ‘their innocence again and again.’

Judge William R. Carpenter accepted the plea agreement, and sentenced McOwen to 50.5 to 101 years behind bars.

Ms Cauffman told the Montgomery News that though shocking, she was pleased with the trial’s outcome.

‘I think justice was done,’ she said, adding: ‘This man should never see the light of day again, and that was my ultimate goal.’

According to the Mercury, McOwen initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, and so the court went ahead with the first day of testimony.

County Detective Mary Anders told the jury that authorities identified the three victims through clothing they were wearing in pictures seized from McOwen’s computer.

Authorities recovered explicit online chats where McOwens would talk about 'sleep assaulting' the girls, bragging to his friends about his so-called conquests.

They also found thousands of pornographic images of children.

Det. Anders told the court that the girl’s parents were also asked to identify whether or not the girl in the picture was their daughter. ‘They were both pretty distraught,’ she said.

Family members of the three girls who were in the courtroom wept after hearing McOwen’s confession – meaning they were spared the horror of hearing of their children’s abuse all over again.
