Ministers have ordered an inquiry into Jihadi John's secondary school after it emerged that two other former pupils went on to become terrorists.

Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London.

Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia.

Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers.

Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school.

Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised.

The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming  extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said.

The spokesman added: 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category.

'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years.

'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern.

'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 

'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.'

The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi.

Ellekhlifi was fighting alongside al-Qaeda linked extremists in Syria when he was killed by government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11, 2013.

Sakr was fighting with al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate, which has been responsible for a series of atrocities including the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed.

Quintin Kynaston Academy's current headteacher has insisted the school is not a breeding ground for terrorists.

Alex Atherton told The Telegraph: 'QK has been proactive in working with the government's Prevent strategy, and this has resulted in positive work around the well-being and safety of our students.

'Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at QK, and we will continue to put in place support mechanisms to make sure all our students feel safe and that they can raise any concerns.' 

One unnamed man who claimed to be a student alongside Ellekhlifi at QK told the paper he and his friends saw 'quite a lot of young men going towards a radicalised direction', but said he didn't realise the extent of it, adding 'It was a massive shock' when he learnt that Ellekhlifi went to Syria.

MailOnline have contacted Quintin Kynaston Academy for a comment.
