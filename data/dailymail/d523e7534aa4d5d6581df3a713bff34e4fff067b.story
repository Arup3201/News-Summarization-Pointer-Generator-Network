A history teacher has courted controversy at a Californian high school after posing as Trayvon Martin in the annual yearbook.

Spencer Smith, a senior history teacher at Heritage High School in Brentwood, appears in the photo wearing a hoodie pulled down over his head and is prominently holding a bag of Skittles.

Smith hasn’t commented publicly about his reasons for making the provocative pose, but it prompted much debate at the school on Thursday after the yearbook was published.

Spencer Smith, a history teacher at Heritage High School in Brentwood, California, has courted controversy by posing as Trayvon Martin in the school's yearbook

Alfreda Charway, the high school's Black Student Union President, said it was ‘a good idea because he's expressing himself.’

‘Because that's the whole point of yearbook pictures, you're supposed to express yourself,’ Charway told KTVU.

Sophomore Amber McKim thought it was ‘okey that he did it, just not in the yearbook.’

‘I think he can do it at his house or on his Facebook. But not in the yearbook,’ she said.

Parents, however, thought it was ‘inappropriate.’

Trayvon Martin was tragically gunned down by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman in 2012

One mom, who didn't want to be named, said: ‘I think that's very inappropriate for a yearbook. This is supposed to be capturing the best moments of the year. And all positive things.’

'I think you could take it different ways, but I think a high school yearbook as a teacher is not the place to make your stance,' said parent Michelle Alameda.

The school's principal has said he will investigate the issue before releasing a statement.

'I don't know what kind of message he 
was trying to send, but I think he just wanted to draw more attention to
 it,' said Charway.

Martin was tragically gunned down by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman in 2012.

Zimmerman was tried last summer for the murder, but was acquitted in the highly controversial and racially charged case.
