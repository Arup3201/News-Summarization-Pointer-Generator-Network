Russell Armstrong had stopped taking anti-depressant drugs a fortnight before he committed suicide, it has been claimed.

The venture capitalist is said to have been taking the prescription medication to control his rage issues.

He had been taking the drugs for several
months, and it later emerged his wife Taylor was leaving him after 
accusing him of domestic abuse.

Tragic: Russell Armstrong is said to have stopped taking anti-depressants two weeks before he committed suicide

An insider told RadarOnline: 'Russell had been doing so well when he was on the anti-depressants.

'He was prescribed the meds to control his rage issues. Russell stopped taking the meds two weeks before his suicide.

'Taylor was very supportive of him taking the meds.

'All of a sudden about two weeks ago, Russell stopped taking the meds though.'

Ed Winter, Assistant Coroner for Los Angeles said: 'No medication bottles for Mr. Armstrong were recovered from the scene.'

It has also been revealed Taylor Armstrong is terrified of meeting the family of her dead husband Russell at his memorial service this week.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star thinks his family blame her for the venture capitalist committing suicide in Los Angeles last week.

And she is scared of conflict in front of her daughter at Wednesday's event with his family, who collected his possessions from the coroner's office in the California city today.

A source told RadarOnline: 'She feels that they all hate her, and that they blame her for Russell's suicide.

'Taylor just wants to get through the memorial on Wednesday.

'She hopes that Russell's family doesn't try and cause a scene.

This is a memorial service for the father of her daughter, Kennedy will be at the service as well.'

The 40-year-old reality television has been staying out of the public eye at a rental house in plush  Bel Air Crest with her daughter since news of her husband's death emerged.

The Mail Online had previously revealed Russell's mother John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the memorial.

Meanwhile Russell's family were picking up the 47-year-old's possessions from the LA coroner's office today.

They looked glum faced as they left with the jewellery and other personal items they had been holding.

Following their appointment they checked paperwork as they sped off in a waiting vehicle.

It has also emerged the broke banker had splurged $60,000 on a 40th birthday party for his wife as he attempted to woo her weeks before his death.

An insider told Celebrity News and Style: 'On the surface both Taylor and Russell looked happy and were all smiles.

'He was very attentive to her, maybe even more than usual and I found that to be a bit odd. He followed her around and was by her side the entire time.'

He spared no expense in throwing the special party at Beachers Madhouse at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, despite the fact he was hugely in debt.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that he invited were co-stars Kyle Richards, who was out of town, Lisa Vanderpump and husband her Ken Todd.

The new developments follow revelations he had slammed Real Housewives bosses in one of the last interviews he conducted.

He said: 'Everything you see on that show is bull****. 'Those Bravo b*****ds take every little argument out of context and magnify it for the cameras.'

'That's not me': Armstrong said of his onscreen portrayal, 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords'

Speaking exclusivity to TheFix.com Armstrong added: 'The Russell you see on TV has nothing to do with my real personality.

'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords. That's not me you see up there. It's just a character I play on TV.'

Last week Armstrong's 69-year-old mother John Ann Hotchkiss threatened the network with legal action if they proceed with plans to air footage of her son.

She told Headline News: 'Before the new 
season even started, before he took his life, he said, "Mom, they’re 
just going to crucify me this season".'

'He said, "I don’t know what to do. I’ll never survive it".'

She has also said that the TV network: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!'

action: Armstrong's mother has threatened Bravo not to show any footage
of her son in the upcoming season of Real Housewives

During his TheFix.com interview, the businessman appeared to change his tune at one point. 'At first I was a little annoyed about all the bull****, but then I realised it's not so bad to be a celebrity,' he said. 'The thing is, all the publicity has been great for my business.'

Armstrong's statement is contrary to the widespread reports that he was in hot water financially at the time of his death.

In the interview Russell also appeared to deny the highly-publicised rift with his wife Taylor, whom he was estranged from.

'She is the most sensitive, sweet woman I've ever met. Taylor's kind of like an angel,' he told TheFix.com. 'She really is everything to me.

'We watch these stories about our terrible marriage, and we lie in bed and laugh. The truth is we are really, really happy.'

Representatives for Bravo are yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on Armstrong's claims.

Armstrong was found dead last Monday after hanging himself at a home he was staying at on Mulholland Drive.

The Mail Online revealed on Saturday that John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the planned memorial service for her son in LA this Wednesday  after tension with Taylor Armstrong boiled over.

Instead she will remember her son at a 
separate memorial service, which is due to be held next week as well, in
either Evergreen or Benton, Texas, just outside of Houston.

Meanwhile, sources close to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast have claimed that Taylor failed to go to the police over her husband's alleged abuse because she wanted to protect their daughter Kennedy.

'She said that she didn't want Kennedy to know and she knew that Russell would never harm their daughter,' the source told Radar Online. 

'Kennedy would hear them yelling behind closed doors but she didn't witness any violence.'
