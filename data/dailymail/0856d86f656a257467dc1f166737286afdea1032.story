Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered an aircraft carrier — the USS George H.W. Bush — to move from the northern Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf as President Barack Obama considers possible military options for Iraq.

Hagel's press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement the order will give the president added flexibility if military action is required to protect American lives, citizens and interests in Iraq.

'American naval presence in the Arabian Gulf continues to support our longstanding commitments to the security and stability of the region', Kirby said.

Accompanying the carrier will be the guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun. The ships are expected to complete their move into the Gulf later Saturday.

The ships carry Tomahawk missiles, which could reach Iraq. The Bush is carrying fighter jets that could also easily get to Iraq, where a fast-moving Islamic insurgency called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is gaining territory.

Obama delivered televised remarks on Iraq on Friday.

'We
 will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,' Obama said. 
'But I have asked my national security team to prepare a range of other 
options that could help support Iraq's security forces and I'll be 
reviewing those options in the days ahead.'

Sources told the Guardian on Friday that air strikes are one choice.

'[ISIL] is now across the border,' a Pentagon source told the paper. 'It is possible to take out the head, you've got to take out the heart...everything is being looked at.'

'This is not solely or even primarily a military challenge,' Obama also said in his address. 'Over the past decade, American troops have made extraordinary sacrifices to give Iraqis an opportunity to claim their own future. Unfortunately, Iraqi leaders have been unable to overcometoo often the mistrust and sectarian differences that have long been simmering there - and that's created vulnerabilities within the Iraqi government, as well as their security forces.'

Obama also said that the Iraqi government will 'have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.'

Elsewhere in his speech, Obama said that the US will 'be monitoring the situation in Iraq very carefully over the next several days.'
