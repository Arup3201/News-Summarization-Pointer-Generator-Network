Monster: Jealous Khalid Abdullah, 35, grabbed his victim as she walked to work at 5:30 am. He was driven by jealousy after seeing his girlfriend with another man

A sex attacker who failed in the knifepoint rape of a woman because of his drunken impotence apologised to her and said 'it's my first time'.

Sudan-born Khalid Abdullah cornered a stranger in an alley and held a blade to her neck in a jealousy fuelled assault, sparked by seeing his own girlfriend with another man.

The victim had been walking to work at 5:30am when Abdullah launched the terrifying attack in April this year.

He told the woman, in her 30s, that he 'needed sex' before putting his hand over her mouth and telling her to keep quiet.

But Abdullah, 35, was unable to carry out the rape and told her: 'It’s my first time, I’m sorry.'

He offered the terrified woman his phone and said: 'Call the police, you can call the police, call the police now.'

The woman fled but Abdullah caught her and told her he 'wanted to kill all women' after catching his girlfriend being unfaithful.

She managed to reach her home in Peterborough, and raised the alarm. Abdullah was later identified through CCTV.

He was convicted of attempted rape after a week-long trial at Peterborough Crown Court.

Judge Nic Madge jailed him for eight years and described the attack as 'every woman’s worst nightmare'.

He told him: 'Whether due to the amount you had drunk or for some other reason, you were not successful in having sexual intercourse, clearly that was your intention.

'You did not succeed in penetrating 
her and she did not suffer any physical injuries, but this was an 
absolutely terrifying experience.

'It was every woman’s worst nightmare. The victim was terrified because of your anger and unpredictability.'

Detective
Constable Louise Spinks said: 'Abdullah is clearly a dangerous 
individual and we are pleased he is now behind bars for a significant 
period of time.'
