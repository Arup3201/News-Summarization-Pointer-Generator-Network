Johnathan Szabo, 24, has been jailed on charges he set fire to the Pennsylvania store where he worked

A man has been jailed on charges he set fire to the Pennsylvania discount store where he worked, starting a blaze that did $2 million in damage to a strip mall.

When asked to comment after his arraignment Monday, Johnathan Szabo, of Charleroi, said simply, 'Sorry.'

Rostraver Township police say Szabo worked at the Dollar General store in the Tri-County Plaza. 

They say he picked up a cigarette lighter from a shelf and began setting fire to paper products about 6:45pm Friday.

There were several customers and employees in the store at the time, who all got out safely.

Police said the blaze damaged the structure 'to the point that the roof was in danger of collapsing on emergency personnel.' 

Surrounding businesses also sustained damage as a result of smoke and water and the Tribune Review reports that ten stores in the plaza remained closed for the duration of the night. 

Police say Szabo confessed and even gave a reason for setting the fire, but they declined to disclose it until Szabo's preliminary hearing November 7. 

Online court records don't list an attorney for the 24-year-old.
