Some may question her journalistic integrity - she actually had the audacity to ask Clarence House how dilated the Royal cervix was yesterday - but you can't fault Kay Burley's stamina.

The controversial Sky News anchor has been parked outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington since 8am yesterday, reporting live for the 24-hour rolling news channel to provide the world with updates on the whereabouts of the Royal baby - braving sweltering heat, thunderstorms and some rather eccentric royalists.

And though she may appear more flustered and less rested today than she was yesterday morning, she did manage to nip home and change her clothes - even though some viewers thought she was wearing the same outfit on both days.

Make-up on the move: Sky News anchor Kay Burley applies her make-up outside the Lindo Wing yesterday as the world waits to be updated on the progress of the Royal birth

An orange a day keeps the doctor away? Kay turned up today wearing another orange top, and white trousers instead of black ones

Kay - who admitted 'I did ask a member of the royal household how many centimetres (dilated) she was, but they told me they didn't give that kind of information out' - arrived on the scene yesterday morning wearing a bright orange ruffled silk top.

After filling the channel with updates for over 12 hours - even when absolutely nothing was happening - she finally left our screens,only to return this morning in.... another silky orange top.

Viewers began wondering whether the hard-working presenter had actually been to sleep, which forced Kay to take a time-out from in front of the camera and address her Twitter feed, commenting that she was wearing different tops - from Jaeger and Dorothy Perkins - that just happened to be the same colour.

One tweet from Hayley White read: 'Has @KayBurley been to sleep? She's wearing the same top.'

After pointing out to several individuals that the tops were very slightly different - one had ruffles, one folds - she issued a full statement: 'To clarify this is different blouse to yesterday however I will concede it is a similar colour! What to choose at 4am after two hours sleep.'

Kay had a gruelling day yesterday when the Duchess of Cambridge went into labour at 6am and the reporter was dispatched to the front line to get all the details.

Nothing happened until the arrival of the prince was announced by easel outside Buckingham Palace at 8.30pm - four hours after he was born at 4.24pm.

Yet Kay, who arrived around 8.30am and stayed all day as temperatures soared into the 30s, managed to fill 12 hours with chatter, speaking to crowds gathered outside, many of whom were on the rather eccentric side.Â 

Twitter worry: Tweeters expressed concern over Kay Burley's lack of sleep, but she reassured them she had had some.... two hours
