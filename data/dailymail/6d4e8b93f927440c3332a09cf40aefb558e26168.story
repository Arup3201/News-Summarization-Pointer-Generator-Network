The contractor who oversaw a botched building demolition that killed six people in a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety.

Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Griffin T. Campbell was also charged with risking a catastrophe and criminal conspiracy in addition to the six counts of third-degree murder, six counts of involuntary manslaughter and 13 counts of endangerment.

'It would appear, bluntly, the motive was greed,' Williams said.

In the collapse on the morning of June 4, an unsupported four-story wall crashed down onto a neighboring thrift store, trapping workers and shoppers for 13 hours and killing six people.

Campbell was expected to surrender to detectives Monday afternoon.

'At the center of culpability': Demolition contractor Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with multiple counts of murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment over the June 5 building collapse in Philadelphia. He is accused of 'cutting corners to cut costs'

Destruction: A four-story building being demolished collapsed on the edge of downtown Philadelphia, leaving six people dead. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said on Monday, Nov. 25, 2013, that contractor Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with third-degree murder, as well as manslaughter, in connection with the Market Street collapse

The charges are the first since excavator operator Sean Benschop was charged this summer with six counts of involuntary manslaughter for allegedly operating heavy equipment while high on marijuana and painkillers.

Williams said the collapse remains under investigation but called Campbell the person 'at the center of culpability for the collapse'.

He told reporters that Campbell ignored an architect's warning the night before the collapse to brace the wall.

'The tragic and preventable collapse ... robbed our city of six amazing Philadelphians that perished in the rubble and left an additional 13 wounded,' Williams said.

Campbell alone chose the demolition method, cutting corners to meet a deadline and cut costs, as he was being paid a flat fee, Williams said.

He was also given the right to salvage floor joints and other material, so he pulled the valuable floor joists out first, destabilizing the exterior walls, Williams said.

Trapped: Some of the victims were stuck under the rubble for up to 13 hours. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams on Monday, Nov. 25, 2013 said that contractor Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with third-degree murder, as well as manslaughter, in connection with the collapse

There was also no scaffolding in place to remove an unsupported 40-foot brick wall, which tumbled onto the one-story thrift store, burying the six dead and 13 survivors.

Building owner Richard Basciano was not charged with any crimes Monday, and Williams declined to comment on his fate.

However, the grand jury will continue to hear evidence in the case.

Victim: Mariya Plekan, a twice-widowed 52-year-old, was trapped within the Salvation Army thrift store for 13 hours before rescuers finally heard her screams for help

Basciano's architect, Plato Marinakos, who had secured the demolition permit, testified before the grand jury after he was promised immunity.

Basciano, once dubbed the pornography king of New York's Times Square, owned the three run-down storefronts being razed.

Several lawsuits have been filed against 
Basciano, a commercial developer hoping to redevelop the block, along 
with Campbell, Benschop and others.

The victims' lawyers also accuse the 
city of lax oversight of the demolition process, but the city is 
generally immune from such lawsuits.

One of the victims was the 24-year-old daughter of the city treasurer.

Victim Mariya Plekan, a twice-widowed 52-year-old, was the first person to speak about the awful accident.

A regular Salvation Army, Plekan said she was somewhere in the middle of the store when she heard a loud bang, she told philly.com.

'All of a sudden I heard the noise, and all I had a chance to turn around and look and the roof went down,' Plekan said.

A beam pinned her legs, preventing her from moving, but she kept conscious and could hear rescuers working above her.

'They started to move things around, then I had a hope that . . . they will save me shortly. But it didn't happen,' she said.

'I was screaming, 'Help, help.' But nobody heard me. And I remember everything. . . . heard the barking of the dogs and I was screaming constantly. . . . But there was no help coming.'

For 13 hours she remained stuck in the rubble.

'And then I heard, I don't know when. . . . I heard the dog was barking and coming up. And I started to scream 'Help' again and the dog followed my yell. And the man, I don't know who he is, he said, I heard, that ''There is somebody alive here''. And they started pulling things apart and they pulled me out.'
