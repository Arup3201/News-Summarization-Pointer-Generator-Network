After launching his sporting tournament for wounded soldiers with spectacular ceremony last night, Prince Harry was enthralled in every aspect of the first events of the Invictus Games today.  

But, as disabled servicemen and women competed in athletics events, the royal and his father Prince Charles found themselves distracted by something on his brother's iPhone. 

The fourth-in-line to the throne grimaced and giggled alongside his amused father as the Duke of Cambridge held out his phone in the stands at the Lee Valley Athletics Centre in north London. 

So funny was the image on Prince William's white iPhone, he shared it with another guest who had turned out to watch soldiers from 13 different nations compete in the event. 

While it's not clear what had exactly had the royals in fits of laughter, their high spirits were matched by those of the jovial crowds on the first day of the inspiring tournament.
