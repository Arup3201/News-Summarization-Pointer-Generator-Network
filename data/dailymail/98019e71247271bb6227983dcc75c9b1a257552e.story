Patricia Wilson, pictured, had a brief affair with gardener Jean-Louis Cayrou before telling friends she had broken off the relationship

The French gardener accused of murdering British expat Patricia Wilson a year ago at her dream country house in southwest France is back behind bars.

Jean-Louis Cayrou, who began an affair with Miss Wilson, 58, after her partner returned to the UK, was allowed out of jail with an electronic bracelet when his lawyer appealed in late August.

But yesterday another judge in Montpellier reversed the decision and ordered Cayrou, 51, to be placed back in detention on remand.

The judge said that his detention was necessary in order to protect witnesses and preserve evidence.

No date has been fixed for his trial and Patricia Wilson's body has never been found.

For weeks, Gendarmes scoured fields and woods and divers searched lakes without success.

The prosecution case against Cayrou was based on threats he made against the British woman prior to her disappearance and blood found on objects in the boot of his car which contained her DNA.

A spate of calls he made to her on his mobile phone suddenly ceased just after she disappeared.

In August last year Patricia Wilson had just returned to her home near the village of Vabre-Tizac in the Aveyron department after a trip to the UK.

In the spring Cayrou had allegedly threatened her when she called off the affair and told her that she ‘could not live without him’.

French gendarmes began a search for 
Miss Wilson after a friend visited her house named Les Landes Basses in
August last year and found bloodstains in her living room and on steps 
leading into her picturesque garden.

Prosecutors believe he lay in wait for
her and attacked her at her home after turning off the power and 
enveloping her house in darkness.

Large
quantities of blood were found at the scene inside and outside her 
picturesque home in the heart of rural southwest France.

Jean-Louis Cayrou remains under investigation and is to be fitted with an electronic bracelet to monitor his movements while prosecutors have 48 hours to appeal

Miss Wilson had moved to the village of Vabre-Tizac six years ago. 

The
former advertising executive, from Welwyn Garden City, had reportedly 
sold her property portfolio in Hertfordshire to buy the tumbledown 
cottage to retire with her long-term partner Donald Marcus.

But
neighbours in the village said the keen artist and photographer had 
separated from him after he returned to the UK.

It was after then that she started a 
brief relationship with her gardener.

He
was placed under investigation after blood samples taken from her house
and the boot of his car matched Mrs Wilson’s DNA profile.

A
friend in the UK said at the time of her disappearance that Miss Wilson
and Mr Marcus had sold their houses in Hertfordshire to fund the move 
to France in order to renovate their dream cottage.

Gendarmes
scoured fields and woods around the village and divers searched lakes 
and ponds but never found any trace of the British woman.

She
had told them she had broken off a love affair with Cayrou, who lived 
alone in a small caravan and did gardening work for several British 
expats.
