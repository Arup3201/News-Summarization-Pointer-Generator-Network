Dish of the day at Waitrose yesterday was humble pie – and first in the queue to see it served up must surely have been Delia Smith.

Months after the Queen of TV cookery stopped appearing in TV advertisements and Pippa Middleton was hired as its magazine columnist, the supermarket has decided to reinstate her.

In a U-turn, the grocery giant has asked the much-loved cook to bring her successful online culinary school to its website.

Triumphant return: Delia Smith has been signed up again by Waitrose. The supermarket's customers were annoyed when Pippa Middleton was given a column in the store magazine soon after Delia departed

The move follows anger in the kitchens
of Middle Britain over Waitrose’s decision to drop her from its 
television ad campaign last year, while promoting Miss Middleton.

Customers
saw the decision as a betrayal of a woman who had taught two 
generations to cook and the resulting Twitter storm suggested it was a 
‘gratuitous insult’ to customers, with some threatening a supermarket 
boycott.

Her departure was 
followed by the news that Waitrose had hired the Duchess of Cambridge’s 
sister as the new star columnist for its magazine.

The
news irked many Delia lovers, not least because the 29-year-old’s 
culinary experience seemed limited to enjoying the hospitality at 
celebrity parties and making sushi rolls for her university chums.

Added
to that was the widespread mocking of her Celebrate party planning 
book, which had disastrous sales. 

Pippa was signed as a columnist for Waitrose's monthly magazine Waitrose Kitchen

Yesterday, breathless bosses at 
Waitrose announced their ‘exciting new move’ to work with Delia again.

Her
online cookery school, launched earlier this year, will appear on the 
Waitrose TV section of the supermarket’s website, offering a free video 
library of lessons and techniques from beginner to advanced level.

Waitrose chiefs were positively effervescent yesterday, calling Delia’s 
tutorials the ‘hero of the channel’ and praising her ‘inspiration and 
expertise’.

Waitrose 
marketing director Rupert Thomas said: ‘We have a long and successful 
history of working with Delia and we’re thrilled to be joining forces 
again on the Delia Online Cookery School with Waitrose, which we believe
will be the definitive online tool for cookery tuition.’

Delia, who has sold 21million cookery books, maintained her dignity throughout the controversy.

When it was suggested she might want to prepare one of Pippa’s recipes at home, she simply laughed.

Yesterday, the 72-year-old spoke of her ‘ambition’ to teach anyone who wants to learn to cook.

‘If
you are from nine to 109 you will be able to learn anything from 
boiling an egg to baking a cake – I don’t think you can learn in a 
better way,’ she said.
