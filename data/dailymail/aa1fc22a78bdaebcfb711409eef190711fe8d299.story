Nasa’s $1.1 billion Juno mission was today hurtling on a path to Jupiter after an ear-splitting launch from Florida, marking the start of a new era of exploration at the US space agency.

The pioneering spacecraft roared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station mounted aboard the most powerful Atlas V rocket ever constructed, creating a trail of fire and smoke at the start of its six-year, 1.7 million-mile odyssey as scientists cheered and yelled 'Go Juno!'

Juno, the second in a series of five major unmanned missions to explore the solar system, will help restore public kudos and purpose to Nasa following the retirement of its shuttle fleet, which has left it without a vehicle of its own to send astronauts into space for at least five years.

Nasa launched the spacecraft atop an 
unmanned Atlas V rocket that blasted into a clear midday sky as scientists 
cheered and yelled 'Go Juno!'

The spacecraft will take 5 five years to reach orbit around Jupiter and then spend about one year gathering information on Jupiter' magnetic field, atmosphere and interior

'We were reminded today, in dramatic 
fashion, that Nasa is still open for business and leading the world in 
space exploration,' said Nasa’s chief, Charlie Bolden.

It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth.

No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide, necessary given that Jupiter receives 25 times less sunlight than Earth.

The panels - folded for launch - emanate from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill.

At Jupiter, nearly 500million miles from the sun, Juno's panels will provide 400 watts of power.

In orbit around Earth, these panels would generate 35 times as much power.

'Our future in space exploration is 
bright and holds many such cutting-edge science missions that will help 
us better understand our solar system and an ever-increasing array of 
challenging destinations where humans might travel.'

The project has been ten years in the
making, involving scientists and spacecraft engineers from more than 20
institutions in the US and Europe.

Juno is set to beam back the most 
comprehensive data and close-up images ever gathered from the so-called 
King of the Planets, a giant gas ball so vast that it could swallow 
Earth 1,200 times over.

Astrophysicists believe that by 
understanding the composition and structure of Jupiter, the earliest and
largest of the planets in our solar system, they will be able to piece 
together answers to enticing questions about the origins of the universe
more than 4.5 billion years ago - and how, when and why life on Earth 
began.

'Ignition and lift off of the Atlas V
with Juno, on a trek to Jupiter - a planetary piece of the puzzle on 
the beginning of our solar system,' announced Nasa launch commentator 
George Diller.

Juno blasted off with ear piercing speed, but will
become the 
fastest-travelling man-made object ever as it gets closer to Jupiter, 
drawn in by the planet’s enormous magnetic field, when it will be 
travelling at 160,000mph

Project managers hugged and slapped 
one another with high-fives in celebration of the successful launch. The
20-storey stack lifted off 51 minutes late due to a last-minute ground 
control anomaly, lifting into a clear blue patch of sky and accelerating
from zero to 700mph in just 30 seconds.

It shed its record five solid rocket 
boosters as planned during its high-speed climb to Earth orbit, where it
then 'parked' for half an hour before two burns of its Centaur engine 
turned it on the correct trajectory for Jupiter.

Over the next five years, the 
unmanned vehicle will fly a looping path taking it out past Mars orbit 
and back for a fly-by of the Earth in 2013, when it will use our 
planet’s gravity to slingshot itself further out towards Jupiter. It 
will be powered only by solar energy, making it the furthest-travelled 
spacecraft ever driven by the Sun.

As Juno cartwheels closer to Jupiter,
it will become drawn in by the planet’s enormous magnetic field, which 
stretches 2.6 million miles and is nearly 20,000 times as powerful as 
Earth’s. Travelling at 160,000mph, Juno will become the 
fastest-travelling man-made object ever.

How it will look: Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide. The panels - folded for launch - are here seen emanating from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill

Long journey ahead: It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth

The 11.5ft (3.5metre) probe will get 
closer to Jupiter than any previous mission, making its closest approach
3,100 miles (5,000kms) above the planet’s cloud tops and using its 
suite of nine onboard instruments to peer through them.

If Jupiter was 
the size of a basketball, the equivalent distance would be just 0.8 
centimetres (0.3 inches).

The vehicle is named after the 
goddess Juno, who according to Roman mythology could see through the 
clouds that her husband Jupiter, the kind of the gods – would draw 
around him

So vast and deadly are the radiation 
fields around Jupiter that the spacecraft will be bombarded by the 
equivalent of 100 million dental X-rays as it spends its sixth year in 
space orbiting Jupiter, completing 33 laps of the planet as it measures 
its gravitational and magnetic fields, takes data from its deep 
atmosphere and unlocks the mysteries of the planet’s brilliant auroras –
its northern and southern lights.

Destination: Jupiter as seen by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007

It will also determine whether Jupiter has a solid, rotating core deep within its mass of helium and hydrogen gases.

Juno’s command and data handling box –
the spacecraft’s 'brain' – and other electronic assemblies have been 
encased inside a titanium vault around the size of a large car boot to 
protect them from the immense radiation, which would otherwise wreck 
them.

Maj-Gen Bolden said: 'The largest 
planet in our neighbourhood is about to reveal its secrets, and 
everything Juno finds will help us understand more about the origins and
evolution of our solar system.

'This is exciting stuff. The kind of 
thing that inspires young people to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics. The kind of thing that NASA has
become known for - and the kind of thing we’re going to keep doing for 
decades to come.'
