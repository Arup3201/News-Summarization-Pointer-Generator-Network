Gunners need a second goalkeeper after Lukasz Fabianki's move to Swansea

Reina, 31, spent last season on loan at Napoli

Reina could dislodge Iker Casillas as No 1 in Spain team

Arsenal are considering a £5million move for Liverpool’s Pepe Reina — the Spain goalkeeper Arsene Wenger tried to sign for £20m four years ago.

Wenger needs a second goalkeeper after Lukasz Fabianski moved to Swansea but Reina’s arrival would put current keeper Wojciech Szczesny under huge pressure. Reina would expect to oust him and play in the first team if he were to make the move.

Currently behind Iker Casillas in the Spanish pecking order, Reina could find himself promoted after the 5-1 horror show against Holland in Brazil on Friday night.

Up for grabs: Arsenal are keen to swoop for Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina this summer

The Liverpool keeper spent all last year on loan at Napoli and though Rafa Benitez would be keen to have him back in Serie A next season, Liverpool would prefer him to have a permanent move so they do not have to keep subsidising his wages.

Napoli also have Brazilian keeper Rafael developing well and are keen to spend their budget in other areas.

Wenger tried to sign Reina in 2010 when Arsenal bid £20m but Liverpool refused to sell him at the time.

Reina was a popular figure on Merseyside before he was sent out on loan to Serie A side Napoli

The Spain No 2, who is now 31, would be available for much less than that now, with just two years left on his contract and with Simon Mignolet having established himself as the new No 1 at Liverpool. Arsenal would expect to pay about £5m.

Arsenal also need to sign a new striker and have been quoted £32m to sign Real Madrid’s Alvaro Morata — even though the player only has one more year on his contract. That price tag means Arsenal’s interest has cooled considerably.

Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic is an alternative while Wenger is also looking to sign another midfielder. Borussia Dortmund’s Sven Bender is under consideration.
