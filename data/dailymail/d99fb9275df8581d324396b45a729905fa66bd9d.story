Kirstie Alley was the surprise star as the 12th season kicked off, stunning audiences with a spectacular performance that placed her in second position.

Shake it: The Cheers star impressed the judges with their up-beat Cha Cha which saw Kirstie swing her was around the ballroom

Wow factor: Kirstie Alley stunned the crowd with her performance which scored her a 23 with the judges, putting her in second place

The 60-year-old Cheers actress had previously tweeted about how tough she was finding the rehearsal process.

She admitted she agreed to do the show to help lose an extra 30 to 40 pounds having struggled with her weight for years.

Surprised: Even Kirstie and Maskim appeared stunned as their scores were read out

Before the show: Kirstie was spotted looking nervous just before the show but luckily her dance partner Maskim was on hand to comfort her

So it came as a shock when the curvaceous actress (and eldest competitor this season) and her partner Maskim Chmerkovskiy nailed the exciting and seductive routine.

Kirstie kicked off the fast paced dance by winking and pushing up her ample bosom before sashaying her way around the floor in a tight fitting sequin gown.

The judges loved her and were all visibly stunned by her performance.

'Your foot placement was the best of the night,' Bruno told her excitedly.

'Unbelievable - it had sizzle,' Carrie Ann Inaba told her with Len Wiseman saying, 'It was fun it was cheeky and it made me feel good.'

Taking it seriously: Kirstie has previously voiced her ambition to win the competition

Superbowl winning Pittsburg Steeler Hines Ward received a standing ovation for his flamboyant Cha Cha with Australian dance partner Kym Johnson with Carrie Ann Inaba saying the performance was the: 'sparkliest cha cha.'

'You lit up the stage,' she told them.

'I couldn't take my eyes off your bum,' judge Len Wiseman told him to a cheer.

What a hit: American football star Hines Ward has won a superbowl and now wants to win a mirror ball trophy

Show stopper: Supermodel Petra Nemcova tugged at heart strings as she dedicated her dance to the people of Japan

Judge favourite: Carrie Ann tells the model she has natural grace

Supermodel Petra Nemcova is proving to be the season's princess who tugged on the heart strings of audience members as she recounted her experiences from the 2004 Indonesian tsunami in which she was badly injured. 

Upon hearing of the Japanese Tsunami during rehearsals Petra was overcome with emotion and had to be comforted by her dance partner.

Her waltz, which she dedicated to the people of Japan, impressed the judges with Len Wiseman calling it a 'charming dance,' and Bruno Tolioni saying it was 'a dance of extreme beauty and sophistication.'

Rapper Romeo managed to overcome his fears and put forward an impressive performance with partner Chelsea Hightower.

Romeo said at the beginning of his segment that all he wanted to do was get further than his father, Master P, who competed in the second season of the show and was known for getting the lowest scores ever.

Loosening up: Rapper Romeo earned a modest 19 points from the judges for his Cha Cha with Chelsea Hightower

Swinger: Kendra swished her was around the dancefloor with partner Louis Von Amstel

Former Playboy Playmate and reality star Kendra WIlkinson seemed excited to be taking part and ready to shake her bootie when she met up with partner Louis Van Amstel to begin rehearsals.

Dressed in a short sequinned blue dress the 25-year-old model rocked the dance floor with her performance  and had a huge smile on her face the entire time.

The judges liked it too with Bruno telling her 'you can definitely strut your stuff my darling,' and Carrie telling her, 'I don't think you missed a step.'

She also had some very special support in the audience in the form of her ex-boyfriend and Playboy legend Hugh Hefner accompanied by his fiancé Crystal Harris who both clapped and cheered for the star.

Her husband, American football star Hank Baskett was also in the audience looking proud and impressed with his pint sized wife.

In great spirits: Kendra was her usually bubbly self and the judges loved her giving her 18 points

Famous fans: Kendra's former flame Hugh Hefner and his fiancé Crystal Harris came out to support her

Fun: Former wrestler Chris Jerico and partner Cheryl Burke appeared to be enjoying himself on the dancefloor

Karate Kid star Ralph Macchio was the winner of the night along with his partner Karina Smirnoff who danced the foxtrot. 

The 49-year-old actor, who still looks identical to when he shot the famous film 29 years ago,floated his way round the ballroom and even managed to nail a high kick during the routine.

The audience was bowled over by the elegant performance, as were the judges who had great things to say.

'You are a great stonking hit,' screamed Bruno as he leapt to his feet in excitement.

'That was a great surprise,' Carrie Ann told them before awarding the pair 24 points putting them at the top of the leader board for the first week.

So dashing: Judges love former boxer Sugar Ray Leonard's charming and poised performance

Other stars with notable performances included boxer Sugar Ray Leonard who at 54-years-old is the oldest male competitor of the season.

His foxtrot impressed the judges who called him 'so dashing.'

The most underwhelming performance of the night came from radio host Mike Catherwood who failed to wow the judges with partner Lacey Schwimmer.

The pair received the night's lowest score of 13 for their foxtrot but luckily everyone is free from elimination this week meaning Mike will return to dance another week.

Chat show host Wendy Williams, Disney princess Chelsea Kane and wrestler Chris Jericho all brought in average scores which will put them up for the possibility of elimination next week.

Next week on the show there will also be a performance by Chris Brown.

Nervous: Chat show host Wendy Williams appeared to be holding back her big personality during her cha cha

Graceful: Disney star Chelsea Kane and partner Mark Ballas floated their way through their foxtrot

Funny man can't dance: Radio show host Mike Catherwood was the lowest score of the night with only 13 points
