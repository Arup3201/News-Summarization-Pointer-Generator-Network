Valentine's Day saw Sam Allardyce show his undying love for his favourite Kevin Nolan, and the West Ham captain led his team to a 'shameful' (the word used by keeper Adrian) performance at West Brom in the FA Cup.

Most West Ham fans will tell you the truth – Nolan was at his influential brilliant best leading the Hammers out of the darkness of the Championship. Since then he's been out of his depth, yet still Allardyce's love for Nolan burns strong.

So after a 4-0 defeat and being dumped out of the FA Cup – yet another embarrassing exit after last season's disasters at Nottingham Forest and Manchester City – the West Ham manager blamed injuries, implying his squad isn't big enough (same excuse after last season's FA Cup defeat). This is just two weeks after the transfer window closed.

The Hammers' schedule has been no more taxing than most other clubs. In fact Wednesday's game at Southampton was West Ham's first midweek game for a month. 

Why did Sam's team look so tired and out of sorts? West Brom had also played on Wednesday night yet looked full of energy. Sounds like bad management to me.

When asked after those two Cup shockers last season if he was prepared to apologise to fans, Sam Allardyce replied: 'For what?'

After The Hawthorns horror show chairman David Gold and keeper Adrian both said sorry to fans.

Sam Allardyce's unwillingness to empathise with supporters and his failure to apologise to them are signs of a manager who refuses to engage in the emotional side of the game and has no interest in developing any kind of understanding or relationship with the fans. Sam is only interested in doing the job. And on Saturday he failed miserably at it.

West Ham have improved this season, there have been good signings and some good football. But as I wrote in an article for MailOnline recently, West Ham United is a football club ready to burst on to the big time. That's the direction they want to head in.

They need a manager who shares that ambition, and whose skills reflect the extraordinary salary he's receiving (at the last count Sam was the 13th highest-paid manager in the world, earning more than Joachim Low and Diego Simeone).

What West Ham don't need is a manager who moans about the squad size.

The Hammers are heading to a world-class stadium and they need to go there with a world-class manager. Time for West Ham to let Sam go.
