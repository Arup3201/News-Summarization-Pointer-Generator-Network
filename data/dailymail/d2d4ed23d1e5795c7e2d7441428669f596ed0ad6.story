Australian prime minister Julia Gillard has been ousted as Labour Party leader by her predecessor Kevin Rudd by MPs hoping to avoid a huge defeat in upcoming elections.

The ballot took place three years and two days after Ms Gillard removed Mr Rudd in a similar internal government showdown. It makes him leader of the party, but not prime minister.

Ms Gillard, who had thrown open her job to a leadership ballot in response to reports that supporters of her rival Mr Rudd were gearing up to challenge her, lost by 57 votes to 45.

Mr Rudd will have to demonstrate that
he can command a majority in the House of Representatives before the 
governor-general makes him prime minister. If he cannot, opposition 
leader Tony Abbott could be asked to form a government or the elections 
could be moved up from September to August.

The 55-year-old Queensland Labour MP 
beat British-born Ms Gillard, 51, by 57 votes to 45, a ballot returning 
officer announced, as Labour's popularity slid down the opinion polls 
and Ms Gillard lagged far behind her Liberal opponent as preferred 
leader.

Even while voting was still under way, 
Ms Gillard's supporters had conceded that she would be ousted - in a 
reversal of her own ousting of Mr Rudd in 2010.

Ms Gillard had come under fire this week for posing for a photo shoot which showed her knitting a kangaroo as a gift for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's baby.

Critics described the photos of the former leader, widely regarded as lacking home-making instincts, as 'contrived'.

The former leader, who arrived in Australia from Barry, Glamorgan, with her parents as a five-year-old, is now expected to leave politics.

She had put on a brave face in recent months as Labour's popularity slumped. Many voters said they did not trust her after she promised that there would be no carbon tax under the government she ruled, only to bring in the measure.

While there was no immediate official
announcement that Ms Gillard had lost the ballot of senior Labour party
members, Australia media were reporting within minutes that Mr Rudd had
got his old job back.Born
on a Queensland dairy farm, he was prime minister from 2007 to 2010, 
when he realised he did not have enough support within the party to 
survive his position and he resigned as both prime minister and leader 
of the Labour Party.Ms 
Gillard stepped into the position unopposed. Since then, Mr Rudd's 
supporters have spoken of how he had been stabbed in the back by 
Australia's first female prime minister.

Mr
Rudd is now expected to call a general election in August - a month 
earlier than the September election announced by Ms Gillard.

In
a day of drama in Australian politics, Mr Rudd told reporters that 
people were angry that Labour had been left with little choice other 
than to vote for the Liberal (conservative) opposition, led by Tony 
Abbott.

'What the nation 
needs now is strong proven economic management,' he said, claiming that 
'many, many MPs' had asked him to return to the leadership.

He
said he was going to challenge Miss Gillard for the top job 'for the 
nation's sake', promising that their would be no retribution against MPs
who had shown their support for Ms Gillard.

Recent opinion polls showed that the party 
could face huge losses in elections set for September, but that Mr Rudd 
would be a more popular leader than Ms Gillard.

'I
wouldn't be putting myself forward unless I had a degree of confidence 
about the support of my parliamentary colleagues,' Ms Gillard said ahead
of the ballot.

While 
not mentioning Mr Rudd by name, she said the loser of the ballot should 
quit Parliament at the election. She said it was not right to have a 
'person floating around as the potential alternative prime minister'.

Ms Gillard's announcement followed media reports that a petition was circulating among the 102 Labour Party lawmakers.

A
special party meeting to discuss a leadership ballot would have been 
called if at least 34 lawmakers - 30 per cent - signed that petition, 
but her announcement eliminated that step.Â 

Mr
Rudd's supporters are desperate to have a ballot before Parliament 
rises for the last time on Thursday ahead of elections set for September
14.

Opinion polls suggest Labour could lose about half of its 71 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, where parties form the government.

Mr Rudd had been a popular prime minister who started sliding in the polls when Ms Gillard, his then deputy, challenged him to a leadership ballot three years ago.

He did not contest the ballot when he became aware of the level of Ms Gillard's support and she became prime minister unopposed.

Weeks later, Ms Gillard led Labour to a narrow election victory and formed an unpopular minority government with the support of independent lawmakers and a legislator from the minor Greens party.

In a 2012 ballot, Ms Gillard easily defeated Mr Rudd 71 votes to 31. In February, she threw open her job to a leadership ballot to end leadership speculation, but Mr Rudd refused to challenge and she remained prime minister.

Opposition leader Tony Abbott challenged Ms Gillard on Wednesday to bring forward the election to August 3 because of the new wrangling over leadership.

'Given the paralysis now gripping her government and irreconcilable differences in her party over its leadership, will she bring forward the election date to August 3 and let the people decide who should run our country?' Mr Abbott asked in Parliament.

Before announcing the leadership ballot, Ms Gillard replied that she continued to govern effectively.'I can assure him (Abbott) and I can assure the Australian people that as prime minister I am getting on with the job,' she said.
