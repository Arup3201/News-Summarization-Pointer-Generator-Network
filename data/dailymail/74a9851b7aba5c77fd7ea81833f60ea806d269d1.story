A large cuddly toy left on a grass bank triggered an alert that a large black cat may be on the loose.

Eagle-eyed Marc Peacock-Smith contacted his local paper after spotting what appears to be the outline of a black panther-like creature lying on a grass verge outside Thorpe Wood police station in Longthorpe, Cambridgeshire.

Mr Peacock-Smith, who had just been dropping off his son at nursery, said he had to stop when he saw the 'animal' and take a picture.

He said it thought it was bizarre because it was right outside the police station.

He told the Peterborough Telegraph: 'I was driving along to drop my son off at nursery when I saw what looked like the biggest black cat or panther sat on a verge right outside the police station.

'I stopped my car for a few seconds so I could take a picture on my mobile phone. I didn't get out of my car and I must have been about 10 metres or so away from it. It just sat there. I'm sure other people saw it too.

'My reaction was intrigue more than anything, I just thought it was really odd. I wasn't convinced it was real because it didn't seem to be moving.'

The real thing: But the cuddly toy turned out to be no where near as dangerous as an actual panther

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said officers had received a call on Monday afternoon from someone reporting a Puma walking along a grass verge in Thorpe Road, Longthorpe.

However, the spokesman added that a very large stuffed toy cat had been seen in the same area earlier the same day.

Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, said: 'This looks to me like a large cuddly toy.'

The sighting rekindled speculation about the mythical 'Beast of Bretton' - a large black cat reputedly sighted in Peterborough and most recently spotted on a footpath in Mallard Road, Bretton, by Royal Mail worker Clive Williams in August 2011.

Mr Bamping added: 'There are hundreds, if not thousands of big cat sightings reported in Britain every year - some people are mistaken. Some are clearly not big cats but a large majority either are or go unexplained.'

He said sightings are widespread and occur in every county, fuelled partly by the fact such 'big cats' are able to cover 25km to 35km in one night in search of shelter, food or a mate.

In August last year, there was a reported sighting of a big cat in Gloucester after a local took a blurry picture of a furry black figure sprinting through woodland in Nailsworth.

Months earlier, nearby resident Coryn Memory released footage showing a 6ft-long beast stalking through fields close by.

She claims to have first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in Thrupp, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in July 2009 and says she has seen it five times since.

Carcasses of deer, sheep and wallabies have been found strewn across the county several times last year, with some suggesting it lends credence to the theory a big cat is on the loose.

Another famous case was that of the 'Essex Lion ' after holidaymakers at caravan park nesr Clacton in Essex claimed to have spotted a lion in nearby fields.

The culprit was believed to be a three-year-old moggie called Teddy Bear, owned by Ginny Murphy, who said he does look quite lion-like.

A Maine Coon, which is the largest domestic cat breed and can weigh up to 25lb, Teddy Bear lives near the caravan park and likes wandering around in the field where witnesses claimed they'd seen the lion.
