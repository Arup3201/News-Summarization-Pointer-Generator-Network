Misfiring striker Roberto Soldado added another blooper to his personal show reel when he wasted a chance to open the scoring in Tottenham's 2-0 Europa League defeat by Fiorentina.

The 29-year-old's showed how low his confidence has fallen when he was sent clear through during the opening exchanges of the last 32 second-leg clash - but opted to play a tame pass to Nacer Chadli instead of attempting a shot.

Soldado was also guilty of wasting an even better opportunity earlier in the season when he contrived to miss from six-yards in Tottenham's 4-2 FA Cup third round replay over Burnley.

At the time, manager Mauricio Pochettino said that the forward 'did not need to apologise', although those sentiments may change now that Spurs are no longer in the competition - courtesy of goals from Mario Gomez and Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah.

Although the Spain international netted in the 1-1 first-leg draw at White Hart Lane, he has only managed to score five goals in all competitions this campaign while being supplanted by youngster Harry Kane as the team's first choice striker.

Tottenham will remain in Florence for an extra night to ensure they are as fresh as possible for Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, where Soldado is unlikely to be leading the line again.
