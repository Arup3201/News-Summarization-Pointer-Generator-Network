Barcelona went into Wednesday night's clash with Paris St Germain needing to show some warrior spirit - but Gerard Pique may have taken things too far.

The Catalan club managed to beat the French champions to secure top spot in their Champions League group, and their centre back seemed to have taken special measures in his preparation.

Pique arrived at the Nou Camp wearing a bizarre sweater, complete with a hood, which made him look like a medieval knight.
