A teenager has disappeared after she left home to walk the half mile to the school bus stop last week.

Police were hunting for Sierra Lamar, 15, who was last seen by her mother when she left her house at 6am on Friday.

Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies 
were searching the area in Morgan Hill, California with dogs, teams of volunteers and a helicopter but have so far found no trace of the missing girl. 

Her father issued an emotional appeal for her to return, saying: 'Come home, baby, please come home. You're not in trouble. Everyone wants to see you.'

Search: Both the teen's cell phone and laptop are now undergoing forensic studies for any further clues

Miss Lamar is 5ft 2inches, slim, with long dark hair and was last seen carrying a black and pink bag made by Juicy.

Her mother Marlene Lamar said that she has not seen her daughter since waving her off to Sobrato High School early on Friday morning.

Mrs Lamar also told KTVU her daughter walks to a school bus stop but did not get on that day, according to the driver and other students.

She added that her when she called her daughter's cell phone, it went straight to voicemail.

Miss Lamar's phone was found in a field a mile from the family home on Sunday after police tracked it down using electronic signals.

Miss Lamar's friends have been unable to help police with her whereabouts.

'I hung out with her last week and she was happy, her best friend Channah Foreman told KTVU.

'We celebrated my birthday. We don't understand 
what's going on. It doesn't make sense.'

Authorities said there was no indication she planned to run away, unlike in the cases of most fugitive children.

Her sister Danielle claimed that Sierra would never abandon her loved ones, saying: 'She's always in contact with family and friends. She wouldn't leave everyone out of the loop.'

Police told the San Jose Mercury News
 yesterday that Miss Lamar did not appear to have a troubled home life 
and no witnesses have reported anything suspicious from the time or 
location of her disappearance.

Anyone with information as to the girl's whereabouts was asked to contact the Santa Clara police department on 408-299-2311.
