Thousands of runners are preparing to take part in the Boston Marathon today amid tightened security following the double bombings at last year's race that killed three people and injured 260.

A higher police presence, runners using clear plastic bags for their belongings, and fans near the finish line being encouraged to leave strollers and backpacks behind are just a few of the tightened security measures.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said although there have been no specific threats against the race 'we're not taking that as a sign to sort of stand down'.

About 36,000 
runners have registered for the race - the second-largest field in its 
history, many of them coming to show support for the event and the city 
that was shocked by the attack on its signature sporting event.

Race organizers expanded the field from its recent cap of 27,000 to make room for more than 5,000 runners who were still on the course at the time of the explosions

Race
 organizers expanded the field from its recent cap of 27,000 to make 
room for more than 5,000 runners who were still on the course at the 
time of the explosions, for friends and relatives of the victims and for
 those who made the case that they were 'profoundly impacted' by the 
attack.

For
 years, state and local officials have conducted a 'tabletop exercise' 
before the Boston Marathon, a meeting that allows them to study a map of
 the 26.2-mile course and plan for emergencies that could arise during 
the race.

So
 many new people needed to attend the session this year that they moved 
it from the state's emergency bunker in Framingham to the a convention 
center in the city.

One million people are expected to line the route in a show of defiance and to honor the victims and survivors of the attacks which killed three people and wounded more than 260.

The
 crowd grew from what usually is about 100 to more than 450, according 
to Boston Athletic Association executive director Tom Grilk, who is in 
charge of organizing the race.

'Whether
 you have a small group or a big group, the spirit is the same,' he said
 this month in an interview at the athletic association's office, about 
two blocks from the finish line. 'And that is: How do we get our event 
done well?'

For the 118th edition of the world's oldest annual marathon, security along the course will be tighter than ever.

'There'll be considerably more police 
presence,' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said on CBS' 'Face the 
Nation' on Sunday.

'But we also don't want to have it, you know, kind of
 a race through a militarized zone. So it's about striking a balance, 
and I think we have struck that balance.'

More
 than 100 cameras have been installed along the route in Boston, and 50 
or so 'observation points' will be set up around the finish line 'to 
monitor the crowd,' the Boston Athletic Association said.

Lelisa
 Desisa of Ethiopia and Kenya's Rita Jeptoo, who crossed the finish line
 on Boylston Street about three hours before the explosions, will return
 to defend their championships.

Desisa returned to Boston last fall to donate his first-place medal to the city as a gesture of support. Jeptoo, who also won the race in 2006, said she is hoping for a third victory - and one she can enjoy.

'It was very difficult to be happy. People were injured and children died,' she said of last year's marathon.

'If I'm going to win again, I hope I can be happier and to show people, like I was supposed to last year.'

Yesterday marathon
 runners were blessed at an emotional church service that celebrated 
Easter and remembered the victims, while heightened security measures, 
including bag checks, were in place at marathon events.

'It's
 different, coming back,' said Gisele Goldstein, 55, of Germantown, 
Tenn., who planned to run her 12th Boston Marathon this year. 'It's not 
just me-there's a sadness.'

Her friend Nanette
 Farris, 46, of Memphis, added that people were surprised she wanted to 
return for her second Boston Marathon. The doubters were all 
non-runners, however-the runners she knew felt differently.

'If
 you're a runner, you want to show them-no one's going to take that away
 from us,' Farris said. 'Once this occurred, everyone wanted to qualify 
for Boston.'

Last year two pressure cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others

Still, there have been tense 
moments - such as when an alarm went off on Friday, during the Runners' 
Expo at the Hynes Convention Center.

People were spooked, Goldstein 
said, even though it turned out to have been a test.

Ricardo
 Corral, 53, of New York, who planned to race in the hand-cycle division
 of the wheelchair race on Monday-his eighth marathon-said he was 
reassured by the heightened security.

'We are not nervous,' he said. 'We know the police will be here to protect people.'

Corral
 added that it was especially important to him and his teammates to 
return this year, to support Boston and each other. 'As the signs say, 
`Boston Strong,'" he said. 'That's why we come back.'

Only hours after the bombings, people were pleading for an entry into the 
2014 Boston Marathon. For months the calls and emails continued, runners
 begging for an opportunity to cross the finish line on Boylston Street 
and convinced it would ease at least some of their grief.

'They'd
 say, `I'm not a qualified runner; I don't think I ever will be. I 
train. I run. I could do it. But because of what happened last year, I 
need to run,'' Boston Athletic Association executive director Tom Grilk 
said last week.

'It might have been because 
they were present at the finish, or they knew somebody who was working 
or was affected. They might have been somebody who lives in Haverhill, 
Mass., and they were watching the race and it hit `em hard. That was 
true for a lot of people.

'And we received some of these communications and we thought, `What do we do?''

The
 B.A.A. had already expanded this year's field to include more than 
5,000 runners who were stranded on the course when the two explosions 
killed three and wounded 264 others.

A few extra invitations were 
sprinkled among the first-responders and the victims, or their families;
 others went to charities and the towns along the route; some who said 
they were personally touched by the tragedy were already given bibs.

But
 organizers felt they might still be missing people, people who perhaps 
didn't think their trauma was worthy amid all the lost limbs and 
physical scars.

So, in November, they announced that about 500 bibs 
would be available for those 'personally and profoundly impacted by the 
events of April 15, 2013.'

In 250-word essays 
submitted over the website, 1,199 would-be runners made their case. 
Almost 600 had the connection the B.A.A. was looking for.

'The
 anger, guilt and heartbreak I still feel today will never go away,' 
wrote Kate Plourd, who was in the medical tent, dehydrated and vowing 
never to run Boston again, when she heard the announcements: 'Explosions
 at the finish line. Casualties. Dismemberments. Prepare yourself to 
treat the victims.'

'Running the 2014 Boston 
Marathon will help me heal my mind,' she said in the essay that landed 
her bib No. 28115. 'I'll push myself ... to finish the 2014 Boston 
Marathon in honor of those who won't ever give up, who I won't ever 
forget.'

That
 determination was echoed by many runners, including Scott Johnson, 54, 
of Atlanta. He is the executive director of the Scott Rigsby Foundation,
 a nonprofit that supports people who have lost limbs.

The organization 
has raised money for last year's bombing victims, and this year Johnson 
was planning to run with Team MR8, a team formed in honor of Martin 
Richard, the 8-year-old Dorchester boy who was killed in the 2013 
bombing.

'There's a sense of resiliency,' 
Johnson said. 'It's sadness, but it's also a kind of fortitude. Two 
people created the violence, but millions counter it with love and 
support. I like those odds!'

Ben Rancourt, 64,
 of Ste-Germaine, Quebec, was planning to run his eighth Boston Marathon
 on Monday along with his three younger brothers.

'We're
 going to buy beer for the after party!' he said. 'We'll see, tomorrow, 
with the fans on both sides of the road-it will feel very great!'
