Brady Brunch star Barry Williams has been accused of abandoning his three-year-old daughter and leaving his girlfriend of seven years 'homeless and destitute'.

Elizabeth Kennedy says the actor, who played Greg Brady in the ABC series, only spent eight hours with his daughter throughout 2014 and allowed them to be evicted two weeks before Christmas.

The 60-year-old left his ex-girlfriend in 2011 and moved from Hollywood to Branson, Missouri, to pursue a career in entertainment.

His flagging stage career is now the subject of his own reality series: 'A Very Barry Branson'.

In court papers seen by Inside Edition, Williams says Kennedy got pregnant on purpose when he refused to marry her and insists she was nothing more than a 'sexual companion'. 

In a recent interview with Huffington Post, he described her as a 'playmate'.

A devastated Kennedy told Inside Edition's Jim Moret: 'It's the most hurtful thing that anybody's ever done.'

He then asks her: 'If you could say anything, what would you say to him?' She replied: 'That he should be ashamed of himself.'

A source close to Williams told the program the star thinks the claims are nonsense. 

In a Huffington Post interview on February 5, Williams described his time on the Brady Bunch and caused controversy when he suggested he would consider going transgender for publicity. 

He said: 'We don't have time for all of that rigamarole and sorting it out. I want to find out if Bruce Jenner is going to become a woman or not.

'That guy is committed. He is committed to promoting himself. And I'm thinking, maybe, I don't know, I could say - I'm just saying, if this thing doesn't work, and the series isn't doing as well as I want, I'm going transgender.'  

The sitcom originally aired from September 26, 1969, and finished on March 8, 1974, on ABC.

He was married to Diane Martin between 1990 and 1992 before he tied the knot with Eila Mary Matt. The pair had had a child, Brandon Eric Williams in 2004, but split a year later.

Following the cancellation of The Brady Bunch in 1974, Williams continued to appear in guest roles on television, and became involved in musical theater, touring with productions such as Grease, The Sound of Music, and West Side Story.
