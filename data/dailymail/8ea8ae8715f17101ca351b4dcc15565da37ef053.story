Celtic captain Scott Brown declared his furious team-mates ready to ram taunts from Legia Warsaw players down their throats to secure a Champions League lifeline.

The Parkhead skipper missed last week’s first-leg defeat in the Polish capital through long-term injury but was left incensed by the antics of the Poles as they goaded their Scottish opponents at the end of the shock 4-1 win.

For Brown, the incident reminded him of the antics of Shakhter Karagandy after Celtic’s 2-0 Champions League qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan last season. Spurred on by such ‘disrespect’ in the first leg, Celtic duly won the return in Glasgow 3-0 to progress on aggregate, with Brown booked for celebrating in the face of Kazakh keeper Aleksandr Mokin at full-time.

Now the 29-year-old Scotland skipper expects his side to ease the pressure on under-fire boss Ronny Deila by ensuring the Poles face a similar backlash at Murrayfield tomorrow night.

‘The Legia players got a bit  over-confident and celebrated in our boys’ faces — our lads will remember every single thing,’ vowed Brown.

‘The lads will be thinking about that as soon as they go into the game. They will want to be the ones doing the celebrating at  full-time.

‘Last year, it was similar against Karagandy, and it was such a great night when we went through. It was one of those nights people think only happen in fairytales.

‘But we turned it around that night after getting battered over there — and it’s pretty much the same squad of players we have just now.

‘Yes, we have a lot to do in the second leg and it will be hard, but they are not the best team in the world — and everyone is due a bad result.

‘We had ours last week. I have faith in the lads that they can turn it around.’

Yet pressure is mounting on Deila even this early in his reign and Parkhead legend Frank McAvennie fears the new boss was chosen to succeed Neil Lennon solely because he is willing to be manipulated by the club’s directors.

McAvennie, part of the Hoops’ double-winning centenary side in 1988, also criticised the board for playing tomorrow night’s crucial qualifier at the home of Scottish rugby, claiming that their chances of overturning the 4-1 first leg deficit would have been greater at Celtic Park.

‘I hope he is not the puppet some people say he is but I fear he might be,’ said McAvennie.

‘What manager comes into a club and is told who his right-hand man will be? It doesn’t work that way.

‘I played with (assistant manager) John Collins and we get on well — but he is a strong character.

‘If Ronny isn’t strong, John will take over.

‘No one had ever heard of this guy but maybe (chief executive) Peter Lawwell didn’t expect to go through and he has got someone to point the blame at.

‘Roy Keane knocked the job back because of the budget but also because he wouldn’t be allowed to bring his own team in.

‘Roy would have attracted more players on a reduced budget than Ronny will.

‘He will be shopping in the bargain basement because he doesn’t know anything else. Lenny tried to get a few players and never got them.

‘You can’t keep selling top players and not replace them. Eventually, you will come a cropper.

‘Hopefully, I am wrong — but they could get beaten again on Wednesday.’

Frank McAvennie was speaking as the Bauer Group announced a deal with the Scottish Professional Football League for weekly live commentary on numerous games across Clyde 2, Forth 2, Northsound 2, Tay AM, MFR 2 and West Sound.
