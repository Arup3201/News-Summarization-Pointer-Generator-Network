A 'disco clam' has been caught on camera partying on the ocean floor near Wakatobi in Indonesia.

It can be seen rolling the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc's body - and producing a strobe-light effect.

Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley are now trying to find out what this means.

The disco clam produces a strobe-light effect by rolling its top lip and reflecting blue light

Lindsey Dougherty from the University discovered that the clams still roll and curl the edge of their mantles at night, when there isn’t any light to reflect.

‘This means there may be some purpose to the movement of the mantle which isn't seen in other closely related species,’ she says.

The strobe-light effect is produced when the clam rolls the edge of its mantle to expose a row of reflective cells.

When the clams are in a bright area of 
the ocean these cells reflect the light, making it look like the its
 coming directly from the clam.

The clams mainly reflect blue light, which can be seen further away in the ocean than other light wavelengths.

Her team is now looking at all the possible reasons why.

The glowing clams are filter feeders, which mean they eat by straining matter and food particles from the ocean water through an internal filter.

Researchers have therefore ruled out that the reason for the display is to attract food.

Lindsey Dougherty's team also thinks it’s unlikely the display is used to ward off predators because it hasn’t found anything toxic or dangerous in the mantle or the light.

Instead, they believe it could be a mating call used by female clams to attract a mate.

Although, Dougherty believes that the clams might even be hermaphrodites, ‘We think the clams might start out as small males and mature into large females, but we have yet to confirm this.’
