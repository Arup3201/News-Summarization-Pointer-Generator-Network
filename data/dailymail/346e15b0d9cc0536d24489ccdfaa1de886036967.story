Flood alerts have been issued across a swathe of Britain after today's summer sun gave way to thunder storms and downpours across the country.

Residents of the North East, the Midlands and the South East have all been warned to prepare for possible flooding after the heavens opened this evening.

Dramatic pictures showed heavy clouds hanging over the skies of Lincolnshire and Derbyshire, blocking out the late evening sun and turning roads into rivers.

Forecasters had warned that today's 
weather would be a game of two halves, with most of the country basking 
in sweltering temperatures before an onslaught of thunderstorms and 
downpours.

In the second 
severe weather warning by the Met Office in seven days, forecasters 
predict a sweep of hail, gusting winds and floods to start tonight. By Thursday, patches of the country will be back to dry, clear and warm conditions.

Around 0.8in (20mm) of rain fell in some areas with Nottingham receiving a downpour of large hail stones, damaging some cars.

A yellow 'be aware' weather warning has been issued by the Met Office for the east of England.

In particular, Yorkshire and Humber, the East and West Midlands, the East of England and London and south east England.

The warnings, in force until 8pm tonight, mean there is a moderate risk of some damage to infrastructure and local disruption.

A Met Office spokeswoman stressed that the majority of areas would see less than 20mm rainfall.

Warning: The Met Office insists gale-force winds are imminent despite last week's forecast for severe rainfall turning out to be misplaced. The gloomy skies over Ashbourne, Derbyshire are an indication of things to come

'It is not going to be uniform, we are 
looking at thundery showers within that area. Some places will get 
lighter rain and not see any thunder or hail,' she said.

'What we are getting is fairly typical weather for early summer. From midweek onwards we are looking at sunny spells and fairly dry for most of the country with generally dry, cloudy conditions in the West.

'It is a mixture of sunshine and patchy cloud. There will be a little rainfall here and there but it will be fairly dry for the rest of the week.'

Temperatures will be slightly lower than at the weekend with a highest temperatures predicted of 19C for Leeds, 20C for Southampton, 17C for Plymouth and 21C for Bristol.

St James’s Park and Kew in London are forecast to register temperatures as high as 24C. This compares to a high yesterday of 25.4C for Gravesend in Kent.

The fresh storm prediction comes after the Met Office issued a severe weather warning last week for Saturday with forecasts of heavy, thundery rain battering parts of England, Wales and southern Scotland.

But fears that some places could see flooding and an entire month’s rainfall in just one hour turned out to be misplaced, with Britain spared the worst as the summer storms swept the country.

The heaviest downpour was registered in Santon Downham, Suffolk, which saw 0.7in (18.2mm) fall in one hour, followed by 0.6in (16.4mm) falling in Bickley, Worcestershire.

It fell well short of the 1.2in (30mm) - almost half of the UK monthly average for the whole of June of 2.9in (73.4mm) - which had been forecast as a possibility.

Last month the Shard in London - western Europe’s tallest building - was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm.

A landmark study by the Met Office and Newcastle University published earlier this week warned that climate change could result in heavier summer rainfall in Britain, which in turn could increase the risk of flash flooding.
