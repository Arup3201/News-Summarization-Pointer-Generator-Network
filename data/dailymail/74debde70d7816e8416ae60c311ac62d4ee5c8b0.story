Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz has revealed he would love to face former club Chelsea in the Champions League final this season.

The Brazilian, 27, signed for the Ligue 1 champions in a £50million deal last summer, and his side face Barcelona in the Nou Camp on Wednesday night in a decider to top Group F.

And Luiz hopes PSG can claim their maiden European Cup, in a final that would be hotly contested with Jose Mourinho's impressive Blues.

'I want PSG to win the Champions League,' Luiz told reporters.

'Chelsea are having a very good season with very good players. I hope to play against them in the final, it would be amazing!'

Luiz's departure from west London saw him become the most expensive defender in history, while Gary Cahill and John Terry have solidified the Chelsea defence.

But he has praised two incoming players at Stamford Bridge, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.

'They proved their class. These are key recruits – with them, the penny dropped and the puzzle is in place. 

'Cesc with his rhythm, his aggressiveness and experience in the Champions League and Diego with his composure in front of goal and its effectiveness – they had an immediate impact.'
