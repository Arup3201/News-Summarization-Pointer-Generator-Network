deliver lectures on human rights law during the current spring
semester.

Lebanese-born Amal Clooney, 37, may have shot into the public eye
as the partner of George Clooney, 53, whom she married in a lavish
Italian ceremony last year, but she has forged a notable career
as an international human rights lawyer.

Among her previous roles she served as an adviser to Kofi Annan in his
role as a United Nations special adviser for Syria.

Clooney also
represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his extradition
proceedings.

She is currently representing jailed Canadian Al Jazeera journalist
Mohamed Fahmy in Egypt, where he was sentenced last year on charges that
include spreading lies to help a terrorist organization.

Just last month she lashed out at the Canadian government, accusing Ottawa of 'woefully inadequate' efforts to secure Fahmy's repatriation

Since January she has been working on recognition of the Armenian Genocide. 

An Oxford graduate, Clooney completed her Masters of Law at New York University and worked in the city at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.

She returned to London in 2010, joining Doughty Street Chambers as a barrister.

She has since lectured on international criminal law at SOAS (University of London), The New School in New York City, The Hague Academy of International Law, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
