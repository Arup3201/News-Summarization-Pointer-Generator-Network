It's the miracle escape that this six-year-old boy didn't even know had happened.

Security camera footage from northeast China captures a little boy squatting down happily in the middle of the street playing with a hammer and pieces of wood.

Then a red SUV slowly drives straight over the top of him - but the boy survives because he's ducked down just far enough to avoid the front of the vehicle.

The unbelievable scene was captured on CCTV footage outside the boy's home in Jining City, Shandong Province.

The boy was squatting down happily playing with what looks like a hammer and pieces of wood near his home in the Shandong Province

The boy and driver seem equally as oblivious that they are about to collide on the quiet side street in Jining City

A red SUV slowly rolls over the little boy who had his back to the vehicle

The shocked child reappears no more than five seconds after the car had driven over him and immediately jumps to his feet while clutching his back and is last seen walking towards his home, SBS reports.

The seemingly oblivious driver continued to drive down the quiet side street unaware that the child was ever there.

The boy miraculously escaped the scary incident with only superficial injuries to his face and legs.

Authorities said the child only survived because of his small size and the positioning between the two front wheels of the car.

The boy's grandfather is reported to have cried when he watched the distressing video which was caught on the streetâ€™s CCTV cameras.

The driver later told police that he didn't notice the child in the middle of the road.

The case is currently under investigation.
