Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wants Saido Berahino to solve his goalscoring problems in January.

The Reds boss has identified the West Brom striker as the man he wants to add goals to his misfiring forward line.

And Rodgers is pushing for a deal to happen when the transfer window reopens in six weeks.

West Brom are desperate to keep Berahino, who has scored eight goals already this season, and will demand a high price.

Berahino could cost in-excess of £15million, while the Baggies will look to keep the striker by offering him an improved contract.

Having spent close to £120million on new talent in the summer, though that was offset by the £75million sale of Luis Suarez, there is doubt over whether Rodgers will be afforded the funds to launch a raid for Berahino.

And if a deal is not possible in January, then Rodgers is expected to return for Berahino in the summer.

Daniel Sturridge is expected to be out for a further six weeks after suffering a fresh injury

West Brom are facing an increasing battle to keep hold of their prized-asset, with Tottenham also keen on the striker.

Bolstering his strikeforce is a priority for Rodgers in January.

Daniel Sturridge is facing another six weeks on the sidelines with a groin problem, £16million signing Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal for the club and Rickie Lambert has started just one league game this season.

Rodgers has admitted the chances of recalling £10million summer signing Divock Origi are slim.

All that has made Rodgers intensify his interest in Berahino, despite WBA’s insistence that they will not sell in January.
