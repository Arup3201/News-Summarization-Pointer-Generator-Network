A Western Australian political staffer has been suspended after he was arrested near his boss' home with a baseball bat, balaclava and latex gloves.

WA Premier Colin Barnett has responded by describing the incident as 'like a Monty Python episode'. 

The deputy clerk of the Legislative Council, Nigel Lake was arrested late at night on February 17. 

He was dressed entirely in black and just one kilometre away the home of his boss Nigel Pratt, who is the Clerk of the Legislative Council.

Lake, 49, was charged with possessing a controlled weapon and a disguise, both intended for use in connection with committing an offence.

Following police investigations, he has also been charged with installing and tracking a device.

Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett believes the incident is completely 'bizarre'.

'It's a bit like a Monty Python episode, isn't it?' he told ABC News. 

Liberal Legislative member Robyn McSweeney has a stronger opinion, describing herself as 'completely appalled' by Lake's actions.

After his arrest, Lake was stood down from his $166,000-a-year role. The Crime and Corruption Commission have been notified of the public official's actions.

In his role, Lake has been responsible for the management of the Department of the Legislative Council.

Legislative Council President Barry House notified all MPs of Lake's arrest and in a letter to staff.

'Upon learning that Mr Lake had been arrested and charged I immediately directed him to remain away from the workplace and to not undertake any work until further notice,' Mr House wrote, according to Perth Now. 

'This was to allow the police to complete their investigation. I consider any behaviour which results in criminal charges being laid against a Parliamentary Officer as very serious.'
