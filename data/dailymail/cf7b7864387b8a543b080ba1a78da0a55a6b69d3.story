'Plum' bonus: CEO Rick Holley refused $1.85million worth of Plum Creek stock

The CEO of a timber management company refused $1.85million worth of stock because he hadn't done enough to deserve the bonus, an SEC filing reported.

Rick Holley, who heads Seattle-based Plum Creek Timber, returned 44,445 shares of company stock, claiming he didn't earn it because shareholders did not enjoy an increase in returns.

Even the board of directors couldn't believe an executive would pass up millions as a matter of conscience.

Holley told Fortune the board  was 'surprised' when he decided to return the bonus.

'I told them I wasn’t asking for their approval. They had given these to me and I appreciated their confidence in me, but I didn’t feel comfortable taking them.'

The numbers, Holley said, just didn't show the strong performance he believed was deserving of a bonus. 

'This has been a year where total shareholder returns are down 10% or more,' he said. 'It just wasn’t the right thing to do.'

Holley likely won't be hurting financially, as the Plum Creek chief took home over $8million in 2013 and still owns stock valued at $11.8million in the company.

The list of executives willing to forgo the extra compensation is short.

In January, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty turned down her 2013 performance bonus after the company's stock dropped for seven straight quarters, the Washington Post reported.

The chief executive at Barclays, Antony Jenkins, turned down his bonus for 2013, the year the bank was forced to raise billions from stockholders to shore up its books.

But the CEO still made off with 1.9million shares of Barclays stock, valued at over $6million at the time, the Guardian reported.

More often, executives are unashamed to take big pay packages. 

The New York Times reported JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon took home $10million in stock for his bonus for 2012, the year the financial giant lost billions during the London Whale scandal - and faced hefty fines.

The next year, the board approved a bump in compensation to $18.5million in restricted stock, over the protests of a small minority of directors. 

The Telegraph reported Nokia CEO Stephen Elop refused to take less than $25million after selling the handset unit to Microsoft, while regular employees were denied bonuses and faced layoffs.

A Securities and Exchange Commission document filed by Plum Creek earlier this month noted Holley's bonus, which would have vested in February 2017, was given 'as incentive for [Holley] to remain in his position as chief executive officer for the next several years.'

The Plum Creek CEO 'elected to return the restricted stock units because he does not believe that he should receive such an award unless Plum Creek’s stockholders see an increase in their investment return.'

'Nonetheless, Mr. Holley remains fully committed to Plum Creek and intends to lead the company through this challenging and prolonged economic cycle,' the filing added.

The document also noted Holley returned the bonus on December 12, when shares opened at just under $42.

Plum Creek, which is also invested in energy and mineral extraction, land development and conservation, is the largest private owner of forestland in the United States.

The AP reports that earlier this month a watchdog group asked the Sustainable Forestry Initiative to investigate Plum Creek's green certification for logging in Oregon's Coast Range.

The complaint by the Center for Sustainable Economy noted the company had four citations for exceeding a 120-acre limit on clear cutting and included evidence of landslides in areas logged by Plum Creek.
