The European Court of Human Rights today  backed the extradition of a paranoid schizophrenic man accused of setting up a jihadist training camp in the United States under orders from Abu Hamza.

Haroon Aswat, 40, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was extradited from Britain to the United States in October after the US government gave assurances about his treatment.

Lawyers for Aswat had said that the assurances, which led the High Court and ECHR to lift a block on his extradition, were 'inadequate' and his removal breached Article 3 - prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment - of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Aswat's extradition was blocked in April 2013 by ECHR judges who ruled that he could face inhumane treatment as there were no guarantees over where he would be detained.

Home Secretary Theresa May was told to put extradition plans on hold after High Court judges heard that Aswat suffered from serious mental illness.

But in September judges at the same court said they were satisfied with assurances given by American officials that he would be cared for, and he was finally extradited in October.

The European Court of Human Rights today formally reversed its decision, saying the move was legal and it was satisfied Aswat was receiving 'appropriate treatment' in the US.

Judges said the case was inadmissible, calling it 'manifestly ill-founded' and upheld the High Court's decision, writing: 'In considering Mr Aswat's specific complaints, the court found that the assurances given by the United States government ensured that Mr Aswat would be given treatment appropriate to his mental health needs.

'The court found that there was no persuasive evidence before it to suggest that he would not receive adequate treatment in the United States to control his mental illness, or that he would be detained in circumstances which would place him at risk of a mental health relapse so as to render his extradition in breach of Article 3.'

Aswat is accused of setting up a training camp in Bly, Oregon in the United States between June 2000 and December 2001 for people wanting to fight in Afghanistan.

Aswat, who was originally arrested in 2005, was held at Broadmoor psychiatric hospital before he was sent to the US.

He is said to have acted under orders from radical British preacher Abu Hamza, who was himself extradited to the US and last year convicted on 11 kidnapping and terrorism charges.

Aswat pleaded not guilty to four counts of conspiracy and providing material support to Al-Qaeda in a New York court in October.

His trial is due to begin in June and he faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.

Aswat was arrested in 2005 in Zambia, extradited to Britain and moved to a psychiatric hospital in 2008 until being sent to the US.

After travelling to Bly, US officials say he spent two months in Seattle living at a mosque where he witnessed men being given additional coaching on how to handle weapons.

They say that documents recovered by FBI agents from a safe house used by 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan listed a number of individuals associated with Al-Qaeda, including Aswat.

Hamza, previously of north London, was jailed for life earlier this month after a jury last year found him guilty of supporting terrorist organisations, including aiding the taking of hostages in Yemen and seeking to set up an al Qaida training camp in the US.
