A loss prevention worker saw him in the store's meat section and told police 'she observed a white male [...] select 5 pieces of rib-eye steak and place them in the seat of a motorized handicapped scooter that he was riding around the store,' according to the report.

'Suspect sat on the steaks and exited the store passing all points of sale, without attempting to pay for said merchandise,' the document said.

Police arrived after the worker, identified in the report as Jackie Jenkins, stopped him and took him into the store's loss prevention office, report said. Officer Adam Bailey talked to Jenkins then arrested Fowler. 

'Due to his size, the suspect was cuffed using two pairs of cuffs,' it said. 'Cuffs were double-locked and checked for fit.'

Fowler was released without bond following approximately three hours in police custody, The Smoking Gun reported.
