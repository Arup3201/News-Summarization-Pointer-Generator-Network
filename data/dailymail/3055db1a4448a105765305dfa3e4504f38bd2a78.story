Arsenal target Raheem Sterling is a more talented player than Gunners star Mesut Ozil, according to Michael Owen.

The former Liverpool forward made the claim before Brendan Rodgers' men lost 4-1 at the Emirates on Saturday - a game in which Ozil netted his side's second goal. 

Owen's opinion drew criticism on social media but the ex-England man has refused to back down, even after Sterling's disappointing display in north London.

BT Sport pundit Owen believes there should not be a debate about whether Sterling is more talented than Ozil

Asked whether Sterling could fit into Arsene Wenger's team before Saturday's game, Owen told BT Sport: 'I would think so, they would find some way.

'He's better than Ozil, I think he's probably better than [Danny] Welbeck.'

But even after watching Ozil shine and Sterling struggle in Arsenal's win against his former club, Owen repeated his claim that the wantaway forward is a superior player. 

Owen wrote on his Sportlobster account: 'It seems my claim that Sterling is a better player than Ozil made some headlines today. Is there a debate? Not even close.'
