Isla Todd has lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues

A three-year-old girl suffers from a rare disease that means going on a summer holiday could kill her.

Isla Todd has lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissue.

It usually affects the arms and legs and can lead to pain and a loss of mobility.

The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues.

In patients such as Isla, the excess fluid will cause the tissue to swell.

Her lower legs are constantly swollen and any cut or infection could be deadly.

This means high temperatures, grazes or insect bites can be fatal, her mother Heather says.

As a result, she and husband Andrew cannot take their daughter on a family holiday to Spain because of the temperature, and Isla isn't allowed to run around in the park like other children.

Secondary lymphoedema is a well-known side effect of chemotherapy, which can damage the lymph nodes.

However Isla, from Glasgow, is thought to be the only child in Scotland born with the condition.

Her mother, 45, said: 'We have to be so careful with Isla so she doesn’t get the slightest knock.

'If we were to go to somewhere like Spain, the temperature increase would increase the swelling in her legs and that would be deadly.

'Also there’s more chance of her being bitten by an insect out there.

'She’s never been barefoot because any slight cut or graze means we have to rush her straight to hospital.

'Whenever she runs around my heart is in my mouth.'

The lymphoedema means Isla's lymphatic system, which helps regulate the body’s immune system, hasn’t fully developed below her knees.

If she is cut, a circle has to be drawn around the mark to monitor the infections growth for cellulitis - a serious bacterial infection.

She also wears protective stockings 
and her mother always carries a first aid kit - complete with 
anti-bacterial medicines and a special pen - in case anything happens.

It took nine months for Isla to be diagnosed - despite her being born two weeks early with severely swollen legs.

Mrs Todd said: 'The nurses panicked as soon as Isla was delivered - they could see something was wrong.

'She was two weeks early but still weighed 9lbs and her feet and legs were really swollen.

'I don’t think anyone had seen it before.'

The University of Glasgow is home of the UK’s longest serving lymphoedema programme and staff there work closely with Isla and her family.

A spokeswoman for the university said: 'We believe Isla is the only child to be born in Scotland with the condition.

'Most of the time people get secondary lymphoedema, but this is usually a result of their lymph nodes being damage from cancer treatment.

Isla's parents are fundraising for the Lymphoedema Support Network to help find a cure.

Lymphoedema is a rare condition that causes 
swelling in the body's tissue. It usually affects the arms and legs and 
can lead to pain and a loss of mobility.

The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues.

Damage means the excess fluid cannot be returned to the circulatory system, causing the tissue to swell.

There are two main types of lymphoedema:

Primary lymphoedema – which develops at birth or shortly after puberty and is caused by faulty genes.

Secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system as a result of an infection, injury, trauma, or cancer.

The latter often develops as a side effect of cancer treatment. 
Surgery is often necessary to remove lymph glands to prevent a cancer 
from spreading, this can damage the lymphatic system.

It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 people are affected by primary lymphoedema.

Secondary lymphoedema is a relatively common condition, affecting an estimated 100,000 people in the UK.
