A couple recruited a 15-year-old girl from a dating website to have a threesome with them as a 'gift' on their wedding day, a court has heard.

Edward Chang, 34, and his wife, Thanaphat Ratanasirivillai, 25 from Longmeadow, Massachusetts allegedly arranged the encounter on OKCupid.com.

The pair, who also met each other on the site, now face multiple charges including rape, assault and battery on a person over 14, and enticement of a child under 16. 

On trial: Thanaphat Ratanasirivillai, 25, (left) and her husband Edward Chang, 25, from Longmeadow, Massachusetts allegedly arranged the encounter with the 15-year-old on OKCupid.com

Suspect: Ratanasirivillai, a Thai national, was a graduate student at Cornell University's management school when she married Chang on December 31, 2012

The alleged tryst that took place at the Red Carpet Inn in West Springfield, Massachusetts, became public after the alleged victim's father discovered evidence of the encounter on her iPhone.

Chang had booked a special jacuzzi room at the venue, but the court heard that he was moved to another after the front desk worker saw he was with two women - as it is against hotel policy. 

According to Mass Live, defense lawyers are expected to argue that the girl was complicit in the alleged encounter, stating that she was 18-years-old on the site. 

Chang, who reportedly works for Nike in Taiwan, faces a 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence because of the age difference between him and the victim.

The couple started searching for a girl for their wedding night by changing their profile name to 'Threeway Cupid', the court heard.   

The alleged victim, now 17, told jurors she has had a longtime interest in acting and modeling, loves the boy band One Direction, and enjoys the 'Harry Potter' and 'Hunger Games' book series. 

She added that she joined OkCupid because she had been struggling to make friends at school and had been bullied because she was skinny and 'just different'. 

The girl then told jurors she met a girl called Pat on the site when she decided she wanted to engage with girls as well as boys. 

Lawyers said that Pat turned out to be Ratanasirivillai, who then persuaded the girl to meet them. 

Michael O. Jennings, a lawyer for Chang, told the jury: 'It's not a website someone uses to troll for youth to have sex with. I believe you'll hear it's a very popular website - because it's free.

'They had an interest in including a third party in a sexual relationship.' 

Assistant District Attorney Clarissa Wright told the court that the trio had exchanged 'racy' messages before the encounter. 

In her opening statement, she said: 'The thing is, she's 15 and she becomes curious.' 

Testimonies will continue on Monday and the trial is set to finish in the middle of next week. 

According to OkCupid's website, it is against their policy for anyone under the age of 18 to become a member.
