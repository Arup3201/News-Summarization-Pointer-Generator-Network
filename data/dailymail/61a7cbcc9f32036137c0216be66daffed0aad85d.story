A former PA was jailed yesterday for being the madam of a 'despicable' gang which trafficked more than 50 Hungarian women to  Britain to work as sex slaves.

Victoria Brown, 25, was from a respectable family but became the 'logistical organiser' in the gang, which made £20,000 a week from prostitutes holed up in hotels, brothels and even a university halls of residence.

Brown organised flights, booked hotel rooms, collected money and took victims' passports.

Mate Puskas and Victoria Brown, a former couple in the gang that organised the trafficking of young women and forced them to work as prostitutes in brothels across the UK

Women as young as 17 were flown to 
Britain on EasyJet and Wizz Air flights and forced to have sex with up 
to 15 men a day.

Many were recruited from deprived parts of Hungary and 
told they would be working in the massage industry.

They
 were put up in hotels around Gatwick, in flats across the South East 
and in Bristol and Norwich as well as in Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and 
Glasgow.

The gang also used a room in a halls of residence at the 
University of Sussex.

Women 
were advertised on sex websites as 'fresh meat' and threatened with 
exposure at home if they fled.

The gang collected £100 an hour but kept 
most of the money for themselves while refusing to hand back passports 
until the women had paid off their 'debts'.

Hove
 Crown Court heard Brown acted as 'loyal lieutenant' to gang ringleader 
Mate Puskas, who was also her boyfriend and the father of her 
21-month-old son.

Jailing 
her for three years yesterday, Judge Richard Hayward told her: 'It is 
very sad to see you in the dock.

'You are intelligent, you come from a 
respectable family, you had a good job, and you threw it all away for 
Mate Puskas.'

He described 
her defence, in which she blamed her crimes on Puskas and said she acted
 under duress, as 'unattractive'.

Her lawyer, Nicholas Hamblin, claimed
 she had performed only 'secretarial activities' and had made no personal gain from the trafficking.

She had taken out loans of £21,000 
under pressure from Puskas and was bankrupt, he said.

Brown
 attended Felpham Community College in Bognor Regis and worked for an 
engineering firm in Brighton before joining the gang.

Last night her 
father Stephen refused to comment from the  £150,000 family home in 
Bognor Regis.

The empire was
 uncovered when a building manager at the University of Sussex received 
an email advertising sex services in March 2011.

He recognised the 
distinctive blue and yellow curtains from the halls of residence and 
uncovered a makeshift brothel on campus in Falmer, East Sussex.

Istvan and Peter Toth, who have been found guilty of exploiting and bullying young girls into prostitution, blackmailing many of the girls and threatening others

The organised crime gang brought at least 44 women into the country over almost two years, setting them up in hotels and flats, including at the University of Sussex campus, and uploading their profiles on to a website which advertised sexual services for sale

Raids were carried out by the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement Criminal Investigations team in order to shut down the sex trafficking operation

The five were jailed for a total of 25 years and the Hungarian nationals are to be deported when they finish their sentence

The
 gang members were convicted on Tuesday and sentenced yesterday after a 
ten-week trial during which victims gave evidence by video link from 
Hungary.

The judge told the gang they had committed a crime that 'society finds repugnant'.

Sentencing Puskas to six years in jail, the judge told him he was 'at the centre of the conspiracy and very much in control'.

Zoltan
 Mohacsi, 36, was jailed for four years. Istvan Toth was sentenced to 
five years and his brother Peter – who was described in court as a 
'gentleman pimp' because of his politeness to some of the victims – for 
four years. Both are on the run after breaking bail.

Security
 Minister James Brokenshire said: 'This is an appalling case where an 
organised criminal gang has traded in human misery in order to make a 
profit.

'I am thankful that these criminal slave masters have been stopped and brought to justice.'

A
 spokesman for the University of Sussex said the gang were discovered 
using the two-bedroom flat during the Easter holidays. They gained 
access without the knowledge of the student who had rented it – he was 
away for the break.
