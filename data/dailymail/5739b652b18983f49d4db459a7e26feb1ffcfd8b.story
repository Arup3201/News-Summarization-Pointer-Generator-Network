Nigel Pearson believes that his Leicester stars will catch the attention of their international bosses if they carry on their excellent start to the season for the Foxes.

Striker Jamie Vardy was linked with an England call-up for their Euro 2016 qualifiers this month after his fine start to the season.

Vardy scored in the 5-3 win over Manchester United and Three Lions assistant manager Ray Lewington watched the 27-year-old in the Foxes' 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last week.

And boss Nigel Pearson believes his players will continue to gain recognition if they keep playing well

Vardy, who was playing for Stocksbridge in the eighth tier of English football four years ago, missed out on selection for the games with San Marino and Estonia but, ahead of Saturday's visit of Burnley, Pearson believes rewards will come if his players perform.

'My views on any player who has been linked with international call-ups is that it is pretty positive but if people are still talking about any of our players at the turn of the new year then they have continued to do well,' he said.

'It is easy to get carried away with one or two performances but ultimately it is about players being able to perform consistently for their clubs. If they do that than any speculation regarding their futures at international level will take care of themselves.

'For anyone to be linked with an international is a positive, although I wonder where the speculation is generated.

'But whoever is linked in such a way needs to keep their focus on their own performances at club level week in and week out. If they do that then if they are good enough they will get selected at some point.'
