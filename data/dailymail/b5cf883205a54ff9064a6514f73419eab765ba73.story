KitKats are extremely popular in Japan, where they are considered a good luck charm because of their name: in Japanese it sounds like kitto katsu, which translates as 'you will surely win'.

The brand has more flavours in Japan than anywhere else, even America, and other flavours include Kobe pudding, rum raisin, wine, passion fruit, lemon cheesecake, and brandy and orange.

KitKats were invented by Britain's Rowntree confectionery company in 1935, but until 1937 were called the Chocolate Crisp.
