Never has the saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' been more fitting than when a jilted wife in China chopped off her cheating husband's penis... twice.

When Feng Lung, 30, discovered her husband was having an affair she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it.

She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm.

Two-timing dad-of-five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's mobile to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu in central China's Henan province.

But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis.  

Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital. 

A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.'

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.'

Fan's lover, who visited him at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

'It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,' Zhang said.

Feng was discharged and is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm.
