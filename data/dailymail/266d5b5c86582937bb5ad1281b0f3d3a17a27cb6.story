'Targeted': Haresh Sood, 35, says racist notes were left for him shortly before he was axed from his post

A model turned teacher is suing a Catholic school for more than £100,000 after claiming he was subjected to a torrent of racist abuse from pupils and staff.

The languages teacher says a  scribbled drawing of his face captioned ‘Farewell Bollywog!’ was left for him in his staff pigeonhole shortly before he was axed from his post.

Haresh Sood, who was once named one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors, said he was left another note which read ‘Good Riddance Turbanator!’.

The 35-year-old, who is British born but of Indian origin, also says his school register was torn and national flag removed from his classroom and dirtied.

He alleges that some pupils at Nottingham’s Christ the King School called him a number of offensive racist names as well as ‘vindaloo’ and ‘chicken curry’.

Mr Sood, who at the time was wearing  his hair in a distinctive Afro-like style, says a colleague at the Catholic secondary school told him to shave an Indian flag into his hair and called him a ‘t***’.

In paperwork lodged with an employment tribunal, Mr Sood claims school chiefs called a staff meeting and demanded the ‘gutless wonder’ responsible own up.

When no one came forward, they  compared handwriting samples from  all staff and called in police, but the  culprit was never caught.

Mr Sood, from Nottingham, says he was made redundant from his £22,000-a-year post in August 2008 after complaining about the harassment.

He is suing the 700-pupil school for race discrimination, harassment, unfair dismissal and victimisation.

He is seeking more than £100,000 in compensation for lost earnings, aggravated damages and injury to feelings.

In 2003 he was featured by  New Woman magazine as one of Britain’s top 20 ‘hottest single men’.

Mr Sood, who joined Christ  the King School in 2006, made the allegations during pre- liminary legal arguments at  Nottingham employment tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

The case has been mired in legal argument as Nottinghamshire County Council has attempted to have many of the 100-plus allegations struck out.

Mr Sood claims he suffered racist abuse from children in May 2008 and said the school failed to deal with it.

When the ‘Bollywog’ note appeared, he said he was humiliated as his boss called a staff meeting and ‘read out a passage about “wogs” not being allowed on buses in the 60s’, before inviting the ‘gutless wonder’ responsible to own up.

Three days later, the second note appeared. Mr Sood, who was most recently working as a legal consultant specialising in employment law, told the appeal tribunal: ‘Other members of staff would not have been subjected to treatment of this nature or, if they had been, the problem would have been treated as a serious matter.’

Mr Sood, a University of  Leicester law graduate, then joined Rushcliffe School, in  Nottingham as a sixth-form  law teacher.   

He was made redundant in 2010 and sued unsuccessfully for unfair dismissal.

Christ the King School denies the claims and is contesting the case, due at Nottingham employment tribunal later this year.

The spokesman said the authority was now seeking to ‘recover taxpayers’ money’ spent on defending the allegations from Mr Sood.

Mr Sood and Christ the King School declined to comment.

A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire County Council said: 'Currently Mr Sood has a number of current claims against his former school, Christ the King School which have been ongoing since 2008 and it would not be appropriate to comment on these claims at this stage.

'However, in addition to the these claims, Mr Sood has previously issued proceedings against another former school, Rushcliffe Comprehensive School, as well as Nottinghamshire County Council separately.

'Mr Sood's claim against Rushcliffe School for unfair dismissal and victimisation was heard by a full Employment Tribunal in June of this year after which all of Mr Sood's claims were dismissed by the Employment Tribunal as groundless.

'Employment Judge Hutchinson made findings that despite Mr Sood having been legally trained and an expert in employment law, Mr Sood had "sought to wilfully mislead the Tribunal" over his claims. Nottinghamshire County Council is seeking to recover taxpayers' money directly from Mr Sood which has been spent on defending these proceedings.

'In respect of Mr Sood's claim against Nottinghamshire County Council, this claim has since been withdrawn by Mr Sood and Nottinghamshire County Council is also pursuing its costs in that case.'
