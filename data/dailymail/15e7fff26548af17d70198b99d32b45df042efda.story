A ‘despicable’ thief stole a retired banker’s bicycle as he was drowning in a canal.

Michael Houghton, 51, was face down in the water when Adam Lowther, 22, came along the towpath.

Instead of rescuing the unconscious father of three or calling for help, Lowther picked up his mountain bike and rode off on it.

The thief told police he assumed Mr 
Houghton was already dead. In fact, he was still alive and might have 
been saved had Lowther alerted emergency services.

Mr Houghton was eventually pulled from the canal in Leeds by two passers-by, but he died in hospital three days later.

Jobless Lowther, meanwhile, sold the 
bike for £20. He was arrested on suspicion of murder, but never charged,
and served four months in jail after admitting theft.

Detective Inspector Martin Hepworth, 
of West Yorkshire police, told an inquest into Mr Houghton’s death: ‘Had
there been an offence for not being a Good Samaritan, as there is in 
France, I would have charged Lowther with that, but there is not.

‘It isn’t just a matter of being public spirited, it’s a matter of public duty.’

Coroner David Hinchliff criticised Lowther for failing to get help.

‘The fact that he didn’t shows what a
thoroughly cowardly and despicable young man he is in contrast with the
two that did,’ he said.

‘What makes this all the more 
unpleasant and callous was that he was perfectly prepared to steal a 
cycle while leaving someone in the water.’

The Leeds court heard on Thursday 
that Mr Houghton was on his daily cycle ride from his home in Horsforth 
to Leeds city centre along the Kirkstall stretch of the Leeds-Liverpool 
canal when he fell off on July 29 last year.

He landed in the water, which was only 3ft deep, possibly banging his head on a boulder.

Fellow cyclist Lowther was the first 
person to find Mr Houghton, shortly after 6.30pm. He discarded his own 
bicycle, which had a puncture, in bushes and pedalled away on the dying 
man’s Apollo Vortice mountain bike.

At 6.50pm, cyclist James Atkinson and
jogger William Bentall pulled Mr Houghton from the water and gave him 
first aid until paramedics arrived.

He was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary and placed on life support, but died three days later on August 2.

A post-mortem examination revealed 
that Mr Houghton, who retired at 49 to care for his sick wife, Angela, 
died of brain damage caused by drowning.

Police traced Lowther after he gave his details to a pawnbroker’s shop, where he sold the bike  for £20.

Initially he claimed he had not seen Mr Houghton in the water, but later said he thought he was already dead.

Lowther said: ‘I picked up this bike and was just about to get on it and noticed in the canal a dead body.

‘I was shocked so I rode off. All I did was take the bike.’

He claimed that his mobile phone had run out of battery and admitted he did not try to alert the authorities.

Addressing Mr Houghton’s distraught family, who wept as the details of his final moments were revealed, Lowther said: ‘I’m really sorry for your loss. I didn’t mean it. I made a stupid mistake.’

Recording an open verdict, Mr Hinchliff said: ‘What leaves a nasty taste in everybody’s mouth is that an opportunistic thief came along, saw [Mr Houghton] in the water, believed he was dead, and choosing to do nothing, saw an opportunity to steal his cycle.’

Mr Houghton’s family were too upset to comment after the hearing.Lowther was charged with theft and jailed for four months at Leeds Magistrates’ Court in November last year. He has finished serving his sentence.
