Chris Froome was such a disappointment to Team Sky less than three years ago that manager Dave Brailsford was ready to dump him — and told a rival team he was going to be available.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that on the eve of the Vuelta a España in August 2011, Brailsford told a senior official from RadioShack that Froome was among riders whose contracts were expiring and who were not in Sky’s plans for 2012.

Sources say both teams were staying at the same hotel in Benidorm, and the pair were discussing their rider requirements.

RadioShack were interested in Sky’s Steve Cummings but Brailsford said he was already planning to go elsewhere.

‘Dave then suggested that RadioShack might be interested in Froome,’ said a source with knowledge of the meeting.

‘He made it clear things weren’t working out as envisaged and that Froome might be able to do a job elsewhere.’

RadioShack did not see Froome as the kind of rider they needed.

Touted: Froome was offered to RadioShack but they too were not keen on the British rider

Abandoned: Froome was almost dropped by Sky until a strong perfomance in 2010 changed their minds

As it transpired, Froome rode the race of his life over the next few weeks, finishing second in a breakthrough event that changed the course of his entire career.

Sky retained him and bumped up his £80,000-a-year wages. He went on to became an integral part of Bradley Wiggins’s Tour win in 2012 before winning it himself in 2013.

Froome has credited his rise in part to diagnosis and treatment of bilharzia, a tropical disease he had been unwittingly carrying until late 2010, when he embarked on a three-year battle to get rid of it.
