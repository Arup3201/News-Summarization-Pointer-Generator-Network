If you’d taken a trip to Squaw Valley in California last year, you’d have been greeted by a rather more appealing sight to skiers than if you happened to visit on the same day this year.

Ski areas in California and Colorado, as well as on the East Coast, are not getting anywhere near the amount of snow forecasters normally expect at this time of the year.

So to keep the skiers happy many resorts have made their own snow - but relatively high temperatures in the Northeast have stopped some areas from even doing that.

The Sierra Nevada mountain range in California had more than 2ft of snow last December – but many state resorts have only had inches so far this year, reported ESPN.

‘Compared to last year, it's very dry,’ Nevada meteorologist John Mittelstadt told ESPN. ‘Compared to the average, we have had Decembers like this, but it's definitely one of the dry ones.’

Low temperatures in areas such as Tahoe have helped snow-makers continue manufacturing.

‘It snows here every night because we make it snow,’ Heavenly Ski Resort spokesman Russ Pecoraro told ESPN, adding that it has ‘mid-winter conditions’ on its open trails.

Over in Colorado many resorts have had snowfall that is around three-quarters of the normal level but are still getting the income they expected.

‘Christmas is nearly sold out in town,’ Aspen-Snowmass spokesman Jeff Hanley told ESPN, saying that tourists often plan their holidays there up to a year in advance.

The U.S. Northeast posted its warmest November in a decade this year, and the mildest for some cities like Boston, Massachussetts, in more than 30 years.

The Northeast and East North Central 
regions, including Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis, had their warmest 
November since 2001, Pennsylvania-based forecaster Planalytics said.

Boston was the warmest since 1975, while Indianapolis was the warmest in over 50 years. Overall, forecasters said this November was roughly the fifth-warmest since records began in 1950.

Parts of the Northeast may have a White Christmas but most of the rest of the country will be missing a coating of snow for the holiday, forecasters said.

The first official day of winter is Thursday of this week and the East Coast is still expected to have relatively mild temperatures of around the mid-50F range for the rest of the week.
