She comes from one of Canada's wealthiest families but little is known about Sherry Brydson, who has just been named as the country's richest woman.

With an estimated wealth of $6.5 billion, the private member of the Thomson family is one of the first Canadian women billionaires to appear on an international wealth ranking.

But it is her dedication to charities helping women and the indigenous population, as well as running an award-winning restaurant and spa, that makes Ms Brydson so valuable to her home country.

On the day that Guinness Book of World Records owner James Pattison was named as Canada's richest person, Bloomberg announced that Ms Brydson had come in as the third wealthiest overall.

She is the cousin of David K R Thomson, 
heir to the Thomson media empire, and she owns a 23 per cent stake in 
the Woodbridge firm that manages the family's assets.

But she lives such a private life that even her age and details about whether she is married or has children is not known.

The Thomson family, of which Sherry Brydson is a part, made their money in newspapers.

Ms
 Brydson's grandfather, Roy - the First Baron of Fleet Street - built up
 a media empire that has at various points owned The Toronto Globe and 
Mail, the Scotsman in Edinburgh, The Sunday Times and The Times in 
London, as well as local papers in Canada.

Ms Brydson is the only child of Mr Thomson's daughter, Imra, who died in 1966.

Although
 little is known of her private life, Ms Brydson runs a successful spa 
and restaurant business and is committed to charity work.

Other businesses she is involved in include Moose Radio, Viking Air, and hotel developments in Nova Scotia.

Ms Brydson has been announced as Canada's richest woman, and third richest person.

Her cousin, David Thomson, is the second richest Canadian.

'Most people donâ€™t know she exists. People who read the 
paper know the name Thomson and know that they are rich people, but 
beyond that they have no sense of them,' Trevor Cole, a novelist who has written about the family,
 said.

The only child of Roy Thomson's daughter of Imra Brydson may shy away from the limelight, but her charitable donations are well know in her home city of Victoria and elsewhere. 

In 2006 the granddaughter of the First Baron of Fleet Street stepped in with her 
cousin David Thomson at the last minute to save a collection of sacred 
Tsimshian native artworks.

They
 paid $5.5 million for the Dundas Collection at a Sotheby's auction in 
New York, after the Royal BC Museum in Victoria was denied a grant to 
buy the pieces.

And, rather than keeping the 
important artwork for private collections, the pair funded a national 
tour so they could be widely appreciated.

'These
 treasures were intended to be passed from generation to generation. The
 way they were taken was one of the biggest mistakes that was ever made,
 and has been repaid,' she told UNPO.

The
 owner of the award-winning Bangkok Garden restaurant and Elmood Spa has
 also set up a charitable foundation in her late mother, Imra's name.

It
 has helped fund a multi-million dollar YWCA housing development, which 
provides affordable housing for women with health problems, or 
aboriginal mothers and their children who are fleeing domestic violence.

'Philanthropy has an 
important role in addressing the root causes of poverty and homelessness
 and needs to be a top priority, especially in tough economic times,' Ms
 Brydson was quoted as saying at the time.

Although
 the donation came from the family estate in memory of her mother, who 
died suddenly in 1966, it was Ms Brydson who suggested helping the 
project, according to The Star.

Ms Brydson, who lives in an ocean front property overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca in 
Victoria, has also invested in Vista Radio, and an ambulance manufacturer, and has developed hotels in Nova Scotia.

In 2003 she bought Viking Air, which makes planes for the Royal Canadian Air Force and Malaysia Airlines.

A spokesman for the billionaire declined to comment.
