One man from Texas wanted to cast his vote, but was cast out instead due to his T-shirt in support of 2nd amendment gun rights.

Chris Driskill attempted to vote on the first day of early voting in the Republican primary but was nixed because he was wearing a t-shirt that read, '2nd Amendment -- Americaâ€™s Original Homeland Security.'

The T-shirt is donned with a skull and crossbones made of shotguns. It's pro-gun and unbeknownst to him was against the Texas voting code.

Chris Driskill wore a pro-gun shirt to the voting booth and was not allowed to cast his ballot

The shirt read, '2nd Amendment, America's original Homeland Security' and donned an image with a skill with cross bones made of guns

Driskill attended his local polling place at the Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead near Houston and overheard an employee discussing his controversial tee.

'I heard a gentleman's voice over my shoulder say â€˜he can't vote with that shirt on. You'll have to either turn it inside out or you'll have to leave,' Driskill told KHOU.

Driskill initially didn't understand why the polling staff were so focused on his shirt. He thought it was because they were either 'liberal' or 'anti-gun.'

'I didn't quite understand it at first,' he said. 'I was thinking they just didn't like something about the 2nd Amendment.'

The staff didn't stop Driskill because they were liberal. They targeted him because he violated section 85.036 of the Texas Election Code pertaining to 'electioneering' for or against any candidate.

'During the time an early voting polling place is open for the conduct of early voting, a person may not electioneer for or against any candidate, measure, or political party in or within 100 feet of an outside door through which a voter may enter the building or structure in which the early voting polling place is located,' states the code.

The voting took place at the Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead

The Republican primary ballot includes a question asking yes or no in support of the 2nd amendment in places where people are allowed to bear arms.

Since Driskill's shirt advocated the 2nd amendment in gun-friendly Texas, his shirt is considered an attempt to express his political point of view.

Such electioneering is not allowed within 100 feet of the voting vicinity, as stated by the code.

In addition to his wardrobe, Driskill's Facebook page is strongly pro-gun and his 'likes' include groups like 'Freedom Munitions,' and 'Trigger Pullers.'

Even though he's a fan of guns and of expressing his support for them, when going to the ballots in the future he should maintain a neutral appearance.

Officials explained that the code is not biased and that those wearing a shirt with an image of Obama on it also would be turned away from voting.

Driskill was finally allowed to vote when he borrowed a suit jacket from a fellow Republican candidate outside the courthouse.

The gun-lover wasn't angry with the polling staff and understood their point of view.

He also said he had a message for his fellow Americans.

'If you have to turn around and go change shirts, you know, so be it,' he said. 'But get out and vote.'

Driskill's Facebook likes strongly reflect someone who is pro gun

Since his shirt was relevant to a question on the ballot it was considered 'electioneering' and he was therefore prohibited from voting
