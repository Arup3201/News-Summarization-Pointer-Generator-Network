A man accused of murdering five members of his wife's family allegedly planned to have a dead man's DNA stolen from a funeral home and planted on the murder weapon in what he referred to as his 'Plan B'.

Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, who stands accused of murdering the Lin family, had various conversations with a fellow inmate about the killings and allegedly revealed he had bought the hammer used in the attack from a 'two-dollar shop' because he knew the store's security cameras were fake.

The Crown told the court that the inmate, known as 'Witness A', had spoken of the plot, saying Xie had hoped to use a corrupt police officer - a friend of Witness A - to carry out the plan, but who was actually an undercover detective.

Mr Xie has pleaded not guilty to murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9, in their Sydney home in July 2009.

The 50-year-old is also alleged to have killed Lily's 39-year-old sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin.

Mr Xie's inmate, who gained his trust when they were in neighbouring cells in Long Bay prison, has said the accused was convinced Lily had had an affair with a man named Rob, and claimed Mr Xie said he'd seen a mobile phone and the victim's diary, both of which proved her 'willingness to leave her family', reports The Daily Telegraph

In the opening address of Mr Xie's murder trial on Monday, Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said the inmate had 21 conversations with Mr Xie over an 18-month span from July 2011.

'He had a number of conversations about the hammer in which it was implicit that he knew where it was disposed of or hidden and that it could be obtained by someone on the outside,' Mr Tedeschi told the court.

Mr Xie is also alleged to have told the inmate that he had martial arts training and 'demonstrated on Witness A a pressure point in the neck which meant he could easily incapacitate his victims.'

The court heard that the Lin family were killed by both blunt force trauma and asphyxiation in the bedrooms of their North Epping home on July 18, 2009.

The inmate reported his conversations to police and will receive a reduced prison sentence for testifying against Mr Xie.

The court was also told a smear of blood found in Mr Xie's garage had been proven to belong to Terry Lin with such certainty that there was only a 'one in 50 quadrillion chance' of it belonging to another person.

The trial continues.
