A bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night is claiming it was a drunken accident.

Christina George-Harvan, 30 and Katelyn Francis, 21, were celebrating at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, after the ceremony on April 24, 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home.

The row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car when the gun went off.

Prosecutors say George-Harvan took the weapon from the center console and deliberately shot Francis, but her defense claims it fired by accident. 

She is facing third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges.

Christina George-Harvan, 30 (pictured in court on Friday) has been accused of shooting her niece Katelyn Francis dead. She claims it was just a drunken accident 

George-Harvan and Francis, 21, (pictured) were partying after a wedding 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on April 24, 2014

George-Harvan, a former nurse, took to the stand on Thursday during her trial.  She told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece.

According to CBS Pittsburgh, she said: 'I was happy…she was so cute. We were only nine years apart. The first thing she did was say, 'Aunt Tina, I'm so happy for you,' and gave me a big hug.'

As the night went on they drank more, the court heard, and soon Mr Harvan was determined to drive home.

However Francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him.

George-Harvan said: 'When I turned around, the glove box is open and I see this gun. I think I gotta move this gun. I go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off.

The defense attorney then asked: 'Did you squeeze the trigger?'

And she replied: 'No.'

Recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece, she said: 'Everything freezes, Jeremy says, 'You just shot your [expletive] cousin'. 

George-Harvan (pictured before her first court appearance the day after the shooting) said she would never hurt her niece and insists there was no tension between the pair earlier in the evening 

The row had spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car (inside on night of shooting pictured) when the gun went off. George-Harvan claims it fired when she tried to move it 

'He steps over her dying body and he runs. I put pressure on [Katelyn's[ wound and I screamed and dialed 911.

She added, 'I felt devastated. It was like a nightmare. Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead.' 

The prosecution rested on Thursday. 

The defense called former Pennsylvania State Trooper Frederick Wentling as a ballistic experts. He told the court the weapon could discharge with just the slightest pressure on the trigger. 

According to CBS Pittsburgh, he said: 'If you put your thumb in… if you pick it up sideways, and put your thumb in there and pull it back, it will discharge. 'It's supposed to. It doesn't know what's pulling it to the rear.'

On Friday Prosecutor Brittany Smith told the jury, 'She shot somebody. She killed somebody. Do you think she used reasonable care?'

The jury is now deliberating and is considering third-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter.

The defense argues the jury should acquit her of any homicide charge under the doctrine of 'excusable homicide by misadventure,'.

The defendant has to have shown carelessness without criminal intent for that to be proven.
