A tattoo artist who has covered his body with Jaguar spots is selling his entire skin on eBay - but the buyer can only have it after he dies.

Artur Mrozowski, 41, spent 300 hours getting hundreds of big cat markings inked on by his wife, Monika, at their tattoo parlour in Blackpool, Lancashire.

They cover a staggering 90 per cent of his skin - including his torso, back, arms and legs.

Not looking good so far: Now, he has put the finished Jaguar print up for sale on the auction site for £75,000

Now, he has put the finished Jaguar print up for sale on the auction site for £75,000 - but it is not available until after he dies.

Mr Mrozowski, who was born in Warsaw, Poland, said he hoped the funds raised by his skin would give his children a 'good start in life'.

'People say I am crazy, but we all die anyway and some people donate their organs, some people do nothing with their bodies. I have nothing to lose,' said the father-of-four.

'Yes, £75,000 is a lot of money but it is nothing to someone who is really wealthy. I would be quite happy with that, but no less, because it took a lot of time and pain to get these tattoos.

'In my heart, I'm hoping for an even higher amount, but I didn't ask for more because I didn't want it to look like a joke.'

He added: 'The main reason for doing this is my kids. It
 would give them a good start in adult life and let them decide what 
they want to do in life, not just what they have to do to make a living.

'My family is the most important thing to me and I want to strive to do as good as possible for them.'

Mr Mrozowski, who co-runs Jaguar Skin Tattoo Parlour with his wife, said he believed the sale of his skin was a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' for prospective buyers.

'It is a bargain really. It is the price of a new car, like a Jaguar,' he said. 'There are plenty of Rolls Royces or Jaguars out there but having a wallet made out of human Jaguar skin is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.'

'We will make an agreement that my skin will be delivered when I pass away.

Advert: The tattoo artist's eBay listing 
advertises his skin as the 'the smoothest, softest leather on Earth'

"The
 tattoos cost a lot - not in terms of money, but because of the pain and 
because at first my wife did not want to do the tattoos.

'She thought it 
was a sin to change the natural body and it took time to persuade her - 
and now she is one of the best tattoo artists in Europe.'

Mr Mrozowsi's eBay listing, which expires on Sunday, advertises his skin as the 'the smoothest, softest leather on Earth'.

Confident: Mr Mrozowsi claims the few people he has told of his unique plan are supportive

It reads: 'Would you like REALLY impress your friends?

'The most exclusive wallets, belts, lamps - or anything, it's about your imagination. Humans skin crafting has a rich traditions; genuine reason to sell.

'I'm still alive so you get your material after my death and it's great investment. Product out of this natural material reach the highest prices on a market, so you get whatever you ask for if for re-sell.

'Human leather is the finest grain leather that is obtainable. Is the smoothest, softest leather on Earth.

'On top of that that the skin is already tattooed artistically in a unique design: jaguar skin. The tattoo covers 90 per cent.

'It takes 300+ hours to complete that such a work. The size is approximately 2 square meters, in great condition (I'm vegetarian).

'Delivery arranged through correspondence. Any question do not hesitate to ask (a snake is NOT included).'

Despite the unique nature of the product, the listing has attracted only one bid so far - a measly 99 pence.

But Mr Mrozowsi claims the few people he has told of his plan are supportive - with his friend, Donna McGowan, saying: 'lt really is a bit of a genius idea. He has definitely tapped into a bit of a niche market.'

However, not everyone is convinced by his unusual idea.

Dr Kadaba Vasudev, a retired consultant pathologist who used to work at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, said: 'I have never come across anything like that in all my years of working in medicine.

'Once the patient is dead the skin dies as well so, medically speaking, I don't think it would be any use. I have never heard of that happening.'

One website that appears to be UK-based - but is in fact registered in India - sells human leathergoods which it claims are 'legal'.

It says it caters to a 'highly discerning clientele' and its prices start at £7,500 for a wallet - with a pair of shoes costing a whopping £15,000.

But legal or not, Mr Mrozowsi's listing goes against eBay's rules, which state 'humans, the human body, or any human body parts' cannot be sold on the site.

An eBay spokesman said: 'The sale of any human body item on eBay is not allowed and this listing will be removed.'

Artur Mrozowsi is not the only person to be using his body as a living canvas.

Britain's most tattooed man - who has changed his name to The King of Inkland -  revealed today he has spent £6,000 getting some of his tattoos removed because he has run out of space on his skin and wants to 'start again'.

Matthew Whelan, from Birmingham, has covered his whole body with ink, including an eyeball, but now believes he looks out of date.

The 34-year-old has set aside £6,000 for
 the painful process of laser removal because he sees himself as a 
'living canvas' and human 'art gallery' that needs to evolve.

'I think of myself like an art gallery. After a while the art gets old and people want to see something new and that's how I feel about my tattoos,' he said.

'I've had enough of them and I've run out of skin to tattoo on - so I thought why not get them lasered off and just start again.'

Covered: Meanwhile, one U.S. man has tattooed his entire body with leopard spots, including his private parts

Meanwhile, in America, one man has gone one step further than Mr Mrozowsi and has tattooed his entire body with leopard spots - including his back, ears and private parts.

The tattoo fanatic, named 'Larry Da Leopard' has more than 1,000 big cat markings on his body after spending years getting inked.

However, he says he is still not finished and that he will not stop until he has become a so-called 'manimal' - half man, half animal.
