Troubled: A new biography has revealed that poet Sylvia Plath tried to cut her throat at the age of 10

Poet Sylvia Plath tried to cut her throat at the age of 10 - two decades before the troubled writer killed herself, a new biography has claimed.

The revelation about the American novelist's troubled childhood has emerged on the eve of the 50th anniversary of her death.

Plath, who committed suicide when she was 30, had also cut her face four years later, having battled depression following the death of her father Otto when she was eight-years-old.

The details of Plath's early years are revealed in a new biography, Mad Girl's Love Song, by author Andrew Wilson.

He had access to previously unseen letters her mother Aurelia wrote to the poet's two children Frieda and Nicholas, who hardly knew Plath.

Mr Wilson also saw an unpublished memoir by one of Plath's former boyfriends, Gordon Lameyer, and interviewed a number of her friends, who had remain silent until now.

They included Philip McCurdy, who told Mr Wilson about his childhood friend's attempt at cutting her own throat.

Mr Wilson told The Sunday Times: 'I think it is now what we now call self harming. But clearly something was very wrong.'

The letters from Aurelia, who died in 1994, were uncovered when Mr Wilson found her neighbour Dorinda Cruickshank's home in Boston.

Ms Cruickshank had died in 2007 but she had passed the collection onto her daughter.

Many people had blamed Plath's suicide at her home in north London on her husband and fellow poet Ted Hughes.

But Mr Wilson explained how the death of Otto had severely effected her many years earlier.

He said: 'I suppose you could say she had an Electra complex. She adored him, but then hated him when he left her by dying.'

In her poem Daddy, she referred to her 
suicide attempt in 1953. She wrote: 'At twenty I tried to die / And get 
back, back, back to you.'

Plath, who was resentful of her poor background, also thought of her mother, with whom she shared a bedroom, as controlling.

She went onto have numerous lovers, which Mr Wilson said was an attempt to find a substitute for her father.

Mr Wilson tracked down her former boyfriend, Richard Sassoon, a relative of the poet Siegfried, who gave permission for his letters to be published.

It allowed the biographer to piece together how his rejection of Plath led her to Hughes.

He also found references in other writings to how Plath left psychiatric hospital following her suicide attempt with an 'unresolved illness'.

Mr Wilson said: 'She was an angry young woman - the American version of the angry young man of John Osborne's Jimmy Porter.'
