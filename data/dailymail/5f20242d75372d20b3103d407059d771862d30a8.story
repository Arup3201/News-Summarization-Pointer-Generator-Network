Apology: Tech entrepreneur Greg Gopman posted a rant hitting out at San Francisco's homeless community on his Facebook page

The chief executive of a technology start up company has apologized after describing homeless people in an area of San Francisco as 'trash'.

In an astonishing Facebook post, Greg Gopman, CEO of start up 'hackathon' organizer AngelHack, ranted that underprivileged residents of the city should 'keep to themselves' on the outskirts of the city and 'beg coyly'.

In a lengthy diatribe prompted by a walk through the Market Street area of the city, Mr Gopman wrote: 'I’ve traveled around the world and I gotta say there is nothing more grotesque than walking down market st in San Francisco.

'Why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash I have no clue.

'Each time I pass it my love affair with SF dies a little.'

But Gopman, who reportedly moved to the city from suburban Florida, wasn't finished.

In a separate callous post, the entrepreneur went on to suggest moving the underprivileged and institutions put in place to try and help them to nearby Daly City.

He added: 'The difference is in other cosmopolitan cities, the lower part of society keep to themselves.

'They sell small trinkets, beg coyly, stay quiet, and generally stay out of your way.

'They realize it’s a privilege to be in the civilized part of town and view themselves as guests. And that’s okay.

He added: 'In downtown SF the degenerates gather like hyenas, spit, urinate, taunt you, sell drugs, get rowdy, they act like they own the center of the city. 

'Like it’s their place of leisure… In actuality it’s the business district for one of the wealthiest cities in the USA. It a disgrace. I don’t even feel safe walking down the sidewalk without planning out my walking path.

'You can preach compassion, equality, and be the biggest lover in the world, but there is an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class.

Large audience: Gopman's Facebook posted his thoughts to his near 3,300 followers

'There is nothing positive gained from having them so close to us. It’s a burden and a liability having them so close to us.

'Believe me, if they added the smallest iota of value I’d consider thinking different, but the crazy toothless lady who kicks everyone that gets too close to her cardboard box hasn’t made anyone’s life better in a while.'

Although Gopman later removed the post so that it could no longer be seen by his near 3,300 Facebook friends, screen grabs of his views soon appeared elsewhere on the internet.

His company's Twitter feed was bombarded with messages from people keen to share their view and tell Gopman exactly what they think of his controversial views.

Unfortunately for AngelHack, the firm's Twitter feed was reportedly set up to automatically retweet messages every time the company got a mention.

AngelHack's Twitter feed since appears to have been taken down from the site.

Mr Gopman issued an apology for his 'inappropriate' comments via his Facebook page last night.

He said: 'I'm really sorry for my comments. I trivialized the plight of those struggling to get by and I shouldn't have.

'I hope this thread can help start an open discussion on what changes we can make to fix these serious problems.'

But it seems that some of his Facebook friends might have approved of his original comments.

One posted: 'It isn't like you said anything many others in the startup community aren't saying.'

Another said: 'No way!!! Do not sorry to anyone (sic).'

Gorman founded AngelHack in 2011 and the company now hosts 'hackathons' - events where thousands of tech experts get together and share their expertise - in major cities across the world, including London, Sydney, Seoul and Washington DC.

He describes himself on his Twitter feed as a start up adviser, marketer, world traveler and 'friend to many'.

Almost 6,500 people are thought to be homeless in San Francisco according to official figures, with around 30 per cent of those from the LGBT community.
