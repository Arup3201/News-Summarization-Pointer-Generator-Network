The black police detective who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan has finally told his story in his own words - and has revealed that he played former Grand Wizard David Duke for a fool - convincing even him that he was  white racist.

Detective Ron Stallworth rose up the ranks of the Colorado Springs, Colorado, chapter of the KKK in the 1970s - even becoming its leader - just by responding to a want ad in the local newspaper.

Mr Stallworth was able to do all this over the telephone. In the rare times he was required to make an appearance at meetings, he sent a white detective in his place.

Now, Mr Stallworth is released a book with his story, Black Klansman, where he reveals just how high the clan had risen in Colorado in the 1920s and 30s and how low it had fallen by the time he began investigating in the 1970s.

Telling his story: Retired DRon Stallworth made a mockery of the Ku Klux Klan by infiltrating it in the 1970s. He operated entirely over the telephone

David Duke, the Grand Wizard of the Knights of the KKK, spoke several times on the phone to Mr Stallworth - and the detective played him for a fool

Perhaps his greatest coup was winning over Duke, the charismatic leader of the KKK, who had a national profile after running for public office - including U.S. President.

Mr Stallworth claims that he fooled even Duke into thinking he was a white man.

'I can always tell when I’m talking to a n*****. Take you for example. I can tell that you’re a pure Aryan white man by the way you talk, the way you pronounce certain words and letters,' Duke boasted, according to the Daily Beast.

'N******s do not have the same intelligence as the white man to properly speak English the way it was meant to be spoken,' he added.

Mr Stallworth says he the Klan leader never suspected he was a black man.

And he played Duke like a fiddle. He says the Louisiana native was easily flattered and so eager to impress that he shared his plans for rallies and action all over the country. Mr Stallworth passed these along to the FBI and his colleagues at police departments around the country.

When Duke visited Colorado Springs, the police chief assigned Mr Stallworth - acting as an office - to guard him.

Mr Stallworth used the opportunity to get a picture of himself with his arms around the Klan leader, according to the Daily Beast.

Mr Stallworth writes that the Klan used to rule Colorado politics in the 1920s and 30s. Klansman Ben Stapleton was mayor for many years and that the Denver International Airport was named after him until 1995. Governor Clarence Morely was a Klansman and both U.S. Senators had dealings with the Klan.

By the 1970s, though, the ranks had thinned and membership had become pathetic.

When Duke came to Colorado Springs, for instance, the leader had trouble finding 100 Klansmen with a fully set of the white robes to march alongside him.
