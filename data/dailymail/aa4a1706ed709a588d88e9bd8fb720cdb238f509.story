Prayers were said yesterday to remember tragic Joanna Yeates, a year after she was murdered by her neighbour Vincent Tabak.

Visitors to her local church in Bristol also lit candles in her memory and left messages of condolence in a card for her family.

The 25-year-old landscape architect was 
last seen alive on the night of December 17, 2010, in the Clifton area 
of the city. Eight days later her body was found on a snowy verge three 
miles away.

Poignant note: A moving tribute from a juror at the trial of her killer was attached to a fresh bunch of flowers left at the verge where her body was found

Rev Paul Langham, from Christ Church,
Clifton, said: ‘Anybody in the community or anybody else who’d like to 
come in and be quiet are welcome to perhaps light a candle in Jo’s 
memory.

‘We have a card for her parents if 
people would like to sign that. It’s a small way of marking this 
dreadful day in our community’s history.’

A couple's message said: 'We wanted to express our deepest sympathies to you all at this very sad time of year for you. We lost our own son in an accident ten
years ago. This does not equate with the awful experience you have had 
but we understand a little of what you have been going through.

'The sense of loss never goes but we 
hope that the pain will slowly ease for you as time passes. Our thoughts
and prayers are with you.'

Another moving tribute read: 'Your beautiful 
daughter may be gone but Jo is not forgotten in the Clifton community 
and our thoughts and prayers are with you at this sad time.

'May you know
God's peace, love and comfort always.'

One couple at the church wrote:  ‘We 
wanted to express our deepest sympathies to you all at this very sad 
time of year for you. The sense of loss never goes but we hope that the 
pain will ease for you as time passes.’

Miss Yeates’s body was found by dog walkers on Christmas morning  in Failand, North Somerset. She had been strangled.

Yesterday, a bunch of flowers was 
left at the scene. A message with the flowers was signed ‘A juror’, 
prompting speculation that it was from one of the 12 jurors who had 
tried Tabak.

It read: ‘Joanna, one year ago I 
didn’t know you. Sadly one year on and I shall never know the person I 
came to wish I had known.’

Tabak, 33, a Dutch
engineer, was convicted of the 25-year-old's murder in October and 
jailed for life. He will serve a minimum 20 years' imprisonment.

During his trial at Bristol Crown 
Court, the jury heard he strangled Miss Yeates in a violent 
confrontation at the flat she shared with boyfriend Greg Reardon in 
Canynge Road, Clifton.

He then spun a web of lies and deceit 
to cover his tracks - taking her body back to his flat, then going night
shopping in Asda with the body in his car boot.

Within an hour he had dumped her 
partially clothed corpse on the verge, and just 24 hours later was 
drinking champagne with friends.

The court heard that Tabak was obsessed with images of women being strangled during sex.

Earlier this week, Mr Reardon spoke of his pain at losing the love of his life and said they would probably have married one day.

He said:'The thought of proposing had crossed my mind although it was probably some time off.

'It was more about taking things one step at a time and seeing where life took us than having a 'five-year plan' or whatever.

'I've visited her grave and will continue to do so. We are in the process of organising a proper headstone and it will be nice to see that in place.

'I'm not sure specifically what I'll do to remember Jo in the future but I'm certainly not going to forget her.'

Miss Yeates's father, David, 63, said he and his family continued to struggle with their loss.

'Our lives go on and we still have to deal with the fact that Jo is no longer around,' he told BBC South.

'She
loved Christmas - that was her best time of the year. She loved playing
games, cards and being competitive. She enjoyed the whole razzmatazz to
do with Christmas.

'That's why being found on Christmas Day was so poignant.'

Mr
Reardon told The Sun he met Miss Yeates in 2008 after they both 
started working for the BDP architecture firm in Bristol, and described 
her as modest, conscientious and laid-back.

He
said the couple had lived together for over a year and had a pet cat, 
adding: 'My mum and dad were very proud of me for finding such a nice 
girl.'

Mr Reardon was visiting his brother in Sheffield when Tabak murdered her in their home.

The 28-year-old was praised, along with Miss Yeates's family, by police for his dignity during Tabak's trial.

He told The Sun: 'The trial was a bloody nightmare, but we all had to grit our teeth and ride it through. It was surreal facing Tabak in court. I just had to keep calm and get through it.

'After the trial was over I felt a big release of tension but it just left me a little numb and empty. I was glad of the result, though.'
