Former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell will head the 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing'

The Government has announced the creation of an organisation that will assess how policy impacts the nation's happiness.

The 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing' is the latest addition to the 'What Works Network', which was launched by the Government last year to improve public services through 'evidence-based policy and practice'.

The new centre will soon be commissioning universities to research the impact that different services have on the British public's wellbeing.

Professor Kevin Fenton, Executive Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England, called the centre, the 'first of its kind in the world'.

He added: 'The shift to wellbeing is a key aspect of public health and there are clear benefits to this approach.

'We are keen to see the evidence of what works for wellbeing much more effectively disseminated and adopted across the country.

'We are confident that this work will lead to better outcomes for health in communities, workplaces and more widely.

'PHE recently launched its key priorities for improving and protecting the public's health. 

'Making a shift towards wellbeing and focusing on what helps keep people and communities well is one of the key drivers and opportunities we see going forward.'

The 'What Works Centre for Wellbeing' has initial funding of more than £3.5 million over three years, with the support of Government departments, arts foundations and charities.

Last year Lord O'Donnell said that putting people's health and wellbeing at the heart of policy making was 'the next stage of public sector reform', adding: 'This is about better Government, not bigger Government.'
