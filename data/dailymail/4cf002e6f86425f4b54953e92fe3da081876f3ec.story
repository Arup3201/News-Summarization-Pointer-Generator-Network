Brazil are in danger of ruining the narrative of their own World Cup. This has been a joyful three-and-a-half weeks in South America and Brazil’s place in their own final would not do a romantic plot-line any harm.

Nevertheless, the host nation’s reaction to the loss of their best player last Friday has begun to  take a little of the shine from their presence in the last four.

We can understand Brazilian  sadness at the injury to Neymar. The impish forward is the star player in a flawed team and, for a while, looked the best chance Brazil had of lifting the trophy in Rio on Sunday.

Down and out: Neymar was ruled out for the tournament after suffering a back injury

Grounded: The Brazilian was hit in the back by Colombia's Juan Camilo Zuniga during the quarter-finals

That he is gone, though, is a cause for regret but not recrimination.

Brazil’s reaction to his injury — caused in the challenge with Colombia’s Juan Camilo Zuniga — has not reflected well on them. It was a poor tackle, certainly. Zuniga will not take any great pride in it.

It was, however, Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team that set the tone on that brutish night in Brasilia. It was the players in yellow who sought to reduce the contest to a test of physicality as much as football, their coach who clearly did not fancy taking on Colombia purely at what Brazil themselves once classified the Beautiful Game.

The bottom line is that if you go out looking for fights, there is always a chance you may not win and, even if you do, you are always likely to sustain collateral damage.

Zuniga was not the villain that night. Scolari was the coach who devised the tactics, Fernandinho his henchman and Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo the man without the common sense or courage to do anything about it.

Brazil, though, have thrashed about wildly since they realised the extent of the fall-out.

Somehow they persuaded FIFA to look retrospectively at Zuniga’s challenge on Neymar, unsurprisingly the disciplinary committee yesterday decided to take no action against the Colombian.

Their appeal against the booking that  rules Thiago Silva out of today’s semi-final against Germany was also unsuccessful.

Tearful: Neymar sent an emotional message to the Brazilian public after his injury

All this against a background of sentimentality and noise about their fallen child.

Scolari told us that, after the injury, Neymar could not feel his legs. Then on Sunday the Brazil team doctor revealed that impact 2.5cm further along Neymar’s spine could have left the Barcelona player with permanent damage.

We should all be glad the 22-year-old escaped that, of course, but this is a rather transparent brand of propaganda from Brazil and, in all honesty, it is better left untouched. Neymar, after all, is due to be playing again by the time the La Liga season starts in Spain.

Whether Scolari and his cohorts are trying to place undue pressure on today’s referee Marco Rodriguez or make Joachim Low’s Germans think twice about making their tackles we can only speculate. If that is the plan, we can only imagine that Sebastien Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels are not worrying too much about it.

If Brazil are to reach the final and pay back their public on a tournament that has cost millions then they will not bully their way to Rio.

That was a one-trick hand and it has been played.
