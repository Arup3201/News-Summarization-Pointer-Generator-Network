Whether it's snails and spiders or kangaroo meat, we have all tried foreign cuisine before - and not necessarily enjoyed it.

Now a new video has captured the reactions of South Korean women as they eat some of the US's most popular junk food snacks for the first time.

The guinea pigs are offered Goldfish crackers, salt and vinegar crisps, Poptarts, Cheez-its, Twizzlers, Rice Cripsy bars and War Heads Sour candy.

Two South Korean women attempt to eat Poptarts, which leaves them completely flummoxe

The clip, posted on YouTube by Sw Yoon, sees the women's curious and horrified reactions to the contents of the food - including the amount of artificial flavours they contain. 

They are first presented with Goldfish cracker, with which they seem completely flummoxed.

'What is this?' asks one of the testers as the snack is presented to her.

'Gold fish marshmallow?' asks another.

Many of the girls are reluctant to eat it, with one saying it looks like dog food and another adding that it is a baby snack or something an 'elementary teacher would give kids when they're good'. 

One of the women in the video looks amused as she breaks a piece off a Poptart 

The salt and vinegar crisps were the least popular snacks because of their strong flavour

Despite their initial complaining, the women score the Goldfish crackers between three and nine stars, with one woman describing the taste as like their eating 'belly fat'.

The strawberry-flavoured Poptarts cause even more confusion, with the majority of the women taking a long time to examine the jam-filled snack.

One bewildered young woman repeatedly turns it over in her hand and says: 'It looks extremely obscure' while another tester takes a sniff of the pink-coloured breakfast item before quipping 'Ah the smell of artificiality.' 

One woman says the snack tastes 'like a toy' and another 'like a candle'. 

Although some of the participants eventually came round to some of the western flavours 

The majority of the girls found Twizzlers very unpleasant and compared the texture to rubber 

The chocolate Rice Crispies snack bars are a welcome relief from the two previous snacks.

'Finally something that's edible,' says one of the particularly unimpressed testers.  

'Is there anyone who would hate this? It's pretty much a combination that's impossible to taste bad,' says another.

The girls favourite snack was the chocolate Rice Cripies bars 

Some of the girls came up with bizarre comparisons for the stateside snacks 

The women are particularly suspicious of the salt and vinegar crisps. 

'Wait. My nose isn't weird right?' says one of the women giving the potato chips a sniff before taking a bite: 'What why, what did they make this for? To eat it and spit it out?'

'What does it taste like?' the researcher asks her. 'Like as if someone's punching my tongue.' 

The extreme sour War Heads were easily the most unpopular of the snacks 

Unsurprisingly she only awards the offensive snack one star out of ten before claiming that it is a waste of potatoes.  

To follow the salty snack the crew give their willing subjects a cherry Twizzler eat to try but even before they try the candy they are presented with problems. 

'How do you cut this?' asks one adding 'For real do you cut it with your mouth?'

But the women are equally unimpressed with the taste as well.

'Did I do something wrong to you?' asks one of the samplers after taking a bite from the candy. 

The extremely sour candy left the girls bewildered as to who would actually want to eat them 

The rest of the women agree that the fruity smell is misleading and the snack is comparable to chewing on rubber with one adding: 'If I had a napkin I think I'd spit it out.' 

Next, the women taste the savoury Cheez-its - which they say would work well with alcohol.

'If they gave this as a side dish at bars and pubs I think people would keep eating it non stop,' one says.

One woman opts to spit out the sweets as she finds them too sour to chew 

'Yeah I think it would be great with wine,' her friend agrees. 

To finish their tasting session the producers of the video are particularly cruel dishing out each participant with the infamously sour candy War Heads.  

The women are wary from the start. One cautiously sniffs it and asks, 'This isn't going to explode or anything right?'

'Do I just eat? I have a weird hunch about this. You're trying to kill us aren't you?' asks another.

What follows is a series of pained expressions as each of the women's faces shrink in detest of the intense flavour.

'It's so sour,' one of them manages between splutters before threatening the crew 'I'm gonna kick your ass. What are you trying to do? I'll see you after this.'

For several of the samplers the flavour is too much and they have to resort to spitting the small sweet out and one woman takes several gulps of water to recover.

Unsurprisingly scores start at zero and raise to a four apart from one adventurous tester who gives it a seven before changing her answer to a seven point five.
