Nigel Farage yesterday stoked the row over his ‘racist’ attack on Romanians by insisting that they were more likely to commit crime than other immigrants.

The UKIP leader said it was ‘perfectly legitimate’ to point out ‘where there are differential crime rates between nationalities’.

The defiance came 24 hours after an interview in which Mr Farage, whose wife is German, claimed people would rather live next door to Germans than Romanians.

Nigel Farage said people 'have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door'

When asked
 what the difference was, in an interview considered so disastrous that 
his senior media aide, Patrick O’Flynn, interrupted to try to stop it, 
Mr Farage said: ‘You know what the difference is.’

Yesterday,
 rather than apologise, the UKIP leader declared: ‘Where there are 
differential crime rates between nationalities, it is perfectly 
legitimate to point this out and to discuss it in the public sphere.’

He added: ‘Police figures are quite clear that there is a high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain.

‘This is not to say for a moment that all or even most Romanian people living in the UK are criminals.

‘But
 it is to say that any normal and fair-minded person would have a 
perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly 
moved in next door.’

LBC presenter James O'Brien said Farage was 'one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in living memory'

Mr
 Farage emphatically denied UKIP was racist and said his comments about 
Romanians moving in were being criticised by media commentators who 
lived in ‘million-pound houses and for whom the prospect of such a turn 
of events is not a real one’.

Meanwhile,
 the LBC presenter who conducted the original interview has branded Mr 
Farage ‘one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in 
living memory’.

In
 an article for The Mail on Sunday, James O’Brien writes today about the
 radio interview with Farage, saying that the UKIP leader’s ‘cultivated 
“pint and a fag” facade’ had slipped.

Mr
 O’Brien says: ‘When the man who leads the party lets his mask slip 
briefly, it is hardly surprising that people are beginning to ask 
questions about his convictions.’

The radio presenter described Mr Farage as a ‘political Pied Piper’ leading blindly dancing followers.

To
 make matters worse for Mr Farage, the multi-millionaire funding his 
party issued a veiled warning that he could walk away unless UKIP won 
this week’s European elections.

Nigel Farage insisted that UKIP was not a racist political party

Paul
 Sykes, who is financing UKIP’s £1.5 million poster campaign, revealed 
that he has made no commitments to the party beyond this Thursday.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have told them – I am doing nothing until I see the European results.

‘When
 I know the vast majority of people are voting UKIP, have voted to leave
 the EU, then I’m going to roll my sleeves up. But we need that first.’

The
 frank remarks will send a shiver down the spine of Mr Farage, who will 
recall how Mr Sykes spectacularly abandoned the party shortly after the 
European election campaign of 2004.

The
 former member of the Con­servative Party, who is worth an estimated 
£650 million, dumped UKIP after it announced it was out to ‘kill’ the 
Tories.

However,
 Mr Sykes also stressed yesterday that the UKIP of 2014 was a far more 
impressive operation and made clear he is now a ‘lot more’ committed to 
the party.

Despite
 all of Mr Farage’s problems, a ComRes opinion poll last night forecast 
that UKIP was still on course to win the European elections. It put UKIP
 on 35 points – with Labour on 24 and the Tories on just 20. The Lib 
Dems were languishing in fifth place on six points – one behind the 
Greens.
