Police are hoping to cut out shoplifting in a crime-plagued town - by deploying cardboard officers.

The flatpack PCs will be propped up in shop windows in St. Austell, Cornwall in the hope that passing crooks will mistake them for real people.

Each cut-out will be holding a white board with a tally of how many shoplifters have been caught in the town.

Police are installing a cardboard officer in a Co-op store in St. Austell, Cornwall, to deter shoplifters. The cutout will be holding a white sign with the number of thieves caught in the area displayed on it

But locals are unconvinced the two-dimensional recruits will deter seasoned thieves who repeatedly target the town's shops.

Cardboard police officers, costing about £25 each, have been used by a number of forces but opponents have branded them a gimmick.

Some forces claim they have slashed crimes like shoplifting by 50 per cent but in other areas thieves have simply nicked the cut-outs.

The deployment, beginning in a Co-op, is part of a drive against anti-social behaviour in the run-up to Christmas.

Inspector Tony Joslin said: 'Shoplifting has an impact on all of us. Big retailers factor in the amount they are likely to lose through shoplifting in prices, so every theft adds to your food bill.

Officers said the cutouts are designed to cut down on anti-social behaviour in the lead up to Christmas

'When you are talking about major supermarket chains you are talking about an enormous amount of money.

'There is also the fact that shoplifting covers up a lot of other issues such as social deprivation and alcohol and drug use.'

Locals weren't convinced the cardboard coppers would make much difference.

Steve Williamson, manager of a nearby food bank, said: 'People who get desperate enough to steal in the first place won't be deterred by a cardboard man if they are not deterred by the security guard.'

But Jake Moore, 27, who runs a Spar store which was robbed by a masked robber earlier this year, said: 'I guess I would consider installing one. Any kind of deterrent is better than nothing.'
