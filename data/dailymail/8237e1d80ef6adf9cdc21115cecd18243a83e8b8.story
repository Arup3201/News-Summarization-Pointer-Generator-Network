Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro's top lawyer in Britain, claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to discrimination

A top lawyer at a leading global bank who claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to stress after being subjected to bullying and intimidating remarks has lost her discrimination claims.

Angela Cobbina, 41, said she was hounded out of her job at ABN Amro - where she was the Dutch banking giant’s top lawyer - after UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve made repeated racist comments that led to her being 'systematically frozen out'.

And she claimed the stress of her ordeal may have contributed to her suffering a miscarriage early last year.

Ms Cobbina was suing the bank for a reported £300,000 for sex, race and religious discrimination over claims she was a victim of a 'campaign' of harassment.

Today the Central London Employment Tribunals ruled against her on the claims of discrimination but in her favour on a separate claim of unfair dismissal.

In her claim Ms Cobbina, from Streatham in south London, alleged Mr Schuilwerve began his racist abuse the first time he met her on 17 September 2012.

In the following 12 months she was then the 'target of a campaign designed to remove or drive me from the business.

'I was variously excluded, overlooked, targeted for undue criticism, including in connection with my performance, conduct, appearance and personal belief, and otherwise treated differently from my colleagues.'

In the midst of the alleged racist campaign against her, Ms Cobbina discovered she was pregnant during the Christmas break 2012 and was 'ecstatic' at the prospect of becoming a mother for the first time.

She added she was determined to put the bad blood between her and her boss behind her but at a meeting with Mr Schuilwerve on 30 January she claims she was 'bullied' and 'intimidated' and she left the office feeling 'very down and worried about my work'.

She added: 'That night I experienced severe stomach pain and miscarried my baby. I will never know for certain whether these two events are related. But I connected them in my mind at the time and still do.'

But Mr Schuilwerve strongly denied allegations of racism and in his witness statement said he has a 'zero tolerance attitude to discrimination and harassment issues' and found the allegations 'deeply hurtful'.

Mr Schuilwerve was quizzed about his attitude to race after it emerged he 'liked' a petition to keep the Dutch 'Black Pete' Christmas parades on Facebook.

This traditional event involves people ‘blacking up’ and wearing bright red lipstick to start the Christmas season.

He explained that the parade was a Dutch tradition and he supported it because he has three young children and that 91 per cent of the Dutch population also supported it despite the UN branding it racist.

Ms Cobbina was told in February 2013 the bank was considering axing her position as part of restructuring, and in September 2013 informed her she was being made redundant.

An ABN AMRO spokesperson said: 'We are pleased the judgement supports our strong belief that the various allegations of discrimination on grounds of sex, race and religion were entirely groundless.

'ABN AMRO is committed to diversity across its global operations and at every level of the organisation.'

The panel delivered a summary judgement and will provide the parties with its detailed decision at a later date. A remedy hearing will take place after Ms Cobbina’s and the bank’s lawyers have read the reasons.
