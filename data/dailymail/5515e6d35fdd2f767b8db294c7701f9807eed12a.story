The cyclist whose collision with a CBS executive's wife ultimately led to her death is believed to have top ratings on a fitness app which allows users to race each other.

Jason Marshall, 31, who hit 59-year-old Jill Tarlov while she was walking through Central Park last Thursday, is said to be an avid user of Strava, a service which allows riders to challenge one another and share their locations via GPS.

It has a ranking system where cyclists can record their times over 2.5million different routes in a bid to become KOM - or King Of The Mountain - or complete various 'achievements'.

Jason Marshal, 31, is alleged to have been an avid user of Strava, the mobile phone app that allows cyclists to race against each other by recording times over certain distances

Victim: Jill Tarlov, pictured, suffered severe head injuries during the crash last Friday and died in hospital on Monday. Marshall has said the collision was an 'unavoidable accident' 

A screenshot of the Strava profile reportedly belonging to Jason Marshall shows that he completed four 'achievements' on the app the day of the fatal collision 

The app uses GPS so cyclists can keep track of their speed and record times over certain stretches of road

According to New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer, Marshall had completed four  'achievements' - where he beat his own personal best - in New York city on the day he collided with Mrs Tarlov last week. She died in hospital on Monday.

They included being the second-fastest over three stretches of road, and third fastest over another.

He is also alleged to have hit speeds of 28.9mph on West Drive earlier that day - the area where the crash took place which has a speed limit of 25mph.

Robert Wright, a Financial Times reporter who blogs about cycling at Invisible Man, said of the crash: 'To judge by accounts of Jason Marshall's keen pursuit of records on Strava … his overall, incautious determination to maintain his speed may have been far more culpable than anything specific about his reaction on encountering people crossing the road.' 

There have been two lawsuits associated with the app in the San Francisco Bay Area - where it was created. 

In 2010, William Flint reportedly flipped his bike while trying to take the top spot in the app.

His family tried to sue the makers of Strava, claiming they had created a 'wild, wild West culture where [law-breaking] is encouraged and rewarded' - but the suit was overturned. 

In 2013, another rider was convicted of manslaughter for riding through a red light and mowing down a 71-year-old pedestrian because he 'was  way too committed to stop.'

He'd been using the app during the ride, and there was speculation he was trying to set a personal record at the time. This case however was also not proven.

A spokesman from Strava told Mail Online: 'Last week’s accident in Central Park is a tragedy and we offer our sincere condolences to all involved. 

'We believe everyone is responsible for their own safety and the safety of those around them while riding and running. 

We encourage good behavior within our community through the guideposts described at Strava, and ask our members to use good judgement and understand the responsibility that they have to act within the limits of the law.'

Hours after Mrs Tarlov's death, jazz-saxophonist Marshall said in a statement that he was 'utterly devastated' about the crash, calling the incident 'an unavoidable accident.' 

He then added: 'I am deeply, deeply saddened about the accidental collision that I had with Ms. Jill Tarlov last week and her subsequent passing.'

Legal rep: Thought not charged with any crime yet, Marshall (above) released his statement today through his lawyer

Some cyclists who have ridden alongside Marshall s told the Daily Intelligencer he is 'energetic' and 'enthusiastic' but is a relative newcomer.

One, without revealing their name, added that at that time of day he should have been riding on a more deserted stretch of road.  

Miss Tarlov of Fairfield Connecticut, was in New York City on Thursday to buy her daughter a gift, when she was hit by  Marshall while walking through Central Park.

The mother of two was rushed to New York Presbyterian hospital where she was put on life support.

On Monday, her husband, CBS executive Mike Wittman, released a statement confirming that she had passed away. 

'My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable,' Mr Wittman wrote.

'Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion, and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by. Everyone who had ever met her was somehow made better by her company.

'Even though she has been taken from us far too soon, her spirit will live on forever. On behalf of our family, I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and request privacy during the difficult times ahead,' Mr Wittman said.

It's unclear whether her family took her off life support.

Tarlov also used to work at CBS, and the company issued a statement following her death, saying they would work to help prevent similar tragedies in the future.

'We are heartsick over the passing of our dear friend and former 1010 WINS Radio colleague Jill Tarlov,' Anton Guitano, chief operating officer of CBS Local Media and Peter Dunn, presiden tof CBS television, said in a joint statement.

'As we mourn the loss of our friend and console Mike and his family, we are committed to doing what we can to bring greater public awareness of the perils of unsafe and distracted driving by motorists and cyclists that endangers pedestrians. Far too many people have been killed or seriously injured on our streets,' the statement read.

Cyclist Marshall has so far, not been charged in the deadly collision.

Police say the Harlem saxophonist was riding in the park's bike lane when he swerved to avoid other pedestrians and hit Tarlov.

Phillip Fenton, 21, who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the New York Post: 'It didn't look like he tried to stop.'

Another witness, Tom Longman, told the newspaper 'The right side of [Tarlov's] face looked really bad. There was blood all over her.'

Marshall remained at the scene and suffered minor injuries.

According to the New York Daily News, an online training log shows that Marshall had logged speeds above the 25 miles per hour limit.

Cyclists are also supposed to slow down at crosswalks and yield to pedestrian, the Parks Department website says.
