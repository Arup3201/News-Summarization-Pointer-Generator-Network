A 15-year-old boy has died in a freak accident after he fell onto a drinking glass, slashing his neck while playing the notorious 'pass out' game in his bedroom with friends.

Copying instructions he had seen on YouTube, David Nuno lost consciousness and fell face first to the ground severing his cartoid artery at his Chula Vista, California home.

Despite bleeding profusely, the teen managed to stagger downstairs as he desperately looked for the help of his father, who was at home when the tragic experiment went wrong at around 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening.

David Nuno, 15, died after an attempt to copy the 'pass out' game went horribly wrong at his home in Chula Vista, California

Paramedics rushed to the scene and performed CPR on the stricken boy, after which he was taken to Rady Children's Hospital where he sadly later died.

Police said that David and his friends had been watching YouTube videos on how to make yourself pass out and told officers that this was the first time they had attempted the dangerous hyperventilation game.

David Nuno cut his cartoid artery on a glass tumbler that was lying on the floor in his bedroom and bled to death after he caused himself to fall unconscious playing the 'pass out' game

The teenager was tended to by his father who tried to stem the bleeding with a towel but paramedics and doctors could not save him

'The victim apparently did what was in the video, fell forward and landed on a drinking glass on the floor,' said Chula Vista Police Captain Gary Wedge.

Captain Wedge added that there was no sign of alcohol or drug taking by the boys and strongly advised young people not to immitate any 'pass out' game videos they see on the Internet.

'Nothing good can come out of watching videos like that,' said Wedge.

Immediately after David fell onto the glass tumbler, his friend's flipped his body over and told police that the boy came to and ran down their stairs for help, but collapsed on the landing.

His father attempted to hold a towel over the wound until paramedics arrived, but the cut to his neck was too deep and David lost too much blood to survive.

Videos on YouTube are uploaded by other teens and they instruct teens how to cause themselves to pass out

On Wednesday evening, dozens of the teens friends held a walking vigil for David by making the journey from Chula Vista Community Park to Nuno's home.

Some of the teen's upset friends spoke of their disbelief that he had died.

'Now that I'm seeing everyone here, I'm realising it's really true. It's not a dream,' said David's friend Jessica Alcala.

The teen's Facebook page carried rest in peace messages and high school friends spoke at the vigil of their distress.

'I couldn't comprehend what was happening,' said Mariam Valenzuela.

'I thought it was a joke. His cousin confirmed it was real.

'It was just horrible.'

David Nuno's father was home at the time of the accident in the affluent suburb of Chula Vista in San Diego

At the vigil, the teenagers friends spoke about the 'pass out' game and the dangers that come from copying internet videos.

'It's not a game. It's really serious,' said David's friend Hazel Valenzuela.

'We can use it as an example that something so little can turn into something really horrible.'

According to the medical examiner's report, David died from multiple lacerations and sharp force injuries to his neck and had just turned 15 on September 16th.

'He was very funny, very loveable,' said friend June Favela.

'A person you couldn't forget. I saw him just last week and it's so surreal.'

Psychiatrist Daniel Cowell said that parents and children must be aware of the dangers of the 'pass out' game which has caused the death of several teenagers in recent years.

In the 'pass out' game, they say, teenagers deprive themselves of oxygen until they lose consciousness and fall into friends' waiting arms, which can produce a woozy, sometimes addictive euphoria.

In 2010, two teenage girls died in the Chicago area after attaching cord to their necks to deprive themselves of oxygen, but because they played the game on their own, they hung themselves to death instead.

'Children think it's safe,' said psychiatrist Daniel Cowell, who has studied the phenomenon, 'It's far from safe.'
