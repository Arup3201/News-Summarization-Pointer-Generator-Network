England flanker James Haskell led the way on Wednesday morning as the England side were put through scrum practice ahead of their QBE Autumn International clash against Samoa.

Stuart Lancaster's side were using a Rhino Rugby Dictator, loaded with nine England players and members of the coaching staff, as the scrummagers attempted to push the impressive piece of kit from one side of a marked off area to another. 

Haskell is set to win his 51st cap against Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday as a replacement for Tom Wood in a new-look back row that should also feature Ben Morgan alongside captain Chris Robshaw.

The 29-year-old was superb against New Zealand at Eden Park in the first Test of the summer tour, but was dropped for the second and third games of the 3-0 series defeat.

England coach Lancaster looked on from a distance as the likes of George Ford and Owen Farrell were given instructions by skills coach Mike Catt. 

Speaking recently about his England recall, Haskell said: 'When I came back I reflected on that tour to New Zealand, the first Test against the All Blacks and the game against Crusaders. I had done everything I could do'.

'Now this is a huge, huge opportunity. Stuart has never led any of us to believe that this is a half-term change of personnel to test a few things out and that they're going to revert back to the team they had before.

'These are the guys he feels are going to do a job. Then it's open season for that game against Australia. I want to seize the opportunity as best I can. I'm not a good watcher of rugby and I won't leave anything in the tank.

'My mindset is to smile, revel in every moment and leave nothing in the tank.'
