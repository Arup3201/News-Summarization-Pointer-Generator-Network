Baby Gammy's Australian biological parents have revealed that they were hiding inside their Western Australia home all week, while the media camped on their door step.

David and Wendy Farnell did not shower or turn on the computer to ensure no one found out that they were hidden inside.

They remained undetected on the two occasions child protection officers came to the Bunbury home to speak with the parents, news.com.au reports.

The couple have been sought by the Western Australian Department of Child Protection, who wish to assess the Farnells suitability as parents since it was revealed that David Farnell, 56, is a convicted paedophile.

David and Wendy Farnell, the biological parents of abandoned baby Gammy, will speak on 60 minutes on Sunday night.

The Farnells also refused to come to the door when the RSPCA took the family dog away, believing the couple had left their home and abandoned their pet. The couple say they fed their dog everyday before it was taken away on Tuesday.

It is understood the Farnells have contacted the department this week.

The Australian parents of baby Gammy left their home at midnight on Wednesday.

On Thursday night, they filmed an interview with 60 minutes, pleading with Australians to 'hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them'.

60 Minutes will make a donation to the charity Hands Across The Water, but the couple were not paid for the interview.

Hands Across The Water have already raised more than $200,000 for Gammy's treatment and care. They will support Gammy until he has completed his education.

David and Wendy Farnell, who are at the centre of the surrogacy scandal that has gripped the country, will speak to 60 Minutes this Sunday about the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year.

A preview of episode shows Mr Farnell explaining, 'We wanted to bring him with us.'

In the late 1990s, Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'.

Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10.

It was not until the women were adults that they made complaints and court documents said the women had suffered 'depression' and 'difficulty forming relationships' as a result of the abuse.

But the couple, who will be interviewed on 60 Minutes on Sunday, spoke through the television program to ask 'Australia to hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them.'

Meanwhile Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, declined to give an interview with the program, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'I don't want money from them,' she said.

'I don't need their help.'

The couple's interview will come just days after one of Mr Farnell's adult children – a son from his previous marriage – spoke out in defence of his father, saying that the family had not been able to tell their side of the story for legal reasons.

Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited.

'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying.

Ms Pattaramon claims the Farnells, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister.

The Farnells initially claimed their daughter, whom they admitted was the same age as Gammy and had been born through a Thai surrogate, did not have a twin brother.

They later said they had known about the twin, but were told he only had a day to live and should say their goodbyes to the baby before they left the country, due to civil unrest.

The couple also wanted to make it known that they have been cooperating with the Department of Child Protection since Wednesday morning and will continue to cooperate with them.

They also wanted it to be known that they had been feeding their dog every day until the RSPCA took her away on Wednesday morning.
