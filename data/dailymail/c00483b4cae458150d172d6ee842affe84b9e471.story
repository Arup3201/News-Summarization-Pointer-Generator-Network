This is the moment a five-year-old realises that her little brother won't stay a baby for much longer and breaks down in tears as it dawns on her that he will one day grow up.

Sadie Miller has been captured on camera speaking about the thought of her brother Carson getting older.

But for Sadie, from Phoenix, Arizona, the prospect of Carson no longer being a baby is just too much and she starts sobbing.

As Sadie continues to sob, she pulls Carson close to give him a kiss, but the baby seems amused by his sister's ordeal

She then says: 'I don't want him to grow up', before she gives him a loving kiss on top of his head and gives him a cuddle continuing to cry.

When asked why she doesn't want her baby brother to get older she exclaims: 'Because he is just so cute!'

Her thoughts then seem to turn to herself getting older and she adds: 'And I don't want to die when I'm one hundred.'

But as Sadie, who is wearing a Princess 
Sofia outfit, continues to be hysterical the camera then shows baby 
Carson, who looks rather amused by his big sister and a big smile 
appears on his face.

But rather than his smile cheering up Sadie, she continues to sob giving him another cuddle.

She then repeats herself saying: 'Oh you are just so cute.

'I love you cute little smiles.

'Oh my gosh I want him to stay little,' she adds.

Her father Ryan says that he has no idea what prompted Sadie's hysterical crying saying it just came out of the blue
