First Nigel Farage was branded a chicken - then he was hit with an egg.

The Ukip leader's position as a member of the political establishment was confirmed as he was pelted with an egg as he arrived yesterday to campaign in Nottingham.

Now protestor Frederick Glenister - who branded Ukip 'sad, scared, old men' during the leader's visit to the town - has been charged with common assault.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage was pelted with an egg while on a visit to Nottingham

Aides were quick to bundle Mr Farage away from the scene

The incident puts Mr Farage in good 
company: David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all been 
targetted by egg throwers.

Mr Farage arrived in Nottingham to rally support for his East Midlands candidates for the European elections.

But as he got out of a car in the city centre he was hit by the egg on his left shoulder.

He quickly got back into the car which drove off leaving supporters behind.

Mr Glenister, who was holding a placard which said: 'Ukip sad, scared, old men', was put 
into a patrol car by police and driven away.

The 33-year-old, from Radford, Nottingham, was later charged with the offence and bailed to appear at the city's magistrates' court later this month.

Mr Farage, meanwhile, lived up to his 
reputation and head to the to the Bell Inn in the city centre and 
ordered a pint of Robin Hood beer.

He told reporters: 'I've been before (to the city) but today's visit was a very brief one I'm afraid. 

'I
 saw about 15 seconds of it. It's quite tough to judge. Some of the 
inhabitants are not all that friendly. I'm sure that's not the view of 
most.'

The incident happened within seconds of Mr Farage stepping out of his car and heading to meet Ukip supporters in the city

The incident came barely 24 hours after Mr Farage faced claims of being a
 'chicken' for refusing to stand in a by-election in Newark 

He accused the media of whipping up a storm around the 'injudicious, or in a couple of cases, offensive comments from a handful of people' after a series of damaging headlines about racist and sexist comments made by cancidates and supporters.

'It's whipped up this kind of storm of hatred among some on the left. 'They're organised, they're taxpayer funded and they're going around the country chasing me around trying to stop us from getting our message out.

'That is a fundamentally anti-democratic thing to do. It's not good and it's not healthy.'

Later, when asked about allegations of racism, Mr Farage said: 'It's remarkable. You've got 77% of the British population in the British Social Altitude Survey, including over 60% of first and second-generation migrants, who think we need border controls.

'The truth of it is we now have an open door to 485 million people and I want to debate that over the course of the next three weeks. I tried with Nick Clegg to debate this issue - he ignored me.

'Cameron and Miliband won't engage with it. But I think despite all the distractions, I think out there in the street people are debating it and the commonsense position is to say 'Look, immigration sensiblycontrolled can be a positive thing for society and for our economy but we must have control over the quantity and quality of those that come to our country'.

'We now have this farcical situation where if you're a skilled person from India or New Zealand, you probably won't get in because we have an open door to Romania and Bulgaria and that is absolutely mad from every perspective.

'And I think with this we're right at the centre of where the British public feels, and what we're arguing for is actually very moderate, very logical, and for the establishment to come out and cry racist shows how devoid of any other argument they are."

Mr Farage said Ukip would give people back 'their pride and their country'.

Nottinghamshire Police confirmed a man from the city has been arrested on suspicion of assault.

A force spokeswoman said: 'Police were called to a report of an assault in Wheeler Gate, Nottingham, at 1.30pm today.

'A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and is in police custody.'

The incident came barely 24 hours after Mr Farage faced claims of being a 'chicken' for refusing to stand in a by-election in Newark.

Mr Farage was smiling for the cameras as the protestor approached him and hurled the egg

Mr Farage cowered as he was struck by the egg in front of a crowd of supporters

Several Ukip visits have had to be scaled back or cancelled to avoid a clash with protesters

Mr Farage was quickly bundled into his official car before speeding off - and heading for a pub

Ukip supporters appeared alarmed by the drama which meant their party leader was quickly ferried away from the scene

He threw away the 
chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of being the Ukip candidate.

Opponents
 accused the Ukip leader of 'bottling it' and being 'frit' for not contesting the Tory seat of 
Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer.

Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves said: 'I'm not surprised that Nigel Farage doesn't want to fight in Newark.

'He
 bottles it when there's a real contest, and when he has a chance to 
prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and 
he's done that again.'

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!'

But
 Mr Farage claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would 
cause a 'distraction' from the party's bid to win the European 
Parliament elections on May 22.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has been egged several times, including on this visit to Southampton Tory leader David Cameron was hit with an egg by a student during a visit to Cornwall College in Saltash in 2010

In 2001 Labour's John Prescott threw a punch at protester Chris Evans after he hurled an egg at the then-Deputy Prime Minister

Being egged is an occupational hazard for politicians. David Cameron was targeted during a visit to Cornwall College in Saltash in 2010.

And Labour leader Ed Miliband has been egged several times, including in south London in August last year and in Southampton in May 2012.

In August 2011, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was hit with an egg containing blue paint.

The most famous political egging is probably the moment Labour's John Prescott threw a punch at protestor Chris Evans on a visit to Rhyl in north Wales in 2001.
