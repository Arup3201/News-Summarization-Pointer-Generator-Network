A transgender teenager has taken his life a year after he became the first trans student to be crowned high school homecoming king in his city.

Blake Brockington, who advocated for the rights of sexual minorities after coming out as transgender in his sophomore year, passed away on Monday night, LGBT publication QNotes reported.

The 18-year-old had been nominated and later crowned homecoming king of East Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, North Carolina last year before he graduated.

It is believed to be the first time an openly transgender student has been given the title in Charlotte, according to QNotes.

Loss: Blake Brockington, pictured as he was crowned homecoming king last year, has taken his life

Advocate: Brockington advocated for rights for sexual minorities and had led rallies against police brutality

'I honestly feel like this is something I have to do,' Brockington told the publication.

He won the title after collecting the most money for the school's chosen charity, Mothering Across Continents, and said he hoped his success would give younger transgender children, including a nine-year-old boy he mentored, strength and encouragement.

'I don't want him to ever have to be scared,' Brockington said. 'I feel like if I do this, that's one red flag for everybody to say, "Nobody should be scared to be themselves and everybody should have an equal opportunity to have an enjoyable high school experience".'

But speaking to the Charlotte Observer in January, Brockington revealed how tough the homecoming king process had been.

'That was single-handedly the hardest part of my trans journey,' he said. 'Really hateful things were said on the Internet. It was hard. I saw how narrow-minded the world really is.' 

Younger years: Brockington is pictured as a baby with a relative. He was raised as a girl but said he never felt right wearing female clothes and came out as transgender in his sophomore year of high school

Fight: Blake, pictured ahead of a rally against police brutality last year, said his biological family had struggled to accept his gender identity and that he had moved in with a foster family

He also revealed the struggles he had faced growing up as transgender  and how bad things got at home after he went to his father and stepmother and told them he was a boy.

'My family feels like this is a decision I made,' he said. 'They think, "You're already black, why would you want to draw more attention to yourself?" But it's not a decision. It is who I am. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.'

He moved in with a foster family and received counseling as he transitioned to Blake - a name he chose after it came to him in a dream - and began receiving hormone treatment.

Following his homecoming king win, he became an advocate for LGBT issues and spoke at last year's Transgender Day of Remembrance event. He also took part in rallies against police brutality. 

Winner: He was crowned as homecoming king - beating 12 other contenders - of East Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte last year after raising $3,200 for the school's chosen charity

Celebration: He said competing for the crown had been tough because he received many hateful messages online but that he wanted to show transgender children that they could be successful at school

In December, he led activists as they briefly shut down Independence Square in Charlotte before marching through Uptown, QNotes reported. 

He also took part in the high school band, where he served as drum major, and played on the student rugby team, as well as being a top-grade student. 

His Facebook page shows was a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 

His death was announced on Tuesday morning by Time Out Youth Center, a local LGBT youth services agency and confirmed by police.

Funeral arrangements have not been finalized.
