Fierce: Russian President Vladimir Putin, 62, spoke fiercely against the West in a speech Friday

Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States Friday of trying to 'remake the whole world' based on its own interests and imposing a 'unilateral diktat' on the rest of the world.

Putin spoke fiercely against the West and referred to the U.S. as the 'so-called winners of the Cold War' in a 40-minute diatribe Friday where he denied trying to rebuild the Soviet empire at the expense of Russia's neighbors. 

'Statements that Russia is trying to reinstate some sort of empire,' Putin said, 'that it is encroaching on the sovereignty of its neighbors, are groundless.'

Putin spoke to a group of political scholars known as the Valdai Club, which reportedly included Western specialists critical of him, at an annual meeting in a resort above the Black Sea city of Sochi.

Putin faulted the U.S.'s actions in conflicts including, Syria, Iraq, and Libya and said that Washington's policies do not strengthen peace and democracy.

Putin said that the U.S.'s 'unilateral diktat' and 'imposing of schemes' weaken both peace and democracy. 

Putin also accused the U.S. of trying to cast Russia in a negative light, leading people to view Russia as a danger to the rest o the world. However, Putin warns that the U.S. has made the world a dangerous place with its approach to global affairs.

Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012, and the 62-year-old president has since increasingly pushed his anti-Western views as evidenced by his harsh speech.

The speech has been called the most hostile speech Putin has given against the West and it is believed that the fiercity of his words were an effort to show Russion voters his eagerness to defend their interests. 

The criticism of the U.S. at the meeting included repeated accusations that Western governements aided pro-Western groups in staging a coup to throw a pro-Moscow leader out of office rather than a more civilized solution.

'Instead of a difficult but, I underline, civilized dialogue they brought about a state coup,' Putin said about Western governments. 'They pushed the country into chaos, economic and social collapse, and civil war with huge losses.'

Economy: Putin reportedly failed to directly address the issue of Russia's struggling economy and instead shifted the blame for the economic crisis onto global problems which he faulted the West for

Putin reportedly failed to directly address the issue of Russia's struggling economy and instead shifted the blame for the economic crisis onto global problems which he faulted the West for.

Putin said that Russia will not ask anyone for anything and does not demand a 'special, exclusive place in the world' and is 'self-sufficient.'

'While respecting interests of others,' Putin said, 'we simply want our interests to be taken into account too, and our position to be respected.'
