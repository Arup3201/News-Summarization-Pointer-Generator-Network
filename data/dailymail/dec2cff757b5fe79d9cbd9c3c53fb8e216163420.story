Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has told a court his wife stole government funds without his involvement and revealed how the couple became estranged after he had an affair.

The courtroom revelations in Xilai's politically charged corruption trial have already exposed information about one of China's elite families. 

However, for the first time, the 64-year-old was forced to disclose details of his family and how his wife Gu Kailai had taken their son to Britain after discovering he had been having an affair.

According to a journalist who was imprisoned for digging up information about Bo, he had an affair with a secretary in her 20s called Li and spent so much time with other women he was nicknamed 'Erect Mr Bo' - or Bo Qilai.

Bo's wife travelled to Poole, in Dorset, in 2000, where she lived with her confidant Patrick Devillers, a French architect, and her son who was enrolled at Papplewick School, near Ascot.

It was unheard of a child of the a communist party leader to go to a foreign prep school.

Bo agreed to take legal responsibility for the fact £500,000 of public money had made its way into his wife's bank account. 

'I am ashamed of it. I was too careless, because this is public money,' Bo told the Jinan Intermediate People's Court.

'I failed to retrieve the money later, and that's a factual statement, but can you say I had the intention to embezzle the money? No.'

It has been said that the ruling Communist Party is using the trial against Bo, a former Politburo member and party leader of the city of Chongqing, to cap a messy political scandal after his wife was convicted for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in August 2012.

That scandal led to Bo's political ousting, cemented by criminal charges of interfering with a murder investigation and netting £2.76 million through corruption. 

Courts in China are controlled by the Communist Party so a conviction is expected, but Bo has mounted an unexpectedly spirited defence.

Bo's trial had been expected to be swift, but observers say giving him a chance to defend himself helps lend a veneer of legitimacy to what is widely seen as a political show trial. 

'The leadership wants to have a trial that's seen as fair. You can't have a completely secret trial in today's China, it would be an embarrassment,' said Brookings Institution scholar Cheng Li. 

'Bo Xilai is taking advantage of that trial to continue to perform as he did before.'

Authorities remained on high alert for any unrest that might be triggered by the trial, closely guarding a security perimeter that expanded several miles around the court with main roads in the vicinity sealed and many shops and restaurants shut.

Inside the courtroom, Bo questioned the testimonies of his wife Gu Kailai and others that prosecutors presented, that in 2000 he had told Gu to take the government funds to cover the expenses of accompanying their son in Britain while he attended school. 

Bo said that Gu had piles of her own money, and that she had taken their son overseas in a fit of rage after he had been unfaithful.

'She left after giving me only the courtesy of a notification,' Bo said. 'At the time, I had had an affair, and she was very angry. She took Bo Guagua away, largely because she felt wronged and was acting rashly.'

He said Gu, who is serving a suspended death sentence, could be seeking a more lenient jail term by denouncing him.

Bo similarly questioned the testimony of Wang Zhenggang, who was then an official with a land planning department in Dalian, where Bo was party boss at the time. 

Wang had testified that Bo made a call to his wife in front of him and explicitly said he was going to funnel 5 million yuan ( 800,000) in funds from a government project to their family, an account Bo called implausible.

'Is this in line with the way an embezzler would think?' Bo said of the account of the alleged event that took place 13 years ago in Dalian. 

'Would I say something this sensitive on the phone?'

Prosecutors have also said that he accepted bribes from businessmen in the form of money or gifts to his family - including a villa in Nice, France, and plane tickets to three continents - in exchange for political favours.

The charges of bribery and embezzlement, based on the indictment's specified monetary amounts, carry penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment, or death in severe cases, while the abuse of power charge could result in up to seven years' imprisonment.

The trial on Saturday also began hearing allegations that Bo interfered in the investigation of the murder of a British businessman and of the events surrounding his top aide's attempted defection at a U.S. consulate.

Courtroom revelations by the prosecution have laid bare the way shady ties between powerful officials and businessmen can play out in China. 

Part of the couple's influence comes from their pedigree as the children of revolutionary veterans, a status that gives them access to important political and business networks.
