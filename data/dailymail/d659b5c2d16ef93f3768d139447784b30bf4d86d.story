A prosecutor says the Utah neighbours of a dead teenage girl who mysteriously vanished six weeks ago while babysitting are now 'persons of interest' in the case and charges could come next month.

North Ogden police say 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen vanished on September 10 after babysitting for neighbourhood couple Eric and Dea Millerberg, who are both currently behind bars on other charges.

Authorities found Miss Rasmussen's body in a shallow grave on October 18 near Interstate 84 east of Ogden.

Weber County Attorney Dee Smith is now
calling the couple 'persons of interest' after 36-year-old Eric 
Millerberg was sent back to prison on Tuesday for violating his 
probation in a 2010 fraud case. Millerberg's wife remains jailed after 
being charged on October 7 with two prescription fraud felonies.

A telephone message for Eric Millerberg's attorney was not immediately returned.

He was repeatedly in prison from 1997 to 2006 for burglary, discharge of a firearm and failure to stop at the command of police, according to Department of Corrections records.

The Salt Lake Tribune also reported he was affiliated with Silent Aryan Warrios, a white supremacist prison gang group.

He was originally convicted of forgery
and credit card fraud when he was arrested for having drugs. He did not
reference the disappearance of Miss Rasmussen during his court 
appearance.

He claimed to have a prescription for 
oxycodone, which police found in his possession. 'I have pains. I have a
metal plate in my neck and six screws,' he told the judge.

Millerberg was ordered to return to prison, where he is expected to serve up to a five year sentence.

Discovery: The body was found at a rural site north of Salt Lake City on Tuesday and was identified on Saturday

Search: Police had been looking for the 16-year-old since she vanished while babysitting on September 10

Earlier this week Smith said the public should not be fearing a killer at-large.

'I am confident police do know who is 
responsible for her death,’ he told the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘I don’t 
think (the suspects) are in a position where the general public needs to
be worried about them.'

Authorities are waiting for the 
results of an autopsy to decide on what the suspects will be charged 
with - and this could take at least a month, so the investigation will 
probably stretch into December.

'The body's disposal suggests foul 
play, but I can’t say to what degree,’ Mr Smith told the Tribune, adding
investigators believe she died soon after she disappeared and this is a
'homicide'.

Students at Weber High School were 
distraught at their classmate’s death and many went home as they were so
upset on Monday. 'Everyone is crying,' Juliette Swenson, 16, told the 
Tribune.

The family of the girl last week said:
'Our beautiful Alexis is sadly gone' and they paid tribute to her on a 
Facebook page set up during the search to find her, saying they had 
'endured a catastrophe.'

Memories: Fellow students at Weber High School said that they were shocked and devastated

'(It) has changed each of us in ways 
that are far beyond words,' they said. 'Alexis touched so many people in
the past 50 days, just as she did in the time she was here.

‘Life will never be the same. Now 
sadly we mourn for the loss of our baby girl, as a family we will slowly
try to heal, knowing we will never fully recover'

'Life will never be the same. Now 
sadly we mourn for the loss of our baby girl, as a family we will slowly
try to heal, knowing we will never fully recover.'

The Utah State Medical Examiner's 
Office on Saturday confirmed through fingerprint and dental records that
the body found at a rural site on Tuesday was that of Alexis.

Family members had acknowledged that 
Alexis ran away before, and police previously said they were treating 
the investigation as a missing person case.

A tip from a confidential informant 
led police to the grave site in Morgan County, a rural county north of 
Salt Lake City. The tip was directly related to the investigation into 
the girl's disappearance.

Police said the girl was last seen 
when she was babysitting on September 10, but she reportedly left before
midnight to meet a friend. Officers talked to that boy, but said he 
claims he only texted Alexis that night and did not meet her.
