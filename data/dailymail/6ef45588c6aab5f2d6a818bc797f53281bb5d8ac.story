A small group of 'made men' with mob ties are raking in more than $400,000 a year as humble dockworkers at ports in New York and New Jersey, a new report reveals.

These longshoremen are being paid for working 24 hour a day, seven days a week -- even though they only show up at work as little as 30 hours a week for their cushy gigs.

These huge, inexplicable salaries come as the Port Authority shells out hundreds of millions of dollars in public money to upgrade the ports so goods can continue to flow into and out of the New York area.

The New York Post has named three men with ties to known mobsters who have raked in huge sums of money for working so-called 'low-show' jobs that continue to weigh down New York's ports with unnecessary labor costs.

For more than 60 years, organized crime has had a presence in the shady underbelly of the ports.

The Waterfront Commission, which issued the report naming the three men, was established in the 1950s because the Gambino crime family controlled the ports in New York and the Genovese family looked after the New Jersey ports.

Ralph Gigante is a union shop steward who was paid $406,659 last year, despite having base wages of $36 an hour. He testified that he works as few as 30 hours a week, but get paid whenever any of the dockworkers he oversees are on the job. That's 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Gigante doesn't have to be working and doesn't even have to be in the state to be paid.

His sole job duty is safeguarding the 
union rights of the workers under him. Despite this, he testified under 
oath that he has never read the union's contract in its entirety. And in
17 years on the job, he's only filed one union grievance, the Post 
reported.

Gigante inherited the job, which includes unlimited vacation and guaranteed overtime pay every day, from his cousin.

Gigante is the nephew of Vincent 'the 
Chin' Gigante, a Genovese boss who was once the most powerful mobster in
the country before he was sent to prison on murder and racketeering 
charges.

Vincent Gingante was the father-in-law of Joseph Colonna, another high-paid dockworker.

Last year, Colonna was paid $401,105 for working as a mechanics foreman at APM Terminals at Port Newark.

And
Paul Buglioli, whose dockworker father was a friend of Genovese mobster
Nicholas Purina, was paid $474,947 last year to simply manage the time 
cards of employees at a Ports of America terminal in Newark, the Post 
reported.

It requires no special education or training and includes little manual labor.

Ralph Gigante, for one, defended his wages.

'(His)
compensation is determined contractually, and the Waterfront Commission
only brings up his name in this context so they can talk about his 
family and other issues that have absolutely nothing to do with him,‚Äù 
his lawyer Gerald Krovatin told the Post.

According to the Waterfront Commission, up to 40 percent of dockworkers are being paid without actually doing any work at any given time.

Meanwhile, Ralph Gigante's employer, Port Newark Container Terminal, received $150 million in capital improvement money from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- the agency that regulates and oversee ports, airports, bridges, tunnels and trains between the two states.

APM Terminals, the Dutch company that pays Colonna, received $30 million in public money from the Port Authority and a $144 million loan in 2000.

'At a time the container terminal industry says it is struggling and asking for substantial Port Authority subsidy in our harbor, the industry must help itself by eliminating "low- show jobs,"' Pat Foye, the Port Authority's new executive director told the Post.
