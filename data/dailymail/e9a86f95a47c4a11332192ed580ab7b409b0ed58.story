An employee of an armed security company opened fire on a co-worker before fatally shooting himself on Monday morning in what is being investigated as an attempted murder-suicide.

The surviving victim was shot four times and was listed in critical condition at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, according to Moorestown police Lieutenant Lee Lieber. The victim was conscious when he was airlifted to the hospital.

The incident began in a work area at Shields Business Solutions in Burlington County around 7am when both men had a conversation upon arriving for work.

Following the altercation, the shooter then shot himself in the area behind the building's rear parking lot, said Lieber. 

It has been reported that only one of the men had a weapon. 

'None of the employees had any weapons at the time this occurred. They check them in and out, except for the one subject who was deemed the shooter,' said Lieber.

The identities of the victims were not immediately released and Lieber would not confirm the roles of the men at the company, which provides armored car, ATM and security services.

The shooting remains under investigation.
