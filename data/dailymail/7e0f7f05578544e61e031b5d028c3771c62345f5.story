Donna Air has revealed that her grandfather is suffering from dementia and is being cared for in a hospice.

In a rare interview, Miss Air, 35, who is in a relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother James Middleton, spoke about the impact 'Grandpa Joe's' diagnosis has had on her family..

Miss Air, who rose to fame on teenage drama Byker Grove, said the illness has left him unable to recall her name at times but says she tries to 'make light of the sad times'.

Upsetting: Donna Air has revealed that her grandfather is suffering from dementia in a rare interview

'My grandfather has dementia,' she said. 'But it is life, and the family, in the northern style that we are, we find the nice parts and the humour and all that kind of thing. 

'Sometimes you have to make light of the sad times. It is awful and I’m sure, if it happens to me my grandchildren, they have permission to make fun of Granny Donna.

‘I think you just have to do what you need to do in those situations. And all my family up north, it’s lucky, my grandfather has a really big Catholic family, so there’s lots of offspring who will take their part in looking after him.'

Tragically however, the family has had to come to terms with the fact that he often struggles to recall the names of his children and grandchildren. c   

Miss Air said they use humour to help themselves cope. 'One of the jokes actually, sometimes when I go home to visit he goes “hello pet, hello Donna.”

'And they all go “oh, we might have known he’d remember you, the favourite one” lots of jokes like that. 

'Whoever he remembers we make a joke “oh, might have known you’d be the one he’d remember”. So I always tease my relatives, “he’ll definitely remember me” as a joke. And it’s just pot luck.’

An unusually candid Miss Air also admitted to being unsure exactly how old her grandfather is – ‘grandparents just seem to have a generic age,’ she said.

But she expressed joy at the fact her 11-year-old daughter Freya, whose father is her ex-partner Damian Aspinall, has known her great grandparents.

'It’s incredible, it’s amazing,' she enthused. 'I don’t remember meeting my great grandparents. So she’s very lucky.’

Miss Air is one of a number of celebrities to speak about dementia in recent months, including Mariella Frostrup, 51, Fiona Phillips, 53, Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, Arlene Phillips, 71, and Angela Rippon, 69, all of whom have lost parents to the disease.

The former actress, a long-standing philanthropist, made her comments during Hospice Care Week, as she helped launch a new charity website.

Care2save.co.uk, which stocks six million products from more than 2,000 retailers including Topshop, Travelodge and mobile phone company O2, donates the commission it makes on sales, with a portion of the money going to the care industry.

And Miss Air, who has in the past supported a range of other health charities including Macmillan Cancer Support and Jeans for Genes, said it was her grandfather’s illness her sparked her interest in the cause.

‘My grandfather is in a home, in a hospice,' she said. 'So I think any care that you can give and you know what, it’s not just people in hospices as well.

'They actually put the funds into people who need care at home too. So it’s just one of those things I feel a responsibility for.'

Excitement: Like James, she is eagerly awaiting the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's second child

Dementia, which can cause severe memory loss and confusion, is most prevalent among older people and affects one in six people over the age of 80, takes on many different forms, the most common being Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.

A spokesperson for the Alzheimer’s Society, which is the largest dementia charity, said: 'A diagnosis of dementia can be very emotional both for the individual and their families. 

'However, it is possible to live well with dementia and go on enjoying life with the right care and support. 

'Timely diagnosis is vital and equally important is the need for greater investment in services for people with the condition. 

'We would urge anyone who is concerned about dementia to speak to their GP today or contact Alzheimer's Society’s helpline for advice.'
