Walmart says actor-comedian Tracy Morgan and other people in a vehicle struck from behind by a company truck on a New Jersey highway in June weren't wearing seatbelts and therefore to blame for their own injuries.

Walmart's filing was made Monday in federal court in response to a lawsuit Morgan, and the other passengers in his limo bus, filed in July.

Morgan's friend James McNair was killed in the crash while accompanying the 45-year-old former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries.

His fault? Walmart is blaming Tracy Morgan for the injuries he sustained in June when a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart Stores Inc. says the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says constitutes unreasonable conduct.

If they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized.'

An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs hasn't commented.

Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash.

The company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control.' 

After the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it was too late.

'[The] driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.'

Walmart responded to a lawsuit filed by Morgan and the other survivors, saying they are not to blame for the injuries since the passengers weren't wearing seatbelts
