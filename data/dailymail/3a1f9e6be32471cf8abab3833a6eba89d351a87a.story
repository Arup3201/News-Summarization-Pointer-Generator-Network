If you've ever dreamed of having a fairytale wedding, your wish has been granted - thanks to a new edible invention.

At Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings Expo this weekend, the company unveiled a brand new creation: a tiered wedding cake with animations projected onto its surface.

In a video demonstrating how it works, an animated Tinkerbell is seen flying across the surface of the cake, sprinkling fairy dust all over it.

The technology used to map animation onto the cake is similar to the kind Disney uses in its nightly light shows at Magic Kingdom and Disneyland. 

And the animation that can be projected onto your wedding cake isn't limited to just Disney characters.

In fact, the light show can be customized, letting couples create their own special love story for their wedding guests to watch. 

These fairytale cakes are available as part of Disney's Wishes Collection' wedding package, which starts at $12,000.

Couples who sign up for the package can choose to have their wedding in a Disney park in Florida, Disneyland California, Disney Resort and Spa in Hawaii, or aboard a Disney cruise line.

'Today's couples are looking for that customization and they want to look unique, and they want to do something amazing at their wedding,' a woman says in the demonstration video. 'We have the perfect solution for you.'

She explains that the images are projected onto a blank canvas on the cake, which is perfectly edible.

And when it comes to cutting the cake, couples can do it while the animation is playing - as long as they stand behind it so as not to block the light.
