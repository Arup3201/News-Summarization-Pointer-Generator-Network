This is the moment murderer Michael Adebolajo told police that he had run over and hacked to death Lee Rigby 'by Allah's decree'.

The chilling video can be shown for the first time today after an Old Bailey jury took just 90 minutes to find Adebolajo and accomplice Michael Adebowale guilty of murdering the father-of-one and the attempted murder of police.

The disturbing footage shows the 28-year-old extremist wrapped in a blanket with a copy of the Koran in front of him, offering no emotion or remorse for his terrible crime.

Instead he coldly explained to officers that the Fusilier died just because 'he was the soldier that was spotted first' in Woolwich on May 22 this year.

Cold and calculated: A new video released today shows Michael Adebolajo explaining to police that he and Michael Adebowale killed Lee Rigby at the 'command of Allah'

Adebolajo
 - who described himself as a 'soldier of Allah' - also said that Rigby 
would have understood that by joining the Army his life would always be 
in danger, even in Britain.

'We decided to wait in the vicinity of the barracks that is in Woolwich,' he said.

Testimony: Michael Adebolajo said he loved Al Qaeda and said its members were his 'brothers'

'By
 the command of Allah, by Allah's decree, whilst waiting to find a 
soldier because between us we decided that the soldier is the most fair 
target because he joins the Army with kind of an understanding that your
 life is at risk when you join, you know.

'So we sat in wait and it just so happened that he was the soldier that was spotted first'.

Adebolajo
 had just been released from hospital after a week of lifesaving 
treatment, having charged police swinging a meat cleaver before before 
being shot by armed officers.

The interview from June 1, 
played to the court, shows British born Adebolajo has adopted an accent, although from time to time he slips back into his London accent.

‘When I thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible to kill a man by driving into him,’ he said.

‘When
 he crossed the road in front of me so casually it was almost as if I 
was not in control of myself. I accelerated, I hit him and I think I 
also crashed into a sign post.’

Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death

He
 went on: ‘We did not wish to give him much pain - I could see he was 
still alive. We exited the vehicle and I am not sure how I struck the 
first blow.

‘The most 
humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular, this is what I 
believe, this is how we kill our animals in Islam. He may be my enemy 
but he is a man - so I struck at the neck and attempted to remove his 
head.’

He said he 
thought Fusilier Rigby was the ‘non-Muslim version of myself and my 
brother Ismail [ie Adebowale]’, adding: ‘To be killed on the battlefield
 is not something we shy away from and in fact this is something that 
Allah loves.’

'Brutal': The two men accused of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (second right) hacked at Lee Rigby like 'he was a tree', witnesses said

Earlier in
 the video, Adebolajo insisted that the alleged killing was not ‘a 
personal vendetta’, and said he would like to speak to the dead 
soldier’s family.

‘I 
have never met the family of Lee Rigby’, he said. ‘Quite possibly I may 
have walked past one of them in the street. I do not hate them. I do not
 hate them, nor does my brother Ismail, he does not. This is not a 
personal vendetta.’

Adebolajo appeared to break down for a few seconds as he recalled the events and muttered: ‘Forgive me, OK'
