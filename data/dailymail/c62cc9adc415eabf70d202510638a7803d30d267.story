Arsenal face an untimely injury crisis as they prepare to open their Champions League campaign for another season with one of the toughest trips in Europe on Tuesday night.

The Gunners will come up against Borussia Dortmund and the famous 'Yellow Wall' at the Westfalenstadion and will have to do so without a number of key personnel in defence.

Summer buy Mathieu Debuchy will be out for two months after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester City and Nacho Monreal did not make the trip to Germany.

Calum Chambers is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated '50-50', leaving Arsene Wenger with a patched-up defence.

One of those set to step in is 19-year-old Hector Bellerin, but who is the young star set for a baptism of fire in one of Europe's most intimidating arenas.

Arsene Wenger faces a selection dilemma in defence after injuries to Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and Nacho Monreal, meaning that Bellerin could start at right-back in the Westfalenstadion

NAME: Hector Bellerin

AGE: 19

CLUB: Arsenal

POSITION: Right-back

I'm going to need more than that...

Hector Bellerin certainly won't be fazed by the prospect of stepping out in front of 80,000 fans at the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday night.

This is a player who has been crafted for big occasions like this, first at Barcelona and then at Arsenal, and is going places in his career - very quickly.

His performances on the right-hand side of defence for Arsenal's Under 21 side over the last couple of seasons caught the eye of Arsene Wenger and the manager clearly feels Bellerin is ready to make the leap into the first team.

He also gained valuable experience - and impressed plenty - in his eight Championship appearances for Watford during the middle of last season.

The highlight came at Elland Road, when Bellerin's lung-busting 70 yard run from the edge of his own penalty area helped create a goal for Cristian Battochio in a 3-3 draw.

Bellerin made his one and only first team appearance in the League Cup at West Brom last season. He came on in extra time for Mikel Arteta and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role

Wenger recalled him from that loan spell at Vicarage Road in February but his only senior appearance to date was in the League Cup win at West Brom last season, when he came on for the injured Mikel Arteta and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role.

Barcelona-born Bellerin is at his best when allowed to carry the ball forward from his right-back position. He has pace in abundance and the way the ball sticks to his feet betrays his football education both in Catalonia and north London.

His name hit the headlines when he broke Theo Walcott's record over the 40m sprint, making him technically the fastest player to ever play for the club. Walcott had earlier stolen the crown from Thierry Henry.

It's perhaps explained by the fact he was originally a winger at Barcelona, converting into a right-back only when he moved to London in the summer of 2011.

Bellerin explained all in an August 2012 interview: 'When I was at Barcelona I always used to play on the right-wing.

'But last year I learnt a lot from Steve Bould about how to defend and every day I feel more and more comfortable as a right-back.'

Bellerin is well known to the die-hards who watch the Under 21 side and the UEFA Youth League at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park.

He contributed two goals and an assist in his seven Under 21 Premier League outings last season either side of his Watford loan and played in all but two of Arsenal's maiden Youth League campaign.

With Wenger watching on at the Emirates a couple of weeks ago, he delivered an inch-perfect cross for Chuba Akpom to head in the second of his hat-trick in the Under 21s 4-2 win over West Brom.

His energetic performance in that game - and another in front of the Sky TV cameras when Arsenal beat Aston Villa 2-0 last Thursday - was sufficient to confirm to Wenger that he is ready.

What about international honours?

Bellerin is currently a Spain Under 19 international and has made eight appearances so far.

He previously represented his country at Under 16 and Under 17 level, receiving his first cap in 2011.

He blotted his copybook at the European Under 19 Championship in Lithuania, getting sent off in Spain opening match with Portugal and was not able to appear again until the semi-finals.

Bellerin played the entire match against France but his team were eliminated 2-1 after extra time, ending their title defence.

What's his style?

Bellerin's natural instinct is to bomb forward when in possession of the ball, getting white paint on his boots and taking on defenders.

This is all well and good in Under 21 matches but Bellerin will have to show greater discipline if selected against Dortmund.

Against Jurgen Klopp's talented side, if he goes all gung-ho and gets stranded up the pitch, Arsenal could be left exposed.

Wenger will certainly stress this in his pre-match team talk and Bellerin will have to cocnentrate on his defensive duties.

While we possibly won't see much evidence of it on Tuesday, Bellerin is an exciting player to watch going forward and, as mentioned, is sometimes hard to differentiate from a flying winger.

He has dramatic acceleration that leaves opponents trailing, skills, trickery and a magnetic touch. He is also adept at picking out forwards with his crossing.

In terms of the defensive attributes, Bellerin is sound too. His tracking back and tackling are of the standard you would expect and will yet be further polished with greater experience.

He does sometimes get caught out of position when the opposition counter-attack but at least has the pace to track back.

What happens next?

Hopefully, Bellerin can produce a strong performance if given the responsibility against Dortmund and raise his profile.

With Debuchy out for a while, this is a superb opportunity for him to impress in the first team and give Wenger a selection headache.

Even if he doesn't feature in Germany, there are plenty of matches coming up in which he should play.

At 19, he still has plenty of time on his side and there's no doubt he is very highly-regarded by Wenger and everyone at the club.
