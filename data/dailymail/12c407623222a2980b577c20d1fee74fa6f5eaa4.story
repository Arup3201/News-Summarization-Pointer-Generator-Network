If the trio are excluded from the win, the remaining syndicate members will receive another £14,000 each

A lottery syndicate that won £1million are locked in a dispute today over how to share the money after three members are accused of not paying for the ticket.

The 16 colleagues from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) were each due to receive £62,500 after they won the EuroMillions draw on Friday. 

But in a drama reminiscent of the BBC series The Syndicate, the group are arguing about how to divide the winnings after three members had not paid.

Lottery operators Camelot were today trying to mediate in the row and senior officials at the DVLA
have become involved.

If they exclude the workers who have not paid up the remaining members stand to gain an extra £14,423 each.

In
the BBC drama, written by Kay Mellor, the winners have  to decide 
whether to give a share to a member who had not paid his share for five 
weeks.

A DVLA worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'It’s like something out of that television show, I can’t believe the way they are acting.

'There is an office syndicate who group together and buy tickets - no one could believe it when they won.

'The win has gone a bit sour though as there are three people who the others say haven’t paid for their tickets.

'It’s all a bit awkward and there’s a bad atmosphere - it’s terrible how people can turn so nasty when a bit of money is involved.'

More than 5,000 people work at the DVLA offices in Morriston, Swansea.

It is thought the DVLA workers will hold a vote as they do not have a syndicate contract.

The National Lottery recommend players draw up paperwork in the event of such a dispute arising.

On their website is says: 'It’s important to draw up a group agreement in preparation of that big win.'

They offer templates on their website 
allowing people to decide contribution per draw, share of winnings and 
what happens if someone fails to contribute.

Camelot are mediating in the row between the 16-strong syndicate at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea

Workers at the offices said today they have been sworn to secrecy by bosses.

An email was sent around warning staff that disciplinary action could be taken if the winners’ identities were revealed.

The Department of Transport denied that security officers were called to the room where the winners work after a row broke out.

A spokesman said: 'There have been suggestions that there were some disruption in the office and security had to be called in. I can state that there is no truth in that.'

A National Lottery spokesman said because the syndicate had chosen to remain anonymous they could not comment on the dispute.

Simon Horn, of the National Lottery, said a winning lottery ticket is owned by the individual that bought it and not by a syndicate.

He said: 'We pay that individual after they sign the back of the winning ticket.

'So any splitting of the winnings between a syndicate is done by the individual winner.

'That is why we encourage every syndicate to sign a syndicate agreement form.'

Mr Horn said it was very rare for people to fall out over a shared win.

He said: 'In seven years I have met a lot of different winners and come across very few disputes.

'People are normally very happy to have won and it adds something to the experience to share it - more than it takes something away from the win.'
