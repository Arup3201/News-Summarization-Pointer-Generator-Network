Colombian bombshell Sofia Vergara once again stunned on the red carpet as she attended this year's Vanity Fair Oscar party on the arm of her fiance, Magic Mike actor Joe Manganiello.

Wearing a dress from Zuhair Murad's Spring/Summer 2015 Ready-to-Wear collection, Sofia was the third celebrity to wear the designer to the Oscars, joining Jennifer Lopez and Chrissy Teigen in turning heads on the read carpet!

Pale blue isn't the easiest color to wear and can wash some people out, so the added embellishments and embroidery on this dress is perfect for adding a touch of va va voom.

Below we bring you our favorite embellished pale blue dresses from across the web - we especially love the ASOS Embellished sleeve maxi and the Virgos Lounge off the shoulder number.

Joe will be busy this summer promoting his new film, the sequel to Magic Mike with Channing Tatum

'Hopefully we will do it later this year, we want to do it when we can make time for a honeymoon.'

The pair were wrapped around each other at the party, where the A list crowd included Beyonce and Jay Z, Jennifer Aniston and Oscar winners Julianne Moore and Eddie Redmayne.

Joking about having had an illicit liaison inside the photo booth, their chemistry was there for all to see. And speaking about their upcoming wedding, Joe- who recently wrapped filming on Magic Mike 2 with Channing Tatum - said: 'I would love to get married this summer, but I'm going to be too busy promoting my male stripper movie!'

Asked how it differs from the first movie, Joe said: 'It's incredible, you'll watch it and you won't remember the first film.'

And asked about any comparisons between Magic Mike and 50 Shades of Grey, Joe laughed: 'It's a different vibe, this is fun and sexy.'
