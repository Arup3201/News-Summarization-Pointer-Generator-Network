King Harold, William the Conqueror and Norwegian king Harold Hardrada may not have all spoken in a Welsh accent... but that hasn't stopped one creative teacher from bringing them to life for the sake of education.

David Perkins is giving history lessons by dressing up as famous characters from the past - and filming them on YouTube for his pupils.

The 28-year-old turned to fancy dress as he feared his students were bored by studying through traditional books and the blackboard. 

Mr Perkins, who is head of history at Duffryn High School in Newport, South Wales, bought a box of wigs and made some colourful costumes to film himself acting out the lives of the great historical figures.

David Perkins, head of history at Duffryn High School in Newport, South Wales, has become a YouTube hit after posting videos of himself as historical characters to teach his pupils

One costume change later, and he is transformed into William The Conqueror as he gives a lesson on the contenders to the English throne in 1066

Mr Perkins gets into the character of Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (who bears more than a passing resemblance to Roy Wood from Wizzard singing I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day)

And he told his class of 11 to 13-year-olds: 'Go home and log onto YouTube.'

His one-man historical dramas have become so popular on the internet site they are getting thousands of hits.

Mr Perkins said: 'I just wanted to try a new way of presenting history and what better than YouTube?

'The kids love to see teachers making fun of themselves and they just seem more receptive - it’s had a really good reaction.'

He begins by having three contenders for the English throne sit down and, in the style of a job interview, explain why they should by king in 1066.

The teacher started off dressing up as William the Conqueror for the Battle of Hastings.

He also disguised himself as the last Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, who died after an arrow pierced his eye in the battle.

And he also played Norwegian King Harald Hardrada, who was involved in the same year in a struggle for the English crown.

Dressed in a red cape and white beard, the 'Scandinavian' proclaims to his pupils: 'When I fight wars I win wars, I am a brilliant leader.'

Mr Perkins also filmed himself as medieval priest Martin Luther and a mythical monk by the name of Friar Perkins.

He admits his performances are not up to the standards of Cate Blanchett or Glenda Jackson.

But pupils at Duffryn High School said he has brought history lessons alive.

Mr Perkins added: 'The children love using computers and mobile phones so I thought I’d try and reach them that way.

'You need to change things you are doing with the kids - if you don’t keep it fresh, it’s like everything - it becomes old and boring.

'We need to change the rules of how we deliver.'

Costumes were made by his freelance fashion designer girlfriend Carley Jones, along with a few cheap wigs brought from supermarkets and second-hand shops.

David said: 'I don’t have a script - I just go in front of the camera and wing it - although we’ve had to stop filming a couple of times because I am prone to get the giggles.'

The 1,200-pupil Duffryn High School is no stranger to cameras - an episode of Doctor Who was filmed there.
