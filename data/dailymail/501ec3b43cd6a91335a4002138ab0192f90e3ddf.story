President Barack Obama on Friday honored the four Americans killed in an
 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, recalling their lives in deeply 
personal terms and declaring the United States will never pull back on 
its principles or 'retreat from the world.'

The coffins of the four men were brought back to the United States on a military transport plane this afternoon and carried by serving officers to waiting hearses parked under a giant hanging Stars and Stripes.

'Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. We will bring to justice those who took them from us,' said 
President Barack Obama during his speech in front of the dead men's family. 'Chris Stevens was everything America could want in an ambassador,' he added.

'The United States of America will never retreat from the world,' continued the president.

'We will
 never stop working for the dignity and freedom that every (person) 
deserves. ... That’s the essence of American leadership. ... That was 
their work in Benghazi, and that is the work we will carry on.'

Opening his tribute to the dead consulate staff members, Mr Obama spoke of Christopher Stevens and said he, 'was everything America could want in an ambassador.'

'Four Americans, four patriots. They loved this country. They chose 
to serve it, and served it well,' said Obama.

He also spoke movingly about Department of State employee Sean Smith and the two former Navy SEALS Glen A. Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods who also perished in the attack.

'They had a mission they 
believed in. They knew the danger, and they accepted it.

'They didn't 
simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it; they embodied it. The 
courage, the hope, and yes, the idealism - that fundamental American 
belief that we could leave this world a little better than before.

'That's who they were, and that's who we are. If we want to truly honor their memory, that's who we must always be.'

At the beginning and at the end of his remarks, Obama cited John 
15:13 from the Bible: 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends.'

Obama said the four dead Americans 
laid down their lives 'in service to us all.'

'Their sacrifice will never be forgotten,' said President Obama.

Speaking before 
the president, a clearly emotional Secretary of State Hilary Clinton 
offered up thanks to the four U.S. citizens who died after the Benghazi 
consulate was stormed on September the 11th.

'They didn't 
simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it; they embodied it. If we want to truly honor their memory, that's who we must always be.'

-President Obama

'Today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our values,' said Clinton.  'To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and deepest gratitude.'

The transfer of remains came three days after an attack on the 
consulate, one of a series of assaults on U.S. outposts in Muslim 
countries that U.S. officials blame on an anti-Muslim video made in the 
United States.

Clinton said the rage and violence aimed at 
American missions was prompted by 'an awful Internet video that we had 
nothing to do with.'

Clinton praised Sean Smith and ex Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods as someone who she knew personally.

'He had the hands 
of a healer as well as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a 
registered nurse and certified paramedic,' said Clinton of Woods.

Clinton also 
hailed the other ex-Navy SEAL, Glen Doherty. 'He, too, died as he lived,
 serving his country and protecting his colleagues.'

The Secretary of 
State said Stevens, 'won friends for the United States in far-flung 
places,' and thanked his parents, who were at the ceremony, for the 
'gift' that Stevens was.

Clinton and Obama both spoke of how the four men lived their lives — and how their mission would go on.

'This
 work, and the men and women who risk their lives to do it, are at the 
heart of what makes America great and good," Clinton said. 'So we will 
wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted.'

Also attending the ceremony were Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.

The searing images of burning flags, breached embassies and smoldering cars have shocked the nation.

The
 deaths on Tuesday, the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist 
attacks, and the anti-American sentiment behind them underscored a 
foreign policy paradox for Obama.

Many of the protests in the Arab world
 were in countries that underwent Obama-backed revolutions during the 
Arab Spring.

Illustrating the volatility, Friday's ceremony 
unfolded as a Marine rapid response team arrived in Yemen's capital as 
protests erupted there.

In addition to Stevens, the ceremony also 
honored three other Americans killed in Benghazi — Smith, an Air Force 
veteran who worked as an information management specialist for the State
 Department; Doherty, a former Navy SEAL who worked for a private 
security firm and was protecting the consulate in Benghazi; and Woods, 
also a former Navy SEAL who had served protective duty in various U.S. 
posts.

Following
 the 'transfer of remains' ceremony, the bodies were to be flown to a 
military mortuary at an air base in Dover, Delaware.

Stevens, who went by the first name Chris, had only been appointed as 
Libyan ambassador by President Obama in January. It came after an 
esteemed career within the United States foreign service which spanned 
more than two decades.

Speaking outside the White House on 
Wednesday, President Obama hailed Stevens and the three other U.S. 
officials who died in the attack as devoted to working for democracy.

'It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi as it's a city that he helped to save,' Obama said.

With 'characteristic skill, courage 
and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyans... and he worked 
tirelessly to support this young democracy.

'He was a role model to those who worked with him and to the young diplomats who strive to follow in his footsteps.'
