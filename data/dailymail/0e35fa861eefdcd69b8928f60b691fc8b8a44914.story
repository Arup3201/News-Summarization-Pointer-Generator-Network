A jealous husband stabbed his wife in the neck 19 times with such force part of the blade broke, in an honour killing because he resented her 'Westernised' lifestyle, learning she had been unfaithful.

Muslim takeaway delivery driver Jahangir Nazar murdered Farkhanda Younis after flying into an uncontrollable rage when he discovered she had returned home after having sex with one of her lovers.

The 35-year-old was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years for killing Ms Younis, 30, known to her friends as Jabeen.

Nazar had tried to call his wife 25 times, as he laid in wait for her to return to the couple's home in Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester on April 19 last year.

When Ms Younis - described in court as a 'very attractive and flirtatious woman' - arrived home, after meeting a married man for sex to 'celebrate his birthday', Nazar lashed out.

Threats: A month before he murdered his wife, Nazar threatened to kill Ms Younis after a row over her lifestyle

During the frenzied attack he stabbed his wife in the neck, while her six-year-old son from a previous marriage slept in his bedroom.

Her body was discovered under her duvet after her son rang 999 after failing to rouse his mother, whose body had been locked in the bedroom.

At Manchester Crown Court today Pakistan-born Nazar, an illegal immigrant, was found guilty of murder, following a two-week trial.

He was jailed for life, and told he will serve at least 22 years behind bars before he is eligible for release.

Ms Younis married Nazar in an Islamic ceremony in 2012, 
believing their marriage would allow him to stay in the UK.

He
 worked at a local Indian takeaway while she got a job at a furniture 
store and was said to have initially been ‘head over heels’ in love with
 her husband.

But prosecutor John Jones QC, said 
Nazar was a 'possessive, controlling and violent partner' who installed a
 tracking app device on his wife’s mobile phone to check her movements 
whenever she was out.

Mr 
Jones said: 'It’s clear that Jabeen and the defendant had entirely 
different attitudes to life - it’s clear from others who witnessed the 
couple that the defendant was very possessive and very controlling of 
Jabeen.

'She was far more 
Westernised, outgoing and one has to say, promiscuous in the conduct of 
her life, if what other witnesses say about her is correct.

'That is not said in a critical way, 
Jabeen was entitled to behave in a way she chose, this is not a court of
 morals or a judgement on her lifestyle.

Frenzied: Ms Younis, 30, was brutally attacked at the couple's home in Chadderton, near Oldham on April 19 last year

Unfaithful: Manchester Crown Court heard Nazar flew into an uncontrollable rage after his wife returned home from meeting a lover. He attacked the 30-year-old as her son, six, from a previous marriage slept upstairs

'But, the fact remains that Jabeen lived in every sense an entirely Westernised lifestyle.

'She went to nightclubs, she had many boyfriends, she drank alcohol and she wore Westernised designer clothing.

'It’s
 clear she was a very attractive and flirtatious woman. Nazar resented 
it and sought to control it, and on the night in question, it led to 
uncontrollable rage.

'The end result was a significant attack by a man fearful of deportation, jealous of other men, and resentful of the promiscuity of his girlfriend.'

The court heard Ms Younis had been having an affair with a local cab driver who was also married.

A month before the murder in April last year, Nazar had threatened to kill Ms Younis after a row over her lifestyle.

Carla Cutting, a friend of Ms Younis, told the jury: 'Jabeen was always talking about him and showing pictures of him.

'She was very proud of him and at first seemed head over heels - but their relationship was very stormy. She was talking about splitting up with him but then they would be back together.'

Life in prison: Nazar pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but a jury convicted him of Ms Younis's murder. Judge Ingrid Smiler jailed him for life, telling the takeaway delivery driver he would serve at least 22 years behind bars

'The last time I spoke to Jabeen was on Facebook two days before her death. She said she could not talk because ‘you know who’ was present.

'I can remember one occasion about a month before Jabeen’s death, when I was present when she was speaking to Nazar on her mobile phone.

'The phone was on loudspeaker so I could hear both sides of the conversation, I could hear them arguing - I heard him threaten to give her a slap and then say, "I will kill you".

'At the time I just thought this had been said in anger, in the heat of the moment, rather than a genuine threat.'

Speaking after the court case a 
statement released by Ms Younis's family, said: 'Fand had left the family home 
wanting to have more responsibility and manage her own home, at the time
 of her murder she was living in Oldham with her two children.

'She was a hard working, devoted mother. Everything she did was for her family and her children.

'Her
 husband, Jahangir Nazar has brutally murdered Fand in the most awful 
way stabbing her multiple times in the neck causing catastrophic 
un-survivable injuries.

'He has carried out this deliberate and unprovoked attack whilst her six-year-old son was asleep in the next room.

'We
 believe that the reason Fand was murdered was because she wanted to end
 the relationship due to the domestic violence she had been subjected 
to.

'She refused to assist Nazar in obtaining a permanent Visa as he was facing the possibility of deportation.

'We
 feel that we have been cheated from watching our beautiful daughter 
achieve all the things she wanted in life, she lived for her children 
and now she will never get to see them grow up and they will not know 
who their mother was or how important they were to her.'

Another friend, Abdul Majeed, told the court he saw Nazar ‘hit Jabeen in the face very hard’ when he believed she was lying to him about where she had been.

Mr Majeed told court that Ms Younis had told him she was going to leave Nazar and had ‘got police involved’.

Nazar admitted manslaughter but denied murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by a depressive mental illness.

But the court heard after the killing, he disposed of a blood-soaked sock down a drain, withdrew money from a cashpoint and filled up his car with petrol.

He was arrested by police at Newcastle train station four days after the killing, carrying a suitcase filled with clothes and £1,000 in cash and was thought to be in the process of fleeing the country.

Sentencing Judge Ingrid Smiler said: 'You wanted her to wear a head scarf and did not approve of her style or her new friends or the fact she went to nightclubs and the like.

'Within a short period of time your disapproval of her vivaciousness and zest for life manifested itself in violence which you inflicted by beating, punching and strangling her.

'In addition to this you became jealous, possessive and controlling and tried to prevent her seeing her family and friends.

'You put a tracking app on her phone and hacked into her Facebook account. On a number of occasions in the months leading up to this you threatened to kill her if you discovered she had been unfaithful to you.

'On April 18 you worked a 4pm to 1am shift as a delivery driver. You left early claiming you felt unwell but I am sure you went looking for Jabeen.

'You made unsuccessful calls to her phone. You drove repeatedly around roads near your home.

'You went home to wait for her and she returned with her six-year-old son at 1.30am.

'You waited for her to put him to bed and change out of her clothes and you must then or earlier have got one or more knives taken from the kitchen and gone upstairs where you engaged in a frenzied and ferocious knife attack inflicting 19 wounds - the majority into her neck.

'Such was the force and severity that part of the knife was broken into the neck.

'The knife severed her spinal cord. She can have been in no position to defend herself.

'There is a hole in the family’s lives that can’t be filled. Jabeen was, they say, the life of this large, close family. A part of them has died with her.'
