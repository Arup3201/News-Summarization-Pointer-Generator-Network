eBay is stepping up its efforts to make sure consumers are able to get their goods within the hour.

The California e-commerce giant has spent the past few months sending out local couriers to pick up and drop off packages from buyers and sellers - part of its new on-demand delivery service called eBay Now.

Customers in San Francisco and New York can use their computers, smartphones and tablets to order from select stores, including Toys ’R' Us, Target, Best Buy and Macy’s and Home Depot.

eBay says it is looking to expand to other cities.

The company’s 50 or so go-betweens, who call themselves ‘shoppers,’ will deliver a customer’s purchase to his or her doorstep in about 60 minutes.

Those who use the service pay a $5 delivery and local sales tax.

The layout of the site looks a lot like Pinterest, TechCrunch notes.

VentureBeat reviewed a beta version of the speedy delivery service in August and wrote that ‘placing the order was almost too easy.’

Wired Magazine recently spent an afternoon with Tuvshin Batsuren, 24, one of eBay Now’s go-betweens. Batsuren raced against traffic to pick up and drop off a pair of tan boots from Payless.

She made it.

eBay, which has about 100 million active users, isn't alone in making online shopping more immediate through same-day delivery.

Amazon.com offers a same-day shipping service in ten major U.S. cities. Its base rate is more expensive than eBay's.

Walmart has been offering a same-day delivery service through contracts with third parties, including United Parcel Service.
