Tim Sherwood took charge of his first Aston Villa training session on Tuesday.

The former Tottenham manager, 46 was officially unveiled at Villa Park 24 hours earlier after he signed a deal until 2018 to replace the sacked Paul Lambert.

Sherwood watched Villa beat Leicester 2-1 in the FA Cup on Sunday and went into the dressing room at half-time to deliver a team-talk with the score 0-0.

And with Villa in the bottom three of the Barclays Premier League, Sherwood appeared to adopt a similarly hands-on approach at Bodymoor Heath.

The club's American owner, Randy Lerner, was also present to watch the new man in action. 

Sherwood, who has the highest win percentage of any Tottenham manager in Premier League history after his five-month tenure at White Hart Lane, was seen ordering his new side about.

His side face Stoke City on Saturday in what is arguably a must-win encounter with Villa's future in the top flight in doubt.  The Villains have only 22 points from 25 fixtures and have scored a dismal 12 goals.

Sherwood's arrival at Villa has been met by the departure of first-team coach Scott Marshall. 

Marshall had been in caretaker charge following the sacking of Paul Lambert last week and oversaw Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup win over Leicester.

But, with Sherwood replacing Lambert, former Arsenal defender Marshall has now parted company with the Barclays Premier League strugglers.

Villa chief executive Tom Fox told the club's official website: 'I'd like to thank Scott for his efforts during his time at the football club and especially under difficult circumstances at the weekend when he took the team for Sunday's FA Cup victory over Leicester City.

'We wish him all the best in the future.'
