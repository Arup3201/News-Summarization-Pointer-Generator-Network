Leicester remain unbeaten in pre-season after a 1-1 draw against League One side Preston North End at Deepdale.

Liam Moore's expertly taken volley gave the Premier League side the lead, but Phil Brown's side levelled things up in the second half when Tom Clarke nodded home from close range.

After a cagey opening 25 minutes the game suddenly came to live when Moore gave the Foxes the lead from an excellent move.

Paul Konchesky's deep cross from the left found Gary Taylor-Fletcher who in turn teed up the young centre-half who finished with aplomb as his volley cannoned in off the post.

The League One side went close to getting themselves back into the game on 40 minutes with Moore again heavily involved as he made a crucial block from veteran striker Kevin Davies' shot.

Preston continued to apply pressure after the interval and eventually got a deserved equaliser on 57 minutes. Clarke rose highest in the area to level the scoreline, as they looked to preserve their four-match unbeaten run.

The Foxes were fortunate not to be 2-1 down just a minute later when Kasper Schmeichel came to the rescue to palm away John Welsh's effort.

Up the other end Chris Wood could have given the Premier League side the lead just after the 70 minute mark, after his header went narrowly wide of goal when David Nugent found him in the area.

Both sides looked to the bench as the game petered out towards the end, with the home side undoubtedly the more satisfied with the result. 

They face Notts County at home in the opening game of the new season, whereas the newly-promoted Foxes have another three friendlies before they entertain Everton in their first Premier League fixture of the season.
