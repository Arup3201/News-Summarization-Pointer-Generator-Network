David Cameron will be ‘degrading’ Parliament when he stuffs the House of Lords with yet more political party cronies this week, it has been claimed.

The Prime Minister is to hand out around 20 peerages nominated by the three main parties boosting numbers in the upper chamber to their highest since most hereditary peers were removed.

A string of Conservative supporters including The Apprentice star Karren Brady will become members of the House of Lords.

Multi-millionaire Tory donors former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose and former party treasurer Michael Farmer are also expected to get seats.

Last night, Mr Cameron was warned that the appointments could lead to fresh claims of ‘cash for peerages’.

 

Paul Flynn, a member of the Political and Constitutional Reform select committee, said: ‘It is a nonsense to add to the number of unelected people in Parliament.

‘Bringing in these party political appointments degrades Parliament, it is a backwards step.

‘It is still possible to buy a seat in the House of Lords. It is an outrage, but it is fact. It is denied that it is the case, but an extraordinary number of donors end up in the Lords. It is a corrupting force in our democracy.

‘How can Britain be a champion for democracy around the world while this goes on?’

Patrick O’Flynn, a Ukip MEP, said: ‘Yet more LibLabCon establishment cronies being put into the unreformed House of Lords.’

Senior peers have already warned that the House of Lords is ‘full’ and that the Prime Minister must stop creating new members.

They have argued that the House of Lords is overcrowded with members competing for seats in the chamber and the chance to speak in debates.

Mr Cameron’s latest appointments would increase the number of members who are entitled to attend and vote to 794 – the highest number since all but 92 of the hereditary peers were expelled.

Miss Brady is a prominent Conservative backer and last year introduced Chancellor George Osborne on to the stage at the party's annual conference.

The 44-year-old, who has appeared on BBC One’s The Apprentice alongside Labour peer Lord Sugar, had been offered at least half a dozen Tory safe seats in the run-up to next year’s election.

At the age of 20 she was made a director of Sport Newspapers by porn baron David Sullivan. She later became managing director of Birmingham City before being appointed vice-chairman at West Ham United in 2010 when Sullivan and David Gold bought the club.

Sir Stuart, who left M&S in 2010 and is currently chairman of grocery delivery firm Ocado, was appointed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt earlier this year as an adviser on recruiting top leaders to the NHS and has also spoken at the party’s annual conference.

Michael Farmer, a City financier who has donated more than £2.3million to the Tories since 2002, was appointed the party's co-treasurer by Mr Cameron in 2012.

Nick Clegg is expected to nominate about six people to be elevated to the Lords including Chris Fox, the former Liberal Democrat chief executive.

Ed Miliband is thought to have nominated former Eastenders actor Michael Cashman, who has been a member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands since 1999.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We won't be confirming anything in advance. Any appointments would be made in the usual way and are subject to independent vetting and scrutiny by the House of Lords Appointment Commission.’

The House of Lords Act 1999 reduced the number of working peers from 1,210 to 690, but it has been increasing in size and currently stands at 774 with a further 54 peers on leave of absence, disqualified or suspended. It is thought to be the second largest legislative house in the world and is more than twice the size of the upper houses in all other European Union and G20 countries.
