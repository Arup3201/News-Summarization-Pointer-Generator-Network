A British mother has been hacked to death during a violent robbery in Bangladesh.

Rehana Begum, 43, was on holiday when she was attacked by a gang of four men who targeted her for her jewellery and money, her family said.

The British national, from Stepney, east London, died in Sunamganj, Bangladesh, today, the Foreign Office has confirmed.

Tragic: British mother Rehana Begum, 43, was on holiday in Sunamgonj, in northern Bangladesh, when she was hacked to death by a gang of four men

Her nephew, who gave his name as 
Abdul, told the BBC she had been on holiday in the country with her 
husband and 12-year-old son since 17 July.

He said Mrs Begum had been 'hacked to death' for her valuables.

The nephew said: 'It happened this morning.

'She has been hacked to death by four people for jewellery and money.'

Foreign
Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national
Rehana Begum in Sunamgonj, Bangladesh, on 2 August.

'We are providing consular assistance to her family at this difficult time.'

According to the Foreign Office's website, 'armed robbery, pick pocketing, and purse snatching can occur'.

It warns against carrying large amounts of money with you or wearing jewellery in the street.

It adds: 'Thieves often work in pairs on motorcycles or motorised rickshaws known as ‘CNGs’.

'Passengers using rickshaws, or travelling alone in taxis are particularly vulnerable, especially at night. 

'Try to avoid using public transport if you are on your own. Cycle rickshaws are not safe.'

Up to 75,000 British nationals visit Bangladesh every year, and the Foreign Office notes that 'most visits are trouble free'.

However, visitors to Bangladesh are warned of a 'general threat from terrorism'.
