Former welterweight boxing champion Oscar Diaz has died at the age of 32 - seven years after his  career came to a brutal end when he suffered a debilitating brain injury during a televised fight.

Diaz, then 25, was rushed to hospital after collapsing before the 11th round of a USBA welterweight championship match against Delvin Rodriguez, which was nationally broadcast on ESPN-2 in 2008.

There, he fell into a two-month-long coma and was forced to undergo emergency surgery to reduce swelling on his brain. He spent seven months in hospital in total, before being released in 2009.

Diaz has suffered numerous medical complications in the years since his injury. He was reportedly living at a San Antonio, Texas, nursing home and could not walk unaided when he died Thursday.

The cause of his death was complications arising from pneumonia, the San Antonio Express-News reported. However, the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office is yet to officially release a cause.

Earlier this month, Diaz's brother, Fernando, said that he visited his sibling - who spoke 'a little bit, "yes" and "no"' and ate solid foods "sometimes" - at the nursing home as often as he could.

'It's hard sometimes with a family and a job,' he explained, adding: 'We need a miracle.'

According to the boxing news website Fight Saga, Diaz, who made his professional fight debut in 2001, ended his award-winning career with 26 wins and three losses to his name. 

Known as 'El Torito', he collapsed in the ring at San Antonio's former Municipal Auditorium (later transformed into the Tobin Center) during his fight against Rodriguez on July 16, 2008.

The former welterweight title holder is believed to have been regularly treated at the city's University Hospital over the past seven years. His funeral arrangements are pending.
