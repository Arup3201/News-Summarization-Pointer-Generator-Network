Officer Jesse Turano and his partner saved a 37-year-old man from jumping on Tuesday. This is the 12th person Turano has saved in five years

A veteran Port Authority police officer has saved 12 people from jumping to their deaths from New York City's George Washington Bridge in just five years - his most recent rescue coming just Tuesday. 

Officer Jesse Turano and his partner saved a 37-year-old man this week after they found an abandoned car on the side of the road and the man standing on the bridge's edge.

Nine-year veteran Turano and  Officer Brendan Mulderrig spotted the abandoned 2011 Toyota Venza after getting a call about a suicidal man at 6.40pm.

The officers couldn't immediately find the man, but heard him screaming into his phone while standing on the outside of the bridge's railing with the river 200 feet below, according to New York Post.

'What I did is tell him, "Relax! Relax! All I want to do is talk to you." And all he would say was, "Get Away! Get Away! All I want to do is die!"' Turano told New York Post.  

Turano, a weightlifter and former Marine, reached over and grabbed the man, struggling to pull him back to safety as Mulderrig held onto his partner, according to NJ.com. 

They succeeded after a few tense moments, and the man was taken to Englewood Hospital for an evaluation. 

'I wasn’t going to let him go - I wasn’t going to let him die while I was out there,' Turano told the Post.

Turano started working at the bridge in 2010, and since his start date he has prevented 12 suicides and has saved men and women of all ages.

During one rescue, he snatched a man out of the air by the belt in order to save him from jumping.

The span across the Hudson River is the most popular spot in the New York City area for suicide - with at least a dozen jumpers every years and about 40 foiled attempts, the Post reports.
