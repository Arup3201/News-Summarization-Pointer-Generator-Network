It's the eerie backdrop of one of Australia's most fabled sites.

Hanging Rock outside of Melbourne was made famous from Peter Weir's film Picnic At Hanging Rock where the disappearance of several school girls and their teacher shrouded the area in mystery.

Now the 1900s-based story has helped inspire architect Kerstin Thompson's award-winning House at Hanging Rock in the Mace­don Ranges. 

It was the eerie backdrop of Peter Weir's film Picnic At Hanging Rock, but now it's helped inspire architect Kerstin Thompson's award-winning House at Hanging Rock in central Victoria

House at Hanging Rock is divided into three parallel terraces each with sweeping bushland views

Her design picked up the major gong on Thursday night at the 2014 national Australian Institute of Architecture awards.

'I can't hear the name Hanging Rock or think about that place without remembering Peter Weir's film,' Ms Thompson told The Australian.

'The building has a certain enigma to it as well; it doesn't give away everything immediately.'

The house is nestled into the steep slope with a view of its namesake. It's surrounded by the iconic Australian bush and has been designed for a high Bushfire Attack Level rating.

The living and kitchen areas have varied floor heights that allow for informal seating and art display areas

Raw insulated precast concrete walls define the terraces and draw the eye through the house to the old growth forest to the east. 

Narrow timber shutters within the walls artfully allow for cross ventilation and views to the valley.
