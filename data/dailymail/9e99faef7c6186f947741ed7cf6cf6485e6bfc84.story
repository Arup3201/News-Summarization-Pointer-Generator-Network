As ubiquitous as Google and as inextricably part of the internet’s DNA, Amazon.com is a multibillion dollar company built on one man’s fear of regret. 

Twenty years ago, founder Jeff Bezos, then 30, cast his mind forward and asked himself what regrets he had in his life. He realized, he later recalled, ‘If I’d ignored the emergence of the Internet just as it was happening …I’d be a fool.’

This year Amazon.com celebrates its 20th anniversary just as Bezos celebrates his 50th. It is hard to believe that a man so driven would defer acting to get something he truly wanted. It's what makes his inaction on the matter of his biological father all the more pointed.

Bullish, driven and determined: Bezos founded Amazon.com in a bid to live life without regrets

It is three months since Ted Jorgensen, 69, owner of a small biker repair shop in Arizona, was publicly revealed as Bezos's estranged father.

But now, speaking to MailOnline, he has admitted that he has been forced to set aside the notion that Bezos would show some sign of welcoming the older man’s desire to reconnect with him.

Speaking from his home in Glendale Mr Jorgensen said: ‘I don’t think he will come to me now. I haven’t heard a word for him or had any sign that he wants to connect with me. I hoped with the publicity it might happen but I can’t blame him. I guess I wasn’t a very good father.’

Mr Jorgensen was revealed as Bezos’s biological father last October. He only learned the identity of the son he last saw when he was barely one
 year old when approached by a writer working on a biography of the 
billionaire.

Reporter Brad 
Stone, author of 'The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and Amazon,' tracked Mr Jorgensen down to a small bike repair shop in Glendale
 Arizona in 2012. He was stunned to discover that Mr Jorgensen had no idea 
who Bezos was or his intimate connection to him.

Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage 
unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned 
that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this 
year, at age 69)

Unlike his son who has mapped out his
 life according to what he calls ‘a regret minimalization framework,’ Mr
 Jorgensen revealed that he is riven with thoughts of what might have 
been.

Now in less than good
 health, he said that an awareness of his own mortality has made him 
feel the need to meet his son – his only biological child – more 
keenly. 

He said: ‘I’m 
anxious about it. I would like to connect with him. I’m not in great 
health. I don’t plan on dying just yet but it does make me think, it 
plays a part in wanting to see him.

‘I’m his biological father and I just want to shake his hand and tell him he’s done well and be recognised as his father.

Father of choice not birth: Miguel Bezos with Jeff's mother Jackie. He adopted Jeff at the age of four and is the only father the billionaire has ever known

‘I would want that no matter what he turned out to be.’

Bezos was recently listed number 15 in Forbes’s list of Most Powerful People, he ranks 12 in the Forbes 400 and his estimated worth is $27.5billion.

But Mr Jorgensen insisted: ‘I just want to see him as my son, just to have him acknowledge that I’m his father and he’s my son. 

‘Other than that I don’t want anything from him. I don’t want to push my way in or push the other dad out of the way. I’d just like to see him.’

Mr Jorgensen and Bezos’s mother Jackie were just teenagers when she fell pregnant in Alburquerque, New Mexico. Mr Jorgensen was 18 and a unicyclist  and rising star on the niche circuit.

He and Jackie were married for two years before she left, taking their infant son with her. According to Mr Joregensen: ‘I had a number but Jeff’s mother asked me not to interfere so I didn’t want to call.

‘I used to wonder all the time though whatever happened to Jeff. Then I just reached a point where I thought he was long gone. That was the only child I ever had – that makes a difference too. The last time I saw him he was in diapers.’

When her son was four, Bezos’s mother married Miguel Bezos who adopted Jeff as his own. Mr Jorgensen is now married to wife, Lisa, and is stepfather to her four adult sons.

All or nothing man: Bezos, pictured with wife Mackenzie, founded the 'everything store' but seems to want nothing to do with his biological father.

At first the couple decided not to tell them about the identity of their half-brother. But early last year they changed their minds.

Watching footage of their famous half-sibling the family were stunned to hear that Bezos shares the same distinctive, braying,  laugh as his biological father.

Mr Jorgensen said: ‘We have the same laugh it’s true and it was very strange to hear that. I wonder what other things we share in common.’

He added; ‘I regret that I wasn’t a better father. I wonder how things might have been different.'

And though the founder of the 'everything store' has given every impression of wanting nothing to do with the man to whom he owes his existence, Mr Jorgensen said he still held out hope.

He said: 'But I do still hope to meet him even once. I haven't made my big plunge yet but I plan to. I will.'

More than a year after learning who his son is and what he has become it is hard not to hear this vow as a hollow echo of the one made by MrJorgensen last October. And hard not to feel that unlike his son, Mr Jorgensen need not cast his mind very far forward to answer the question 'What regrets do I have in my life?'
