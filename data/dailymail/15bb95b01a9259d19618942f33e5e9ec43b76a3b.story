The United States has paid Pakistani television stations to run advertisements featuring President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, hoping to soothe public opinion in a country hit by protests against an anti-Islam movie made in California, the State Department said on Thursday.

The U.S. embassy in Islamabad spent about $70,000 to run the announcement, which features clips of Obama and Clinton underscoring U.S. respect for religion and declaring the U.S. government had nothing to do with the movie, it said.

The State Department says the embassy compiled clips of Obama and Clinton rejecting the contents of the movie and extolling American tolerance for all religions into a 30-second public service announcement that is running on seven Pakistani networks

Making the message clear: The minute-long video shows two clips from public statements made by President Obama (right) and secretary of state Hillary Clinton (left) condemning the Innocence of Muslims film

Audience: Running the clips with Urdu subtitles, the ad will be aired in Pakistan and will cost $70,000

'In order to ensure we reached the largest number of Pakistanis, some 90million as I understand it in this case with these spots, it was the judgment that this was the best way to do it,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told a news briefing.

The U.S. announcement aired as Washington warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Pakistan, one of the mostly Muslim countries hit by a wave of anti-American demonstrations.

In Libya, a deadly assault last week killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

The protests, which were sparked by an Internet video that mocked the Prophet Mohammad and swept through Yemen, Egypt and other countries, also prompted the U.S. government to withdraw non-essential personnel in Tunisia and Sudan.

In Pakistan, protesters have demonstrated in more than a dozen cities.

Counter-terrorism analysts for the New York Police Department warned in a paper circulated on Thursday that the anti-U.S. and anti-Western protests would continue to spread, fueled most recently by a French magazine's publication of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammad.

The cartoons in France's Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly have provoked relatively little street anger thus far, although about 100 Iranians demonstrated outside the French embassy in Tehran.

Nuland said the decision to buy the television ads, identified as paid public service announcements, was not unusual in countries where this is 'the norm for getting your message out.'

'I think the sense was that this particular aspect of the president and the secretary's message needed to be heard by more Pakistanis than had heard it, and that this was an effective way to get that message across,' she said.

She said it would take time to measure the effectiveness of the ads in Pakistan, where on Thursday and Friday, huge crowds again gathered to protest against the video.

In the video, Obama
 and Clinton's comments, which are from previous public events in 
Washington, are in English but subtitled in Urdu, the main Pakistani 
language.

Tens of thousands protested against the film around the country after the government encouraged peaceful protests and declared a national holiday - Love for the Prophet Day.

Demonstrations turned violent and three people were killed, including a driver for a Pakistani television station, who died after police opened fire on rioters torching a cinema in the northwest city of Peshawar during a protest.

Clashes between police and thousands of stone-throwing protesters also occurred in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.

Ms Nuland said the aim was to get the messages to the 
widest possible audience in Pakistan, where tens of thousands of 
protestors angry about the film tried to reach the U.S. embassy before 
being turned back by Pakistani police.

She said embassy staffers had decided
 the ads were the best way to spread the word. The seven networks have a
 potential audience of 90 million people, she added.

'The
 sense was that this particular aspect of the president and the 
secretary's message needed to be heard by more Pakistanis than had 
heard, and that this was an effective way to get that message out,' Ms 
Nuland told reporters in Washington.

The ads are not running in other countries, she said.

In
 the ad, Obama is seen talking about America's tradition of religious 
tolerance and Clinton is seen saying that the U.S. government had 
nothing to do with the video that contains vulgar depiction of the 
Prophet Muhammad.

'We absolutely reject its content and message,' Clinton says in the advertisement.

Nuland
 said it was common practice to pay to air public service announcements 
in Pakistan and noted that the embassy there had done it at least one 
other time, in the aftermath of a deadly 2005 earthquake that hit the 
country.

In an email sent 
after the ads began running Thursday, the embassy in Islamabad also 
distributed a link to video of ordinary Americans condemning the 
anti-Islam film, which appeared on YouTube.

Nuland
 said that some of the comments on the video had been solicited by the 
U.S. government from religious leaders and other prominent people in 
order to demonstrate that anti-Muslim sentiment is not widely shared in 
the United States.

In an 
interview with The Associated Press, Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina 
Rabbani Khar defended her government's decision to declare Friday a 
holiday to allow people to peacefully protest the video.

She
 said the so-called 'day of loving the prophet' would motivate the 
peaceful majority to demonstrate their love for Muhammad and not allow 
extremists to turn it into a show of anger against the United States.
