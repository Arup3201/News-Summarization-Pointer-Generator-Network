Ghana football captain and former Premier League player Asamoah Gyan has dismissed claims he killed a friend in a black magic human sacrifice ritual as 'wild and ludicrous allegations'. 

Ghanaian rapper Castro, whose real name is Theophilus Tagoe, disappeared, along with friend Janet Bandu, in July.

They went missing on a jet ski during a weekend trip that had been organised by Gyan in the coastal town of Ada, in Ghana.

Castro and Bandu were last seen heading towards the ocean together on a jet ski and were presumed drowned.

But allegations in the media began to suggest the disappearance was suspicious.

Rumours circulated that Gyan had either murdered Castro or had him kidnapped - and even suggested he sacrificed him spiritually to enhance his own career.  

No bodies were recovered and rumours continued  this month when Gyan's brother and fellow Ghana footballer, Baffour Gyan, was alleged to have been part of a gang which attacked a journalist who had asked the player about the rumours. 

The assault charges on Baffour Gyan, who plays for Al-Nasr Benghazi in Libya, have now been dropped.

The speculation prompted Gyan, who joined United Arab Emirates side Al-Ain from Premier League club Sunderland in 2011, to hold a press conference.

He explained he had not spoken earlier because he did not want to interfere with police investigations and also because of the assault charges levelled against his brother. 

In a statement, his lawyer Kissi Agyabeng read: 'In our painful silence, we have been totally dismayed by the fact that the platform was provided for the peddling of these wild and ludicrous allegations and rumours against us. 

'Those to whom the platform was provided offered no evidence whatsoever to back their statements. And indeed, the allegation of spiritual sacrifice can by no stretch of the imagination be propped up.

'The startling development has been the outbursts of persons who should know better. 

'Indeed, one such person has gone has far as to claim that he knows where Castro is being kept and that Asamoah Gyan also knows where Castro is being kept. He also made the unfortunate statement that we have bribed Castro's family to keep silent over the matter. Castro's father has publicly denied this. This is no way to treat grieving families and friends.'

He went on to say: 'Admittedly, the net effect of the peddling of these wild allegations and rumours is that the word on the street is that we had a hand in the disappearance of Castro and Janet Bandu. 

'This is how a person's reputation gets ruined and this is how disaffection gets sowed in the minds of persons against the person who is being attacked so unfairly.

'Perhaps we should have come out earlier. But I have already explained why we could not. 

'Now, we take the opportunity and state without the slightest doubt in our minds that we are not blamable for the disappearance of Castro and Janet Bandu. 

'We had no hand in that occurrence. We have no moral or legal culpability whatsoever.

'We do not know Janet Bandu that well. However, we do know that from the time we met her on July 4 2014 till her disappearance on July 6 2014, she proved herself to be a well mannered and graceful lady. We have no ill will against her.

'We know Castro all too well. He was our brother. We loved him as one of our own. We did everything together with him. 

'You are all witnesses to the hit songs Castro has been featuring Asamoah Gyan on and the added popularity that gave him. Indeed, the duo were just about to release another song. We will never do anything to harm him.'
