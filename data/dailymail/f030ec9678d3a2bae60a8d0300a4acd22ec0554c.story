Police in Hawaii arrested a man for drunk driving his pickup truck into the Pacific Ocean.

Norman Akana Jr., 38, was arrested on suspicion of driving a vehicle while intoxicated after he drove the truck into the ocean Saturday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.

Akana, of Lihue, was driving along Lydgate Beach behind a golf course in Kauai, Hawaii, when he turned straight into the surf.

Police said Akana was already out of his Ford pickup when police and firefighters arrived on scene, KHON2 reported. No one else was in the car at the time of the incident and he wasn't injured.

It took three tow companies to pull the submerged Ford F-150 from the water. And no wonderâ€”the 2013 model weighs over 6,000 pounds on its own, according to Motor Trend Magazine.

In addition to the DUI arrest, Akana was also arrested for refusal to submit to testing and reckless driving.

His bail was set for $4,000 and as of Sunday night Akana remained in police custody.

This isn't the first time someone has driven into the ocean.

A man drove his Cadillac Escalade into the ocean last summer from Monterey County beach in California, according to CBS. A crane was used to get the car out of the water.

In Long Island, Calif., another man drove his Nissan Maxima into the ocean in July 2012. Before heading for the water, the man drove around a parking lot, yelling his social security number and 'This is my beach!', according to the Press-Telegram.
