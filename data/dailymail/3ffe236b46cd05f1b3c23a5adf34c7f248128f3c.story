Britain’s biggest funeral firm has been accused of treating the dead with shocking disrespect and stacking bodies ‘like television sets’ at industrial-scale storage units.

Instead of being kept in a chapel of rest before burial or cremation, the dead are kept among ‘rack upon rack of bodies’ in a warehouse-style ‘hub’.

An undercover investigation revealed overworked staff were ‘treating bodies like luggage.’

Grim: Co-op Funeralcare were shown storing the bodies at a warehouse - the grieving families believed the deceased were at funeral homes

In one incident four bodies had to be transported in the same van and the lid was taken off an elderly woman’s coffin so they could all fit.

The woman’s nose was almost touching the shelf above and when the body was unloaded in view of a block of flats a member of staff held the lid over the coffin to ‘preserve some dignity’.

Co-operative Funeralcare, which has 900 funeral homes across the country and last year made a profit of over £52million, has apologised for bad practices revealed in Channel 4’s Dispatches programme and has launched an internal inquiry.

An investigator for the show worked in one of the hubs, which each serve several funeral homes.

The investigator saw bodies, some of which were uncovered, being slid in and out of racks just centimetres apart in a refrigerated mortuary.

Conditions were described as ‘chaotic’ and staff were accused of breaking the industry code of practice, which requires funeral directors to act in a ‘courteous, sensitive, dignified and professional manner’.

Commenting on the storage arrangements, former funeral ombudsman Professor Geoffrey Woodroffe said: ‘I had no idea – they’re treating people as if they’re stacking television sets really.

‘I’d hate to think that a member of my family would have been treated in that way. I find it shocking.’

He also criticised the lidless coffin incident, adding: ‘That isn’t dignified, it isn’t sensitive.’

George Tinning, managing director of Co-operative Funeralcare, admitted the woman’s body should not have been transported without a coffin lid. ‘It’s not right. I’m very sorry about that,’ he said.

But he defended the company’s hubs for storing bodies, commenting: ‘I don’t believe it’s industrial, I believe the premises are fitted out to a high standard.

‘I think the key here is the care that we take with the deceased when they are in our premises.’

There was also criticism of sales methods at a branch in Hayes, West London, where trainees were told not to offer the basic £2,010 package to customers. The area manager said: ‘The bottom line is we’re a business and we need to make money.’

Professor Woodroffe said there was a ‘clear breach of the code’ as customers were not being made aware of the full range of services.

Mr Tinning apologised for high-pressure selling and promised to address it.

‘I’m very proud of the operation  I run, but equally I’m shocked  and disappointed by the things  that you’ve uncovered,’ he told Dispatches.

A Co-operative Funeralcare spokesman said no one at the firm had seen the programme, adding: ‘We have a long-established reputation for delivering highly professional services.

‘We are, however, shocked and disappointed by the information provided to us by this programme, which goes against everything we stand for.

‘We do not believe that the instances shown in the programme are representative of our many caring staff.

‘We have, however, launched an immediate investigation into the programme’s findings and will take any action necessary to ensure our high standards and our policy of enabling clients to make informed choices is maintained.’

The firm was criticised three years ago when the wrong body was brought to Teesside Crematorium, followed 30 minutes later by the correct body in a van.

Recalling the funeral of her mother Olwyn, Mandy Rowden said: ‘It was awful. Terrible. I couldn’t cry because I was so angry.’

Co-operative Funeralcare later apologised, waived costs, paid compensation and disciplined staff.

The Dispatches investigation, Undercover Undertaker, is screened on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm.

Allegations: Dispatches suggests the firm could be in breach of industry codes when staff deliberately tried to sell mourners more expensive funerals than required
