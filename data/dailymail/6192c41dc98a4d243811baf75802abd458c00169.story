The good vibrations didn’t last long after the Beach Boys’ acclaimed 50th  anniversary tour ended in London last month.

In an extraordinary row, Brian Wilson, the songwriting genius behind many of the group’s biggest hits, claimed yesterday that he and two other founding members had been sacked.

The 70-year-old music legend was responding to claims by the group’s lead singer Mike Love that he planned to keep touring with the Beach Boys – but without Wilson, Al Jardine and David Marks.

Writing in the Los Angeles Times 
after Love made the announcement, Wilson said: ‘As far as I know I can’t
be fired – that wouldn’t be cool.’

He insisted he had been ‘blindsided’ 
by Love’s intention to go back on the road with a streamlined version of
the Californian band. ‘The negativity surrounding all the comments 
bummed me out,’ he said.

‘What’s confusing is that by Mike not 
wanting or letting Al, David and me tour with the band, it sort of feels
like we’re being fired.’

The creative force behind the Beach 
Boys said their 75-date comeback tour that ended at London’s Wembley 
Arena on September 28 exceeded his expectations, adding: ‘Mike kept 
saying throughout the tour, “The whole is greater than the sum of its 
parts”, and both Al and I agree, which made us all think that he wanted 
to continue.

Reuniting: The surviving founding members of the Beach Boys - Dennis Wilson, David Marks, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Brian Wilson - are celebrating their 50th anniversary with a 50-date tour and new album

Iconic: The group formed in 1961, and produced hits like I Get Around and Good Vibrations

‘We originally started out with 50 
shows, but the success and the demand kept growing and we obliged. No 
one knew in the beginning that this was going to be so rewarding and 
popular with our fans. Once we got cooking we were all stoked!’

The anniversary tour included original
members Wilson, Love, Jardine and Marks, who played guitar on the 
band’s 1962 debut album Surfin’ Safari.

Wilson said it was so successful, they were asked to do even more shows in Britain.

Speaking of Love, he said: ‘I do and 
always will love him as my cousin and bandmate. At the same time I’m 
left wondering why he doesn’t want to continue this great trip we’re on.

‘Al and I want to keep going because we believe we owe it to the music.’

The feud is the latest of many between Wilson and Love.

The Beach Boys, who sold 100million 
albums after helping to define the California sound of the early 
Sixties, were Wilson and his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Love
and Wilson’s friend Al Jardine. Marks covered for Jardine when he left 
to attend college.

Dennis drowned in a diving accident in 1983 and Carl died from lung cancer in 1998.

At war: Love wrote in an article that the 50th anniversary tour was always finite and that the new dates in smaller venues had long been set for the line-up toured by him

Love, who controls the rights to the 
band’s name and has led a version of the Beach Boys on the road for the 
past 13 years, said Wilson had stopped touring regularly in 1964.

He denied firing Wilson, saying the 
50th anniversary tour that brought the surviving founder members back 
together was always meant to be a one-off, after which he and his 
touring band would continue playing smaller venues.

He added: ‘I was surprised that Brian and Al said they were surprised by this announcement.’
