Alex Salmond has taken to drinking 'pink champagne' in the afternoon, it has been revealed

A Labour government propped up by the SNP has been voted the worst possible outcome at the general election - but Alex Salmond has insisted he will support Ed Miliband's bid for power come what may.

Six out of 10 voters said they would be 'dismayed' by a Labour-SNP alliance. This compares with 54 per cent who said they did not want a Labour-Lib Dem coalition and 52 per cent dreading another pact between David Cameron and Nick Clegg, according to the pollsters YouGov.

Despite the unpopularity of an SNP-Labour alliance, Mr Salmond - who has taken to drinking pink champagne in the afternoon - has revealed that the party will do whatever it can to make Mr Miliband Prime Minister in order to wring as many concessions out of him as possible.

The revelation comes after David Cameron said Mr Miliband had given up trying to win the election outright and was pinning all his hopes on the SNP helping him over the line.

The PM said Mr Salmond had taken the entire Labour Party hostage and was using Mr Miliband as his poodle. 

The attack, at Prime Minister's Questions, comes amid dire polls for Labour pointing to a landslide election victory for the SNP.

Mr Salmond had earlier told the Spectator magazine that the SNP will use its power in Parliament after the election to block any attempt by the Tories to form a minority government - even if it had failed to strike a deal with Labour.

The revelation makes the prospect of a Tory minority government less likely - while increasing the prospect of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister. 

The SNP has already promised to work with Labour in return for sweeping spending increases and the end of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons.

Labour has ruled out a formal Labour-SNP coalition but not the prospect of working on a vote-by-vote basis if it fails to win enough seats to govern alone.

Speaking in the final Prime Minister's Questions session of the Parliament, Mr Cameron said the SNP had 'taken the entire Labour Party hostage'.

To cheers from the Tory benches Mr Cameron added: 'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence.

'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation - and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.'

Mr Cameron's attack comes amid growing alarm at the prospect of chaotic coalition negotiations in the result of hung Parliament after the general election in May.

According to today's YouGov poll, published in the Times, more people fear Coalition government than either the Tories or Labour winning outright in May.

Just under half the public think a Labour majority government is the worst possible outcome - compared to 45 per cent who said a Tory majority was the worst result.

A quarter said they would be 'delighted' or would not mind a Labour-SNP alliance, compared with a third broadly positive about Lab-Lib coalition, 37 per cent positive about another Tory-Lib pact, 41 per cent backing a Labour majority and 46 per cent a Tory majority.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to 'lock the Tories out of government', with her predecessor Alex Salmond yesterday confirming the SNP would side with Labour to vote down a minority Tory government's Queen's speech.

Today's YouGov poll of 8,271 UK voters, including 633 in Scotland, suggests the SNP could be on course to take about half of former Liberal Democrat and Labour voters in Scotland, and even a fifth of former Conservative voters.

The Tories have released a campaign video showing Alex Salmond 'calling Ed Miliband's tune' 

Half of 2010 Lib Dem voters said they will definitely or may possibly vote SNP in May while 44 per cent of former Labour voters and 20 per cent of former Conservative voters said the same.

Excerpts of a Scottish breakdown of the poll, published in The Times, found more than two-thirds of people in Scotland think Labour 'has seriously lost touch with ordinary working people'.

Three out of four people in Scotland said Labour needs to change its policies to become fit for government again while more than half think the party has not yet faced up to 'the damage it wrought on the economy'.

Nearly half (45 per cent) said the Labour Party in Scotland used to care about people like them but now does not, compared with 26 per cent who said they still do.

About one in ten (11 per cent) said Labour have never cared about people like them and just 3 per cent said they now care about them after previously dismissing them in the past.

A total of 69 per cent said Labour 'has seriously lost touch with ordinary working people'.

Almost a third (29 per cent) of people in Scotland said they would be 'delighted' with the SNP supporting a minority Labour government.

Two-thirds of people in Scotland would be dismayed by another Tory-Lib coalition while 52 per cent would not like a Lab-Lib Democrat coalition.

About half (51 per cent) said the SNP cared about them but 31 per cent said the SNP does not represent their interests.

YouGov surveyed 8,271 voters across the UK, including 633 in Scotland, between March 18 and 23.
