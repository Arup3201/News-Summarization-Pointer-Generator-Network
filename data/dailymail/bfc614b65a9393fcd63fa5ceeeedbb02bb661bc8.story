An Australian man who was critically injured in road accident in Bail has arrived in a Melbourne hospital to receive further treatment.

Nicho White, 43, is in a serious but stable condition at The Alfred Hospital.

Mr White did not have medical insurance and his family had to come up with more than $100,000 so he could be transferred to the hospital.

Thanks to support of high profile friends such as Olympic swimmer Michael Klim who also lives in Bali, and Melbourne-based musicians The Cat Empire, a fundraiser on youcaring.com raised the much needed money.

White's collision on his motorbike with a 4WD driven by a local man left him in an induced coma with serious head and internal injuries last Friday.

Nico White, 43, has spent the last six days in an induced come on life support in Bali, but is not on his way back home to Melbourne

Police have confirmed they won't press charges over the accident, and have denied claims the incident was a hit-and-run.

Head of Badung Police Komang Suartana said the other driver was overtaking a motorbike when he hit Mr White, but he was released after questioning.

'The incident was a pure accident,' he said.

'[The driver] didn't run away and stayed at the scene and was ready to take responsibility.'

Stepfather Ian McGill said the support had been a comfort in an anxious time for the family who relocated to Bali two years ago.

'It has been overwhelming, the number of good wishes we've received,' he told AAP.

Mr White was hit by a car while riding his motorbike early on Friday morning

But for Mr White, who has failed to wake from his induced coma, the flight itself, which left on Thursday morning is the first of many hurdles.

The plane carrying life support equipment and a medical team flew at low altitude and speed in order for him to survive.

On Tuesday, Swimmer Michael Klim started the push for fans to help bring his 'dear friend' Nicho White home to Australia from Bali, after he suffered the 'worst possible' brain injury in a motorbike crash.

'Our dear friend Nicho White who lives in Bali was in a serious accident and is fighting for his life in intensive care and needs your help to get him back home for treatment ASAP,' Klim wrote on his Facebook page.

'Head to Save Nicho White Appeal and donate now, please I’m begging you,' the Olympian medalist added.

Klim also lives in Bali with his wife Lindy, a Balinese princess.

Mr White's intensive care in a Denpasar hospital after his accident was costing his Melbourne family up to $6000 a day.

The once-fit surfer is suffering from serious head, chest and leg injuries and doctors have advised it was be best to medically evacuate him to Australia, at a cost of about $100,000.

Celebrities including high profile fashion designers such as Alice McCall and Nicholas Morley had previously contributed to the fundraising page.

Ms McCall wrote: 'Dear White Mcgills, you are like family to me, I hope this donation can help with Nicho’s fight to service. He is a strong sweet kind funny talented human being who is meant to be here with us on earth for years to come. Nicho there is so much love for you, shine on .Alice xxxx'.

Stepfather Ian McGill said attempts to bring Mr White out of the coma have so far been unsuccessful.

'In the scheme if seriousness, I think the doctor said it's the worst he's seen in terms of possible brain injury,' Mr McGill told AAP on Tuesday. 

The accident happened in the beachside town of Kerobokan in Bali

'We really don't know what the outcome will be.'

The fundraising page on the website youcaring.com has now raised more than $107,000 - slowly climbing to its goal of $250,000, which family say will contribute to the cost of rehabilitation.

The fundraiser was set up by his stepfather Ian McGill, and his mother Lyn McGill.

Ms McGill has been proving updates on Nicho's condition on the page, and recently wrote about the extent of her son's injuries, and that she would be travelling to Melbourne with him.

'He is actually a multi trauma patient because of other complications - eg. seriously broken leg, liver damage, threat of pneumonia...However our priority at this stage is to stabilise his brain injuries and get him breathing without the assistance of machines.'

So far, attempts to bring the 43-year-old out of the coma have been unsuccessful

Mr McGill said support has come from Melbourne, where he and his wife lived until two years ago, and Bali, a second home for years before that.

In Bali, Mr White designs jewellery and his sister Jessie is the founder of fashion label Shakuhachi, with stores in Bali and Australia.

There were initial reports the accident was a hit-and-run.
