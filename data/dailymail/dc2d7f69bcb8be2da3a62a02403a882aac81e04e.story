U.S. warplanes wiped out Islamic State insurgents menacing Iraq's Haditha Dam with five air strikes that widened what Barack Obama called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement.

Obama has branded Islamic State an acute threat to the West as well as the Middle East and said that key NATO allies stood ready to back Washington in action against the well-armed sectarian force.

The leader of a pro-Iraqi government paramilitary force in western Iraq said the air strikes destroyed an Islamic State patrol trying to attack the dam - Iraq's second biggest hydroelectric facility that also provides millions with water.

'They (the air strikes) were very accurate. There was no collateral damage... If Islamic State had gained control of the dam, many areas of Iraq would have been seriously threatened, even (the capital) Baghdad,' Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha told Reuters.

The aerial assault drove Islamic State fighters away from the dam, according to a police intelligence officer in the vast western province of Anbar, a hotbed of Islamist insurgency.

The U.S. military said in a statement that the strikes destroyed four IS Humvees, four IS armed vehicles, two of which were carrying anti-aircraft artillery, an IS fighting position, one IS command post and an IS defensive fighting position.

All aircraft left the strike areas safely, the Pentagon said.

The strikes were Washington's first reported offensive into Anbar since it started attacks on Islamic State forces in the north of Iraq in August.

Almost three years after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq and 11 years after their invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the war on Islamic State is drawing Washington back into the middle of Iraq's power struggles and bloody sectarian strife.

The head of the Arab League has urged its members to confront Islamic State extremists 'militarily and politically'.

The apparent call to arms came as President Barack Obama prepares to go to politicians and the American public with his own plan to stop the militants.

Backing from the 22-country Arab League could provide crucial support across the Middle East for Mr Obama's effort to assemble an international coalition against IS, which has conquered large parts of Iraq and Syria.

Nato forces have already agreed to take on the extremists.

Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said what is needed from Arab countries is a 'clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation' with 'cancerous and terrorist' groups.

The Arab League includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel 
said the strikes on the Sunni Muslim insurgents had been carried out at 
the request of the Shi'ite Muslim-led central government in Baghdad.

'If
 that dam would fall into (Islamic State's) hands or if that dam would 
be destroyed, the damage that would cause would be very significant and 
it would put a significant, additional and big risk into the mix in 
Iraq,' Hagel told reporters during a trip to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.

Obama said on the weekend he would explain to Americans this week his plan to 'start going on some offense' against Islamic State.

'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in an NBC TV interview.

'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control. And ultimately we're going to defeat 'em.'

The six-month-old battle for control of the Haditha Dam has been a rare case of co-operation between local Sunni tribes and the Shi'ite-led Iraqi military.

The Juhayfa tribe in Haditha has a long-standing fight with the Islamic State, which split with its parent organization Al Qaeda last year.

Anbar is complicated terrain for the 
Americans as they seek to root out Islamic State, since Sunnis fighting 
on behalf of the Baghdad government are the exception to the rule.

Islamic State fighters appear to be using captured U.S. military-issue arms and weapons supplied to moderate rebels in Syria by Saudi Arabia, according to a report published today.

The study by the London-based small-arms research organisation Conflict Armament Research documented weapons seized by Kurdish forces from militants in Iraq and Syria over a 10-day period in July.

The report said the jihadists disposed of 'significant quantities' of U.S.-made small arms including M16 assault rifles and included photos showing the markings 'Property of US Govt'.

It also found that anti-tank rockets used by IS in Syria were 'identical to M79 rockets transferred by Saudi Arabia to forces operating under the Free Syrian Army umbrella in 2013'.

The rockets were made in the then Yugoslavia in the 1980s.

Islamic State is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from Syrian military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied by the United States to the Iraqi army after it swept through northern Iraq in recent weeks.

The
 large desert province, bordering Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, has 
been at war with Baghdad since last December when then-Prime Minister 
Nuri al-Maliki sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators' 
camp.

That sparked a tribal revolt against Maliki whom Sunnis accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests.

Islamic State fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among Sunnis.

The fighting there, which has displaced 430,000 people since January, strengthened Islamic State ahead of its lightning blitz this summer across the north of Iraq, also threatening the semi-autonomous, Western-backed enclave of Kurdistan.

Thriving on Maliki's sectarian-motivated alienation of Sunnis, Islamic State committed wide-scale atrocities against Shi'ites, Christians and other non-Sunnis this summer as the Iraqi army imploded in the face of the insurgents' advance.

Since June, Islamic State has massacred hundreds of soldiers outside of Saddam's hometown, Tikrit, after capturing it, and killed a similar number of Yazidis and other religious minorities outside of Mosul, the north's biggest city.

Obama ordered air strikes in northern Iraq last month as Kurdish-controlled territory fell to the Islamic State and the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan looked in endangered.

Last weekend, U.S. warplanes carried out raids farther south in the province of Saluhuddin to break an Islamic State siege of the Shi'ite Turkmen town of Amerli.
