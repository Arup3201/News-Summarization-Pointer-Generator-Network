Berkeley, Missouri is preparing for a third night of protests after the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white police officer on Tuesday.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, crowds swarmed the gas station where 18-year-old Antonio Martin was shot dead to protest the killing. The demonstrations became violent and led to several arrests.

Hours after Martin's death, authorities released surveillance footage from the gas station that they said showed the teenager raise a gun at a police officer, who was in the area responding to a robbery call. The officer, who has not been named, shot him dead.

On Twitter on Christmas Day, there continued to be calls for protests in the St Louis suburb, which is just three miles from where Michael Brown was shot by a white cop in Ferguson in August.

On Christmas Eve, the night started calmly, with fewer than 100 people, including Martin's grieving mother Toni Martin, turning out for a candle light vigil for the teen at the gas station.

They then marched through town and onto Interstate 170, forcing police to block off traffic and shut down the major St. Louis-area thoroughfare. 

Violent history: Police say Antonio Martin raised a gun at the officer before the officer shot him dead

Some of the protesters turned violent as the night wore on. Several nearby storefronts were damaged during what appeared to be the start of a small riot. 

At least one store, a local beauty salon, was broken into - though police chased away looters before they could make it inside. Gunshots could be heard in the parking lot, according to videos posted on social media. 

Six to eight people were arrested, Berkeley Police Chief Frank McCall said, and more than 40 officers were on hand to restore order.

Also on Wednesday night, a mass shooting outside a 7-Eleven in downtown St. Louis left one person dead and three people critically injured. The incident appears to be unrelated to Wednesday's protests.  

The protests were not nearly as violent or as large as on Tuesday night - when more than 300 furious people converged on the Mobil station within hours of the shooting. The protests turned violent when someone set off an explosive next to a gas pump. Another protester lit firecrackers.

Several angry members of the mob lobbed rocks and bricks at officers.

Four people were arrested and at least two officers were injured - including one who was caught in the bomb blast.  

Police say that Martin pulled a loaded handgun on the officer without warning while the cop was talking to him and a friend in the parking lot of the Mobil on Tuesday night.

By the end of the night on Wednesday, the protests turned violent. At least one store was broken into, several others were damaged and police made several arrests. No shops were actually looted, however

The officer stumbled backward, dropped his flashlight and fired as he fell to the ground. On Wednesday, they released surveillance footage showing the police officer running.

One of the shots hit Martin and killed him. One went into the tire of the officer's squad car. The third bullet has not been found.

Martin did not open fire on the officer after pulling the gun, police say, but Mayor Theodore Hoskins said he believed the officer's actions potentially saved his life.

Police are still looking for the second suspect from the evening - who can been seen in surveillance video sprinting away at full speed when the shooting starts.   

Despite the three videos and the photos of the gun, Martin's family and many supporters don't believe the version of events that police are offering.

Martin's grandmother, Margret Chandler, 65, told the Los Angeles Times: 'If he was in the wrong, I want to know he was in the wrong. I want to see the gun in his hand.

Fleeing for his life: The officer is seen in newly released surveillance camera footage falling to the ground after Antonio Martin pulled a gun on him, according to police. He then runs to the other side of the gas station

Police say that as the officer fell, he fired three shots - one of which hit Martin and killed him. Martin, who is off screen, had pulled a loaded pistol on the officer without warning, police say

'I don't want them to tell me he had it. I want to see it. These police do some dirty things. They just wait until nightfall to see some young black men and gun them down.'

The shooting two days before Christmas comes at a time when tensions between the black community and police are at their highest in recent memory. The decision by the grand jury in St. Louis not to indict the officer in Mike Brown's death - along with other failures to indict in high-profile cases - sparked mass protests and fury over alleged police brutality across the country. 

The anger at police took a horrific turn on Saturday when two New York officers were executed in their squad car by a man who said he was targeting cops as revenge for the deaths of Brown and New York chokehold victim Eric Garner. 

The death of Martin, a young black man, at the hands of a white police officer sparked immediate comparisons to Ferguson and other cases where police have been accused of using excessive force. 

A memorial of flowers and stuffed animals has cropped up near the spot where Martin was killed. One mourner posted a sign that said, 'They can't kill us all.'

But speaking about the death on Wednesday morning, Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said that the incident should not draw comparisons with the death of Brown, who was unarmed and whose death was not caught on camera.

Mayor Hoskins, who himself is black, added that Berkeley has a predominantly African American police force so his officers are more sensitive to race relations than officers in Ferguson.

He said that after hearing that a black teenager had been shot by a white officer last night, his first reaction was that it was another case of police brutality. But after finding out what happened, 'I can assure you that did not happen last night', he said.

'Everybody don't die the same,' he said. 'Some people die because police initiate it. Some people die because they initiate it. At this point, our review indicated that the police did not initiate this.'

The officer who shot Martin is on administrative leave. The 34-year-old officer, a six-year veteran of the force, did not have his body camera switched on.
