A group of buskers have drowned out an anti-gay preacher during Mardi Gras by singing Girls Just Wanna Have Fun in front of a cheering crowd.

The preacher stood  on a step ladder with his Bible in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall on Saturday afternoon ahead of the city's Mardi Gras parade.

Axel Winter, 24, was scheduled to start busking just as the preacher launched a tirade of abuse towards gay men and women over a microphone.

'Before I could look up, people were surrounding him and few of them were happy,' the musician told Daily Mail Australia.

According to Mr Winter, the hateful messages quickly became aggressive and soon started to cause a lot of tension in the crowd.

'It was Mardi Gras - not only a day to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights, but also equality and unity towards all people,' he said.

Mr Winter and several other buskers - Jarne, Joe, Mex and Ollie - grabbed their equipment and set up their loudspeakers right behind the preacher in a bid to drown him out.

'We turned on the speaker and told the crowd that feeding this guy's hatred just shows him what he wants to see. 

'Then we sang songs about love and equality and the crowd began to ignore the man.'

The crowd cheered and sang along with the buskers eventually forcing the preacher to leave.

'The world is becoming equal... I'm so proud of this city for what it did. That man was entitled to freedom of speech, but hateful words and singling out certain people is not okay,' Axel said. 

The singer, who regularly busks in Pitt Street Mall, said he grew up in foster care surrounded by Christian families.

'My whole life until I was 11, I was told that homosexuals are "the devil's work" and it's a "sin". But I evaluated it for myself and found that they're human - they're made to be the way they are, and that's absolutely okay,' he said.

'Whether you're gay, transgender or even just confused, you're still my friend.'
