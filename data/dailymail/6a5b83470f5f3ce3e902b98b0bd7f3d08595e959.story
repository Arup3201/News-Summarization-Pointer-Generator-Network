Roberto Martinez insist he has no concerns about Ross Barkley’s form as he predicted the Everton midfielder will play a crucial role in the second half of the campaign.

Barkley has only scored one goal in his last 23 games for club and country and his play in recent weeks has lacked the vibrancy that became the norm during last season, when he cemented his place as a regular.

It has been difficult campaign for Barkley, as he suffered a knee ligament problem in August that ruled him out for seven weeks and his manager says he is only just getting back to full fitness.

The Everton boss believes the young English talent will play a big part in the second half of the season

He said: 'He is a goalscorer. He has an instinct to score goals and be dangerous in the final third. He is now fully fit. In the last two games he has played a really big part. He is slowly getting to his best level. 

'I am really looking forward to the second half of the season. He is in constant development and a constant learning process. He is a phenomenal talent but the most impressive aspect of him is his character and his willingness to learn.'

Having had just one win in five games, the Toffees manager was puzzled by his teams form. 

'Stats are confusing. I could say we have only lost one in 10. This season has been intense. It has been very good in that we have been tested and pushed. 

'We probably haven’t got the points that we deserved but the first half of the season was about pushing ourselves. The margins have to be very small.'

Martinez marveled at the form of Sergio Aguero this season and believes Man City are playing with swagger 

Romelu Lukaku has lead the line for Martinez this season, and the Spaniard is impressed with what the his Belgian striker has brought to the team this season.

'When he got back from the World Cup, what impressed me most was that he wanted to get back and help the team. The way he committed himself was very impressive.'

Martinez's side are the visitors to the Etihad in the late kick-off on Saturday and the Everton boss has been one of the many fans of City's prolific striker Sergio Aguero.  

'He is phenomenal. He is one of those players who can win a game on his own. Every season you get a player who can do that and Aguero is in that moment. 

'The win against Bayern Munich has changed the atmosphere. They are playing with a real swagger. It will be difficult but we didn’t get what we deserved at Tottenham and Hull and we will go there and try to get something.'

The Toffee's boss believes English football is making steps forward after the FA's England DNA Programme was unveiled on Thursday. 

'I think it is very positive. It starts a really good debate. Every country has a bit of a path, thinking along the same lines. You have seen it from Belgium, Holland, Spain, those long-term plans help countries develop a way of playing. 

'You should not be afraid to look around. Football is an expression of your culture. It is important to have a way of playing rather than trying to fit influential players into the team same team.'
