Alex Leaver, 39, was initially convicted of assaulting Jilly Sandamas, 49, but had his conviction overturned on appeal

It is a universal truth that, where there is a neighbours’ dispute, there’s quite often a leylandii not far away.

And the row between Jill Sandamas and 
Alex Leaver was no exception – although it also involved a stepladder, a
drenching with a hosepipe and two trips to court.

The saga began when Mrs Sandamas, 49, 
climbed up her stepladder to trim the leylandii branches which overhang 
her garden from Mr Leaver’s side of the fence.

With her electric hedge cutters in 
hand, she was suddenly hit by a huge jet of water when 39-year-old 
plumber Mr Leaver turned on his hosepipe.

The jet hit Mrs Sandamas full in the 
face, knocking her off the ladder.

She fell five feet into a flower bed,
hurting her knee, and was so upset she ran to another neighbour’s house
and asked her to call the police.

Mr Leaver was charged with the offence of common assault, which has a maximum sentence of up to six months in jail.

In January he was convicted of 
battery, fined £300 and ordered to pay Mrs Sandamas £100 compensation 
plus £790 in costs. But the story was not over yet.

He then appealed the
conviction, saying it was an accident and he had not intended to hit 
Mrs Sandamas.

Now his conviction has been overturned
by an appeal judge at Burnley Crown Court, who believed his version of 
events.

Mrs Sandamas lives in a £250,000 four-bedroom house in the 
village of Barnoldswick, Lancashire, with her husband Mark, the managing
director of an events and exhibition firm.

Sarah Statham, prosecuting, told the 
court that the couple’s house backed on to Mr Leaver’s £190,000 dormer 
bungalow, and they share a border made up of his leylandii hedge and 
their wooden fence.

Miss Statham said the couple’s garden 
fence was ‘somewhat lower’ than the hedge and the leylandii ‘protruded 
significantly’ over it.

On the day of the incident, neighbours
Keith and Vivienne Hardwick heard Mrs Sandamas using the trimmers from 
inside their house next door, the court was told.

Mrs Hardwick, 68, saw Mr Leaver using a
hosepipe and said he appeared to be trying to get water over the hedge 
deliberately. Her husband, 70, claimed he saw Mr Leaver squeezing the 
end of the pipe, as if trying to get more pressure, before aiming for 
the ladder.

But Mr Leaver denied any deliberate assault on his neighbour, and told officers he could not hear her using the hedge trimmers.

Mr Leaver, whose house is pictured, said he did not realise it was better to water a hedge's roots than its top

Yesterday Mrs Sandamas said she did 
not want to talk about the case, and instead wanted to consult with 
police and Victim Support.

But Mr Leaver claimed the incident had
occurred against a background of ill feeling between the two neighbours
which began when he built a conservatory.

Mr Leaver said: ‘It was all rather silly and it’s very unfortunate the matter got as far as it did at a crown court.

‘I’ve always wanted to be a good 
neighbour. I’ve never had any complaints before and get on well with my 
other neighbours – but things simply haven’t worked out between myself 
and Mrs Sandamas.

‘It has just been a nonsense and a 
complete farce. Now I’m going to have to be very careful if I want to 
water my hedge and will have to get my girlfriend to video me doing it 
in future.’
