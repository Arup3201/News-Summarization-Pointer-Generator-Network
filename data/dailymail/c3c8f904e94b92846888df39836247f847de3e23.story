Barcelona are set to hand Lionel Messi a new role behind a front two of Luis Suarez and Neymar, according to reports in Spain.

Manager Luis Enrique is in the enviable position of having three of the world's best forwards at his disposal ahead of the new season.

And he believes switching Messi from his position on the right hand side of the attack will get the best out of Suarez and Neymar.

Main man: Neymar will join Suarez in attack after the Brazil star recovers from his fractured vertebra

Suarez is banned until October for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup and formally completed his £75million move from Liverpool this week.

The Catalan club are considering whether to launch an appeal over the suspension.

Barcelona must also wait for Neymar to return after the Brazil star fractured a vertebra in his side's quarter-final win over Colombia.

The host nation struggled without their talisman, losing 7-1 to eventual winners Germany in the semi-finals.

Messi, meanwhile, was named Player of the Tournament, despite Argentina's defeat to Germany in the final.
