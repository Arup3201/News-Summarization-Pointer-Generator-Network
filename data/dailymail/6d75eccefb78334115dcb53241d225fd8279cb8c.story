An ostrich-sized bird that is capable of disembowelling a human with its claws has been seen roaming around the English countryside.

The South American rhea, which stands six feet tall and can run at 40mph, has been on the run for two years foiling all attempts to catch it.

The giant flightless bird, which has six-inch claws and could kill with a single blow, was photographed by Steve Lynes near the RAF Odiham base in Hampshire.

The flightless birds, also known as 'Nandu', can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone 

Ron has been on the run for two years defeating all efforts by police, the RSPCA and landowners to catch it

The Rhea, nicknamed Ron, has survived two winters in the wild after escaping from captivity, although it is unclear where from.

It has startled motorists by dashing in and out of traffic on a stretch of road between Long Sutton and Odiham, in Hampshire.

In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate.

The flightless birds, also known as 'Nandu' can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone.  

A statement from Hampshire police countrywatch said: 'Generally the bird keeps itself to itself and clearly appears to be coping with living in the wild. 

'The RSPCA states that there are no concerns for its welfare.'

A spokesman for the RSPCA told MailOnline: 'Rheas are large birds and have the potential to be dangerous as they are strong, fast and have sharp claws. 

'We believe this one escaped from a local resident who owns a smallholding.

'Our advice to the general public is keep well away and call us or the police if they see the bird.

'We would not recommend that anyone attempts to restrain or catch a rhea themselves, as these birds are able to kick in any direction and may kick out if they feel threatened. If anyone does spot the rhea they should contact us.'  

In May, a rhea was shot by a gamekeeper after roaming around a golf course for more than a month after its escape from a smallholding near Royston, in Hertfordshire. 

It was shot because it was feared dangerous, but its owner Jo Clarke, said there was no need to kill it. 

Ms Clarke has kept rheas for many years – among her horses, sheep, geese, ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres.  

The Common Rhea, also known as Rhea Americana or 'Nandu' is native to South American, especially Bolivia, and is often called the South American ostrich.

In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate.

They can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone, with the males being larger than the females. They are omnivores but mainly eat insects, shoots, leaves and grasses.

Rheas have six-inch claws on their feet and large wings that are used in courtship, mating and aggressive displays. Male birds can bite or knock out a person with one blow from their claws, while female rheas are unlikely to be aggressive.

They have a distinctive cry, which sounds more like a big cat's roar than a bird call.  

In South America, rheas, which can live for up to 40 years are farmed for their meat which is low in cholesterol, while in the UK they are increasingly popular as pets.

Rheas are polygamous. Males incubate up to 60 eggs - laid by as many as 12 mates - in a single nest.
