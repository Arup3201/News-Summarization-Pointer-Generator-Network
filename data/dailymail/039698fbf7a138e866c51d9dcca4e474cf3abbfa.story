France was yesterday accused of providing a ‘refuelling stop’ for illegal immigrants trying to get to Britain with plans for a new Sangatte-style refugee camp.

MPs said proposals for housing 400 people near Calais would act as a magnet, encouraging more desperate people to attempt the perilous journey to the UK.

They were also furious at plans to set up ‘welcome centres’ providing help and advice to people seeking to reach Britain’s shores. These may be used to help migrants make applications for asylum in Britain.

The Mayor of Calais today called for the building of a permanent centre for thousands of illegal migrants making their way to Britain

The row began after Calais mayor 
Natacha Bouchart announced plans for a state-funded camp, providing 
shelter, food and washing facilities, for thousands of migrants who pass
 through the port.

In words which have already raised the 
spectre of a new Sangatte, she said that allowing them all 
to sleep rough in her town was 'unsustainable.'

Mayor Bouchart said: ‘Calais is today under an unbearable strain from the highest number of migrants we have ever known.

‘In
 the face of this new situation we cannot stay with our arms folded. I 
am going to propose a solution to the government – the creation of a 
[migrant] centre away from local residents.

‘It
 is the only way to rid the town of this huge migrant presence, which is
 as unbearable for local people as it is for the migrants.’ 

Madame Bouchart will submit her proposal to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve at a meeting on September 2.

Four
 potential sites for the centre have been identified outside Calais but 
their locations have been kept secret for fear of a public outcry.

It is said the centre will be 'far from the town, because if it is close to local 
residents it becomes too tense'.

Natacha
 Bouchart estimated it would 'remove 80 per cent' of those sleeping 
rough, and reassure Calais residents  they were entitled to 'a bit of 
peace'

The
 mayor claims she does not want ‘a new Sangatte’ – the name of the 
notorious Red Cross centre closed in 2002 that was used by 60,000 people
 as a springboard for illegal entry to Britain.

But, faced with an influx of more migrants, Ms 
Bouchart told the Voix du Nord newspaper: 'I would accept the 
construction of this centre if the state agrees to manage it.'

She estimated it would 'remove 80 per 
cent' of those sleeping rough, and reassure Calais residents that they 
were entitled to 'a bit of peace'.

But last night critics said her plan to open a dedicated camp would encourage huge numbers to flock to the Channel port.

Conservative
 MP for Kettering Philip Hollobone said: ‘It’s completely unacceptable 
at every level for the French authorities to provide a refuelling stop 
for illegal immigrants trying to get to Britain. This needs to be raised
 urgently at the highest level with the French government.

‘We
 need to take urgent steps to tighten our border controls at Dover and 
elsewhere to ensure that this new wave of uncontrolled immigration does 
not come to Britain.

‘It’s 
quite clear that these people are not claiming asylum in France. They 
are passing through France and only claiming asylum once they arrive in 
the UK.

‘It’s completely unacceptable for migrants to pass through many other safe countries before claiming asylum in the UK.’

The
 situation has deteriorated in Calais this year because of a new wave of
 immigrants from Eritrea and Ethiopia. Tens of thousands have crossed 
the Mediterranean after the collapse of Libya.

Up to 1,500 migrants are camping out or living in squats run by anarchists in Calais. 

Hundreds more are living in makeshift shelters and tents in woods and sand dunes along France’s north coast.

Calais’
 deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet has warned that the migrant population 
there will rise to up to 5,000 by the end of the year if the situation 
does not change.

Around 1200 migrants - mainly Eritreans, 
Sudanese and Afghans - are currently squatting in disused buildings, or 
living in temporary camps - ones which the French regularly raze.

Violent
 clashes between rival ethnic groups armed with knives and metal bars 
broke out two weeks ago as they fought for the best sites from which to 
clamber on Britain-bound lorries. Outnumbered riot police have been 
unable to control the situation.

There have also been disturbances involving people smugglers who 
charge the equivalent of around £1000 for a passage across the Channel 
in a lorry or car.

Last night Immigration Minister James Brokenshire declined to comment directly on plans for a ‘new Sangatte’ in Calais.

In
 a statement he said: ‘Security at the UK border is our priority and we 
will continue to strengthen it to stop those who have no right to enter 
the UK. 

‘We are taking action at a national and international level to tackle illegal immigration.’

Humanitarian
 workers in Calais welcomed the idea of the camp. One, Philippe 
Wannesson, said: 'It's a change of position, because until now she was 
blocking the suggestion of a shelter and denouncing the squats.

'It's
 positive to reopen the debate, but a centre for 400 people is not 
enough. We need a long-term solution, and a better idea would be smaller
 houses dotted around the centre - rather than a ghetto.

Sangatte was a magnet for immigrants before its closure.

It 
mushroomed from a centre for 400 migrants into a mass shelter for 1200 
people, attracting people smugglers and other criminals to do business 
around it. It was also a place where riots regularly broke out.

It
 was shut in 2002 by the then Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, as 
part of an agreement which saw Britain accepting many of those migrants 
living in it.
