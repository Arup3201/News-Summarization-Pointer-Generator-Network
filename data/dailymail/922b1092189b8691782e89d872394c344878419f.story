It is almost 28 years to the day since Diego Maradona knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, but Gary Lineker let bygones be bygones as the former England striker joked with the Argentina legend about his infamous 'Hand of God' goal.

Lineker took time out from his role as a BBC pundit in Brazil to appear on Maradona's live TV show on Sunday and, in Spanish, joked: 'It is 28 years ago today, right? How's that hand of yours?'

The pair have a history together after the former Leicester forward tracked the World Cup winner to Buenos Aires in 2006 for BBC documentary, 'When Lineker met Maradona'.

Gary Lineker's search of Diego Maradona ahead of the 2006 World Cup - hosted by Germany and won by Italy - saw the ex-England striker meet the Argentina legend in Buenos Aires.

Maradona admitted the 'Hand of God' goal was 'cunning' on his part, but is yet to call it an act of cheating.

It emerged the BBC paid an undisclosed fee to Maradona to appear on the show, with £50,000 the alleged amount.

The pair looked in high spirits joking together in the studio as Lineker first held Maradona's right arm aloft on the daily Venezuelan TV show, before the Argentinian corrected him with his left.

It wasn't all about that infamous goal, though, as Lineker went on to describe Maradona's second, where he took on Peter Reid, Peter Beardsley, Terry Fenwick and Terry Butcher twice, as 'the best I saw in my career'.

The 'Hand of Goal' goal has never sat right with the majority of England fans, least of all that day's goalkeeper Peter Shilton, but Lineker seems to have gotten over the controversy.

It echoes ex-England midfielder Peter Reid who, in 2011, kissed Maradona's hand and called him a 'top man' during a reunion of the 1986 World Cup foes.

Lineker, during his search for Maradona in his documentary ahead of the 2006 World Cup, was told the handball was 'cunning' by the man himself. The Argentina hero is yet to admit to cheating.

The BBC admitted to paying an undisclosed fee to Maradona to appear in the show, with £50,000 the alleged amount.
