For years they have been unfairly regarded as the sole preserve of maiden aunts and respectable ladies of a certain vintage.

Now pearls are replacing diamonds as a staple of the fashion set after being championed by the Duchess of Cambridge, among countless other celebrities.

Elegant pearl earrings - as worn by the former Kate Middleton on last month’s royal tour of Australia and New Zealand - have become a wardrobe must-have.

It’s not just British royalty who are pearl fans. America’s First Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double-stranded pearl necklace and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls.

She wore an eye-catching strand of pearls at the launch of her pop-up shop in New York in February and regularly accessorises her outfits with pearls.

Thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge and 
Sarah Jessica Parker, pearl wearers are becoming younger and championed 
by the fashion faces such as Rihanna and Cara Delevingne.

Makeover: The Duchess of Cambridge teams her pearls with high-fashion outfits for a contemporary look - meaning the gem has suddenly become cool and worn by the likes of Jessie J, left, and Rihanna

So popular have they become that classic sets of the gems are being sold for huge sums by one of the world’s leading auction houses.

Bonhams believes natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity - overfishing and pollution mean the supply of new natural pearls is waning - coupled with the influence of celebrities.

Other pearl fans include singer Katy Perry, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson.

The
 Duchess of Cambridge factor - teaming pearls with high-fashion outfits 
to create a more contemporary look - means pearls suddenly have an 
important new cachet.

Sought after: Bonhams says investors are increasingly snapping up rare natural pearls because of their increasing rarity, do Mariah Carey, left, and Goldie Hawn have lucrative pearls?

The Duchess looked stunning in a set of simple pearl drop earrings visiting Christchurch, New Zealand, last month. But it was not the first time Kate has modelled pearls, and her patronage is introducing them to a new generation.

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams said: 'Pearls were once seen as a bit dated - perhaps the preserve of an older generation, but we’ve seen a complete change in how they are viewed.

'A
 younger fashion set is now completely at home wearing classic pearl 
earrings and you’re as likely to see them in nightclubs and premieres as
 you are at Ascot or the Epsom Derby.'

Really good examples of natural pearl - based on size, uniform shape, lustre and blemish-free skins - do not appear on the market as often as they used to.

Miss Ghika added: “They are a rare commodity and it is often very difficult to find good quality examples. Quite simply, the supply of natural pearls is not going to increase.

'Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly prized. As a result, pearls that have some age, or were part of a historic collection, can be highly appealing to potential buyers and investors.'

The auction house has recently recorded record sales of natural pearls, including a pair of natural pearl and diamond earrings which sold for £290,500 in April - double their estimate.

Through the ages: Long-term, they will become 
more of a rarity and therefore even more highly-prized, said Bonhams of the gem loved by Princess Diana, left, and 
heiress Huguette Clark in the early 1900s

They also auctioned a single natural pearl measuring 11.5mm mounted as a ring, which sold in April for £30,000, ten times the upper estimate and a long single strand of graduated natural pearls measuring 5.5mm-8.5mm,
 which sold for £87,600 in April 2012, more than double the pre-sale 
estimate.

A rare pearl worn as one of a pair of earrings for years has just sold at auction for a world record £811,000.

It
 was worn as jewellery by a lady who had no idea how much it 
was worth and two large round pearls made up the earrings that had been 
given to her as a gift by her husband. He later showed them to experts who identified one of the gems as a natural pearl.

Experts from Woolley and Wallis Auctioneers of Salisbury, Wilts, gave it a pre-sale estimate of £120,000.

But 
competitive bidding drove the hammer price up to £680,000. With all the 
fees added on, the overall price paid was £811,600 and it was bought by 
renowned international jewellers David Morris of London's Bond Street.

It will now be made into a necklace for a potential buyer in Hong Kong.

A pearl is produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusc.

Pearls
 that occur spontaneously in the wild - or 'natural pearls' - are rare 
but extremely valuable and are made up of nearly 100 per cent calcium 
carbonate and conchiolin.

They come in a variety of shapes but, the rounder they are, the more valuable.

Cultured pearls, however, are the result of the a piece of mantle tissue from a shell being transplanted into another shell.

The
 only way to differentiate between natural and cultured is via X-ray at a
 gem-testing laboratory - a cultured pearl will show a different 
structure.

Imitation pearls are made of mother-of-pearl, coral or conch shell.

£2.19m is one of most expensive pearls to be auctioned at Christie's.
