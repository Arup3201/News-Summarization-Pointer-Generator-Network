With its unnervingly-shaped eyes and strange frown-lined mouth it looks like it could be a visitor from another planet.

But a closer look reveals that this is no alien creature from far beyond the stars - but a human being just like you and me.

For Anelia Loubser has flipped images of human faces to create the wonderfully twisted perspectives as part of her Alienation series of photographs.

The Cape Town-based photographer says she was inspired to create the series after reading the words of American motivational speaker Wayne Dyer who said that if you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.

And that's certainly the case here, as eyebrows become odd furry tufts, frowns are turned into mouths and heads seem to transform themselves into chins.

All in all, it's safe to say that these eerie images are certainly out of this world.

Take me to your leader: Wispy tufts of eyebrow hair and deep frown lines make this face look like a creepy alien in close-up

We come in peace: Large wise eyes and a neutral expression suggest that this visitor has the wisdom of the universe in its hands

Helmet off: While this portrait, resembling the creature from the popular Predator series of films, could be an example of a more warlike space traveller

Turning heads: The portraits are part of the Cape Town-based photographer's Alienation series that seeks to challenge our perceptions

Peekaboo: The wide staring eyes belonging to this startled chap would not look out of place in the famous cantina scene in Star Wars

Why so sad? This mournful fellow with a permanent frown seems to have the weight of many worlds resting on its shoulders

Frown turned upside down: This flipped forehead has been transformed into a spectacular square jaw - with a super-sized smile to match

...who famously said that if you change the way you look at things, then the things you look at change

Phone home: This ET lookalike could have problems - he doesn't seem to have a mouth to make the call

The images have all been flipped, cropped and darkened to create a twisted vision of something that's essentially familiarÂ 

Fantastic facial hair: Upside-down eyebrows and a thick head of hair means this fantastic creature appears to have a rather splendid beard

Close encounter: Human faces seem almost unrecognisable after photographer Loubser has finished with them

Live long and prosper: The many lines around the eyes and forehead in this portrait suggest a wise and long-lived existence among the stars
