New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned residents to 'reconcile yourselves with your God' because the 'furious hoarfrost bearing down upon us knows neither mercy or reason'.

The Mayor was poking fun at his over-reaction to the east coast winter storm Juno warnings by reading a article from the satirical newspaper The Onion.

In the story, de Blasio warns New Yorkers about the killer storm, but in reality less than 10 inches of snow fell in the city.

Reality: Despite poking fun at himself, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had to defend his unprecedented, stringent restrictions in the face of the storm, which brought less than 10 inches of snow

The Mayor entertained reporters in City Hall on Tuesday by giving a dramatic reading of the 150-word story which included instructions to 'clutch your babes close to your breast' before the storm arrives.

'All shall meet their death in the coming tempest,' de Blasio said, reading from the satirical piece. 

Although the Mayor took the opportunity to make fun of the situation, he and Governor Andrew Cuomo staunchly defended their unprecedented, stringent restrictions on city residents in the lead up to the storm. 

Both said that they believed in erring on the side of caution and suggested they would take such measures again if presented with a similar situation.

'Would you rather be ahead of the action or behind?' de Blasio asked City Hall. 

'Would you rather be prepared or unprepared? Would you rather be safe or unsafe?

'To me it was a no-brainer: we had to take precautions to keep people safe.'

Before the heavy snows  reached New York, officials closed schools, shut down bridges and tunnels, canceled commuter rail services and, for the first time  in a snowstorm, closed the city's sprawling subway system at 11pm on Monday.

A travel ban was put in place and drivers caught out on the roads faced arrest.

However, the meteorologists whose forecasts prompted the action this week were wrong and the storm, while powerful on Long Island and in New England, dropped less than a foot of snow on the city. 

National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini said his agency should have done a better job of communicating the uncertainty in its forecast.

National Weather Service forecaster Gary Szatkowski tweeted an apology: 'You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn't.'

The decision to lock down the city - particularly closing the subways - drew significant criticism from some business owners and transit advocacy groups.

For de Blasio and Cuomo, however, mistakes made during previous storms likely guided their decisions.

In 2010, New York City was unprepared for a blizzard and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg was out of town. 

The storm resulted in miles of unplowed roads, stranded ambulances and angry residents stuck in their homes for days.

After that debacle, Bloomberg held a series of press conferences before, during, and after expected storms. In these events, the mayor, flanked by his commissioners, delivered an avalanche of statistics to reassure residents of the city's readiness for the approaching snowstorm. 

There were no reported fatalities in New York in the latest storm. The city did, however, lose about $200 million in economic activity due to the  decision to shut down the transit system, according to a preliminary estimate from Moody's Analytics.

Cuomo acknowledged that his decision to act aggressively stems from the historic storm that blanketed Buffalo with seven feet of snow late last year.

'We make big decisions based on these weather forecasts,' the governor said. 

'We decided not to close the roads in Buffalo... and we had people stranded on the roads for 12, 15, 20 hours. You can have a significant loss of life in these situations.' 

To the north of New York in Boston, residents were savaged by a blizzard packing knee-high snowfall and hurricane-force wind.
