For the first time since the crime that made international headlines was pulled off, John Killick has spoken about the moment his lover Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and helped him escape from a Sydney jail.

In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night, Killick revealed just what happened on the day, and during the weeks following, he and his girlfriend executed one of Australians most notorious breakouts.

In 1999, Killick was imprisoned in Silverwater jail, serving time for a series of armed bank robberies. His girlfriend, a librarian originally from Russia, went to see him in jail as often as she could.

Notorious Australian criminal John Killick has revealed to Sunday Night the moment his girlfriend Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and busted him out of a Sydney jail

It was during these visits the pair decided that Killick would break out of prison.

'She was visiting me all the time and you can get three visits a week and she came out three times a week. I rang her as often as I could. And we decide "look um Iâ€™m going to get out,"' Killick told the program.

In preparation for Killick's escape, Dudko took a joy ride over the site where Sydney Olympic Park was being constructed in the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games.

The night before the big day, Dudko ate dinner at the home of Killick's former wife Gloria, where she had been staying since her lover had been locked up.

In another curious detail, the criminal revealed his girlfirend had hired the 1975 action film Breakout, about a woman who hires a pilot to break her husband out of jail and watched it in the week before the real thing.

On March 25, 1999, the Russian librarian jumped in a plane with helicopter pilot Timothy Joyce, under the guise of another scenic tour.

Joyce recounted the moment he knew something was awry, as Dudko was paying particular attention to Silverwater jail.

'I looked over my shoulder... and as I looked back she had pulled a pistol out of her purse and she put it to the side of my head and said "this is a hijack",' the pilot revealed.

Pilot Timothy Joyce also spoke to the program, and told of the moment Killick's lover held a gun to his head

The helicopter hijacked was a Bell 47, and pJoyce was tied up after he was forced to land the aircraft

From there Joyce was forced to land in the grounds of the jail, while Killick jumped in the aircraft and prison officers fired shots in his direction.

He flew the couple about 7 kilometres from the facility, before he was forced to land and tied up the pair who were now on the run.

Killick and Dudko were then forced to flag down a car and hijack it, as Killick recalled his lover admitted 'We have no car - I've forgotten the keys'.

The fugitives drove the vehicle to North Sydney station where they dumped it and jumped on a train to Goulburn, well aware they would have officers hot on their tails.

Killick was only released this year after serving time for a strong of armed robberies and the helicopter escape

For 45 days the couple managed to avoid authorities, as they slowly made their way south to Victoria, changing hair colour along the way and travelling by bus and train.

Their downfall came when they ran out of money and were forced back to Sydney to reclaim money from one of Killick's criminal friends who owed him cash.

In a caravan park on the outskirts of Sydney they were cornered and arrested, and Killick was only recently released from jail for the daring escape.

Just weeks ago, he handed himself in to Brisbane police after he lost a case to be extradited from New South Wales. Killick must now abide to extremely tough parole conditions and wears an ankle monitor full time.
