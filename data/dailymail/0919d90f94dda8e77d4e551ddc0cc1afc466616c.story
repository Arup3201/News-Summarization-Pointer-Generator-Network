A church-going widow in her 80s who waged ‘psychological warfare’ on her soldier neighbour and his family has been told she faces a jail sentence.

Ethel Watkins – known as the Duchess on her middle-class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness – branded the children ‘hooligans’, taunted the wife over the death of her month-old baby and said she hoped the Sergeant Major ‘wouldn’t come back from Afghanistan’.

Yesterday, as the 83-year-old was convicted of harassment, her victim said it made him feel ‘ashamed of being British, if Watkins is the kind of person I have been fighting for’.

'Vile': 83 year-old Ethel Watkins leaves Loughborough Magistrates Court today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail

The soldier, who cannot be named to 
protect the identity of his children, said he had been awarded eight 
medals for service, but would ‘gladly give them up’ if he could 
guarantee peace for his family.

Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her garden

He feared they would never sell their 
home because he would feel ‘honour-bound’ to tell buyers about Watkins.

Watkins’s campaign began when a football landed in her garden shortly 
after the family moved in to the house in Melton Mowbray, 
Leicestershire, in  2011.

The pensioner, a member of the British 
Legion’s Women’s Section for 66 years, has since been kicked out of the
organisation.

She first appeared in court in July to admit harassing the family.

Loughborough magistrates handed her a five-year restraining order, fined
her £900, and warned she had escaped jail only because of her age.

But just 24 hours later, the former Army base stores worker committed the first of four breaches of the order.

The grandmother yesterday returned to the court to deny the breaches.

Watkins told magistrates that far from taunting the family with songs 
about the soldier’s fate in Afghanistan, she was singing her favourite 
hymns, Abide With Me and How Great Thou Art.

But magistrates – who branded her ‘not credible’ – convicted her of the four breaches.

Chairman of the bench Ben Faust told Watkins, who followed the 
proceedings with a hearing aid: ‘We are leaving all our options open 
including prison, or the case being sent to the Crown Court where the 
sentencing powers are far greater.’

The case was adjourned to January 
23.

Abusive: The pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house, as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action

The court heard Watkins regularly insulted the mother with songs she had
made up, and began setting off her own  burglar alarm and banging on 
the walls to prevent the children from sleeping.

Magistrates took just an hour to convict Watkins yesterday. She declined to apologise or comment as she left court.

Watkins married the same man, Ernie Watkins, three times, with the 
couple splitting twice – apparently over her combustible personality.

Mr
Watkins died in 2003. Daughter-in-law Carol Watkins said the 
pensioner’s behaviour had estranged her from her family.

Mrs Watkins, 60, who lives with her maintenance fitter husband Terry, 
also 60, in Melton Mowbray, said: ‘Ethel was difficult from the moment 
we married 40 years ago.

'The last straw was when she tried to break up 
our marriage. I told her to get back on her broomstick and get lost.’

A friend of the victims said they were ‘very happy’.

He added: ‘They say
that it shows that people who complain of harassment will be listened 
to.’
