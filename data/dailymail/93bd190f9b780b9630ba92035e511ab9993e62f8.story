Gaffe: U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told troops they were fighting in Iraq because of the 9/11 terror attacks

The new defense secretary was left red-faced today after he told troops in Iraq that they were stationed there because of the 9/11 terror attacks.

Leon Panetta made the gaffe as he addressed around 150 soldiers at the Camp Victory base in Baghdad.

That explanation was initially used by the former Bush administration to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but has since been firmly dismissed by President Obama and the 9/11 commission.

He told troops: 'The reason you guys are here is because of 9/11. The U.S. got attacked and 3,000 human beings got killed because of Al Qaeda.

'We've been fighting as a result of that.'

The previous administration originally linked the September 11 attacks to former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.

Mr Panetta's spokesman, Doug Wilson, moved quickly to correct the mistake, and added that his boss is a 'plain-spoken secretary', the New York Daily News reports.

He said: 'I don't think he's getting into the argument of 2002-2003.'

'He has made clear that the major threat to this country is coming from Al Qaeda and terrorist groups, and he has also made clear that wherever we are in the world today, that [Al Qaeda] is a principle reason for a military presence.'

When pressed by reporters, he tried to explain his remarks by saying: 'I wasn't saying, you know, the invasion - or going into the issues or the justification of that.

'It was more the fact that we really had to deal with Al Qaeda here, they developed a presence here and that tied in.'

In the same address, he said that the U.S. will take unilateral action against Shi'ite militias armed by Iran who threaten 
American troops.

Last month 14 service members were killed in hostile incidents, the highest monthly toll in three years.

Mr Panetta said: 'We are very 
concerned about Iran and the weapons they are providing to extremists 
here in Iraq.'

Despite U.S. forces officially ending 
combat operations in Iraq last August, troops have come under increasing
fire in recent weeks.

American officials blame Shi'ite militias armed by Iraq's Shi'ite neighbour Iran for most of the recent attacks.             

Rallying the troops: Panetta addressing the troops in Baghdad

At
least three U.S. service members have been killed this month, including
one on Sunday, the day Panetta arrived in Baghdad on his first trip to 
Iraq as defense secretary.              

Washington
still has about 46,000 troops in Iraq more than eight years after the 
2003 invasion overthrew Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.

Forces are due to be withdrawn by the end of the year under a security pact between the two countries.

In
today's address, Mr Panetta said: 'In June we lost a hell of a lot of 
Americans as a result of those attacks. And we cannot just simply stand 
back and allow this to continue to happen.'

Panetta said Washington's first effort would be to press Iraq to go after Shi'ite groups responsible for the attacks.

He is scheduled to meet Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki later on today.

Referring to the right of U.S. forces to defend themselves on Iraqi soil, he said: 'Secondly, to do what we have to do unilaterally, to be able to go after those threats as well, and we're doing that,'

General
Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, declined to comment
on what specific measures unilateral action might 
involve.               

He said:
'I think what the secretary was pointing to was we'll do what's 
necessary to protect ourselves and that could include a host of things 
... so we'll just leave it at that,'

Hours after Panetta's
arrival, 
militants fired three Katyusha rockets into Baghdad's heavily fortified 
Green Zone, home to the massive U.S. embassy complex and Iraqi 
government buildings, according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry source

Officials, including Panetta, have 
been pressing Baghdad to decide whether it wants U.S. forces to stay 
beyond the year-end deadline.

Maliki has said he will abide by a 
decision of the majority of Iraq's political leaders.

Forces in Iraq now operate 
largely in the background, training and assisting Iraqi police and 
soldiers against a weakened but still lethal insurgency that launches 
hundreds of attacks each month.    

Mr Panetta, who as CIA director helped 
oversee the covert raid that killed Osama bin Laden, said his number one
priority since becoming defense secretary was to defeat al Qaeda.

He 
told Congress last month there were still 1,000 al Qaeda fighters in 
Iraq.

His earlier blunder was not the first in his new job.

During a visit to Afghanistan on 
Saturday, he told reporters that America plans to keep 70,000 troops 
there until 2014 - despite Mr Obama's announcement last month that he 
would immediately begin to withdraw troops.

Mr Panetta's office quickly retracted the remark.
