Simon Cowell with his dogs Squiddly and Diddly attending a press launch for Britain's Got Talent

He treats them as if they are his children and used them as part of his ‘baby training’ before becoming a father to son Eric.

Now Simon Cowell has installed an electric fence in his back garden to protect Yorkshire terriers Squiddly and Diddly from the threat of a fox attack.

The TV personality’s decision, after an urban fox was spotted prowling the grounds of his £12million west London home, saw him branded ‘ridiculous’ by neighbours yesterday.

Cowell, 54, bought the puppies last year with his girlfriend Lauren Silverman, 36, and named them after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid, called Squiddly Diddly.

The animals have travelled across the Atlantic with them as Cowell works on each country’s version of X Factor and the Got Talent franchise.

Yesterday, workmen were seen entering his large detached mansion with electrical equipment. 

It is thought the wire, which is similar to that used to keep cattle in fields, would produce a small non-fatal shock that would deter rather than injure any foxes.

Council officials were consulted before the fence was put up to make sure it did not break local government planning laws.

But residents living on the road think it amounts to ‘over-kill’ for two little dogs.

The actress Rosemary Macvie, 78, who has lived on the road her whole life, said: ‘He should not be on this street. He has so much money, he doesn’t know what he wants to do with it.

‘[The electric fence] is dangerous for cats. The foxes don’t harm pets – I’ve seen cats see them off when they’re in the garden.

‘Foxes only come out at night, so why doesn’t he shut his little dogs in?

hey’ve no right to put up this fence – it’s ridiculous.

‘This used to be a proper neighbourhood once where everyone knew each other.’

Another neighbour, Stathes Kulukundis, 72, a shipbroker who has lived on the road for 40 years, said: ‘We have had foxes in the garden and they go for the rubbish. But there are cat owners living on this street and I can see their point of view that they might be harmed by this fence.’

One neighbour, who owns both a dog and cats, added: ‘I’ve lived here for two years and not once seen a fox. It’s overkill. I don’t think he’s put it up for the foxes – that might just be the excuse.’

Before the birth of his son Eric in February, Cowell revealed that the puppies had free run of his homes. The pair slept either at the foot of his king-size bed or on his head.

Cowell and girlfriend Lauren Silverman are concerned that foxes might attack their dogs so have put up an electric fence in their garden to deter the vermin

Cowell has previously revealed: ‘I think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house.

‘This is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun.’

Last year the puppies embarrassed Cowell after Diddly urinated on the floor of a posh boutique in Beverly Hills, California, and Squiddly did its business on their cream carpet while he was being interviewed.

A source close to Cowell and Silverman said: ‘They saw a fox or noticed some fox droppings in their garden and were quite concerned. They love the dogs very much and fear that a fox could quite easily kill them.

‘They have put a wire along one wall where they think the foxes would come from. It’s not fatal but would give a deterrent shock – similar to that used in the countryside by farmers to keep cattle in a secure field.’

A council spokesman said no formal planning permission was needed for the fence.
