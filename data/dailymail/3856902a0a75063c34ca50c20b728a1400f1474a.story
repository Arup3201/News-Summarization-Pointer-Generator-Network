Republican Tennessee Congressman Scott DesJarlais, known for his pro-life position, testified during divorce proceedings that he and his ex-wife made a ‘mutual’ decision for her to have two abortions, according to transcripts released on Thursday.

The 2001 court transcripts were made public by the state Democratic Party, which had tried to air the documents before the November 6 election.

DesJarlais easily won a second term despite revelations that he once urged a 24-year-old patient with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion.

The 48-year-old congressman, whose campaign platform opposed abortion, acknowledged the conversation but said he was only trying to get her to admit she wasn't pregnant.

The transcripts obtained by the Chattanooga Times Free Press show that woman testified under oath that she had been expecting. She declined to elaborate on the outcome of the pregnancy.

On his campaign website, DesJarlais espoused an anti-abortion position, saying: ‘All life should be cherished and protected. We are pro-life.’ The 48-year-old medic also scored a 100 per cent rating from the National Right to Life.

According to DesJarlais' testimony, the first of his ex-wife, Susan's, abortions was because she was taking an experimental drug that carried potential risks in pregnancy. The second came amid problems in their relationship. Both pregnancies were terminated before the couple got married in 1995. 

‘Things were not going well between us and it was a mutual decision,’ he said. ‘I don't think that it was easy for either one of us. I think it was a very difficult and poor choice and I think that there are probably regrets both ways.’

DesJarlais' first wife had supported earlier efforts to release the court records, though her attorney said Thursday he hadn't had time to review them enough to comment.

Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Chip Forrester issued a statement to NewsChannel5 in response to the explosive revelations, saying ion part:

‘Congressman Scott DesJarlais' lies have come home to roost. Just like he abused his power as a doctor and violated the trust of his patients, he has betrayed those who have defended him by deceiving them about his affairs with patients.

Unfaithful: The documents claim that DesJarlais, who ran on a family-values platform, had multiple affairs with at least two patients and several co-workers

‘DesJarlais has acted irresponsibly, his actions are contemptible and his tangled web of deceit is sickening. Scott DesJarlais should be barred from practicing medicine, and he should give up his seat in Congress to make way for someone worthy of the trust that Tennesseans instill in their elected officials.’

The 670-page divorce transcript also revealed that DesJarials who ran on a conservative, family-values platform, had sexual relationships with at least two patients, three co-workers and a drug representative while he was chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper, Tennesse, in 2000 while he was married to first wife.

DesJarlais could potentially lose his medical license since doctors are prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with patients.

According to the American Medical Association, ‘Sexual contact that occurs concurrent with the patient-physician relationship constitutes sexual misconduct.’

During the 2001 divorcé trial, the physician-turned politician challenged the idea that his conduct, which included writing prescriptions for one of his paramours, was in any way reprehensible.

'I don't feel real obligated to respond to that. I think it's ludicrous,' he said.

The release of the divorce documents comes a month after a transcript of DesJarlais' conversation with his former lover was made public, revealing that he pressured the 24-year-old woman tohave an abortion.

'You told me you'd have an abortion, and now we're getting too far along without one,' Dr DesJarlais is quoted as saying. 'If we need to go to Atlanta, or whatever, to get this solved and get it over with so we can get on with our lives, then let's do it.'

The DesJarlais campaign did not dispute the contents of the transcript, first reported by the Huffington Post, but condemned the circulation of 'desperate personal attacks.'

'This
is old news from the last election cycle that Tennesseans have already 
widely rejected,' spokesman Robert Jameson said in an email.

'Since
the congressman's opponents cannot attack him on his independent, 
conservative and pro-life record in Congress they have once again 
resorted to pure character assassination,' he said.

DesJarlais, who has a surgery in Jasper, a suburb of Chattanooga, defeated Democratic Rep. Lincoln Davis in 2010.

Davis
said his campaign was aware of the transcript during that race, but he 
wasn't able to confirm its authenticity until a recent conversation with
DesJarlais' ex-wife Susan. Their divorce was finalized in 2001.

'She said it was true, and she said, "He made the recording himself and let me listen to it,"' said Davis.

'She even went further to say that the woman who supposedly was the participant in the conversation said in (legal proceedings) that she did have an abortion.'

The transcript is part of a 200-page memorandum of court records detailing Dr DesJarlais' divorce.

It's not the first time Dr 
DesJarlais' marital problems have surfaced. The Davis campaign in 2010 
ran ads highlighting allegations from court records that said Dr 
DesJarlais intimidated his ex-wife with a gun, and in one instance put 
it in his mouth for three hours. The judge who granted the divorce in 
2001 criticized the conduct of both the husband and wife.

In the newly surfaced transcript, Dr DesJarlais refers to the toll the marital issues had been taking on him.

'I've
been going crazy,' he said. 'I mean, if Susan could talk to you she'd 
tell you that I've been psychotic for months over this.'

He said he wasn't sleeping at night, adding, 'I mean, it's like I'm trying to build my family back together just waiting for it to fall apart, and it's been eating me apart.'

Dr DesJarlais appears to blame the woman for becoming pregnant.

'You lied to me about something that caused us to be in this situation, and that's not my fault, that's yours,' he said.

The woman retorts: 'Well, it's your fault for sleeping with your patient.'
