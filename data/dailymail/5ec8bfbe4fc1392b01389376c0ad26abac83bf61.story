Michael Johns with his widow Stacey Vuduris in March last year

The best friend of American Idol contestant Michael Johns, who died in August, has claimed that the singer's widow covered up that he was killed by alcohol abuse.

Torrey Gambill and Johns' widow Stacey Vuduris have been involved in a bitter dispute, both filing legal documents against each other.

In the documents, obtained by TMZ, Ms Vuduris claimed that Mr Gambill had been sending her abusive text messages and blaming her for her husband's death.

But in documents of his own, Mr Gambill said Ms Vuduris lied about the Idol star's death after he was found in his apartment in Orange County, California.

Johns died on August 1, aged 35, reportedly from a blood clot which had developed from a sprained ankle, though the autopsy came back inconclusive, pending toxicology results.

It was known that Australian-born Johns had been drinking heavily before his death, though it is not certain how soon before.

In the legal documents filed by Mr Gambill, texts are quoted from Ms Vuduris saying: 'I'd rather it be said he died at home if that's ok with u .. he would want that,' and 'I rather that then "alcoholic" stuff ... his good friends would never say anything ... so I don't think that will come out. At least blood clot sounds sudden.' [sic]

He also claimed that the couple were separated when Johns died, that Ms Vuduris may have had a boyfriend and that she had been the cause of his friend having a very difficult year.

According to TMZ, the feuding pair managed to settle their dispute without a judge's order.

Shortly before his death, Johns had sprained his ankle and it swelled to his knee. He sought medical attention the day before he died, though it is not known whether he was taking pain relief for the injury.

He reportedly died in his sleep and was in full cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived on the scene, and could not be revived.

He was said to be in huge amounts of pain from the injury in the lead up to his death. 

Johns was born and brought up in Australia, before moving to America when he was 18 after he met and received advice from his idol - You Am I frontman Tim Rogers.

Simon Cowell was one of many who took to Twitter to show his sadness at Johns' passing

His family, who live in Perth, spoke of their devastation but said that they had been supported by the love of his fans around the world.

In a statement, they said, 'Our family is devastated by the passing of our beloved Michael, a wonderful husband, son, brother, uncle, and friend.

'We appreciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from all corners of the globe. Please keep Michael in your thoughts and respect our need to grieve privately in this difficult time.'

Johns met Ms Vuduris in 2003 and married her in 2007, before competing in the seventh season of American Idol in 2008. During the show his supporters called themselves 'The Aussie Posse'.

He finished eighth in the show, during which he got to rehearse with Dolly Parton, and went on to release an album which sold 20,000 copies. He planned to release a new album, titled 'Reckless', later this year.
