A pilot whose passenger plane was stuck on the tarmac at Manchester Airport for three hours due to snow delays called police after getting frustrated at the hold-up. 

Passengers on board the Germanwings flight to Hamburg said the pilot became so frustrated at the long wait and the lack of response from airport staff that he dialled 999.

The plane was waiting to be 'de-iced', but many complained there only seemed to be one vehicle equipped to remove snow from all the planes and some claimed it broke down at one point.

Officers boarded the plane which was carrying 150 passengers at around 11pm, but took no action.

A number of flights to destinations including Belfast, Paris and Hamburg were unable to take off at the airport after a snow storm and plummeting temperatures meant conditions were not safe. 

After a long delay, the Hamburg flight was rescheduled to set off at 10.15pm, but had still not left by 11pm.

Passenger Adrian Adam, 30, said the pilot, attempting to contact airport staff or operator Germanwings, became so frustrated at waiting, he eventually called the police.

'After being delayed for that long, we couldn't land in Hamburg because they don't allow flights in after 11pm,' said Mr Adam who lives in Hamburg had been visiting family in St Helens for Christmas.

'We were waiting, like a lot of other planes, to be de-iced. There was one for all the planes that were waiting.

'No-one was coming back to the pilot, so eventually he called the police. He said he couldn't tell us anything because he couldn't get hold of anyone - he said no-one was responding.

'It was getting pretty hot and all the food was gone. There was about 150 people on the plane, people were getting frustrated.'

A spokesman for Manchester Airport insisted the airport was 'operational', despite some delays because of planes needing to be de-iced.

He said he couldn't comment on the specific incident on the plane due to set off to Hamburg.

'We're operational, things are taking a bit longer than usual, but we're doing what we can and flights are coming in,' said the spokesman.

Greater Manchester Police confirmed officers had been on the plane after a call from the pilot.

He said despite the pilot's claims that passengers were agitated, those on board were calm and officers did not have to remove anybody.

It is understood that when police left the plane, some passengers followed and others remained on board after being told the flight would be diverted to Hannover.

Passengers on board a flight to Belfast were left waiting for more than four hours on the tarmac, according to reports, but were eventually ushered off the plane and back into the terminal. 

Natalie Merchant said: 'Spent a week in an alpine country and where do we get stranded thanks to snow? Manchester Airport.'

Alan Wilson, who was left stranded in the airport after waiting four-and-a-half hours on a plane due to go to Belfast, said: 'If you turn up four minutes late for one of their flights, you won't get on. And yet we're left waiting for four hours.'

Both Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Leeds Bradford International in Yorkshire closed last night while their runways were cleared of snow.
