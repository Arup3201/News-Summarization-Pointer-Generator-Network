Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood may soon  be doing his bit for breast cancer, as new daughter-in-law Fearne Cotton calls in a few family favours for her annual charity music festival, Festifeel.

Profits go to breast charity Coppafeel,  which aims to take the fear out of breast self-examination.

‘So many women are scared to check their boobs because they don’t know what they will find, which is silly when you are more likely to be saved if you find something early,’ Fearne said.

Famous friends: Fearne Cotton has said she will be calling in a few family favours for her annual breast cancer charity festival Festifeel

The success of previous one-day Festifeels – this year’s was a sellout – has given Fearne the confidence to think big and she wants the event to become a much larger affair, complete with top-name headliners.

Kasabian and McFly should also expect calls from the presenter – both bands were at her wedding to Ronnie’s son Jesse in June.

‘I want it to be as big as Glastonbury,  with camping and everything,’ Fearne said last week.

So will the Stones be playing? ‘Let’s just say I’m going to call in a lot of favours,’ she said.

Good news for the long-of-limb: tall 
people are less likely to suffer asthma and acute heart disease.

And 
extra height makes women, specifically, less prone to depression and 
anxiety.

Research, based on 28,000 people aged 25 to 79, showed that 
healthy women were on average 2.5cm taller than those who reported bad 
health. In men, the difference was 4cm.

Height is thought to be affected
 by nutrition and socio-economic conditions in childhood.

Tan on: Actinica is Britain's first medically approved sun lotion

The first medically approved sun lotion has been launched, with the aim of reducing the number of Britons developing skin cancer.

Actinica has been licensed as a medical device after extensive hospital trials. It  was found that its use reduced by half the risk of developing a non-melanoma skin cancer, the majority of skin  cancer seen in Britain.

Actinica contains photostable UV filters  and protects skin from UVA and UVB rays.

Your own finances may be a source of stress – but neighbours’ money worries could also damage your health.

A new study found that people living within 100 yards of a home that was being repossessed tended to have higher blood pressure – and that it rose further for every extra repossessed property within the same radius.

The survey by University of Illinois researchers involved 1,740 people living in Massachusetts between 1987 and 2008.

Poor air quality may increase the risk of dementia. The dramatic effect on mental decline of those in more polluted areas was equivalent to being up to three years older, say researchers from the University of Southern California medical school.

Air that contains small or fine particle pollution is especially harmful because once inhaled, particles can travel through the circulation system and damage the heart, lungs and brain. Dr Jennifer Weuve, of Rush University in Chicago, says: ‘If this is a cause, it can be modified using regulatory intervention.’

Overweight people don’t see the dangers of their condition in images of others like them.

In a study in Bath, nearly 600 people were shown messages about the dangers of being overweight, with a photo of an overweight model, a morbidly obese person, or no photo.

Overweight peope who viewed the morbidly obese image perceived risks to start at a far higher weight than those who saw no picture.
