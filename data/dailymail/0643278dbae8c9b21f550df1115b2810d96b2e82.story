An adorable baby gorilla born on Wednesday at the San Diego Zoo by a rare animal c-section underwent successful surgery for a collapsed lung.

The 4.6 pound baby gorilla girl was born with breathing problems and after veterinarians performed a chest x-ray they discovered the collapsed organ.

On Friday morning veterinarians, a neonatal specialist named Dawn Reeves and an anesthesiologist from the University of California, San Diego Health System gathered to perform the life-saving procedure, reports NBC.

Reeves
 told the Telegraph that the the baby gorilla is different than human 
babies because it can grab things with both its hands and feet.

Park officials say that the baby's 
mother, 18-year-old Imani, went into labor on Wednesday morning and was 
showing no signs of progress until later that evening.

NBC
 reports that's when doctors took Imani to the Safari Park veterinary 
hospital for an emergency operation, with the help of experts in human 
c-sections.

'In retrospect the c-section was the right decision,' said the park’s Associate Director of Veterinary Services Nadine Lamberski in a release.

'We think the health of the fetus would have been compromised if we delayed the surgery any longer.'

A cesarean delivery, also known as a c-section, is a 'surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision in the mother's abdomen and a second incision in the mother's uterus,' according to mayoclinc.com.

The operation was performed by the talented San Diego Zoo Global team and also by a veterinary surgeon and a neonatal specialist from UC San Diego medical Center.

The baby gorilla, who has not yet been named, weighs 4.6lbs.

She is currently in intensive care at a veterinary hospital after suffering complications during birth.

The little gorilla is being provided with oxygen and fluids and her mother is in the bedroom area.

The Mail Online tried contacting the park for updates on the gorilla's health but no one was available for comment.

This is Imani's first baby gorilla but the park's 17th.
