Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale has expressed his desire to stay at the club after rumours circulated that Manchester United were lining up a summer move for the Welshman.

Bale won the Champions League with Los Blancos last season and has been a key figure in the side which have won their last 22 competitive matches.

Real president Florentino Perez on Tuesday warned off any potential bids for the 25-year-old, who joined from Tottenham 16 months ago in a world-record £86million deal, saying: 'We would never listen to any offer for Bale, no matter what the fee.'

Gareth Bale says he is happy at Real Madrid, the club he joined in the summer of 2013 to win trophies

Bale has been in good form recently as the club have put together a 22-game winning run 

And Bale, who is currently with his team-mates in Dubai on a mid-season tour, is more than happy to stay in the Spanish capital.

'Go to Manchester United? I am very happy in Madrid, a city, a climate and a club that I love,' he told Dubai TV.

'My contract ends in 2019 and I could sign a renewal.

'I am very happy at Madrid and I hope to win many more titles in the future.

'It has been a fantastic year for me. I wanted to come to Real Madrid to win titles and work alongside the best players and that is exactly what I have done in a single year. I hope that we keep improving, winning more titles and that I can keep giving my all.'

Bale has struck an important partnership with Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo in the Real front line, with the trio contributing 57 goals so far this term.

'He (Ronaldo) is an impressive player,' Bale added. 'Everybody knows what he is like - it is great to be playing alongside him. What he does so that the team can keep winning and improving is fantastic.

'The forwards we have are extremely good. The three of us really like playing together. We work very well together, as we demonstrated last season with the titles we won.

'The potential we have up front is fantastic and we want to keep improving.'
