You may recognise the name Randi Zuckerberg following her integral marketing role at a little site called Facebook, which was, coincidentally, founded by her brother, Mark.

While at the company, she pioneered and ran the social media marketing programs for the brand and introduced Facebook's live-streaming initiatives.

Since then, however, the tech-savvy founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media and the Editor-in-Chief of Dot Complicated, has made it her mission to help others unplug from their wired, technology-filled lives.

Randi Zuckerberg has made it her mission to help you 'unplug' while on holiday with Celebrity Cruises

Thus, the 'Take Care of Your Selfie' collaboration with Celebrity Cruises' Canyon Ranch SpaClub was born.

The year-long programme, which encourages guests to find a tech-life balance while on holiday, kicked off this month with a new line-up of specially designed spa treatments and services on board.

With offerings like 'fACEial Time,' which is a facial designed to treat skin care needs relating to staring at a computer and tablet screens, and the 'texticure' manicure complete with softening paraffin wax, the treatments are as witty as they are relaxing. 

And it's the manicure that's Zuckerberg's favourite, as it forces her to take a break from responding to emails.

Along with the luxury liner, Zuckerberg has crafted a menu of tech-specific detox spa treatments

'It’s so luxurious and immediately moisturises your hands,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'And because they’re in gloves, you can’t even send a text message while you’re getting it.'

Zuckerberg's interest in the precarious tech-life balance, as she calls it, first began when she was researching her book Dot Complicated: Untangled Our Wired Lives.

'I'd been thinking so much about the wonderful opportunities that technology presents in our lives, but I was also talking to a lot psychologists and observing how our behaviours with tech aren't always helping,' she explains.

'We tend to border on addictive and obsessive - in fact, the average person checks their phone 150 times a day.

'Because technology is new and magical, we haven't quite established balance and boundaries.'

The average person checks their phone 150 times per day, so it's important to make an effort to disconnect

But that's not to say Zuckerberg doesn't understand the appeal and that she isn't guilty of over-checking her mobile herself from time to time.

'I'm a working mum with two young children, so I feel like technology is my lifesaver and the whole reason that I can be doing what I'm doing,' she says. 

'But being always connected can be a blessing and a curse, especially when you feel like you're always reachable.

'And when you're on holiday, those little devices in your pocket make it so easy. I call it 'snacking.' It's that moment when you have a minute of downtime, but instead of thinking about something creative, it's easy to mindlessly whip out your phone and scroll through feeds.'

Zuckerberg's trick is to keep her phone in another room during family time and keep the attention on her kids

So, what's her advice to keep 'snacking' at a minimum - both while on holiday and at home?

'I try to put my phone in a different room at home,' she tells MailOnline Travel. 'When you're with your family, it's about quality time. Make eye contact and put the phone away.'

But most of all, Zuckerberg wants people to understand that it's simply not possible to do every single thing on your to-do list every single day. So, instead, pick a few things to focus on and - especially when you're on holiday - be sure to take time to relax and fit in the odd spa treatment.

'I have a mantra,' she says. 'It's five words that I repeat: work, sleep, friends, family, fitness.'

'Pick three. You can't pick five because it's impossible to do all five well everyday. 

'As long as it balances out in the long run, you should feel happy and proud.'
