A Harvard law professor named with Prince Andrew in a 'sex slave' case today insisted that he never saw anything improper at the home of their billionaire pedophile friend, Jeffrey Epstein.

Alan Dershowitz's claims on Thursday came just one day after accuser Virginia Roberts said in new court filings that the lawyer would chat with Epstein as she performed a sex act on the billionaire.

Speaking in an emphatic interview on the Today show , Dershowitz again accused Roberts of 'making the whole thing up' and said her lawyers are putting 'real' rape victims 'in a terrible position'.

'I was never in the presence of a single underage woman,' he said. 'I never saw [Epstein] doing anything improper. I was not a witness. I was not a participant. And I will prove it.'

Lashing out: Lawyer Alan Dershowitz appeared on the Today show on Thursday to slam claims that he had sex with an underage girl who was supplied to him by billionaire pedophile Prince Andrew

Dershowitz was named last month in court documents by Roberts, who claims she was forced to have sex with friends of Epstein, including the Duke of York, when she was just 17.

On Wednesday, she lodged fresh documents in Florida detailing the alleged abuse she suffered at the duke's hands, including how she had an orgy with him and eight other young girls.

But on Thursday, Dershowitz said that, while Roberts claims she had sex with him at Epstein's Caribbean Island and his New Mexico ranch, he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter.

He claims that the third accusation - that he had sex with Roberts on a private plane - is false and that flight manifests will prove he was never aboard the plane with her. 

'I've ever seen her and I've never met her,' he insisted. 'She is categorically lying and making the whole thing up... This is Pinocchio's nose growing longer and longer.'

He insisted that his relationship with Epstein had been entirely 'academic' and that he had only ever met with him in the presence of dignitaries and professors.

He added that, despite her lawyers' claims, he has agreed to be deposed so that he can speak about the allegations.

Together: Dershowitz said any legal success he has against the woman, Virginia Roberts (pictured with Prince Andrew), will work in the royal's favour as it will discredit his accuser

'Of course I will be deposed, he said. 'I have been absolutely upfront. The lawyers are lying through their teeth when they say I have refused to be deposed.' 

'I'm happy to have this out in a court of law... I'm afraid of nothing, I'm hiding nothing. She is afraid of repeating this in public.'

Speaking of Roberts' lawyers, he went on: 'They have put rape victims in a terrible position... because when I unequivocally prove that they sat down and made this all up, tragically it will hurt real rape victims, and it shouldn't because you shouldn't generalize.' 

Dershowitz has previously urged the Duke of York to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of Florida.

Prince Andrew is expected to comment about the accusations later on Thursday, in what would be an unprecedented move for a royal.

The palace previously issued a vehement denial on Prince Andrew's behalf.

'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts,' a spokesperson said. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.'

Roberts called the denial 'false and hurtful to me'. 

Following her most recent filing, a Buckingham Palace spokesman added this week: 'We have nothing to say in addition to our earlier comments on the issue.'

Old friends: Prince Andrew came under fire after he was pictured with Epstein following his prison term in 2011

Roberts claims she had sex with the Prince, a former friend of Epstein, in New York, London and the U.S.Virgin Islands while she was a 'sex slave'. Buckingham Palace has denied all allegations.

In the documents, she said her lawyers had served a letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he 'refused' to accept it.

She also described the alleged abuse in new and startling detail.

She claimed Prince Andrew correctly guessed she was just 17 when he met her, and how she was instructed to give him anything he wanted.

His police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time they had sex, she said.

'Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times,' she said. 'I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him 'Andy.'

After they had sex, she was paid $15,000, she said. 

Prince Andrew's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the Palace is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life.

Anger: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied

But Dershowitz said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to Prince Andrew as it would serve to discredit his accuser.

Earlier this month, he filed a sworn statement in Florida and defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Roberts' lawyers' public statements about the case.

He has also challenged them to sign sworn statements repeating their charges.

Dershowitz has also filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them.

The court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion.

The two lawyers representing Jane Doe #3, former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs attorney Bradley Edwards, have now filed counter-defamation charges against Dershowitz.

In an earlier article, he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions. If they repeat the charges under oath, and if they are untrue, they will be subject to prosecution for perjury. 

Support: Dershowitz's wife Carolyn (pictured with their daughter), has spoken out in support of her husband

In a previous statement to DailyMail.com, Mr Cassell said that he and Mr Edwards would not be responding to 'specific claims of indignation by anyone'.

'We have been informed of Mr Dershowitz's threats based on the factual allegations we have made in our recent filing,' he said in a statement.

'We carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them... We would be pleased to consider any sworn testimony and documentary evidence Mr Dershowitz would like to provide which he contends would refute any of our allegations.'

Finally, Dershowitz has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him. If she were to file a false rape charge, she would be committing a crime. She has not done so.

It comes a week after Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'.

In a passionate rebuttal on the Today show last Tuesday, the Duchess of York said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations.
