With its pristine slopes, spectacular views and seemingly endless supply of glühwein, it's no surprise that St. Moritz has been pulling in the tourists for more than 150 years.

But what do you do if skiing isn't your thing? Not everyone likes wobbling through the snow at a 90 degree angle and coming to a chilly stop in a snowdrift.

That, however, doesn't mean there isn't anything for non-skiers to do in the Graubünden mountain town. As I discovered over a sisters-only weekend in the mountains, there's plenty of choice - provided you don't mind getting cold.

Celebrations: St. Moritz is celebrating its 150th year as a winter sports destination this year

One of the loveliest parts of a holiday in St. Moritz is the journey there on the Glacier Express; a beauteous trip that takes in soaring peaks, plunging gorges and some of the brightest blue water this side of the Mediterranean.

As the town draws nearer, the peaks get snowier - this year included. While the lake on which St. Moritz sits remains resolutely liquid, the peaks are as starkly white as ever.

We were staying at the Hotel Schweizerhof, a central pile a stone's throw from the station, although the efficient reception desk sent down a car rather than making us drag our suitcases through the snow.

Inside, it was beautifully warm and decked out in aristocratic style, with draped curtains, acres of gold gilding and luxuriously thick red carpets.

Upstairs, corridors painted a plain cream and enlivened with antique paintings spread out in every direction, including the one that led to my room - a spacious twin with a little ensuite bathroom encased in what looked like a colossal walnut cupboard.

Travel in style: Arriving in St. Moritz means a journey through the mountains on the Glacier Express

From the window, I could see the towering peaks that rear up behind the town, including the magnificent Corviglia - home to some of St Moritz' best ski slopes.

I headed up there the next day just to make sure that I definitely wasn't in the mood to ski and found myself enchanted by the stunning views, if less so by the vast Audi branded cafe plonked next to the lifts.

With us was Australian ski instructor John, a man of endless bons mots and inexhaustible patience, even when faced with sisters demanding a hot chocolate break at regular intervals.

During one of these, he revealed his top tips for skiing success, among them leaning forward ('it stops you falling over'), and the intricacies of the snowplough slowing technique.

He also had some wisdom on the subject of choosing ski instructors to share - the older, the better being his mantra.

'It's because they understand why beginners are scared,' he added. Peering over the edge of a steep (for me) blue run slope, I couldn't help but agree.

One blistered shin and a tumble later, I was ready to head down the mountain and get to grips with the real purpose of the exercise - the apres ski.

First though, I had an appointment with local chocolatier Hauser to discover the secrets of another Swiss tradition - chocolate.

Upstairs a classic Swiss cafe complete with a cheerful counter and a mind-boggling array of chocolates and pastries, downstairs was a warren of tiny kitchens, each of which contained a culinary whizz painstakingly producing a series of toothsome creations.

Not all were small, however, among them a chocolate version of the Glacier Express emerging for a tunnel which was due to go on display in the shop, although not for sale.

Chocolate bubbled in vats all around, carefully kept at 32 degrees - the perfect temperature for successful sweet making apparently - while piles of nuts could be seen slowly being transformed into Engadin's traditional (and utterly delicious) caramel nut cake.

Interesting though the process was, the real excitement came when we got to eat some of the wares, including a gorgeous white chocolate and vodka creation and a gin version that was a little like slurping a chocolate-encased shot.

That the most unlikely of chocolate and alcohol combinations proved tasty is no surprise in St. Moritz, a town where fondue is this dish du jour and glühwein is practically served on tap.

But you don't always have to have the cheese variety. At the Schweizerhof's Restaurant Acla, we tried the Fondue Chinoise which swaps bread for meat and cheese for broth.

It was delicious - as was the red Valais wine served to wash it down and the Chateaubriand ordered by my (very hungry) sister.

Yet for all that, nothing tastes like Switzerland quite so much as a real cheese fondue and luckily for us, the very next day, we found the perfect place to eat it.

Having decided not to go skiing and ruled out the painful cross-country skiing alternative, we opted instead for a gentle ride through the Fex Valley in a horse-drawn carriage.

Bundled up in layers of rugs, we huddled up on the cushioned seats and watched as the steep-sided valley and its diminutive stone houses slid past.

Isolated: The Valley, which stretches towards the Italian border, is home to just 700 people

Alternative: If you don't fancy riding, cross-country skiing is fun for the very fit

Close to the village of Sils Maria, the Valley stretches towards the Italian border and is flanked by craggy peaks.

In the summer, it is a riot of alpine flowers and gently munching cows but winter brings thick snow and a total ban on cars. Based on what we saw, they'd only get stuck anyway.

There is, nonetheless, a tiny village in the middle - Fex - which even boasts its own little hotel, the unimaginatively named Hotel Fex.

What was not unimaginative was the menu, which along with Swiss classics such as schnitzel and rösti, also included one of the tastiest cheese fondues I've ever had and a crisp local white wine to go with it.

Back in St. Moritz and still not quite ready for serious exercise, we took a leisurely walk to the Segantini Museum which is perched on a hill overlooking the lake.

Built in 1908, it is dedicated to Italian painter Giovanni Segantini who lived locally during the later years of his life and took inspiration from the craggy Engadin region as well at St Moritz itself.

Thrills and spills: A bobsled ride doesn't come cheap but it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face

A stay at the Hotel Schweizerhof St Moritz starts at CHF529 (£344) per person, per night during January.Schweizerhofstmoritz.ch.

Home to more than 20 paintings, the most famous is his vast Life, Nature, Death triptych which is hung in the Museum's upper room.

Featuring striking Alpine scenes, plenty of Segantini's trademark cows and farmers and a spectacular view of St Moritz, it remains one of his most popular works.

Fascinating though the Museum was, not everyone wants to spend a winter holiday updating their knowledge of art and so, it was finally time for something more high octane.

At 250 Swiss Francs (£162), a trip on the St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun doesn't come cheap but if it doesn't put a smile on your face, nothing will.

The 75 second journey sees you hurtle along an Alpine road, through several tunnels and round a corner of eye-watering sharpness.

It's fascinating afterwards too. Built in 1903 for guests from the UK, the track has played host to everyone from royals to sporting stars, among them participants in not one but two Winter Olympic Games.

Some of the trophies and medals can still be seen in the bobsleigh bar where, for the price of a drink or two, locals will happily regale you with stories of daring bobsledders past.

And if you don't fancy that, there's always ice skating on the lake. With spectacular views of the surrounding slopes and the departing Glacier Express, it gives skiing a serious run for its money.
