The married French scholar whose naked body was found in a New York hotel room on Tuesday had been trawling through gay hook-up websites on his laptop before he died, police said.

Richard Descoings, 54, director of the prestigious Paris Institute of Political Studies, was found sprawled across a bed in the Michelangelo Hotel in Manhattan and police are searching for two men who visited his room on Monday evening.

His widow, who was flying to New York from France the day his body was found, told police her husband was 'really into men', according to the New York Post.

Couple: Richard Descoings with his wife Nadia, who said she was aware of her husband's homosexuality before and when she married him

Sources told the paper that Nadia 
Marik-Descoings said she was aware of her husband's homosexual interests
 'before she met and married him'. 

The couple attended a function in France when George Bush welcomed Nicolas Sarkozy

The French academic - who is a friend of President Sarkozy - had recently believed there was a 'plot' against him.

His luxury room had been ransacked, and his laptop and cellphone were found on a third-floor ledge, possibly tossed from his window.

An autopsy performed yesterday was 
inconclusive pending toxicology tests. But there were no obvious signs 
of trauma on the body.  Alcohol and prescription drugs were found in the
 room.

Mr Descoings was earning approximately $425,000 per 
year as director of the Sciences-Po institute of political science in 
Paris – a prestigious college where Dominique Strauss-Kahn once taught. 

In recent years, Mr Descoings had been criticized by some right-wing politicians for opening up Sciences-Po to
 underprivileged students, often from ethnic minority backgrounds.

This had led to what the married Mr 
Descoings viewed as a smear campaign, which included being forcibly 
‘outed’ as a homosexual in Le Monde – the pro-government ‘establishment’
 newspaper.

In an interview with the left-wing 
Liberation just two months ago, Mr Descoings was asked directly if he 
feared a plot against him.

He replied: ‘I reject any paranoia. It’s possible, but I prefer to be naive rather than to speculate.

‘What I see is that at a given moment,
 they started talking about sex, money and culture in general. We had my
 forced outing in the columns of Le Monde.

‘I do not see what my alleged 
homosexuality had to do with anything. This also happened at the time of
 my marriage. The answer? That I’m not homosexual ?

'No, nothing. When 
you’re not married, no-one has the right to mention that you’re with 
someone, it’s the secret of a private life.’

He had been due to attend a conference at Columbia University but did not show up on Tuesday morning.

Colleagues subsequently phoned the hotel. When staff members first went to his room, they believed they heard snoring.

One report even says that a hotel 
staffer went in to check on him, and Mr Descoings woke up with a grunt 
before going back to sleep.

When Mr Descoings still did not appear
 at the conference, and missed the 12.30pm check out time, hotel staff 
waited 30 minutes before visiting his room again. Inside, they found Mr 
Descoings' nude body and the room in disarray.

While there was no indication of 
forced entry into his room, there were signs that more than one person 
may have been in the room with Mr Descoings.

Friends of the well-regarded academic, who was known for his push for education reform in France, said that he was depressed.

Authorities are not ruling out suicide
 but they are also looking into the comings and goings of one or two men
 who were seen visiting Mr Descoings' room in the days leading up to his
 death.

The institute which Mr Descoings led, 
known in French as the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (or 
colloquially as 'Sciences Po') is one of France's most distinguished 
academic institutions and widely regarded as an elite school for future 
high-ranking officials and politicians.

Because of his role in the French 
government, along with his strong push for the inclusion of 
underprivileged students in Frances' most prestigious university, Mr 
Descoings was a friend of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and he 
released a statement in the wake of the news.

'In almost 16 years as the head of 
‘Sciences Po,’ he made of that venerable institution, which he reformed 
profoundly, an establishment with a global reputation,' Mr Sarkozy said.

During Mr Descoings' tenure at the 
university, the number of scholarship students increased from 6 per cent
 to 26 per cent, showing his dedication to opening up higher education.

The investigation into the death of 
Descoings is the second major investigation in a year to be launched by 
New York police involving a major French personality.

Last year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 
then head of the International Monetary Fund, was arrested after a hotel
 chambermaid accused him of sexual assault. The charges against 
Strauss-Kahn were later dropped, but he is still facing a civil suit.
