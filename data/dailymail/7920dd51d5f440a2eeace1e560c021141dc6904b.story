A shocking study has revealed that nearly one in three children in Britain have contemplated suicide by the age of 16.

Stress over exams, fear of failure and concern about body image are just some of the pressures harming teenagers' mental health, the major survey discovered.

The worrying findings by MindFull.org - a new website launched today which aims helping youngsters find counselling - has led to growing calls for teens to be given mental health lessons in school.

The report, called Alone with my thoughts, based on the experiences of more than 2,000 16- to 25-year-olds across Britain, said: 'We are at risk of failing a generation 
of young people'.

It added that a 'transformation in the way we address young 
people’s mental health' was needed.

It also recommended 
mental-health lessons be included as part of the national curriculum, with counselling in
schools, and improved services which address the needs of children and 
are focused on 'early intervention'.

Research showed that 32 per cent of young Britons have had suicidal thoughts, while a similar proportion (29 per cent) of young adults deliberately harmed themselves as teenagers.

And more than one in 10 (12 per cent) felt a failure almost every day when they were under 16.

Issues around anxiety, stress and 
body image lead to poor emotional wellbeing, leaving children less able 
to cope. Unchecked, this can spiral into acute, long-term mental 
illness, says the report

And the problem was compounded as a taboo surrounding discussing mental health issues prevented many teenagers seeking help, the report found.

It called for more services to be provided to prevent a generation falling victim to suicide and self-harm.

Founder and chief executive of MindFull Emma-Jane Cross said too many children are 'being let down or simply ignored,'

'It’s
unacceptable that so many are having to resort to harming themselves on
purpose in order to cope, or worse still are thinking about ending 
their own lives.'

And Lucie Russell, director of policy,
YoungMinds, said: 'These shocking statistics highlight what YoungMinds 
has been saying for many years – that... young people’s mental health is
a vital issue that must be prioritised.'

MindFull, an offshoot of the 
BeatBullying charity, is backed by clinical psychologist Professor Tanya
Byron, Labour leader Ed Miliband, and child-protection expert Professor
Eileen Munroe.

It will work with schools to educate 
young people on how to cope with mental-health issues, and has created a
website to give free, confidential counselling for 11- to 17-year-olds.

Of the 850,000 young people with a diagnosable mental-health problem, almost 75 per cent get no treatment, says the report.

And for those who do, cuts to mental-health services often mean they don’t receive the long-term, intensive treatment they need.

Mental
health should be given the same importance as physical health, 
according to Professor Byron.

Welcoming the new mindfull.org website, 
she said: 'Teenagers naturally look to the internet as a source of 
information and advice, so that’s where we need to be in order to help 
the hundreds of thousands of young people who are getting no support.'

And
Barbara Rayment, chair of the Children & Young People’s Mental 
Health Coalition, said: 'As a society we have taken many steps to ensure
the increased physical health of our young people, we now need to 
ensure we make as good an investment in their mental health.'
