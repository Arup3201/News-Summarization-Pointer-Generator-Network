Happy New Year!

The festive season is sadly over and it’s back to work and reality for most of us now. 

All that eating, drinking and partying during Christmas and New Year can really take its toll on the complexion, so I’ve decided a January skin-detox is due. Out with the old products, and in with the new.

Binky's New Year's beauty resolution is to detox her skin and regain a healthy complexion 

It’s always a good idea to switch up your skincare routine every so often to correlate with your skin’s needs for the season, so this week I thought I’d share with you some of the products I’m using to revive my dull, tired post-Christmas complexion.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few weeks, you’ll have heard that the French Pharmacy classic La Roche-Posay Serozinc is now available to buy in the UK – exclusively at Escentual.com – and this little gem has completely transformed my skin.

Serozinc is a zinc-sulphate enriched toning mist that has been applauded by bloggers, beauty writers and dermatologists around the world, and until a few days ago you’d have to venture across the pond to get hold of it – so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard I was finally going to be able to try it!

The toner only has three ingredients – zinc sulphate, sodium chloride and thermal spring water. The simple yet highly effective formulation targets spots and blemishes, calming redness and with continued use leaving the skin looking and feeling clean and fresh. It’s hypoallergenic and non-perfumed too, making it suitable for acne-prone skin.

As part of her skin revamp Binky had  a Skinbreeze Hydro Mask, the gel mask has powerful antioxidants that reduce redness and smooth fine lines and wrinkles 

It also mattifies oily skin and prevents shine, as well as tightening the appearance of pores for an altogether more radiant and clear complexion.

Serozinc can be used as a daily toner between cleansing and moisturising, as well as during the day whenever your skin needs refreshing. 

I’ve been using it morning and night as part of my skincare routine for a few weeks now and the amount of angry red marks or blemishes popping up on my skin has drastically reduced – my complexion feels clear, clean and fresh. Serozinc is selling fast, though, so make sure you get your mitts on it while you still can!

Binky also tried out Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask said to give you a radiant glow in just one use 

I’m sure most of us have suffered from pesky post-Christmas breakouts – myself included – so to restore and clarify over-worked skin I recommend the Vichy Normaderm 3 in 1 Cleanser, Scrub and Mask, which clears imperfections and eliminates excess sebum. 

As it’s both a cleanser and an exfoliator, it also leaves the complexion looking brighter and more radiant, making it the ideal remedy to dull winter skin.

The moisturiser you pick is very much dependent on your skin type – if you have oily skin, the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mat Moisturiser will reduce shine and tighten pores, while keeping your complexion feeling super-soft. 

For dry skin types, the Vichy Nutrologie 1 For Dry Skin Moisturiser rehydrates the skin by replenishing its natural supply of lipids – leaving skin feeling smooth and nourished for 24 hours.

Another product to brighten up partied-out skin is the La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Serum. It immediately minimises the appearance of dark spots and dull areas on the skin, evening out skin tone for a radiant and more uniform complexion.

January is a month for R&R, and for me there’s nothing more relaxing than chilling out with a face mask to refresh and rejuvenate dull, tired skin.

One of my ultimate favourites is the Skinbreeze Hydro Mask. It’s a gel mask filled with powerful antioxidants which immediately reduce the appearance of redness and irritation on the skin, as well as smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles. 

The Hydro Mask – like the name suggests – always leaves my complexion feeling ultra-hydrated, making it the perfect January pick-me-up for the skin.

Another face mask I’m loving is the Masque Bar Brightening Sheet Mask. It helps minimise the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation on the skin for a more even complexion, and transforms skin from dull and sallow to radiant and glowing after just one use.

Finally, if overindulging at Christmas has led to any pesky spots or blemishes cropping up, the REN ClearCalm 3 Clarity Restoring Mask will help calm them down and restore clarity to your skin. Its mix of antibacterial nutrients also reduce excess oiliness and minimise scarring, leaving skin feeling and looking purified.

2015, I’m ready for you (well, at least my skin is!).
