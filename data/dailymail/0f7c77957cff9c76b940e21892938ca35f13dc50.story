TLC have one hell of a story to tell. Now for the first time their story is being told in a new VH1 film Crazy Sexy Cool: The TLC story.

The original line-up consisted of singer Tionne 'T-Boz' Watkins, rapper Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes and singer Rozonda 'Chilli' Thomas with the group's success peaking in the 1990s.

And on Tuesday night the Tionne and Rozonda reunited on the red carpet with the actresses playing them for the premiere of the film.

The all-female American
group sold 65 million records worldwide and are the second best selling
female group of all time, just behind the Spice Girls.

Best known for hits such as 'Waterfalls' and 'Creep' the group endured spats with the law, each other and the group's record label.

And despite all the awards, multi-platinum albums and sell out tours the group ended up bankrupt.

They worked with the likes of Missy Elliot, Lil' Kim and J. Cole and LIsa 'Left Eye' Lopes collaborated with former SpIce Girl Mel C on hit Never Be The Same Again, which went to number one in the UK.

Tragically
Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes died in a car accident in Honduras with the 
remaining two members continuing chart success without her.

Seven months later after Lisa's death 
T-Boz and Chilli released the group's fourth album 3D, which sold 2 
million copies worldwide.

The two remaining members of TLC went on to work with again Missy Elliot, featuring on the track Can You Hear Me which was on her 202 album Under Construction.

Scoring the Top 40 hit Girl Talk and earned two Grammy Awards nominations, it featured unreleased vocals from Left Eye.

Tionne and Rozonda seem intent on re-establishing their brand once more and on the back of this film look set to be re-signing with LA Reid, the guy who made them go bankrupt to begin with.

The legendary girl group will played The Mixtape Festival at Hersheypark Stadium, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, from July 26-27, alongside New Kids On The Block, Hanson and Boyz II Men.

Directed by Charles Stone III and written by Kate Lanier the upcoming biographical film will air on VH1 this month.
