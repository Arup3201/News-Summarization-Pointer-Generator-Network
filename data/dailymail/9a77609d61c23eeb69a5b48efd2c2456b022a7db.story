A shocking video posted online of a 'gay man being held down and punched' outside a nightclub has caused fury across the internet.

The footage was shot outside a West Hollywood nightclub and shows a man laying face down on the pavement, while one man, whop is believed to be a bouncer, shouts a homophobic remark at him as well as punching him twice.

One of the pair frequently shouts at the man to stay still, although the victim is not struggling and with his hands pulled behind his back, he is powerless to move.

Outrage: A video posted online of a 'gay man being held down and punched' outside a West Hollywood nightclub has caused fury across the internet

One of the men, who is thought to be a bouncer, appears to shout a homophobic remark at the victim - he frequently shouts at the man not to move, but the victim is quite still with his hands 
pulled behind his back

The incident, on Santa Monica Boulevard and North Edinburgh Avenue, is reported to have taken place on February 25, across the street from the famous Voyeur nightclub, a spot popular with celebrities.

Bouncers
do not have any more rights than citizens - if someone has done 
something wrong they can hold the person until the police arrive, which 
is essentially a citizen's arrest, but they can not physically assault someone, as this video appears to show.

In the short clip, the bald-headed man and another man hold down the victim while one of them accuses him of starting a fight.

'Look at my face man - they f***ed me up,'  the victim protests.

One of two men holding him down shouts: 'F**k your face. I don't give a s**t about your face.'

To which the victim replies 'Trust me please I didn't start the s**t. I was with my boyfriend. I'm a gay boy.'

At
that point the victim is punched once in the back of his head and again to the back of his head.

'Stop resisting,' one of the men says. 'Stay still motherf***er.'

A man, who is thought to be a security guard, walks up at the end, and one of the men says to him, 'Hey can we get some cuffs please'

Then one of the pair yells: 'Stop f***in' moving you c***sucker.'

Seconds later, a man, who is thought to be a security guard, walks up, and one of the men says to him, ‘Hey can we get some cuffs please.’

'Stay where you are motherf***er,' the victim is told. 'Shut up.'

One user who watched the video commented:  'Ah, the magical cry of 'stop resisting' as someone lays on the ground with their arms held﻿ tight, which allows a beating to be administered.'

Another user wrote 'It looks like private security. They are NOT skilled in detaining and cuffing someone at all. It is a disturbing video though. Language and physical hits were not necessary.'

Detective Mike Berbiar of the West Hollywood sheriff's station, told LA Weekly Blogs, the only person who was arrested at the scene was the man who was held down on the floor.

The man, identified as Timothy Reyes, is alleged to have assaulted five people inside Fubar, which is further along the street, before he was taken out and taken to the ground.

As Mr Berbiar understands it, a fight erupted over a jacket that the suspect thought was his, but apparently wasn't.

Some of those assaulted were bar staff who attempted to break up the fight, he said.

Mr Reyes was cited on suspicion of battery and public intoxication and released, the detective told the website.

The detective informed them he was not aware of the video or the bouncer's actions, but said he 'would definitely be interested in looking into it.'

The manager at Voyeur nightclub said to LA Weekly Blogs, that the bouncer was an employee of Fubar, which is down the block.
