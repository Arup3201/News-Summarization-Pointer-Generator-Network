A couple whose saucy emails went viral on Twitter have both resigned from their jobs in humiliation.

Receptionist Melanie Anderson wrote a string of graphic emails to her partner Eric Knisz about their love-life - and then accidentally forwarded them to all her workmates.

The emails, which went to 89 members of staff of the oil services firm where they both work, quickly circulated around the world with Twitter users spreading the messages via the hashtag £sandwichvan.

The couple have now both resigned from their positions over the embarrassment of the mistake.

'Mortified': Melanie Anderson exchanged saucy emails with her partner Eric Knisz while working on the desk of the oil services firm where they both work

Bruce Webster, HR director for Aberdeen firm Integrated Subsea Services, said: 'While the couple involved made a silly mistake, they did not do anything malicious or unlawful and have therefore not been disciplined.

'Regrettably they have chosen to resign.

'We are however dealing seriously with the issue of the email going out of our organisation and reinforcing our policies in relation to this.'

The receptionist sent a brief message to colleagues at Integrated Subsea Services Ltd to let them know the sandwich van was outside.

That sinking feeling: Melanie Anderson was trying to be helpful and alert everyone to the sandwich van - but revealed a lot more than she would have liked

But she accidentally wrote the message on the top of her private mail and sent them the whole email trail by mistake.

Within a few hours the email had been
 sent to other oil firms in Aberdeen and was all over social networking 
sites such as Twitter.

The receptionist began emailing her fiance at 9.48am and he replied: 'Hee hee sexy f*****, I fancy you xxx'

Eric then sent his wife-to-be another
 racy message, complimenting her about their love life: 'I love making 
love to you it's ace.'

She replied: 'Good because I totally fancy you.'

A short time later Eric states: 'I loved our s****** last night...it was ace.'

Email perils: The receptionist emailed her colleagues - but accidentally sent them all a trail of private messages

And Melanie replied: 'As I do you handsome, sexy husband.'

The emails were then accidentally sent to other colleagues at the harbour office.

ISS said the couple were 'mortified' and had apologised for any offence it caused.

The couple were not available to speak yesterday and could not be tracked down.

Eric is believed to have proposed to his girlfriend last year, and their email discussed how they would wed in 310 days.

One
 member of staff, Deborah Bowman, sent out an email after receiving it 
herself saying: 'Our receptionist is having a productive morning! Ha 
Ha...'

Melanie Anderson sent saucy emails to her partner Eric Knisz - before accidentally forwarding them on to the rest of her colleagues

And within an hour the email trail had found its way into the inboxes of other oil staff working at completely different firms and the email has become a viral sensation.

One Twitter user, known as VJ, seemed unimpressed by the content, mocking the pair for their way of expressing themselves.

She wrote: '#sandwichvan is pure gold. "I love making love to you, it's ace" - Aberdonians - rivaling the French in the language of love since 2013.'

Another Twitter user, called Kayleigh Ross, clearly enjoyed the mistake though. She Tweeted: 'Tuna Sandwich - £2.50 Bottle of coke - £1.40 Accidentally telling your entire work on how you were last night -PRICELESS #SandwichVan'

In November a New York University student inadvertently opened up a digital Pandora's Box when he hit 'reply all' to a message from the school's Bursar's Office.

Student Max Wiseltier was trying to forward the message to his mother so they could discuss how to handle a bill.

But rather than just send it to his mom, the student inadvertently sent his email to the 39,979 people on the NYU Listserv.

Mr Wiseltier's accident exposed the 40,000 students at the prestigious New York City school to all sorts of emails - including animated GIFs, crowd-sourcing questions, and desperate pleas for students to knock it off.

A top recruitment executive has been forced to quit his job - after he mistakenly sent an expletive-filled rejection email to 4,000 people.

Gary Chaplin, who earned £200,000 per year at Manchester firm Stark Brooks, received a mass-mailed enquiry from Manos Katsampoukas.

But instead of replying to just him, he accidentally replied to the 4,000 employment leads Katsampoukas had contacted in the first place.

The Sun reported that Mr Chaplin was so incensed by the email, he replied by telling the prospective employee to 'f*** off'.

He told Mr Katsampoukas: 'I think I speak for all 4000 people you have emailed when I say, "Thanks for your CV" – it's nice to know you are taking this seriously.'

Mr Chaplin added: 'Please f*** off ... you are too stupid to get a job, even in banking.' He ended it: 'Yours hitting the delete button Have a nice day!'
