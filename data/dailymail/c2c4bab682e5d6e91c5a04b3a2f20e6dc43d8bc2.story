This is the moment that a murderer calmly walked into a newsagents to buy a lottery scratchcard just 90 minutes after beating a man to death.

Stephen Gibbs, 34, was seen on CCTV chatting and laughing with the cashier as he purchased the scratchcard after attacking Rodger Tett by stamping on his head earlier that evening.

Mr Tett, 43 was attacked after he took offence at Gibbs taking cocaine during a gathering at his house in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Gibbs punched his victim to the floor, stamped on his head and then slammed it with a door. Mr Tett, a graphic designer, was rushed to hospital but later died.

Stephen Gibbs walked into the newsagents in Bournemouth to buy a lottery scratchcard just 90 minutes after beating a man to death

Last week Gibbs was found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court and was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 12 years before he is considered for parole.

During the trial, the jury was shown CCTV footage of Gibbs entering the Bournemouth shop shortly after the attack.

And speaking about the footage, Detective Sergeant Trevor Hawkins, of Dorset Police, said: 'Any normal person would have waited at the scene and faced the consequences.

After he was arrested Gibbs told the police during an interview he had been acting in self defence

'Gibbs texted his cousin, who we believe has a flat above the shop, and then went inside while he waited for a taxi.

'The CCTV showed him purchasing a scratchcard although we don’t know if he scratched it off or if it was a winner or not, and he also bought some vodka.

'It’s callous how he can just walk into a shop after doing something so horrific.

'We don’t know whether he was fully aware of the injuries he had caused, he could have been indifferent and had ‘not caring’ attitude or he could have been ignorant.'

The attack on Mr Tett, which happened on September 7 last year, was also witnessed by Gibbs’ mother Annette who was so appalled by his behviour, she gave evidence against him and Mr Tett's fiancee Kim Trevillion.

After the trial, his mother said: 'I was shouting stop, stop, please stop but he wouldn’t stop. His mind had gone.

'He was a mad man. He stomped on his (Mr Tett’s) head and it was really hard, it wasn’t my son that day.

'I could not believe what my son did and I’ll never speak to him again. He’s evil to do something like that.”

Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court: 'Rodger Tett was angry with Gibbs and demanded he leave because he didn’t want a drug dealer in his home and he didn’t want Gibbs using drugs there.

'When he was on the floor, Gibbs was punching him in the head and face. He kicked his head and stamped on him.

'Gibbs also pulled the front door on his head on at least two occasions.”

After he was arrested Gibbs told the police during an interview he had been acting in self defence.

Gibbs was sentenced to life in prison and will serve a minimum of 12 years before he is considered for parole.
