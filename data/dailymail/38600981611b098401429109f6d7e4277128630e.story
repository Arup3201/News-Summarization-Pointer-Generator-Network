Roberto Martinez spoke on the eve of this match about his squad 'embracing' the Europa League, the often-maligned competition presenting an opportunity to reboot what has been an underwhelming season.

Such European occasions were 'in the club's DNA', said the Spaniard, and they would be doing everything to triumph in the Warsaw final on May 27.

Romelu Lukaku, the £28million man who has so often embodied their travails this season, has clearly bought into his vision.

Magnificent last season, when his 15 goals in 31 league matches powered Everton's tilt at the Champions League places, Lukaku hasn't been able to scale the same heights this term.  

His goals have been fewer and further between, his form patchy on too many occasions. Put bluntly, the Belgian had not played like a club record striker. Not even close.

But here, on a freezing cold evening in the Swiss capital of Bern, he was just magnificent.

With a splendid hat-trick, plus many other important contributions, Lukaku inspired Everton to the kind of assured European away performance Martinez needs if they are to claim the second European trophy of their grand old history, 30 years after the first.

He made light of all the pre-match angst and anxiety - the plastic pitch, the in-form Swiss opposition, the injured troops who hadn't made the trip - with a performance that lifted his team-mates too.

Lukaku, of course, has a Champions League winners' medal from his Chelsea days but their 2012 triumph was not one he wished to be associated with. He had not played a minute in their winning run and didn't want to touch the trophy, feeling he had no right to.

This is a 21-year-old who wants to write his own history and, who knows, he might sooner that expected.

Wearing pristine white moulds on the artificial surface, he was alert and involved right from the first whistle, running off the defenders and generally making a nuisance of himself.

On three minutes, he directed a firm header towards the bottom corner from Bryan Oviedo's cross but goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo did very well to tip it around the post.

Everton had started brightly and didn't deserve to fall behind through Guillaume Hoarau. But Lukaku led the fightback.

His fierce effort from the edge of the box again forced Mvogo into reflex action but he wouldn't be denied a third time. Again Lukaku met an Oviedo cross from the left wing. This time it found the bottom corner, his 11th goal of the season.

Every time the ball was in his vicinity, he was demanding it, stretching out his arms before him demanding another touch. In the air, he didn't lose a duel all night.

And after Seamus Coleman had given Everton the lead, Lukaku added a third before the break. He gravitated to the back post and tapped in after Gareth Barry's low cross fizzed cross. There was an accusation of offside, but the linesman wasn't moved.

Out in the Twittersphere, Jamie Carragher joked at half-time: 'Looks like Lukaku will get that move to a big club now.' It was a form of praise for his performance from across the Mersey divide.

Early in the second-half, the striker showed his maturity by dragging Ross Barkley away from a flare-up after a late tackle. And the England man soon repaid the favour.

Spotting Lukaku's burst, Barkley placed a slide-rule pass and the striker's long legs did the rest. Scorching clear, he deftly lifted the ball past the keeper for his first hat-trick since scoring three past Manchester United for West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's last game in May 2013.

He celebrated on his knees, pointing to the heavens, knowing this was a display that would electrify his campaign at last.

Everton then threatened to self-destruct, as John Stones saw red for hauling down Hoarau in the box. Fortunately for the English guests, his penalty was high, wide and woeful.

With his team down to 10 men, Lukaku inevitably became more peripheral but the work ethic was still there. He earned an ovation from the travelling fans after haring 40 yards to chase what many strikers would deem a lost cause.

There was one blot on the copybook, a poor miscue right in front of goal after Luke Garbutt had crossed. When three goals ahead, it's far easier to forgive a miss like that.

Likewise with another one-on-one opportunity late on, which drew a flying save from Mvogo. He was replaced seconds later, earning another standing ovation. And how he deserved it after Everton's Swiss roll.
