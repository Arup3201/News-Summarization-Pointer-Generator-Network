When Henry Slade was first told by Exeter Chiefs director of rugby Rob Baxter that he had been picked at outside centre, he thought there had been a mistake on the team-sheet.

But such is his quality that on Friday night, barely three months after making the switch from fly-half to No 13, the 21-year-old will take the field against Sale ready to demonstrate once again why many believe he could yet be the long-term solution to England’s unsettled midfield.

‘We get the team emailed to us,’ Slade told Sportsmail. ‘We had a pre-season game in August and when I first saw the team I thought “what is that?” I thought it was a typo. I’d played a bit at 12 when I was younger and played full back for Plymouth Albion on loan a few years ago. But I hadn’t played 13 before.

Henry Slade was moved from fly-half to outside centre three months ago and has been a revelation

Slade has drawn comparisons with Wallaby great Matt Giteau since making the switch

‘You never know how switching positions will work out but I’ve been over the moon with the amount of game time I’ve had. I’d much rather be playing 12 or 13 than be sat on the bench.’

Put simply, Slade has been a revelation. After first catching the eye with a supremely confident performance at No 10 against Jonny Wilkinson and his Toulon galacticos last season, Slade struggled for regular game-time with the ever-reliable Gareth Steenson preferred.

But Baxter’s inspired decision to move the playmaker into the centre has led to comparisons with Wallaby great Matt Giteau and coincided with third-placed Exeter’s best start to an Aviva Premiership campaign.

‘It’s an exciting time to be at Exeter,’ Slade said. ‘We’re playing some really good rugby and winning games in different ways. We’ve really developed our game.

Many believe he could yet be the long-term solution to England’s unsettled midfield

‘The other week against Saracens we won by playing a tactical kicking game, while other games we’ve won through the strength of our attacking game. We’ve shown different ways that we can play. Personally I’ve been really pleased with how it’s gone. I couldn’t be happier in the centre.

‘Giteau is one of the best examples of a 10 playing in the midfield. He is probably a guy I try to emulate in terms of being a playmaker in the midfield.

‘Playing well against someone like Jonny Wilkinson last season gave me a lot of confidence.’

While his superb feet, smart kicking game and high-class distribution have been widely lauded, Slade’s defence has also been immaculate.

Slade takes on Fionn Carr of Connacht during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match in October

In an Aviva Premiership defeat to Leicester earlier in the season, the 92kg youngster completely nullified his hulking opposite man Manu Tuilagi. Victory in Salford tonight would move Baxter’s team to the top of the Premiership table, with Northampton and Leicester both playing tomorrow.

And another impressive show by Slade will keep his name in the frame for the Six Nations after being drafted into England’s Pennyhill Park training camp during the autumn.

The clock may be ticking on next year’s World Cup, but Slade is refusing to give up hope. ‘Of course the World Cup’s on everyone’s minds,’ he said.

‘There’s not a lot of time left now. But anything can happen. We saw during last World Cup when Stephen Donald was the fourth-choice All Black 10 going into that and ended up playing in the final. There are always surprises in World Cup year so who knows?’
