With his red ministerial box perched handily within reach of the study desk, and the uncovered keys of his piano awaiting a tune, a visitor might think that Sir Edward Heath was merely away in London, sat gloomily in the House of Commons.

The effect is perhaps exactly as the former Conservative Prime Minister intended when he stated in his will that his Arundells estate next to Salisbury Cathedral, Wiltshire should be opened to the public after he died in 2005.

After struggles to maintain the wishes of the former Tory leader - known for his grumpiness after he was deposed by Margaret Thatcher - the house has now been re-opened exactly how it was in his final days.

Sir Edward Heath's former home, Arundells, which is next to Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire has reopened to the public

Heath - a famously skilled pianist - kept photos of many of the famous leaders and figures he met during his life on his grand piano in one of the downstairs rooms

Visitors to the reopened property will, for the first time,  be able to view Heath's study, where he worked at a desk once owned by another former Prime Minister David Lloyd George

The estate first opened to the public in 2008, but the 
charity running it has since had difficulty maintaining the initially high numbers of visitors and, at one point, they even considered selling the 
property.

After Peter Batey, Sir Edward’s former Private Secretary and now a business consultant, stepped in to cover a budget deficit, the house and gardens were re-opened to the public this spring.

The house is set out exactly as the former Prime Minister, who held office from 1970 until 1974, left it when he died at the age of 89.

His Order of the Garter, a high honour he received from the Queen in 2001, is on display, alongside photos of him with some of the 20th century's most important figures.

Along with Chinese leader Chairman Mao, Cold War Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev and former US president Richard Nixon, are pictures of French President Georges Pompidou and German Chancellor Willy Brandt, raising memories of Heath's controversial decision to take Britain into the European Economic Community in 1973.

Heath requested in his will that the historic house and gardens be kept open for public viewing, a duty that is upheld by the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation

The visitors’ book contains the famous names of many of Heath's guests, including Sting, Bob Geldof, John Cleese, Des Lynam, Richard Branson and Princess Margaret.

As well as gifts given to Heath by Chairman Mao, the house features paintings by Winston Churchill, William Wyllie, John Singer Sargent, John Piper, Walter Sickert, John Nash and L S Lowry.

Champion sailor Heath - who won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1969 on his boat Morning Cloud - also brought together models of his many yachts in the house's impressive hall.

A mixture of a number of architectural eras, the house is 18th century at the front and 13th century at the back. A housekeeper’s flat and staff offices occupy much of it, with the main section including just three bedrooms.

The only other British leader to have their home open to the public is Sir Winston Churchill, whose Chartwell estate in Kent receives visitors.

Arundells is open Saturday to Wednesday until October 29.
