Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels was cheerful and without a care when he first met photographer Alfed Eisenstaedt.

In a close-up image the Third Reich politician was caught off guard smiling at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva in September 1933.

But when Goebbels found out LIFE magazine photographer Mr Eisenstaedt was Jewish his expression was quite different.

German Minister of Culture Joseph Goebbels was initially at ease around photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt in the garden of Carlton Hotel in Geneva

Goebbels, who was known for his ‘homicidal anti-Semitism', scowled at Mr Eisenstaedt and the resulting photo became famous for depicting Goebbels as the man with the 'eyes of hate’

Mr Eisenstaedt
 said: 'I found him sitting alone at a folding table on the lawn of the 
hotel. I photographed him from a distance without him being aware of it.

'Later I found him at the same table surrounded by aides and bodyguards.

'Goebbels seemed so small, while his bodyguards were huge. 

'I walked up close and photographed 
Goebbels. It was horrible.

'He looked up at me with an expression full of
 hate.

'The result, however, was a much stronger photograph.

'There is no substitute for close personal contact and involvement with a subject, no matter how unpleasant it may be.

'He
 looked at me with hateful eyes and waited for me to wither. But I 
didn’t wither.

'If I have a camera in my hand, I don’t know fear.'

This striking picture became one of Mr Eisenstaedt’s most well known images.

But he became best known for his V-J Day in Times Square photograph of a sailor kissing a random nurse in New York City to celebrate the victory over Japan on August 14 1945.
