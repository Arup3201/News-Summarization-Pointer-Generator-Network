Yours for less than £1million, an entire row of cottages ... with one very large street light.

Perched on the top of a cliff, the five properties boast south-facing gardens and sea views.

But there is one snag – you will probably need extra-thick curtains because there’s a fully-operational lighthouse and helipad on your doorstep.

Awesome view: Four of the five cottages date back to 1938 with the last built around 1970

The cottages situated on St Ann’s Head on the south west tip of Pembrokeshire in Wales used to be used as accommodation for lighthouse keepers.

But they have been empty for over a decade since the lighthouse became automated.

Consisting of four three-bedroom houses and one with two bedrooms, the whole row is on the market for £950,000. They are currently owned by Trinity House Corporation, which maintains all of the functioning lighthouses in England and Wales.

Amy Thomas, of Cardiff-based chartered surveyors Cooke and Arkwright, said: ‘This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a property in a unique and idyllic coastal location.

‘They offer a perfect opportunity for someone looking for a renovation project.’

It would be the perfect hideaway for anyone who has sung along to the song: 'I want to marry a lighthouse keeper...'

The terrace of cottages has been lying empty for a decade and they are being sold by Trinity House who run all the lighthouses in England and Wales. They have been given a list price of £950,000.

The two lighthouses on the section of coastline have been electrified since 1998.

Estate agent Amy Thomas said: 'It is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a property in a unique and idyllic coastal location.

'The cottages were previously used to house the lighthouse keepers and their families, looking after various lights along the Pembrokeshire coastline.

'The cottages have been vacant for approximately 10 years - and are in need refurbishment.

'However, they offer a perfect opportunity for someone looking for a renovation project.'

The idyllic cottages are part of a 
complex of properties at the remote spot.

Also on the site but not for sale are two lighthouses,
a helipad, a helicopter transit lounge and a former fog horn house.

The money from the sale will go to the Trinity House Corporation which has maintained lighthouses and safety for mariners since they were granted a Royal Charter in 1514.

Four of the five cottages date back to 1938 with the last built around 1970.

A lighthouse has been on the site since 1712 to warn seafarers of the dangerous jagged rocks jutting in the Irish Sea.

Miss Thomas, of Cardiff-based agents Cooke and Arkwright, said: 'Two lighthouses were were fuelled by coal fires.

Amazing sea view: The row of cottages which are also available for sale individually. They are all in a poor state of repair

Stunning: The five properties, available for less than £1m together, have some of the best coastal views in Britain but all require modernisation as they have been empty for a decade

'The existing lighthouse tower was constructed in 1844. The lighthouse was electrified in 1958 and automated in 1998.'

The lighthouse will carry on blinking away on the headland as a warning to shipping lighting up the night sky outside.

The nearest village of Dale is three miles away - but the real beauty is the panoramic views of the islands of Skomer and Skokholm with puffins, manx shearwaters and guillemots.

Four of the five homes have three bedrooms while the last one has two bedrooms. Each boasts nine-inch thick walls to withstand the battering of the sea and winds.

But Miss Thomas warned: 'The cottages have been vacant for some time and require total refurbishment. But it could be a bargain for the right person.'

Remote hideaway: The five terraced homes at St Anne's Head, are at one of the most westerly points in Wales

Run down: The properties were occupied by lighthouse keepers but the lighthouses were electrified in 1998 so they are no longer needed

Green: The cottages have stunning views and there is a helicopter pad nearby. It is thought that a developer may purchase them to renovate

Spectacular: The row of five terraced properties virtually stand alone on the remote, but beautiful, stretch of coastline

Coastal paradise: Four of the five homes have three bedrooms while the last one has two bedrooms. Each boasts nine-inch thick walls to withstand the battering of the sea and winds

Remote: Remarkable aerial image of the coastline shows just how isolated the five properties are
