An eight-year-old has become an internet sensation after his bodybuilding hero posted his picture online.

Brandon Blake, from Kildare, Ireland, has the physique of a professional athlete - despite only being at infant school. Brandon, who weighs 25kg, prefers doing chin-ups and bouncing on his trampoline than playing with toys.

'It went viral and people were talking about Brandon in Hong Kong and Australia. It was crazy.

'Brandon was just delighted he was noticed by his hero. Not that he needed it, but it's motivated him even more.

'He's a very active little boy and he doesn't do any weights. He is into gymnastics and that is where his physique comes from.

'He's developed it over the past year - it is crazy looking at him. Brandon is happy and healthy and his core strength is amazing, he is an inspiration.

'I put on a lot of weight and Brandon actually motivated me to lose it. He has been my son and my mentor.

Brandon is a fan of calisthenics - exercise which doesn't need any equipment.

The type of exercise consists of a variety of rhythmical movements - such as jumping swinging, twisting or kicking - completed without any apparatus.

The exercise increases body strength and flexibility as well as muscular and cardiovascular fitness.

Frequent users also note improved balance, coordination and agility.

Military units and sports teams are known to use the technique to help team work and group discipline.

'But he is just an ordinary little boy who loves playing with his friends. There is a small element of people who are saying it is bad, but it is not - I think it sends a positive message.'

Brandon has a healthy diet consisting of cereal in the morning, fruit throughout the day and meat and two veg of an evening.

He is not really into sweets - but will normally have some on a Friday as a treat.

He achieved his shape through calisthenics - or exercise which doesn't need any equipment.

His father added: 'Brandon is very well behaved for an eight-year-old. He's energetic, but respectful. He likes to look after his little sister Sienna, who is two.

'He is a very determined little boy. I'll come home and see he's on a chin-up bar saying he has just done 50.

'When he brings his friends around I almost trip over them as they're all doing press-ups. We have to encourage him to of and play on his Xbox.'

Andy Myers, a friend of Mark's and a personal trainer who runs AM Fitness in Kildare, often advises the boy on fitness.

He said: 'Some people will jump to a conclusion about Brandon and they will be wrong. I'm not hands on with him. It is all about living well, eating well, sleeping well and being free from stress.

'Some parents push their kids to play football, but Mark has let Brandon do his own thing.

'There is nothing excessive about what Brandon does and hopefully he will inspire others. It is completely natural and great that he has taken to it. It is to be celebrated.'
