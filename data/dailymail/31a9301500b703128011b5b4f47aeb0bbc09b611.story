Honey Boo Boo's unruly antics helped her become the break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras.

But it seems there is no stopping the mischievous ways of the six-year-old, whose real name is Alana, judging by a new trailer for her forthcoming TLC reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

The tiny tot from rural McIntyre, Georgia is seen covered in mud in one stage of the trailer after launching herself into a giant mud pit.

Big personality: Honey Boo Boo, the attention-seeking break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras, is seen getting up to even more mischief during a trailer for her new reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo

The 30-second clip shows her attempting to dance after playing in the pit, wobbling around in front of the camera in the slushy dirt.

Alana, who is almost incoherent as her speaking manner is so bizarre, is then seen yelling: 'You'd better redneck-anise!'

Her mother June, who was accused of 'doping' Alana with caffeinated drinks and high sugar snacks after appearing on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras in January, is also included in the trailer.

According to the network, the six-part series will see the family 'doing what [they] do best: four-wheeling through mud pits and picking up road kill for the family cookout.'

Centre of attention: The trailer suggests that the little girl's attention-seeking ways are far from over

Other family members shown include her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', 
12, Jessica, or 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'.

The clan are seen squishing their flabby bellies about in one particularly charming scene as they grin for the cameras.

One of the girls is seen telling the camera: 'We're not red-necks... we all have our teeth, don't we?'

A snippet from her debut on Toddlers & Tiaras is also included, which includes Alana's now famous line, 'A dollar makes me holler, Honey Boo Boo'.

The past episode of Toddlers & Tiaras saw June, who is known as the 'coupon queen', tell of how 
she created a 'Go Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant 
crack' - failed 
to boost her daughter's energy.

Beauty pageant Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Describing how 
the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.

But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She was seen telling the cameras: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.'

June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes
to the stage, she was filmed yelling encouragement and instructing 
dance moves.

When she is not
accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends 
her time collecting money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of 
household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.
