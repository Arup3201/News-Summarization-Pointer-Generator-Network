A designer has won a dispute with angry neighbours who complained about the pink door on her new fashion school.

Jacqui Burke, 50, wanted to give the building in Dunbar, East Lothian, a unique touch by painting the front door in an eye-catching colour after she moved in last September.

She chose a bright fuchsia pink to highlight her new working space - but it was a move that attracted a fierce backlash from locals who branded the new front as ‘absolutely vile’.

And the complainers told council chiefs that Ms Burke - who has dressed singers Cher and Gloria Estefan - had ‘spoiled’ the historic B-listed Castellau House, which is in a conservation area.

But, after a lengthy dispute, East Lothian Council has now told her she will not have to change the colour of her door on the building, which is the former home of the town's library.

One resident said: ‘I didn't complain to the council personally as I am all for new businesses coming into the town, but I feel they have just spoiled what was once a stunning building.

The local, who who wished to remain anonymous, added: ‘Any colour would have done apart from that disgusting bright pink - it is really an eyesore and not a good advert for the town.’

But Ms Burke said: ‘The reason we painted the door pink was because that colour is our brand identity.

‘When we moved in last year the front door was really needing done up as the paint was peeling off - but I did not expect any of this bad feeling for simply painting the entrance in a bright colour.’

Ms Burke added that a volunteer was approached by a ‘pompous’ man while she was painting the door, who was ‘very rude to her, saying that it was an absolutely vile colour’.

But she insisted there had also been a lot of support in the local community.

Ms Burke said: ‘I have had overwhelming public support from our community and beyond, and it was trending on our community website Heart of Dunbar.

‘There were over 300 positive comments ranging from how it made them smile when they passed it, it brightened up the town and how it is a lovely creative space where students of all ages can come and express their creativity.’

After speaking to the council, with planners even threatening to paint the door dark brown themselves, Ms Burke was pleased they decided to allow her to keep the colour.

She said: ‘I am so happy that we have the support of our council, and they are moving with the times, listening to what the people actually want.

‘The complaint about the pink door has actually shown me what love and support we have in our community and how people want change.

‘It is a lovely building with a history, but it deserves some new life in it so that future artists and designers can make their own history, rather than letting yet another old building stay empty and deteriorate.

‘The building is council-owned and the fashion school is on a six-month pilot, but hopefully these complaints will not affect the final decision to allow us to stay here.’

An East Lothian Council spokeswoman said: ‘East Lothian Council received a complaint about the colour of a door on a building in Dunbar which was formerly the town's library.

Jacqui Burke is from Dunbar and showcashed her designs at fashion weeks in Munich, Japan, Paris and London in the 1990s.

The mother-of-three was in a charge of a 12-man design and production company and ran her own retail outlet in Kensington,  London.

She has designed clothes for singers Cher and Gloria Estefan, as well as for Scottish electronic dance band The Shamen.

‘We have advised the business owner of this complaint but will not be asking for the colour to be changed.’

Her establishment, which is called ‘Fashion School’, offers 30-week courses in fashion design, teaching students design, pattern cutting and tailoring.

It is a social enterprise, run with volunteers and accepts people of all ages, including those struggling to find work.

Ms Burke worked as a fashion designer for a number of years, with her collections appearing on catwalks and in shops around the world, including Selfridges.
