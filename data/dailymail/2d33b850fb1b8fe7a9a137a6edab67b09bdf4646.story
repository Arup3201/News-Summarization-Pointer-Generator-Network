West Ham United supporters reacted furiously after being asked to pay a £75 deposit on their season tickets for next year.

The Hammers, who will move into the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 campaign, want supporters to pay the fee by April 17.

That has prompted annoyance from a number of fans online - although the payment will be deducted from the ticket price, which is due on May 31 in line with previous years.

Ladies' player Stacey Little took to Twitter to complain about the ticketing situation

West Ham Ladies midfielder Stacey Little was among those who took to Twitter to complain.

'I may play for West Ham but I'm also a West Ham fan who PAYS MY HARD EARNED MONEY like everyone else for my season ticket & I will have an opinion on this,' she wrote.

'Instead you have to pay a £75 NON REFUNDABLE deposit!!! Or pay it in full. Oh & the deadline date has also been brought forward again. That's what you get for being a loyal fan!!!'

Demand is high for season tickets, given it will be their last term at Upton Park.

They have increased by five per cent having been previously frozen since the club's promotion to the Premier League.

One fan said: 'So West Ham keep going on about how they are making football affordable. Yet they are putting season ticket prices up by 5%. They have a lot more demand for the last season at the Boleyn so they decide to make as much money from it as possible.'

But vice-chairman Karren Brady pointed towards the significant investment into Sam Allardyce's squad - particularly last summer.

'Since 2010, our commitment to the fans has been to restore the Club's long-term financial health, while at the same time investing substantially in improving the playing squad,' she said.

'The nine signings we made last summer have all made a big impact and we are planning significant further investment in the playing staff this summer.

'We are also improving the financial situation at the Club and are on course to meet our target of being clear of external debt by the time we move to our stunning new home on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

'After last year's price freeze across the board, I am pleased we have been able to once again freeze prices for junior supporters. For everyone else we have capped the increase to all tickets at five per cent, the equivalent of just £1.58 per game for price-band 4 or £2.37 per game for price-band 1.

'Over the past five years, the increase in the price of a renewed Season Ticket at the Boleyn Ground has tracked at approximately 40 per cent below the rate of inflation (RPI), meaning a Season Ticket still represents fantastic value for money.'

Joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold added: 'It is clear that our final year at the Boleyn Ground and our first year at the new Stadium will be two seasons that no West Ham fan will want to miss. It is in response to that demand - and the pressures of managing it - that we are beginning next season's renewals and sales process earlier than normal.

'As long-standing advocates of making football more affordable, we are pleased to confirm that we will be freezing Under-10s and Under-16s Season Ticket prices for a second consecutive year. 

'With prices starting at just £110 for Under-10s and £235 for Under-16s, we are hoping as many young Hammers as possible can be part of what is sure to be an exciting and emotional 19 games.'

Stacey Little was right to speak out. It was from the heart, with a genuine concern as a fan - not as captain of the Ladies team.

And as a season ticket holder myself, I have to say I too was very disappointed by the news, at first.

Requesting a £75 early deposit seems to be quite cheeky. It feels unfair to loyal supporters, many of whom have been attending home games for 10, 20, 30 years. The message appeared to be 'Pay up or lose your seat'.

Of course, that isn't the case at all and there is a perfect logic to all of this.

Demand for tickets has reached unprecedented levels at West Ham. Every Premier League game this season has been a sell-out so far and there are several-thousand supporters signed-up to a waiting list, hoping to get their hands on any leftover seats for next season's farewell to the Boleyn Ground. This is a more of a measure to ensure a smooth transition for the eventual move to Stratford in 2016.

And providing the team continue to play well, there'll be no further complaints from yours truly!
