A woman who lost her unborn baby girl after the fetus was cut from her womb in a brutal attack by a  stranger has been released from hospital, her family said on Wednesday.

Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven-months pregnant when she responded to a Craigslist ad for maternity clothes in Longmont, Colorado last week. She was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out allegedly by 34-year-old Dynel Lane. 

Miss Wilkins had been treated at Longmont United Hospital. In a statement, her family said: 'Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. 

'She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation.

Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she was stabbed and had her baby removed by a female attacker in Longmont, Colorado. She was released from hospital on Wednesday 

A GoFundMe account has been set up for the 26-year-old and raised close to $47,000 from well-wishers. Her family expressed their gratitude on Wednesday 

'She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. 

'Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving.

The statement continued: 'We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. 

'What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they’ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. 

The 26-year-old was surrounded by family who confirmed she had now left hospital. They said she was drawing comfort from her beloved dog, Jade, who had not left her side 

'You’ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much.'

A GoFundMe page has raised close to $47,000 for the 26-year-old. The family wrote on the fundraising page that Miss Wilkins was also being comforted by her 'beloved dog Jade'.

The 26-year-old had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes.

On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver.

She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane. 

The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub. 

Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby. 

The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed.  

Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor. 

During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' 

The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock.

'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — "Help me! Help me!"' Sawyer told KTLA this weekend. 

He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood.

'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. 

Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.'

'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself.

The 26-year-old was released from Longmont United Hospital on Wednesday. 'She is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation,' her family said

Last Friday, a member of hospital staff told Daily Mail Online how Wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby and still believed she was carrying her child.

Abby Johnson, 18, an intern at the hospital, said the horrified woman, who had blood pouring from her stomach, pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this spring.

Miss Johnson, speaking through her friend Gary Brennan, said Miss Wilkins was in 'a terrible state with her guts hanging out. She had been bleeding really badly'.

The victim's cousin told ABC11 that the baby was Miss Wilkin's first child and would have been her parents' first grandchild.

Suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault and child abuse.

She been remanded in Boulder County Jail on $2 million bail.

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, (pictured with her husband, David Ridley) was facing murder charges in Colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a Craigslist ad for baby clothes

Police were  investigating whether Lane knocked Wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen.

Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised. 

She was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open.

In Longmont this week, protesters took to the streets of the city, which has a population of 90,000, to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder. 

The demonstrator's held placards with messages such as 'Murder is murder' and 'Justice for Michelle'.

Among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media.

Katelyn Dunn, 26, said: 'We feel so sorry for Michelle. She had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother.

'It is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen. We feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less.'

Murder charges against Lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother's womb, the district attorney's office said last week.

Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett said: 'The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue.

'Under Colorado law, essentially, there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time.

'I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established, what our facts are here.'
