Dogs once owned by NFL player Michael Vick and part of his dogfighting operation now have new, happier lives.

Nicknamed 'Vicktory Dogs,' 22 of Vick's dogs were taken in by Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, The Bark Post reports.

When the animals were first taken in, they showed extreme signs of trauma, the shelter says.

'It wasn't easy. Some of these dogs would flatten themselves like pancakes to avoid being noticed by people. Some would threaten,' the sanctuary says on its website.

'But like all of the 1,700 or so homeless pets who take refuge here at the Sanctuary on any given day, they received every bit of training, veterinary care, compassion, and in-depth emotional healing that they were so desperately in need of.'

Many of the dogs have found entirely new lives. 10 of the dogs have new homes, while seven still live at the shelter, The Huffington Post reports.

Cherry was featured on the National Geographic program DogTown before getting a new family, The Bark Post reports. Now he is used for events to raise awareness about abused animals. A Facebook page, called 'Vicktory 4 Cherry,' currently has over 9,400 likes.

Like Cherry, Handsome Dan has become a celebrity. The dog is now the face of rescue shelter Handsome Dan's Rescue for Pit Bull Type Dogs - and the shelter's page currently has over 464,000 likes on Facebook.

Halle was adopted and now is part of a home that includes two other dogs. Owner Traci described her perseverance in a post on Best Friends' website.

'No dogs should ever be given up on just because of their past,' she said. 'I look at Halle and the other Vicktory dogs who are thriving in new homes, living with other dogs and even small children.'

'Through a lot of love, patience, and the right kind of training, these dogs really can overcome the past abuses they have endured and make wonderful pets and companions. I would not trade the experience of adopting Halle for anything.'

Little Red, who served as a 'bait dog' in Vick's operation, the Bark Post notes, now 'lives a life full of treats' with new owner, Susan. Meanwhile, Squeaker was taken in by a new family that own 6 other canines.

Sadly, the website notes that two of the Vicktory dogs passed away.

Georgia died in 2013 due to kidney problems. An obituary from the shelter describes her appearance on DogTown as well as appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Larry King Live.

Pups Mel and Oscar have also found loving homes, the Bark Post says.

Mel now belongs to Richard Hunter, a radio DJ who covered the Vick scandal in 2007.

Oscar reportedly belongs to a loving owner named Rachel - who told Best Friends in a 2013 post that all Oscar and the other Vicktory dogs want is love.

'These are not fighting dogs; they are dogs who were forced to fight,' she said. 'They had to fight or die.'

She added, 'Sure, they may be frightened, cautious, and slow to trust, but at the end of the day, all they want is to be loved and to love in return.'
