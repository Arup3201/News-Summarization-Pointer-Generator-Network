A Guantanamo inmate who has been held in Bay for more than 13 years has given a graphic and harrowing account of his time imprisoned by U.S. authorities.

Samir Naji, a Yemeni who was suspected of being a security guard to Osama bin Laden but never charged with a crime, wrote how he was drugged, sexually abused, beaten and trampled in the notorious prison.

Naji, who was cleared for release five years ago but has yet to be let go, said guards would work in shifts to subject him to brutal, continuous interrogations lasting three months at a time.

In a first-person account published by CNN, Naji told how he would be abused beyond the point of collapse, and prison guards would watch over him in hospital, waiting for the moment he was cleared for release so the process could start again.

The inmate - who insists on his innocence - says his prolonged torture 'achieved nothing', but brought 'shame' on the United States.

In the account, he wrote: 'I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months. Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night.

'Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming.

'There are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room. They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them.'

He  describes being injected and knocked out when it is obvious he will be of no use identifying the men.

Naji also says that he tried to go on hunger strike, but was laughed at, had food poured on him and was then force-fed intravenously.

When he eventually gave in, he said: 'I tell the interrogators that I can't face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig.

'They won't let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants.'

Naji also describes psychologically damaging routines that Guantanamo guards would act out - including showing him images of bestiality - a man having sex with a donkey - and videos of other prisoners being abused.

He added that guards shaved off his beard in what he terms 'a gratuitous insult to my religion.'

The account was prompted by the release of a lengthy CIA report on torture, which has caused outrage among lawmakers, the public and other nations.

However, Naji points out that the torture report does not cover the situation

The Obama administration has a long-held ambition to shut down Guantanamo Bay, but the process has taken longer than hoped - partly because it is difficult to find somewhere to send prisoners once they are released.

This week six former inmates were rehomed in Uruguay after being held for more than a dozen years.

The six men - four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian - were accepted by the South American country as refugees and were seen walking around the capital city of Montevideo, seemingly enjoying their freedom.
