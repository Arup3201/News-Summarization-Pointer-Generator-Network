Michael Sheen has played a lot of alpha males.

He's been David Frost in Frost/Nixon, Brian Clough in The Damned United, Tony Blair in The Deal, The Queen, and The Special Relationship.

And he's currently filming the second series of the acclaimed US drama Masters Of Sex, in which he's one of the most alpha of them all, Dr William H Masters, the driven scientist whose 1950s research into how the body responds to stimulation sparked the sexual revolution and who has been credited with 'teaching America how to love'.

In person, Michael's a man of incredible intensity too – though one who can be uproariously funny. He is fiercely focused on the things that are important to him.

It's easy to understand, then, why he had it written into his Masters Of Sex contract that he needed a week off to play football.

Not just any football. He's team captain in a televised, celebrity-studded Soccer Aid match in aid of children's charity UNICEF UK, and when he plays at Old Trafford tomorrow his childhood dreams will be reignited.

Michael, 45, grew up in Port Talbot, South Wales, the birthplace of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, which he says is a 'good breeding ground for actors, maybe because there's absolutely nothing to do'.

But his first ticket out of there was actually from Arsenal, who offered a teenage Michael a youth team place. 'Up until I was 13 I was obsessed with football,' he says, 'but going to Arsenal would have meant living in London and Dad said I was too young and I had to wait till I was 16. But by the time I was 16 I had become obsessed with acting.'

Football still excites him, though, and he's passionate about raising money for UNICEF and doing it in a way he loves.

'Old Trafford is going to be the scene of one of the greatest football matches of all time,' he smiles. Robbie Williams came up with the idea of Soccer Aid eight years ago and tomorrow he's England's assistant manager and captain, with players including actor Dominic Cooper, pop stars Olly Murs and Mark Owen, and comedian John Bishop.

Michael, who plays in defence, is captain of the Rest Of The World. 'Whenever I go anywhere in the world and talk about Soccer Aid I always say, "And I am your captain,"' he chortles quietly. 'This will be my third Soccer Aid.'

His team – coached by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho – includes Scottish actor James McAvoy, Jeremy Renner, who appeared in Avengers and American Hustle, chef Gordon Ramsay and Irish comedian Patrick Kielty. Football legends also playing include Jamie Redknapp, David Seaman and Teddy Sheringham.

Michael was born in Newport, Wales, but moved to Liverpool aged five, and then back to Port Talbot three years later with his father Meyrick, who now works as a Jack Nicholson lookalike, and mother Irene, who writes poetry. It was tough for him to suddenly find himself in a school where everyone knew each other and he was the outsider. He had to be good at football to be accepted.

'Football stopped me being picked on,' he says. But then, after the drama teacher at his comprehensive school had put him up for classes at his local youth theatre, he was set on a new path.

'Acting became something that was a great guide through life, through the world.'

It's certainly taken him all over the planet but acting isn't the reason he lives in LA. He's there because he wanted to be close to his daughter Lily, 15.

Her mother is the actress Kate Beckinsale, and though they split up in 2003, they remain devoted parents. Perhaps because he got tired of people questioning him about his ex, who's since married director Len Wiseman, Michael has become extremely private.

I ask him if anyone ever comes up to him in the street to ask him for advice, a la Dr Masters, on their sex lives? 'No, because the character is quite formidable.

Not the warmest. People are a bit worried about coming up and asking me stuff. I think I tend to scare them off.' Are he and the character similar? 'When you're playing a character for a long time, you invariably find connections. You do start to mould yourself into the person. So yes, there are a lot of similarities.'

He is, however, relaxed talking about two things – Lily and football – saying he only took a part in the Twilight saga (as vampire Aro) so his daughter could be enthusiastic about a film he'd been in.Football, though, is clearly still a pure joy, not just the playing of it, but with Soccer Aid and UNICEF.

'Last year I went to see the work they're doing in Chad in central Africa, and Lebanon, to see how the money we raised in the last Soccer Aid was being spent.' He describes seeing malnourished infants close to death being given life-saving treatment.

'You see them hours away from dying and then leaving healthy. It makes you want to do the best you can.

'I remember sitting in a UNICEF camp opposite a girl the same age as my daughter. This girl's name is Rose. Through an interpreter I said, "That's a beautiful name. I have a daughter and her name is a flower too." She told me about her life and I realised just how different Lily and Rose are. It made a very real, direct connection. I couldn't help but see my daughter in her position and vice versa.'

Michael's spent the past week training for his big match after jetting in from LA. 'Exercise and running around the training pitch is the best way of getting over jet lag. I don't do a lot of sport these days but I try to keep as fit as I can as I know how unbelievably exhausting playing a match is, and what a strain it puts on a boy in his mid-forties.

'This year it's going to be different. It's not just about fulfilling my dreams, I actually have a direct experience now of what the money that's raised can do to help people. And it's still going to be amazing to walk out in front of 70,000 people at Old Trafford – there really is no feeling like it.' nSoccer Aid, tomorrow, 6pm, ITV.
