Seven- one.

Alright, it was not the greatest surprise of all time that Germany beat Brazil, who had been surviving on the oxygen of public euphoria.

But seven-one? 

Brazil, the emergent economic nation, may not recover from this.

Devastation: A tearful David Luiz is comforted by Thiago Silva after the result that shook Brazil

Shock: The Brazil back four cannot believe it as they concede the sixth goal during a terrible display

Never mind Big Phil Scolari and his devastated football team who, in the emotion of losing their Neymar prodigy, played with their suicidal  hearts instead of their heads against the German ice-machine.

And what about our fantasies? Brazil were the beautiful dream. Brazil in Mexico 1970 were the most beautiful team.

Belo Horizonte means beautiful horizon. Yet once again this otherwise little-known city is the graveyard of football dreams.

Seven-one.

Glum: Brazil fans cannot believe their eyes as Germany record the unbelievable result against the hosts

Delight: German fans in Belo Horizonte could scarcely contain their joy as their team performed magnificently

This one was the most astonishing because of the margin. Sometimes the great upset involves two major nations in a match for which one was such a huge, in-form favourite that triumph seemed inevitable.

Here are the World Cup’s Mind-Blowing Seven: 

1) Brazil 1 Germany 7 2014 

Never mind the result. Measure the score-line in Belo Horizonte.

Hundreds of thousands of electronically shocked twitterers. Two-hundred million traumatised believers.

In tatters: Luiz Felipe Scolari gesticulates as his team are dispatched and his reputation dismantled

Eleven samba footballers, plus subs, who will never play the same again.

2) USA 1 England 0 1950

The curse of Belo Horizonte strikes for the first time,  An England team replete with famous names, who make them  World Cup favourites, rest Stanley Matthews for the serious tests to come and are knocked out  by Joe Gaetjens, whose day-job is as a dishwasher in a fast food restaurant.

3) West Germany 3, Hungary 2 1954

The
 Magyars of Ferenc Puskas, the brilliantly nick-named Galloping Major, 
had stormed Fortress Wembley with a transforming 6-3 win and thrashed 
England 7-1 in Budapest in a 32-match unbeaten run en route to the World
 Cup Final in Berne.

They
 had also crushed the Germanys 8-3 in the group stages of that 
tournament. Puskas and Czibor each scored to put Hungary two-up inside 
ten minutes.

Magical Magyars: Hungary, led by Ferenc Puskas (above) had been thrashed Germany in the group stage

Comback: Max Morlock scored Germany' first goal as they came from behind to win the trophy

4) North Korea 1 Italy 0 1966

Italy were to suffer another calamity in Southern Korea 42 years later but the Asians had not been thought of as a threat at this time  and Pak Do-Ik’s goal sent the Italians home to double the barrage of rotten tomatoes which is always their lot when they return from a World Cup disaster.

Contest: Italy turned up to the Riverside expected to ease past North Korea but the Koreans defended well

Shock: Four North Korean defenders battle with Giacinto Facchetti as Italy's high-profile side were beaten

5) Cameroon 1 Argentina 0 1990

Diego Maradona’s Argentina went to Italy as World Cup favourites only to lose the opening game of that defence to Francois Oman-Biyik’s lone goal for basically the first of the emergent Africans, who were red-carded down to nine men by the finish but held on.

Towering: Omam Biyik scores the only goal of the game as holders Argentina lose to Cameroon

Upset: Biyik celebrates the surprise goal but Argentina still managed to reach the World Cup final

Unbelievable: The Cameroon players celebrate their win, as surprised as anyone at their achievement

Still Maradona carried Argentina to a losing final against the Germans, on the Hand of God and one leg.

6) Spain 1 Holland 5 2014

Vicente del Bosque’s defending World Cup holders have escaped relatively unscathed for being slaughtered by the Dutch and eliminated within their first two matches of Brazil 2014, not least because their catasrophe has been overshadowed by Brazil 1 German 7.

Turning point: Robin van Persie's flying header put Holland level after Spain had taken the lead

High five: Louis van Gaal's side produced a stunning display to beat the World Champions

But Van Persie’s Superman header dramatically  signalled the end of Spanish supremacy, as well as football’s tiki-taka era.

7) France 0 Senegal 1 2002

La
 Belle France of Zidane, Desailly, Viera, Barthez and Petit opened the 
defence of their only World Cup – won in Paris four years earlier- by 
losing to a goal made by El Hadji Diouf for Papa Douba Diop.

Stars struck: Papa Bouba Diop scores from close range as the likes of Barthez and Petit look on

Competition: France's stars were out-fought by a team of then-unknown Senegalese players

The champions went out in the group stages.
