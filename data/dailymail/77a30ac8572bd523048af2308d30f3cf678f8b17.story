Rail staff stumbled across an unlikely item of lost property on a busy commuter train at Swansea station - a tiny pet Chihuahua dog.

The animal was discovered in a carry case by a train guard on an Arriva train from Manchester Piccadilly to Swansea last Thursday.

The terrified dog, which was said to be in good condition, was handed to the RSPCA.

The animal charity has so far failed to find the dog’s owner and is trying to establish why the elderly animal was left on a train. It said the dog had no label but was micro-chipped.

RSPCA Inspector Nic De Celis said: “There could be someone out there who is missing this dog and is frantic with worry and we’d really like to reunite them with their pet.

“But at the moment the reason why this dog was left alone on the train is a complete mystery.

“We are keen to speak to anyone who has any information, whether they noticed the dog while travelling on the train or if they know of someone who is missing a Chihuahua.”

‘In light of this, we decided to discontinue the case.’
