Having
 travelled to The Gambia every year for more than a decade on family 
holidays, nurse Victoria Ord knew what precautions to take.

Her 
vaccinations were up to date and she had packed enough high-factor 
sunscreen to protect all of her extended family during their two-week 
trip.

She also started taking daily anti-malarial medication before she left Britain to ensure she was protected.

Despite
 her medical training, however, Victoria, 37, did not know that the  
24-hour stomach bug she picked up halfway through the holiday would 
render those doxycyline tablets useless.

And the bug, although unpleasant, was not even that severe.

'I
 had my birthday during the holiday and woke up feeling sick that day so
 skipped breakfast, but took my anti-malarial as usual and had just a 
cup of tea,' says Victoria. 'About an hour later I started vomiting and 
carried on being sick for the rest of the morning.'

She was well 
enough to go out later for a birthday dinner with her husband Jay, 41, 
and ten-year-old daughter Madison, joined by the rest of the family, 
although she didn't have much of an appetite.

By the next day she was
 feeling better, but the damage had been done. Within four days of 
returning home, Victoria was in a resuscitation room in A&E, 
delirious and too weak even to stand.

She had malaria, which can be 
deadly. Just this weekend, 21-year-old British aid worker Christi Kelly 
died in Kenya after contracting the disease. She, too, had been taking 
anti-malarials.

Victoria had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes, but hadn't even noticed the bite mark

Tests revealed Victoria had falciparum malaria, the 
most severe form of the disease, and she was immediately taken to 
intensive care where she was put into an induced coma. At one point, Jay
 was warned his wife might not survive.

Victoria had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes, but hadn't even noticed the bite mark from the insect.

'Because I'd been taking my anti-malarials every day I never thought I could be at risk,' she says.

The
 problem with doxycycline and most other popular anti-malarials is that 
they have to be taken every day to keep enough levels in the blood to 
suppress malaria as it's developing, explains Dr Nick Beeching, senior 
lecturer at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

'So a period of 
sickness or diarrhoea, even over just a day or two, could leave you less
 protected - and it takes a little while afterwards for the medication 
to return to optimum levels,' he says.

And it's not just 
anti-malarials. The potency of any daily medicine, including those for 
long-standing conditions, can be affected by sickness and diarrhoea, 
says Sultan Dajani, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

'If you've 
vomited within three hours of taking medication, its effect will be 
compromised,' he says. 'And if you're on medication for cardiovascular 
or stroke-related conditions - to regulate heartbeat, control blood 
pressure or prevent blood clots, for instance - that could be life 
threatening.'

Often those on medication are unaware that they are, in effect, missing a dose if they have a stomach upset.

'People
 think that once a pill is swallowed, the effect is immediate,' says Dr 
Tony Steele, GP and medical director of the Dr Fox online clinic. 
'Vomiting or diarrhoea can effectively mean a missed dose and it can be 
critical - enough to throw some patients on medication for heart 
problems into heart failure.'

Dr Steele has known of patients on the 
blood-thinning drug Warfarin to suffer a blood clot because of a missed 
dose through an upset stomach. There are others at risk, too. For women 
taking the contraceptive ill, even a minor stomach upset can reduce  its
 effectiveness and result in  an unplanned pregnancy.

With drugs that
 have a long-lasting effect, such as thyroxine for thyroid problems or 
medication for osteoporosis, a couple of days of sickness won't cause 
too much of a problem, according to Mr Dajani.

But, he warns: 
'Losing a day's worth of epilepsy, asthmatic drugs (excluding inhalers) 
or those for mental health conditions such as schizophrenia can have 
serious consequences.' Diarrhoea can be more problematic than vomiting. 
The resulting dehydration and the effect this has on your levels of 
potassium and sodium (electrolytes that help regulate fluid levels) can 
also affect how drugs are absorbed, adds Dr Steele.

'This can, for instance make digoxin, which regulates irregular heartbeat, ineffective.'

So if you are on daily medication and have an upset stomach what should you do?

'You
 should repeat the dose as soon as possible and seek medical advice if 
you are sick again within three hours of taking the replacement dose,' 
advises Mr Dajani. 

With diarrhoea you should also keep up your 
fluids and take rehydration sachets to replace lost electrolytes. And 
make sure you discuss a sick-day management plan before you even go away
 - again, with your pharmacist or GP.

'Everyone should know what to 
do in unforeseen circumstances - if they become ill with another 
condition that may affect their medication, they lose their drugs, their
 tablets get wet or, say, they're on insulin which needs to be kept in a
 fridge, but there's a blackout at their resort,' says Mr Dajani.

Victoria
 started to become seriously ill the day after she returned home to 
Stockport, Cheshire, in November 2011. Her symptoms began during her 
first night shift back at Stepping Hill Hospital.

'I felt freezing 
cold and so achy the next morning, that I went straight to bed when I 
came home and didn't have the strength to get up again,' she explains. 
'But I thought I'd just picked up flu coming back to a cold November 
from the heat of The Gambia.'

After three days without any 
improvement, Jay, a hospital driver, had noticed Victoria's breathing 
quickening as she slept, and that her golden tan appeared to be turning 
yellow.

'He contacted our GP who said I'd already called and been 
told it was probably flu - but I was becoming delirious,' Victoria 
recalls.

'Jay told him I couldn't remember making the call and asked
 if I'd mentioned we'd just returned from Africa. The GP ordered Jay to 
get me straight to hospital.'

Jay had to support his wife down the 
stairs to their car to take her to A&E at Stepping Hill, where she 
rapidly began to deteriorate. 'Doctors were able to tell quite quickly 
from looking at my blood that it was malaria, but I didn't believe them.
 I kept telling them I had been taking the pills, that I'd been “good” 
and done what I was told,' Victoria says.

She was transferred to 
intensive care where she was put into an induced coma - she also 
developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, inflammation of the lungs
 that reduces oxygen levels in the blood, and had to be put on a 
ventilator.

She needed dialysis to help her kidneys function as they
 were failing as a result of blackwater fever, a complication of malaria
 caused by red blood cells bursting in the bloodstream as they are 
infiltrated by the malaria parasite.

She was also suffering from jaundice and cerebral malaria as the parasite caused inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain.

Treatment
 began immediately with intravenous doxycycline, an antibiotic, and 
quinine to clear the parasite from her bloodstream.

'I was brought 
round every day for doctors to be able to monitor my reactions for 
improvements. It was the scariest part because I was so disorientated.

'I
 could see balloons and bright lights and thought I was in a freight 
container being taken back to The Gambia to be married off.'

She was 
transferred to North Manchester General Hospital's infectious diseases 
and tropical medicine unit. It took another two weeks - while she 
remained in a  coma - before she started to improve.

It took three weeks before she was allowed to return home and ten months before she was well enough to return to work.

A
 recent survey for online doctor service Pharmacy2U found one in ten had
 travelled without vaccinations or malaria medication - many lured by a 
last-minute deal.

'Putting a holiday before your health is very 
foolish, not least because these diseases can be fatal and are often 
also a horrible way to die,' says Dr Beeching. 'Neither can you ignore 
minor health problems because their impact can be similarly 
devastating.'

Victoria is now all too aware of this. 'I thought I 
was doing everything I could, without ever realising the impact of a 
minor stomach bug on my good intentions.'
