Behind bars: David Simpson could face the death penalty if convicted of murder after finding 18 mutilated bodies in the Central African Republic

David Cameron has intervened in the case of the British pilot accused of mass murder in the Central African Republic.

Safari firm worker David Simpson, 24, of Pickering, North Yorkshire, discovered 13 corpses in a jungle two months ago.

He reported the finding but two days later was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been held in a squalid prison in the capital Bangui ever since.

The Prime Minister has discussed the case with one of the country's closest allies, Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba.

It is claimed President Bongo has now sent an envoy to make representations on Mr Simpson's behalf.

A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed: 'The case was raised in the meeting that the Prime Minister and [Minister for Africa] Henry Bellingham had with President Bongo during his visit to the UK last week.'

Charity Human Rights Watch believe that the supporters of notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings.

Mr Simpson, who was working for the safari firm Cawa, now faces up to six more months in jail as a judge carries out a review of the case.

Mr Simpson's family have received hate mail from animal rights campaigners saying that they hope he is ‘raped and murdered’.

The manager for a big game hunter has been been charged with mass murder - which he denies - following his gruesome discovery of the mutilated bodies of the gold mine workers.

Murder still carries the death penalty in the impoverished country, although the last execution was in 1981.

Since his arrest, anonymous letters have been sent to his family’s pheasant farm in Yorkshire, saying they hope Mr Simpson ‘rots in hell’ for his work with the game company, which offers wealthy clients the chance to shoot lions, leopard and buffalo.

One of the letters, posted by his brother Paul, 22, on a Facebook page dedicated to securing his release, reads: ‘I hope he rots in hell and then gets hacked to pieces.’

The author adds: ‘I just hope not too much of my tax money is spent on consular assistance.’

Paul said: ‘One of the letters was addressed to my mother.

‘It’s shocking because why should David’s life matter less than that of an animal?

‘I do not understand where that kind of hatred comes from. The things they were saying were just awful, that they hoped David was raped and murdered whilst in prison.’

Talks: David Cameron has raised the case of David Simpson with the Gabon president

The letters, posted from Sheffield and Lancashire, are now being investigated by police.

Mr Simpson’s family had initially hoped he would be freed within weeks, but despite meeting with the Foreign Office on Monday to try and negotiate terms for his release, they do not know how long it will be.

His father Peter has also posted on the Facebook page that they have been told he will be released under house arrest this week, although he added:

‘They have been saying this for a month now.’

Mr Simpson’s family say they are also becoming increasingly concerned at alleged corruption within the CAR, which has been widely condemned for its appalling human rights record.

Their fears have been raised after a CAR newspaper apparently reported that a witness had seen Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv taking part in the massacre.

Ugandan rebel army chief Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity including the abduction of thousands of children he has forced to be soldiers or sex slaves.

His troops have already committed hundreds of atrocities. Kony is thought to be in hiding in the CAR.

He recently made international headlines after a video of his terrible crimes went viral. It was viewed more than 90 million times and endorsed by celebrities including Angelina Jolie.

Mr Simpson moved to Africa two years ago for the chance of an exciting new life away from his rural village of Gillamoor, North Yorkshire.

He says he was helping to clear a road with some colleagues through a dense bush in the south of his firm’s vast hunting reserve on March 23 when they found the mutilated bodies of dead workers near a hand-panning gold mine.

The men had been tied together in groups of four and murdered by having boiling water poured over them, cut with machetes and beaten with sticks.

Suspects: It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings

He told the Mail: ‘It was a terrible thing to see. They were murdered in such a methodical and brutal way, tied together in groups, face down and in circles with their heads together.’

His company Cawa offers clients the chance to hunt wild game animals at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, with the cost of shooting a lion being around £20,000.

Since his arrest, his younger brother Paul, who lives with his parents, Peter, 54, and Vicky, 53, on their farm, has been campaigning for his brother’s release.

He said: ‘It is incredible that my brother is being accused of this. It is all about money.

‘We are all very worried about. I just hope the police come to their senses and release him.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is taking this case extremely seriously and has pressed the CAR authorities for assurances that due legal process will be followed. We have asked that the matter will be concluded as swiftly as possible.’
