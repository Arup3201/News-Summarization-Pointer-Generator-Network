Plus-size trendsetter Gabi Gregg has finally launched a second collection for Swimsuits For All today, filled with retro-style bikinis, tankinis, and maillot styles that come in brightly-colored prints.

The designs follow the 26-year-old writer’s inaugural design outing for the online retailer, which left fans disappointed when the collection sold out in less than 48 hours last May.

Much like her first swimsuit range, Miss Gregg’s new designs are offered in sizes 10 through 24 and hark back to the Fifties with high-waist ruched bottoms and full-coverage underwire tops. They are presently available for pre-sale and will ship after April 16.

Miss Gregg’s second batch of designs for Swimsuits For All range in price from $43.50 for a bikini, to $58.50 for a ruffled tankini. These prices reflect the 25per cent promotional discount that Swimsuits For All is currently offering site-wide.

Miss Gregg, a size 18 herself, has named the collection after her blogging alter-ego GabiFresh.

She rose to acclaim last year after posting a call to action on her blog for plus-size readers to send  photos of themselves wearing swimsuits.

Thirty-one women responded to the call, and were featured on Miss Gregg’s site in a photo gallery which she titled ‘Fatkini’.

Shortly after, Miss Gregg signed a deal with Swimsuits For All, telling fans of the collection on her site: ‘I'm super passionate about plus size women wearing great swimsuits unapologetically.

‘After all of the excitement surrounding last year's Fatkini, I thought designing a few of my own would be a wonderful way to continue the movement.’

Upon the collection’s online release last May, she told Refinery 29 of  the designs: ‘I think swimsuit shopping can be horrendous if you're going to stores that don't offer your size, but finding a stylish option that fits you well can actually make you feel great!’

Miss Gregg’s outlook on swimwear resonated so strongly with fans that the collection sold out in just hours.

Hundreds of consumers who had placed orders for the designs were left disappointed when they received notice that their orders could not be filled.

One, a shopper named Bella, commented on Miss Gregg’s Instagram account: 'I ordered mine 9am May 15th after waiting over a month for the release to get a call today that my order was cancelled because they ran out.'

Swimsuits For All is looking to avoid this disappointment with their current pre-sale of Miss Gregg’s collection – which will help the site gauge how many suits should be produced.
