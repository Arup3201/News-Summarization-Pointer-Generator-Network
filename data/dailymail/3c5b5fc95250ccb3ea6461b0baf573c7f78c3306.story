Oswald Lewis, 44, (pictured) was arrested in New York following a shootout with police after going on the run for two decades

An armed fugitive wanted for nearly two decades on cocaine trafficking charges was wounded during a shootout with deputy U.S. marshals and finally arrested.

Oswald Lewis, 44, who is also a suspect in a violent stabbing, was tracked down to an apartment in Queens, New York, on Tuesday evening.

Wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with two semi-automatic handguns, Lewis fired several rounds at the officers moments after they entered the apartment, police said.

The task force returned fire and hit him once in the hand before he surrendered, according to authorities.

Investigators say Lewis only gave himself up after running out of ammunition.

He was then taken to Jamaica Hospital in New York.

Lewis was wanted on federal and state cocaine trafficking charges in Virginia from the 1990s.

The Guyana native allegedly used a false name to evade authorities after his last arrest in North Carolina in 1995, police said.

He is expected to appear in federal court in Brooklyn later this week to face the charges. 

Neighbour Stacey Barnett said: 'I hear the suspect himself screaming, 'They're going to kill me, they're trying to kill me. Before I know it, it was over.'

Witness Dino Lysaith said 'He was like, 'Don't kill me, please don't shoot me, don't shoot me I'm from Brooklyn I'm not from here.'

No officers or marshals were injured during the exchange of gunfire.

This was the second time in less than a month that a hunt for a fugitive ended in gunfire in New York.

Charles Richard Mozdir was killed in a shootout with authorities in Greenwich Village on July 28.

He shot and wounded an NYPD officer and two deputy marshals before being killed by return fire. 

Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime.

No officers or marshals were injured during the exchange of gunfire, but Lewis was taken to hospital
