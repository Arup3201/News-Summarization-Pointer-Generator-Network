Newcastle United outcast Sylvain Marveaux has been sent out on loan to French club Guingamp for the season after being banished to train with the development squad in pre-season.

Marveaux, along with the mercurial Hatem Ben Arfa, have been marginalised by Magpies boss Alan Pardew and both of their futures appear to lie away from St James' Park.

Having joined the club from Rennes on a free transfer in 2011, Marveaux made just 57 appearances for the club over three seasons - and a mere 11 in his final year.

Neither Marveaux nor Ben Arfa were included in Newcastle's squad which travelled to New Zealand last weekend for a pre-season tour.

The Magpies have been extremely active in the transfer window so far and have recruited Jack Colback, Siem de Jong and Remy Cabella in midfield.

Their arrivals would have made the Frenchman's involvement even more sparse next season and so he has moved to Ligue 1 in search of first-team football.

Guingamp finished 16th last season.
