A French skier has captured the terrifying moment he did a 360 degree flip over the top of a police car.

Candide Thovex filmed the daredevil stunt in France using a headcam attached to his helmet.

It is thought the 30-year-old may have got into trouble with the police as after he removes his skis a siren rings out and he is stopped by a police car.

Mid air flip: A French skier has captured the moment he did a 360 degree flip over the top of a police car

Dizzy: For a few brief seconds Mr Thovex sees the world upside down mid-flight

In the video Mr Thovex and a friend are seen speeding down a mountain narrowly avoiding other skiers before buildings come into sight.

He then approaches a ledge which straddles a road below where a police car is stationary.

At a breakneck speed Mr Thovex takes a jump and turns upside down in the air.

His headcam captures the moment he flies through the air before landing safely on the other side of the ledge.

The video was posted on YouTube with the caption: "A usual skiing day for Candide in his home resort, could have ended in a better way this time! Out skiing with his friend Aziz Benkrich (red pants), we should probably tell you 'DON'T try this at home' !!"

Thovex has posted the video titled 'One of those days' on his Facebook page.
