A Saudi comedian has re-written Bob Marley's classic song No Woman, No Cry to protest the ban on women driving in the kingdom.

Alaa Wardi posted the video on YouTube on Saturday and it has already had over 7 million views.

His satirical version of the 1974 hit includes lines such as 'ovaries all safe and well, so you can make lots and lots of babies,' which is a response to Sheik Salah al-Luhaydan, a 
cleric who said women who drive risk damaging their ovaries and birthing
kids with defects.

'I’m an artist and social activist. I don’t really listen to music, but while studying in the US I heard this song by this Jamaican guy that caught my attention. I decided to do my own rendition; with lyrics relevant to my culture,' he said on the video.

Although no specific Saudi law exists banning women from driving, the female population are not issued licences.

At the weekend a group of Saudi Arabian women got behind the wheel in protest at the ban on women driving in the kingdom.

Powerful religious leaders, who exert
a far-reaching influence over the monarchy, enforce the ban warning 
that breaking it will spread 'licentiousness'.

In the run up to the protest, police warned anyone disturbing public order would be dealt with forcefully.

Ultraconservative
clerics staged protests last week against the online 
petition campaign, which was launched in September, which claims to have
more than 16,000 signatures.

The
account's website, oct26driving.org, and official English language 
YouTube account were hacked on Friday, according to activists.

Activists posted a four minute-long video on the campaign's official Arabic account that they said filmed driving campaign supporter Al Sawyan driving in Riyadh.

She wore sunglasses and her hair was covered by the traditional black headscarf worn by Saudi women, but her face was otherwise visible.

Like other female drivers defying the ban in Saudi Arabia, Al Sawyan said she has obtained a driver's license from abroad.

'I am very happy and proud that there was no reaction against me,' she said. 'There were some cars that drove by.

'They were surprised, but it was just a glance. It is fine ... They are not used to seeing women driving here.' 

Protest: Female campaigners have filmed themselves driving and uploaded the footage online

However, Al Sawyan said she was prepared for the risk of detention if caught. She said she was far enough from a police car that she was not spotted.

'I just took a small loop. I didn't drive for a long way, but it was fine. I went to the grocery store,' she said.

Her husband and family waited at home and called her nervously when she arrived at the grocery store to check on her, she said.

She drove with a local female television reporter in the car. They were both without male relatives in the vehicle.

The campaign for women to drive is a rare show of defiance in the kingdom.

The kingdom's first major driving protest came in 1995. Some 50 women who drove their cars were jailed for a day, had their passports confiscated and lost their jobs.

In June 2011, about 40 women got behind the wheel in several cities in a protest sparked when a woman was arrested after posting a video of herself driving.
