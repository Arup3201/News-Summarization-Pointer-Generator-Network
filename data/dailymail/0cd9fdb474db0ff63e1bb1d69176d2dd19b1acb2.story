Owners of overweight pets are ‘killing their pets with kindness’ by overfeeding them, according to a leading vet.

Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, was 
responding to an academic report that claimed feeding pets smaller 
amounts could make them anxious and unhappy.

American vet Dr Franklin McMillan argues in the US Journal of Veterinary
Behavior that animals have ‘emotional’ eating habits linked to comfort 
and happiness, and that overeating is a result of turmoil or distress.

But Mr Hargreaves, who runs a practice in Colne, Lancashire, said that was a ‘dangerous version of the truth’.

Warning: Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, said it is not cruel to limit food intake

Mr Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the new study encourages pet owners to feel bad about reducing their animal’s portion sizes.

He said: ‘Too many people are killing their pets with kindness by overfeeding them.

‘And pet owners will do anything but decrease their animal’s food intake because they think it would be cruel.

‘The advice that anxiety can be caused by feeding animals less may be true in part in some cases.

'But as a vet who encounters overweight animals every day, a report that doesn’t openly discourage overfeeding is worrying.’

The research by Dr Franklin McMillan, a vet and former clinical professor of medicine at the Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine, in California, argues that overeating is a result of emotional turmoil or distress in an animal.

The study in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior said that animals have ‘emotional’ eating habits that are linked to their feelings of comfort and happiness.

Dr McMillan based his argument on the eating habits of pets, laboratory animals and humans.

A growing crisis: Pet slimming shows are now popping up all over the country as animals struggle with obesity

More than a third of dogs (2.9million) are overweight or obese while 25 per cent of cats (3 million) suffer the same problem, according to figures from the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals, PDSA.

Mr Hargreaves, who runs a practise in practice in Colne, Lancashire, said focusing on the pop psychology behind why pets are eating more and getting fatter will not solve the health problems that overweight animals suffer.

‘Feeding too much and exercising too little is the reason for pets becoming obese and unhealthy in the majority of cases.

Common: Many pet owners in the UK and America believe their pets need more food if they are feeling anxious

‘I find that pet owners are looking for any reason not to feed their animals less because they think it’s unfair or cruel on the creature.

‘I don’t want the message that “Cutting down your pets’ food makes them miserable and you a bad owner” to be taken too literally.’

Overweight pets have a lower life expectancy than healthy pets and often develop heart problems and arthritis.

But despite the evidence around weight-related health problems, 90 per cent of dog owners admit to feeding their pets treats such as cakes, biscuits and takeaways.
