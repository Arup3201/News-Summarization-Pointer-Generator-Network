Tens of thousands of pounds have already been bet on what the royal baby will be called, barely a day after the news was first announced.

And clever marketing will ensure firms will make the most of the royal couple's happy announcement over the next nine months and beyond.

Less than 24 hours after Kate and William were forced to confirm that she was expecting their first child after she was taken into hospital with severe morning sickness, shrewd souvenir companies had kick-started the kilns ready for a batch of commemorative keepsakes.

The name Elizabeth is already the favourite for the couple's new arrival at Ladbrokes where odds have dropped to 7/1

High-end pottery company Emma Bridgewater, which hand-makes all its products at its Victorian factory in Stoke-on-Trent, has yet to confirm a release date for the items out of respect for the royal couple.

But the manufacturer confirmed that sample products had already been drawn up and the first batch was heading for the ovens.

Designed by managing director Emma Bridgewater and her husband, Matthew Rice, the half-pint mug bears red and blue hearts in the firm’s signature sponged technique.

Finished with the words 'A Royal Baby in 2013' on one side and 'Hooray for Will & Kate' on the other, the commemorative pieces will cost £19.95.

And Dragons of Walton Street, the high end nursery outfitters based in Knightsbridge, say they have already received a peak in interest in their four-poster 'Duchess cot', since the news was announced yesterday afternoon.

The company is already a royal favourite. Diana was said to be a 'huge fan' and they designed the nursery of Prince William and Harry in a pale blue Beatrix Potter design, while princesses Beatrice and Eugenie also had Dragons' dens - in pale pink gingham and Flower Fairies.

But at £12,000 and taking an eight strong team 12 weeks to make, the cot is not perhaps as affordable as the raft of other memorabilia which will no doubt soon hit shelves and the internet.

On the other end of the spectrum Italian craftsmen in the city of Naples, who are more commonly associated with Nativity scenes, are already stocking carved figurines of a pregnant Duchess of Cambridge.

The gaudy figures feature Wills and Kate in their wedding clothes - but Kate is also sporting a heavily swollen stomach under her white dress.

Twitter quickly exploded in response to the news of the baby yesterday.

'I may not have bones yet, but I'm already more important than everyone reading this,' was the Tweet from @RoyalFetus, which already has nearly 9,000 followers.

The surprise announcement yesterday 
beat the bookies odds by one month, and now it is bets on the new arrival's name
that are hotting up.

Bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrookes say tens of thousands of pounds have been staked on what the baby's name will be - with Elizabeth a clear favourite at 7/1.

Paddy Power has said the name Victoria is currently the favourite with odds at 9/1. But other strong family names, 
including Alexandra, Victoria and
Diana are also being offered.

Jessica Bridge of Ladbrookes said: 'It's still very early days at the moment but by Christmas Day we reckon we'll have taken £25,000 worth of bets on baby names alone. '

Contenders: Elizabeth and John are strong baby name contenders - but other favourites are Diana and Charles, after the prince's parents

The firm have also been inundated with requests on the chances of the couple conceiving twins, having previously been a 33/1 shot it is now just 10/1 that Kate and Wills hear the pitter patter of two sets tiny of feet next year.

Miss Bridge added: 'The odds are now suggesting the nation should expect two new arrivals, giving us all a reason for a double celebration.'

As speculation mounted last week one gambler who believed the couple would be expecting sooner rather than later placed a £10 bet on Rylan to be the chosen name at odds of 1000/1.

Speculation as to what they might name their first child began even before Kate was pregnant with predictions posted ranging from Mary and Matilda to Edmund and George on the mumsnet website before their wedding.

Bookmaker William Hill said it will pay out a 'small five-figure sum' after many people betted on a 2013 royal baby.

Spokesman Joe Crilly said: 'We fully 
expect that the betting public will get involved in speculating what the
baby will be called.

'When William and Catherine got 
married we were bowled over by a million pounds worth of bets and we 
predict similar levels of excitement before the birth of their first 
child.'

William Hill is even offering odds on the colour of the newborn's hair - 6/4 brown, 2/1 blonde, 5/2 black, and 8/1 ginger.

Linda Rosenkrantz and Pamela Redmond Satran, the authors of Cool Names for Babies, already have their predictions on the babyzone website - posted before Kate was even pregnant.

Suggestions include Alice (the name of Queen Victoria's second daughter and also the Duke of Edinburgh's mother), Amelia (George II's second daughter), Dorothea (meaning gift of god) and Charlotte (wife of George III) for a girl and Augustus (George II's middle name), Frederick (a son of George III) or Leopold (a son of Queen Victoria).

If the baby is boy, he would be expected to be styled a Prince and if the baby was a girl, a Princess.

The last example of a great granddaughter of a still serving Sovereign born on the male line was Princess Mary, who was born in 1897 and was George VI's sister and a great granddaughter of Queen Victoria.

William uses the surname 'Wales' professionally in the forces

According to the monarchy's official 
website: 'For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are 
entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a
surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon
marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.'

In 1917, George V adopted Windsor as the royal family's House and 
surname. In 1960, for the direct descendants of the Queen and the Duke 
of Edinburgh, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince/Princess, or female descendants who marry, it became Mountbatten-Windsor.

Mountbatten was the surname Greek-born Prince Philip assumed when he 
became naturalised in 1947.

William has used Wales professionally in the forces. His children might 
use Cambridge in the same way, or even Wales too as William still 
retains his title Prince William of Wales.

If a boy, the baby is also likely to one day be Prince of Wales. The 
title is usually given to the male heir to the throne, but it is not 
automatic.
