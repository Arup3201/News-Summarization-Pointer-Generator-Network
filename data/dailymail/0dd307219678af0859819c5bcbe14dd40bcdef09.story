The group were travelling to a Murrumbidgee River campsite when the truck rolled several times before resting upside down in metre-deep water in an irrigation drain, reported The Daily Telegraph.  

The other 18-year-old passenger, who was in the vehicle's tray, was thrown from the ute when the accident happened, and was flown to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital.
