A former chef's identity was stolen by an online troll who used Facebook to con people into believing his best friend, who was recovering from an illness, had died.

Derek Evans, 57, from Cowbridge in south Wales, was shocked to discover he had posted news of his friend Leighton John's death on the site - especially because he had never gone online in his life.

The friends were on the Greek island of Zante on a two-week holiday when the message was posted, devastating family members. 

Leighton's daughter Keely Jones, 30, was reduced to a 'sobbing wreck' when she learned her father, who suffers a crippling stomach ulcer condition, was dead. 

Dozens of friends paid their respects online and called his family before it was revealed to be fake.

Best friends Derek Evans, left, and Leighton John, right, were on holiday when a troll posted a message on Facebook in Mr Evans name saying his friend had died

Mr Evans and Mr John, 64, who is nicknamed 'Bones,' have never owned a computer, set up an e-mail account or even set up landlines in their homes.

Despite this, when a page was created in Mr Evans's name, accompanied by a recent photograph, claiming his friend had 'sadly passed away', nobody suspected it was false.

The troll claiming to be Derek joined the Cowbridge Hub, a group highlighting the town's attractions, to ensure hundreds of people saw the message. 

And the identity thief took down the post before police were able to examine it.

The troll also used a recent picture of Mr Evans, from Cowbridge, as a profile picture to convince friends

Mr Evans said: 'I've never owned a computer or got a Facebook page. I've never even been online, and I definitely never will be now. This is character assassination.

'I've got no idea where this person got the picture of me from and how or why they're doing this. But it's not the first time.'

Last year, the same con was used to make it appear Mr Evans wished the death of a local soldier who had just been posted to Afghanistan. 

Mr Evans said the troll's attack, which has happened before,  is 'character assassination' 

'Somebody came up to me in Tesco's, prodded me in the back in outrage and demanded to know what right I had to say such a thing,' he said.

'I'd no idea what they were talking about and, quite understandably, it took a while to calm the person down. 

'I reported it to the police then, but nobody was ever caught. Now the person is back and they seem intent on causing as much pain and misery as possible.'

Mr John added the attack was 'totally disgusting'.

'Keely was absolutely hysterical thinking I was dead,' he said.

'A sobbing wreck. I've not heard her cry like that since she was a little girl. This was totally disgusting.' 

He added: 'That holiday was meant to be a pick-me-up. I'd been in and out of hospital since Christmas and had lost 4st. All this put the damper on things.

'The fact I'd been so ill and it appeared like Derek was making some announcement, after we'd gone to Greece, made it seem all the more likely.'

He said family eventually tracked down a mobile phone number and called to speak with Derek, and the truth came out. 

A police spokesman said the case was being investigated.

'The Facebook account has been closed down, however, if any further posts appear we have advised that a screen shot be taken to help enable us identify who has set up this account in Mr Evans name,' he said.
