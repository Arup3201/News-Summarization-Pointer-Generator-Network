Molhem Barakat, 17, was killed while taking photographs of rebel fighters and regime forces as they battled over a hospital in Aleppo

A teenage photographer whose images of war-torn Syria were circulated around the world has been killed while covering a conflict at a hospital.

Molhem Barakat died on Friday as he took photographs of rebel fighters and Government forces battling over the Kindi Hospital in Aleppo, which had allegedly been turned into a regime barracks.

The 17-year-old, who worked for news agency Reuters on a freelance basis, took dozens of photographs capturing the city's unrelenting violence.

His portfolio is equally weighted with images depicting civilian life in the divided city.

The teenager had been sending images to Reuters since May, with many of his photographs being published around the world.

According
 to his Facebook profile, Molhem was originally from Istanbul but went 
to school in the city before starting work as a freelance photographer.

Social media has been inundated with tributes praising the aspiring photographer's bravery.

Many, written in Arabic, bless the teen whose work is described as 'inspiring'.

Journalists
 from around the world have expressed shock and sadness at the news, 
with thousands retweeting Reuters' announcement of the youngster's 
death.

The conflict 
raged on in the country's largest city today as Syrian aircraft shelled 
residential areas with explosives-filled barrels, killing dozens of 
people.

The raid, which
 is widely condemned as unlawful, was particularly deadly in three 
opposition districts where at least 44 were killed including six 
children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 

Hundreds of people have been killed in
 the past week as regime aircraft dropped TNT-filled barrels on the 
country's one-time commercial hub.

The
 Observatory claimed those in Hanano, Ahmadiyeh and Haydariyeh were 
worse affected with the death toll expected to rise further.

Director, Rami Abdel Rahman, said 
President Bashar al-Assad's regime 'is trying to turn people in 
opposition areas against the rebels.

'It is killing and forcing people to flee in order to secure that goal'.

Among targets were two schools in rebel-held areas of the city. 

Aleppo's opposition Provincial Council 
said schools would be closed for a week as a result of the 'systematic, 
deliberate bombing' at hand.

Elsewhere, a car bombing in the 
Shiite village of Omm al-Amd in the central province of Homs claimed the
 lives of eight people including six children, state media reported.
