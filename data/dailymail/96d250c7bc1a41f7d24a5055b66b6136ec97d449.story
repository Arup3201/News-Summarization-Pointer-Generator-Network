Residents of a tiny Lancashire village fear their community is being wiped off the map because Royal Mail doesn't believe it exists.

Loveclough in the Pennines is renowned as a beauty spot where visitors and tourists can go trout fishing and bird watching.

But the people who live there have to use the name of a neighbouring village a mile away as their address because Loveclough is not recognised by Royal Mail.

Now locals are campaigning to get their home formally recognised with its own mailing address to end 20 years in the postcode wilderness. 

The 950 inhabitants of the village of Loveclough in Lancashire  are raising a petition to demand official recognition from Royal Mail

Residents fear Loveclough is losing its identity with many visitors unsure whether it is one word or two

Since 1993 letters and parcels destined for Loveclough have been routinely addressed to the larger neighbouring village of Crawshawbooth a mile down the road and the smaller village’s name has vanished from signposts.

Although local postal workers have always made sure mail arrives at the correct addresses, villagers fear Loveclough is losing its identity - with many visitors even unsure whether it is one word or two.

Now the 950 inhabitants of the village which has two social clubs and a pub called The Glory are raising a petition to demand official recognition from the newly-privatised organisation.

Chairman of the Lime Valley Resident’s Association, Derrick Bartlett-Smith, 62, said: 'Loveclough is a beautiful area with so much to offer.

'It is really important to us to preserve it and to do that it needs its name back. My children have all grown up here and many of them still live here and they love it.

'The way we look at it is that we are here to guard the past to protect the future. We have lost far too much of our identity at the moment. To quote Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner, "we are a name, not a number".'

The village is etched with a rich history and vast natural delights and once part of the Rossendale forest. Loveclough is also reputedly home to a Quaker burial site.

Also a hotspot for wildlife, Loveclough has 178 footpaths in the area with many hikers passing through.

The Calico Printer’s Association founded in 1899 was based in the village and represented 46 textile companies and 13 textile merchants.

Mystery surrounds the ‘disappearance’ of the village on all mail and locals initially tolerated the postcode problem until at this year’s local elections when one noted his voting registration form incorrectly stated he lived in Crawshawbooth and urged the LVRA to act.

Now the petition will be doing the rounds at their summer Fete in August with the hope of getting enough support to provide reason for the Royal Mail to change the name.

Mr Bartlett-Smith added: 'I am not sure how the village lost its name but it started about 20 years ago with the Royal Mail.

'Somehow we lost our name and were included in Crawshawbooth. I just think we got lost on the system and people started to realise their addresses had changed.

'Then some years later the street signs that said "Loveclough" were replaced and for some reason the word was not on them.

'No one knew we were here - yet obviously all of us from here did - and now it is about time we took on the plight and put things right.

'I have lived here for more than 20 years and my wife was born and bred here. Apparently it is not the Electoral Commission that does the addresses but the Royal Mail.'

'The Royal Mail said if we get enough signatures and there are no major objections they would change it.

The village has two social clubs and a pub called The Glory but it doesn't have its own postcode

'The petition was only launched this week and we have 47 signatures at this point but we are expecting more to come forward.'

'Loveclough has so much of its own history. It is the old pack horse route that people used to travel through. We also have one of the oldest buildings which used to be the Calico Printer’s Association, which is a very old association.

'It was built in 1761 originally as a manor house. It is now a social club. The villagers of Loveclough are such sociable people.

'You can go into that pub on any given day and there will be a person there who lives in one of the back to back houses in Loveclough sitting, drinking with a millionaire.'

'People may think we are being pedantic but we need to protect village life. I suppose it is the same as saying "are you British or are you English?" We want to know who we are and where we have come from and be proud of our area.'

'We are so lucky to be so close to everything. We have one of the main bus routes into Manchester called the "Witchy Way".'

'Loveclough is just near enough the city but also remote, quiet and beautiful. Everyone now these days is moving from place to place.

'From people emigrating and immigrating, to movement within this country. At the same time it is important to know exactly where you have come from.'

'We have nothing against Crawshawbooth - we work very well together as neighbours. But we are both Lancashire villages that have our own identity and we need our name back to celebrate that.'

A spokesman for the Royal Mail said: 'If we receive a request to change the name of a locality, it will be investigated by our Major Address Change team to make sure there are no operational objections to the proposal.

'We will then require letters of support from the customer representatives, identified in our code practice. Once this has been received, we will then be able to arrange to carry out a consultation of all residents, to run for three weeks.

'Provided there are no more than 20 per cent of those we consult who object to the proposal, we can then amend the addresses on our postal address file.'
