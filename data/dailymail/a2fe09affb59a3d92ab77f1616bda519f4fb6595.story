Dr Carl Djerassi, the chemist who developed the birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday

Girls today take it for granted. A rite of passage into adulthood, a hygienic routine, almost a human right. 

For the great majority, the modern low-dose oral contraceptive arouses little wonder, creates no health anxieties and raises no eyebrows (unless the taker is scandalously far below the age of consent).

The Catholic Church still forbids it and some stay faithful to that rule, but as one Irish friend observed ironically: 'It's astonishing how often the Good Lord sends us Catholic families just two babies.'

The Pill, in short, is no longer a marvel.

Indeed, any young woman who watches Call The Midwife, the BBC TV drama set in the Fifties, will, at some point, ask: 'Why on earth do these women living in hovels with hordes of small children keep having more babies?' To modern eyes, pregnancy is a simple choice.

Few women who take the Pill, until reports of his death last Friday at the age of 91, would have known that this can largely be credited to one man, the chemist Carl Djerassi.

He arrived in the U.S. as a penniless refugee from Nazi-occupied Vienna, and was himself a virgin when he married at 19. In later years, after his invention, he reflected that — without meaning to — he had sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution: not to mention a financial splash as his pharmaceutical company broke records on Wall Street.

This major breakthrough in human development, as so often happens, was an accident. In 1951, he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen — mimicking the female sex hormone known as 'nature's contraceptive' and so preventing ovulation. No egg released, no pregnancy.

The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure (I knew one woman who nearly died). Gradually, synthetic oestrogen was added and refinements produced the low-dose combined pills of today.

It was in 1960 that Britain got the Pill: it was hailed as a breakthrough, not for general sexual liberation but for domestic and family harmony. Pregnancies now could be spaced out and planned for.

The old latex contraceptive barriers could be discarded with relief, though a few women mistrusted chemicals and stayed with the good old diaphragm.

Initially, the Pill was used only by married women. It wasn't until 1964 that clinics and doctors agreed to prescribe it for single women and young girls. And even a few years later, when I got my first prescription, the family planning clinic was an ordeal.

Although some of my 1968 college intake boasted that their mums had 'put them' on the Pill, outside that Chelsea bubble, the truth is that the Swinging Sixties didn't really get going until well into the Seventies.

So in a small-town clinic you were still questioned closely about the seriousness of your relationship (it was assumed you had just one) and offered embarrassing advice by a stern nurse.

I had one memorably excruciating moment: I disgraced myself in the clinic by clumsily dropping the instructional plastic model of the reproductive system and having to crawl under a table to find a lost fallopian tube.

T he next day, after taking my first Pill, I went in to work at the local radio station and my first job was to interview a family planning nurse. The same nurse. We avoided one another's eyes.

Djerassi came to understand that he was partly responsible for a sexual revolution: in his book This Man's Pill, he said that the invention made him more interested in how science affects society. Though, he said: 'The explosion was much faster than anyone expected.'

Interestingly, he was fiercely opposed by feminists including Germaine Greer.

He recalled some 'unusually bitter exchanges' with her and accepted that some women thought he was to be distrusted as a patriarchal male scientist who was poisoning women with chemicals so men could have their way with them.

As for the idea of a male Pill, he memorably said: 'Scientifically, we solved that a number of years ago. But . . . would you, as a woman, put your entire reproductive risk in the trust that he has remembered his Pill?' Good point. And it is the social, psychological consequences we have to reflect on now.

Whenever science puts a new tool into the hands of humans — whether it's dynamite, gunpowder, the internet or the Pill — there will be both good and bad ways we use it. The huge benefits of protection from unexpected, unwanted pregnancy are obvious, not only for the young and single.

We have lost the stigma of illegitimacy — and good riddance, I am just old enough to remember the era of shame — but even now a missed period can produce heart-shaking horror. A career, a life-plan, a relationship melt before your eyes: the idea of termination is instinctively abhorrent to many, but there is real misery in feeling your body being hijacked, taken over by an uncontrollable alien process you weren't braced for.

Before the Pill, remember, that often happened — even to the most instinctively 'moral' girls. We all make mistakes. (Incidentally, Djerassi himself ruefully admitted of his second marriage: 'I, the person who synthesised the first Pill, married another woman because I got her pregnant.' He later had a vasectomy.)

But it also became clear that men would take it for granted that women were using the Pill. By the mid-Seventies, the assumption was growing that if a woman wasn't 'fixed up', there was something weird about her.

Previously, the risk of pregnancy had at least made it easier for an unwilling girl, even a girl in love, to say 'no' to full sex. It offered a breather, a chance to slow down courtship (what a forgotten word that is) and ask, as in The Shirelles song: 'Is this a lasting treasure, or just a moment's pleasure?'

The pressure to 'do it' anyway grew as the Pill became a norm.

I remember being indignantly told it was 'selfish' not to give in to a particular lad, as if women's bodies were a natural resource it was mean to hoard.

That's human nature.

It is daft to overstate the 'damage to moral fabric' argument. Djerassi himself admitted that the sexual revolution — the separation of sex-for-babies and sex-for-fun — began before his discovery, and would probably have rolled on anyway, though more slowly.

But there is no point denying he speeded it up.

A nd that alongside the joy and ease and intimacy and happiness of liberated sex, there has been anxiety and unease and a nasty notion — now at least challenged by young feminists — that women's bodies are a commodity for men's convenience, and that sex, that most marvellous of connections, need not involve any intimacy or trust or faith on either side.

The Pill has had one other effect, which no one thought about much at the time, but which now ticks like a time-bomb in the heart of every bright professional woman.

The phrase 'family planning' and the rarity of surprise-babies nowadays has deceived too many of us into taking it literally.

Djerassi predicted a future when his own invention would become redundant, with men and women doing away with the need for contraception altogether by being sterilised — withdrawing their frozen eggs and sperm from a 'bank' when they were ready to have a child via IVF.

Already it is easy to assume that we can put off babies until our 40s, or even 50s, and trust science to give nature a hand. But it doesn't always work. The fact is, the ferocious, uncontrollable, youthful fertility which once bred panic does fade, over long years of contraception. And sometimes, it gets too late to have a baby.

But these issues aside, may Carl Djerassi rest in peace. On balance, he gave a great thing to womankind and fearless happiness to millions of honest lovers.

As with all inventions, it's up to us to use it wisely.
