The usual Ladies' Day parade of extravagant headgear was replaced by a canopy of umbrellas at Royal Ascot yesterday – and even the Queen had to take cover.

Despite his wife being forced to put up an umbrella on their open-top carriage journey to the racecourse, the Duke of Edinburgh refused to let the weather dampen his spirits, continuing to smile and wave at onlookers.

As always, the Queen was ready for any eventuality, with her colour co-ordinated umbrella perfectly setting off her mint green Stuart Parvin coat and Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat.

However, less well-prepared visitors 
to the race meet quickly learned that even the most substantial hats 
offered little shelter as they struggled to escape the downpours.

Racegoers at Ladies' Day said the 
'awful' weather was a 'real disappointment' – with some women swapping 
their high heels for wellington boots by the afternoon.

And forecasters warned that there was little let-up in sight, with the wet weather set to stick around for Wimbledon.

Although there will be a sunny start 
to the first day's play on Monday, the rainy weather is likely to 
persist through both weeks of the annual tennis tournament. A spokesman 
for the Met Office said tennis fans could expect 'periods of cooler and 
wetter weather' with rain frequently putting a stop to play.

England and Wales are on course for the wettest and least sunny June since records began more than 230 years ago.

There are now nine flood alerts in 
place across the UK – most in the South West –  and the figure could 
soon rise as the heavy rain continues.

To add to the misery, 50mph winds are
set to blow in from the Atlantic at the weekend. Temperatures, 
forecasters say, could struggle to reach more than 15C.

Independent forecasters MeteoGroup today predicted as many as 100mm of rain - two months' worth - could fall on higher ground in northern England and southern Scotland in the 48 hours to Saturday morning, with up to 60mm on lower ground.

Met Office forecasts showed that 45mph gale-force gusts blowing today are expected to increase to 55mph on the south coast tomorrow and forecasters at Netweather warned of falling branches and even trees, with rough seas expected to buffet cross-Channel ferries.

The Met Office forecast a fourth wet weekend on the spin, warning of 'showers and longer periods of rain will affect many places,' with blustery winds as well.

MeteoGroup told anyone going outside to 'take a brolly,' forecasting showers followed by a band of rain on Saturday and a washout on Sunday in the North and south coast, with the Midlands overcast.

Temperatures will struggle to 16C for most of England and 14C in Scotland, with the South East warmer at 18C.

The previous three weekends this month saw the Diamond Jubilee Thames pageant deluge, 5ft deep floods in Wales and last weekend's gales and downpours.

Hundreds of thousands of music 
festival fans are set to battle mud at the weekend, with 100,000 
expected at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend to see Leona Lewis and Jay-Z 
later.

Another 90,000 
people are heading to the Isle of Wight Festival, where Bruce 
Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are playing.

The Met Office said as much as 80mm of rain would fall in many parts of the North West, north Wales and Scotland tomorrow and Saturday, with a risk of up to 100mm - more than two months' rain - in places.

A spokesman said: 'The heaviest and most persistent rain is expected to affect southern Scotland, north Wales, Greater Manchester and Lancashire regions through Friday and Saturday.

'50mm is expected widely and there is a small risk of seeing up to 100mm in some places.'

The Met Office spokesman added: 'The public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding.'
