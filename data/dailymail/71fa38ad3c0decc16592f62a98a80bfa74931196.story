Plans to clamp down on the promotion of junk food in supermarkets have been scrapped after major stores refused to sign up.

Under the scheme, so-called ‘guilt lanes’ – where sweets and chocolates are prominently displayed next to checkouts – would have been banned.

But the retailers have effectively killed off the Government’s ‘Responsibility Deal’ to tackle rising obesity levels by refusing to sign up.

Retailers have refused to sign up to the Government's 'Responsibilty Deal' to remove prominently displayed sweets and chocolate from checkouts, to help tackle obesity levels

Health campaigners last night accused the supermarkets of putting profit before their customers’ health, and said ministers should introduce laws on junk food rather than relying on voluntary schemes.

As well as action on guilt lanes, under the plan there would have been a ban  on promoting sugary drinks and snacks in high-profile positions on the end  of shelves after a Government-backed study found this led to a surge in sales.

The supermarkets have also rejected the idea of setting up a scheme that would have given customers rewards for buying healthy food such as fruit and vegetables.

The collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the Government’s efforts to tackle rising obesity and associated  ill-health, which is costing the NHS £5billion a year to treat.

The Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, is so concerned about unhealthy food that she has  suggested it may be necessary to impose sugar tax to curb consumption.

And it will raise further questions over the influence that supermarkets and other food giants are able to exert on government policy.

The Daily Mail revealed in February how the food industry lobby had been given unprecedented access to the heart of Government.

Supermarkets, fast food chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have  had dozens of meetings with ministers since the 2010 election, while health  campaigners had been kept at arms length.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said the collapse of the scheme was evidence that voluntary deals with the retail industry would not work.

He said: ‘Pester power at the checkouts, where children demand sweets and chocolates, is enormously powerful.

‘The fact that the supermarkets refuse to tackle this is a disaster.

‘The Government has been told by many people that voluntary deals do not work and here is the proof.

The collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the Government's efforts to tackle rising obesity levels and associated ill-health which is costing the NHS £2.5billion a year to treat

'The reality is that money comes first and health second.’

She added: ‘It is time for the Government to take a firm line. Obesity is a totally preventable problem.

‘If the supermarkets lose a little money for public good that is something they should be able to shoulder.’

It was hoped the public health Responsibility Deal would have seen all  the major supermarkets promise to  voluntarily ban junk food – high in fat, salt and sugar – from ‘guilt lanes’ and prominent positions at the end of aisles.

Retailers would also have agreed that more than 30 per cent of food promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free, would be skewed towards healthy products such as fruit and vegetables.

There would also have been a ban on the use of popular children’s characters, such as movie superheroes or pop stars, to promote unhealthy food and fizzy drinks.

However, trade magazine The Grocer said the supermarkets had refused to sign up to the wide-ranging measures as they ‘had failed to reach a consensus and claimed a voluntary pledge would not work on such a commercially sensitive issue’.

The Department of Health has  conceded that it will have to leave it up to individual retailers as to whether they want to stop promoting junk food.
