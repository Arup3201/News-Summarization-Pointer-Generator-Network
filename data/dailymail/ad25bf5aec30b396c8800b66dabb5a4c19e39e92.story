Nicky Thornley nearly lost his arm from a spider bite inflicted when he was walking his dog in Northumberland 

A personal trainer nearly lost his arm and may have even been killed by a mystery spider bite inflicted when he was walking his dog. 

Nicky Thornley from Jesmond, Newcastle, had to undergo three operations and spent five days in hospital after being bitten in Ponteland, Northumberland. 

The 33-year-old was warned by doctors if he'd waited any longer to seek treatment, he may have lost his limb or even died. 

After numerous operations to suck the creature's venom out of his finger, experts are still at a loss at what may have caused the gruesome injury.

Mr Thornley saw no cause for concern when his finger started to itch while out walking his dog a fortnight ago. 

He said: 'To begin with I thought I had been bitten by a fly and put some cream on it. 

'I had an itch and I was scratching it but it kept getting worse until it swelled up to the size of a balloon. 

'I was in agony.' 

Three days later, the personal trainer awoke in the middle of the night in excruciating pain, his left hand throbbing. 

'I just knew in myself something was very wrong. I thought, I am going to have to go to casualty. I was in a lot of pain,' he added.  

Upon arrival at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, doctors decided to operate on the man's finger.

'The doctor asked me if I had been abroad, but I hadn’t. The only places I had been were Ponteland, Jesmond and Gosforth.

'It is a mystery.

'I was told if I had left it any longer to seek treatment the situation could have been much worse. I might even have lost a limb. 

The 33-year-old personal trainer thought nothing of his itchy finger before it swelled up and began throbbing 

Mr Thornley urged others who are bitten to seek help as soon as possible to avoid long term damage. Pictured right, a false widow spider which were recorded in higher numbers in the UK this year

'When I went to A&E I thought that I would just be given some different antibiotics. I couldn't believe it when I was told I would need an operation to get the venom out. 

Mr Thornley was left with a scar and several stitches but will make a full recovery

'It was only after the third one that they were happy it had all gone. The poison was still in there after two operations.'

Mr Thornley was left with stitches and an S-shaped scar on his finger but is expected to recover fully. 

He warned others suffering similar symptoms to have their injuries looked at as soon as possible to avoid long-term damage. 

'It is important that these bites are treated quickly otherwise they can become extremely nasty.

'If I’d have ignored it, it would have been a different story.

'The infection was preventing circulation and I could have died or lost a limb.'

Doctors took a sample of the venom in Mr Thornley's finger but have been unable to identify the species responsible for the bite.  

Earlier this year a 44-year-old woman had her finger amputated after being bitten by an unknown spider in County Durham. 

Another woman had to have venom drained from her foot after being bitten by a false widow at her home in Strood, Kent.
