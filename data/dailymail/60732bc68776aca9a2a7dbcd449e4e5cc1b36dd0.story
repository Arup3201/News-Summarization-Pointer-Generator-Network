Top football agent Phil Smith has slammed the FA for banning him for six months, describing the punishment as ‘completely out of proportion’.

Smith, whose First Artists agency has been one of the leading football businesses for over two decades, has been banned for two years, with 18 months suspended, for third-party  ownership breaches.

The FA decision prevents him from working during the transfer window this summer, which  promises to be highly lucrative with Premier League clubs expected to spend a record sum.

Not happy: Phil Smith has slammed the FA for banning him for six months for a deal involving Matt Phillips

Smith worked for Wycombe Wanderers in negotiating striker Matt Phillips’ move to Blackpool for £350,000 in 2010, with the selling club wanting to pay him a proportion of their 25 per cent sell-on arrangement rather than a straight agent’s commission.

However the FA vetoed Wycombe’s proposal. But when Smith went back to Wycombe after Phillips’ £6million transfer to QPR last August, the club had changed ownership. And instead of recompensing Smith for his original work, the agent was reported to the FA.

Smith said: ‘It’s ridiculous that I have been given such a ban when it was Wycombe who wanted to pay me that way. I earned nothing for this assistance, Wycombe earned in excess of £550,000. Yet the FA, in their supposed wisdom, felt I acted beyond the agent’s charter.

‘The FA are happy to apply their heavily over-staffed and hugely unsuccessful compliance department to punish those who try to help our game maximise its assets. I’ve been made a scapegoat for the FA failing to nail any proper third-party transactions involving a lot of money.’

The biggest objections to FIFA president Sepp Blatter allocating as much as £16million of Zurich’s money to the film United Passions, a vanity project about the history of football’s world ruling body, are expected to come from UEFA.

And certainly the FA will not be impressed with a film that depicts the colonial pre-war rulers of English football as arrogant and out of touch (no change there, then) for refusing to have anything to do with the World Cups in 1930, 1934 and 1938.

Chelsea have concerns over the way their chairman Bruce Buck has been portrayed during the Richard Scudamore sexist text scandal.

Although Buck, a shooting pal of Scudamore, chairs the Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee, only a majority club vote can rule on their beleaguered chief executive’s fate.

Yet the misconception demonstrates just why the League must reform their governance to a far more transparent and independent process.

Watch: Richard Scudamore will be called to account by the FA to deliver his promises

Sepp Blatter, who is due to announce his candidacy for a fifth term as FIFA president at their congress in Sao Paulo next month, has been widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election. Former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, the only candidate so far, will certainly withdraw when Blatter becomes a certain runner.

However, it’s understood that UEFA will definitely put up a candidate because their president Michel Platini does not want Blatter to be elected unopposed.

The Frenchman is unlikely to put himself forward with so much on his plate in Europe. But Platini will search for a credible challenger who wouldn’t be embarrassed by an election defeat.

No trouble: Sepp Blatter is widely expected to stand unopposed in the 2015 election

Shame of fans’ boss

The scenes at the end of the EnglandFans FC match against Frickley Athletic will not impress the FA, who had links with their official supporters’ club team before distancing themselves.

EnglandFans manager Garford Beck stormed on to the pitch after the 5-5 draw – with Frickley winning on penalties — to confront the referee, calling him a cheat. The official then lunged at Beck before players from both sides rushed to keep them apart.

Civil servant Beck said: ‘I was so angry for my players and I had a list of grievances that I wanted to talk to him about. I apologised  afterwards for what I said.’ The FA respect  campaign is obviously alive and well.
