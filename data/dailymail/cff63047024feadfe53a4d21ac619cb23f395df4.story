And because it is 2015, customers will also have access to photo props, so they can share snapshots from their #StarbucksDate on social media.

'There's no better time to celebrate meaningful moments of connection, and encourage new ones, than during Valentine's Day,' said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, in a statement. 

During the pre-Valentine's Day meetup, US customers can choose between a Caffé Verona Coffee Press for Two and a Double Chocolate Chunk Brownie, a Tall Flat White and Chocolate Croissant or a Grande Raspberry Mocha or Grande White Chocolate Mocha and a Heart Cookie - for only $5. 

Ms Rothstein noted that people often 'share important life moments' at Starbucks, including the romantic ones. 

Online dating: Starbucks and Match.com have also created a 'Meet at Starbucks' feature on the dating site, so members can easily arrange coffee meetings

'We've been witness to first dates, marriage proposals, job interviews, friends and families reunited, communities gathering, and so much more in our stores around the world,' she explained. 

The global java giant has also teamed up with Match.com to create a 'Meet at Starbucks' feature on the popular dating site, which allows singles to easily schedule a coffee date with another member. 

According to the Starbucks website, more than three million Match.com members are already listing coffee and conversation as one of their interests. 

'Together, Starbucks and Match have made it easier than ever to turn that first flirt into a first date,' said Sam Yagan, Chief Executive Officer of The Match Group in a statement.

He added: 'More first dates happen at Starbucks than anywhere else'.
