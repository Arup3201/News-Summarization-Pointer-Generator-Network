Singer Jill Scott has come in for flak from her fans after repeatedly tweeting her support for Bill Cosby after a series of rape allegations made against him resurfaced in recent weeks.

Earlier this year the Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University and was photographed receiving it from Cosby.

The comedian resigned from the university’s board of trustees on Tuesday after several weeks of old accusations resurfacing.

Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby - but she instead tweeted her support for the comedian

Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby.

Instead of supporting the cause, Scott tweeted her support for the 77-year-old comedian and actor.

‘So they've proven the alleged allegations? I didn't know. Will they also be giving him back the millions he's donated?’ she tweeted.

The singer soon started receiving a number of tweets from followers expressing their disappointment and even anger with her stance.

‘Disappointed in Jill. Did u need an indictment to believe mike Browns family?,' tweeted one fan.

On November 30, another follower tweeted that Scott wasn’t respecting her platform as an influential performer regarding her tweets in support of Cosby.

Scott has repeatedly stood by her support for Cosby in discussions on Twitter with followers who have taken her to task

'It’s hearsay in a court of law. Tis all. Trust. If this is true, he’ll face his due just like everyone,' she said in one tweet.

'For a world traveled, educated, woman AND mother to take up for a man who has abused women in his past is disheartening,' hit back one person

Scott then posted another tweet saying, 'I’m respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.'

The singer continued to defend Cosby as recently as yesterday whens he accused the media and society of 'attempting to destroy his magnificent legacy'.

After multiple Twitter exchanges defending Cosby, Scott tweeted about rape calling it a cowardly crime and advising her followers to 'GET EVIDENCE' if raped.

'Rape is a despicable, cowardly crime. If you’ve been raped- plz do NOT shower, go to police IMMEDIATELY, have a rap (sic) kit done. GET EVIDENCE.'

Tears: Dickinson, 59, broke down during the CNN interview, where she said Cosby had given her a pill which made her black out, and that she woke up after he raped her

On CNN on Monday night, Janice Dickinson described in graphic detail how Bill Cosby allegedly drugged then raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room more than 30 years ago.

The former supermodel, 59, broke down in tears during the live television interview and accused Cosby of using the offer of career advancement to lure her to a hotel room where he drugged her and raped her while she was unconscious.

Dickinson said she recalled waking up in extreme pain with Cosby's semen staining her clothes, after which she fled. 

Cosby's resignation from Temple was also announced on Monday, he had been a trustee since 1982 and was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker and attendee at basketball games.

In the statement, first obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Cosby said: 'I have always been proud of my association with Temple University.

'I have always wanted to do what would be in the best interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have tendered my resignation from the Temple University Board of Trustees.'

Patrick O’Connor, chairman of the board of trustees, said that Cosby does not want to be a distraction to his colleagues.

He added that the board 'accepts Dr. Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university'. The resignation is believed to be effective immediately.

Mr O'Connor had defended Cosby in a 2005 civil suit filed by a former Temple basketball employee, who accused the star of molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion a year earlier.

Cosby, who has been with his wife Camille for the last 51 years, and the woman later settled for undisclosed terms.

But since the lawsuit was filed, at least 17 other alleged victims have come forward to claim that the star drugged and sexually abused them in decades past.

The comedian has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. His lawyer has previously called the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited'. 

Cosby's decision to resign from the board of trustees reportedly follows a series of high-level talks by university leaders, many of whom had spoken in support of the Temple graduate.

It also follows many other universities' decisions to sever ties with the star, who has donated millions of dollars to numerous academic institutions, and has close links to many others.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign. 

And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name.

At Temple, an online petition urging the university to cut ties with Cosby had garnered more than 1,000 signatures by Monday afternoon.
