A business savvy student has made a staggering £12,000 by selling tins containing fresh air.

Antoine Deblay, 22, from Montcuq, south-west France has been selling his unusual product called Air de Montcuq, where the 'fresh air' of the village of Montcuq can be purchased for the equivalent of £5.

The idea only started as a joke when Mr Deblay put up a proposal on French crowdfunding site kisskissbankbank.com.

He was delighted when the idea ended up raising over £600 and he was able to set up a website and package his product.

Antoine Deblay, 22, from Montcuq, south-west France has been selling his unusual product called Air de Montcuq, where the 'fresh air' of the village of Montcuq can be purchased for the equivalent of £5

His novel idea was covered in the 
French press and the communications student has raked in £12,000 in just
 six months of selling the tinned air.

Bizarrely, the French pronounce the town's unusual name the same way as they say 'my bum' - implying the tinned air is flatulence and could go someway to explaining its popularity across the world as a joke present. 

Mr Deblay said: 'A lot of jokes can be made relating to the name of my village.

'We pronounce it exactly the same as 'mon cul' - meaning 'my bum' - so we are the butt of a lot of jokes.

'I thought, why not make a play on words and put the fresh air of Montcuq for sale in a tin.'

Mr Deblay has been selling his tinned air online and has had orders from America, Canada and Europe.

The 250ml tin can be bought for as little as the equivalent of £5 from Mr Deblay's website and delivery to the US is a further £5.

Mr Deblay said: 'Due to the play on words the tins are very popular with people in France but I have had orders from around the world'.

He said: 'I can't believe how well it has taken off. People are really enjoying the product and I have been inundated with orders.'

On the tins, a message is displayed which reads: 'Fresh air of Montcuq is 100 per cent organic, it immerses you in the depths of the city to refresh your ideas. Ideal when you are in need of creative inspiration. Attention: irreplaceable content, consumable once. Do not leave it open.'

And the website gives an insight into the process behind Air de Montcuq.

It reads: 'We respect the air. In order not to empty Montcuq of its air every week we limit our harvest to 10 litres of air.'

Mr Deblay said: 'I'm delighted with how well the product has sold. I made a good marketing plan around the product and people seem to like it, probably because the word play of 'Air Montcuq' makes them laugh.'
