BBC Sport’s hold on live television rights to The Open for more than half a century could end in 2016 when their contract expires.

Tournament organisers the R&A, who have not considered any other TV partners for most of their 59 years with the Beeb, are now more open to accept an offer from Sky, who dominate golf coverage for the rest of the year.

R&A chief executive Peter Dawson left the door ajar for Sky at Royal Birkdale two years ago when he declared it was not a foregone conclusion that the BBC would win the next TV contract.

And certainly R&A opinion has shifted a lot further towards a subscription TV partner with the astonishing deal done in America by Fox Sports who, with no previous golf experience, have paid more than $1billion over 12 years for US Open rights.

This is regarded as a game-changer on both sides of the Atlantic, with the USGA prepared to relinquish their long partnership with NBC in return for a mountain of dollars.

And the R&A will not want to fall behind the money invested in the other three majors.

Sky, who have shored up their golf contracts after arch-rivals BT Sport made a bid for the PGA tour, are certain to want to add to their portfolio a flagship event such as The Open.

And if they put enough money on the table, the likelihood is that they will.

The Open is no longer protected as a listed event that has to be shown live on terrestrial television.

It is rated the same as home Test cricket, which moved to Sky in 2006, meaning live Open golf can be sold to the highest bidder provided there is provision for a terrestrial highlights show.

Those intending to visit IMG House near the entrance to Royal Liverpool Golf Club should be warned that Ari Emanuel, highly volatile new boss of the sports management giants, is due in Hoylake to watch The Open.

Emanuel chucked out former IMG executive Andrew Croker from a Wimbledon hospitality area despite Croker having been invited in.

Coincidentally, Ari’s brother Rahm, the mayor of Chicago, made a mediocre speech at the gala function in his city where the 2012 Ryder Cup teams were introduced with the entertainment provided by Justin Timberlake and the band Chicago.

The mixed bag of acts for the Glasgow concert at the Hydro Arena ahead of the Gleneagles match in September includes Jake Bugg, Texas, Twin Atlantic and Nina Nesbitt.

Graham Brown, former captain of Royal Liverpool and holder of the amateur course record, has had a difficult time during the long fall-out from his horror speech at the annual golf writers’ dinner at Carnoustie in 2007.

Brown, an R&A rules official at that tournament, made highly derogatory remarks about Japanese golfers and black caddies. There is still enough sensitivity surrounding Brown’s racist comments for Hoylake members to be wary of the AGW event.

Brown has kept a low profile since 2007 but turned up for Sunday lunch in the Hoylake clubhouse wearing a pair of swimming trunks. The next day all Hoylake members received a curt email reminding them of the dress code. One positive for Brown is that he is due to re-marry soon.

BBC Radio 5 Live, who didn’t cover the World Cup third-place play-off for cost reasons, were due to make England commentary a one-man job following Mike Ingham’s retirement. But Alan Green, having signed a two-year contract, will still be doubling up with new football correspondent Jon Murray next season.

Return of the legend: BT Sport may well take up Alan Hansen on his request to cover Liverpool

Meanwhile, expect BT Sport to take up retiring Alan Hansen on his wish to do occasional guest pundit appearances on Liverpool games in the Champions League if the Reds qualify for the 2015-16 competition.

It’s refreshing that forklift driver John Singleton, who qualified for The Open with the help of a couple of wedges he’d never used before, doesn’t believe in too professional a preparation for the event. Singleton was complaining yesterday of a sizeable hangover but said he had two days to recover.
