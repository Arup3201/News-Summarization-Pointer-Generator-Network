'Multi-organ failure': The condition of Ariel Sharon is deteriorating, doctors admit

Former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon was fighting for his life last night after suffering  multiple organ collapse.

The 85-year-old has been in a coma since having a devastating stroke in January 2006 while still in office.

Dr Zeev Rotstein, director of  Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv, said: 'He is in critical condition and his life is definitely in danger.

'The feeling of the doctors treating him and also that of the family with him is that there is a turn for the worse.'

Mr Sharon's family are at his bedside following the news, Dr Rotstein said.

Known as The Bulldozer for his hardline approach, Sharon’s career has stretched across Israel’s 65-year history.

As one of Israel’s most famous generals he was known for his bold tactics and the occasional refusal to obey orders.

He
 is credited with helping to turn the tide of the 1973 Middle East war 
when Arab armies launched a surprise attack on Israel, leading troops 
across the Suez Canal and trapping part of the Egyptian army.

A prominent hard-line voice over the decades, he was elected prime minister in 2001.

In mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the territory.

It was quite a turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured territories.

He later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the centrist Kadima Party.

It seemed he was on his way to an easy re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006.

His deputy, Ehud Olmert, took over and was elected prime minister a few months later.

Mr Sharon had a first, small stroke in December 2005 and was put on blood thinners before experiencing a severe brain hemorrhage on Jan. 4, 2006.

After spending months in the Jerusalem hospital where he was initially treated, Sharon was transferred to the long-term care facility at Tel Hashomer hospital. He was taken home briefly at one point but was returned several days later to the hospital, where he has been since.

Although Sharon never regained full consciousness, his family has said he occasionally blinks his eyes and moves his fingers.
