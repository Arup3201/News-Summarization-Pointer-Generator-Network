Heartbreaking photographs have emerged of an abandoned dog with dirty white fur so matted it was unable to relieve itself.

The male terrier, possibly a Maltese mix, was found in a plastic pet carrier at the Pelton Pond women’s restroom in Clarence Fahnestock State Park, New York, on Saturday morning.

Vets at Putnam County SPCA animal shelter say the pooch was in a 'severe state of neglect', with serious ear infections and signs of malnutrition.

SPCA chief, Ken Ross, said that its tangled coat was 'causing extreme discomfort and actually prevented the dog from defecating.'

The pup, believed to be three or four years old, has since had its body shaved and is on the mend.

'He's doing great . . . he's a happy little dog. His ears are healing too,' a status update posted to Facebook read.

Ross said due to the dog’s 'severe case of neglect and its apparent abandonment,' the SPCA is treating the case as a criminal matter.

The two charges each carry a sentence of up to one year in jail or a $1,000 fine.

Anyone with information about the dog is asked to call the SPCA's animal cruelty hotline at 845-520-6915.

They will not be accepting adoption inquiries until the animal has been given a clean bill of health.
