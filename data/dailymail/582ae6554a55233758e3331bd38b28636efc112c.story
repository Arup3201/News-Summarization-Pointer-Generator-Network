Stuart Lancaster's unchanged England squad were put through their paces on Thursday as they prepare for the second leg of a potential Grand Slam.

England face Italy at Twickenham on Saturday off the back of an outstanding performance to beat Wales 21-16 in Cardiff last weekend.

With no further knocks to his injury-ravaged squad Lancaster was able to name the same XV for consecutive matches for the first time since the opening two rounds of last year's Six Nations.

There was some bad news for England on Thursday, however, as Lancaster confirmed prop David Wilson will miss the entire Championship with a nerve problem in his neck.

The 29-year-old Bath tighthead be sidelined for up to three months.

'David has seen the specialist and will be out for the Six Nations,' Lancaster said. 'He's booked in for an operation tomorrow that will relieve his nerve impingement. He'll be out for 10-12 weeks.'
