Way back when, relationships and friendships between co-workers were, not so common, a majority instead opting for the more professional dealings with their colleagues.

But it seems times have changed and in a big way, as our private and professional lives become more intertwined, social media taking down the barriers as we connect with colleagues both online and offline outside of work. 

A nation wide survey by jobs platform OneShift has found that a vast majority of Australian workers now don't actually mind being friends with workers on social media. 

It found 79 per cent thought it was appropriate to be friends with their co-workers on Facebook and Instagram.

Majority of people are becoming friends with colleagues at work

Surprisingly, the majority, 63 per cent,  said this did not affect what they posted about or the photos they shared, even if they weren't so work appropriate.

'I think people are connecting in different ways,' said founder and CEO of Oneshift's Gen George.

'Back then, there were no smart phones or social media but now it's normal for people to skype, have 24/7 instant chats which allows for a lot faster pace environment.'

'It's not your usual 9 to 5 job anymore.'

Ms George says 20 years ago the norm was people going to work, seeing their colleagues and then going home, living a very separate work life and personal life, but now everything is integrated. 

'The more you look at Gen Y people, they are receptive to putting things on line,' she said.

'It's acceptable growing up with the connection of social media, colleagues have a different perception when they haven’t grown up with it.'

But our affection for our colleagues extends far beyond social media with 64 per cent also saying they socialise with their co-workers outside of work.

'We are spending more time with colleagues and becoming more part of their life, we're embracing it.'

And while there was always the advice of not 'going there' while at work, it seems in many instances, affections between colleagues have become more than just platonic.

More than 40 per cent have admitted to dating a co-worker and the good news for those wanting to jump into a work romance, it's been found you won't be judged too harshly among your work peers.

Almost 80 per cent of those surveyed said they wouldn't feel uncomfortable if two of their colleagues were dating, although 10 per cent said they kept a long relationship with a colleague secret.

It was also found more than 6 in 10 Australian workers like to have a drink with their colleagues. 

Ms George, said the strong relationships formed at work are an inevitable result of a new work culture that no longer recognises the separation of our work life from our private life, but that this shouldn’t be viewed negatively.

'If someone is expected to respond to emails on their smartphone or the company’s social media channel at 10.30 at night, then the office has already invaded the home,' she said.

'It’s no surprise then that with those walls breaking down, we’re more comfortable socialising with colleagues outside of work, whether that’s online, at the local pub or cinema after work, or at the beach on the weekend.'

And while some would be hesitant to get too involved with their co-workers, Ms George says a more social workplace should be encouraged. 

'Work life balance is key, but that concept is taking on a new meaning today. It’s all part of the attitude of working to live, rather than living to work.'

'You should love what you do, and enjoy the people you work with. Rather than aiming for that distinct separation of the two, we should be looking at how work fits into the rest of your life.'

'The friendships you have with your colleagues are important not only to your own success, but to the success of the business and should be encouraged by employers,' said Ms George.

Jane Lu, Founder of Showpo Fashion says her team at work are all Facebook friends.

'Our team supports everyone with extra curriculum lifestyles, we have nothing to hide form each other,' she said.

She says most people these days are well aware of what to post and what not to post. 

'I think you'd have to be stupid to chuck a sickie and post that you're on the beach.'

With a small team of eight, she says that gets along so well people want to come to work, because otherwise they are creating more work for other people.

The Showpo Fashion team even plan and take holidays together and spend plenty of time out of work hanging out.

'Have Friday night drinks every week, holidays together, get togethers, it's important we have good relationships at work.'

'People work better who enjoy coming to work, sometimes we take a long lunch but still get work done and people will stay back to do it.'
