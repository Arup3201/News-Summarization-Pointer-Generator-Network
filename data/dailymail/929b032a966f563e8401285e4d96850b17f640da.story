The former bodyguard suing Britney Spears for sexual harassment has made yet more unsavoury claims about his former employer.

Fernando Flores launched a lawsuit in September claiming that Spears continuously exposed herself and attempted to lure him into bed during his time working for her from February to July 2010.

Now the singer's lawyers have filed a motion to strike his latest allegations, saying his claims that the star, 29, had disgusting hygiene habits and used drugs are false.

Allegations: The former bodyguard of Britney Spears has made new claims about the singer, saying she was on drugs and had terrible personal hygiene

'He's a liar,' one of Spears' entourage allegedly told TMZ.

'Spears was generally personally unkempt' during Flores' time working for the singer, he claims in new court documents.

Flores is seeking $10million for psychological damage suffered as a result of the 'unwanted' sexual advances he alleges.

In court documents, obtained by star magazine and Radar Online, Flores outlines the reasons: 'She broke wind or picked her nose unselfconsciously and unapologetically before Plaintiff (Flores) and others and she was constantly and gratuitously loud and profane in her speech.

'She did not bathe for days on end, did not use deodorant, did not brush her teeth, did not fix her hair, did not wear shoes or socks.'

The documents also reveal his claims that Spears used drugs. 'Based on his former experience as a police officer, Plaintiff (Flores) is informed and believes and alleged thereon that Defendant Spears was often under the influence of illegal prescription and non-prescription drugs, such as Ritalin, Narcon (Naloxone) and methamphetamines,' it reads.

In her motion to strike the latest lewd claims, Spears says Flores is simply trying to 'embellish on his tale of lewd and sensational allegations.'

The claims 'contain a litany of insults toward Ms. Spears that are clearly designed to prejudice Ms. Spears in the eyes of the public and the Court.'

of employment in March 2010) 'did not shower for days, picked her nose 
and broke wind unapologetically'

Spears' spokesperson pointed out after the scandal originally broke that details of Flores' claims were leaked to the media before the lawsuit was even filed.

‘This lawsuit is another unfortunate situation where someone is trying to take advantage of the Spears family and make a name of himself,' they said at the time.

‘Ms. Spears and her attorneys have every expectation that this matter will be dismissed by the courts.’

Fernando's initial allegations about Britney's sexual appetite and treatment of her children came just as the singer was re-establishing herself as a serious artist after a tumultuous few years in her personal life.

Damaging: In the lawsuit, it is alleged that Britney mistreated her sons Jayden James and Sean Preston, though the boys' father Kevin Federline has deemed them unfounded

Flores said he had been warned about Spears' behaviour on his first day of employment by other members of staff who he claims also suffered harassment.

Court documents describe one alleged incident in which ‘She leaned over me and I noticed that her right breast was exposed. She looked me right in the eye like she was waiting for something.’

Flores alleges that on another occasion: ‘She [Britney] was wearing a white lace, see-through dress. She walked over close by [Flores], intentionally dropped her cigarette lighter on the floor, bent over to retrieve it and thereby exposed her uncovered genitals to [Flores].

‘The incident caused [Flores] shock and disgust’.

The suit goes on to claim that ‘in addition to exposing herself to [Flores], Spears engaged in numerous sex acts in front of [Flores].’

‘Plaintiff perceived, during security 
checks of the perimeter, Defendant loudly having sexual relations while 
her two children were in the suite with her.’

According to Flores' claims, Britney 
created fantasy personalities and some days wanted to be called ‘Queen 
B’ while on others ‘Jennifer’.

Amidst allegations that the singer hit her children, Flores also claimed she had a violent relationship with boyfriend Jason Trawick and claims to have witnessed the singer ‘savagely hitting’ her son with a belt.

On another occasion, Britney allegedly made the children eat crab meat even though she knew they had serious fish allergies.

When both kids started vomiting, Spears apparently wouldn’t allow anyone to intervene, saying, ‘Mind your own f***ing business!’

Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has supported Britney throughout, and after looking into the allegations has said the allegations are unfounded.

Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said in September: ‘He is satisfied that the allegations are a product of economic motives.  They are as baseless as they seem.’

Britney is in the middle of her Femme Fatale north American tour, wrapping up in North Carolina on August 25.

After a month break the singer will then embark on a European tour, playing dates in several countries including the UK, Russia, Sweden, Germany and France before the tour ends in November.
