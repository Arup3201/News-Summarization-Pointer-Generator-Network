Formula One driver Fernando Alonso is putting in the hard graft in the gym as the McLaren driver edges nearer to returning to the grid following a pre-season crash last month.

The Spaniard spent three days in hospital after suffering concussion having crashed during pre-season testing in Catalunya on February 22.

As a result the 2005 and 2006 World Champion will miss the 2015 season opener in Australia on Sunday but the 33-year-old reassured fans he is well on the road to recovery.

Alonso posted a picture on his Twitter account clasping a dumbbell weight in the gym as he prepares to get back in the cockpit for race two of the season in Kuala Lumpur at the end of March.

He accompanied the picture with the caption: ‘I keep working hard. Back to normal routine. Back to the office soon... #CountdownMalaysia #McLarenHonda.’

Doctors ruled out Alonso from the opening race in Melbourne this weekend due to the concussion he suffered in Barcelona, insisting he cannot be exposed to a second knock to the head, which doctors fear could kill him.

Fortunately Alonso seems to have been putting his spare time to use and is clearly pumped to start another F1 title challenge.
