The mother of a four-year-old girl mauled to death by their pet bulldog has spoken of her agony at losing her 'bubbly' daughter in such horrific circumstances.

Lexi Branson was killed when the family's newly-adopted Aylesbury-type bulldog attacked her as watched TV during a sick day off school.

An inquest heard how the dog suddenly attacked Lexi, targeting her throat, while her mother Jodi Hudson frantically tried to stop the attack before stabbing the dog to death with a kitchen knife.

In a family statement, read today by a police officer outside the coroner's court, Ms Hudson said: 'The last 10 months have been extremely difficult for me and all who knew and loved Lexi.

'She was a bubbly girl who always had a smile and brought happiness to everyone she met.

'We still think about her every day and she lives on in our hearts as we have such wonderful memories of her.

She added: 'Her death 
is still too painful to talk about. I would like to thank all my family,
 friends and the members of the public for their support over the last 
10 months.

'Without
 them the ordeal would have been far worse and I'm taking each day as it
 comes and hopefully in time the tragic events of that afternoon will 
ease.'

Earlier today, the inquest heard the kennels supplying the large and powerful dog never carried out a home visit.

The
 dog had been assessed as suitable for re-homing by staff at Willow Tree
 Kennels, but with a note it may not be right for a home with 'smaller 
children'.

Yesterday, Ms Hudson said she had met the dog at the kennels for 15 minutes, and querying the note, was told this was down to its size and 'a tendency to jump up'.

Staff also said it showed no sign of aggression, was 'placid', and had 'a lovely temperament'.

Senior coroner Trevor Kirkman asked Willow Tree Kennels' owner Michael Watts about its policy and procedures on re-homing.

Mr Kirkman said: 'I'm trying to establish the circumstances in which a home visit would be appropriate.

'So we have a large dog, large and powerful - a note it might be better re-homed in a home with no small children.'

He added staff also knew Ms Hudson lived in a ground-floor, two-bed flat, then asked Mr Watts: 'When would you consider it appropriate to visit that home?'

Mr Watts said it depended on factors including the potential owner's knowledge of dogs and personal circumstances.

He also said: 'The dog was not a big dog, it was labrador-sized.'

However, yesterday kennel staff said the dog was too big to do a 'pick-up' test, which is used to assess an animal's temperament.

Mr Watts added home visits were not always needed in line with industry guidance.

None of the staff at the kennels, which was contracted by Leicester City Council to take its strays until last November, had had any external training.

At the conclusion of the inquest Mr Watts extended his sympathies to the family.

He said the evidence had shown its re-homing procedures were 'in accordance with the principles employed by other similar organisations', and that nobody had 'detected the slightest hint of aggression in the dog' prior to its attack.

'If we had been told that the previous keepers were concerned about aggressive behaviour and were worried about the possibility of such conduct towards their children, then the animal would have been euthanised in our facility and in any other responsible facility.'

Recording his short narrative verdict today, Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, said: 'Lexi Branson died as a result of injuries received in an attack upon her by a dog within her home.'

He added: 'This must rank as one of the most harrowing cases.

'I know it cannot have been easy to those nearest and dearest to Lexi to have sat through the evidence.'

He added: 'I offer my sincere condolences to the members of the family and friends who lost a lovely little girl tragically, in the circumstances we have heard.'

Mr Kirkman said there was 'no question of apportioning blame', but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and strengthen the rules around re-homing stray dogs.

In closing the inquest today, he said his report would be directed at 'the appropriate authorities'.

Yesterday the coroner heard Lexi's mother describe the fatal attack.

She said the powerful bulldog started 'staring' at her little daughter, before going 'straight for her throat'.

Desperate to get the animal - called Mulan - off the girl, she tried to smash a glass over the dog, then pull its legs apart, before trying to pry its jaws loose.

She rushed to the kitchen and 'grabbed the largest knife I could find', plunging the blade repeatedly into the dog which eventually released Lexi.

The little girl, off sick from school that day, died from facial injuries and suffocation caused by the dog's jaws covering her mouth, a post mortem found.

Yesterday the coroner heard an account of the attack from Lexi's mother Jodi Hudson (pictured outside the courthouse today), who described stabbing the animal to death with a kitchen knife after it began mauling her daughter

A series of kennel staff told Mr Kirkman the dog had shown no aggressive behaviour, with one describing it as 'very sweet natured' with a 'lovely temperament'.

However, Mulan had recently attacked another family pet at its previous home - a fact unknown to both the kennels and Ms Hudson.

The dog only ended up at the kennels when the previous male owner lied to the council dog warden, telling them it was a stray, so he would not have to pay to have it re-homed.

Detective Sergeant Kenny Henry, of Leicestershire Police, said it had attacked that previous owner's other dog in the back garden of his Leicester home.

That owner also told the RSPCA he was 'concerned for the safety of his own children' following the attack.

But while dog warden Jodie Barlow told the inquest Mulan had 'seemed ok' when she first picked it up, a note was shown to court where the warden had described the animal as looking 'like she has been fighting, with marks all over her face'.

Mr Kirkman, recording a short narrative verdict, said there was 'no question of apportioning blame', but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and 'prevent future such deaths'.

Outside the court, the little girl's grandparents welcomed Mr Kirkman's move and said they were 'very surprised' no standard set of rules governing the re-homing of strays already existed.

Alan and Kathryn Tait said: 'We're glad he's going to recommend some changes be made regulating the law on re-homing stray dogs.

They added: 'We're surprised nothing like that already exists.

'I think people, like we did, just assume those rules are in place, but they're not. It was a shock.'
