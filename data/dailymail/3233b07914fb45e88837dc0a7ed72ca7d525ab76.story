A grieving mother has been left furious after the council she works for sent her a £700 bill for a bench in memory of her three-year-old daughter.

The bench was put up in Keighley Town Hall Square, West Yorkshire, last year in memory of councillor Andrea Walker's daughter, Ellie, who tragically died in January 2013 from blood poisoning.

But a few weeks ago cllr Walker received a letter from Graham Mitchell, the council's chairman, asking her about repayments.

Cllr Walker, who has been with the Keighley Town Council for 11 years, said the letter was an insult to her dead daughter.

This incident is the latest embarrassment for the beleaguered town council, after a report last month into its workings identified a catalogue of weaknesses and potentially unlawful practices.

A report  by the Audit Commission, uncovered 'a number of significant weaknesses in the Council's governance.' 

The report said: 'In particular we have identified evidence that poor governance has led to the Council to make decisions due consideration of its legal powers and, as a consequence, to take actions that may be unlawful.'

The report concluded that the council has failed to properly safeguard public money because of a lack of internal controls. 

MS Walker claims the council has previously paid for benches in memory of councillors and she believed a 'verbal agreement' had been made that her bench would be sponsored or paid for out of council funds.

She also said she was led to believe she would not have to pay for the bench and is upset at now being told to pay up.

Cllr Walker has admitted she cannot remember exactly what was said at the time because she was taking anti-depressant drugs.

She also said she has not received any paperwork other than the letter and a 'Sales Statement,' received last week, which said 'Please return remittance slip. Total due £703.'

Cllr Mitchell suggested in his letter that until the matter is resolved, it might be better for cllr Walker not to attend finance and audit committee meetings 'or at least any portion of a meeting which might have to discuss this matter.'

He added: 'Please understand that this is not an instruction from me. 

'This is only a suggestion from me as Chair of the Council and the decision as to whether you attend or not must be entirely yours.'

Cllr Mitchell told cllr Walker that 'our many critics, especially those on Facebook, could cause you considerable embarrassment if they felt you were participating in discussions in the Finance and Audit Committee, about your personal financial circumstances.

'I am sure that you understand that we all have to take extra care regarding our interests at this difficult time.' 

Senior councillors have said the situation with the bench is 'puzzling' and 'bizarre'.

One councillor said he believed there had been a 'verbal agreement' to provide a 'loan' which would be repaid.

He claimed cllr Walker had already repaid some of the money, but she denies paying anything.

The senior councillor, who asked not to be named, said he had opposed providing a bench free of charge because 'it would set a precedent - if we put a bench for one, we would have to do it for everybody.'

He said moves were being made by colleagues to have the debt 'written off'  - but that he would be opposing this.

'I think that she should pay it back. I will be voting against writing the debt off. It's a bizarre story, I find it puzzling.'

A council meeting on Thursday saw a decision to write off the £703 debt deferred.

A finance committee has already voted that it should not be pursued.
