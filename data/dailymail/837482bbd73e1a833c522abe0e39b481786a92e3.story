Jos Buttler was 14 when he discovered he had not quite got to the pitch of the ball in a first XI game for King’s College Taunton against West Country rivals Blundell’s School. But he didn’t panic.

Extending his hands through the shot, he deposited the Blundell’s off-spinner over extra cover for six. Then he did it again.

His coach was Dennis Breakwell, the former Northamptonshire and Somerset slow left-armer. ‘He just went “bump”.

What a blast: Big-hitting Jos Buttler blazes away for England

'He hit the ball that hard. It was timing. It’s a gift. You can’t coach that sort of thing.’

By the time Buttler was 16, and averaging almost 95 as King’s captain, Breakwell reckoned he was a ‘better cricketer ability-wise than Ian Botham at that age’.

Until then Breakwell, who is still head groundsman at the school, believed the best 16-year-old he had seen was his old Northamptonshire team-mate Peter Willey. ‘Then I saw Jos Buttler.’

With English cricket aching for a good-news story, there is of course the risk of saddling a Test debutant with an impossible burden.

And so far Buttler’s most eye-catching deeds — not least  an incendiary 74-ball 121 in a  one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s two months ago — have come in the limited-overs arena.

But it would take a peculiarly English kind of conservatism to play down the potential of the nation’s new wicketkeeper-batsman. Unsurprisingly, that conservatism has already had an airing.

After the fireworks at Lord’s, Alastair Cook suggested Buttler, 23, was not ready for Test cricket. It felt like an unnecessary slap on the wrist. Yet the demise of Matt Prior means he can set about laying the angst to rest, starting with Sunday’s third Test against India in Southampton.

There will be failures along the way. But for those who knew him growing up, there is little doubt he will make the job his.

‘I’ve got a bet on that he’ll be England captain in five years,’ said Breakwell. ‘Odds of 14-1.’ How much did he wager?

A slight pause. ‘I had a nice bet.’

Promise: Buttler was better cricketer ability-wise than England legend Ian Botham at 16

Andy Hurry, the Somerset head coach who was in charge when Buttler first played top-level cricket at the age of 18 in 2009, remembers the smallest of cameos that year at the Twenty20 Champions League in India. ‘Our last game was against New South Wales and he had to face Brett Lee. He dealt with it superbly.’

Buttler faced just three balls from the Aussie paceman, scoring three runs. But Hurry had seen enough. ‘You find out quickly if someone can make the step up mentally.’

Buttler’s USP might be his one-day international strike-rate, which is a frightening 128, and the full spectrum of strokes. But what of his other talents?

Hurry said: ‘First, he’s a student of the game. He wants to be the best he can. He speaks to the senior players a lot to find out ways of improving. He has incredible hand-eye coordination and belief. I’ve got no issues at all about whether he’ll make the step up.’

There is passion, too. Breakwell recalls Buttler’s reaction to his dismissal after making a century against Millfield School aged 14. ‘He got out just before we won, and he cried. He still gets emotional. He’s a genuinely nice guy.’

Concerns Buttler’s batting was more attuned to white-ball than red-ball cricket have been assuaged this summer following his move from Somerset to Lancashire. Playing for a team that is facing relegation, he has averaged 40, with one hundred and five 50s.

‘He’s a long way down the road with his batting compared to where he was,’ said Hurry. ‘He’s batting higher up the order and is moving forward.’

Hurry and Breakwell still follow Buttler’s progress, with a mixture of pride and anxiety. ‘I won’t be going to Southampton,’ said Breakwell. ‘The school are trying to get me to go, but I’ll be too  nervous.’ He might be talking for everyone in English cricket.
