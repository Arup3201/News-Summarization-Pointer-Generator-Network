A bee sting may have been the cause of a fatal accident, which saw a motorcyclist run off the road and crash into a traffic island.

At about 3:30pm on Sunday, police say a 29 year old man from Mundijong was riding a Suzuki motorbike along Armadale road in Forrestdale, a suburb south of Perth, when it's believed he struck the centre island.

It's believed the man may have earlier been stung by a bee and started to feel unwell but police are unable to confirm whether that may have been the direct cause of the crash.

Members of the public including an off duty police officer administered first aid, including CPR before paramedics arrived.

St John Ambulance took the man to the Armadale, Kelmscott hospital but he died a short time later.

A police media spokesperson says the coroner will have to determine whether the bee sting was what caused the man to die.

Major crash investigators are also seeking information to the fatal crash asking anyone who saw the motorcycle prior to the crash to call Crime Stoppers.
