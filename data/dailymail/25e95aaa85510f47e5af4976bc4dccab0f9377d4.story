The oddball political marriage of Richard Nixon's grandson to a much-younger billionaire grocery heiress is ending after three years. 

Andrea Catsimatidis filed for divorce on Wednesday from Christopher Nixon Cox in Manhattan family court.

It's unknown what caused the break up, which began with a lavish 2011 ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Some of New York's biggest political names - including Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger - were in attendance.

The divorce is uncontested so the case is likely to be resolved quickly. There is no word on what sort of financial settlement is involved, according to the New York Post.

Catsimatidis is the daughter of John Catsimatidis, the owner of the Gristedes grocery chain and a former New York City Republican mayoral candidate. His fortunate is estimated at $3.1billion.

Nixon Cox is the only son of Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon and Edward Cox, the longtime New York Republican State Committee. 

Nixon Cox met Catsimatidis at her exclusive all-girls New York high school when he was campaigning for John McCain in 2008. She was just 17 at the time.

The divorce is not contested, meaning it will likely be resolved quickly and with minimal public drama

Nixon Cox is 11 years older than Catsimatidis, now 24. 

After their courtship, Catsimatidis became the talk of the Long Island social scene when she starting showing up to Nixon Cox's staid political gatherings wearing skin-tight skirts and bosom-bearing tops. 

Last year, the couple traveled to Beijing to retrace Richard Nixon's seminal 1972 trip to China. 

The couple have not commented on the split or what may have caused it.

They were we last pictured on a romantic European vacation together in July shortly after Catsimatidis celebrated her 24th birthday. 

She caused a stir this week when she posed in a very low-cut dress with former President Bill Clinton. The picture turned into a viral meme that defended Bill Cosby from rape allegations and accused Clinton of harassing women.

His parents are Tricia Nixon, daughter of Richard Nixon, and Edward Cox, a longtime New York state Republican party chairman
