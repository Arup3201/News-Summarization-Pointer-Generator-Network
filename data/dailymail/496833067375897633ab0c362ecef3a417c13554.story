Manchester United are on the verge of sealing the sensational transfer of Argentinian winger Angel Di Maria for £60 million — a record fee paid by a British club.

United have been working on a deal for the Real Madrid star for the past month and Sportsmail revealed last Monday that they have offered him a £200,000-a-week incentivised package to compensate for the fact that they cannot offer him Champions League football this season.

In addition to the fee, it is believed there are add-ons which amount to another £8m. Now it is understood Di Maria has told United he will come and Old Trafford sources indicated that the club was making progress in terms of agreeing a fee with Madrid.

Time is up: Di Maria is expected to be a Manchester United player if the club can agree a fee with Real Madrid

The 26-year-old has already spoken with United manager Louis van Gaal about his proposed role and he is expected to be handed the iconic No 7 shirt at Old Trafford.

Ironically, it is understood that in the past week, Manchester City were asked by Di Maria’s representatives to join in the bidding for him but City declined.

If Real Madrid agree the £60m fee it will exceed by £10m the previous record of £50m paid by Chelsea for striker Fernando Torres in January 2011.

United last night refused to comment on the situation.
