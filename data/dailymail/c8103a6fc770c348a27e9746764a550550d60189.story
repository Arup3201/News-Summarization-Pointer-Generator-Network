A brother and his sister are suing an Ohio hospital after a nurse accidentally threw away a kidney he had donated to save her life.

Surgeons at the University of Toledo Medical Center removed the organ from Paul Fudacz Jr. on August 10, 2012 to give it to his then 24-year-old sister Sarah Fudacz - but a nurse, Judith Moore, threw it away as she discarded the contents of a slush machine before the operation was over.

Doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the organ for two hours after the accident was discovered.

After consulting with the family, physicians decided not to risk using the kidney because they thought it was likely another compatible donor could be found.

The hospital, which found another donor for Sarah and covered her traveling costs so she could undergo the surgery in Colorado, is now trying to dismiss their lawsuit and recover its own costs.

Sarah, John, 
their parents, and their four siblings filed a lawsuit on July 29 against 
UTMC in the Court of Claims in Columbus.They individually demand $25,000, plus interest and the costs of 
the suit.

Their attorney Jim Arnold said UTMC had been accommodating after the mix up but that the Ohio attorney generalâ€™s office, which 
represents UTMC, would not accept some of the family's demands.

On Tuesday, the medical center responded to the Fudacz family lawsuit, acknowledging the organ was discarded but denying some of the Fudacz 
claims, the Toledo Blade reported.

It did not ask the court to dismiss the charge of criminal negligence, but did dispute the family's claim that there was a 'parental loss of consortium' and 'sibling loss of 
consortium' - the legal terms for when an incident affects relationships.

Surgeon: Dr Michael Rees continues to work at the hospital but two nurses have been fired

There is 'no right to 
compensation for parental loss of consortium of an adult,' it said. 'There is no right to compensation for sibling loss of
consortium in a non-death case.'

Larry
Burns, the university's vice president for external affairs, said he 
did not know how much the medical center paid the family, including the cost of the trip to Colorado.

After the mix-up, live-donor kidney transplants 
were suspended voluntarily at the medical center - and there was a host of staff changes.

Dr. Michael Rees, who performed the surgery, still works at the medical center while two nurses, Moore and Melanie Lemay, no longer work there and the administrator of surgical services, Edwin Hall, was 
placed on paid administrative leave.

Moore, who threw away the slush machine contents before the surgery was over, resigned on 
September 10 last year, while the hospital fired Lemay, a full-time nurse.

Lemay, who took over when Moore went on a lunch break, did not update her on
the status of the surgery when she returned from her break, disciplinary records showed, the Blade reported.

She has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge, 
defamation, slander, and libel and seeks damages exceeding $25,000.

Disastrous error: An investigation is underway at the University of Toledo Medical Center after a nurse
accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister

Humans do not need two kidneys to live, the body
can support life with only one. If one functional kidney is missing 
from birth, the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the 
combined weight of two kidneys

This kind of accident is unheard of in
organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the 
kidney, Dr William Harmon, director of kidney transplantation at Boston 
Children's Hospital, told the Blade.

'This
is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect, and there 
have been far worse cases where the donor has died,' Harmon said.

There
were 16,816 kidney transplants nationwide last year from live donors 
and from those who consented to organ donation through state registries 
should they die from an illness or accident, the newspaper reported.

Last
year, 136 people in Ohio died waiting for a kidney, and 4,711 people 
died nationally waiting for a kidney, the newspaper reported.
