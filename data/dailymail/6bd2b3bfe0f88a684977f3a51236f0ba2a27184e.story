'Moron': U.S. real-estate tycoon Donald Trump was ridiculed for blaming yesterday's massacre of journalists on France's gun-control laws

Donald Trump has been labelled a moron on Twitter for suggesting the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre were denied 'a fighting chance' by France's gun laws.

In a series of tweets, the generously coiffed real-estate tycoon suggested the gunmen were only able to murder with impunity because there were no armed bystanders to shoot back.

Twitter users' responses were mixed, but generally negative. The first reply, by Molly Lambourn from Melbourne, Australia, said: '[W]hat a complete idiot. More people would have f***ing died!!! Heaps of crossfire!!!'

Trump's tweets, posted less than 12 hours after news broke of the slaughter in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, said: 'If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance.

'Isn't it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world?

'Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!'

By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first tweet alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. About another 80 responses mentioned the word 'idiot', although not all were directly critical of Trump. 

However, Trump's pronouncement was chosen as a 'favourite' by 933 people and retweeted 1,488 times, and many - though by no means the majority - of responses were supportive of his view.

Responding to Trump, Terry Brown, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, wrote on Twitter: '[G]ive everyone guns - how can American murder scenes be wrong?'

Canadian Cari Ramsey from London, Ontario, wrote: '[N]one of them would have had a shot! NONE! 2 guys with AK47s surprised a room. Guns would have done nothing!'

Steve Dickinson, from Cumbria, told Trump: 'Just like the guys in the Boston Marathon hey Donald?'

Another user who identified herself only as HillyFoz replied to the tycoon: 'THEY WERE JOURNALISTS. NOT STUPID GUN TOTING RED NECKS. GO BOIL YOUR WIG'.

Moreover, gun laws in France are not so restrictive as Trump seems to believe. Possession of automatic firearms is banned across the European Union, except in special circumstances. But that law is similar in the U.S., where citizens must have permission from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to possess fully automatic weapons.

In France citizens must have a licence to buy a weapon, but once one is obtained they can use it to buy handguns and even semi-automatic rifles - the kind where all you have to do is pull the trigger to fire. Both such weapons are banned in the mainland UK.

Despite the law, France has long had a problem with organised criminal gangs with access Kalashnikov assault rifles, said Mark Mastaglio of the Forensic Firearms Consultancy.

'There was also a spate in France of criminals using rocket-propelled grenades for robberies and even prison breaks,' Mr Mastaglio told MailOnline.

He said French criminals' relative ease of access to automatic weapons raised an important question about the circumstances of yesterday's massacre in Paris, where the gunmen fired in single shots throughout.

'If they did have fully-automatic Kalashnikovs and they opted to use single shots that suggests a degree of military training, because as you use the fully automatic fire accuracy goes down.'

Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade today remained on the run.

As the manhunt for Cherif and Said Kouachi continued, their alleged getaway driver Hamyd Mourad, 18, turned himself into police in Charleville-Mezieres in northern France.

The fact that two were still at large almost 24 hours after a gun battle in which two policemen died alongside ten others, mainly magazine staff, was also a cause for huge concern.

France is today holding a day of mourning for the 12 people killed during the country's worst terrorist atrocity this century.

A minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital will toll.
