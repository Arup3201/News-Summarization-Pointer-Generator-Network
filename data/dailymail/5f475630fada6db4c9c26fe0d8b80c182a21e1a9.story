When you think of Wayne Rooney, what are your standout memories? I have three.

The first is of him as a fresh-faced and fearless 18-year-old, lighting up Euro 2004; second is his magnificent season in 2009-10 when he fired 34 goals for Manchester United and was named PFA Player of the Year. Third comes the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign when he scored nine times under Fabio Capello.

Others will have their own highlights but it is doubtful anyone will place Wednesday’s game against Norway at the top of their list. Though he marked his first match as captain with an emphatically dispatched penalty, nobody was in a hurry to shout about his display.

If anything, it raised a question: have we seen the best of him?

Finish: Rooney was in the form of his life in the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign for England

Rooney is 28 and during the next three years he will be in the period commonly regarded as being the peak for a footballer.

For the vast majority, it is the spell when they produce form of higher quality and greater consistency than ever.

Yet Wayne is different. Making his debut in the Barclays Premier League at 16 confirmed him as exceptional but it also meant there was potential for him to peak early. 

Having made 615 appearances for club and country, he has stats that you would expect of a player in his mid-30s.

Think about it. Cars are not valued by their licence plate but on how many miles they have done. 

Competing at the highest level for the past 12 years, with all the pressure and intensity that accompanies it, leaves a mark.

Can you imagine, from the age of 18, having to carry the burden of being the man for club and country?

Playing at the highest level is mentally and physically draining and the pressure on players like Rooney takes a toll.

What is happening to Wayne is not unprecedented.

 Look through the history books and you will see that those forwards who burst on to the scene as teenagers were rarely able to sustain that impact and consistency for entire careers.

Defenders tend to have longer careers because it is possible for them to plod through games but with forwards, it is all about being explosive. 

Sharp movements, swift changes of gear, constantly operating on the edge, while taking a battering in the process.

Look at Robbie Fowler. When he was 19, he was Liverpool’s best player and for three seasons, between 1994 and 1997, his goal record was exceptional but when he reached 26, he was no longer first choice at Anfield.

Michael Owen burst on to the scene. Like Wayne, he was seen as the saviour for his club and country at the age of 18. Michael was sensational between 1998 and 2002, winning the Ballon d’Or, but physically and mentally it was a big burden to carry.

By the time of Euro 2004, there were calls for Michael to be replaced by Wayne. Michael moved to Real Madrid that summer but he would admit his best form was before he was 25. Neither Michael nor Robbie were helped by injuries - were they triggered by starting out so young?

Skipper: Rooney has been given both the United and England captaincy but is no longer as explosive

Games: Rooney has played 615 matches in his career at the age of 28, as many as players in their mid-30s

Best years behind him: Owen left Liverpool for Real Madrid and then Newcastle United but was not as potent

Maybe that needs to be considered with Raheem Sterling. He is in the position Wayne and Michael were in - the rising young star of English football - but it’s important he is protected and not flogged by club and country in the next few years.

This problem is not confined to English players. Take Raul, for example. A 16-year-old sensation at Real Madrid, Sir Alex Ferguson once called him ‘the best in the world’. He scored 134 goals in a five-season spell, between 1998 and 2002, when Madrid won three European Cups.

Over the next eight years, he scored 131 but in his final few seasons at the Bernabeu, he was a shadow of the player he had been. Did that stem from being overplayed and subjected to great mental pressure from so early on?

Even the absolute best, the Brazilian Ronaldo and Thierry Henry, found their influence fading by their late 20s (both played top-flight football as teenagers) and there has been talk that we may not see again the Lionel Messi who mesmerised for Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. There is no doubt that last season, and his performances at the World Cup, showed there is less dynamism in his game, comments which have also been made about Rooney.

Oustanding: Raheem Sterling, at 19 years old, has been a stand-out performer for England this summer

Environment: Carragher is worried that Sterling may shine as youngster but, like Rooney, wane as he ages

Peaked too soon? Raul's goalscoring ratio deteriorated quite rapidly as his career at Real Madrid progressed

Wane: Strikers Thierry Henry (left) and Ronaldo (right) became less potent as they reached their late-20s

Distant memories? Lionel Messi starred under Pep Guardiola but he has struggled a bit in the past year

Don’t mistake this for a criticism of Wayne. It isn’t. He has been a great player for United and has the honours to prove it. He has been very good for England, too, and is likely to break both the scoring and caps records held respectively by Sir Bobby Charlton and Peter Shilton.

But at the moment, questions are being asked of him, such as, ‘Does he deserve his place in the team?’ Rooney might not be at his best but in his last three England games he has scored twice and provided an assist. The time to ask whether he should still be picked is when he no longer contributes.

I would have played him in Switzerland on Monday night even before Daniel Sturridge was injured. Danny Welbeck, who had been suggested as an alternative to Rooney, has only eight goals in 27 games for England. Wayne has 41 - 31 of which have been in competitive games.

He might not be playing well but he still believes he will score whenever he does feature. He will still influence this England team, it just might not be as spectacularly as 10 years ago.

Scotland can upset the odds and catch Germany cold 

I had the privilege of watching Germany’s last competitive game from the stands and on Sunday I will be in the Sky studios when they begin qualifying for Euro 2016.

It doesn’t seem two months since Germany became world champions in the Maracana but that heady night against Argentina prompted a changing of the guard and it will be interesting to see how Scotland fare in Dortmund.

Gordon Strachan and his squad should be relishing this opportunity to take on Germany in Dortmund’s magnificent Westfalenstadion.

Nobody will be giving Scotland a hope of getting a result but maybe this is as good a time as any to face Germany.

Time to shine: Carragher believes Scotland can upset the odds and surprise world champions Germany 

Prize guys: (from left) Mario Gotze, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller won the World Cup earlier this summer

Since they beat Argentina, Philipp Lahm - their captain and best full back - has retired, as have their record-breaking striker Miroslav Klose and the Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker. Maybe Germany will not be as strong as they were in Brazil?

True, the midweek 4-2 defeat by Argentina might prompt a reaction from Joachim Low’s squad but Scotland have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Perhaps this could be the initial step that leads the Scots to a major tournament for the first time since 1998.

Once Germany get into their stride, they will win Group D but Scotland will be optimistic of finishing in front of the Republic of Ireland and Poland to take second place and secure a trip for the Tartan Army to France in two years’ time.

What I'm looking forward to this week...

Heading to my local ground to watch some authentic football.

With the Premier League taking a break because of international fixtures, I’m taking the opportunity to go to the Arriva Stadium with my son, James, to watch Marine v FC United of Manchester in the Evo-Stik League.

Given that it is a Liverpool-Manchester rivalry, I’ve no doubt that it will be fiercely competitive and, with luck, there should be a decent crowd, too.

If you’re like me, the last thing you will want to do on a Saturday afternoon is head to the shops!

Local football: Carragher hopes longer international intervals will get more fans attending non-league football

The international break has got me thinking, though.

The way the Euro 2016 qualifying fixtures are now spaced out means that non-League clubs are going to have an opportunity to attract spectators who wouldn’t usually go to their games.

Saturday is the annual Non-League Day. If communities made a conscious effort to go and give their local teams their backing, it would make a difference in safeguarding their futures.

Teams like Marine are proud of their history and heritage. Recently, Formby, another well-known Merseyside club, had to fold. If we all support Non-League Day, maybe in the future other clubs around the country will not suffer a similar fate.
