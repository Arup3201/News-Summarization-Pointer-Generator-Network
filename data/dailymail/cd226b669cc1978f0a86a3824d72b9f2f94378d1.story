Glamorous images of Hollywood stars and U.S. presidents found in the dusty filing cabinet of a British photographer are set to be exhibited for the first time.

Thousands of images, many in black and white, were unearthed at the Brighton home of George Douglas, after the photographer passed away.

The unique collection includes images of Breakfast At Tiffany's actress Audrey Hepburn, English actor Sir Dirk Bogarde as well as former U.S. president Harry Truman, James Bond star Roger Moore and Peter Sellers.

The images, which span three decades 
from the 1940s to 1960s, were discovered by fellow photographer and Mr 
Douglas's neighbour Roger Bamber, who inherited his friend's home 
following his death.

Thirty of the images are set to go on display for the first time in May as part of Brighton's Artists Open Houses event. This photograph of Angela Lansbury is part of the collection found in a dusty filing cabinet by Mr Douglas's friend and neighbour Roger Bamber

The negatives, which had lain buried for years, include social and historical images from the period, including the Queen's rat-catcher and Britain's first female chimney sweep, Mr Bamber said.

Thirty images from the archive will go on display at Mr Douglas's former home as part of Brighton's Artists Open Houses festival in May.

Photographer Nigel Swallow, who is now living in the property, said he is expecting it to take him at least a year for himself and Mr Bamber to sort through the photographs, and that he has taken advice as to how it can be properly archived.

Mr Swallow said: 'It's something that should be taken very good care of and I am chuffed that I have been asked to look after the archive.

'The first priority is making sure we preserve George's work.'

Mr Douglas, whose nickname was Speedy George due to his fast-paced work ethic, worked for many years at Picture Post magazine.

He spent much of his time in California, but would spend his summers in Brighton, Mr Bamber said.

He retired to live in his house full-time in 2007 until his death in December 2010 at the age of 88, he continued.

Mr Bamber 
said Mr Douglas, who was born in Rottingdean, East Sussex, but moved to 
Dallas, Texas, in 1939, trained in aeronautical design engineering but 
his heart was not in it.

He
 said: 'The Leica camera he bought from a pawnshop consumed his spare 
time and once he had sold his first picture, for 30 US dollars, he 
handed in his notice.

'He
 sold his first photographs to the Los Angeles Times in the 1940s and 
moved to Sun Valley, Idaho, in 1948, where he was in charge of 
photography for the Sun Valley News Bureau, taking pictures of famous 
visitors including Gary Cooper and President Harry Truman.

'In 1949 he moved back to LA and began his career as a celebrity photographer with a picture of Angela Lansbury for Life magazine.

'But it was an English magazine that intrigued him. He noticed that Life photographers he admired had trained in London on the Picture Post, which specialised in 35mm photography and a documentary style.

'He set off for England in 1950. A set of pictures of two children with their pet boa constrictor got him through the door and became the first of many assignments he undertook for Picture Post.

'He fell "more than a little in love" with Audrey Hepburn when he spent a fortnight photographing her in New York as she prepared for the Broadway production of Gigi, and became friends with the novelist Paul Gallico and the actor Peter Sellers.'

Picture Post closed in 1957 and George turned to women's magazines and the TV Mirror, Mr Bamber said.

He went on: 'In 1964, the Beatles asked him to become their photographer on the set of A Hard Day's Night.

'Paul McCartney had been impressed by George's portraits of his then girlfriend Jane Asher; but two weeks at the Twickenham Studios besieged by screaming teenagers was enough to persuade George that he was not cut out for pop photography.'
