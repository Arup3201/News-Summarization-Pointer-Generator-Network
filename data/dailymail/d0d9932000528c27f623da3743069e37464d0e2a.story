The leather goods and luxury stationer Smythson has employed Samantha Cameron as a part-time creative consultant since 2010 on a £100,000 salary

The Prime Minister was yesterday left embarrassed after facing questions about the fact the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife is based in a tax haven.

It comes after it emerged that Smythson is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in Guernsey, another tax haven.

The leather goods and luxury stationer, which has a store on New Bond Street that sells £2,000 python-skin handbags, has employed Samantha Cameron as a part-time creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, asked: ‘Does the Prime Minister know of anyone who owns or works for a UK-registered company that uses a Luxembourg-based holding company in order to avoid paying their fair share of tax in the UK?’

Mr Cameron ignored the implied reference to his wife, saying: ‘We inherited a situation where company after company was leaving our shores. 

'Because we have now got competitive tax rates and a business friendly government, more and more businesses are coming here.’

Smythson’s tax arrangements are a major embarrassment for Mr Cameron. 

Recently he warned that businesses setting up ‘ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad’ should ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ – a jibe aimed at Starbucks, which has paid only small sums of tax in the UK.

Smythson is owned and run by secretive Egypt-born Frenchman Jacques Bahbout, who bought the label for £18 million in 2009 through his Italian handbag manufacturer Tivoli Group. 

Since Bahbout bought the business, the holding company Holdsmyth has paid around £1.06 million in corporation tax. 

But over the same period, £1 million in dividends paid out may have benefited from the tax status of Guernsey and Luxembourg.

Controversy over its tax affairs has been more intense because the company has previously borrowed £2 million under the National Loan Guarantee Scheme, a taxpayer-backed initiative for banks to provide small firms with cheap finance, and it currently has a £5 million credit facility which is classed as ‘state aid’.

There is no suggestion that Smythson has done anything illegal. It has declined to comment on its tax status.

The firm’s annual accounts filed at Companies House show Holdsmyth is owned by ‘a company incorporated in Luxembourg’ and is ultimately controlled by ‘Ogier Trustee (Jersey) Ltd as trustees of the Barracuda Trust, a trust settled in Guernsey’.

Mrs Cameron was creative director of Smythson before taking on the consultancy role.
