Jose Mourinho appears to have a happy camp on his hands ahead of Chelsea's Wembley showdown with Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday.

The Portuguese boss split his players into two teams as they worked on ball skills, as well as an extra tactical session at the Cobham training centre.

Mourinho, who last won the competition eight years ago, told the media on Friday that he is trying to bring his new generation through with a mentality that playing at Wembley is 'normal', and hopes they show no fear against Mauricio Pochettino's side.

'Chelsea in the last 10 years won the League Cup twice. Many times they were at Wembley, winning FA Cups, and won Premier League and European competitions,' he said. 'Chelsea have done very well.'

'Now, with a new team and people who were not with dozens of finals at Wembley, we will try and bring this new generation of players and this new team to make Wembley something "normal" for us, "normal" in the sense that we will try and get there year after year.'

It certainly seemed to be working, as Chelsea squad looked in relaxed spirits at training.

Mourinho has revealed that Nemanja Matic (suspended) and John Obi Mikel (injured) will be the only two absentees against a Tottenham side that beat the Blues 5-3 in their last encounter.

Many Premier League sides, especially near the top of the table, often somewhat disregard the competition and play weakened sides, but Mourinho is fully focused on another trophy and insists he respects the competition. 

He added: 'I have affinities with every competition. I respect every competition. It would be easy now because we lost against Bradford to say we didn't take the FA seriously, but we did. 

'Probably lots of teams follow us since 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 when we took the League Cup as a real competition, a real challenge, and we were trying to reach finals and to win. 

'For sure, lots of clubs are chasing us. In the semi-final against Liverpool a couple of months ago, we and Liverpool played at the maximum of our potential. We respect every competition.'

Ramires is expected to replace Matic in a holding midfield role, with Diego Costa will be looking to return to form up front.
