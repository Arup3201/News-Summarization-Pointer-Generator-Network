Barcelona coach Luis Enrique says he’s not worried about the club’s transfer ban and there was an indication of why on Tuesday night as the kids beat Huesca 8-1 in the Copa del Rey.

Local press lauded the performance as if it were against one of Europe's big guns and not a side from Spain’s third tier who were already 4-0 down from the first leg, but all the same 45,000 in the Nou Camp will still have taken huge encouragement from the display. 

Here’s Sportsmail’s lowdown on Barca’s next generation, with our prediction on their chances of making it to the first team.

Barcelona youngsters (from left to right) Munir El Haddadi, Marc Bartra, Sandro Ramirez, Rafinha, Jordi Masip, Sergi Roberto, Adama Traore, Sergi Samper, Diawandou Diagne, Martin Montoya along with Pedro

Jordi Masip

Age 25

Played in goal on Tuesday night but couldn’t keep a clean sheet and it could have been two when Juan Esnaider hit the frame of the goal with a header.

Good back-up for Luis Enrique if both his goalkeepers get injured but with Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen ahead of him the path to the first team looks permanently blocked.

Chances of breaking through: 4

Jordi Masip's route to the first team looks permanently blocked with two top class goalkeepers in front of him

Martin Montoya

Age 23

Picked by Vicente del Bosque for the senior squad four years ago but has since stagnated and has not seen eye to eye with Luis Enrique this season. Got a rare start against Huesca and played well. 

Wants first team football but despite limited options at right back Barca don’t seem to want to give him the chance. Will leave in January.

Chances of breaking through 5 (9 once he’s gone to another club)

Martin Montoya will leave in January and has the quality to succeed elsewhere at right back

Sergi Samper

Age 19

The next Sergio Busquets. Could play the position in his sleep and has already made his Champions League debut. Ran the game on Tuesday against Huesca and will crave more chances in the second half of the season. 

Having Busquets ahead of him makes things tough but he has the quality to succeed at the Nou Camp without question.

Chances of breaking through 9

Sergi Samper looks set to be the next Sergio Busquets - he could play the holding position in his sleep

Sergi Roberto

Age 22

Scored and assisted on Tuesday night making the most of a rare start. There is no shortage of opportunity for him at the Nou Camp because Barca have so few options playing in his midfield position.

Pep Guardiola was a big fan but he has stood still in the last couple of seasons and is no longer young enough to be able to accept playing so few games. 

It’s telling that when scouts come to watch Barcelona’s youngsters these days they come for Samper not Roberto.

Chances of breaking through 6

Sergi Roberto has a chance because of the postition he operates in but Samper is also highly rated

Munir El Haddadi

Age 19

Has shot up through the ranks and looked at home in the first team at the start of the season while Barcelona were waiting for Luis Suarez to finish his ban. 

Frustrated not to score on Tuesday night but was instrumental in most of Barca's best football. No questioning his quality.

Del Bosque has already used him to ensure he plays for Spain not Morocco (the country of his father). Only the wealth of attacking riches already in the Barcelona first team will stop him making it. 

Ajax wanted him on loan this season. Other clubs may ask in January but are likely to be turned down.

Chances of breaking through 8

Munir El Haddadi shot up the ranks this season and was unfortunate not to score against Huesca

Sandro

Age 19

Most of what can be said about Munir applies to Sandro. He scored on Tuesday night in a fine second-half display and has already found the net for the first team getting the goal that saw off Villarreal earlier in the season.

Is also in that queue behind Messi, Neymar, Suarez and Pedro so other clubs are watching his progress closely.

Chances of breaking through 8

Sandro Ramirez has had a similar breakthrough to Munir but could struggle for first team opportunities

Douglas

Age 24

Made his first start at the Camp Nou on Tuesday after a £4.4m move from Sao Paolo in the summer. Looks a million miles from the level needed to be a Barcelona full back.

Always chooses the safe option when in possession and lacks the ability and confidence to overlap with any purpose, even against third-tier opposition as was the case on Tuesday.

Chances of breaking through 3

Douglas looks a million miles from the level needed to be a Barcelona full-back

Adama Traore

Age 18

In terms of raw talent it’s all there: the speed, the power, the aggression, the audacity. His goal summed up what a prospect he is. 

Time will tell, whether, when surrounded by better players he also has the decision-making skills to reach his potential but everyone at Barcelona is very excited. 

Barca's only problem is that their four best youngsters (Samper, Munir, Sandro and Adama) play in positions already well covered.

Chances of breaking through 9 

Adama Traore's raw talent was obvious for everyone to see at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night

Barcelona beat third-tier side Huesca 8-1 at the Nou Camp on Tuesday

Sandro, Munir, Adama Traore and Sergi Samper among those to impress

But will they rise to the top from La Masia like Lionel Messi
