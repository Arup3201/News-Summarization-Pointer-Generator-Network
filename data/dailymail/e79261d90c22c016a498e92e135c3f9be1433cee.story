David Cameron and Nick Clegg have begun secret talks about a second coalition after the next election, a new book claimed last night.

The two men are said to have discussed the idea ‘from time to time’ over the past year, amid mounting speculation that the 2015 election could result in another hung parliament.

Mr Clegg is said to have told Mr Cameron privately that he would be reluctant to go into government with Labour leader Ed Miliband – despite claiming in public that he would be happy to negotiate with whoever has the most MPs after the election.

Second term? David Cameron and Nick Clegg are said to have discussed setting up another Coalition

The claims, which were denied by Downing Street last night, are made in a new book by journalist Matthew d’Ancona, who has enjoyed privileged access to the Conservative leadership before and after the last election.

The revelation that Mr Cameron is considering a second coalition will infuriate many of his MPs, who believe the Lib Dems have neutered the Government and frustrated tough action on welfare, immigration and tax.

Many MPs – and some ministers – would rather see the Conservatives try to operate as a minority government if they fall short of an overall majority in 2015.

The Prime Minister is said to have told Mr Clegg that, unlike in 2010, he would need the active consent of his party before a second deal could be signed off.

Mr d’Ancona writes: ‘From time to time, he (Mr Cameron) would raise the question of a second coalition with Clegg. “If we did it again,” he mused to the Deputy Prime Minister, “I’d have to seek collective permission”.’

No 10 flatly rejected Mr d’Ancona’s claim that talks on a second coalition were under way.

A spokesman said: ‘There are not, nor have there been any plans or talks to form a new coalition post-2015. The Prime Minister is entirely focused on running the country.’

Nevertheless, Mr Cameron is likely to be confronted over the claims at the Conservative Party conference.

The book also claims that Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s mercurial strategy chief, walked out after concluding that he was a ‘reactive, not transformative Prime Minister’.
