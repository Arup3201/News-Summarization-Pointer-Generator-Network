Aykroyd said he would match the donations that were coming in for the Officer Robert Wilson III Family Memorial Trust Fund, which was set up on Friday by Wilson's colleagues for his two sons including a one-year-old, that he left behind, according to CBS Philly. 

'Encourage listeners to step up and I’m going to match the contributions that are coming, and I’ll be talking to our corporate office in Toronto to make sure that happens next week,' said Aykroyd.

Wilson is also survived by his wife, according to My Fox Philly.

Brothers Williams and Hipps were both charged with murder and attempted murder following Wilson's death.

On Saturday, Williams was arraigned while Hipps remains hospitalized, and his condition has not been released.

The ordeal happened while Wilson (pictured above), dressed in full uniform, was in the store to purchase a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades, and whose birthday is on Monday

The ordeal resulting in Wilson's death happened while the officer, dressed in full uniform, was in the gaming store this week to purchase a video game for his son who had recently earned good grades, and whose birthday is also on Monday.

The brothers entered the store and announced a robbery before Wilson immediately confronted the suspects.

The three men exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters.

Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, said Ramsey.

Aykroyd said: 'Encourage listeners to step up and I’m going to match the contributions that are coming, and I’ll be talking to our corporate office in Toronto to make sure that happens next week'

A surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. 

'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters. 'He fought to the end.'

Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, according to NBC.

During the incident, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store.

Police said both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting.

Fellow officers have showed their support for Wilson and his heroic act and service. Edward M. Fidler wrote on Twitter (above): 'Very proud to be part of this profession. I haven't seen any that rose above what I saw on that video

Officer John Stanford wrote: 'Robert Wilson III thank you for your service and sacrifice. You will never be forgotten young brother (above the Twitter post)

Other people who have been touched by Wilson's story have come together to raise funds including a gaming community in California.

Paul Punla, a blogger, video game dealer and collector from San Diego started a fundraising page on YouCaring calling on fellow gamers to unite and donate to the fund for Wilson's sons, according to NBC Philadelphia. 

Punla's fund is aimed to raise $1,000 but so far has only collected $230 in donations.

'Nowadays gamers are labeled as lonesome and selfish individuals and I want to change that assumption,' said Punla. 'The ultimate goal is to simply help a family in need.'
