Graeme Souness has torn into the Manchester City squad in the wake of their Champions League loss to CSKA Moscow, claiming the players 'are not world class'.

City went a goal down early on, and despite a fantastic free-kick from Yaya Toure, suffered a disappointing 2-1 loss to put their chances of qualifying for the knock-out stages in serious jeopardy.

Speaking after the match on Sky Sports, Souness said: 'A short few months ago we were talking about these players being world class but we can tell now that they're not world class because world class players respond and these players have been found wanting.'

'You get the early warning and after that you get yourself back into it, you think it's going to be one way.

'But they were second to everything. There's no argument - the best team won tonight regardless of the sendings off.'

Manchester City now have to host Bayern Munich in their next European fixture, before travelling to Rome in their final game, where it is certain they will have to produce a result to qualify.
