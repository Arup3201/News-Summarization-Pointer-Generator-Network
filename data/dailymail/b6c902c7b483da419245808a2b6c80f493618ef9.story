Awful: Father-of-two Aji Joseph has been killed after being knocked down by a rickshaw in India - where he had travelled to attend his own father's funeral

A British father-of-two has died in a head-on rickshaw collision during a trip to India where he was attending his father's funeral.

Aji Vengalil Joseph, 43, sustained catastrophic head injuries when he was flung from the three-wheeled taxi as it smashed into another rickshaw.

The vehicle landed on him and he was left in a coma for 17 days before he died.

The accident happened the day before he was due to return home to Swindon, Wiltshire, after his father's funeral in Kerala, south west India.

Friend Roy Stephen said: 'It just collided and he was thrown out of the auto. The rickshaw fell on him.

'After the accident happened they took him to the hospital but I was told he actually walked from the ambulance into casualty.

'The hospital initially felt that the bleeding was less, so were pleased not to have an operation, but after one or two days he did not get better and they chose to operate.

'They then saw there was a vein broken in his brain and it became too dangerous to re-operate. It was then after two or three days the doctors said that he was brain dead.'

The smash happened on July 3 after Mr Joseph and his brother had returned a rented car to the town of Kallara, a small town in the Kottayam district of Kerala.

They were returning to the village of Eravimangalam, where his father's funeral had taken place.Mr Joseph was taken to Kerala Medical College & Hospital, where doctors discovered bleeding on his brain as a result of the head trauma.

He was transferred to a specialist private Indo-American Hospital in nearby Vaikom, where he underwent a make-or-break operation which sadly failed and he died on July 20.

His funeral took place on July 22 in Eravimangalam and was attended by thousands of relatives, friends and neighbours.

Mr Stephen, president of the Wiltshire Malayalee Association and a friend of Aji, said: 'It was very sad. From that day onwards we had prayers every day in different houses in the community.

'He was a very friendly person. A calm and friendly person.

'He was a cool person who was always very cautious - he would think for the answer and didn't always immediately react.'

Mr Joseph was a keen badminton and cricket player who worked in the Gulf before moving to Swindon in 2002. He became a British citizen and worked as an engineer for Honda.

He was a talented drummer and a member of a music group that play Chenda - a traditional form of Indian folk music.

Mr Joseph leaves behind wife Tessy Aji, and sons, Jetto, 13 and eight-year-old Jake.
