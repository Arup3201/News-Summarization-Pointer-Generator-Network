He revelled in his nickname as the Devil’s Advocate for offering to represent some of the world’s most evil men.

Giovanni Di Stefano bragged of meetings with Osama bin Laden, Robert Mugabe and Serbian warlord Arkan as he travelled the globe.

Among his clients were road rage killer Kenneth Noye, timeshare fraudster John ‘Goldfinger’ Palmer and slum landlord Nicholas van Hoogstraten.

No ordinary lawyer: Giovanni di Stefano built up a reputation for defending the seemingly indefensible. Now he has been convicted on 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering

But the flamboyant 57-year-old Italian
self-styled ‘avvocato’, or advocate, failed to mention to any of them 
that he had no legal qualifications.

The closest he came was a ‘doctorate 
of law’ from the University of Belgrade handed to him by brutal Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic – whom Di Stefano once called ‘a lovely man’.

Yesterday, his high-flying career came
crashing down to earth when he was convicted of deception, fraud, money
laundering and forgery between 2004 and 2012.

Now Di Stefano faces years behind bars
after a London jury found him guilty of duping a  string of clients out
of almost £1million.

Giovanni di Stefano has represented some of Britain's most notorious criminals

Giovanni Di Stefano acted for Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland, a career Irish criminal, best known for being the first person accused of killing Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, which he denied until his death

The convictions finally expose  the 
Italian as a liar and fantasist who lured the rich, powerful and 
notorious into his web of deceit. He attracted worldwide publicity for 
his outrageous bids to defend war criminals and serial killers, even 
claiming he would represent Adolf Hitler if he could.

Di Stefano travelled to war zones including Iraq and Serbia, preying on political instability and the egos of wealthy tyrants.

Born in a village in Italy, he moved 
to Britain as a child and grew up to make a dishonest living by offering
to ‘defend the indefensible’ in his broad Cockney accent. He also 
entered into a series of bizarre business ventures and was briefly a 
director of Dundee FC in 2003.

At one stage he claimed to be worth 
£450million. For years Di Stefano successfully dodged questions about 
his qualifications. But the authorities finally caught up with him at 
his holiday villa in Majorca in February 2011 when he was arrested 
pending extradition.

The two-month trial at Southwark Crown Court heard how  Di Stefano ripped off a string  of clients.

The court was told his victims 
included the wife of convicted killer Paul Bush, jailed for life at the 
Old Bailey for murder, who paid him £10,000 to try to get her husband 
bail.

Others lost money when Di Stefano took
their money and did little or almost no legal work in return. In his 
defence, he admitted he was not a qualified lawyer but said he thought 
he could still help people and surrounded himself with a top legal team.

After his conviction he tweeted: ‘It’s not and never will be the last of me, today was a loss but, there is always tomorrow!’

The conman, of Canterbury, has two 
previous convictions for dishonesty, in 1976 and 1986 under the name 
John Di Stefano. He was convicted yesterday of 25 offences and will be 
sentenced today.
