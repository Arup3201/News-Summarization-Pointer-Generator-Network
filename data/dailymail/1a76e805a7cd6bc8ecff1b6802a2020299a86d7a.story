Furious: Susan Tanner, 37, was kicked off a Stagecoach bus with her two children because her 15-month-old toddler, Tommy (above), was crying

A mother and her two children were heartlessly thrown off a Stagecoach bus because her 15-month-old toddler would not stop crying.

Susan Tanner, 37, caught the bus with her youngest son, Tommy, and his six-year-old brother, Frankie, from their home in New Romney, Kent.

She was planning to take the 35-minute journey to Folkestone so that she could buy clothes for her eldest son ahead of his first day at school next week.

But when her youngest, Tommy, began to bawl two miles from the family's intended destination, the driver decided he had heard enough and kicked them off the bus and on to the street.

Miss Tanner is furious about the incident and claimed: 'The driver said "Do you need some time out?" I asked what he meant.

'He then said "Do you need to get off the bus because the baby is crying?" 

'I said no, and I asked the other passengers if the baby was disturbing them. None of them said so.

'The driver then said "It's disturbing me and I would like you to get off the bus".

'Frankie was so upset because he didn't understand why his mum was thrown off the bus.

'I am still in shock. I couldn't believe it.'

After being ditched in Sandgate village, just five minutes drive from Folkestone, Miss Tanner was forced to call her partner for a lift - despite the fact that she had already paid £6.40 in bus fares.

After eventually being dropped off in Folkestone, the mother-of-two marched straight to the bus station to complain - only to be told she would have to sit and fill out a complaint form if she wanted to get a refund.

A Stagecoach spokesman said the driver's action was strongly against company policy.

He said: 'We were very concerned to hear about this incident.

Stranded: After being thrown from the Stagecoach bus (like the one pictured), Miss Tanner had to call her partner for a lift 

'We have carried out an investigation to find out what happened and can confirm that one of our drivers suggested Ms Tanner alight the bus.

'This is definitely not part of any company procedure or policy and we would like to offer Miss Tanner our sincere apologies for our driver's actions.

'We will take appropriate action to prevent this from ever happening again.

'We have not yet received Ms Tanner's formal complaint, but when we do we will reiterate this apology to her directly.'

It is not the first time Stagecoach has received complaints over its treatment of passengers.

In August, a mother from Cardiff claimed that one of their drivers refused to help her find a seat for her toddler, who has cerebral palsy - despite her explaining his condition.

Alisha Frost, 24, was forced to sit on the floor while holding her brain damaged son, Jack, in her arms.
