A bus driver who tried to help a pensioner get back in her house by climbing up to her window plunged to his death after the ladder gave way.

Father-of-three David Alden, 43, clambered up the side of the two-storey property because his elderly neighbour had been locked out.

But his ladder suddenly toppled over and was left clinging desperately to a parapet.

Tragic accident: David Alden fell from his ladder when he was trying to help a pensioner who was locked out of her house on Church Street in Paignton, Devon (pictured)

Despite his frantic attempts to hold on the structure was too rotten to hold his weight and gave way.

Married Mr Alden, of Paignton, Devon, fell to the ground and landed on his feet, but then fell backwards and struck his head on a metal grate.

He was taken to hospital with severe head injuries after the tragic accident early on Sunday morning but was pronounced dead when his life-support machine was switched off.

His family have also revealed his organs were donated and could save 12 people's lives around the country.

Mr Alden’s wife Theresa said: 'We have been told he went to help somebody who was locked out of her flat. That’s just the sort of thing he would do.

'He was a hero. He had always wanted to join the fire brigade and did a training course in a year or so ago.'

Mr Alden’s mother-in-law Mary Bennett added: 'He was trying to climb up a ladder to get into an open window for an elderly lady who was locked out of her flat.

'The parapet which was rotten gave way and he hit the ground, sustaining a massive fracture and brain injury.'

'The ladder fell sideways and he was hanging onto the parapet, but the wood was all rotten and it collapsed. He
landed on his feet on an incline and fell backwards, hitting his head 
on a metal grating. It’s typical of David that he went to help somebody' 

Mrs Bennett said a friend of the family witnessed the 5.30am fall on her way to work.

She went on: 'The ladder fell sideways and he was hanging onto the parapet, but the wood was all rotten and it collapsed.

'He landed on his feet on an incline and fell backwards, hitting his head on a metal grating. It’s typical of David that he went to help somebody.'

Mr Alden, who has children named Lucy, Vicky and James, had been living in Sidcup, Kent, but returned to Paignton eight weeks ago.

His family described him as 'a popular, sociable man known to many from his days driving the No.12 bus in Torbay'.

They revealed Mr Alden’s organs have been donated to save others.

Mrs Bennett added: 'David’s organs were donated to save, we are told, at least 12 other people’s lives across the country. We were told that his heart and lungs went to save a young person.

'He will forever be missed by his wife Theresa and his three beautiful children.'

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they received a call from a woman who was locked out of her flat.

A police spokesman said: 'It appears he tried to climb through a window to help someone get into a property they had been locked out of, and he fell.'
