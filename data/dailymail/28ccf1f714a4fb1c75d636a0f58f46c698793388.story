Craft too small to carry enough explosives and too tricky to fly

Charged: Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, who is accused of plotting to attack the Pentagon and Capitol with remote-controlled aircraft filled with explosives.

The man accused of plotting to attack the Pentagon and the US Capitol using remote-controlled planes filled with explosive would not have inflicted major damage, say experts.

University graduate Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, was arrested in Framingham, Massachussets, on Wednesday and also charged with attempting to provide support and resources to al Qaeda with a view to attacking US soldiers stationed overseas.

The FBI said Rezwan Ferdaus hoped to use replica military jets up to seven and a half feet long, guided by GPS devices and capable of flying at 100 mph.

But counter-terrorism experts and 
model-aircraft hobbyists said it would be nearly impossible to inflict 
large-scale damage using model planes as they are too small, can't carry
enough explosives and are too tricky to fly.

'The idea of pushing a button and this thing diving into the Pentagon is kind of a joke, actually,' said Greg Hahn, technical director of the Academy of Model Aeronautics.

Rick Nelson, a former Navy helicopter
pilot and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said Ferdaus would have had to hit a window or other 
vulnerable area to maximise damage, and that would have taken precision 
flying.

'Flying a remote-controlled plane isn't 
as easy as it actually looks, and then to put an explosive on it and 
have that explosive detonate at the time and place that you want it add 
to the difficulty of actually doing it,' he said.

Ferdaus, a Muslim US citizen from 
Ashland, Massachussets, was arrested after federal agents posing as al Qaeda members delivered what he believed was 24lb of C-4 explosive, 
authorities said.

He was charged with attempting to damage or destroy a federal building with explosives. A federal affidavit claims he began planning 'jihad' against the US in early 2010 after becoming convinced through jihadi websites and videos that America was evil.

Ferdaus had a physics degree from Northeastern University and enjoyed 'taking stuff apart' and 'learning on my own,' according to court papers.

He reportedly had the nickname 'Bollywood' and played 
drums in a Massachusetts band, according to CBS.

The model planes Ferdaus intended to use were scaled-down versions of an F-4 Phantom and an F-86 Sabre, which cost up to $20,000 and $10,000 respectively, said investigators.

Ferdaus's plan, as alleged in court papers, was to launch three such planes from a park near the Pentagon and Capitol and use GPS to direct them toward the buildings, where they would detonate on impact.

He planned to pack five pounds of plastic explosive on each plane, said prosecutors.

James Crippin, an explosives and anti-terrorism expert, said that much C-4 could do serious damage â€” a half-pound will obliterate a car. But he said getting a stable explosive like C-4 to blow up at the right time would have been hugely difficult.

And there were slim prospects of causing any serious damage to buildings like the Pentagon and Capitol, which are undoubtedly hardened to withstand explosions, according to Crippin, director of the Western Forensic Law Enforcement Training Center.

'Basically, I think he's suffering from delusions of grandeur,' he said.Greg Hahn said the heavier of the two models Ferdaus was allegedly planning to use could carry a maximum of two pounds of plastic explosive before malfunctioning.

'That's not including the weight of any GPS system,' he added. 'It's almost impossible for him to get this done.'

Suburban idyll: The house in Ashland, Massachussets, where Rezwan Ferdaus lives with his family

After September 11, 2001, federal agents asked the Academy of Model Aeronautics' 143,000 members to watch for any fellow enthusiasts who might be buying planes with bad intentions.

The Federal Aviation Administration is devising new rules for model airplanes and other unmanned aircraft, but the restrictions are aimed primarily at preventing collisions. Under current FAA rules, such planes are generally limited to flying below 400ft and away from airports and air traffic.

Massachusetts prosecutor Gerry Leone, who handled the prosecution of would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid, said terrorists are always building bombs out of common, legitimate items, and imposing restrictions on buying model aircraft would not make sense simply because of this one case.

But he said law enforcement might want be more vigilant about such purchases.

Similarly, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said recent advances in model aircraft technology could make them more attractive to terrorists, but he agreed that the answer is better intelligence.

'Kids have them, people fly them, groups are organised just to engage in this type of pastime activity,' said Mr Mica.

'It would be almost impossible to regulate.'
