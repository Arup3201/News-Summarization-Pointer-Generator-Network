The departure of the Greatest Ever Ranger caused real concern. The decision by his old gaffer to walk away then definitely started the alarm bells ringing. When former team-mate Ally McCoist decided he could no longer serve under the current board, Stuart McCall became convinced that all hope was lost.

‘Imagine Bobby Charlton at Man United saying: “You know what? I’ve had enough of the club”,’ said the former Ibrox midfielder.

‘Then Sir Alex Ferguson departing because something was going on — and then Ryan Giggs leaving. If that happened at Man United, imagine how everyone would react. They’d be asking: “What is going on?”.

‘At Rangers, we’ve had Walter Smith, Coisty and John Greig walking out. That’s what would worry me. What is going on in there?

‘Yeah, football is a business now. But is there anybody in there actually doing it for the sake of the club?

‘Or are they just in to make a few quid then disappear into the night? Over the past few years, that has been the case.

‘John Greig stayed away, which for me is hard to get my head round. Walter left the board and, again, alarm bells started ringing. If Walter is walking away when you need somebody there, it must be bad. You know that, for him to go, he must have had his reasons.

‘For John Greig not to be there means stuff must be going on that people can’t quite see. Obviously, the great Sandy Jardine passed away, unfortunately. And now Coisty is away. So there are four great Rangers men who have departed the club.’

McCall is, like all with Rangers at heart, greatly saddened by the continued struggles of a club gifted tens of millions of pounds by supporters who believed in ‘the journey’ from a starting point at the bottom of the senior game.

Like anyone with an interest in or knowledge of football as a business, he remains suspicious of the moves and motives that have led Rangers to the brink of insolvency.

The Rangers board considered mortgaging off Ibrox  in return for a £10million loan from Mike Ashley

‘Rangers are possibly in an even worse state now than they were when they went down to the bottom tier,’ he said. ‘What has gone on off the park at Rangers for the last three years, as a supporter, player, manager or part of the coaching staff — I speak to the coaching staff — you just don’t know what is going to happen next or who you can trust.

‘A new guy comes in and it’s: “Oh yeah, great, he’s going to put money in.”. Then that falls flat and somebody else goes in, all while there is money going out of the club.

‘There has been a whole load of mismanagement off the park, I think that’s plain for everyone to see.

‘Listen, I think Rangers going into administration and going down to the bottom tier was a boot in the b***s. A big setback.

One of the supporter's flags read: 'Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites'

‘But even then people thought: “Right, they’ve bottomed out, they can build again, build up”. And it’s just not happened.

‘People couldn’t believe Rangers were getting 45,000 or whatever against Elgin City and the like. So the support stood by them and remained steadfast as they rolled through the bottom two divisions.

‘But, when you get to this stage, you have to be ready for it. If the club had been managed properly, they would have been able to go back into the top flight and be stronger.

‘It’s just been one calamity after another. People coming in, then leaving. I think the fans put in about £20million — and now they need so many million just to survive.

‘Not just Rangers fans, any fan of football would be asking: “How can that be so? Where has that money gone?”.

Those fans are now in open revolt against the current regime, with elements of Friday night’s demonstration outside Ibrox turning violent as some tried to gain access to club offices.

McCall said: ‘I think the other night was just everything coming to a head. That’s why there was such a big demonstration.

‘Obviously, you don’t condone any violence, although I don’t think there was much of that, to be fair. Protest is OK.

‘The thing that really brought it to a head was finding out the ground was going to be put up as security on a loan, the board having told everyone at the last AGM that this would never happen. The fans have had enough.

‘I think the fans would come back, no doubt. I don’t think there is a case of generations of fans being lost.

‘They went to the fourth tier and still got 45,000 fans, 30,000 in the third tier. Rangers have fans across the world and are a huge brand, even though people don’t perceive that just now.

‘It would be a silly thing to say just now, but they still have support across the world. It goes hand in hand, it also needs to be done on the park.

‘There is no reason that Rangers can’t be playing top flight next year. If they get there, will more money be ploughed into the club? Would more investors be interested?

‘I’m sure there would be and supporters won’t turn their backs on Rangers. There are people there who will always be there.’

Although McCall feels promotion is a possibility, he accepts that it will have to come via the play-offs. And that’s assuming the emergency sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford is the last cut-price departure during this transfer window.

With one eye on the Old Firm League Cup semi-final to come, the former Scotland midfielder said: ‘No disrespect to Brentford because they are flying in the Championship, but it shows how far Rangers have slipped.

‘Looking to the game with Celtic, Rangers cannot afford to lose any more players before then, that is for sure.’
