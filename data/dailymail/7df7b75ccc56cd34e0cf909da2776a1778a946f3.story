A UK oil and gas company has abandoned exploration in Africa's oldest national park after it came under intense pressure from conservationists.

London-based exploration company Soco International is ending its operations in the Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is home to critically endangered mountain gorillas.

The move, which comes after a sustained campaign by environmentalists to stop oil exploration in the World Heritage site, was hailed as a 'victory for our planet' by wildlife charity WWF.

More than 700,000 people signed a petition to protect the Virunga park (pictured) from oil exploration

The company yesterday committed not to commission any exploratory or drilling within the park unless World Heritage body Unesco and the DRC government agreed to back such activities.

It has also committed to staying out of other World Heritage sites. The company will end operations after completing a survey of Lake Edward, which is due to conclude shortly, it said.

The national park is made up of lakes, savannah, forests, volcanoes and is home to rare wildlife including the critically endangered mountain gorilla, but 85 per cent of the park has been allocated to oil concessions.

Unesco has called for the oil exploration permits to be cancelled and for energy companies not to drill in World Heritage sites.

The park is home to around half of the world's 950 remaining mountain gorillas

David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: 'Today is a victory for our planet. Congolese people around Virunga were joined by scientists and lawyers, activists and artists, governments, investors and WWF supporters worldwide to remove the immediate threat of oil exploration.

'Now is the time for the government of the DRC to reaffirm its conviction that Virunga has outstanding universal value for all humanity - by cancelling all oil concessions which overlap the park, as requested by Unesco.'

WWF had filed a complaint against Soco under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises and tyesterday's statement followed mediation between the two parties under the process.

Ed Story, chief executive of Soco, said: 'Today's public commitment adds further definition and transparency to the company's approach regarding Virunga National Park and other World Heritage sites.'

Mr Story added: 'Hopefully we can all get back to activities focused on both people and the environment where it does the most good for a place that we think can have a better future.'

The licence did not include the mountainous sector of the park, which is home to the mountain gorillas, and the company had already stated it would never seek to have operations in the gorilla habitat, the Virunga volcanoes or rainforest.

But WWF warned that the work could still damage wildlife, and lead to oil spills, pipeline leaks and gas flaring which could contaminate air, water and soil in the local environment.

The environmental campaign was backed by businessman Sir Richard Branson, Archbishop Desmond Tuti and the British government.

It was also feared development of oil resources in the troubled region could fuel further conflict, as minerals form the main source of export revenue and could be targeted by rebels for finance.
