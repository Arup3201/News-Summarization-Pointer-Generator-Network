Lexi Thompson hit the golf course with former Aston Villa player John Carew on Friday as the pair played a few holes together.

The 19-year-old champion golfer Thompson shared a photo of the two via Instagram, an unusual gift for the ex-Norway international player, who was celebrating his 35th birthday.

Carew took a less subtle approach, showing off his golf swing in a video he captioned ‘The #330Yards Golf Swing’.

Odd couple: Thompson posted a picture of the pair on their round together in Norway

Thompson is in Norway to compete in the Suzann pro challenge held in Oslo. She will represent the USA team as they take on the Europeans tomorrow.

A win for the USA team would add to Thompson’s already mounting accolades. 

Target man: Carew scored 37 league goals at Villa Park as well as having spells with West Ham and Stoke

Fun time: Thompson said on Instagram that she had 'enjoyed playing a few holes with @john_carew today'

She is the second youngest women’s major winner to date after her fourth LPGA win at the Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this year.

It has been a busy 2014 for the Florida girl, who also featured in a Puma campaign alongside Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt and Italian soccer star Mario Balotelli.
