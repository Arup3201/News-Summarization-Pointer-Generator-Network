The mother of a gifted young ballerina who threw herself under a train demanded action yesterday against the ‘toxic digital world’ of the internet that glamorises suicide and self-harm.

Tallulah Wilson, 15, had been hooked on photo-sharing websites, where users encouraged her to harm herself.

The privately-educated schoolgirl – who had created a fantasy cocaine-taking online character – killed herself at London’s St Pancras station in October 2012.

Talented: Tallulah Wilson was a promising dancer who had been 'headhunted' by the Royal Ballet

Yesterday, after the inquest into her 
death ended, her mother Sarah Wilson issued a statement urging websites 
to do more to protect vulnerable youngsters.

She
 asked companies to withdraw advertising from those sites which  
‘continue to host inappropriate self-harming and suicide-promoting 
blogs’ to ‘stop this poison spreading’.

Mrs
 Wilson said she was horrified when she discovered pictures of her 
daughter self-harming on the blogging website, Tumblr, and the family 
had tried to protect her.

‘We have lost someone more precious than words
 could ever say – a beautiful, loving and talented shining star has been
 stolen from our skies,’ she said.

‘Her sisters and I did everything we could to keep her safe, but she had fallen into a world of nightmares.

‘She was in the clutches of a toxic digital world where in the final few weeks we could no longer reach her.’

Mrs
 Wilson, who had desperately tried to keep her troubled daughter off the
 websites, added: ‘I was shocked by the ease with which Tallulah and 
other children can access online self-harm blogs.

‘Tallulah
 entered a world where the lines between fantasy and reality became 
blurred. It is every parent’s worst nightmare.

Torment: The teenager moved from St Marylebone School in Westminster after 'bullying' claims

'I believe the likes of 
Tumblr should do more to protect other vulnerable young people from the 
insidious aspects of the internet; they need to take an active role in 
policing and swiftly removing unsuitable material as some sites already 
do.’

Tallulah, the youngest
 of three girls whose parents are divorced, lived with her family in a 
£1million house in West Hampstead, North-West London.

She had a bright 
future and had been head-hunted by the Royal Ballet School.

St
 Pancras Coroner Mary Hassell said she would write a ‘prevention of 
further death report’ for the Department of Health and other government 
agencies after the inquest jury highlighted the need for a ‘better 
understanding’ of online media.

The jury delivered a narrative verdict.

During
 the inquest, Miss Hassell described two sides of Tallulah. One was a 
talented horse rider and a ‘confident, lively, engaged, lovely-looking 
girl’, the other was a troubled teenager who suffered from 
self-loathing.

The inquest 
heard she had become addicted to the internet and created a fantasy 
character to escape reality but she ‘spiralled out of control’ and 
became obsessed with her online persona.

Days
 before Tallulah’s death, her mother found out that she had created the 
online persona and gained 18,000 followers after posting about drinking 
and taking cocaine and uploading pictures of herself with cuts she had 
made in order to impress her fans.

Mrs
 Wilson wept as she told the court: ‘She didn’t think she could have 
friends in the real world. I told her it wasn’t real. It was scary.’

Of
 the images on Tumblr, Mrs Wilson told the inquest: ‘It was pictures of 
her cutting herself. It’s like the worst horror movie you have ever seen
 in your house.

‘I realised 
there were young girls on there cutting themselves to see who is worse. 
It’s unbelievable. I saw one girl post a picture with a noose, and the 
picture said, “Here’s your new necklace, try it on”.’

The inquest heard claims that Tallulah
 had been bullied at St Marylebone School in Westminster, which she 
attended until summer 2012. In September she started at £11,000-a-year 
St Margaret’s School in Hampstead. By this time she had become addicted 
to the websites, her mother said.

The
 teenager – who was diagnosed with clinical depression – had regularly 
posted troubling messages on Twitter, including; ‘I will never be 
beautiful and skinny’ and ‘I have absolutely no plan for my future’.

One of her final messages was: ‘Why the f*** should I stay if no one around me stays for me? I’m done. #suicide #goodbye.’

A
 spokesman for Tumblr said last night that ‘issues of depression and 
self-harm are extremely challenging, particularly in online environments
 that encourage  self-expression’.

He added that the site has policies 
to address harmful content and is committed to improving its ability to 
act on  self-harm content.

Martyn
 Piper, whose 17-year-old son Tim killed himself in 2002 after searching
 online for information on suicide, is vice-chairman of Papyrus, a 
charity that works to prevent youth suicides. He said: ‘We believe there
 is no place for such sites and forums.

At the very least they must be 
brought within the regulatory processes seeking to tackle other internet
 dangers, such as sexualisation of children and pornography.’
