More U.S. troops are committing suicide than are being killed in active service in Afghanistan, shocking figures have revealed.

Even before not-yet-released data from October, the number of suicides among active and reserve army personnel this year has surpassed the number of combined military combat deaths from January to October 22, according to CNS News.

A total of 247 U.S. army personnel are believed to have taken their own lives between January and September this year, army data shows. This compares to 222 deaths from 'hostile causes' in Afghanistan.

The figures, collated by the Brookings Institution, show an extra 40 troops were killed by 'non-hostile causes' while on deployments in the country.

This means their deaths were not caused by the Taliban, insurgency forces or Afghan forces.

The latest army statistics on troop suicides were released last Friday and show 15 active duty soldiers are suspected of killing themselves last month alone. The same number of potential suicides was recorded in August.

'Every suicide in our ranks is a tragic loss for the Army family, adversely affecting the readiness of our Army,' Lt. Gen. Howard B. Bromberg, deputy chief of staff for manpower and personnel, said in a Department of Defense release.

'I am asking soldiers, family members, Department of the Army civilians, neighbors, and friends to look out for each other and reach out and embrace those who may be struggling,' he said.

'Recognize the warning signs such as substance abuse, relationship problems, and withdrawal from friends and activities and use available resources to help yourself or others. Our actions can save lives.'

For the year up to September, 146 potential suicides were recorded among active-duty army personnel and an additional 101 possible suicides were recorded for troops not on active duty.

Marine Corps commandment James Amos 
said the problem wasn't confined to the army and that all armed services
 were experiencing a 'tough year' when it came to suicides, according to
 CNS.news.

'Even with the attention of the leadership, I think all the services this year are feeling it,' Amos said.

'I
 guess what I would tell everybody here is there is, through no shortage
 of great effort and leadership on the part of all the services to try 
to abate this, but this year, I think, is going to be a tough year for 
all the services.'

Tribute: Ashley Wise kicked off an online project by posting this picture of herself in honour of her husband

Around one in five veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is believed to suffer from some form of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Led by Ashley Wise, whose husband Rob developed the condition after his second tour of duty in Iraq, a group of military wives has started an initiative called Battling Bare, in which they pose with a poetic pledge written on their bare bodies.

The message, aimed at raising awareness of PTSD and showing support for their husbands reads: 'Broken by battle, wounded by war, my love is forever, to you this I swore. I will quiet your silent screams, help heal your shattered soul, until once again my love you are whole.'
