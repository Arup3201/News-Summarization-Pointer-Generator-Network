Worrying news has emerged for homeowners looking to put their property on the market, as it has been revealed that house prices dropped by over £900 a week last month.

According to the Halifax Price Index, the average home now costs £159,883, down 2.4% per cent from £163,796 in March - the same level as in 2004.

The ending of the stamp duty holiday 
for first-time buyers in late March appears to have boosted home sales 
early this year as buyers strove to beat the deadline, and has probably 
contributed to the volatility in house prices, Halifax said.

House prices have now fallen 11.8 per cent since they reached their peak in October 2007.

The figure is a UK average which does not take into account regional fluctuations.

In April 2010, as the property market hit a high point following its bounce back from the 2008/9 slump, the average price of a UK property was £168,593, Halifax says.

The average home has lost £10,000 since then.

But
last month's 2.4 per cent fall follows an increase of 2.2 per cent in 
March and actually leaves the more reliable three-month house price 
change measure up 0.3 per cent, Halifax said.

That rise in prices in the three-month period was the first increase on a quarterly basis since September, following six successive falls.

However, house prices have fallen 0.5 per cent over the past year, stand at the same level as in August 2004 and are down £40,000 on the August 2007 peak.

This week, Nationwide's house price index reported that property values last month saw a 0.2 per cent fall - the fourth month out of five that house prices have fallen.

And Nationwide warned that house prices, which on average were also 0.9 per cent down on April last year, were set to stagnate or fall throughout 2012, as households' confidence lagged behind any possible economic recovery.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: ‘Despite the slight improvement in the underlying trend in recent months, house prices continue to lack real direction, with the current UK average price little different to where it was at the end of 2011.’
