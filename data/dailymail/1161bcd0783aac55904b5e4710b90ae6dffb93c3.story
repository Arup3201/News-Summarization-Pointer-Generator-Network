Former Royal Navy Officer has been jailed for 14 years for a series of sex attacks on children which led to him be being labelled 'one of the nastiest paedophiles' police had ever dealth with

A Royal Navy officer described as one of 'nastiest' paedophiles police have ever dealt with has been jailed for sexually assaulting two young children.

Former Chief Petty Officer Geoffrey Rooney of Plymouth, Devon, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for a series of horrific sex crimes against children.

The mother of  two of his victims has today told of the misery his sickening crimes have caused.

Rooney, 39, was once well-respected in the Navy and had postings to Whitehall in 2009 and 2010 which saw him work alongside come of Britain's top commanders.

But between late 2013 and early 2014 he carried out a series of sex attacks on children, some of which he  photographed on his mobile phone.

Rooney was tracked down after a woman called police and said she had found indecent images of children which had been emailed to her husband.

Rooney's emails which contained indecent images of children also had requests for the man to allow his own children to be sexually abused.

Police found Rooney had sent pictures to another paedophile showing him abusing a sleeping child.

Rooney admitted raping a girl under 13, sexually assaulting another young girl, taking indecent photos of kids, sexually assaulting a boy and making, possessing and distributing child porn images.

Sentencing him at Plymouth Crown Court, Judge Paul Darlow described him as a 'casual, callous predatory paedophile'.

A mother whose children were just a baby and toddler at the time of the offences has told Rooney's crimes have hugely damaged her and children's lives.

She said: 'When the police told me, I started shaking uncontrollably. They came around five days later and showed us the pictures. He told the police they were my children. But we still needed to look at the pictures to identify them.

'It was just disgusting. I felt so physically sick. I just broke down and could not carry on. The image was imprinted on my mind.'

The court heard Rooney (pictured with a toddler and a baby) joked about his abuse  in online forums

The mother added: 'The images will stay with us for the rest of our lives. They have caused a lot of trauma. That feeling of violation is never going to go away.

'(My children) had to be taken away to be medically examined. They had to have a lot of tests. Every time I took them out they were really nervous - we had to go to a few different clinics.

'I could not face it. One of my daughters had a mental health assessment and has needed speech therapy and I have had to receive counselling.'

Rooney was arrested after an image of him abusing the woman's baby was found on his mobile phone. 

The mother expressed her anger at Rooney's sentence, which means he will be freed in just six years.

The mother said that it was Rooney's seemingly normal existence that made his crimes more chilling.

Rooney was once a trusted Navy officer who was posted to Whitehall in 2009 and 2010, it has emerged

She said: 'He was not your stereotype of a paedophile and that is the scariest thing. He was a respected sailor in the Navy, who would have had to go through the strongest of background checks to work in Whitehall.

'He was really sneaky, horrible and manipulative. It was scary just how confident he was. What we have been through is every mother's worst nightmare.

'If I had any advice for others it would be to always believe what your children say, go with your gut feeling and listen to what they are saying.'

After the case, investigator Det Con Pete Shotton said: '(Rooney) was utterly driven by his preoccupation with child sexual abuse. That one little phone call has uncovered one of the nastiest predatory paedophiles we've dealt with. He gloried in it.'
