A 14-year-old American boy abducted with his mother and cousin by suspected Muslim militants in the
Philippines was today safe after escaping from his captors, the Philippine military said.

After walking for two days without shoes, Kevin Lunsmann was found by a village official in Lamitan town on southern Basilan Island yesterday. He had spent five months in captivity.

The area is a 
stronghold of the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are believed to
be behind the kidnapping, said military spokesman Lt. Col. Randolph 
Cabangbang.

The boy is now safe in military custody, Cabangbang said.

Police Senior Superintendent Edwin de 
Ocampo said Kevin, of Campbell County, Virginia, 
told his kidnappers that he would take a bath in a stream, then ran away.

The
boy, who was barefoot, followed a river and ran away when he saw 
villagers, who eventually assured him that they were friends.

Mr De Ocampo said the boy was fine except for bruises on his legs and arms.

His Filipino-American mother, 
Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, was freed two months ago after she was dropped 
off by boat at a wharf on Basilan.

Their Filipino cousin, Romnick 
Jakaria, dashed to freedom last month when special Philippine army 
forces managed to get near an Abu Sayyaf camp in the mountains of 
Basilan.

They were believed to be held for ransom, but Cabangbang did not say Saturday whether any was paid.

U.S. ambassador Harry Thomas said the boy would be reunited with his family soon.

'In
this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an 
innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday 
celebrations,' Mr Thomas said.

'I also want to acknowledge the courage of Kevin himself, and his family, throughout this long ordeal.'

He said there would be a 'speedy investigation and prosecution of all those involved in the kidnapping of American citizens.'

The three were vacationing with 
relatives on an island near Zamboanga city when they were snatched July 
12 and taken by boat to nearby Basilan.

The captors then called the 
family in Campbell County, Virginia, to demand a ransom.

The U.S. and Philippine governments 
did not pay any ransom for the mother's release, Interior Secretary 
Jessie Robredo said in October, adding that he was unaware whether any 
private group did.

Ransom kidnappings have long been a 
problem in the impoverished region and are blamed mostly on the Abu 
Sayyaf, a group on a list of U.S. terrorist organizations and notorious 
for beheadings and bombings over the past two decades.

Its stated goal has been the establishment of an Islamic state in the southern Philippines, home to minority Muslims in the predominantly Christian nation.

The Abu Sayyaf was founded on Basilan 
in the 1990s as an offshoot of a violent Muslim insurgency that has been
raging for decades.

Hundreds of U.S. troops have been 
stationed in the southern Philippines, including Basilan, to train and 
equip Philippine forces but are prohibited from engaging in local 
combat.

On Monday, suspected militants 
abducted Australian Warren Richard Rodwell, 53, from his seaside house 
in Zamboanga Sibugay province, near Basilan, but it was not immediately 
confirmed if they also belonged to the Abu Sayyaf.

The militants are also holding an Indian, a Malaysian and a Japanese.
