Shiva: Katarzyna
Dryden-Chouen said the cannabis was 
to have been offered to the god ahead of Dec 21 last year, when she 
believed the world would end

A woman who said she grew cannabis to 
sacrifice to the Hindu god Shiva because the world was about to end has 
been cleared of intending to supply the drug.

Katarzyna
Dryden-Chouen, 46, and her husband Clive, 60, had been accused of 
making £277,000 by dealing cannabis over a six year period.

Police alleged that almost £13,000 found in their home in Littledean, Gloucestershire, was also the proceeds of drug dealing.

But
Mrs Dryden-Chouen, who is originally from Poland, insisted that apart 
from what she and her husband smoked, the cannabis was to be burnt as a 
religious sacrifice.

Mrs 
Dryden-Chouen, who claimed to have a talking pet mouse, said it would 
all have been offered to Shiva ahead of December 21 last year, when she 
believed the world would end.

She
and her husband admitted growing the cannabis. Plants capable of 
yielding up to 2.9lb of the drug - worth about £6,000 - were found 
growing throughout their home, a former pub.

But
they denied having the drug with intent to supply as well as money 
laundering charges and were found not guilty adter a three-week trial at
Gloucester Crown Court.

Her
husband said that the £13,000 cash and the £277,000 which went through 
their hands in six years was the proceeds of his business converting 
cars to run on liquid petroleum gas.

He admitted he did not have a bank account and had not paid tax on income which he said he was paid in cash.

The
main evidence in the trial had been detailed diaries kept by Mrs 
Dryden-Chouen in which she appeared to note details of cannabis growing 
and selling.

But she 
told the jury the notes were a fiction, created in her imagination as 
she meditated for long periods at a time without eating.

The couple had both pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to cultivating cannabis between January 2009 and August 2012. Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied possessing cannabis with intent to supply between November 2003 and January 2004.

She and her husband both denied a similar charge between January 2004 and January 2009 and a third charge relating to the period between January 2009 and August last year when police raided their home.

Mr and Mrs Dryden-Chouen further denied a money laundering offence - converting £277,559 which was the proceeds of crime between June 2006 and August 2012. They also denied that the £12,890 found near a 'shrine' in the house was criminal property - the proceeds of drug dealing.

Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied a further charge of possessing diazepam tablets with intent to supply on 6th July 2012.

After almost five-and-a-half hours of deliberations, a jury found the couple not guilty of all outstanding charges.

But Judge Alastair McGrigor warned them they may still face jail on the cultivation of cannabis charge. He bailed them for pre-sentence reports and adjourned to a date to be fixed.

The jury heard that when Mrs Dryden-Chouen was arrested in July last year she said she was a homeopath and healer and that she did not know having cannabis was illegal.

She said she grew cannabis for religious purposes and medical research. She also said she believed the world was coming to an end on December 21 last year and she intended to create a Homa (a burning pit) for a ceremony to burn the cannabis.

Prosecutor Paul Grumbar said that 'just about every room in the house had cannabis in it' when police stormed in.

In all, said Mr Grumbar, the police recovered 15 established plants and 41 juvenile ones which would have yielded 2.866lb of flowering head cannabis. The drug sells for about £2,250 a pound.

Also found in three locations in the property were 1,844 blue Diazepam tablets.

And in a white metal box in an office/meditation room there was £12,890 in cash which the prosecution claimed was the proceeds of drug dealing.

After the jury gave its verdict the judge asked whether Mr Dryden-Chouen might now be prosecuted for not paying income tax.

He said it would be helpful to know before he passes sentence on the couple whether the Customs and Revenue will be following that up.

Mr Grumbar said: 'The Revenue will no doubt be contacted.'

Judge McGrigor granted Mr Grumbar's application to have all the drugs and growing paraphernalia found in the house destroyed.

Bailing the couple he told them: 'This matter is not entirely over. You are going to be sentenced in relation to the material that was found in the house. All options are still open to the court.'
