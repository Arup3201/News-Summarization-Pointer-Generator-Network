Move over Tea Party! A certain NFL player may be enemy number one to the Internal Revenue Service after he posted a photo of himself urinating their office building.

Philadelphia Eagles lineman Evan Mathis added a photo of himself peeing on the IRS building to his Instagram stream yesterday.

The offensive guard is seen standing in front of the Washington, DC IRS headquarters, his back to the camera, relieving himself on some signage.

Number one fan: Philadelphia Eagles lineman Evan Mathis proves he's not a tax whiz as he lets out a stream of frustration on the IRS building in Washington, DC

Perhaps Mathis thought he would turn the tables on the government and take a leak on them?

Though he’s in the act of what could easily constitute a federal crime, Mathis was unconcerned about showing the world his moment of defiance.

‘Audit this,’ he tweeted, with a link to the photo.

Fans and followers of the 31-year-old’s social media feeds immediately began reposting and replying to the candid pic.

What a squirt: 31-year-old Mathis posted his pee pic on Instagram and Twitter for all the public to see yesterday and remains unrepentant

‘This is a good way to get arrested in DC,’ said Instagram user hindsdm.

And on Twitter, @DCFanaticsBlog wrote, ‘Evan Mathis will be apologizing later today. Count on that.’

To which Mathis replied: ‘How high we counting?’

It is unclear if Mathis was actually urinating on the building or if a tell-tale wet spot seen in the photo was merely a shadow.

Shameless: 'Audit this,' wrote Mathis along with the pic

Federal law protects all government property from destruction and defilement and reads ‘When property damage does not exceed $100, the offense is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $100,000, one year imprisonment, or both.’

Mathis recently underwent ankle surgery. In the photo, the nine-year NFL veteran’s leg can be seen in a plastic boot.

Run for it: The offensive lineman could face 'a fine of up to $100,000, one year imprisonment, or both'
