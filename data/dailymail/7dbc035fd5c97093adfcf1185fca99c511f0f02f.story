A Texas hunting club that auctioned off a permit to kill an endangered black rhinoceros says it will cancel the winner's hunt if a federal agency denies his request to bring the dead rhino back to the U.S. as a trophy.

Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in Namibia -- a species listed as critically endangered, according to CBS News. 

Knowlton applied for a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last Spring that would allow him to import the body of the endangered animal from Namibia after his hunt. The agency has yet to give him an answer.

Opportunity: A Club official said that Knowlton bid on the opportunity for the experience, not to parade a dead animal around

Many opposed the auction. Knowlton and the Club even received death threats from activists wanting the hunt called off. Now the opposition may get their wish.

The Club plans to refund Knowlton's money if the agency denies his request. 

The Club billed the auction as a fundraising effort to to save the endangered species but the agency is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching CBS reports, and the agency is evaluating whether the hunt will result in enhancement of the species's survival.

'Most people that have an animal mounted, it's their memory of their experience,' Ben Carter, the Club's executive director, told CBS. 'It's not always, 'Look at what I've shot.' When they look at it, they remember everything. That's what he bid the money on, that opportunity.'

Knowlton told WFAA in January that he simply wants to experience a black rhino.

'I'm a hunter,' Knowlton said. 'I want to experience a black rhino. I want to be intimately involved with a black rhino.'

Black Rhino: Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt an older, male, non-breeding black rhino in Namibia

The opposition doesn't see it that way. Many are fervently protesting the hunt and, protester Susan Oakley told CBS that claims that the hunt is ultimately to save the species 'don't hold water.' The agency is holding public comment until Dec. 8 and plans to make its decision afterward. 

The agency is taking into account the condition of the critically endangered species and the fact that more than 1/3 of the world's black rhino population live in the Namibian herd where Knowlton is to hunt.

Knowlton, an active hunter who goes on hunting trips around the globe, received the permit to kill an older, male, non-breeding rhino that has been responsible for the death of other rhinos, CBS reports. 

And proceeds of the auction reportedly went to the Namibia Wildlife Products trust, a fund run by the Namibian government in an effort to boost the specie's population.

Protesters: Many are fervently protesting the hunt saying the 'kill it to save it' logic is cruel and not conservation at all

Wrong: Many protesters hold that the Club's claims that the hunt is an effort to preserve species 'holds no water' but the culling of old, sick, or problematic animals is a common practice in wildlife management 

It is a common practice in wildlife management, conservationists say, to kill herds of old, sick, or problematic animals, according to CBS. 

Each year, Namibia grants up to five permits to hunt the rhinos and this, in turn, funds efforts that protect the species. But activists say the 'kill it to save it' logic is cruel and not conservation at all.

Arguments surrounding the situation have even grown to involve the FBI, CBS reports. The Club received death threats like: 'For every rhino you shoot, we'll kill ten of your members' and 'The winner of this hunt will find himself in the crosshairs.' The Club has turned the threats over to the FBI 

The agency must take all arguments into account, and said it will examine how the auctioned funds will be administered. But for now, Knowlton's hunt hangs in the balance as both he, and the Club, await the agency's decision.
