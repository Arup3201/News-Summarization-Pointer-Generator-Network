Leo
 Waddell was one of the young people who started taking hormone blockers
 on the Tavistock and Portman clinic’s trial at the age of just 12.

The
 schoolboy, who began life as Lily, has favoured boy’s clothes over 
dresses and frills since he was a toddler and at the age of nine told 
his mother:  ‘I don’t want to be a girl any more.’

He admitted that  if he had been forced to continue living as a girl, ‘I would probably kill myself’.

Leo 
described being referred to the gender identity development service in 
2001 as ‘amazing’ because he was finally able to start living his life.

Initially
 ‘Lily’s’ mother Hayley, pictured above with her son, thought her 
desire to act like a boy would be something she would grow out of, but 
as she got older and continued to reject all things feminine she 
realised this wasn’t the case.

At the age of 11 she allowed Lily to change her name by deed poll to Leo.

But Leo, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, recalled how  even with his family’s understanding, he still struggled.

He
 said: ‘School was tough. It was normal until year six, but then when I 
got my name changed they wouldn’t call me Leo for about three months, 
and then when they started calling me Leo they still wouldn’t call me 
“he”, they carried on calling me “she”.’

His
 mother added: ‘Especially where we come from there was a lot of 
ignorance surrounding gender dysphoria because no one had heard of it – 
not the doctor, not the schools, not even social services.’
