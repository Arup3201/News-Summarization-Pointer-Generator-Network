Rolls-Royce is drawing up plans for a radical 4X4 off-roader, its bosses have revealed.

The ultimate luxury British car firm is planning to break with more than a century of tradition by allowing the legendary Spirit of Ecstasy 'Flying Lady' mascot to adorn a ‘Chelsea tractor’.

The biggest hint yet that the firm renowned for the ‘waftability’ and engineering excellence of its limousines is to press ahead with a  sports utility vehicle (SUV) was dropped by Rolls-Royce chief executive chief executive officer Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes in an interview with leading motoring magazine Auto Express.

Glimpse to the future: This is how a planned 4X4 vehicle by Rolls Royce, the car company's first, could look

When asked directly if a Rolls-Royce 4X4 was to go ahead, he replied: ’I have not ruled it out.’

And teasingly, when asked if a gambler might bet on the project getting the green light, he replied: ’Make that bet. Do it.’

It is understood detailed design plans have been drawn up and are being studied by top executives in Britain and at the Munich headquarters of the firm’s German parent company BMW .

They accept the controversial idea may divide opinion but are aware that luxury rivals such as Bentley and others including Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Maserati are preparing their own 4X4s which are expected to be a huge hit in lucrative markets such as China and the Middle East.

Rolls-Royce said has previously described talk of a 4X4 as 'speculation' but has not denied reports that detailed plans have been drawn up. Auto Express has created its own exclusive images showing how such a vehicle could look based on the ‘design language’ of existing models such as the Phanton, Ghost and Wraith.

Still stylish: Bosses say the new off-roader would retain all the features of a classic Rolls Royce, as this picture shows. The new model could be on the road by 2017

Mr Mueller-Oetvoes told Auto Express: ‘There’s growth in the SUV sector and such a vehicle is thinkable. I’m open to that. Our design director Giles Taylor is already doing the first sketches.

‘But I can tell you that it will not look like a Hummer’, he said referring to the massive gas-guzzling military-derived American off-roader.

Separately, bosses insist privately that the main challenge is to produce a car which rides and handles like a Rolls-Royce and does not sacrifice quality.

Rolls-Royce, whose boutique factory is based at Goodwood in Sussex in the grounds of the Earl of March's estate, has most recently launched a new  sporty £235,0000 two-door ‘sportback’ coupe called the Wraith powered by a 6.7 litre engine.

A cabriolet version is set to follow. It already builds four versions of its range-topping Phantom and two versions of its smaller 'baby' Ghost.

But now executives are planning the next chapter of the range from 2017 and beyond with an SUV on the drawing board.

Auto Express said Rolls-Royce design chief  Mr Taylor has been shuttling frequently between the firm’s Goodwood home  and BMW headquarters in Munich: ’It is understood the main purpose  of Taylor’s frequent visits is to present a variety of SUV designs to BMW’s top brass.’

It noted: ’It’s a project that’s been rumoured for years and denied several times. But the top man at Rolls-Royce has given the clearest indication yet that we will see an SUV from the brand. And our amazing images show how this amazing model could look.’

It notes: ‘They show how Rolls’ latest design language - as seen in the Ghost and the Wraith - could translate into a higher-riding SUV.

Sleek: Rolls Royce recently unveiled its latest model, the Wraith, which is worth more than £200,000

‘The traditional chrome grille sits proud at the front, topped off by the signature Spirit of Ecstacy. Meanwhile the graceful lines and rear-hinged doors both provide plenty of  Rolls-Royce class.’

With a price of around £250,000, it says power will most likely be provided by the Wraith’s 6.7 twin turbo V12 which give acceleration from rest to 62mph in around 4.5 seconds. Top speed is likely to be electronically limited to 155mph.

Auto Express said Rolls-Royce was keen to target ‘an increasingly important fresher, younger breed of super-rich buyers from high-profile sports, music and film stars to dot com millionaires.’

It said: ’Despite their wealth, many are in their thirties or even twenties, could well be Chinese and have a desire to own a Rolls – but not necessarily a ‘traditional’ limousine.’

In February BMW board member and Rolls-Royce chairman Harald Krüger was asked by CAR magazine about the prospect of a 4X$ and replied:‘We’re monitoring the competition’s activities, and we’re regularly debating whether to take action. This applies to all brand-relevant segments and technologies.’

He added:'The BMW Group is confidently investing into the long-term future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.’

Porsche broke the 4X4 mould when it launched its Cayenne sports utility vehicle. And Bentley – owned by Germany’s giant Volkswagen Group - is currently giving a facelift to a prototype super-luxury Bentley off-roader which it announced recently will be built in Britain at its factory in Crewe.

Rolls-Royce was founded after sales and marketing genius the Honourable Charles Stewart Rolls met legendary engineer Henry Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester on May 4, 1904 with the aim of creating the world's finest motor car.

German car giant BMW bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from Vickers PLC in 1998 following a bidding war with rivals Volkswagen which secured Bentley - with the first BMW-produced Rolls-Royce Phantom launched in 2003.

Rolls-Royce says the new Wraith ‘sportback’, reviving an ethereal spirit name first used in 1938, is 'the most dynamic and powerful Rolls-Royce in history.'
