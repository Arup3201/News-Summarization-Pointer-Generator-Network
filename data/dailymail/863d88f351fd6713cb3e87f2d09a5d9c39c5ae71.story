A disability benefits cheat has been jailed for 15 months today after she was photographed scuba diving at exotic locations around the world despite claims she was bedridden.

Rose Jones, 53, pocketed more than £135,000 of taxpayers’ money after convincing authorities she was unsteady on her feet, bedridden and unable to work.

She claimed  
Incapacity Benefit and Disability Living Allowance for suffering a spinal condition that left her immobile, on a variety of painkillers and battling the effects of a stroke which left her unable to sit in a chair, climb stairs and incontinent.

Her husband, former Paratrooper Reginald Jones, 53, claimed £5,351 in Carer’s Allowance and £15,975 in Working Tax Credits as he struggled to set up a dog grooming company and needed the money to help meet his bills.

In reality, the couple who lived in Ramsgate, Kent at the time,  were living a lavish lifestyle travelling to exotic locations including the Maldives, Indonesia and Osnabruck, Germany for scuba diving courses funded by benefits over 16 years.

Mr Jones, from Dover, Kent, was sentenced 18 months in jail and Mrs Jones, who had been residing in Germany, for 15 months.

The couple, who have since broken up, were jailed by Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl at Canterbury Crown Court today.

The couple's daughter Deborah Jones, 29, said her mother was remorseful.

She said: “My mum is so remorseful. She understands she has done wrong - that is why she owned up and pleaded guilty.

'But she was pressured into it by him (Mr Jones). He is not my father. I have disowned him.

Secret trips: Mrs Jones' now ex-husband claimed she went on secret diving trips with scuba diving instructor Udo Kefrig (pictured centre with Mrs Jones' daughter Ms Van Aalst and Ms Jones)

'She is so ashamed of herself. She says she wished she had been strong enough to leave my father sooner.'

Mr Jones told the jury his wife went on secret scuba diving and skiing trips behind his back to Abu Dhabi, Egypt and Panama with scuba diving instructor Udo Kefrig who had become her lover. 

Mrs Jones walked out on her husband in 2010 and now lives with Mr Kefrig in Germany.

Judge Van Der Biyl said they had ‘gilded the lily’ to get benefits for which they were not entitled to.

He said: ‘Both were fully involved in this joint enterprise. 

‘The department works on trust and cannot be expected to check every case, they have to rely on what people tell them.’

Far from being unable to work, Mrs Jones was employed from March 1996 until February 2000 by a care homes company in Margate.

She then held down two full-time jobs at the same time, one as a caretaker and one as a concierge.

Helen Guest, prosecuting, told the jury that from 1994 to 2010 the couple kept up the pretence to officials that Mrs Jones was unable to work because of her crippling condition.

Bedridden: In official documents Mrs Jones claimed she could not walk 50 metres or open a bottle of wine all while she was photographed scuba diving (model in photo)

In one official document Mrs Jones wrote: ‘I cannot bend or kneel or pick up a piece of paper from the floor. Have problems sitting in a chair for five minutes and back tends to lock and it hurts to get up.

‘I am bedridden, my back condition is deteriorating, I cannot walk for more than 50 metres without stopping or feeling severe discomfort. I have problems with stairs and am also unable to open a bottle of wine.’

The court heard Mrs Jones informed authorities she could not wash and dress without the help of her husband ‘because my back locks’.

In 1997 she claimed she suffered from ‘a severe back/spinal and nerve pain, which goes down both legs and thighs into my toes. Had spinal back operations’.

Mrs Jones did have back problems but they did not qualify for disability benefits, the court heard.

Ms Guest said: ‘Mrs Jones was clearly capable of working managing to hold down two jobs simultaneously for a significant period.’

The couple also owned a motor home complete with personalised number plate B1G REG.

When fraud officers raided the couple’s home Mr Jones asked: ‘What am I supposed to have done?’

Mrs Jones admitted 10 offences of cheating taxpayers and was found guilty on two others.

Mr Jones, who now works as a paramedic, was convicted on seven fraud charges after the 11-day trial.
