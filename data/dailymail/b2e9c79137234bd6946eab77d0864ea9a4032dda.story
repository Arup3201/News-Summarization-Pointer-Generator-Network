If Tottenham go on to lift the Europa League trophy next May, very few will remember their opening group stage encounter at Partizan Belgrade.

Spurs hustled a goalless draw in Serbia but while it was without major incident on the pitch, the stalemate showed a rather unfamiliar robust performance from the north London outfit – one they will likely have to give again on the road to Warsaw.

Attacking has never been a major problem for a Spurs side on a consistent basis, but having the personnel in defence to soak up pressure under a hostile crowd has been found wanting all too often. The recipe was there for disaster in the group stage opener.

A brand new defensive partnership in Federico Fazio and Jan Vertonghen, 10 changes and key players being left at home were among the reasons why the 150 Spurs fans which made the journey could have been left fearing the worst when the line-ups were announced.

By contrast, the other more audible 90 per cent of the Partizan Stadium were buoyed at hearing the full team confirmations come through the PA system and the prospect of facing an under strength opposition.

An interesting Serbian heavy metal take on Rod Stewart’s ‘Sailing’ (twice) had already whipped the home crowd into a frenzy in the build up to the game, and the Tottenham players soon knew about it before a ball had even been kicked.

Whether it was playing a pass during the game, or strolling on to take part in the pre-match warm up, Spurs were booed, whistled and jeered heavily throughout the night to almost deafening levels.

Regardless of the quality of the opposition Tottenham were up against, they were never going to stroll to an easy three points in this environment. Maybe they could have had a go, and by have a go, I mean record a shot on target. 

But for all of Partizan’s overall control of the game – the home side very rarely gave Hugo Lloris any tests to deal with in the Spurs goal.

There were moments where Tottenham nearly shot themselves in the foot. Debutant Fazio impressed but misjudged a first-half header to hand the hosts a chance, while a counter attack near the end of the opening 45 minutes brought a good save from Lloris diving to his far post.

But the combination of Fazio and Vertonghen at centre back had the majority of threats covered throughout the encounter, and gave fans genuine hope they can form a stable partnership at the back in the near future.

A point away from home at Partizan is a positive result for Spurs. Manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted post-match he picked a side to win, and even my Red Star Belgrade-supporting taxi driver ahead of the match was confident Tottenham would triumph 3-1 (which if anything rather confirmed my suspicions he just hated Partizan – which with a thumbs up and a smile, he acknowledged when I put it to him).

Much like the Premier League cliche of teams needing to perform on a wet Tuesday night in Stoke to show their worth, in Europe Spurs must be able to grind out results when factors outside their control mean they cannot play their natural high pressing game on playing surfaces smother than a billiard table.

Regardless of the changes made to the squad, Spurs will still be hoping to lift the Europa League trophy more than any other cup competition this term – with the additional prize of Champions League football going to the winner.

Drawing 0-0 isn’t going to make Europe step up and take note. But while Tottenham have always had a Plan A in trying to outscore the other team, this particular stalemate shows that a more defensive Plan B could be just what Spurs need in their locker to go all the way in this competition.
