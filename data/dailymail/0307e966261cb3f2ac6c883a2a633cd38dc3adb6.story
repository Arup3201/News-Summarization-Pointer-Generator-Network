A teenage girl has died and four other people were in hospital last night amid fears that they took illegal party drug mephedrone.

Helen Henderson, 19, fell ill at a house on Sunday night and died a short time later.

Her death comes as a global drug survey shows that Britain is the legal highs capital of the world, with more than one in ten people having tried dangerous new substances.

The study also found that people in the UK take more drugs of any kind – both illegal and legal – than any other country in the world.

Last night, as Police Scotland issued a warning that people are risking their lives by taking illicit substances, family and friends paid tribute to Miss Henderson.

On Facebook, her father, Alex, said: ‘Well family and friends my oldest daughter sadly passed away last night, now she is with the family and the angels.

‘You will be sadly missed by your family, love you so much, I hope you knew that, love Dad. Until we meet again sweetheart.’

Her stepmother, Sharon Newton, wrote: ‘Well to everyone we know, we sadly lost Alex daughter and my stepdaughter, taken away too young. G.B.N.F [Gone but not forgotten]. Miss you loads xxx.’

Her sister ChelseaLee Henderson added on Facebook: ‘Times like this family means everything, thanks for the nice messages everyone, such nice day today. Rest in peace Helen Louise Henderson my angel.’

Miss Henderson fell ill at around 10.15pm on Sunday at an address in Paisley Road, Renfrew. She died in the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley a short time later.

wo other women, aged 18 and 19, and two men, 24 and 31, were taken to hospital, where they are being treated for the effects of drug

Two other women at the house, aged 18 and 19, and two men, aged 24 and 31, were taken to hospital and are being treated after showing symptoms consistent with drug misuse, police said.

Officers believe they may have taken the lethal drug mephedrone – which has the street names MCAT, meow meow or bubble.

The teenager’s death comes two months after schoolgirl Regane MacColl, 17, of Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, died after taking a Mortal Kombat ecstasy tablet in the Arches nightclub,  Glasgow.

In March, teenager Jack Blades, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, was left fighting for his life after apparently taking a Mortal Kombat pill at a house party. The 16-year-old has since made a full recovery.

Earlier this month, father of two Paul Stokes, 39, was left fighting for his life in hospital after swallowing ecstasy tablets outside the Arches. He has since recovered.

Police Scotland yesterday warned revellers that ‘no one can predict the risks involved’ in drugtaking.

Chief Inspector Arlene Smith said: ‘Extensive inquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the woman’s death and, although unconfirmed, one of the lines of inquiry is that prior to her taking unwell she may have taken an illegal substance.

‘Given that other people have also fallen ill and are currently in hospital, Police Scotland has taken the decision to issue a warning.

‘At this time, it may be that the drug involved is MCAT. However, witnesses believe that the woman may have also taken ketamine.

Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton.

Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury.

A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010.

The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds.

Earlier this year the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from other legal highs.

Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009.

It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years.In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death.

A Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring.

‘MCAT is the street name for mephedrone. This is a class B drug which is sold in the form of white powder or capsules. Police Scotland is issuing a warning to anyone who has obtained or taken this or similar substances. Do not take illicit drugs and stay away from any unknown substances. No one can predict the risks involved or the serious consequences.’

Officers also appealed for anyone with information to come forward.

Police Scotland said a post- mortem will be carried out and that Miss Henderson’s death is being treated as unexplained.

A neighbour at the flat in Paisley Road, Marie Stuart, 39, said she was shocked by the death. She added: ‘I saw all the police cars and ambulances but I had no idea that someone died.

‘Helen was such a lovely girl, this really is tragic. It must have been a bad batch of drugs. I hope everyone else involved is all right.’

Another neighbour, Angela Liu, 35, said: ‘There was absolute chaos on Sunday night, at least six police cars and four ambulances.

‘I think it must have been quite a party house. I could always hear loud music and see lots of people going round. This is very upsetting, especially as she was so young.’

The Global Drug Survey, released yesterday, found that nearly a quarter of people in Britain asked said they had bought drugs over the internet, compared to only 14 per cent in the US and 4 per cent of people in New Zealand.

Dr Adam Winstock, an addiction specialist who founded the Global Drug Survey, said: ‘The fact that 44 per cent who bought drugs online said they’d done it for the first time recently says to me there is growing recruitment.

‘It is currently a minority way to get drugs, but it really mimics the growth in e-commerce. We buy things online because it is convenient, cheap, and there is a better product range.

‘We come out as some of the largest drug takers, taking a broader range of drugs that are reasonably cheap.’
