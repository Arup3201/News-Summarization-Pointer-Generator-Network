The U.S. Army's last Vietnam-era draftee has retired after 42 years of active service.

New York native Chief Warrant Officer 5 Ralph Rigby received a standing ovation at his retirement ceremony on October 28 at Camp Red Cloud in South Korea. 

The special occasion also coincided with his 62nd birthday. The machinery maintenance expert now plans to move back to America and settle in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Fond farewell: New York native Chief Warrant Officer 5 Ralph Rigby received a standing ovation at his retirement ceremony on October 28 at Camp Red Cloud in South Korea

Rigby was drafted into the Army in 1972 when he was 19 years old during the Vietnam era.

However, he was fortunate to not have to deploy there. Instead, after training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, Rigby was sent to the Army’s engineer school at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  

His first assignment then took him to Kwachon, South Korea. He enjoyed his time there so much that he extended his tour.

Over the years he has served at various levels, from power generator equipment repairman to platoon sergeant to ground support maintenance technician.

In his final role, he served as the senior ordnance logistics officer for the 2nd Infantry at Camp Red Cloud, South Korea.

Commenting on his lengthy military career, Rigby told Staff Sgt. Reshema Sherlock: 'I love what I do.

'The Army has allowed me to travel and see things that I would have never seen otherwise.'

Maj. Gen. Thomas Vandal, the 2nd Infantry’s commanding general, thanked Rigby for his service at his retirement service. 

Dedicated: Rigby mans a mounted M60 during a patrol in Afghanistan's Paptika province in July 2004 - No other individual in the unit had been trained on the legacy weapon, so Rigby volunteered for the mission

'Chief, you have truly been a bargain for the American people and our Army, a giver who has sacrificed much for the sake of our nation,' Vandal said. 

In July 2011, the Army announced that Command Sgt. Maj. Jeff Mellinger was retiring as the service's last Vietnam-era draftee. 

But Army officials later had to issue a correction when they learned Rigby and another soldier also were drafted and remained on active duty.

The other soldier, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Franklin Ernst, retired in 2012.

U.S. military conscription ended in 1973.
