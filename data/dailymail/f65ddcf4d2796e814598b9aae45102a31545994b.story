Police say Melissa Ann Martinez, 40, provided her son and his prom date with drugs an alcohol

The mother of a Texas teenager accused of choking his girlfriend to death during rough sex on prom night has been arrested for allegedly supplying her son and his date with drugs and alcohol on prom night.

Melissa Ann Martinez, 40, was arrested on Thursday and police say she gave her son Eddie M. Herrera, 18, and and his date Jacqueline Gomez, 17,  alcohol and drugs the night that Gomez died.

Herrera, 18, was charged with aggravated assault  in January for the May death of Jacqueline Gomez of Houston, Texas, after he admitted to choking her during sex.

The Houston Chronicle reports that Herrera told police he called his mom to help him dress  Gomez before calling police to tell them he woke to find her unresponsive.

Miss Gomez, 17, was found in the hotel room of the North Houston Hyatt Hotel on May 17, 2014, the same venue where the prom had been held the previous night. 

Investigators said Herrera told authorities the couple went to the hotel room after attending the prom, drank alcohol and fell asleep. 

Herrera told police that his girlfriend had taken the painkiller hydrocodone and he admitted they both drank whiskey.

The Chronicle reports that Herrera told conflicting stories to the cops about whether or not his girlfriend consented to him choking her.

Herrera said he found Miss Gomez, a senior at MacArthur High School, unresponsive the following morning.

Houston Fire Department personnel responded and pronounced her deceased. 

Her death was initially believed to be an overdose but the medical examiner could not confirm an exact cause.

The autopsy found that Gomez had deep hemorrhaging around her neck. 

She blood-alcohol level of .21, almost three times the state’s legal limit and also had hydrocodone in her system.

Authorities said a further investigation led them to arrest Herrera.

The motive and official cause of death remain under investigation, according a police statement. 

At the time of her death, Miss Gomez's devastated family and friends told the Houston Chronicle that she was 'not a party girl' and spent most of her time working at a grocery school when she was not studying. 

The teenager had plans of going to Lone Star College to become a pharmacy technician.
