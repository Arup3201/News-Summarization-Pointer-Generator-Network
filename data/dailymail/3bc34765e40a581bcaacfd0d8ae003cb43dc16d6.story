Our large brains, long legs and ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage up to 2.4 million years ago.

But new climate and fossil evidence shows these unique traits may have originated much earlier in our Australopithecus ancestors, between three and four million years ago.

The research also suggests that rather than forming as a single package, these key traits evolved individually, over a much longer timeframe.

Our large brains, long legs and ability to craft tools were thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage (illustration pictured left) up to 2.4 million years ago. New climate and fossil evidence shows these traits may have originated earlier, in Australopithecus ancestors (pictured right), 4 million years ago

Although scientists have recognised these characteristics for decades, they are now reconsidering the true evolutionary factors that drove them.

Paleoanthropologist Dr Richard Potts 
began by developing a climate framework for East African 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago.

This showed that the era was a 
time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet 
and dry seasons.

Researchers then reviewed the body of 
fossil evidence relevant to the origin of Homo, to understand how 
the human genus evolved.

Species' can be identified based on differences in the shape of their 
skulls, especially their face and jaws, but not on the basis of size.

These differences in their skulls suggest early Homo spread across the the 
environment, each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive.

Even
 though all Homo species had overlapping body, brain and tooth 
sizes, they also had larger brains and bodies than their likely 
ancestors, Australopithecus.

According
 to the study, these differences and similarities show the human 
package of traits evolved separately, and at different times in the past 
rather than all together.

It also blurs the lines as to when the traits began to evolve.

A large brain, long legs, the ability to craft tools and prolonged maturation periods were all thought to have evolved as African grasslands expanded and Earth’s climate became cooler and drier.

The new analysis, published in the journal Science, led the team to conclude that the ability of early humans to adjust to changing conditions ultimately enabled the earliest species of Homo to vary, survive, and begin spreading from Africa to Eurasia 1.85 million years ago.

time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet 
and dry seasons.

The framework, which is based on Earth’s astronomical cycles, provides the basis for some of the paper’s key findings, and it suggests that multiple coexisting species of Homo that overlapped geographically emerged in highly changing environments.

Dr Potts, curator of anthropology and director of the Human Origins Programme at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, said: ‘Unstable climate conditions favoured the evolution of the roots of human flexibility in our ancestors.

‘The narrative of human evolution that arises from our analyses stresses the importance of adaptability to changing environments, rather than adaptation to any one environment, in the early success of the genus Homo.’

Between 2.1 and 1.8 million years ago, the oldest species of Homo (pictured left and second from left) began to diversify. By 1.8 to 1.9 million years ago, Homo erectus (fossils pictured right and second from right) evolved in Africa and began spreading to Eurasia. These lineages overlapped for several hundred thousand years

The researchers then reviewed the entire body of fossil evidence relevant to the origin of Homo to better understand how the human genus evolved.

Susan Antón, professor of anthropology at New York University, said: ‘We can tell the species apart based on differences in the shape of their skulls, especially their face and jaws, but not on the basis of size.

‘The differences in their skulls suggest early Homo divvied up the environment, each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive.’

Even though all of the Homo species had overlapping body, brain and tooth sizes, they also had larger brains and bodies than the Australopithecus.

Leslie Aiello, president of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, added: ‘Taken together, these data suggest that species of early Homo were more flexible in their dietary choices than other species.'

The team concluded that this flexibility likely enhanced the ability of human ancestors to successfully adapt to unstable environments and disperse from Africa.

Dr Potts said: ‘This flexibility continues to be a hallmark of human biology today, and one that ultimately underpins the ability to occupy diverse habitats throughout the world.’

He said future research on new fossil and archaeological finds will need to focus on identifying specific adaptive features that originated with early Homo, which will yield a deeper understanding of human evolution.

Man’s large brains, long legs and the ability to craft tools are 
often thought to have evolved together at the start of the Homo lineage

This was when African grasslands expanded and climate became drier

But, fossil evidence suggests these traits didn't arise as a single package

Earth’s astronomical cycles suggests multiple species of Homo overlapped

@highlight

Traits said to have developed later have been spotted in earlier ancestors

This means our links with Australopithecus, for example, may have started sooner than first thought
