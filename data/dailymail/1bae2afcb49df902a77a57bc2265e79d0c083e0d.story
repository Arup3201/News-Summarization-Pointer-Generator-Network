A set of conjoined twins in Florida on Friday underwent the first of two surgeries intended to separate them.

The surgery gave Conner and Carter Mirabal, born joined at the belly December 12, two distinct small intestines.

The boys have two distinct livers that will be separated--along with the twins themselves--in a second and final surgery in six months.

Separating: On Friday, a first of two surgeries gave Conner and Carter Mirabal, born joined at the belly December 12, two distinct small intestines

More to come: The surgery separated the boys' small intestine, which they shared. They have two distinct livers, which are connected and must be separated before the twins are fully separated

'It's all worth it; it's going to be worth it in the end,' the boys' aunt Jasmine Mirabal told WJXT. 'It's worth it now, but it's really going to be worth it when they're home.'

Michelle Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal were shocked when they discovered they had conceived just six months after their Gage was born.

After 34 intense weeks of medical complications, Carter and Conner, connected at the abdomen and facing each other, were born weighing 5lbs each.

The boys required immediate surgery to repair damage to their stomachs but emerged from the operating room in good condition.

Conner and Carter were lucky to have been born each with nearly all of their own organs. Friday's surgery separated the small intestine which they shared

Surprised! Ms Brantley shared a picture of her ballooning pregnant belly just days before her water broke

The boys were delivered in Jacksonville after Brantley was rushed to a hospital a month before the original due date and five days before a recently-scheduled c-section.

Shortly before midnight, she and Mr Mirabal welcomed their sons into the world - baby brothers for their first child Gage. 

And despite suffering minor heart complications at first, Carter's heart is strengthening.

The survival rate for conjoined twins is between five and 25 per cent.

Ms Brantley and Mr Mirabal have spent the pregnancy in constant contact with Atlanta couple Robin and Michael Hamby, whose conjoined twin sons died the day they were born on December 5.

Elated: Michelle Brantley was rushed to hospital early to give birth just 11 months after delivering her first son

The Hamby boys - Asa and Eli - survived just 34 hours before developing an atrial flutter - where the heart beats of of sync - which sent their heart rate to 300 beats a minute.

Doctors tried to regulate the rhythm with drugs, but ultimately could not save the boys.

Ms Brantley wrote a tribute to the Hamby family on Facebook: 'Our hearts go out to the Hamby family, although yalls precious baby boys only spent one day on earth, they will spend a life time watching over you guys from heaven above.

'We're praying for your family now and forever. Please everyone pray for the Hamby family, they need your prayers. R.I.P Angel babies! ‪#‎teamHamby‬.'
