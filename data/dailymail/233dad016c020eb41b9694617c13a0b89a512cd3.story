With people increasingly using social media websites to sell all kinds of stuff, Instagram is growing in popularity as a digital marketplace for people trading in firearms.

Traditionally the photo-sharing app, which was bought by Facebook last year for $1 billion, was a forum for people to show off their glamorous lifestyles but that’s changing as users realize it can be just as effective for more shady dealings.

With no stated policy barring firearm sales - unlike established e-commerce site such as Ebay or Craigslist - both dealers and enthusiasts are exploiting the situation to privately buy and sell guns with next to no need for background checks, license verifications, etc.

A simple search on the increasingly popular photography app reveals a host of semi-anonymous dealers advertising, negotiating, and selling firearms, claims The Daily Beast.

Users can easily find ‘a chrome-plated antique Colt, a custom MK12-inspired AR-15.tricked out with “all best of the best parts possible,” and an HK416D .22LR rifle’  by combing search words and hashtags, like  #rifle, #ar15 or #forsalegun, the report notes.

With no federal law banning online sales and differing, loophole-ridden state laws, Instagram is providing an unregulated market that is a cause for concern for gun control advocates.

‘We are definitely concerned about the public safety implications of unregulated online gun sales, primarily the ability of sellers to skirt background checks and trafficking in firearms - both legal and illegal guns - to prohibited persons,’ Sam Hoover, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told The Daily Beast.

In the meantime a wide array of weapons including handguns, shotguns and even assault rifles are for sale and the Instagram users selling them aren’t really doing anything that is illegal.

The directness of many of the transactions is shocking. 

‘LWRC 10’ SBR FOR SALE!!! Come get it! Includes AAC suppressor tip, ergo grip, 3 magpul pmags, 2 40 round mags, bungee sling, and about 500 rounds of .556. Message me if interested,’ reads one example.

Another user is offering a '243 Winchester savage for sale 400 best offer call if ya want' and then simply provides a number for interested parties to call.

One Instagramer is offering a ‘brand new Romanian 47 7.62 with 2 mags and bayonet, only 100 rounds through it. $650, any takers?’

The occasional post is more candid and might state 'sale must be legit background check, all papers filled legally.'

Negotiations over a sale often start in the comments section – free for all to see since Instagram doesn’t monitor - before the two parties take things offline to email, text message or phone call to discuss further.

The law surrounding the sale of guns within the U.S. is complex and full of loopholes.

The sale of guns between private persons, is largely permitted by law as long as said persons aren’t making transactions on a regular basis.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) encourages both parties to finalize the sale through a licensed gun dealer who can run a background check, but it depends on the state regarding if that step is carried out.

Individuals are largely permitted to freely sell guns to other private citizens within their state, but it is a crime to sell a firearm to any individual known to be prohibited from possessing such items (such as convicts, fugitives, and drug addicts).

Federal law also prohibits so called 'straw purchases,' when a buyer purchases the firearm from a federal firearms license holder for somebody else - as long as it isn’t a gift.
