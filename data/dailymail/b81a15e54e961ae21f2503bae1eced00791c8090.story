A Detroit man convicted in the kidnapping and brutal murder of his girlfriend's 5-year-old niece was sentenced today to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

A jury in December found Darnell Cheatham, 23, guilty of first-degree felony murder, arson, child abuse and other charges in the July 2011 death of Mariha Smith. An earlier jury deadlocked in July.

According to prosecutors, Cheatham took Mariha from her east side home, then raped and strangled her. 

Justice for Mariha: Darnell Cheatham (left), 23, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole in the brutal 2011 rape and murder of his girlfriend's 5-year-old niece, Mariha Smith (right)

Guilty: Darnell Cheatham, pictured in a yellow jumpsuit at his sentencing Tuesday, was convicted of first-degree felony murder, arson, child abuse and other charges last month 

Mother's regret: Mariha Smith's mother Konesha Smith, right, said in court Tuesday it hurts her to think that she trusted her sister's boyfriend around her children

They said he crushed her skull and set her body on fire on a mattress in a vacant house about a mile from her home.

Wayne County Circuit Judge Ulysses Boykin handed down the mandatory sentence under Michigan law Tuesday.

'My daughter is dead at 5 years old,' Konesha Smith told the judge before the sentencing. 'She couldn't enjoy her life. She couldn't see her little brothers and sisters anymore. 

'It hurt me so bad that I trusted him around my kids and this is the way he did me.'

Mariha's father, Curtis Smith, also got a chance to speak during Cheatham's sentencing, telling the court that he had found out that he had a daughter only a short time before Mariha's death, reported The Detroit Free Press. 

'I never had a chance to tell my daughter I love her, touch her, even hold her and tell her that I'm her dad,' he said. 

Horrific find: The burned body of Mariha was discovered in this abandoned Detroit house near to her home in July 2011 

Bad parenting: Konisha Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out drunk 

Defense lawyer Kareem Johnson told the judge that the outcome of the retrial was 'an absolute travesty of justice' and said the testimony of the witnesses 'changed dramatically between the first trial and the second trial.'

'From the very first time I met Mr. Cheatham, he has maintained he had nothing to do with what happened to that young lady.' Johnson said.

Asked if he wanted to speak, Cheatham told the judge: 'Ain't nothing I can say. ... I said all I could say. Nobody believed me.'

'There really isn't anything I wanted to editorialize on because this is a very horrific situation,' Boykin told Cheatham. 'That's been done, the jury has issued its ruling, and all I can do is sentence.'

The judge then issued the life sentence for murder and lesser sentences for the other crimes, among them arson, torture, child abuse and disinterment and mutilation of a body. 

Police said Cheatham abducted Mariha from the house she shared with her mother, Konesha, and aunt, Quanita, who he was in a relationship with.

Maintaining his Innocence: Defense lawyer Kareem Johnson slammed the outcome of the retrial as 'an absolute travesty of justice,' and said that his client has always insisted he had nothing to do with Mariha's death 

Konisha Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out on a sofa after a night of drinking.

While the search for her daughter was still in progress, the then 24-year-old told CBS Detroit that she had last seen Mariha when the little girl and her three siblings settled down for the night on the living room floor.

It was not until two years later that Quanita Smith has revealed to investigators that on the night of Mariha's disappearance, she awoke to find the little girl lying in bed on top of her boyfriend.

She said she didn't anything about it because she was too drunk.

The child's badly burned body was found July 24, 2011, inside a fire-ravaged abandoned home in the 2900 block of Waverly, about a mile from her house.

The toddler had been raped and her skull had been crushed. The cause of death was asphyxiation.
