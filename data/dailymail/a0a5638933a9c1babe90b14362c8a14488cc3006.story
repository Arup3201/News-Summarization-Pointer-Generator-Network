A developer and city officials say some changes have been negotiated in a controversial plan for a so-called 'poor door' that was to be used by less-affluent residents of a new Manhattan skyscraper.

People who live in the pricey condos of the 42-story Upper West Side building will still enter through the luxurious front lobby.

But residents of the 'affordable' portion of the complex - who will pay steeply reduced rent under a government-funded program - will have a separate entrance and exit.

Now, under new plan ammendments, developer Larry Silverstein says those people will have access to a courtyard and a roof deck facing the Hudson River.

Controversial: Workers prepare the main entrance of a new residential building on Manhattan's West Side. Residents of the less-luxurious condos in the complex will use a separate so-called 'poor door'

'Poor door': The separate doors are the result of a change to the zoning rules in 2009 that allowed developers to build multiples building segments on the same site, where each is required to have its own entrance. However many argue it is separatist and unfair

Developing: Known as 10 Freedom Place, the market-rate apartments are perched atop affordable-housing units (picture) in a glass tower

Glassy: The entrance for owners of the market-rate apartments will feature a door man

Making changes: Larry Silverstein, chairman of Silverstein Properties, made changes to the building plans so that affordable-housing residents have access to some of the amenities in the adjacent building, such as the rooftop garden

The 'poor door' will also open up to a planned public park.

It also will feature custom wood and a lobby with a glass facade.

The changes follow outrage over the announcement that 'less valuable residents were being pushed out the back door'.

City officials call the project a model for integrating affordable and market-rate apartments.

But they're also hoping for changes in the law to forbid separate entrances.

In order to get tax breaks or permission to construct major buildings in New York, developers agree to build a certain amount of subsidized housing units in the same area.

State assembly woman Linda B Rozenthaal is working to take away those tax breaks from developers who plan to have separate entrances.  

Controvery: A project a few blocks away from the Silverstein venture, by Extell Development Co. at 40 Riverside Blvd. (puctred), has sparked similar outrage in recent weeks for also including a 'poor door'

'The zoning resolution can be changed so that this kind of set up cannot be legal,' she said.

Until the laws are changed are made, officials will use the recent changes to Silverstein's plans as a precedent. 

'I do think we've made a blueprint,' Vicki Been, commissioner of the Housing Preservation and Development Department, told The Wall Street Journal.

'The blueprint is that you've got to have a building that signals, ''You are welcome here. You are just as valuable as every person in this neighborhood''.'
