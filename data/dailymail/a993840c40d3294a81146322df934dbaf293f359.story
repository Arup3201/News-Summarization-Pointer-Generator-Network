Let's face it, anybody who loses a few pounds, particularly in the tummy area, looks forward to showing off their newly trim abs.

While some might decide to strut their stuff in a bikini, others go a step further and pose in their undies, just like mum-of-two Emma-Jayne Duff who has lost over two stone - after a family holiday motivated her to shed her excess weight.

Feeling great, Emma-Jayne, 31, celebrated her weight-loss with a raunchy boudoir shoot.

At her heaviest, the petite 5ft 1inch blonde tipped the scales at 11st 10lb and was a size 16 but has slimmed to a trim 9st 12lb and a size 10.

Emma-Jayne - who is married to private banker, Graeme, 37 - piled on the pounds after falling pregnant with her two children, Teddy, 6, and Poppy, 4.

The beauty salon owner from St Neots, Cambridgeshire says, 'As a teenager, I was slim. But once I hit my twenties, I started putting on weight after socialising with friends.

'When I met my husband, Graeme, we ate out a lot and my weight started to creep up some more. I then put on 4st with each of my two pregnancies.'

'After that, I always felt like the fat friend next to my slim group of girl pals.

'And despite being happily married and Graeme telling me I was gorgeous, I felt frumpy and didn't believe he could find me attractive.'

It was only after Emma-Jayne went on a family break to Centre Parcs in January 2014 that she decided to ditch the weight for good.

She said: 'While we were on holiday there, we were teaching my son Teddy to ride a bike without stabilizers.

'I was running alongside him and I was so aware of my tummy wobbling. All I felt was how heavy and uncomfortable I was as I ran.

'I also felt fat and frumpy whilst next to my slim sister-in-law at the pool. I thought to myself, I am too young to spend the rest of my life feeling unhappy like this. It was time to make a change.'

Emma-Jayne joined Slimming World as soon as she returned from Centre Parcs. She began a healthy diet and with some determination the pounds began to shift. She also started incorporating exercise into her routine and took up kettlebell workouts twice a week.

She said: 'Since losing the weight, I am so much happier and confident. When Graeme tells me I'm beautiful or sexy now, I believe him!'

Emma-Jayne decided to get the edgy photoshoot after seeing an advert on Groupon.

'I have always been fascinated by 50s pin-ups and old Hollywood glamour so when I saw the advert, I immediately booked myself a shoot.

'In fact, I made a reservation for twelve weeks in advance so it could serve as motivation to work hard and keep losing weight.

'On the day of the shoot in April, I felt nervous. When I was bigger, I would strategically place myself next to friends and family to hide my body. But now I had no-one to hide behind.

'However once I had my hair and make-up done, I felt amazing and within minutes, I was in my element! I absolutely love the photos and I'm really proud of myself.'

Emma-Jayne is so chuffed with the sexy snaps that she has even shared them on Facebook.

'The reaction from friends and family was wonderful. I plan on getting two of the pictures put onto canvas to hang in my bedroom with Graeme.'
