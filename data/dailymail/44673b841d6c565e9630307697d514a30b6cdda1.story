Jamie Murray did his hopes of a Davis Cup recall no harm as the British doubles expert and John Peers won their first-round match at the Australian Open on Wednesday.

In a tight men's doubles opener at Melbourne Park, 16th seeds Murray and Peers eventually came through 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 against the Argentinian pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco.

Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith recently admitted that Murray is in pole position to potentially partner younger brother Andy in the doubles against USA in the World Group first-round tie in Glasgow in March.

And Murray, who has not played Davis Cup for three and a half years, admits that he would love the chance to take on Bob and Mike Bryan on home soil in Scotland.

The 28-year-old said: 'I've certainly had a good start to the year and we've been playing some good tennis. I'm sure I have a decent chance of getting picked and if that happens, brilliant.

'It will be a great tie to play the States in Scotland and great to play with Andy in the doubles against the Bryans. That's a pretty cool thing to experience. I would definitely love to play. But I can't say its in the back of my mind when I'm out there competing.

'If I get picked for the team, great. But I can't really be thinking about that when I am going on the court here to play. You have just got to focus on the task in hand.'

The British/Australian combination of Murray and Peers had the majority of the support out on Court 10 as they raced to the opening set in just 20 minutes, with Murray's net coverage proving impressive.

However, after breaks were exchanged in the early stages of the second set, Murray and Peers missed a number of chances and Gonzalez and Monaco levelled the match by claiming the tiebreak.

The third set remained close until the death when Murray and Peers stepped it up at 5-4 and broke serve to clinch the win in one hour and 54 minutes.

Murray said: 'I think really we should have won the second set. I think we had more than enough chances to do it. Once it got into the tiebreak I think we both got a bit edgy and all of a sudden we were in a third set.

'Last year we lost a lot of matches where we went off and didn't really see it over the finish line. I think for me personally I had that in the back of the mind. Just happy that we got through in the end.'

British doubles No 2 Dominic Inglot also made a successful start to his Melbourne campaign with Romanian Florin Mergea, the 14th seeds defeating Australians Matthew Ebden and Matt Reid 6-2, 6-2.

There was disappointment, though, for Wimbledon 2012 doubles champion Jonathan Marray who lost his first-round match. Marray and Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky were beaten 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) by Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero.
