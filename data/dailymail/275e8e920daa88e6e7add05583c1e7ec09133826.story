Guilty: Al Amin Dhalla, 42, has been jailed after mounting a hate campaign against his former girlfriend

A twisted city worker who terrorised his ex-girlfriend's family - stalking them with a crossbow and setting fire to their home - has been jailed indefinitely.

Al Amin Dhalla, 42, described as a 'narcissistic psychopath', mounted a chilling hate campaign after being dumped by 35-year-old doctor Alison Hewitt, from Brighton, East Sussex.

At one point the police were so concerned for her family's safety that they had to be airlifted from their holiday home on Lundy Island off the Devon coast.

The pair met through an elite online dating agency for professionals and had moved in together a few months later.

But their relationship soured after airlifted Dr Hewitt’s mother, Pamela Hewitt, and stepfather, David Gray voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past.

The couple split after a year, triggering a four-month stalking campaign by Dhalla during which he tried to burn down the family home in Buckinghamshire and hired a private investigator to snoop on her.

Lewes Crown Court heard Dhalla had a ‘deliberate and chilling degree of planning’ in sending poison pen letters to Dr Hewitt’s colleagues and neighbours.

He also set fire to her parents’ home and was eventually found with a cache of weapons including a crossbow in what prosecutor Richard Barton claimed was an attempt to ‘abduct’ Dr Hewitt.

Dhalla, a Canadian national who came 
to Britain in 2009, was arrested by armed police in April last year 
while impersonating a doctor at The Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards 
Heath, West Sussex less than two hours before Dr Hewitt was due to start
work.

The previous day he 
had gained access to the maternity ward where he quizzed her colleagues 
about her rota before returning the next day with a loaded crossbow and a
large knife.

The court 
heard how due to Mr Gray working in the defence systems industry, he is 
required to tell his employers about any changes in his family’s 
circumstances.

Doomed: Dhalla met Alison Hewitt, through an elite online dating agency but their relationship soured after her family voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past

Through his own inquiries and those of his employer, it emerged that Dhalla had lied about his past.

He falsely claimed that he was 35, an orphan and had lived in Britain for several years. He also did not mention a conviction in Canada for assaulting his uncle with a weapon.

His lies led to him being suspended 
from his job in December 2010 and in the same month Dr Hewitt, 37, 
decided to end their relationship.

The
court heard that Dhalla’s behaviour turned increasingly erratic. He at 
first refused to move out of her home, forcing Dr Hewitt’s relatives to 
evict him.

On April 1 last 
year, Mr Gray and Mrs Hewitt went on holiday to Lundy Island, with only a
few friends and family knowing where they were heading.

The
next day, after buying a .22 air rifle, a 1.77 air pistol and two mini 
crossbows, Dhalla was arrested in a field near Chippenham, Wiltshire, 
while doing target-practice.

Inside his specially-adapted van were 
masking tape, tools and details of locations, said by the prosecution to
include Mrs Hewitt and Mr Gray’s holiday spot, their home addresses and
hospitals where Dr Hewitt worked.

He
was charged with offences related to discharging the weapons and freed 
on bail, a decision described by detectives as 'regrettable”.

Days
later, while Mrs Hewitt and Mr Gray were still on Lundy Island, he 
torched their thatched cottage 220 miles away in Buckinghamshire.

After
dousing newspapers with petrol, he set fires by the front and back 
doors, but no-one was hurt, although people were asleep in neighbouring 
homes.

But in a fit of 
frustration at seeing his ex-girlfriend’s family home surrounded by 
police, he drove to a nearby police station at Wing instead and tried to
burn it down.

Dhalla was 
sentenced on nine counts, including two of harassment, arson reckless as
to endangering life, theft and possession of an offensive weapon.

He
was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after sending
letters while in custody to Dr Hewitt threatening suicide.

He was jailed indefinitely for public 
protection and must serve a minimum of six years before he can be 
considered for parole, Lewes Crown Court heard.

Judge Charles Kemp said: ‘Miss Hewitt wanted your relationship to end, but you could not accept that.

‘You
harassed her bombarded her with texts, calls and cards and when her 
mother uncovered the extent of your lies to her you set about harassing 
her.’

‘You sent letters to 
her employers and then your criminal acts became more sinister and 
serious and you took items precious to Alison.’

Judge
Kemp said Dhalla was ‘cool and calculated’ when he attempted to set 
fire to the family’s home in Aylesbury, Bucks in April 2011 and that he 
had a ‘total disregard’ for the safety of others.

The
court heard Dhalla was seen by psychologists from Broadmoor while in 
custody who described him as ‘narcissistic’ and stated he presented the 
traits of a ‘rejected stalker’.

He was described as ‘articulate and intelligent’ but was felt to present a ‘high risk’ of reoffending.

Defence
barrister David Lamming claimed that Dhalla now felt ‘ashamed’ and 
showed ‘remorse’ about his actions but this was disregarded by the judge
who said he felt for Dr Hewitt and her family who had to sit through 
the proceedings and give ‘distressing’ evidence.

Speaking after the sentencing Dr Hewitt’s step-father David Gray criticised the Home Office and Border Agency for allowing Dhalla into the country when he had a previous conviction in Canada for aggravated assault.

Mr Gray said: ‘Mr Dhalla harassed this family and when he didn’t get his way he made three attempts to take our lives.

‘This case has shown yet again the current deficiencies in our border controls.

‘Mr Dhalla should never have been allowed into this country.

‘In discovering his conviction in Canada we informed the Home Office of the threat he posed to us.

‘They ignored our pleas. Even now the UK has no way to stop Mr Dhalla from re-entering the country.

‘It is time the Government took security of its citizens seriously. We are not absolutely certain he is going to be deported after his sentence.

‘We believe this man holds a grudge and he will continue to hold one throughout his life.’
