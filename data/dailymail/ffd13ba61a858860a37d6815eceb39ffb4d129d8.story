Her nasty treatment, her explosive temper and her imperious attitude toward those assigned to her detail have earned former first lady Hillary Clinton the title of the most detested person under the protection of the Secret Service.

And as a result, agents are all too happy to keep Hillary in the dark about Bill’s buxom blonde love and her secret visits to their Chappaqua home,  according to Ron Kessler in his explosive forthcoming book The First Family Detail, published by Crown Forum.

‘Agents say being on Hillary Clinton’s detail is the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service. Being assigned to her detail is a form of punishment.'

Protect me not: If agents driving her went over a bump, she'd swear at them. She has a dual personality that changes when she¿s not making a public appearance, says author Kessler

And her nasty attitude goes all the way back to early days at the White House when Hillary and President Bill Clinton stepped out of Marine One 
helicopter and crossed the lawn holding hands.

But that was all for show. Once they were out of the public eye, it was a scream fest between the couple.

In response to a cheerful ‘Good morning, ma’am’, by a former uniformed officer, Hillary’s response to him was ‘Fuck off’.

‘Hillary was so mistrustful and vengeful,’ a former agent told Kessler.

‘We
 were basically told, the Clintons don’t want to see you, they don’t 
want to hear you, get of the way’, according to a former Secret Service 
agent.

That means hiding behind drapes – anything not to be seen – and 
she was not to be spoken to as well when moving from one location to 
another in the White House, according to former FBI agent Coy Copeland.

She
 jumped all over agents working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s 
investigation of the couple’s involvement in the Whitewater real estate 
development deal.

And then 
she attacked one agent personally and suggested his suit looked 'cheap.'

Kessler maintains her mean spirited nature didn't end with agents.

White
 House deputy counsel Vince Foster, who committed suicide in June 1993,  was on the receiving end of a virulent verbal attack by Hillary.  She disagreed with a legal opinion 
he made and humiliated him in a meeting, stating he would never be more 
than a hick-town lawyer and wasn’t ready for the big time.

‘The
 put-down that she gave him in that big meeting just pushed him over the
 edge’, Copeland says. She blamed Foster for all of the Clinton's 
problems and stated he had failed the couple.

Right hand woman: Huma Abedin, married to disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner, was Hillary's close confidante. She was as rude as Hillary, says the author

Foster
 was just one of many Hillary verbally attacked. She didn’t like law 
enforcement officers or the military, former Secret Service agent Lloyd 
Bulman stated. ‘She was just really rude to almost everybody. She’d act 
like she didn’t want you around, like you were beneath her.'

She went 
years without speaking to some agents.

While
 publicly courting law enforcement organizations, privately she felt 
disdain. She wanted state troopers and local police to wear suits and 
drive unmarked cars. No military aides could wear their uniforms in the 
White House.If agents 
driving her went over a bump, she’d swear at them.

Glad-handing on the road on her Senatorial campaign, when they arrived at a 4-F Club in the land of dairy cows in upstate New York, she saw cows and people in jeans. That enraged her and she asked a staffer, 'What the f*** did we come her for? There's no money here'.

She has a dual 
personality that changes when she’s not making a public appearance.

Queen of mean: Kessler claims that White House deputy counsel Vince Foster committed suicide in June 1993 after a virulent verbal attack by Hillary.  She disagreed with a legal opinion he made and humiliated him in a meeting stating he would never be more than a hick-town lawyer and wasn¿t ready for the big time

Running
 for Senate and on the campaign tour, she was appalled when they arrived
 at locations where the populace was poor. ‘What the fuck did we come 
her for’? she stated.

While
 Chelsea comes off as an angel, very cordial and sweet, Huma Abedin, 
Hillary’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department and traveling 
chief of staff during her campaign for the presidency, is considered as 
vile and rude as Hillary.

‘Huma
 looked down on the agents and treated them as second-class citizens’, a
 former agent stated. If she wasn’t recognized, she would say, ‘Do you 
know who I am’?

In response to her rudeness, they let her carry her own 
luggage – and the first lady’s luggage as well. ‘She’d have four bags, 
and we’d stand there and watch her and say, ‘Oh, can we hold the door 
for you’?

When Hillary is out of their Chappaqua, New York home, writes Kessler, Bill’s lover makes secret visits to some thirty-five miles north of New York City.

Dubbed 'Energizer' by the Secret Service on duty, the mistress has shown up within minutes after Hillary's departure. Someone made a phone call that Evergreen, Hillary’s code name, was now out and the coast was clear for Bill’s lover.

‘Her figure looks great, but her bust doesn’t fit the rest of her figure; it is rather endowed’. Her breasts were ‘very perky and very new and full’. They appear enhanced and don’t match her face, according to the agents stationed at the guard gate who are instructed to just open the gate for her.

‘You don’t stop her, you don’t approach her, you just let her go in’. ‘I let her in many times at the front gate’, another agent confesses. Normally we held a driver’s license or other form of picture ID when visitors were in the residence. Not so in her case’.

Sometimes she brought homemade cookies for the agents, wearing a low cut top and leaning over giving them a full view of her amplified cleavage.

One agent sighted the former president and Energizer sitting on the swing at the back of the house sipping lemonade.

‘Wheels down’ is the forty-five minute warning for Energizer to make a quick getaway. Hillary’s plane has touched down at LaGuardia and she’ll be in Chappaqua directly. On one occasion, Hillary’s agent neglected to make the call to Old House Lane in time creating a scramble and a catastrophic near miss.

No agent in the service wants to be sentenced to Hillary’s detail – considered the worst form of punishment. They lay down their life for hers and there’s no respect for that.
