President Obama is cast in a negative light in the upcoming movie about the Osama bin Laden raid as it opens with 15 graphic minutes of a terror suspect being waterboarded.

Moments later, the screen flashes to a news interview of the then-President elect talking about how he does not believe in torture.

Conservatives were quick to criticize the film Zero Dark Thirty, preemptively proclaiming that it would prove to be a campaign tool for President Obama, but now select critics have actually seen the film, political pundits may be forced to eat their words.

Another criticism of the film was that director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (both of The Hurt Locker fame) received special treatment by the Obama administration during the production stages of the film, but both have denied such claims.

'It was all based on first hands accounts so it really felt 
very vivid and very vital and very, very immediate and visceral of 
course which is very exciting as a film maker,' Bigelow said without revealing any specific sources.

Hints: A trailer for the film shows one agent (Jessica Chastain) watching footage of an intrrogation

Hard to watch: Chastain stars as the tough agent Maya who is present in the first 15 minutes of the film which are filled completely by the torture of a detainee

The film has been 
controversial from its inception but now the hot button issue is the use
of waterboarding rather than the partisan slant.

At one point, an agent tells a 
captured al Qaeda leader that he should just give up early in the 
‘interrogation’ process because it would just be easier.

‘In the end, bro, everybody breaks. It’s biology,’ the agent named Dan, played by actor Jason Clarke, tells a terror suspect.

While the public will have to wait to 
evaluate the torture scenes until the film is released- which will take 
place in select markets on December 19 but not until January 11 
nationwide- TIME Magazine’s Richard Corliss say that the CIA operative’s
methods include the use waterboarding, a dog collar, heavy metal 
soundtracks on full blast throughout the day, and food deprivation.

‘Once you see it, you’ll be writing to your congressman to prevent it from happening again,’ Showbiz411 critic Roger Friedman says of the waterboarding of a suspected terrorist.

It is in the context of the waterboarding debate where President Obama makes his sole appearance in the film, as the screen flashes to a real 2008 news clip where he says that he doesn’t believe in torture.

Though it is unclear which news clip is used in the film, there are plenty to choose from. One of the clearest examples is a sit-down interview that the then-President-elect had with 60 Minutes just days after he won the presidency in November of 2008.

During the lengthy interview, Obama asserts: 'I have said repeatedly that America doesn't torture and I'm going to make sure we don't torture.'

Possibility: In Zero Dark Thirty, a news clip from 2008 shows then-President-elect Obama talking about his stance against torture. He said so repeatedly, including during the pictured interview with 60 Minutes

Though the film claims to avoid the partisan nature of the debate on what torture should be condoned to allow for the retrieval of critical information, the juxtaposition of Obama's statement against torture next to 15 gritty minutes of a waterboarding scene shows a clear disconnect between what what was being said on the issue and what was actually happening.

He stood by this belief as he transitioned into office, and one of the first executive orders that he signed banning torture techniques- even explicitly citing waterboarding as one that was outlawed- during his first week in office.

The framing of the President’s stance in the film comes as a bit of a surprise to many, since he and his administration reportedly allowed the filmmakers- director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal- access to a number of classified information.

Once news broke of the 
administration’s willingness to work with the Hollywood heavyweights- 
Bigelow won the Oscar for Best Director and Boal for Best Writing for 
their work on The Hurt Locker- Republicans cried afoul.

Congressman
Peter King, the Republican head of the House Committee on Homeland 
Security, called for an investigation into whether or not the filmmakers
were given confidential information during the making of the 
blockbuster.

Adding to the expected outcry, The Center for Responsive Politics
reports that there was one Kathryn Bigelow who donated $200 to the 
Obama campaign in 2011- right when she would have been working on the 
film- though she has not publicly supported any political candidates in 
the past.

Waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the CIA in their interrogation of terror suspects.

The specifics of the tactics differ, but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head.

It is thought to simulate drowning, and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die.

The official stance on it's use has varied over the years, though the CIA has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three al Qaeda operatives, including self-proclaimed '9/11 mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

In an interview with ABC's Nightline, Bigelow and Boal said that they never asked any politicians for any top-secret information.

'I certainly did a lot of homework, but I never asked for classified material. To my knowledge I never received any,' Boal said, as he was the one to research and write the screenplay.

'I picked up the phone and started calling sources and asking them what they knew and taking referrals and knocking on doors and really approached it as comprehensively as I could,' he told Nightline.

'(The CIA agents) were proud of what they had done, but they had more or less resigned themselves to the fact that what they had done is not something they could talk about publicly.

'But one of the things a movie allows people to do is talk in a way that is a little bit freer because they know that movies can change the way people look, [and] that I don't have quite the same standards of having to reveal sources as I would if I was, let's say, running a front page piece in the New York Times.'

King’s knee jerk reaction against Obama administration involvement may have been too soon, however, as the full extent of the film’s depiction of torture was not fully realized until a critic’s screening took place over the weekend.

Hints of the inclusion of torture came in the second version of the trailer, which opens with the voice of an agent presumably warning a detainee.

‘Can I be honest with you? I am bad news. I'm not your friend, I'm not going to help you, I'm going to break you,’ the American actor says.

In another clip, the film’s lead, 
actress Jessica Chastain who plays the intense CIA agent Maya, is seen 
watching footage of an interrogation where the suspect has a cloth 
covering his head as his hands are bound behind the chair.

According
to the TIME review, Maya sits quietly as Dan tortures the suspect named
Ammar. At one point, Ammar turns to Maya pleading 'your friend is an 
animal. Please help me,' but she allows it to continue.

According to the critics, the film’s focus on the decade-long hunt for the terrorist mastermind takes the attention away from the partisan politics and onto the true facts of what took place in the years, and eventually, final days leading up to the killing.

‘I knew the second I read the script and I was learning things, I knew that it was going to be a hot-button issue,’ Chastain previously told The Wrap.

‘Even when we were shooting, there was great care to be as respectful to the story as possible. For me, that was the most important thing: that we tell the right story for history’s sake.’

For the director, that meant the jarring waterboarding scenes, which she said were the most difficult to film.

‘I wish that it wasn't a part of history, but it is and was,’ she said.
