Banned: Mangos from India are set to disappear from British shelves after an EU ruling

It’s the exotic fruit known for its sweet, perfumed flesh and is adored by top chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.

But mangos imported from India are set to disappear from our shelves amid fears that shipments contain a pest that could destroy British tomato and cucumber crops.

The news has infuriated Asian shopkeepers and restaurant owners, who stand to lose thousands of pounds due to a European-wide ban on the fruit that begins on Thursday.

About 16million mangos from India are imported by the UK in a market worth nearly £6million a year.

The EU move – backed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – could not come at a worse time. The peak season is about to begin for the more expensive alphonso variety, known as the king of mangoes and used in puddings and the popular smoothie mango lassi.

The ban has been introduced because some mango shipments have contained tobacco whitefly, which could affect Britain’s £320 million-a-year salad industry.

Monica Bhandari, of importers Fruity Fresh (Western) Ltd, based in West London, said her firm would lose out significantly and added: ‘It’s madness. Mangos will be burned in India because there will be no market for them.’

Jay Rayarel, manager at ATC Retail in Leicester, which sells 36,000 alphonso mangos a week when they are in season, said his firm would lose business worth £200,000, adding: ‘The ban will be devastating.’

Environment Minister Lord de Mauley said he was working closely with his Indian and EU counterparts to resolve the issue.

In a recipe for chocolate mousse with chilli and mango, Gordon Ramsay says: ‘If you can get a sweet, perfumed alphonso mango in season so much the better.’

The EU ban is also set to hit supplies of Indian aubergines, gourds and patra leaves.
