A man spent over $32,000 to turn the bedroom of his New York City apartment into a 1980s-style arcade - but ended up alone when he and his fed-up fiancee called it quits.

Avid game lover Chris Kooluris, 37, works for a PR firm and decided to change the bedroom of his Murray Hill-area apartment after reading a book called Ready Player One, he told Wired.

'It awoke a monster in me' he told the website. 'I just had this revelation that, you know, why shouldn’t I—in this short time that we’re here—surround myself with the things I really enjoy?'

Kooluris was engaged to a woman and moved into her Brooklyn apartment - but received no offers when it went on the market, Wired reported. He decided to hang on to his own place and redecorate it - and it quickly grew into an obsession.

'There’s a fine line between a hobby and an obsession, and I think what happened is I just got so consumed by it all,' Kooluris told Wired. 'There probably should be therapists for hobbyists. It can take over.'

The space includes games like Street Fighter II, The Kong Off, Punch-Out!, Tron and Fix It Felix Jr., the fictional game seen in Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.

Action figures are posed on shelves in the room, under posters of Transformers characters. 

Even snacks are on-hand for gamers in retro vending machines.

Kooluris' relationship was strained when the arcade room was finished in February, Wired reported, and his fiancee returned the engagement ring a month later.

Kooluris now sleeps on a futon with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bedding, and hosts weekly game nights with friends.

'Now that my fiancée and I are no longer together, it's hard to enjoy the room as much as I want to,' he told the New York Daily News. 'I always end up thinking about her.'
