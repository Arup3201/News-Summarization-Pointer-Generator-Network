Relaxing by a pool, flying on private jets and preparing for live gigs in front of thousands of screaming fans, this selection of rare pictures give a fascinating glimpse in to the Rolling Stones and Beatles early touring days.

Taken during the British music invasion of the US in the Swinging Sixties, they show behind-the-scenes shots of the iconic bands on the road. 

The limited edition pictures were captured by Bob Bonis, the US tour manager for both the bands from 1964 to 1966. 

The selection includes Mick Jagger relaxing in a swimming pool hotel in a pair of tight red swimming trunks, John Lennon winding down after a show in a stripy jacket and trademark glasses and Paul McCartney flicking through a newspaper on a plane.

The first Beatles tour to the US (in 1964) saw them arrive at New York to an uproarious crowd of 3,000 to greet them. They gave their first live US television two days later, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in more than 23 million households. 

On February 11, 1964, Beatlemania gripped the US as the band played their first concert at the Washington Coliseum in front of more than 8,000 adoring fans. The Beatles returned to the US in August 1964, and again in August 1965 and 1966.

By contrast, the Rolling Stones' first US tour, in June 1964, was in former bass player Bill Wyman's words, 'a disaster'. 

He said: 'When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record (there) or anything going for us.' 

But during the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, producing what would become their first number 1 hit in the UK: their cover of Bobby and Shirley Womack's 'It's All Over Now'. The Stones went on to achieve their first US number 1 in 1965 with 'Satisfaction (I Can't Get No).' 

The original images from the Bob Bonis Archive will be sold on eBay, offering music enthusiasts and collectors the opportunity to  own a piece of rock history.

A spokesman for eBay said: 'As tour manager and friend, Bob Bonis had unprecedented access to life on the road with two of the world's greatest bands. 

'His contribution to rock history is a magnificent collection of more than 5,000 candid photographs of intimate and unguarded moments – from a never-before-seen Rolling Stones recording session at Chess Records Studio in Chicago to the only close up photographs of the Beatles' 1965 stadium performance in Minnesota.'
