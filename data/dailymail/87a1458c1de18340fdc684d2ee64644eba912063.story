A gang of fraudsters swindled more than Â£46,000 from the 'Boris Bike' scheme by making scores of bogus refund payments to their friends, a court heard today.

Nana Boateng, 26, and Jose Dias, 27, allegedly organised sham repayments while working for SERCO, the company who organise the London Cycle Hire programme.

The pair, who worked at the firm's Enfield offices, dishonestly arranged for refunds from the bike scheme to be channeled into the accounts of six friends over a three month period in 2010.

'Recipients': Samuel Njie, 26, left, and Darnel Joseph-Albert, 20, right, are among those said to have had received money from the sham Boris Bike refunds scheme

George Hayden, 29, left, and Sakinah MacAulay, 24, right, have admitted entering into an arrangement and will be sentenced later this year

The two men are jointly charged alongside former colleague Devina Joseph-Albert, 22, with one count of conspiracy to defraud.

They are said to have 'conspired with together and with others unknown to defraud Transport for London by dishonestly arranging for the payment of refunds relating to the Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme to which the recipients were not lawfully entitled.'

Prosecutors claims the three channeled repayments through the accounts of George Hayden, 29, Zakir Bhad, 24, Darnel Joseph-Albert, 20, Samuel Njie, 26, Elizabeth Spencer, 36, and Sakinah MacAulay, 24.

Elizabeth Spencer, 36, is another of the six said to have received payments from the bogus scheme in late 2010

All six are charged individually with entering into an arrangement contrary to section 328 of the Proceeds of Crime act.

Court documents state that each defendant 'entered into or became concerned in an arrangement which they knew or suspected facilitated, by whatever means, the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person.'

The alleged offences took place between September 21 and December 16, 2010.

Dias and Devina Joseph-Albert, both of Clapton, east London, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today for a plea and case management hearing.

Boateng, of (158) Kingsway, Enfield, north London, was not present for the brief hearing as the court heard he was having 'transport difficulties.'

The three men did not enter pleas.

Judge Stephen Robbins adjourned the hearing until March 7 and fixed a trial date for September 24.

The gang allegedly arranged fake refund payments on Boris Bikes between September and December 2010

Darnel Joseph-Albert, also of Clapton, east London, today pleaded not guilty to a single count of entering into an arrangement and will stand trial later this year.

Hayden, Bhad, Njie, Spencer and MacAulay, all pleaded guilty and will be sentenced at the end of the trial.

The Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme was launched in June 2010 and there are currently more than 6,000 bikes and 400 docking stations.
