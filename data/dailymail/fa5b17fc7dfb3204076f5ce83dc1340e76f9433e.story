With their glossy locks, unlined skin and youthful good looks, the X-Factor panel putting the contestants through their paces on this year's show look better than ever.

But according to one top surgeon, Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mel B and Louis Walsh may owe their good looks to more than just good genes and expensive skincare.

Although Cowell's penchant for Botox is 
an open secret as is Walsh's hair transplant, Anne-Marie Gillett, the non-surgical director at Transform 
Cosmetic Surgery, claims that all four have had more than they admit to.

'It appears that Mel, 39, has gone through 
quite a transformation over the years,' says Gillett. 'Looking at the most recent 
picture, her skin appears very taut, tight and mannequin-like.

'These 
are all classic tell tale signs of recent and long term use of 
injectable treatments.'

Like Mel B, Fernandez-Versini, 31, who has previously denied having Botox, may also have had cosmetic injections and, according to Miss Gillett, has also had some dental work done.

'Her forehead is 
line free, and her eyebrows are slightly more arched in the recent 
picture, both of which indicate that she is possibly having injectable 
treatments,' explains Miss Gillett.

'What
 strikes me most are Cheryl’s teeth. It seems that she has had veneers 
and her teeth are far more aligned and brighter now than in older pictures.'

Although it's widely reported that Cheryl wore Invisalign braces in the past, her current look is possibly the result of extra work, something that the Transform Cosmetic Surgery director describes as a good investment.

'[Her teeth]
have most certainly been her best investment and have significantly 
altered her overall look.' But adds Miss Gillett, Fernandez-Versini's good looks aren't entirely the work of surgeons. 'Cheryl
 has always had great skin,' she explains.

'Fantastic care and, possibly, minimal use of 
injectables has resulted in a polished and refined look. Cheryl looks
 her age and fantastic for it.'

Cowell, 54, is also singled out for his enduringly good skin. 'Simon Cowell looks great for his age and what a head of hair he has,' says Miss Gillett.

'Looking at these pictures, it seems that he’s also been indulging in some non-surgical treatments of late. Simon works in a very image based industry - non-surgical treatments are standard for anyone who works in TV and has their picture taken regularly.

'You’d expect anyone with this type of work to have a good skincare regime and although it’s worked for Simon, we would always advise people not to overdo it – in particular when it’s injectables.'

Surprisingly though, it's the seemingly low-maintenance Louis Walsh, 62, who appears to have had the most invasive treatments, with Miss Gillett arguing that his fresh-faced looks are the result of an eye lift.

Walsh, who in 2011 admitted to having a £30,000 hair transplant, has previously declared himself 'open' to the idea of having surgery and has said Cowell has encouraged him to have his eye bags sorted out.

According to Miss Gillett, the Irish judge now appears to have taken Cowell's advice. 'The more recent pictures also seem to show signs of him having had a blepharoplasty (an eye lift), which is a surgical procedure to remove and tighten the loose skin from the eye area.

'Popular with men of his age, it results in a more youthful and fresher appearance. I would expect him to indulge in non-surgical treatments such as Botox too, as his forehead is looking smooth and line free.'

Walsh, although happy to admit to his hair transplant, has always denied having Botox, saying he would 'never stick poison in his face' and instead putting his youthful looks down to good genes - something that Miss Gillett agrees with.

'He looks great for his age,' she added. 'His overall look is more polished and brighter, which translates well on camera, giving him a much fresher appearance.
