Authorities say several fights broke out among hundreds of teens who packed a western Pennsylvania shopping center, forcing it to close early and it seems to be a trend cutting across malls in America. 

Several altercations erupted on Friday evening at the Monroeville Mall.

Monroeville Police Chief K. Douglas Cole says at least two people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, reported Action 4 News.

Cole says large groups of teens began showing up around 5 p.m., with the crowds swelling to as many as 1,000, according to mall security officers. 

Cole says he doesn't believe it was an organized event or protest and that it's unclear as to why the teens were congregating at the mall or fighting with one another. 

Monroeville Police Chief Doug Cole said, 'It appeared to be no set type of protest it was just that there were many juveniles.' 

Employees say stores closed early after fights were reported around 8 p.m. Cole reports minor damage to the mall, including to kiosks.

Cole says he expects officers to issue disorderly conduct citations. He says two arrests for fighting were related to an earlier domestic dispute.

Kyle Edwards, 18, who works at the American Eagle at the mall saw the flight unravel.

'There were quite a few people fighting,” he told The Blaze. 

'I walked back in the store and said, "This is really bad."'

Fights have been popping up in malls across America reports ABC.   

Brawls also broke out among shoppers at a packed Sacramento mall on the day after Christmas, authorities said on Friday.

The Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento closed more than an hour early because of repeated fights at the food court among a group of over 20 people, the Sacramento Bee reported.

We started having groups who were confrontational with other groups,' said Arden Fair Mall's security chief Steve Reed.

Sacramento Police dispatch supervisor Priscilla Gomez said mall security and a dozen city police officers rushed to the crowded mall. They moved the crowd downstairs, she said, and smaller fights erupted.

About 90 minutes after the first melee, the second broke out in the same area, sending officers back to break up the fight.

Nobody was hurt, but Reed said several people were detained and two people were arrested. 

ABC reports that in Missouri, at the Independence Center, there were also fights and police barricaded the entrance.

A police officer there said, 'We take that very seriously that's why we were able to get a large police presence here very quickly.'
