A U.S. filmmaker who has a Jewish father and Christian mother today decided to convert to Islam in Iran, where he is making a documentary.

But Sean Stone, 27, son of Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone, insisted the switch did not signal him abandoning the faiths of his parents.

He became a Shiite Muslim on Tuesday and has reportedly chosen to be known by the first name of 'Ali', but will not reveal why he converted.

‘The conversion to Islam is not abandoning Christianity or Judaism, which I was born with,’ Mr Stone told news agency Agence France-Presse.

‘It means I have accepted Mohammad and other prophets,’ Mr Stone added from Isfahan, Iran, where the conversion ceremony was carried out.

He is working on a film about Rumi, a mystic poet, and has defended Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the past, reported Foreign Policy.

He has been in 12 films directed by his father - more than any other actor or actress has ever managed, according to film database IMDB.

To make the conversion he recited the Islamic profession of the faith known as the ‘Shahada’ in Isfahan, reported the Tehran Times.

He performed this recital at the office of Shia cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Nasseri Dowlatabadi, reported the Iranian newspaper.

Mr Stone was at a film-makers' conference earlier this month on Hollywood cinema in Iran, which was attended by President Ahmadinejad.

The ‘destructive effects on family foundation’ caused by Hollywood was discussed at the event, reported the Islamic Republic News Agency.
