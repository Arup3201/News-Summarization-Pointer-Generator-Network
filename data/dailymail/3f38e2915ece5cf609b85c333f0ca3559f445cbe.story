AFL footy legend James Hird is selling his Melbourne mansion and is tipped to get $2 million more than he purchased the palatial property for three years ago.

The suspended Essendon Bombers coach, who will return to the club in two weeks, bought the five-bedroom property in the affluent suburb of Toorak for $2.76 million in 2011 and is predicted to go under the hammer for up to $4.75million on Saturday according to domain.com.au.

However, Property Observer has reported that the house has been on the market since February this year and with expressions of interest due on March 25. This followed a failed expressions of interest marketing campaign back in May 2012.

The lavish home at 7 Toorak Avenue is believed to be an investment property for the Hird family who have been living in another Toorak house since 1998 which was purchsed for $2.4million.

The 837 square metre site has been luxuriously renovated and is located just a stone’s throw from Kooyong Village.

Among the elaborate features are French limestone fireplaces, Swarovski crystal chandeliers and a sparkling turquoise pool surrounded by manicured gardens.

The sale comes just a few weeks after the couple and their children returned from a four-month holiday in France amid controversy surrounding Hird’s future with the Bombers following the doping scandal within the club.

But it has been decided although Hird will return to the club when his 12-month suspension ends on August 25, he will not play an active role as coach until the start of the 2015 season.
