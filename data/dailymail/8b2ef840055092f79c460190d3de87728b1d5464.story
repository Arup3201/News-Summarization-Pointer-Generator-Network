While some brunettes may favour the Snow White beauty formula – with ivory skin, ebony lashes and scarlet lips – I'm definitely a golden girl.

Bronzer, glitter and glistening gold-hued products will always catch my eye.

Beauty purists may claim 'golden goddess' make-up is really for blondes, but I say, heck, if it works, wear it!

Binky has never kept her love for bronzer quiet and now that it's summer it's her time to shine

I've never made any secret of my passion for bronzer, and now summertime is here, it's my moment to shine.

Shimmering golden make-up really enhances a suntan and it looks dazzling by night. So this week, I asked my beauty guru – top celebrity make-up artist Daniel Sandler – to help me create a 24-carat look.

Step One: Glisten

Apply your normal base, to create an even canvas for your golden sheen. According to Daniel, the secret with this look is to use colours that are a little warmer than your natural skin tone - I like using Guerlain's Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation in Brunettes.

Using your fingertip, blend Daniel Sandler Watercolour Crème Bronzer in Riviera over the apples of your cheeks, adding warmth and subtle shimmer to your face. Next up, smooth the same product across your eyelids and lips – it's so versatile and easy to apply, and it instantly adds a gorgeous sexy shimmer.

Step Two: Shimmer

Using a small eyeshadow brush like Daniel Sandler Blending Brush, apply Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Nude Beam to your eyes, blending a light wash of shimmer above the lashes, across the centre of your lids and at the inner corners.

This gorgeous peachy shade contrasts beautifully with the bronzer, shaping and adding depth to your eyes. Then, using a bigger brush, dust a hint of this glam glitter across your cheekbones, to highlight the contours of your face and catch the light as you move.

These are some of the products that Binky recommends in order to achieve the ultimate gorgeous glow

Step Three: Bronze

You've added plenty of shimmer already, so stick to a matt bronzer next, dusting it under your cheekbones with a fluffy brush to shape your face - one I recommend is the Real Techniques Blush Brush.

Build the colour up slowly across your cheeks and, if you're after a really pro finish, along each side of your nose and at your temples.

Step Four: Finishing Touches

A slick of Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet, lashings of Daniel Sandler Jumbo Jet Mascara, and a brow pencil like Too Faced Brow-Nie Brow Pencil will complete your eyes. Finally, slick Daniel Sandler Luxury Lip Gloss in Skinny Dip across your lips, slicking it over the top of the gilt shimmer you applied at the beginning.

This luscious, cinnamon-flavoured gloss is the perfect nutty-nude shade – subtle, yet super-glam. Another great alternative is the gorgeously nude Michael Kors Sporty Lip Luster in Muse.

Step Five: The Body Beautiful

Why stop at your face? If you want to glow from head to toe, smooth Rimmel Sunshimmer Instant Tan over your limbs and torso.

This is one of my favourite summer products – it's so easy to apply, it blends in smoothly and is water-resistant, giving your body an instant healthy colour all over.

Now there's no point having a glowing bronzed bod if you're not going to show it off! I'm very happy with my body at the moment as I've been working out and eating well, alongside taking Forza Raspberry K2 supplements.

These Forza pills helped me get the sculpted physique of my dreams and even gave me the confidence to pose for my first lingerie shoot with Bluebella. They're my dieting Holy Grail!

You'll find all the beauty products I used at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. I love this look - it's a really easy one to achieve, and one that suits every skin tone – so give it a try. After all, every girl deserves her Golden Goddess moment. Shine on!
