A San Francisco man was saved Tuesday morning after he woke up screaming inside the back of a recycling truck. 

Truck driver Mike Jones 'heard this gentleman pounding in the back of the truck,' Robert Reed, a spokesman for waste company Recology, told NBCBayArea.

'He actually talked to the gentleman from the cab of the truck and said "I’m going to drive you to the fire station,"" Reed said.

Rescued: A homeless man reportedly wound up inside a garbage truck because he fell asleep inside a dumpster

Firefighters helped the man out, who reportedly fell asleep inside a garbage dumpster before the awakening, the station said.

'If [Jones] hadn’t heard him, he would have been trapped in that all day long and may have died,' Battalion Chief Kevin Smith told NBCBayArea. 'So he is a hero. He saved his life.'

The victim's shoulder was injured by a hydraulic system inside the truck, NBCBayArea reported.

''It’s probably an 8-foot tumble,' Reed told SFGate. 'There was probably already cardboard in the truck so he probably fell on that. And then there was probably cardboard that fell on top of him.'

The homeless man is now in 'stable condition' at San Francisco General Hospital, SFGate reported.
