A husband and wife have been charged in the death of their 9-year-old son, whose decomposing body was found in a 'feces-covered room' in their home this past August.

Police filed criminal homicide charges earlier today against Kimberly A. Tutko and Jarrod N. Tutko Sr., of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, saying their neglect caused the death of their son Jarrod Jr.

Jarrod Jr., who was diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome as an infant, weighed just 17 pounds at the time of his death, and had been locked in his bedroom by his parents.

Special needs: Jarrod Jr. (above as an infant) had been diagnosed with Fragile X Syndrome

His cause of death was determined to be malnutrition and neglect. 

Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico said Monday that Jarrod Jr. was in what he called a horrible condition at the time of his death in July.

'To think of this young boy in that room day in and day out, locked in there like an animal, left to fend without food, without nourishment,' Marsico told WHTM-TV.

'It's as horrific a case as we can imagine for someone that innocent.'

A 10-year-old girl who was close to death was also found in the home and needed urgent medical attention.

Authorities allege that both parents failed to provide 'even the most basic needs' of the child. 

Jarrod Jr. suffered from a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment as a result of his syndrome.

According to The Patriot-News the couple, who have six children between the ages of three and 13, have a lengthy, and chilling, history with Children and Youth services. 

Kimberly, 39, also has three children from her first marriage she gave up her parental rights to.

Jarrod Jr. was taken from his parents custody multiple times over the course of his life, and when, in 2005, a doctor advised Jarrod Sr., 38, to take his son to the hospital because of his 'history of losing weight and developmental delays,' he said 'No' and hung up the phone according to court records.

Another court document states that a sibling told one case worker who recently visited the home that Jared Jr. had a wet forehead because he 'had feces on himself which the father had attempted to wash off.'

She also stated, 'dad doesn't care about Jarrod Junior anymore,' according to the complaint.

The room the boy was found in had 'feces-covered floors and walls, a non-working light, no furniture but a television and a doorknob that locked from the outside.'

Both parents were aware of their son's deplorable living conditions.
