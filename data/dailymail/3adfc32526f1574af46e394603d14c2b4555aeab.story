Ed Miliband came under renewed attack from his  own party yesterday after a second leading MP openly criticised his lack of policies and direction.

Graham Stringer, a high-profile backbencher and former government whip, said he was worried about the ‘deafening silence’ of the Labour leader and his shadow cabinet over the summer.

He said their failure to set the agenda or attack the Government was a ‘huge missed opportunity’, which he put down to their ‘lack of coherent policies’ in key areas such as welfare.

Criticised: Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, has been blasted by backbencher Graham Stringer

Mr Stringer said the ‘real worry’ for Labour was not a leadership challenge, but the inactivity of Mr Miliband’s top team over the past few weeks – traditionally a time for the opposition to criticise the Government’s record while ministers are on holiday.

In a broadside against his leader, he said: ‘A huge opportunity is being missed. The second worry is that I don’t believe members of the shadow cabinet are being lazy – I think it is stemming from a lack of coherence and cogency of our policies.

‘It’s not quite clear what our policies on welfare are, what our policies on housing are, what our policies on education are.

‘Although I don’t expect Ed Miliband and the shadow cabinet to write out precisely what is going to be in our manifesto in 20 months, I do expect the public should be told, and the party should be able to support, clear and coherent policies.’

Return? There have been calls to bring Peter Mandelson back into the fold for Labour

He added that there were ‘serious concerns’ among MPs about the ‘lack of activity in the shadow cabinet’, and suggested deep divisions about the party’s direction, saying the impression that it was united was a ‘mirage’.

His criticism follows a warning at the weekend from shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who said Labour faced defeat at the next election if the party did not come up with a vision for the economy within a few months.

He said voters were ‘not convinced we have the answers’.  One frontbencher said yesterday Labour was ‘leaping into traps’ set by the Tories over welfare, the economy and immigration.Labour have been without an election strategist for weeks after Tom Watson resigned in the furore over union influence.

While Mr Miliband has yet to name a replacement, the Tories have the services of Boris Johnson’s ex-campaign manager Lynton Crosby and have snapped up Jim Messina, who ran Barack Obama’s last victory.

A poll yesterday put Labour on 36 per cent, the Tories on 29 per cent, UKIP on 17 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

Speaking on Radio 4 yesterday, Mr Stringer said the party should consider bringing back veteran spin doctor Peter Mandelson to firm up their message.

He added: ‘Labour needs to get the best person. When Peter Mandelson held that position the party was more coherent in getting its message across.’

Mr Miliband is said to be planning a frontbench reshuffle in September to create a more dynamic top team.
