A British soldier has been charged over claims he made a nail bomb and had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook.

Ryan McGee, 19, was detained while serving in Germany with 5th Battalion the Rifles after a suspicious device - understood to be a nail bomb - was found at his home in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Prosecutors say he had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook, the controversial 1971 manual which contains instructions on making bombs and manufacturing illegal drugs.

McGee was arrested on December 2 last year at Paderborn Garrison in Germany and detained in military custody before being returned to Britain, where Greater Manchester Police arrested him under the Terrorism Act.

McGee's unit uses the Warrior fighting vehicle â€“ one of the most potent battlefield weapons in the infantry.

The soldier would have had the opportunity to learn how to drive the 40-tonne Warrior, which has been used in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans.

The Rifleman was bailed last year while police carried out further investigations and today he was charged with two offences - one of making an explosive device and another of possessing a document, namely the Cookbook, for the purposes of terrorism.

He has been held in custody and will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court next Wednesday.

Jane Stansfield, of the Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division, said: 'This decision to prosecute was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.'

She added: 'It is alleged that between
 May 31 2012 and November 29 2013, Ryan Adam McGee had possession of a 
document or record for terrorist purposes, namely a copy of The 
Anarchist Cookbook.

'He has been charged with one offence contrary to Section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000.

'It
 is also alleged that Ryan Adam McGee, between September 1 and 30 2013 
made an improvised explosive and has therefore also been charged with 
one offence contrary to Section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883.'

The Anarchist Cookbook, first published in 1971, contains instructions for the manufacture of explosives as well as for home manufacturing of illicit drugs.

It was written by former New York bookshop manager William Powell, who said he wanted to express his anger against the U.S. military's presence in Vietnam.

The book reportedly sold more than two million copies but became notorious for its use by militants and terrorists.

In December last year, Powell wrote an
 article for the Guardian in which he expressed regret for writing the 
book and called for it to go out of print.

'Over the years, I have come to understand that the basic premise behind the Cookbook is profoundly flawed,' he wrote.

'The anger that motivated the writing of the Cookbook blinded me to the illogical notion that violence can be used to prevent violence.'

The armoured infantry regiment is based at Paderborn and is equipped with the Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle.

The regiment has recently served on numerous operations including Iraq, Afghanistan and The Balkans.

An Army spokesperson would not confirm whether McGee was still officially a member of the armed forces.

She added: 'We are aware Rifleman McGee has been charged today. We have assisted Greater Manchester Police with their investigation, and as the case continues it would be inappropriate to comment further.'
