A neon pink-clad Gwen Stefani played host to Michelle Obama yesterday, with a family-friendly fundraiser at her LA home.

The First Lady was guest of honour at the party, titled Sunday of Fun. It was attended by 400 people, each paying upwards of $2,500 for a family of four.

The event was the latest in a string of star-studded Obama fundraisers, including one attended by the President in Connecticut at the home of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein last week, and another in New York hosted by Anna Wintour and Sarah Jessica Parker last month.

Among the guests were designer Clare Vivier, who snapped a photo of Mrs Obama and Ms Stefani walking together at the event.

Captioned: 'Power Women', it showed 
the singer looking typically glamorous in a neon pink jumpsuit. Mrs 
Obama also looked elegant in a knee-length navy dress.

Us Weekly
reports that Nicole Richie and husband Joel Madden both attended with 
their two children. Television star Alyson Hannigan and her family were 
also in attendance.

One
celebrity who was unexpectedly absent was Ms Stefani's rocker husband
Gavin Rossdale who is currently on the European leg of his band's tour.

'I want to thank Gwen, in 
particular, for being so kind and gracious and hosting us all here at 
her beautiful home. And even though Gavin [Rossdale] couldn't be here, I
also want to say a special thank you to him as well, and also to 
Kingston and Zuma,' Mrs Obama said.

'I
mean, they are letting all of us just enter their house, all the chaos,
and they're being so good about it today. So thank you, guys, for 
letting us come - indeed.'

The fundraiser had a casual theme that 
was meant to attract families, enticing politically-active parents to 
bring their children along with them for some games and food and 
hopefully a word with Mrs Obama.

In keeping with the theme of the 
event, that chaos included a tennis court arranged with red, white and 
blue balloons in the shape of the American flag.

Surrounding the display, there were stalls arranged for children to get temporary tattoos and balloon animals.

Mrs Obama made a point to speak to both the children and the adults in the audience during her brief remarks.

'Barack can't do it alone. He's not Spider-Man. He's not a superhero. He's a human, so we need your help,' she said.

'I
am not just talking to the adults here today. I am talking to the young
people here as well. All of our young people - you might not be old 
enough to vote. You vote at school, I know - I met several young people 
who are going to be voting for my husband, who are 10 and under - we 
accept those votes,' she said to a laughing crowd. 

'But you can play an important role in this election, too. I want you all to feel empowered.'

Ahead of the event, Ms Stefani 
tweeted her excitement at playing host to the First Lady. She told her 
Twitter followers: 'Getting ready for Michelle Obama to come for a 
Playdate gx.'

She added shortly after: 'The first lady is here!'

But, proving even the yummiest mommies are vulnerable to sartorial mishaps, she admitted: 'Zuma cried all over my pink top! Oh well mom central gx.'

As his wife was partying with Hollywood's A-list in LA, President Obama was hosting another fundraiser at his home in Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood.

He welcomed about 75 of his top donors who 
wished the president a belated happy birthday – No. 51 – and gave big 
bucks to his re-election campaign.

It was part of a full day of hometown
fundraising for Mr Obama, who was expected to haul in $3.5 million to $4 
million to fuel his campaign against Republican Mitt Romney.

'Welcome to my house!' he said, greeting donors, most of whom paid $40,000 per person to attend.

'I have to say, the lawn hasn't looked
this good in a while. But I figured, but at least Michelle figured, 
that if everyone was coming over we ought to neaten up a little bit.'

By dusk, with temperatures in the mid-70s, the president was ready for an evening stroll.

His next fundraiser was at the home of Marty Nesbitt, one of his closest friends, followed by another at the home of Barbara Bowman, the mother of Valerie Jarrett, a longtime adviser and friend.

Nesbitt's home was so close that the president decided to walk, slinging his black blazer over his left shoulder while he was trailed by Secret Service agents and his entourage.

He shook hands with cheering neighbors and gave a local TV crew a presidential shout-out for his favorite baseball team, the Chicago White Sox.
