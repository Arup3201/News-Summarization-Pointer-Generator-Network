An anonymous artist and photographer has captured mundane objects in an entirely new way – making them very difficult to distinguish.

Using a reverse lens macro technique, Pyanek has collated his extreme close-up shots in a series he calls ‘Amazing Worlds Within Our World’.

Featuring an array of household items, foods and objects we use on an everyday basis, the images are striking.

But can you guess what any of them are?

A honeycomb mesh? The product photographed in Pyanek's first image is found in most kitchens around the world

Wafer thin! Pyanek's second image is of a revolutionary item that has been used in this way as far back as AD 105

Is that an onion? Object number three is a cosmetic product that has been used for centuries

The first image is of a super absorbent tool made from an organic compound,  but can you guess what this honeycomb mesh actually is?

Second up looks like a piece of carpet or maybe a row of wafers? Could be both could be neither. The first use of this item in this way dates back to AD 105 and its continued production has helped shape the world, but just what is it?

Number three is a cosmetic product that contains pigments, waxes, oils and emollients. The image itself looks like an onion but it’s a lot more refined than that. Any ideas?

This item is both mundane and overlooked but it does serve a pretty useful purpose

Pyanek used the reverse lens macro technique to photograph this item in all its wiry glory

Created by a doctor and an advocate for vegetarianism, this item is enjoyed by people around the world

Image number four features a mundane and often overlooked object, but in this photograph it looks majestic. A type of fastener characterised by a helical ridge, but just what is it exactly?

Number five features a small and porous bag used for its filtering properties. This item can be found in most homes around the country but we are pretty sure you have never seen it looking like rice noodles before.

The sixth image features an item that was accidentally created in the 19th century by a doctor and advocate of vegetarianism. Today it is produced in significant quantities.

Is that a cinnamon stick? Object number seven is something you would almost certainly overlook

A striking image! Just what exactly is this revolutionary phosphorus item?

This image featuring a series of prisms is majestic, but can you guess what it is?

Image seven captures an item you have almost certainly overlooked in the past, expect for the time you twisted it until it broke off. Any ideas what this cinnamon stick-like thing is? 

Photograph number eight is striking. This phosphorus item has been in existence for centuries and its purpose has revolutionised the world. 

Image number nine features a substance formed by trapping pockets of gas in a liquid or solid. The frames of the prisms in this image appear stable, but we assure you they are much more supple than they look. 

Smooth or sharp? The extreme close-up of this everyday household item is misleading 

The scratches on this useful little item presents the amount of wear and tear it goes through

That looks familiar! This image provides an insight into how this useful everyday item works

Despite the individual lines that appear on the object captured in photograph ten it looks smooth and soft to touch. However, this tool has the capability of producing many small splits and then a large cut to a surface. 

The colour of image 11 really catches the eye, but it’s pitted surface and hard to distinguish edges make it a confusing image to... unlock.

Image 12 is features another object that has revolutionised the world we inhabit. This photograph is perhaps easier to interpret but it provides an insight into how the item works.

This object, which appears wiry up-close, is almost certainly something you would overlook

Majestic: This everyday, throwaway item would appear to command more respect than it actually gets

Just in case you were wondering, this is what a biotic material looks like up-close, apparently

A bit more difficult as object 13 is almost certainly something you would overlook, but it does have its purposes. Any idea what this wiry object is?

Photograph 14 is perhaps the most enchanting image of the piece. The object is practically flawless but for the few pimples that appear on it. Can you guess what this single diamond-like grain is?

Made from a biotic material, object number 15 is used for a variety of purposes and is associated with ritual and religious devotion in China and India.

This long, thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century

Pyanek captures the beauty of this overlooked item by utilising the reverse lens macro technique

X marks the spot! The dirty fingerprints ingrained on this object are a giveaway to what it is

Image 16 features an object traditionally made from durum wheat semolina. This long, thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century and is now considered a staple. Any ideas?

A slightly more difficult object to distinguish, image number 17 picks up the beauty of a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals.

And finally number 18. Something we use every single day with little consideration. This image brings to light a brick-in-the-wall object. The finger prints present are a clue here.
