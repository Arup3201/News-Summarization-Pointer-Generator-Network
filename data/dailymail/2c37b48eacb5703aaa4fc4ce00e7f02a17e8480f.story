FIFA presidential candidate David Ginola hopes to increase equality in football by staging the men's and women's World Cups at the same time. 

The Frenchman believes his idea will take the World Cup and women's football to 'new heights' as he looks to overthrow current FIFA chief Sepp Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term in office.

With the tournaments both  taking place in different countries in different years, the 47-year-old wants to amalgamate the two for 'one global spectacular'.

Despite Ginola's ideas for a reform Sepp Blatter is still odds-on favourite to secure a fifth election victory

'We're talking about equality because we want women to be treated as well as the men,' Ginola told BBC Radio 5 live.

'We want the women's World Cup to be organised and played right after the men's World Cup.

'For example, it would have been in Brazil using the structure of the men's World Cup. It would be interesting to see how we can set this up.'

As it stands, the 2015 Women's World Cup will be held in Canada on June 6, almost a full year after the men's tournament took place in Brazil last summer.

Ginola's presidential bid has the backing of pressure group ChangeFIFA, which has long campaigned for new leadership at the top of an organisation that has faced numerous allegations of corruption.

But the bid is also supported by bookmaker Paddy Power and has been dismissed as a publicity stunt in some quarters.

'This is something real and we will work hard for weeks and months,' Ginola said.

'We will be getting into details this week because we want to restore trust in FIFA.

'I am an independent voice and it's nice to have that different voice in the debate, to say that things can change and to leave a positive legacy behind. 

Ginola's fellow Frenchman Jerome Champagne is also in the running for the job of FIFA president 

FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has also declared an interest in football's top job
