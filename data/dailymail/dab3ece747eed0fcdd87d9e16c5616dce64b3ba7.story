Loved life: Alana Goldsmith was fun-loving, intelligent and successful, but she took her life at a train station in 2011 after fighting a long battle with anorexia nervosa

She was a bubbly beautiful young girl who fell prey to an eating disorder and the family of a young woman who killed herself after a long battle with anorexia says the illness 'starved her brain and destroyed her hopes'.

Alana Goldsmith, of Cammeray on Sydney's north shore, was 23 when she left the hospital where she was receiving care on the afternoon of July 22, 2011 and took her own life at Summer Hill in Sydney's inner-west.

The Goldsmith family requested an inquest following her death, to review patient care and explore the issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners.

On Tuesday, Magistrate Mark Douglass told Glebe Coroner's Court that it had been a 'complex and harrowing matter with many difficulties'.

He made the finding that Alana had taken her own life while suffering from anorexia nervosa but will not publish his reasons until later this month.

Speaking outside the court, Simone Goldsmith said her older sister started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years.

Judy has previously said it's important for families to look for the warning signs of anorexia and to be educated about the disorder

'Alana was a fun-loving, vivacious and intelligent young woman until anorexia nervosa starved her brain and destroyed her hopes and dreams,' she told reporters.

'This silent killer is a highly complex mental illness ... We hope that the findings handed down today bring about meaningful discussions ... that result in more resources and better care.'

Butterfly Foundation CEO Christine Morgan said people with eating disorders need specialised treatment and early intervention.

'This is an illness that kills,' she said. 'It has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness and we cannot ignore that. We need to have effective treatment.

'We need significantly more resources ... we need more care that is in the community and psychologist and psychiatrists.'

On the In Loving Memory of Alana Goldsmith Facebook tribute page Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest.

'We were fortunate to have a very involved coroner who engaged with witnesses about the myriad issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners,' she posted last Thursday ahead of the findings and recommendations.

'We feel positive that this gruelling process will bring about change. Yesterday (last Wednesday) I was given the chance to address the court and go on record on behalf of the family.

'We wanted those present to hear about our fun-loving, clever, vivacious, multifaceted Alana. She is always in our hearts. And to those who continue to struggle, please hold onto hope.'

Life of the party: Alana Goldsmith's 17th birthday at Pymble on Sydney's North Shore was a typically happy affair, but later she fell into the abyss of an eating disorder which slowly chipped away at her

Alana's sister Simone Goldsmith said her older sister started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years

Dux of her school, Alana had a bright future ahead of her and had recieved overseas work offers for Mattel and Google, reported News.com.au.

About two months after Alana's death, Simone said her family wanted the challenge the perception that anorexia was about being thin.

In the wake of their loss, she said the family's aim was to raise awareness of the mental illness, which is 32 times more likely to lead sufferers to commit suicide than their peers.

As Alana battled the disorder, her weight fell to 41 kilograms at its lowest and with a height of 170 centimetres, this gave her an alarming body mass index of 14.Â 

At 15, Alana showed signs of the disorder for the first time, when she returned home from a Year 9 exchange trip to Japan.

Despite her family's shock at her skeletal transformation, Alana blamed her weight loss on her host family not having much food.

Alana's mother Judy said her priority was getting her daughter's weight back up but that the problem was much 'deeper' than this.

In November 2010, Alana returned to Australia from another trip in Japan and was admitted to hospital.

Pictured right, the photo of the 23-year-old was taken on Christmas Eve, 2010, which Alana's mother says 'it was to be our last Christmas with Alana. She had been in Northside Clinic for seven weeks and was trying so hard. Alana had well-deserved leave and we enjoyed a beautiful evening on the deck at Cammeray'

Her smile, her beauty and her kindness: Alana Goldsmith's family started a Facebook page in loving memory of their daughter to help anorexia and eating disorder suffers and others in need

Prior to her death, Alana used her journal while in hospital to document her mental struggles with the disorder.

'I feel really mentally exhausted. Telling myself that it is OK to be here and eating. But then ED (eating disorder) voices tell me I should leave and lose the weight that I have so quickly gained,' Alana wrote.

On the day of her death, Alana left the hospital twice and was not seen by staff. She was found dead hours after leaving for the final time.

Alana's mother Judy did not blame the hospital and said families needed to look for signs of the disorder and to be educated about the disorder.

'It was not the care in hospital, per se -- it was just the lack of monitoring,' Mrs Goldsmith said.

'It's voluntary admission but in the era of occupational health and safety, most institutions know how many people are in the building at any point in time. Why isn't that the case for a clinic dealing with mentally ill people?'
