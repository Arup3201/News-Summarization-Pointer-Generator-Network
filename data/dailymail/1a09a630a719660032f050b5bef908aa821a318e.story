Super fit Real Housewife of Beverly Hills Eileen Davidson braved the icy waters of the Pacific Ocean yesterday and took the Penguin Plunge.

The 55-year old actress, who won the outstanding lead actress Emmy last year for her role on Days of Our Lives, ventured into the 56-degree Pacific ocean in Venice Beach, Calif., to participate in the annual New Year's Day tradition with her husband Vince Van Patten, 57, and family patriarch Dick Van Patten, 86, of Eight Is Enough fame.

Ready set go: Real Housewife Eileen Davidson took the Penguin Plunge on New Year's day

Feeling good: She didn't even hesitate when she dove into the ocean - and even got her hair wet

Togetherness: Eileen and hubby Vince Van Patten  take the challenge together. They have been married since 2003

A family affair: Son Jesse, 11, also joined in the New Year's day festivities

Young at heart: Dick Van Patten's father began doing the challenge and the Van Patten family has continued the tradition. Dick is 86

Eileen was part of the first group of swimmers who swam to a buoy a short distance out. Vince and his older brother Nels did the long distance swim as well.

She was also joined by her son Jesse, 11, his other son Vince Jr, 19, Vince's son from a former marriage.

The temperature in Venice, Calif., was 62 degrees at noon when the event took place

Eileen didn't even hesitate when she got in the water, she dove in and even got her hair wet. She stayed in about two minutes then came out.

Two minutes in the cold: Eileen got completely immersed but she did not hang around

Fast dip: Eileen stayed in the water for two minutes. That was enough as the water temperature was only 56 degrees

Toweling off: The air temperature was 62 degrees when Eileen came out of the water but the sun was shining

Au natural: No wet suits are  allowed on this swim. To participate you must brave the ocean in your regular bathing suit. There were about 100 participants

Eileen was quick to get her son Jesse a towel after the swim.

The Van Patten's are a  close family, and Eileen seems to get along with everyone, even her step-son Vince Jr.

So while Brandi Glanville blasts her as a 'home wrecker' in the new episode of RHOBH, it seems like all these years later it's all good.

Eileen joined the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast in its current season along with Lisa Rinna.

In a recent interview on Access Hollywood Live! the Housewives showed clips from the reality show including the scene where Brandi Glanville throws a glass of wine at Davidson and calls her a home wrecker.

Billy Bush asked Davidson why Glanville would call her that. 

Eileen was having a pretty good hair day as she prepared to take the plunge

Better out than in: it was warmer on dry land than in the 56 degree ocean

Original: Dick Van Patten (above) followed in his father's footsteps to take part in the challenge and now his son and Eileen are doing the same

'Oh, I don't know,' she responded.

Glanville ex-husband is Eddie Ciprian, who famously left her for country singer LeAnn Rimes,  and she particularly sensitive on the subject. Apparently Vince Van Patten was married  was when he met Eileen.

Billy  Bush said Glanville 'seems to be the villain of the show – the pot-stirrer,' to which Davidson replied: 'Yeah, that seems to be her thing.'
