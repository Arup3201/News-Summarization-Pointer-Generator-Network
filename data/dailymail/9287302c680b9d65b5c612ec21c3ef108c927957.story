A puppy that disappeared more than five months ago was saved from Winter Storm Juno and is home safe and sound thanks to the efforts of a New York City firefighter.

Burt, a brindle-colored whippet, went missing from his owner in August in Morningside Heights. 

A Fire Department of New York firefighter spotted Burt in the last three weeks near the FDNY training facility on Randall's Island and nicknamed the one-year-old dog, which he thought was a scraggly-looking greyhound, 'The Rock'.

FDNY firefighter David Kelly became worried about Burt because of the approaching snowstorm and decided to set a trap for him, even though previous efforts to catch him had failed.

Kelly said: 'Every time I'd go up to him, he'd run off.'

The firefighter, who had been putting out canned dog cuisine for Burt in the same spot every night, set a trap by placing food in a cage and attaching a rope to the door.

His first attempt to catch Burt was a failure but Kelly was able to secure the skinny puppy in the cage on his second try.

'It was pretty tricky,' Kelly told the New York Post. 

'I was going to let him eat a while, in case it didn't work, so he could at least get some food in him.'

After scanning the web for pictures of missing whippets, Kelly came across the Facebook page titled 'Bring Burt Home'.

He did just that after reaching out to owner Lauren Piccolo.

Kelly said: 'As soon as he saw his owner, the dog started wagging his tail, licking her.' 

Burt is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery thanks to the efforts of Kelly

After Burt went missing in August, his owner made posters and created the 'Bring Burt Home' Facebook page

Piccolo thanked the FDNY and Kelly for bringing her 'devilishly handsome' and 'bashful' dog back to her.

'I am tremendously grateful for the efforts of the FDNY to recover Burt,' she said in a statement released by the department. 

'While Burt is a resilient dog, I don't think he would have survived such a fierce storm.

'The FDNY's efforts were incredible and timely.'

Burt is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery. 

Kelly said: 'They were very excited to have their dog back and the dog was even more excited. 

'I don't like to see an animal or person suffering, so I was just glad to help.'
