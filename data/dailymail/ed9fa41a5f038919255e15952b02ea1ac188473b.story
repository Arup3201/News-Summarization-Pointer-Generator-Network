Help: Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint, pictured, employs her husband, Phil Cole

MPs have been accused of using their families to earn extra money from taxpayers after it was revealed more than a quarter now employ relatives.

The bill for family members on the public payroll has risen by 50 per cent since the general election to reach almost £3.8million.

Cabinet Ministers and senior Labour MPs are among the 167 MPs who now have wives, children or even parents on the public payroll.

The relatives enjoy salaries as high as £49,999 for office duties, with several benefiting from generous pay rises in the past four years.

Among senior Tories enjoying the perk of employing relatives are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

In the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal, Parliament’s standards watchdog called for a ban on politicians hiring loved ones to work in their constituency offices or in the Commons.

But MPs attacked the ‘incendiary’ plan and when the new expenses regime was introduced in 2010, MPs were allowed to hire one relative, with the details declared on a register.

New figures reveal a sharp increase in the practice. In 2010 there were 137 MPs employing family members but the figure soared to 167 last year.

The total pay bill has rocketed from £2.4million in 2010-11 to almost £3.8million in 2013-14.

It means that the average salary paid to family members has risen by a third, from just over £17,101 to just over £22,400.

MPs who have given their relatives payrises include Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Dugher, whose wife Joanna earns up to £34,999 after moving up three pay bands when she became his office manager.

His Tory counterpart, Mr McLoughlin, employs wife Lynn works as a senior parliamentary assistant and she has moved up a band to earn up to £44,999.

Ipsa, which took over responsibility for MPs’ expenses and allowances, gives staff salaries in £5,000 bands.

Veteran left-wing Labour MP Dennis Skinner raised the pay of his partner Lois Blasenheim, who is his senior parliamentary assistant, to up to £39,999.

Tory Christopher Chope’s wife is in the top pay bracket, receiving between £45,000 and £49,999 a year for working as his office manager. She has moved up one band.

Labour frontbencher Hilary Benn pays his wife Sally up to £24,999. Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint employs her husband Phil Cole as her senior parliamentary assistant on a salary of up to £39,999.

Mr Fallon pays his wife Wendy up to £19,999 and Mr Grayling’s wife Susan earns up to £39,999.

Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb’s wife Beatrice is on up to £19,999, while the wife of Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude receives up to £14,999.

Nadine Dorries employs daughter Jennifer as her senior parliamentary assistant on up to £34,999. She previously employed another daughter, Philippa, on up to £44,999.

MPs are still allowed to employ more than one family member if they did so before the new rules were introduced.

The only MP to do so is Tory Laurence Robertson whose partner Anne Marie Adams earns up to £44,999 as his senior parliamentary assistant, while his estranged wife Susan can earn up to £29,999.

The public outcry over MPs employing family members began in 2008, when Tory MP Derek Conway was accused of paying his two sons for nonexistent jobs.

Calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later.

Ipsa said: ‘We have introduced a number of restrictions and safeguards to regulate MPs employing family members or other connected parties.

‘And, crucially, we think the public should know about these arrangements — which is why we publish all the details including the name, job title and salary range of all connected parties employed by MPs.’
