Bernie Ecclestone has very particular requirements for Formula One's pre-race grid walk.

Being a glamorous woman is top of his list.

In a letter that has come to light, Ecclestone wrote to former Caterham team principal Cyril Abiteboul requesting:

Bernie Ecclestone appears to have written a letter outlining his requirements for the grid

The Formula One chief made a point of calling for glamorous ladies to be given passes

'Please be reminded that where possible, grid access passes should be used for celebrities or people of note or as always, really glamorous ladies.

'This is not so much a sporting matter but a part of the show business of Formula One.'

The letter, from May 2013, is signed 'Bernie' and appears to be genuine. 

Sportsmail contacted Ecclestone's office for confirmation but they declined to comment.

Ecclestone's blueprint is hardly surprising, the grid walk being unashamedly about glitz and glamour.
