Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston will be suspended for half of Saturday's game against Clemson after yelling obscenities in the center of campus.

At 20, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback's athletic displays have lit up crowds at FSU, but this latest spectacle follows a string of questionable behavior off the field.

Winston's alleged crimes run from the absurd, such as shoplifting crab and stealing soda in ketchup cups, to the horrific, as Winston was accused of raping a student in 2012.

Suspended: Heisman Trophy-winner Jameis Winston was suspended for half a game for shouting obscenities in the center of FSU campus Tuesday

On Tuesday, students at FSU started tweeting that they had seen Winston in the middle of campus shouting, 'f*** her right in the p****.' 

The phrase comes from a series of videos staged to look newscasts that went viral earlier in the year.

On Wednesday FSU's athletic director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garrett Stokes issued a statement saying Winston 'will be withheld from competition for the first half of the Clemson game.'

Winston called his outburst a 'selfish act' in his regularly scheduled press conference after news of the suspension broke.

 Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act.

The New York Times reported in the wake of the alleged sexual assault at Florida State that there was 'virtually no investigation at all.'

Police waited almost a year to interview a witness and gather DNA evidence from the accused, finally declining to prosecute Winston. A Title IX investigation was later launched against FSU.

In 2013, cops were called to a Tallahassee Burger King after an assistant manager says she saw Winston stealing soda in ketchup cups. No charges were pressed at the time.

The next year, Winston was caught on camera walking out of a Publix supermarket with $32.72 worth of crab legs and crawfish without paying. 

According to Tomahawk Nation Winston received a citation and his punishment was community service and a temporary suspension from the baseball team, where he plays outfield.
