A top grammar school that was fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event had to call another ambulance to the premises after a boy ran into a wall, during a 100m sprint.

Governors of the Judd School in Tonbridge, Kent, admitted failing to ensure the safety of a 14 year-old boy who nearly died from head injuries after being hit with a metal shot. 

But less than a week after the case was heard by magistrates, paramedics returned to the school when a 12 year-old pupil reportedly ran into a wall following a 100 metre sprint.

The Judd School was fined £10,000 last week after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event when too many sports were going on at the same time. Last week the school had to call an ambulance after another pupil is believed to have been injured after running into a wall during a 100m sprint event 

The year eight pupil had to be treated at the scene and then taken to hospital after being injured after he ran into a wall at the prestigious school at about 1pm last Friday, headmaster Robert Masters confirmed. 

The boy suffered a bang to his forehead and was taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, a South East Coast Ambulance spokesman said. He is no longer in hospital.

Days earlier Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court heard the school failed to follow its own safety guidelines during a PE lesson last June where a pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull during a shot put event.

Pupils were taking part in six field sports on June 20 last year.

The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put.

But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time.

After he was injured the year nine pupil was rushed to King's College Hospital in London for emergency brain surgery because parts of his skull had gone into his brain, causing swelling.

He was in hospital for almost a month.  

A pupil was hit on the head by a shot during an athletics session on the shot put field (pictured) last year 

Magistrates heard the boy had returned to the school but will have to live with 'the consequences' of the incident for the rest of his life.

He was formerly a keen rugby player but has been told he will never play again.

The school was charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil and pleaded guilty. 

Magistrates said the safety breach was 'substantial' and ordered the the school to pay £10,000 in fines and £1,375 in costs.

The court heard that the boy had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle.

The Judd School was fined £10,000 over the incident involving the shot put, after magistrates ruled they had breached their general duty to the pupil 

He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit him on the head. 

Following the incident the school said it had suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place.

Speaking after the ruling head teacher Robert Masters said they expressed 'deepest regret' over the incident. 

He previously said: 'We have re-examined all our safety procedures in PE and are in the process of doing the same across the whole school. We have also shared the lessons from this incident with other secondary schools.

'Whilst accepting that we cannot eliminate accidents altogether, we are as confident as we can be that a similar accident will not happen again in future.'

The Judd School, which is heavily oversubscribed, has more than 1,000 pupils aged 11-18 and has won numerous national sports competitions in athletics and cross country.

Headmaster Robert Masters declined to comment on the latest incident.
