Jason Kenny can appreciate the romance of winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, at a velodrome bearing the name of his friend Sir Chris Hoy, the greatest track cyclist Britain has produced and the man he has long been tipped to succeed.

But, pleasant as a Commonwealth gold medal hanging round his neck might feel, Kenny knows it will not put food on the table or heat the house he shares with girlfriend and fellow cyclist Laura Trott.

‘We like to race for all the romantic reasons - to be Commonwealth champion - but we’re also racing to pay the bills and the bills just aren’t really paid at the Commonwealth Games,’ said Kenny.

‘A lot of members of the public 
probably see the Commonwealths as second only to the Olympics. But when 
you’re actually involved in the sport it doesn’t seem that way. It gets 
devalued a bit. It’s a real grey area, but for us it doesn’t fit into 
any kind of category.’

It
 is an admirably honest assessment of an event that critics see as 
antiquated and irrelevant from a sporting perspective. But Kenny’s views
 will come as a blow to Commonwealth Games organisers as they try to 
lure the biggest stars to Scotland this summer. Even more worrying is 
the fact they appear to be shared by Trott, another of Britain’s 
most-loved athletes.

‘A lot 
of people don’t even take it seriously,’ she told Sportsmail, ‘It’s the 
same with a lot of countries. I went to Delhi (Commonwealth Games) as a 
youngster (in 2010) and there was barely anyone there. It’s not the same
 as a World Championships and it’s certainly not the same as an Olympic 
Games.’

Both Kenny and 
Trott recognise the financial benefits of winning gold at the Olympics. 
They took home two each at London 2012, a glorious fortnight that 
concluded with their very public ‘outing’ as a couple, when a picture 
emerged of them kissing while watching the beach volleyball sat behind 
David Beckham and next to Prince Harry. Their success helped draw in 
sponsorship and advertising deals.

‘It’s
 the only time you get that kind of exposure,’ said Kenny, ‘For other 
sports they get lots of exposure between the four years but for us, 
every four years track cycling comes to the forefront and it’s important
 for us to put on a big show.’

They
 are back at the Lee Valley Velopark almost two years on, in their role 
as ambassadors for Disney Aim High 2014 mentorship programme, training 
up the next generation of budding cyclists. Although they don’t talk 
about their relationship in public, they have a natural rapport, batting
 ideas off each other.

The 
pair are not overly concerned about the British team’s performance at 
the World Track Championships in Cali in March where their five medal 
haul fell two short of Head Coach Shane Sutton’s target.

‘British
 Cycling put a lot of emphasis on the Olympics so if we didn’t win 
another gold medal until the Games in Rio, they’d prefer it than for us 
to win four gold medals and then lose at the Games,’ said Trott, who won
 silver in the omnium at the World Championships.

‘We
 peak for the Olympics, we get all the equipment and everything thrown 
at us for the Olympics whereas for the World Championships we don’t get 
all that. So you’re definitely going to see dips in performance.’ The 
men came home without any medals but Kenny, 26, is fierce in his belief 
that gender is irrelevant in British Cycling’s success.

‘Medals
 are medals no matter who wins them and what sex they are,’ said Kenny, 
‘If you want equality, which I’m assuming most women do, then you can’t 
say, “We won all the gold medals” when you do. Laura’s gold medals are 
worth just as much as mine. I think sport’s a good equaliser in that 
sense.’

Partners: Trott and Kenny live together and regularly train together

Trott, 22, came
 55th in the inaugural Women’s Tour earlier this month, a professional 
women’s road race on an unprecedented scale in Britain.

She
 said: ‘I think it’s a great step. It’s quite smart to say we don’t want
 it to run alongside the men’s race. I think women’s road race will 
continue to grow. It’s slowly getting bigger and it’s nice that GB is 
leading the way.’

Trott
 also endorses La Course by Le Tour, a one-day stage at the finish of 
the Tour de France for women road racers but stops short of getting 
behind the petition by Olympic teammate Emma Pooley and Dutch Olympic 
road race champion Marianne Vos for a women’s Tour de France.

She
 says: ‘I’m not so swayed on the whole Tour de France idea. They do have
 a stage race (La Course) but some women don’t agree with it because it 
doesn’t go up the classic hills. But I just don’t think it should run 
along the same course as the men’s because we would never, ever complete
 300km. You’d get two riders rolling in after 10 hours.'

‘There’d be deaths,’ Kenny predicts.

‘I
 just don’t think it would be realistic,’ adds Trott, ‘We ride a tour 
for five days and at the end of it we’re completely knackered. For three
 weeks - no chance. I certainly wouldn’t finish, put it that way.’

As
 for the young girls Trott has been mentoring, she insists there are far
 more positive female role models to inspire them than there were a 
decade ago.

‘At the Olympics
 there was a lot of female medal winners so they have a lot of women to 
look up to,’ said Trott, ‘Ten years ago, there weren’t as many. For me 
personally, when I was a child, I could play with what I wanted.

'If
 I wanted to play with an action man, my parents would go buy me an 
action man. It wasn’t stereotyped like that in our family. I guess sport
 in itself has always been a male-dominated thing so it is a little more
 equal now that there are more role models.

‘If a lady wants to go in the kitchen then she can but if she wants to go on a dirt bike then she can do that too.’

Laura Trott and Jason Kenny are training up the next generation of budding 
cyclists as part of the Disney Aim High mentorship initiative. Four 
children from across the UK were given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity 
to train with Britain’s best at the London Olympic VeloPark. The unique 
experience will be shown on Disney Channel, Disney XD and 
www.disney.co.uk/aimhigh from May 26.
