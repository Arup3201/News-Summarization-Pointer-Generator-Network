A husband-to-be has spoken for the first time of the moment his beloved fiancée was shot dead - as she chatted to him on the phone.

Rod Hernandez, 58, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was just weeks away from tying the knot with Tanya Nikitina in 2010 when she was gunned down by her former mother-in-law.

Tanya, 34, who's real name is Tetyana, was talking to Rod while sitting in the school car park where she worked as a teacher when her life was horrifically cut short. 

Tragic end: Rod Hernandez, right, had been due to marry Tanya Nikitina, left, but just weeks before their big day, she was shot dead her her former mother-in-law

Jailed: Mary was sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years after pleading guilty to murder

She was shot by Mary Nance Hanson because the 71-year-old believed her son Dale Jankowski - Tanya's ex-husband - should have custody of the couple's two children. 

Rod heard the attack as he spoke to Tanya on the phone and said his fiancée's dying moments will haunt him forever.

He recalled: 'She was telling me how much she loved me when suddenly I heard her scream and there was a loud bang. 

'I could still hear her engine revving and the radio playing. I thought she'd had an accident.

'The school was only a short drive away, so I jumped in my car. I stayed on the phone the whole way there, screaming her name trying to wake her up.'

On arriving at the school in Salt Lake, Rod was shocked to discover Tanya has been killed by her former mother-in-law. 

Murderer: Mary Nance Hanson, 71, left, gunned down her former daughter-in-law over the custody of her grandchildren after Tanya, pictured right, and her son Dale, divorced

After being arrested, Mary pleaded guilty to first degree murder.

Rod said: 'I couldn't get my head around it. Why on earth would Mary want to kill Tanya? She'd done nothing wrong. Now the children are left without a mother and I've lost my beloved fiancée. 

'She was the woman of my dreams.'

Rod had met Tanya in 2008, three years after her divorce from Dale.

He said her relationship with her ex-husband and his family was often under strain due to child care arrangements for Stefan, then seven, and Sasha, five. 

Rod said: 'Dale lived with his mother, and the kids would go and stay with them at weekends. But there was some tension between Tanya and Dale and Mary.' 

He added that Tanya began receiving threatening text messages from her former mother-in-law, claiming she didn't deserve to have custody of the two children.

'I hated seeing Tanya upset, so I asked her if she wanted to bring the wedding forward, to give her something to look forward to,' he said.

Haunted: Rod recalls of his fiancee's last moments 'she was telling me how much she loved me when suddenly I heard her scream and there was a loud bang'

The couple planned to tie the knot in a Las Vegas ceremony in February 2010. But on January 29, two weeks before the big day, Tanya was brutally executed.

Mary had hidden in the car park armed with a 38-caliber revolver waiting for Tanya to leave school and get into her car.

She first fired through the window, then reloaded the gun, opened the car door and fired again. A medical examiner would later confirm the cause of death as four gunshot wounds to the head 

Mary showed little remorse when she appeared to be sentenced for the crime in August 2010 but did ask the judge if she could to receive a death sentence.

When he explained it didn't meet all the criteria to be considered a death penalty case, the grandmother replied: 'Well, I guess I didn't do a good enough job then.' 

'It was such a twisted thing to say,' Rod said. 

'Woman of my dreams': Rod pictured with Tanya, said he can't believe the love of his life has been taken away

Wedding bells: The couple had been due to marry in Vegas 

Loss: Tanya had two children with her first husband, Dale, who will now grow up without their mother

Mary was sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years. 

But Rod said the punishment gave him little comfort.

'No amount of time in prison is going to bring Tanya back. Hearing my fiancée's tragic end on the phone, still haunts me,' he said. 

'I still can't believe she's gone. She was my world and Mary stole everything from me when she killed her.'

He added that Mary's time behind bars seems to have given her time to reflect on her crime but he will never be able to forgive and forget.

'Mary wrote to me from prison saying she'd done it to make all of our lives better. She wanted my forgiveness but what she did is unforgivable. She stole an innocent life. 

'She really was the mother-in-law from hell,' he said.
