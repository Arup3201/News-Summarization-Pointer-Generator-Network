Dani Alves was booed by Villarreal fans on his first return to the Estadio El Madrigal - where he caused an international incident by eating a banana thrown from the stands last season.

In April, the Brazilian defender responded to fans' attempts to taunt him by picking up the offending fruit and taking a bite midway through taking a corner during Barcelona's 3-2 victory.

Despite the shameful jeering from Villarreal fans on Alves' return, Barcelona once again had the last laugh on Sunday when teenager Sandro poked home a cross from Lionel Messi to score the only goal in a 1-0 victory.

Alves' actions last season provoked reactions from all over the world with several players, including Brazil teammate Neymar, posting pictures of themselves eating bananas accompanied by anti-racism comments.

Alves has often been subjected to racist taunts and called fighting racism 'a lost war' in January 2013, after segments of Real Madrid's fans abused him with monkey chants during a match. 

However, after the game in question the 30-year-old only quipped: 'I don't know who threw the banana but I want to thank him. It gave me the energy to put two more crosses in for our goals.'
