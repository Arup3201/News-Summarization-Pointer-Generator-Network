A convicted rioter accused of murdering PC Keith Blakelock during the 1985 Tottenham riots wrote a chilling rap song bragging of 'chopping him all over', a court heard yesterday.

Nicholas Jacobs wrote how the policeman 'begged for mercy' as a mob hacked him to death, it was said.

The lyrics tell how rioters surrounded PC Blakelock and laughed when the constable started to 'scream and holla'.

Nicholas Jacobs, 45, from Hackney, east London, is on trial at the Old Bailey for the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock, 40, who was hacked to death during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985

The 40-year-old officer was stabbed 43
 times by a baying mob shouting 'kill the pig' as he tried to protect 
firemen. There were also shouts of 'kill the beastie' and 'get his 
f****** head on a pole'.

A knife was embedded in the PC's neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him.

Using
 slang, Jacobs, who was 16 at the time, allegedly wrote: 'We chopper, we
 start to chop him on his hand, we chop him on him finger, we chop him 
on him leg, we chop him on him shoulder, him head, him chest, him neck, 
we chop him all over.

'When we done kill him off lord we feel so much better.'

He tells how he wiped his knife before checking on his daughter and chatting with his girlfriend over dinner, the court heard.

Jacobs
 allegedly wrote how he had gone to the Broadwater Farm housing estate 
in Tottenham, North London, with a gang on October 6 to kill a police 
officer.

He describes how PC Blakelock was an 'unlucky f*****' who 'never smell the danger'.

Jacobs,
 45, allegedly wrote the song while he was in a young offenders' 
institution in 1988 where he was serving a sentence for affray at the 
riots. It was found in his cell.

Extracts were read to the Old Bailey yesterday.

During
 another prison term in 1992, Jacobs told a fellow inmate he had taken 
part in the attack and had 'got two good stabs in', the jury heard.

And
 when he was arrested again in May 2000, he allegedly told a police 
officer: 'F*** off, I was one of them who killed PC Blakelock.'

Three men who were at the riots are expected claim in court that they saw Jacobs stabbing the policeman.

One,
 known as Witness Q, told police: 'They tried to cut the copper's head 
off. Jacobs was one of them.'

Describing the attack, he said PC 
Blakelock fell, adding: 'He was surrounded and being butchered in 
seconds. It was savage.

'People
 were tooled up with machetes, knives and iron bars. There were so many,
 they could not get at him. All I could see was the officer's feet. His 
feet twitched then went motionless.'

Witness
 Q said Jacobs was armed with 'what looked like a mini sword' and used 
it to stab PC Blakelock 'a minimum of five or six times'.

Another
 witness, who will give evidence under the pseudonym John Brown, told 
police Jacobs was a 'nutter' who was 'out to get blood' that night, the 
court heard. he said Jacobs had a curved machete with a 12in blade 
'which he lunged into the area of PC Blakelock's shoulders'.

The
 third witness, who will give evidence under the name Rhodes Levin, told
 police Jacobs had a 'knife in his right hand' and he 'saw him stab the 
officer twice'.

Jacobs, of Hackney, East London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
