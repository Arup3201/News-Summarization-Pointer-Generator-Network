A landlady collapsed and died as she tried to break up a brawl in her pub on Christmas Eve.

Tributes have since poured in for Josephine Murtagh following her sudden death at the White Horse in Liskeard, Cornwall.

Officers said the landlady was not 
attacked but most likely suffered some form of 'medical episode' when 
trying to stop the fight.

Bouquets of flowers lay at the entrance to the pub as regulars customers friends came to pay tribute to the 59-year-old, who they described as 'like a mother' to them.

Regulars at the White Horse have paid tribute to landlady Josephine Murtagh after she died on Christmas Eve

A note fixed to the pub read: 'June, 
you are on a different planet now - our condolences because you were 
such a lovely person. Godspeed.'

A White Horse customer, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is a very close community here, the regulars all know each other and so this news has come as a huge shock to everyone.

'Nobody can quite believe what has happened. June was an amazing lady, it is just so sad that she’s gone.'

Police have now launched an investigation after what they described as 'a scrap' involving up to eight people, at around 10pm on Saturday.

It is believed Ms Murtagh was upstairs at the pub when she heard an altercation in the bar and came to try and sort it out.

Emergency services were called but Ms Murtagh was pronounced dead at the scene.

One former staff member said: 'She was like a mother to me, I'm more than happy and proud to say that.

'She was a wonderful person and had been through a lot - she was always smiling and helped people whenever she could.

'It didn't matter to her what your background was, where you came from, who you were.

'I took my young daughter in to see her just last week - she was just such a lovely, warm person.'

Ms Murtagh was popular with locals in the pub in Liskeard, Cornwall

Three men, two aged 18 and one 20-year-old, were arrested on suspicion of affray and taken into custody at Launceston Police Station.

They were released on bail until March, police confirmed.

The pub was closed on Boxing Day.

Inspector Gareth Twigg said: 'There are a lot of witnesses to speak to and a lot of statements to take, and then a file will be passed to the coroner.

'Early investigations appear to show that there was a fight in the pub at around 10pm, when the woman tragically died.

'About six to eight people were involved, and because of the disturbance it looks as though she got involved to get them to stop it.

'It would appear that she then collapsed, although she didn’t appear to be attacked.'
