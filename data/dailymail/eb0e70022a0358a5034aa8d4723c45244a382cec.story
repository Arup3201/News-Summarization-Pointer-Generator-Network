A convicted Russian mobster and informant facing a murder charge in the shooting death of a young rapper has accused his FBI handler of taking gifts and cash from him.

Among the gifts reportedly provided by ex-gangster Mani Chulpayev were jewelry, cars, lavish hotel stays, sports tickets and cash - among other items.

Chulpayev was arrested last month in connection to the death of young rapper Melvin Vernell III - known as Lil Phat - in Sandy Springs, Georgia last year.

Informant: Former Russian gangster Mani Chulpayev has accused his FBI handler of accepting gifts from him that included jewelry, cars, sports tickets and cash

Victim: Chulpayev was arrested last month in connection to the murder of young rapper Melvin Vernell III - known as Lil Phat - in Sandy Springs, Atlanta last year

Chulpayev's lawyer, George Plumides, says that his client was betrayed by those who were supposed to be protecting him, and it may have steered authorities in Georgia to bring murder charges against his client.

Plumides told ABC News: 'The agent obstructed a murder investigation. That's my opinion and it is Mani's as well.'

Plumides added: 'It's nice to have an FBI agent that is looking over your shoulder, I guess. But I think he was ill-served. He didn't get a bargain.'Â 

The FBI confirmed to ABC News that its 
inspection division, as well as the Department of Justice, are looking 
into the allegations against the agent, Dante Jackson.

Accomplice? Also arrested in the murder of Lil Phat was San Francisco basketball star Decensae White. He was taken into custody earlier this month and extradited to Georgia

A bureau spokesman told the network: 'We take the allegations very seriously. The policy on this could not be more clear.'

Plumides claims that even when 
Chulpayev was under investigation in the murder, Jackson had asked him 
for $3,500 and various gifts.

Speaking to WSBTV, District Attorney Paul Howard said that his office was looking into Chulpayev as a possible suspect shortly after the murder, but he would not say whether that was because the FBI interfered.

'Maybe sometime after we get this murder [investigation] completed then we'll look at some of the people that are involved in this incident, like the FBI participation,' Howard told the station.

Lil Phat was killed in June 2012 in a parking deck next to the Northside Hospital Women's Center. Two men were seen leaving the seen after Lil Phat was shot.

Also arrested in the murder was San Francisco basketball star Decensae White.

He was taken into custody earlier this month and has been extradited to Georgia.

Reports said that Lil Phat was at the hospital because his child was about to be born.

The 19-year-old, known for being featured in rapper Webbie's popular 2007 song, 'Independent.'

The song, which praised a woman's independent nature, peaked at No. 9 on Billboard's 100 and topped the rap chart.

Lil Phat, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana native, was on the record label Trill Entertainment.
