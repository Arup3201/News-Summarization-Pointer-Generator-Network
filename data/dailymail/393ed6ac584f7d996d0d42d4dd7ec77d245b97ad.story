We're all in this together - but not if you're an American.

A new study by psychologists at Stanford University has found that Americans aren't driven by a sense of community.

And calls to Americans to act interdependently, rather than independently, could even make things worse.

So if you're trying to get people to do something like recycling, it's better to stress that it's good for them individually rather than pointing out the wider benefits.

President Obama urged Americans to work together in his inauguration address - but he might have done better stressing the maverick quality of his fellow citizens, according to the Stanford researchers

All in it together? White American students were less motivated when prompted to think about interdependence, the researchers found

'American culture stresses independence, and the desire for independence fuels behaviour,' says MarYam Hamedani, one of the study's authors.

'People often like the idea of 
working together and certainly care about social issues. But our 
findings show that thinking about and caring about others doesn't always
translate into effective action.'

President Barack Obama urged his fellow citizens to think more about the wider community at his second inauguration last month.

Being selfish really does make us happier, researchers have found - so long as we can avoid feeling guilty.

Although we are taught the benefits of kindness and altruism, it seems we are happiest when simply told to pursue our own self-interest.

Researchers found the key to contentment is feeling we have no choice but to be selfish.

In contrast, the study, carried out by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, found that those who actively choose a selfish path usually have to battle with guilt.

They speculated that because we’re taught as children that ‘sharing means caring’, if we make a decision out of self-interest over others.

But that frequently means we forego the things we know will make us happy.

Psychological scientists Jonathan Berman and Deborah Small of the 
University of Pennsylvania carried out tests to see when people feel 
happiest.

In one they recruited 216 undergraduates and gave them each 3 dollars.

Some were told to donate it to the charity UNICEF, some were told to 
keep the money and some participants were told that they could choose 
what to do with it.

Those students told to keep the money for themselves reported being far 
happier with the outcome than those who were told to donate the money 
and those who were free to choose.

Mr Berman said: 'Often what people really want to do is act in a selfish manner.

'But they don’t do that, because they know they would feel selfish if they did.'

The research is published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

In his speech, he said: 'The American people can no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone.'

But Obama might have been better to appeal to the independently minded Americans as mavericks.

The Stanford researchers carried out three challenges to test the participants' motivation. In the first experiment, participants – all Stanford students – were given difficult word puzzles to solve.

In the second, they were given a physical challenge to see how long they would stick at it. During both tasks, participants were primed to think either about independence or about interdependence.

After the initial priming, the researchers found that white American participants were less motivated to persist at these challenging tasks when they were encouraged to think of the broader good, or interdependence.

When working together, the students were less persistent in solving difficult puzzles and applied less physical pressure in a test of their strength.

In the third experiment, designed to test these motivational effects in relation to a pressing social issue, students were asked to give their opinions about a class on promoting environmental sustainability after viewing a website about the course.

When the course description emphasised working together, being adaptive and taking others' views into account, white American students predicted they would put less effort into the course.

They said they were less likely to agree that taking the course should be a university requirement than when the course description emphasised taking charge, being unique and knowing your own perspective.

However, the motivation of Asian-American students did not change across the three tasks.

The researchers noted that Asian-American students are exposed to both mainstream American culture, which stresses independence, and East Asian culture, which stresses the value and importance of interdependence.

As a result, appeals to think and act interdependently or independently were equally motivating.

'Currently, if we want to inspire Americans to think and act interdependently, it may work best to actually emphasize their independence to motivate them to do so,' Hamedani said. 'Tell them, "Be the change you want to see in the world" instead of "We're all in this together".'
