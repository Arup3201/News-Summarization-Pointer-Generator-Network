Just one month after raising eyebrows by kissing in public, Smash star Katharine McPhee and her director Michael Morris - who are married to other people - are already on a break, according to People.

'Katharine is no longer seeing Michael - at least for now,' a source tells the weekly.

Katharine, 29, has been separated from Nick Cokas, her husband of four years, for seven months and their relationship reportedly remains 'in limbo.' The status of Michael's marriage to actress Mary McCormack, 44, with whom he has three children, is not known.

Katharine's and Mary's representatives did not return calls to MailOnline.

'Katharine still has no plans to move forward with divorce at the moment, though they are not living together,' adds People's source.

The brunette beauty has looked to be in OK spirits lately. On November 2 she appeared upbeat in jeans and a black top as she headed out for errands and on November 5 the LA native showed off some leg in playful, come-hither over-the-knee boots.

But People's insider insists, 'This is an incredibly hard time for Katharine.'

Smash fans were shocked to see photos of Katharine passionately kissing Michael on October 22.

The the former American Idol finalist looked madly in love with the handsome director as she made out with him by a car. Prior to the PDA, few, if any, people were aware the two were linked in any other way than professionally.

The two had worked together on NBC's musical series Smash which is now canceled.

People reports that Mary, who was on the hit show Plain Sight, 'prefers to keep her focus on her daughters' Lillian, aged two, Rose, aged six and Margaret, aged nine.

'Mary is a strong woman,' another source tells People. 'Her dedication to her children will remain her focus and gift.'

In late October Mary and Michael were spotted looking downcast as they left an LA office building side by side, but not showing any signs of affection.

Mary had reportedly kicked Michael out of their home after she saw the smooching photos.

Katharine, who reportedly was 'very upset' about the kissing photos getting out and 'didn't mean for anyone to be hurt,' doesn't seem to have landed any new projects lately.

In May Deadline said she would star in the thriller Depravity but no start date has been listed.

Last month Jamie Krauss - PR Director at the Narrative Group - told FOX411, 'This probably won’t affect Katharine’s sales or her ability to get roles in the near future but her likability factor will be seriously tarnished.

'When female stars act as home wreckers, the American public, but particularly women, tend to sour to them very fast. Look at Kristen Stewart or LeAnn Rimes or even Angelina Jolie. All of them took a lot of heat for their famous affairs,' added the publicist.
