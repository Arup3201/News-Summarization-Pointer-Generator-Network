A mother has defied the odds to have a baby after refusing to let doctors remove her last ovary.

Sarah Muukua was told she had a cyst the size of an orange on the ovary but refused to let doctors remove it because she wanted a baby.

The cafe owner was even warned by medics that the cyst could rupture, causing her to die of blood poisoning.

Sarah Muukua, 31, risked her life to have baby Michael who was born in March 2013

Despite the dangers, she refused to go ahead with the operation.

As she had already had her right ovary removed three years earlier, she did not want to give up her last chance of having a baby.

The life-risking decision paid off as Mrs Muukua became pregnant with son Michael weeks later while she was received counselling to help persuade her to go through with the operation.

Mrs Muukua, 31, said: ‘I never thought I would conceive, let alone experience childbirth. Michael is our little miracle.

‘He is amazing. He is such a good little baby, unbelievably good and happy.

‘At the time, all the odds were against him being here but he still he made into the world.

Mrs Muukua had an ovarian cyst the size of an orange but she refused to have it removed as surgeons warned her they might have to remove her only remaining ovary - meaning she couldn't have had baby Michael

Surgeons warned Mrs Muukua (pictured with Michael and husband Clemens) that the cyst could rupture putting her at risk of potentially life-threatening blood poisoning

‘When they removed my left ovary in November 2010 it damaged my nerves in my stomach and left me with chronic pain.

‘Two years ago the pain got even worse and the doctor sent me for a scan - it showed a cyst on my left side the size of a small orange.

‘They told me they needed to remove it straight away and they gave me a consent form to sign.

‘One of the possibilities on the consent form was to remove my left ovary if they couldn’t save it.

‘I just couldn’t bring myself to sign it as it was giving up my last hope of children.

Surgeons tried to persuade Mrs Muukua to have the surgery but just weeks later she discovered she was pregnant with baby Michael (pictured shortly after his birth)

Mrs Muukua was so convinced she wouldn't be able to have a baby that she started looking into adoption

‘I was in floods of tears as three different consultants and the head of gynaecology all tried to talk to me about the consequences.

‘They said if cysts rupture it can give you blood poisoning and that I was in danger of it exploding.’

Mrs Muukua and her husband Clemens, 33, had been trying for a baby for 10 years but struggled to conceive after she was plagued with ovarian cysts, fluid filled sacs which develop in a woman’s ovary.

Mrs Muukua, who is a trained counsellor, talked to her family about the idea of adopting and fostering and had come to terms with never having children of her own.

She added: ‘I had just got my head around it and then all of a sudden it was all turned upside down.

Mrs Muukua said: 'I never thought I would conceive let alone experience childbirth. Michael is our little miracle. He is amazing. He is such a good little baby, unbelievably good and happy'

‘I started going off coffee, which I absolutely love, so I took a pregnancy test and realised I was pregnant.

‘When it showed positive I was absolutely shocked, me and Clemens were so surprised, it was on July 2.

‘I had next to zero hormones, one ovary, internal scar tissue, damage to my bowel and bladder and still managed to somehow fall pregnant. It was against all the odds.

‘The cyst had also dispersed so I no longer needed the operation.’

Mrs Muukua, from Cheltenham, had five scans during her pregnancy and numerous tests to make sure both she and her baby were fine, as well as having to have drugs to maintain her hormone levels.

Michael was born on March 8 2013 weighing 7lb 10oz at Gloucester Royal Hospital.

The gamble paid off and she conceived Michael soon afterwards
