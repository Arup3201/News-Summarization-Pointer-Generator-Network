The teenage stowaway who miraculously survived the flight from California to Hawaii in the wheel well of a plane has spoken out for the first time about his death-defying journey.

Speaking to CBS San Francisco, 15-year-old Yahya Abdi, who is originally from Somalia, said he jumped aboard the jet in San Jose on April 20 because he was desperate to see his mother, who is living in Africa.

'I took that plane because it was the 
closest one I could find that was going to go west,' Abdi said.

As the plane took off, he crouched down, covered his ears and as they soared to 35,000 feet, nothing more than the outer shell of the plane protected him from a fatal plunge.

Speaking out: Yahya Abdi, the 15-year-old who hid in a plane's wheel well in April, said he was not scared throughout the five-and-a-half hour journey. He said he was simply desperate to see his mother

'It was above the clouds, I could see through the little holes,' he said.

Despite the harrowing journey, he insisted he was not scared and revealed he had planned the escape for a while because he was desperate to get away from his family's home in Santa Clara.

'I didn't want to 
live with my stepmom,' he explained. 'Second of all, I wanted to find my mom. I haven't 
seen her since I was young.'

He had not seen his mother, Ubah Mohammed Abdule, since he was seven and later learned that she was living in a refugee camp in Ethiopia. He still hasn't seen her - and said he would love for her to live in the U.S.

Miracle: He is circle leaving the wheel well on the tarmac of the airport in Maui, Hawaii earlier this year

Saved: He is pictured being taken for medical care but says he is well and has regained all of his hearing

Hiding place: He hid in this jet wheel well after finding the first plane that was heading west

It emerged last week that she has left the refugee camp because threats have been made against her life. She believes relatives of her former husband - Abdi's father - could be behind the calls.

Abdlrasak Abas Omar, a legal protection officer at the camp, said that Abdule showed camp administrators logs of anonymous calls she said were made by people threatening her with death.

She added to The Associated Press that the boy longed to see her, but couldn't because his father told him she was dead and didn't allow contact. She said his relatives are now out to get her.

'They are going to kill me, so that his claims that I was dead will turn out to be true,' she said.

Abdi was hospitalized in Hawaii for two weeks, then flown back to California where he was placed in custody of Santa Clara County Child Protective Services.

Missed: He has still not seen his mother Ubah Mohammed Abdule, who is pictured with two of her children outside her hut in the Shedder refugee camp in eastern Ethiopia in April

Yusuf had flown to Hawaii to get his son and said that he was 'excited to bring him back home to his family in California' - but the teenager remains in a temporary foster home.

He plans to move in with an aunt near Minneapolis and after summer, he will start his junior year at high school. After he graduates, he has plans to join the army.

He added that he is physically well and has regained his hearing.
