The final countdown: It's an all-German affair between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley

Man in the middle: Poll took charge of the UEFA Cup final in 2005

MailOnline Sport's series of Football Friday Google+ Hangouts continues with former Barclays Premier League and international referee Graham Poll ahead of the Champions League final.

It's an all-German affair between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund as the Bundesliga giants do battle for Europe's showpiece silverware at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night.

No English teams came close to getting into the final, there wasn't even a Premier League representative in the last eight.

So what has happened to the game in this country? Have the standards dropped, or are we witnessing the berth of an era of German dominance of football in Europe?

Can new Manchester United boss David Moyes lead the three-times winners to the final or could Jose Mourinho take the Blues all the way in Europe in 2013-14?

Join the debate, join our Hangout today LIVE in Wembley from 12.30pm...

Graham Poll officiated the UEFA Cup 
final in 2005 and has been involved in two World Cups in 2002 and 2006 -
he knows what it takes to handle matches on the biggest stage.

And
the former referee had a tumultuous relationship with the Portuguese 
boss - what does he think will happen when the self-styled Special One finally 
returns to England?

Mourinho is free to return to 
Chelsea after Real Madrid president Florentino Perez waived 
the £12million compensation clause in his contract.

Perez
announced that Mourinho’s troubled and chaotic three-year stint at the 
Bernabeu will end next month after holding talks with the Portuguese 
coach over the weekend.

Mourinho
had four years left on his contract. He will take charge of Sunday’s 
clash at Real Sociedad and then bow out at home against Osasuna on June 
1.

The Portuguese will 
officially leave his position at the Bernabeu on June 3 and Chelsea are 
hoping to unveil him at a Stamford Bridge press conference the following
week.

Can he lead the Blues to another Premier League title?

How long will he last working under Roman Abramovich after the two fell out so spectacularly in 2007? Join the debate.
