A 32-year-old who spent £7,000 on sunbed sessions has been told he is dying of cancer because of his tanning addiction.

Damien Platt was so keen to look tanned he used sunbeds up to 200 times a year - four times more than the EU recommended safe usage.

Mr Platt would spend nine minutes in the tanning booths up to four times a week and continued this routine for eight years.

Damien Platt, 32, was diagnosed with terminal melanoma after eight years of frequent sunbed use

He says he used the sunbeds to make himself 'feel good'.

But his addiction has come at a huge price.

Doctors diagnosed him with melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, in 2010 after he spotted a mole on his thigh.

Then, last March, they gave him just 10 months to live after discovering the cancer was not curable.

Treatment has prolonged Mr Platt’s life but he now deeply regrets his years of sunbed use.

The ex-tradesman, from Little Hulton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I loved the confidence having a tan gave me and everyone would say how healthy I looked.

Mr Platt (pictured when he was using sunbeds) went for a tanning session up to four times a week

'I couldn't go anywhere unless I had been on the sunbeds first.

'Pretty much everyone in my life at that time used the sunbeds, so I thought I would give them a go.

'I just didn't feel normal without a tan and my confidence in the way I would look would go right down without them.

Symptoms that may indicate skin cancer include any mole, spot, lump or area of skin that:

'To find out I had melanoma was the worst feeling in the world.

'I felt completely numb and found it very hard to function properly for days, people would try talking to me but nothing would register.

'Now I'm just trying to be as happy as possible with the time I've got left.

'Doctors told me I had six to ten months to live last March but at the time they didn't have much feedback on the drugs I was taking.

'Thankfully the drugs have worked longer then they originally thought.

'However I'm still in the same position, the drugs will always stop working in every case - it is just a question of when.'

Mr Platt now wants to raise awareness of skin cancer and raise funds for Cancer Research UK.

He has support from Coronation Street star Simon Gregson, who plays landlord Steve McDonald, and he met soap star Michelle Keegan as a surprise treat from a friend.

The actor has invited him to Simon Gregson's Charity Ball at the Palace Hotel in Manchester on July 5 to warn people about the dangers of indoor and outdoor tanning.

He said: 'It's been horrific at times because I know how much it hurts my family to see me like this.'People are quite literally dying for a tan and it really isn't worth it.’

Mr Platt is now trying to raise awareness of the dangers of sunbeds as well as raising money for charity

Yinka Ebo, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Far from improving your looks, the UV radiation given off by sunbeds can make skin look wrinkled, leathery and old before it's time, and it also damages the DNA in your skin cells.

'Over time this damage can build up and may lead to skin cancer. If you're really desperate for a tan it's better to fake it.

'See your doctor if you notice any changes in the size, shape or colour of a mole or normal patch of skin.'

Mr Platt is using his Twitter @mymelanomafight and JustGiving page to reach a target of £10,000 and has so far raised more than £2,000.
