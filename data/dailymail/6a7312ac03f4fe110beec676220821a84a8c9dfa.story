The first ever example of a moon orbiting a planet outside our solar system may have been discovered 1,800 light years away.

And the body, called MOA-2011-BLG-262Lb, is even more unusual considering it appears to be drifting alone in the cosmos.

It is believed to consist of a 'rogue' planet - untethered to a star - around four times the mass of Jupiter and a moon about half the mass of Earth, substantially larger than our own lunar neighbour.

The body, called MOA-2011-BLG-262Lb, could be of a planet and the first ever moon detected outside our solar system

In a paper posted this week, David Bennett of the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and colleagues outline how they used an unusual method of detecting planetary bodies called gravitational microlensing.

'This is the first serious candidate from any survey that I am aware of,' astronomer David Kipping of Harvard University, who was not involved in the discovery, told New Scientist.

The researchers detected a large object passing in front of the star, followed by a smaller one.

However, the body could be a very small or failed star and its orbiting planet.

But if it is an exomoon, it is further 
interesting because it would be orbiting at around 12.5million miles 
from its planet. By comparison, Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, the 
largest in the solar system at two per cent the earth's mass, is about 
621,000 miles out.

Normally, exoplanets are detected by 
careful analysis in changes of the light coming from their star.

Gravitiational microlensing detects them when they pass in front of a 
distant star, as the object's gravity bends the light from the star, 
focusing it similar to the way a lens works.

Perhaps strangest of all, the moon and planet aren't near any other objects, and are definitely too far from the star that was used to detect them to orbit it.

This suggests they have been ejected from their original star system.

Astronomers have previously seen such rogue planets but they have never had accompanying moons.

'It almost begs the question as to whether we can really call these objects 'moons' or whether some other name is more apt,' adds Kipping.

The team says gravtitational microlensing is dependent on chance, but say the exciting data means humanity should be on the lookout for more.
