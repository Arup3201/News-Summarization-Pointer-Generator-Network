Uwe Rosler has turned down the chance to take over as head coach of 1860 Munich.

The fallen giants of German football are struggling, at the moment third from the bottom of 2.Bundesliga.

Rosler, 46, has been out work since he was sacked by Wigan in November but rejected the offer to replace Markus von Ahlen, who took over at 1860 Munich in September from former Spurs skills coach Ricardo Moniz.

Rosler was sacked as manager of Wigan in November last year and wants to manage again in England

The 46-year-old took Wigan to the FA Cup final last season but were beaten by Arsenal

The idea of a return to his native Germany appealed to Rosler but he is based in England and has not given up on another opportunity in this country.

During his 11 months at Wigan, Rosler took the club to the FA Cup semi-finals and into the play-offs.

This season started badly but has got worse since he left and was replaced by Malky Mackay.

Before joining Wigan, he enjoyed success at Brentford and they were on the way to promotion from League One when he took the move to the DW Stadium in December 2013.
