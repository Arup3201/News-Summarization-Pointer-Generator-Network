A young man had to be rescued by a passing boat after jumping into a freezing river during an alternative ice bucket challenge. 

Carl Pritchard, 21, had been nominated by friends to take part in the challenge. The social media craze involves participants pouring a bucket of freezing water over their heads.

But the young man, from Stanley, Durham, decided to take the stunt one step further - by jumping into the River Tyne.

Mr Pritchard lept into the river from Newcastle’s Quayside as his friends filmed the moment on camera.

But he immediately got into difficulties as he struggled to cope with the cold water and tidal currents. His friends, who were standing nearby on the quayside, were unable to help him.

After hearing his cries for help, a power boat racer taking part in a nearby Grand Prix event had to rescue the man from the water.

The team, who had been at Zapcat Racing Grand Prix, rushed to help Mr Pritchard. It included racing champion Daren Ford and paramedic Dan Major.
