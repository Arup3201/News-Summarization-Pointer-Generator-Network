The wife of British hostage Alan Henning has called on 'the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband', describing him as a 'peaceful, selfless man'.

Mr Henning, a former taxi driver from Bolton, was taken hostage last December in Syria by ISIS while he was trying to deliver aid to victims of the country's civil war.

The 47-year-old aid worker was shown at the end of a video last week after the beheading of fellow British captive David Haines.

Mr Henning's wife Barbara said she has sent messages to ISIS asking them to release her husband but has had no response.

In a statement released through the Foreign Office she said: 'Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need.

'When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need.

'His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion.

'I cannot see how it could assist any State's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying.'

She added: 'I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late.'

It is the first time Mr Henning's family has issued a public statement since he was threatened in the ISIS video earlier this month. 

The extremist group has previously released footage showing the killing of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

A separate video released this week showed British photojournalist John Cantlie sitting at a desk reading from a prepared script and explaining that he would speak about IS in future videos. There was no threat to kill Mr Cantlie made on camera.

A series of pleas for the release of Mr Henning have been made by high-profile Muslim leaders in recent days, warning IS that the killings and threats are against Sharia law.

Renowned Jihadi ideologue Muhammed al-Maqdisi and the family of jailed Pakistani scientist Dr Aafia Siddiqui, nicknamed 'Lady al Qaida', whose release has been demanded by ISIS extremists, have also called for Mr Henning to be released.

Mr Henning had just arrived in Syria in December 2013 when he was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists 

'I am Barbara Henning, the wife of Alan Henning.

'Alan was taken prisoner last December and is being held by the Islamic State.

'Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need.

'When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need. His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion.

'I cannot see how it could assist any state's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying.

'I have been trying to communicate with the Islamic State and the people holding Alan. I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to.

'I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late.

'When they hear this message I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband Alan Henning.'

Meanwhile, ISIS has released forty nine hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey, 

Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the hostages had been returned to Turkey following intense negotiations. 

The hostages were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when ISIS  overran the city in its surge to seize large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two US journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group, but it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages.

Deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc said the hostages are 49 Turkish consulate employees - 46 Turks and three local Iraqis - including consul general Ozturk Yilmaz, other diplomats, children and special forces police. 

Thirty two Turkish truck drivers who were also seized in Mosul on June 6 were released a month later. Turkey did not provide information surrounding their release. 

Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said the hostages had been held in eight separate addresses in Mosul. Their whereabouts were monitored by drones and other means, it said.

The Anadolu Agency reported no ransom had been paid and 'no conditions were accepted in return for their release'. Citing no sources, the agency also reported there were five or six previous attempts to secure the Turks' release, but none of them were successful.
