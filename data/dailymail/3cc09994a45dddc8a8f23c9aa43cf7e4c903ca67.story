Elise Christie suffered Winter Olympics heartache for the second time this week after being disqualified in her 1,500 metres heat, and revealed she had been subjected to cruel abuse on Twitter after causing a pile-up in the 500m final on Thursday.

Short-track skater Christie, who prefers the 1000m event, looked more relaxed before putting in a final burst which saw her edge Italy's Arianna Fontana in a photo-finish before she was penalised and placed in last position.

Within minutes of the finish of the heat it emerged that Christie had been penalised for an infringement at the finish line.

Close call: Elise Christie was adjudged to have made an infraction on the finishing line and was disqualified

Upset: Elise Christie was penalised before being disqualified from the 1500m event in Sochi

The 23-year-old Scot was devastated to be disqualified in the final of the 500m on Thursday for crashing into Fontana and was visibly upset after her second stroke of bad fortune.

Fighting
 back tears, Christie said she had been the victim of threatening 
messages on social media following her first disqualification.

'I have had a few people threatening me,' she told the BBC.

'It's been a tough few days.'

Sportsmail understands the abuse originated in Korea. The trigger is believed to be Christie crashing, when she sent Park Seung-Hi sprawling.

Controversial: But Christie still has the 1000m to look forward

Heartbreak: Christie's late burst took her over the line in the heat but an infraction meant she was disqualified

The Korean skater recovered to finish
 the race and was bumped up to the bronze-medal position when Christie 
was pushed down the field.

Short-track
 speed skating is known to have a fervent following and, insiders within
 the sport, say that instances of partisanship spilling over into abuse 
is not totally unheard of. Christie’s management have taken down her Twitter account.

Speaking
 about Saturday's disqualification, she said: 'I'm gobsmacked. I expected 
the decision the other day but today I have no ideas what's going on.

'I'm finding it quite hard.'

There was more disappointment for Team GB in the next heat.

Gilmartin, who reached the quarter-finals of the 500m earlier in the week, also failed to finish in the top three.

Upset: Christie was also disqualified after causing a pile-up in the 500m event

Ouch: Christie was penalised despite finishing second

The 23-year-old from Nottingham, current European 1500m bronze medallist, finished fifth out of six.

Christie's result was initially flagged up as 'penalty' which was later changed to 'DNF' (did not finish).

GB short track coach Nicky Gooch, by way of explanation, said: "The referee has said Elise didn't cross the line.

'She has crossed inside the finish line and he has ruled that that is off-track.

'Therefore he is saying she hasn't finished the race.

'She
 (has) done nothing wrong in the race, tried to make sure she was 
nowhere near Arianna and get her on the line, but the referee has called
 off-track.

'It has been called before but not something that normally happens.

'I was shocked. I looked at the video and you are talking centimetres.'

Great Britain short-track speed skating performance director Stuart Horsepool said: ‘We are talking about the smallest margin ever. There is nothing we can do. She won the race, we are absolutely devastated.

‘She was trying to win the race, she was lunging for the line. She was making sure she was safe and she went what we are talking millimetres. These things happen in sport and there is no accounting for it.

‘Luck doesn't even come into it. We have to pick ourselves up and come back on Tuesday and hopefully we can have good luck instead of all this horrendous back luck.’
