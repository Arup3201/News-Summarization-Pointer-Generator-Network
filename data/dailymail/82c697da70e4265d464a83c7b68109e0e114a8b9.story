Manhunt: Two of the suspects fled in the 2012 silver Range Rover owned by the victom. Two others followed in a speeding green Subaru that has now been identified as registered to the mother of Basim Henry

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

It is believed that he had refused to hand over his keys, but police said Saturday they believe it was his car, and not the victim, who was the target of the attack.

The assailants drove off in his silver Range Rover, which was found the next morning in Newark, about 10 miles from Short Hills.

The shooting took place as Mr Friedland and his wife, Jamie Schare Friedland, were ending a shopping trip. Mourners at his funeral on Wednesday said he had just opened the door of his SUV for his wife when he was shot.

At his funeral, his 27-year-widow said: ‘Dustin was the most chivalrous person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

'He wasn't here [with us] long enough, but he did so much while he was,' she said. 'I was lucky to be with him for his forever.'

The couple met while studying at Syracuse University. Mr Friedland gained a law degree and worked as a project manager for his family's heat and air conditioning company.

They married in 2011 and had dreamed of starting a family together.
