Fears that North Korea is planning a nuclear test to coincide with Barack Obama's Asia visit have prompted the United States to warn Kim Jong-un not to threaten regional peace.

The South Korean government reportedly said that heightened activity had been detected at North Korea's underground nuclear test site, indicating possible preparations for another atomic test.

The U.S president is visiting Japan today and is due in Seoul on Friday, where he is expected to discuss ways to deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.

And State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted they were closing watching Pyongyang and the Korean pennisula.

She said: 'We have certainly seen the press reports ... regarding possible increased activity in North Korea's nuclear test site.

'We continue to urge North Korea to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security and to comply with its international obligations and commitments.'

Kim Min-seok, the South Korean' defence ministry spokesman, said that 'a lot of activity' was being seen at the Punggye-ri test site.

North Korea warned last month it would not rule out a 'a new form' of nuclear test after the United Nations Security Council condemned Pyongyang for launching ballistic missiles into the sea.

On the Air Force One flight carrying Obama to Asia yesterday, White House spokesman Jay Carney was asked about the reports that North Korea may be preparing a nuclear test.

'North Korea has a history of taking provocative actions and we are always mindful of the possibility that such an action could be taken,' he told reporters.

'There is a kind of cyclical nature to the provocative actions that North Korea tends to take and we'll be watching it very closely.'

Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates North Korea has begun new operations at Punggye-ri, said 38 North, a North Korea monitoring website run by Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

The activity 'could represent an early stage of preparations for a test or may be intended for a less provocative purpose, such as conducting maintenance after a long winter' 38 North concluded.

Nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis, of the Monterey Institute of International Studies in the United States, said this month that the reference to a new form of test could mean simultaneous detonation of two or more devices as part of a programme of more intense nuclear testing expected over the next few years.

While North Korea has detonated several nuclear devices since 2006, analysts doubt it has the technical capability to reliably mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.

Diplomats have said it is possible the U.N. Security Council will respond to last month's North Korean missile tests by expanding a sanctions blacklist to include more North Korean entities involved in Pyongyang's missile program. But they said it could take weeks to reach agreement.

The council expanded its sanctions on North Korea after its third nuclear test in February 2013.

The United States said it held 'productive' talks with China on North Korea last week, part of stepped up international diplomacy after Pyongyang's nuclear test warning.
