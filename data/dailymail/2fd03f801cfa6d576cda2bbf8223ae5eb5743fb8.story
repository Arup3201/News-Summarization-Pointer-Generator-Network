A Texas couple were tragically killed in an EF-4 tornado a year ago.

But two heartwarming love letters written by Bob Whitehead to his wife Glenda almost 50 years ago from Vietnam survived the deadly storm, and have found their way back to their family.

Whitehead's sister, Ann Webb, was devastated when a twister tore through Granbury on May 15, 2013, destroying the home where her brother and his wife built a life and cutting their lives short.

A few precious photos survived, and were found scattered across the city. But a stranger came across a love letter, almost intact after half a century, on her front porch blocks from the Whiteheads' house.

Tragic: Bob Whitehead, left, and his wife Glenda, right were tragically killed in an EF-4 tornado a year ago in Granbury, Texas

Found: But a heartwarming love letter, pictured, written almost 50 years ago from Vietnam survived the deadly storm, and has found its way back to their family

Hoping to reunite it with its owner, the resident took the letter to the local newspaper, which is how Webb first heard about it.

'My darling sweet Glenda, I love you, baby,' the letter reads. 

Webb can't continue past that point. 'That's as far as I can go. I can't go any further. I can't go any further,' she told KVUE, tears welling in her eyes.

The letter was dated Sunday, October 16, 1966.

Twister: The tornado left only debris where the couple's house once was

Moved: Ann Webb, pictured, had no idea the letters existed

At the time, Bob Whitehead was a young soldier in Vietnam, separated from his even younger bride, Glenda, who he had grown up with as children and would spent 48 years married to before dying together in their home.

'A lot of love. He missed her a lot,' Webb said of her brother. 'He missed her a lot.'

Webb buried the original copy of the letter with her brother and made a copy for her daughter, Denise.

But three weeks after the funerals, another letter appeared in the hands of another stranger.

Love: Webb, pictured, at the couple's grave, said the pain of the loss is still fresh but she feels their love will live on

'Darling, it's late and I'm tired. How I wish I was with you. Love forever, Bob,' it read. She kept this one for herself.

Webb said her brother and Glenda couldn't have lived without one another.

'That's who they were. That's exactly who they were. They were always together,' Webb told KVUE.

She said while the pain of their sudden deaths was still raw, the letters feel like a message that their love will live on forever.
