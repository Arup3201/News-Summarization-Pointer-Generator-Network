The traditional dimpled glass pint tankard is usually associated with old men wearing flat caps – but the chunky-handled beer jug is now proving a big pull among pub-going hipsters.

In the early 2000s it seemed that the handled pint jug – which first appeared in pubs in the late 1920s - was on the road to extinction. The last British factory to make the handled beer jug, Ravenhead Glass in St Helens, closed down in 2001, pub landlords found straight pint glasses easy to stack in dishwashers – and beer drinkers preferred them, too.

But a beer jug revival is now underway thanks to trendy drinkers and city hotspots embracing them – and Al Murray the Pub Landlord toasting his audiences with them.

The Shacklewell Arms in Dalston, east London, a popular haunt with hipster-types, has been serving dimpled jugs for the past six months. It offers straight glasses, too, but it’s the jugs that the customers prefer.

General Manager Rose Dennen told MailOnline: 'The new love of dimpled pint glasses is part and parcel of the revival of the traditional idea of living. People are more aware of what they're putting in their bodies. It's all about being kind to yourself and being aware of your heritage and part and parcel of that is a return to craft beer.

'People aren't drinking less, but drinking better quality products.'

Dimpled mugs have been served in Leeds’ North Bar since 2000, with director Christian Townsley revealing that his mainly artistic clientele love the ‘old-school coolness’ of a dimpled tankard, according to the BBC.

Evolution: Straight glasses were very popular in the early 20th century and then in the 1960s, but their rims would often nick when they touched, so the nonic glass, right, was brought in to stop this happening

Pint glasses were straight from the beginning of the 20th century up until around 1928, when the 10-sided handled glass pint mug appeared in pubs.

In 1948 the dimpled pint jug design arrived, which proved more popular than its 10-sided cousin.

According to beer blogger Martyn Cornell, this new trend coincided with lighter coloured beers being embraced.

He said: 'The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over (dark) mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight-sides ones: the light shining through a pint of bitter in a dimpled glass is the beery equivalent of the windows of Salisbury or Chartres.'

Straight pint glasses became all the rage in the 1960s, but their rims easily chipped when they touched, so the 'nonik' - or 'no nick' - glass was invented, which has a bulge in the middle. This meant the glasses touched at a sturdier point and so didn't have to be replaced so often.

Lofty, narrow glasses are in vogue these days - often emblazoned with the logo of a beer brand.

He added: ‘They are solid and reassuringly comforting.’

Neil Walker, spokesperson for the 
Campaign For Real Ale, said that some pubs use traditional pint pots to 
help drinkers distinguish between brands.

He told MailOnline: ‘It's fantastic to see dimpled pint glasses making something of a comeback as real ale continues to grow in popularity, particularly in venues which might not have previously served cask beer.

‘Britain is in the middle of a real ale revolution. With well over a thousand breweries now producing real ale, your local pub is now much more likely to be serving a locally produced brew.

'Many pubs which are expanding their beer range are using these traditional pint pots to differentiate their cask beers from mainstream lager brands, something which can only be good for British beer drinkers.’

The Pub Landlord, meanwhile, is also toasting the dimpled pint jug's return.

He said: 'The return of these glasses is a triumph. Each one looks like a precious cut diamond but contains something better than 24 carats: one pint. For the first time in my life I salute the young and trendy. Though they should all bloody shave.'

Recent research shows that craft beer isn't just proving evermore popular in trendy pubs, but is catching wine as the drink of choice to take to dinner parties.

Over half of Brits say they already prefer to take beer, not wine to dinner parties, or plan to make the switch soon, according to a new nationwide poll, by online marketplace EeBria.

The site found that the trend is most pronounced among under 35s, who are 20 per cent more likely to drink craft beer over wine at social occasions than older generations.

A number of factors are driving the shift in attitudes, the research showed, with 60 per cent of respondents saying they see craft beers as the ideal way to explore new exciting flavours with friends and almost half believe craft beer sparks more interesting conversation than wine.

The 
handled pint pot so loved by craft beer drinkers first appeared in British pubs in 1928 and had a 
10-sided design. The dimpled design first appeared in 1948, according to
 beer blogger Martyn Cornell.

He
 said: ‘The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter 
over (dark) mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in
 straight-sides ones.’

British
 pubs buy their dimpled glassware from factories based oversea, with a 
jug costing around three times the price of a straight pint glass.
