QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has been charged with misconduct after allegedly insulting a match official.

The charge relates to Ferdinand's behaviour 'in or around the tunnel' after QPR's 2-1 defeat at home to Tottenham in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

 The former QPR and Tottenham striker has been director of football at the club since early February

An FA statement read: 'It is alleged that Ferdinand, director of football at QPR, used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a Match Official in or around the tunnel area after the end of the fixture.

'He has until 6pm on 13 March 2015 to respond to the charge.'

QPR were denied two penalties against Tottenham, as Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris brought down Mauricio Isla, and Nabil Bentaleb appeared to block Charlie Austin's shot with his hands late on.

The defeat leaves Rangers 18th in the table and three points adrift of safety with 10 matches remaining.
