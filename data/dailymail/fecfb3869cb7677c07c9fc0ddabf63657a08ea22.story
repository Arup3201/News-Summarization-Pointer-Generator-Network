Simon Cowell will be reunited with his pregnant love Lauren Silverman this week, MailOnline can reveal today.

Friends of the New York socialite have revealed the brunette, who is believed to be around 12 weeks pregnant, is jetting off to Europe to see the X Factor mogul tomorrow.

A source who is close friends with Lauren, 36, and part of her social circle on the Upper East Side of Manhattan said: ‘Lauren is so excited. It will be the first time she has actually seen Simon in weeks, she really loves him and they can't wait to be together.'

The couple have been in constant 
contact, however, and speaking tonight at the One Direction movie premiere in 
London tonight, Cowell, 53, broke his silence as he told Magic FM's Jo Parkerson that 
he's 'ready, excited and very happy’ about the baby, calling Lauren ‘a
lovely girl'.

He then told the BBC that he was 'proud', adding: 'Things are changing in my life right now, for the better.

'I'm proud to be a dad...It's something I hadn't thought of before, but now I know I feel good about it.'

The X Factor boss added: 'She (Lauren)'s a very special girl.'

It
will actually be the first time that Lauren, whose divorce from property millionaire Andrew Silverman was agreed last week, has seen Cowell 
since news of her pregnancy broke earlier this month.

She could even meet Cowell's mother, Julie, 87, during her flying visit.

Lauren has spent the past few weeks holed up at her $4million rental home 
in the Hamptons alongside her seven-year-old son Adam and her soon-to-be
ex-husband as they agreed a deal that includes joint custody.

However, the socialite has been supported by close friends including New York fashion 
designer Rachel Roy, who has given her romance with Cowell her blessing –
and in fact, took the now infamous picture of the couple canoodling on 
board the Slipstream yacht while on vacation in St Barths in January, which Lauren captioned ‘me and my little Simey monster.’

Stunning Rachel, 39, who has a young daughter with her ex-husband Damon Dash, has been a constant presence on board Cowell's yacht - and also joined her friend Lauren and the music millionaire on vacation in Sardinia last summer.

Good pal, Manhattan nutritionist 
Tanya Zuckerbrot has also been by Lauren's side and a source said: 
'Lauren's friends have been supporting her throughout everything - and I
don't think it's too hard for them to stick by Lauren when they get to enjoy all the perks that 
come with hanging around Simon Cowell.'

Meanwhile,
It was the question on everyone's lips on Tuesday night – whether 
Cowell would be bold enough to show his face at the One Direction movie 
premiere.

And being the bolshy
music mogul that he is, Cowell of course did turn up to the This Is Us 
screening in London’s Leicester Square.

He took a break from 
his current luxury yacht break in the Mediterranean to support his 
former X Factor stars as they launch their film.

In
fact, he didn't only show up to the red carpet event, but he also made 
light of the fact he is to become a father for the first time.

As
he arrived at the premiere he joked about his pride at how far Harry 
Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Niall Horan had 
come.

He said: 'This is like a dream come true... I feel like a father.' To which the host jested back: 'We won't go there!' 

And
if that wasn't enough, his ex fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy and former flame and best friend Sinitta joined him 
at the premiere.

Cowell followed 
closely behind the boys as they were greeted by scores of screams from 
fans who had camped out in the area for a prime red carpet spot ahead of
the screening.
