Queens Park Rangers are hoping to take Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah on loan until the end of the season.

Much depends on their budget though with QPR struggling to finance deals following the arrival of Mauro Zarate from West Ham.

The 22-year-old Salah has made just the 13 Premier League appearances since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Basle a year ago and has also attracted interest from Sunderland, West Brom and Inter Milan.

Meanwhile, Chelsea youngster Todd Kane is joining Nottingham Forest on loan after being recalled from a spell at Bristol City.

League One City wanted to keep the 21-year-old right back, who joined them in November, but Chelsea are keen for him to play in the Championship.

Borussia Dortmund remain determined to keep hold of Mats Hummels this window despite Manchester United's desire to sign the Germany defender.

Rumours are rife that United have made an offer but Dortmund are struggling to rectify a poor season and selling their captain now would only aggravate disgruntled fans further.

The club also opened talks with Marco Reus about a new contract although he and his advisers have apparently asked that a buy-out clause remains intact, something the club is reluctant to agree.

Andros Townsend's return to form means Tottenham are unlikely to consider letting him go this month. Several Premier League sides including West Brom, Crystal Palace, QPR and Everton hold an interest in the England international who had lost his way a little following injury last season. 

However, Mauricio Pochettino has been happy with the 23-year-old's performances of late and believes he has a role to play.

Townsend said: 'Unless the club come and tell me they want me to leave then I won’t be going anywhere. I’m fighting for my shirt. The last six or seven windows have been the same, with my name linked with other clubs.'

Team-mate Aaron Lennon remains a target for West Bromwich Albion though. New manager Tony Pulis wants a left back, two wingers and a midfielder to bolster his squad.

West Ham United midfielder Diego Poyet is wanted on loan by Championship side Watford.

The 19-year-old has made four appearances since his summer move from Charlton and came on as a substitute for Matt Jarvis in Tuesday night's FA Cup draw with Everton at Goodison Park.

He had a loan spell with Huddersfield earlier in the season and they are interested too.

Watford, however, are fifth in the Championship, seven points off leaders Bournemouth, and believe a couple of shrewd acquisitions this month could give them the extra edge required to challenge for promotion.

West Ham are open to the loan as they want Poyet to keep developing and he needs competitive games for that to happen.

Watford, meanwhile, are giving a trial to Vujadin Savic. The Serbian centre back played just over an hour in a back three for Watford Under 21s against Leeds United this week. They scored five first-half goals in a 6-1 victory in the Premier League Under 21 Cup.

The 24-year-old Savic has previously played for Bordeaux and was on loan at Dynamo Dresden and Arminia Bielefeld. 

Stoke's ambitious bid to sign Xherdan Shaqiri could meet an abrupt end as the Switzerland international is poised to tell Bayern Munich he wishes to join Inter Milan.

Bayern had hoped Liverpool would come to the table but that has not materialised and Inter have offered a £2m loan fee with £10m to follow over the next three years.

Stoke expect winger Victor Moses and new signing Philipp Wollscheid to both be in training on Wednesday when the first-team squad reports back from a two-day break. Moses has been out since November with a thigh injury.

Newcastle have no plans to sell Moussa Sissoko this month. There have been enquiries from agents looking to broker deals for Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal but it is understood that no formal approaches have been made. Talks are ongoing over a new contract for the 25-year-old who is valued at around £20m.

Southampton are looking to buy Dundee's teenage striker Craig Wighton. 

The 17-year-old has impressed scouts enough for the club to offer £200,000. 

Swansea City and Sunderland have also watched him closely over the past season and Dundee will find it hard to turn down offers but will look capitalise on one of Scotland's brightest young talents. Blackburn have shown an interest also.

Brentford are battling it out with Red Bull Salzburg for Sturm Graz striker Marco Djuricin.

Manager Mark Warburton has just two fit strikers and Djuricin, 22, is among the names on his radar. The Austrian Under 21 international is in the final year of his deal at Graz and is looking to move on this month.
