Pet peeve: Being left on hold was revealed as the most hated way of wasting time in a new survey

Of all the things that grind the gears of the British public, being left on hold and receiving cold calls have been revealed as the most annoying.

A survey of pet hates showed that having your time wasted on the phone was the worst of all everyday annoyances.

Other frustrating time-wasters identified by the survey included being stuck at home while a delivery shows up, getting caught in traffic and having your flight delayed.

More than a third of respondents to the survey, produced for Barclays, added that waiting for a replacement card from their bank drives them round the bend.

As well as things which waste time specifically, the bank also found out then ten most prevalent pet hates.

Time-wasting cold callers stole a march on the competition, shortly followed by annoying hold music, showing that the biggest frustrations still revolve around the phone.

But shopping woes weren't far behind, with 42 per cent of people admitting they have no time for slow people at the check-out, and 40 per cent hitting out at rude shop assistants.

Stepping in chewing gum, people who talk loudly on the phone and being tailgated in the car were also revealed as top frustrations.

Hated: Getting stuck in traffic was another frequent frustration

Catherine McGrath of Barclays 
said: 'It's little surprise that in today's fast-paced world, our time 
comes at an absolute premium.

'With
the majority of what we want now just a click away, it's no wonder 
people are feeling frustrated when having to wait for things such as 
replacement debit cards, especially when we're forced to cancel plans at
short notice as a result.'
