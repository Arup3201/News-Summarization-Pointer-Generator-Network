A skin specialist to the stars has been arrested for plotting to kill a competitor who had moved in to her building, it has been reported.

Dawn DaLuise, who has counted Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alicia Silverstone and Christian Slater among her clients at her West Hollywood, California salon, was arrested on Wednesday, according to TMZ.

The 55-year-old was reportedly angered when another esthetician moved into the same building as her salon, Skin Refinery.

She allegedly hired a former Detroit Lions player as a hit man to kill the competitor, TMZ reported.

But she seemingly told the wrong person about her murder-for-hire plan, who let it slip to another acquaintance who then went to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

She was arrested on Wednesday for solicitation to commit murder and is currently being held on $1 million bail.

'On Tuesday, March 4, 2014, detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department's Fraud and Cyber Crimes Bureau, received information on a cyber stalking case which started from the West Hollywood area,' the Los Angeles Sheriff Department said in a statement, ABC reported.

While investigating the cyber stalking allegation, 'separate information was obtained regarding an alleged solicitation for murderâ€¦ Dawn DaLuise, was arrested and booked at West Hollywood station'.

According to previous reports, DaLuise once irked Nicki Minaj after waxing her eyebrows.

'Look what you did to my damn face! You think this s*** is worth $170?!' Minaj reportedly yelled at DaLuise during the incident in November 2011.

'Itâ€™s a shame when you see a darling girl turn into a temperamental diva,' DaLuise told RadarOnline at the time.

A representative for DaLuise told MailOnline they did not have a comment at present.

According to her website, DaLuise moved to California to become a model in the 1980s.

Driven
 by her own sun damaged skin, she enrolled in beauty school in the 1990s
 and treats clients with electrical muscule stimulation, rather than 
'steams and creams'.

Her 
Electrical Muscle Stimulation facials cost $125 a session and claim to 
help dru skin, wrinkles or damage from chemical peels. A 40-minute 
facial costs $80, while wax treatments cost up to $90.

DaLuise also includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Alicia Silverstone, Alyson Hannigan,  Christina Ricci, Kyra Sedwick and Bridget Moynahan among her clients.
