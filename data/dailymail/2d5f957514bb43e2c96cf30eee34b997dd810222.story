No bowler would wish to be the subject of withering criticism from Michael Holding but for England paceman Chris Jordan the barbs of the legendary West Indian have added resonance.

Jordan, born and raised in Barbados before earning a scholarship to Dulwich College at 16, endured a difficult afternoon with the ball in India’s first innings at the Ageas Bowl, sending down four wides in a wayward spell that raised questions over his unconventional approach to the crease. 

Holding’s criticism was fierce, with the Sky analyst claiming the 25-year-old’s confidence was ‘shattered’ while highlighting a string of technical problems he says need fixing.

Not holding back: The former West Indian seamer was fierce in his opinions on Jordan 

Keep it quick: Jordan said he is always looking to improve and would 'enjoy' talking to Holding about the game 

Jordan insisted: ‘My approach to the crease is different but everyone is unique and different things work for different people and that works for me right now. I don’t intend changing too much. 

'You’re always looking to improve as a cricketer and if you get a window where you can improve then I’d be more than happy to work on it. But at this moment I don’t see too much that I need to change.

‘Playing international cricket is all about having a strong mind and strong character — sticking to what has got you to that stage in the first place.

‘Michael Holding has vast international experience and was a great fast bowler. You’re always looking to learn new things and push your game on. He’s someone I’d probably enjoy speaking to about the game.

‘In the first innings everything didn’t go according to plan. There were a couple of balls that didn’t come out of the fingers quite right. But it’s nothing I’m too worried about because I put it right in the second innings.

‘I’m not the sort of player who gets too caught up in disappointments. It’s all about how you come back from those disappointments. I’ll just mark it down as one bad day in my international career.’
