One of the top contenders for the most Earth-like world beyond our solar system is not a real planet but a cosmic masquerade.

This is according to new research that claims what astronomers believed to be Gliese 581g was simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star.

When it was first discovered in 2010, Gliese 581g excited astronomers as it looked similar to Earth in both size and temperature.

It was, they believed, the first planet outside our solar system in the Goldilocks zone around its star – an area not too hot and not too cold for life.

Now, researchers at Pennsylvania State University have shown that what was found wasn't a planet at all.

They also claim that another planet in the same solar system, known as Gliese 581d, announced in 2009 and less hospitable to life, doesn't exist. Three outside experts agreed.

Pennsylvania State University astronomer Paul Robertson said that the two planets turned out to be magnetic outbursts from a star.

Gliese 581 (the bright star shown in the centre), which is 22 light-years away, has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone

'This result is exciting because it explains, for the first time, all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star Gliese 581,' said Dr Robertson.

Gliese 581, which is 22 light-years away, has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone.

To find Gliese 581g, University of California, Santa Cruz astronomers looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star.

The strength of the tugging, they thought, showed them a planet was about three times as massive as Earth.

The discovery of Earth-like planets around Gliese 581 caught the public imagination.

Documentary-maker RDF and social-networking site Bebo used a radio telescope in Ukraine to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radiowaves - to Gliese 581.

And the Australian science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of Twitter to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries.

But were doubts at the time of the discovery. For instance, Swiss astronomers cast doubt on the original research claiming they could find no trace of the planet in their own analysis of the same data.

Other exoplanets have previously been doubted, most notably Alpha Centauri Bb, the closest Earth-sized world to us which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data.

Dr Robertson said that the unmasking of Gliese 581 d highlights the need to remain cautious amid the recent rise in exoplanet discoveries.

A frozen world, similar to Earth, that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life.

The new planet, located 3,000 light years away, is twice as massive as Earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the Earth is from the sun.

Until the discovery, no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system. Planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common.

'This greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,’ said Professor Scott Gaudi, from Ohio State University.

'Half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems. We had no idea if Earth-like planets in Earth-like orbits could even form in these systems.'

Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun.

It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back orbits, and is almost certainly a lifeless world.

But the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun-like star would be in the 'habitable zone' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life.
