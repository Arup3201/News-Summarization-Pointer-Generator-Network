It is the modern phenomenon that makes us the star of our travel snaps - the unavoidable selfie.

But there is a time and a place for a quick self-referencing moment of camera fun.

And when you're being chased by an angry bovine in the middle of a bull run, it is not the most sensible moment to stop and take a snap.

But that's exactly what this amateaur 'matador' decided to do, while running down the streets away from the rampaging animal in the French city of Bayonne.

Turning his back to snap the selfie in the video, every viewer can see what is going to happen next - except the tourist.

As he stops to take the photo, the angry bull comes running down the alleyway and charges straight into him.

Setting up the shot: The man readies himself for his moment of glory

He's behind you: The unsuspecting photographer doesn't seem to see his assailant closing in

Wrong time, wrong place: The man is about to pick up an unexpected souvenir of his trip

And as if being flung into the air - narrowly missing being gored - is not enough, once the bull has charged once, it quickly turns around for a second go, just as the photographer is getting to his feet.

Luckily, the man appears to walk away from his clash with the bull unhurt - but one would imagine his pride hasn't escaped unscathed.

Spain is not the only country where the dubious art of bull-running takes place during the summer months – as Bayonne, which sits near to the Atlantic coast in the south-west of the country – was demonstrating on Sunday.

And that's what happens: The man is knocked over as the bull charges forward

Now you have my attention: The man abandons his photographic plans as the bull continues to chase him

To
 his credit, at least the bull runner was wearing an all-white outfit of t-shirt and 
shorts – rather than a red ensemble which might have been more 
eye-catching for the rampaging bovine.

But turning his back on the bull as he tried to take his selfie was never likely to be a good idea – as the bull proved by ramming his head into the unobservant tourist’s bare legs.
