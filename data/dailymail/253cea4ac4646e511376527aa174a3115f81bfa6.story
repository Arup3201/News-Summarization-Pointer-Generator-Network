A desperate sister started a campaign to get a kidney for her dying sister after she was told she couldn’t donate.

But after her plea went worldwide doctors reconsidered and she has now saved her life by giving her  one of her own kidneys.

Celebrities including comic Ricky Gervais backed the campaign that Jude Skilton set up for her desperately ill sister, Jo Shipley, in a bid to find her a new life-saving kidney.

Jude was three when her sister 
Jo was born. Jo was born with spina bifida and at just at eight days old she needed her left kidney removed

In July last year Jo was referred to Bristol's Southmead Hospital and began dialysis.  She was also put on the transplant list - but with no guarantees of a donor

Thousands jammed a hospital switchboard, begging to get tested. But in the nick of time Jude pleaded with doctors to be tested again and was told she could be a donor.

Now she has given her little sister the greatest gift of all - a new life.

Mum of two Jude Skilton, 35, says: ‘It was the most painful experience of my life but the most amazing too. To see my sister Jo go from death’s door to blossoming before my eyes is nothing short of a miracle.

‘We’ve always had a close bond and taken the mickey out of each other and now I joke I’m  going to be taking the pee out of her for the rest of my life!’

Jude, who is three years older than Jo says: ‘She looked like a doll with her big blue eyes and blonde hair and she laughed constantly. But straightaway it was clear she’d face huge challenges.’

Jo was born with the congenital condition spina bifida - at the base of her spine was a huge fluid-filled lump and although her spinal cord was intact, the bones hadn’t formed properly.

At just eight days old, she had her left kidney removed.

She underwent numerous operations and suffered from kidney disease but despite her ill health she's always been determined to lead as normal a life as possible.

Jude says: ‘She was so gutsy and faced life head on. Her health problems didn’t stop her doing anything. 

‘Aged four she’d been in hospital five months having the lump removed from her back and bone grafts. When she came home our mum caught us both sliding down the stairs in a suitcase.

‘She’d climb trees, ride a bike, did everything I did. And our bond was amazing, we’d giggle with each other constantly.

Jude says that even as children she was 'so protective of her (Jo) that when I was six I promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it'

‘But I was so protective of her and and when I was six I promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it.

‘I think it gave her the idea that what was mine was hers - she was always pinching my clothes and makeup as a teenager!’

In their twenties the sisters married and had two sons each, during which time their bond remained strong. And despite kidney disease Jo was able to lead a fairly normal life. 

Jude says: ‘We’d see each other constantly and help out with the kids. 

We also supported each other when both our marriages broke down.

Jude went on to meet and marry her second husband Pete, 33, who runs an extreme sports website.

The sisters have always had a close bond and taken the mickey out of each other

In 2010 Jo also met her new partner Ben, now 27, and in 2011 they got engaged.

Jude says: ‘It was fantastic seeing her in love.  But then her sparkle began to fade. She was getting slower and said she felt groggy.  It wasn’t like her to complain.’ 

At the time Jo and Ben were running a pub but had to give up because of Jo’s failing health.

Then in July last year Ben had to rush her to A&E at their local hospital, Weston General, in Weston-super -Mare.

There doctors delivered the shattering news that Jo had kidney failure.

Jude says: ‘She’d lost so much weight where she was being sick all the time and she looked so ill and grey.  When the doctors said her remaining kidney was only functioning at eight percent I knew she was dying.

‘It was unbearable seeing the life draining out of my beautiful sister.’ 

Jo was referred to Bristol’s Southmead Hospital and began dialysis.  She was also put on the transplant list - but with no guarantees of a donor.

Their paternal grandfather, Roy, had died from kidney failure just six years earlier.

But Jude stepped in to keep her childhood promise. 

She says: ‘I told her not to worry, that she could have one of mine.  I’d always meant what I’d said and I wasn’t going to back out now.’ 

A blood test was carried out to see if she was match.

But in 2004 Jude had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which causes muscle pain and in the years that followed she’d suffered other unexplained symptoms.

She says: ‘I came up in itchy hives all over my body and I suffered from so much pain and exhaustion that for a long time I could barely leave the house.  If I did I needed a wheelchair to get around. ‘

Her symptoms left doctors baffled.  
At first they thought they were down to a post-viral infection, then 
their thoughts turned to a connective tissue disorder. But Jude’s blood 
tests came back clear and after a few years the symptoms diminished 
considerably.

However, because of her medical past, her application to donate was refused.

Jude
 says: ‘The bottom felt out of my world.  Worse still, Jo had seen the 
medical notes - which revealed that the blood test I’d had proved I was 
perfect match.  

‘It was unbearable, there I was carrying the one thing that could save Jo’s life yet I was unable to give it to her.’

Jo’s fiance Ben was tested and four of their friends, but none proved a match. 

But Jude refused to just sit back. She began an online blog about Jo and why she needed a kidney.  

She says: ‘I decided if I couldn’t help her then I wanted to find someone who could.’

Keeping it humorous, her blog exploded - as it was tweeted it went viral global  - sent on by a host of stars, including comedian Ricky Gervais.  

Jude says: ‘He sent his best wishes and retweeted the link to his 4.5 million followers - spreading the word about Jo.

Other celebrities became involved, including Boy George, H from Steps and some of the Emmerdale cast.

Would-be donors ended up jamming the hospital renal unit’s switchboard.

Then in October 2012 one doctor reviewed Jude’s medical notes, deciding that her unexplained symptoms were part of her fibromyalgia and nothing more sinister. 

He concluded her condition may not prevent her from becoming a possible donor.

Jude says: ‘I was ecstatic, now was my chance to save Jo but I didn’t realise it was only the first hurdle.’

For the next five months Jude had to fight her corner, trying to convince other medics that she was suitable and that she accepted the risks attached.

All the time Jo struggled on, as dialysis became less effective - yet without it she’d be dead within two weeks.

But finally Jude managed to convince every single one of them. Last stop was her husband Peter and their children Jake, 16 and Brandon,14.

Jude says: ‘They were so scared for me but I tried to reassure them and said it was just something I had to do, that I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do all I could to save Jo.’

Jude sailed through the normal series of tests.

And five months ago she was able to give her sister the gift of life as the transplant was carried out at Southmead Hospital via a keyhole procedure.

Jude even asked for a picture to be taken of her kidney before it was given into Jo.

She says: ‘As a big sister I’d always looked after Jo and I’d made that promise when we were little.

‘When they wheeled her back up onto the ward next to me and I saw her catheter filling up it was the best sight in the world - my kidney was doing its job, the transplant had worked.’

Jo adds: ‘‘What Jude’s done is truly amazing, I’m now back on my feet and I've never felt so good. She’s literally given me life and I’ll never be able to thank her enough.  

‘I didn’t realise how ill I was but now I have more energy than my kids.  And Jude’s kidney’s also come with an added extra - her big appetite!’
