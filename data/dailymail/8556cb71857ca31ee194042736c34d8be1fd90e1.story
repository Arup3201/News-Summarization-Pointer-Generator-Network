Mourning relatives of terminally ill teenager Alice Pyne today vowed to carry on her charity mission in her memory following the 17-year-old’s death after a brave battle with a form of blood cancer.

Determined not to waste a moment of the time she had left, the Hodgkin’s lymphoma sufferer swam with sharks, went to her school leavers’ prom, set up her own charity, and met the band Take That.

Now her parents Vicky and Simon have insisted they will continue fundraising on behalf of their late daughter - and her sister Milly, 14, is planning to climb Mount Kilimanjaro for charity later this year.

Gone but never forgotten: Alice Pyne, who touched the hearts of thousands of people with her 'bucket list' of wishes, has died, aged 17, after a long battle with cancer

Following Alice’s death on Saturday, 
Mrs Pyne said: ‘I will spend my life doing the things Alice wanted me to
 do - the charity, Anthony Nolan (Bone Marrow Trust) and an odd mountain
 or two.’

In an entry for a competition at 
Knowsley Safari Park in Prescot, Merseyside, Alice wrote of her sister: 
‘It makes me happy to know, that when I'm gone, she'll carry on 
spreading her magic. I love you Milly.'

Alice, who was diagnosed aged 13 and died with her family at her bedside, 
inspired millions after publishing a ‘bucket list’ of things she wanted
 to achieve before she died, on an internet blog.

The list went viral online and, as it 
caught media attention, she attracted support around the world to make 
her dreams come true.

Showing extraordinary enthusiasm and 
love of live, Alice, from Ulverston, Cumbria, achieved not only the 
goals on her bucket list but much more besides.

Tributes poured in for the plucky 
teenager yesterday after her parents, Simon and Vicky Pyne, announced 
her death at the weekend.

The last wish on Alice's list was to go whale watching (left). Her plight attracted the attention of a host of celbrities, including Sir Paul McCartney (right), pictured with Alice and her sister Milly in 2007

Despite her bucket list of wishes, Alice was determined to help others and raised more than £100,000 for charity

Her mother wrote on Facebook: ‘Our darling girl, Alice, gained her angel wings today.

‘She passed away peacefully with 
Simon, Milly and myself by her side. We are devastated and know that our
 lives will never again be the same. Night Night Alice.’

Hodgkin’s lymphoma sufferers  receive 
bone marrow transplants and blood stem cells to replace what is killed 
off during chemotherapy and radiation.

The top item on Alice’s list was her 
hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an 
aspiration praised by Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of 
Commons. Following campaigns by Alice, the Anthony Nolan blood cancer 
charity saw more than 40,000 sign up to its donor register.

She also set up the charity Alice’s Escapes, which helps parents with a seriously ill child go on holiday.

Last year Alice and her sister, Milly,
 14, were awarded a British Empire Medal for services to charity in the 
Queen’s Birthday Honours List. She also won the Pride of Britain 
Teenager of Courage award.

Among those paying tribute yesterday 
was comedian David Walliams, who posed as a penguin keeper to surprise 
Alice on a visit to London Zoo. He tweeted: ‘I am so sad about the 
passing of Alice Pyne. What a beautiful and courageous girl.’ Alice 
completed her ‘bucket list’ last August placing a final ‘DONE’ next to 
whale watching.

She said: ‘I never expected it [the 
bucket list] to be published to the whole world. I didn’t even expect to
 get the majority of my wishes fulfilled. Words can’t really explain it 
but I’m so happy it is done.’

Poignantly, her final post on her 
blog, on New Year’s Day, read: ‘Can’t believe I’m really saying ‘Happy 
New Year’ to you all. I don’t think there is a single doctor that would 
have expected me to be here when they sent me home over two years ago.’

It adds: ‘My New Year mission is to get a bit fatter which will hopefully give me more energy.’
