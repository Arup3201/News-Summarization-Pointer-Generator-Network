On the run: Jessica Carde, 58, is on the lam as authorities try to arrest her for her 12 outstanding felonies

A woman pretending to be a millionaire in search of a new home could not have been further from the truth and now she faces a dozen felony charges.

Jessica Carde, 58, is on the run after Seattle police have charged her with a series of theft charges stemming from her lavish mansion-hopping scheme.

She would suggest lease-purchase 
agreements, where the interested party pays small sums to the homeowner 
over time until they eventually purchase the home outright.

Carde
would never get passed a few payments before alleging that her identity
had been stolen and the great lines of credit that she had previously 
boasted about disappeared as a result.

Her alleged crime spree goes back for years, as she and her husband lost their $650,000 home in a foreclosure in 2006.

Since then, The Seattle Post Intelligencer reports that she has been living in a series of luxury homes throughout Washington state.

There are at least three instances where
she convinced homeowners who were looking to sell their mansions that 
she was well-off and extremely interested in eventually purchasing the 
properties.

Home sweet home: Jessica Carde, 58, allegedly lived in this $1.5million home in North Bend, Washington for 18 months

When tensions rose following the disappearing illusion of wealth, she allegedly turned to the authorities and made false police reports when the homeowners threatened to evict her. In one case she claimed the male owner said he would burn the house down around her, and in another she was allegedly threatened with imminent death.

Fast forward four years and several home stays later, she decided to look for individual men willing to lend her money.

Multiple targets: As well as hopping from home to home, including this one in Kirkland, she also convinced wealthy individuals and banks to give her loans of hundreds of thousands of dollars

In earlier cases, she came into meetings with homeowners armed with letters that said she was pre-qualified for a mortgage. Now she printed up new business cards that showed her wide-range of talents.

Hiding: This picture of Carde, clearly taken years ago, was listed under one of her aliases

She claimed to be an 'international speaker, trainer and consultant, personal/professional/executive life coach, neurobiofeedback technician/brain wave specialist, mediation specialist, health educator and instructor.'

Not only would she convince wealthy 
homeowners to let her live in their mansions with the expectation that 
she would eventually buy it from her, but she even convinced an ailing 
stroke victim to allow her to test out 'brain wires' on him in order to 
'cure' his ailments.

Police reports do not state how she met one elderly benefactor, but somehow she convinced him to lend her $142,100.

The unidentified man suffered a stroke
in 2010, and given her ficitious background as a brain wave specialist,
she convinced the man's wife to allow her to use her talents on him.

'She
said she could cure (him) with ‘brain wires’ and convinced his wife … 
to let her try. Carde placed electrodes on (his) head to ‘blast the 
clot’ away,' investigator Steven Sherman told the court.

Under construction: This North Bend home was another target of hers, though she also tried non-real estate rouses like when she used 'brain wires' to help 'shock' a blood clot in a stroke victim's brain

Carde tried to obtain a power of attorney letter to have control of the man's finances but his family interjected. She then told police that the man's wife was trying to kill him, and Carde was subsequently banned from the facility where he was being treated.

Police have now formally charged Carde with four counts of first degree theft, three charges of mortgage fraud, two of securities fraud, two of second-degree theft and one of attempted first-degree theft.
