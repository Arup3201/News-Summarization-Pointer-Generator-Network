Norwich manager Neil Adams will hold talks with left-back Martin Olsson after he appeared to raise his hand to referee Simon Hooper following his dismissal during their 1-0 defeat at Wolves.

Olsson was sent off on the hour mark after collecting two yellow cards for challenges on the Wolves winger Rajiv van La Parra.

Adams, whose side were beaten by a 64th-minute header from Dave Edwards, hopes that Olsson will not face any further action other than a standard one-match ban.

Hopeful: Neil Adams said he didn't see the incident but that he was hopeful that Olsson would avoid a long ban

He said: 'I haven't seen it and hopefully there is nothing in it.

'But we will have a look at it and see what it is and if there are any consequences from that.

'I will speak to Martin about that. Of course I will. I didn't see it because as soon as the card comes out you're looking away to what you are going to do. But I will have a look at it.

'The officials have said nothing to us about any alleged hands on and like I say I have not seen it for now. We will get the footage going back on the coach.

'But there has been nothing said or suggested to me as of yet from that. We will need to make inquiries if something has happened.'

Despite making the worst possible start to their bid to make an instant return to the Barclays Premier League, Adams refused to be too downcast but admitted that the loss of Olsson was pivotal.

He added: 'The second one was a stronger yellow than the first for me. We lost a player at a point where I thought we were controlling the game.

'We were looking good and pinning Wolves back and when the red card happens we get caught when we are down to 10 men.

'There were positives to take from the game but you are never happy when you lose.'

Edwards, who had missed an excellent chance after just 22 seconds, made no mistake when he rose unmarked to head home Van La Parra's cross.

It was a just reward for Wolves who had carried the greater threat all match through Van La Parra, Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko.

Norwich were lightweight in attack, their best chance falling to Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute.

Turning point: Adams said he thought the red card marked a change in momentum, allowing Wolves to score

But he was denied a goal on his debut following his £3million move from Bournemouth by a smart save from Carl Ikeme.

Wolves manager Kenny Jackett was delighted with his side's performance on their return to the Sky Bet Championship after winning the League One title last season.

Jackett said: 'First off it is a good win and a good day for the club.

'Pressure builds up through pre-season and everyone wants to get to that first day and to get a win on the first day is a big thing. With us coming into a new division that is great.

'But looking past that there are different types of challenges. You could see the way that Norwich defended their goal was very good and it was an excellent goal that won the game.

'It was a late run and a very, very good header into the far corner.

'There were crucial moments and the sending-off was one. That was pivotal as was Grabban's chance.

'Then Dave Edwards put that big chance in. They were pivotal moments in the game.'
