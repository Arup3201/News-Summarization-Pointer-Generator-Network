Defense giants Lockheed Martin is stopping all donations of the Boy Scouts of America as a result of the organizations continued ban on homosexual leaders.

The company said is will no longer support any nonprofit organizations that do not align with its commitment to diversity or corporate policies on equality.

Aerospace manufacturer Lockheed follows companies such as UPS Inc., Merck & Co. and computer-chip maker Intel in withdrawing support for the Boy Scouts over its anti-gay policy in the past two years.

Boy scout ban: Lockheed Martin is ceasing all financial support for the Boy Scouts over its continued ban on homosexual Scout leaders

Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has not disclosed how much it has contributed to the Boy Scouts over the years.

‘We believe engaging with and funding an organization that openly discriminates is in conflict with our policies,’ Lockheed Martin spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Thursday.

‘While we applaud the mission of the Boy Scouts and the good things they do in our communities, their policies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and religious affiliation conflict with Lockheed Martin policies.’

This year, the Boy Scouts of America revised its policy to allow homosexual young men to participate in Scouting, however, it maintained the ban on gay leaders.

The change drew criticism from both side, as several of the century-old organisation's sponsors are relatively conservative denominations - notably the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches.

Voice for equality: Lockheed Martin, who introduced the 100th F-35 fighter in Fort Worth, Texas, last Friday, has pulled its donations as Boy Scouts of America did not follow the company's commitment to diversity

The Boy Scouts's overall 'traditional youth membership' - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - is now about 2.6 million, compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers.

Of the more than 100,000 Scouting units in the U.S., 70 per cent are chartered by religious institutions.

Other companies who have made pro-equality statements have found themselves banned by organizations claiming to be 'supporting marriage'

Cookie brand Oreo found themselves boycotted by anti-gay campaigners after a photograph of a rainbow stacked cookie was posted onto to company Facebook page during Pride month.

General Mills, who owns household staple brands such as Betty Crocker, Cheerios and Green Giant, found themselves boycotter by the National organization for Marriage when they opposed the Minnestota Marriage Amendment.

Levi's upset Republican groups in 1992 when they pulled their funding over the Boy Scouts's 'Three Gs' rule, which welcomed anyone as long as they are not 'gay, godless or a girl'.

Clothing chain American Apparel saw a Washington, D.C. store vandalized by anti-LGBT protestors when they put a 'Legalize Gay' t-shirt in their window in 2009. They responded by promising tshirts to all gay rights groups in the state.

Mr Johndroe said Lockheed Martin was pleased to see the Boy Scouts revise its membership policy but opposes the continued ban on gay leadership.

The company's review of its philanthropy came at the end of the year as it reevaluates priorities for 2014, he said.

‘We're taking a close look at all nonprofit organizations we support to ensure they align with our company's core values,’ Johndroe said.

Deron Smith, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, said Lockheed Martin was not a national sponsor but has had a positive impact by supporting Scouting in local communities.

‘We respect the company's right to express its own opinion and appreciate its recognition that Scouting is a valuable organization,’ he said in an email.

‘Scouting believes that good people can personally disagree on this topic and still work together to accomplish the common good.’

As well as the lifting of the man on gay members, the recent appointment of a new Boy Scouts of America president has been hailed as a step in the right direction.

In October, the Boy Scouts of America announced that former Defense Secretary Robert Gates will serve as its next president to lead its national executive board for two years. Gates was an Eagle Scout.

As defense secretary under President Barack Obama, Gates helped change the military's ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell’ policy banning openly gay soldiers. He also served under President George W. Bush.

Gay-rights groups have praised the appointment of Gates and called on him to push the organization to end discrimination against gay adults.
