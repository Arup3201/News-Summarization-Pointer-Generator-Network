When your family is as upwardly mobile as the Middletons, and your big sister has already nabbed the top prize by marrying a future King, what’s a boy to do?

The answer, it would seem, is rebel. Because, if these pictures are anything to go by, James Middleton’s future wife is a single mother from a working-class Newcastle family.

Of course, she is also none other  than TV presenter Donna Air – but one still cannot help wondering what  Mr Middleton’s mother Carole will say when she sees the sparkling diamond on her ring finger.

Put a ring on it: Donna Air and boyfriend James Middleton are seen leaving the Serpentine Gallery summer party, and the former model flashed a ring on her ring finger

Miss Air, 33, set tongues wagging when
 she was spotted wearing the ring this week, just four months after she 
began dating 26-year-old Mr Middleton.

She flashed the rather conspicuous diamond as she and Mr Middleton left the Serpentine Gallery summer party hand in hand.

They even dressed to match, with both 
looking relaxed and summery in complementary shades of blue at the event
 in London’s Hyde Park.

Significant: Donna flashed the platinum band which was studded with diamonds as she sat in the back of the car

Despite a whole list of celebrity 
guests, including Mick Jagger and his family and actress Sarah  Jessica 
Parker, the pair had eyes only for each other throughout the evening.

They looked just as lovestruck  on the
 way home, with Miss Air clasping Mr Middleton’s hand in both of hers as
 they sat in the back of a taxi.

The couple began a discreet relationship in February after meeting at 5 Hertford Street, a private members’ club in Mayfair.

They were initially reluctant to be 
seen together, but were soon spotted holding hands on dog-walking dates 
in Hyde Park, and out for drinks with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Despite the age gap and their 
different backgrounds, the relationship reportedly has the approval of 
Mr Middleton’s sister Pippa, with whom he shares a flat in Chelsea.

Mr Middleton works for his parents’ 
party products website in Berkshire and runs his own Cake Kit Company, 
which produces cake-making kits and novelty cakes.

He has had few girlfriends and tends 
to mix with people from the same social set as Pippa and his other 
sister, the Duchess of Cambridge.

By contrast, Miss Air, the daughter of
 a builder who began her showbusiness career as a child star in TV show 
Byker Grove, has a colourful romantic past.

Six years ago, she separated from 
multi-millionaire zoo and casino owner Damian Aspinall.

The pair never 
married, but had a daughter, Freya. It was rumoured they broke up after 
Mr Aspinall refused to marry Miss Air.

Since the split she has dated several 
rich, older men, including John Dorrance IV, the London-based American 
heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, and Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born 
millionaire.

Miss Air recently told the Mail: ‘It 
has been an uphill struggle, as any woman starting again knows. It 
ain’t no picnic. It ain’t no walk in the park when you have children and
 you go through a separation.’

Unusual: Donna teamed her turquoise blouse with the maxi skirt with a fire-patterned hemline

Comfortable: The couple, who have been dating since February, looked at ease with each other

Along with her chequered love life, it 
also remains to be seen quite what Mrs Middleton will make of some of 
Miss Air’s professional activities.

She once wrote a blog for matchmaking 
website eHarmony in which she recommended ‘a spray tan, a Wonderbra, a 
vodka and tonic, and high heels’ before a date.

And in 2001 she presented a TV show 
called Fifty Ways To Tease Your Lover, advising women to please their 
boyfriends with a striptease, pole dancing and by dressing as a 
schoolgirl.

Loved up: the couple looked very close and tactile at the summer bash

Neither Mr Middleton nor Miss Air were
 available for comment last night.

But a friend insisted they were not 
about to walk down the aisle any time soon, claiming Miss Air was simply
 making a fashion statement with the ring.

The friend said: ‘The simple answer is no, they haven’t [got engaged]. I think it’s a fashion thing girls just sometimes do.’

Friends in high places: Donna and James's pal Princess Beatrice was also in attendance
