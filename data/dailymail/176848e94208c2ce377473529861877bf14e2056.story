At the end of last week familiar and worrying pictures emerged of Mario Balotelli from a Liverpool training session.

Sitting on his backside on the grass at Melwood, the Italian centre forward looked as though he was being coaxed to his feet by Brendan Rodgers.

Those who worked with Balotelli at Manchester City will have recognised the sketch straight away for whenever he used to make a mistake in training during his first stint in English football he would simply fall over.

A younger man back then, Balotelli's behaviour was interpreted by coaching staff at City as that of a player trying to hide embarrassment by feigning injury. It was endearing, for about a session-and-a-half. Then it wasn't.

'I had never seen anything like it,' said one of Roberto Mancini's coaches.

'When Mario made a mistake – like a wayward shot or a poor corner – he would often fall over, as though he was hurt.

'It was like watching a kid trying to cover up a mistake.

'It was ridiculous and, in the end, we just recognised it as classic Mario.

'When things go wrong, his first instinct is not to put them right but to look for excuses.'

As Balotelli's career stalls on the runway at Liverpool, Rodgers and his staff should be concerned.

The Liverpool manager has a brilliant record at Anfield of improving players. He has improved Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson, for example. He even managed to improve Luis Suarez. It's one of his qualities as a coach.

It may just be, though, that he has taken on too much with Balotelli. The signs of a downward spiral are already In place.

On Sunday at Loftus Road, the 24-year-old did not concentrate as much as he should, he did not work as hard as he should and, as a result, he did not execute in front of goal as well as he should.

One of the problems with the former Milan striker is that – deep down – he lacks mental strength and confidence. It is why he was so reluctant to mix socially during his time at City, why at times Mancini's own son had to be sent to coax him from his flat in Manchester city centre.

Balotelli has never really grasped what it takes to overcome difficulty. He reacts to adversity the wrong way.

At Loftus Road, young Sterling reacted to his own recent difficulties by running his legs in to the ground. He's back on track already.

Balotelli took a different route, though, and seeing video clips of him shooting from hopelessly ambitious positions, it was easy to remember him doing the same in the light blue of City and the dark blue colours of Italy during the summer's World Cup.

That's a classic Balotelli response to draining confidence. Just hit it and hope that something amazing happens. All too often it doesn't.

Unfortunately for Rodgers, Balotelli's current issues will start to affect team-mates at Melwood. They will react negatively to his aimless training efforts and his inability to bring something to the team even when his goalscoring form is beyond him.

One can only hope that something happens for him against Real Madrid on Wednesday night. It needs to happen soon. For history tells us that when Balotelli gets stuck in the wrong direction, he soon gathers all the negative momentum of a lorry heading for the edge of a cliff.
