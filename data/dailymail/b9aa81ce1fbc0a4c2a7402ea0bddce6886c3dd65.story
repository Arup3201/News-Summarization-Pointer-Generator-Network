A harrowing 911 call made by a 10-year-old girl as her mother was being stabbed to death was played to an Ohio court on Tuesday.

In the call, made on the morning of February 24, last year, the daughter of Tami Wong can be heard saying: 'My daddy’s murdering my mom.'

The girl's father, Glenn Wong, is currently on trial for murder after he was found over his wife's body, which had more than 100 stab wounds.

The couple's children were witnesses to the tragic events of that February morning, and have both described what they saw and heard to the court.

Summit County Assistant Prosecutor Angela Walls-Alexander, who held a framed photo of Tami Wong as she addressed the court, said the victim had 103 stab wounds caused by two kitchen knives.

She added that Mrs Wong died from 'critical loss of blood,' Ohio.com reported.

Her 51-year-old husband, who had been described in court as jealous and controlling, had tried to plead insanity, but Common Pleas Judge Paul Gallagher rejected his request. 

Wong, 51, has been charged with two 
counts of aggravated murder, one count of murder and one count of 
kidnapping, felonious assault and misdemeanor domestic violence.

Crime scene: Wong was found over the body of his wife at their Twinsburg home

Prosecutors claim Wong suspected his wife was having an affair after seeing a bag of candy on her desk on Valentine's Day.

'Everyone in that office has the exact same bag, with the exact same candy in it,' the prosecutor said, adding that it was a gift to all the staff from a colleague.

The couple had been married since 2001 but prosecutors claimed Mrs Wong had been unhappy and talked to a friend about getting a divorce.

On the morning that she died, the couple's two children, aged 10 and seven, were playing in a room next to the master bedroom when they heard their parents arguing.

A 911 call made at 7.06am by the daughter was played to the jury, in which the girl can be heard panicking.

'My daddy’s murdering my mom. I don’t know what’s happening,' she told the dispatcher, before adding: 'He has a knife, he has a knife, he has a knife.'

At 7.11am, armed police arrived at the couple's Twinsburg home and found Wong on top of his wife.

As the couple's children, who testified via video link from a separate court room, described what they saw and heard on the morning of the killing, their father broke down and wept.

His daughter told the court she saw her father walk into the kitchen and return to the bedroom, where she heard 'my mom screaming ... "Call 911".'

She added: 'I went to go to my parents' bedroom to get the cordless phone on a night stand. He was on top of my mom and it was … weird.'

The couple's young son also witnessed the attack, and told the court he had been standing in the doorway to the bedroom at the time.

'My mom started to scream. He was on top of her. That was it,' he said.

Wong's attorney, Brian Pierce, has said his client was responsible for his wife's death, but reminded the court they must determine what he was actually guilty of.

His charges allow for two theories: that the killing was planned and calculated, or that he purposely caused her death during a kidnapping.

'I don't think the state will be able to prove to you that this was a premeditated event,' Mr Pierce said, according to the Twinsburg Bulletin. 'This was impulsive, spur of the moment … and frankly, not very rational.'
