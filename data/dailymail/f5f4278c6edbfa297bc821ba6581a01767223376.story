Sam Tomkins said he is in no doubt that impressive Wigan youngster Joe Burgess would flourish if he followed his lead and moved Down Under.

Several NRL clubs in Australia are interested in signing the 19-year-old who has enjoyed a breakthrough season for Wigan since making his debut in February.

The 6ft 4in winger has impressed with his speed and finishing, scoring four tries on his Challenge Cup debut.

Tomkins was a studio guest on Sky Sports’ coverage of the Grand Final. He joined New Zealand’s Auckland Warriors after winning last season’s showpiece and has been impressed with Burgess, who came up through Wigan’s academy system.

‘When I was at Wigan he came up training with the first team a few times and I remember a kick across to the corner to Pat Richards,’ said Tomkins, who joined an exodus of Super League players to the lucrative NRL. 

‘Pat’s known for being pretty good in the air and Joe would jump above him and take the ball. That’s the first time I thought he might be able to do something.

‘I’ve no doubt he’d be a success in the NRL, but he’s not even played a full season yet in the Super League so I can’t say when the right time to leave, or not, is.’
