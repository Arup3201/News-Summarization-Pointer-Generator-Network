A small but significant turn of the wheel will take Susie Wolff out of the Williams garage on Friday morning at Silverstone, but on a journey to where?

The 31-year-old Scot will become the first woman to drive at a grand prix for 22 years, since Giovanna Amati failed to qualify for the Brazilian Grand Prix on April 4, 1992.

Only five women have taken part in a race weekend in Formula One history compared to 822 men. Only two have started a race: Maria Teresa de Filippis and Lella Lombardi, in the Fifties and Seventies respectively.

Breaking the norm: Wolff is the first woman in 22 years to take part in F1 practice

So, in the eyes of many, Wolff  driving in practice for an hour and a half on Friday and at the German Grand Prix in a fortnight represents a welcome development.

As Wolff said: ‘If there were just a handful of little girls who saw me driving and suddenly realised they could do the same, that would be the biggest positive to come out of it. It’s not a man’s world any more. It just needs to be shown that women can compete at this level and then you’ll get more and more entering.’

That sounds a noble sentiment, but her participation is controversial. Many paddocks observers view it as a stunt. They point to the fact that Wolff has not won a single race in a car, as opposed to a kart, and has not raced at all since the end of the 2012 German touring car series. Her best finish in seven years there was ninth. Her season positions were: 17th, 20th, 18th, 16th, 13th and two unclassified.

Critics point to the fact she is the wife of Toto Wolff, the Mercedes boss who holds a 10 per cent share in Williams. His influence, combined with commercial  reasons, are alleged to be at the heart of the matter.

John Watson, who won the 1980 British Grand Prix, is decidedly unimpressed by her replacing race driver Valtteri Bottas, saying: ‘I wish her well but I don’t see the purpose of her doing practice.

‘She took part in the test after Bahrain this year and did well. But there’s a difference doing this at Silverstone and Hockenheim on race weekends. Suddenly the people out there with her are contesting a world championship.

‘She is not the nominated third driver — Felipe Nasr is — so why do this? It might be nice to put on her c.v. but no F1 team is going to take on a driver in their 30s who hasn’t raced in two years.

‘There is a lack of testing availability and this seems a strange way to use precious time.’

Maria Teresa de Filippis: Drove for Maserati in 1958 Belgian GP and finished 10th. Two more F1 races.

Lella Lombardi: Italian holds the women’s record with 12 starts between 1974 and 1976. First woman to score points in 1975 Spanish Grand Prix.

Desire Wilson: South African was only woman to win an F1 race when triumphing at Brands Hatch in the British Aurora F1 series in 1980.

Giovanna Amati: Last woman to enter F1, she signed for Brabham in 1992 but failed to qualify for the starting grid in three attempts.

Watson speaks for those who feel the hype has run away with itself. That impression was reinforced by a film made about Wolff being entitled Driven: The Fastest Woman in the World. It was a  documentary made by David Stoddart, her brother. But Wolff said: ‘I am well aware there are always going to be those for you and against you. But my husband is not in the car changing gear for me. When I leave that pit lane, I’m on my own.

‘Nobody says Nico Rosberg is only in F1 because his dad was a famous racing driver who funded his karting career and helped him get into F1. It’s unfair just to focus on the fact my husband is in F1 and it’s the only reason I’m in an F1 car.

‘What many people don’t realise is the first F1 test I was offered by Frank Williams and the team was a one-off. It was never planned that I would become part of the team or it would lead to more. But each step, each test went well and it meant the next stage came. If I wasn’t doing a good enough job out on the track or in the  simulator, I wouldn’t be in the team any more.’

That is the belief of Claire Williams, deputy principal of the eponymous team and herself the second highest-ranking woman in the sport behind Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn.

‘When you are running a team the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your race car is talent and that comes with speed, technical feedback, the whole package,’ said Williams.

‘Whether you are a boy or a  girl, it doesn’t make a difference. No-one cares about that.’
