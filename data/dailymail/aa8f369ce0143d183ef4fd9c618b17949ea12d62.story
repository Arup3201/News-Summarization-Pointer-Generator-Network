Security order: David Cameron has put SAS troops on standby following last week's Paris horror

SAS troops will be deployed on the streets if Islamist fanatics launch a Paris-style gun attack in Britain.

David Cameron has put them on standby to head off the ‘fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence’.

The elite soldiers will take part in training exercises in which firearms police will re-create the horror witnessed in France last week.

A defence source said: ‘Special forces will be involved in re-enacting the Paris attack because they are the ones who will be deployed immediately should there be a terror threat.

‘They are always on standby but if there is an attack, armed police and the SAS will be ready. Who would you want swooping in through a window rescuing you from a terror attack? You would want special forces – and that is who would come.’

Ministers and officials never confirm the involvement of the SAS in operations. 

However, there has been speculation the military helped the police respond to the 2005 attacks in London on July 7 and the failed plot of July 21.

As well as expertise in specialist weapons and hostage-rescue, SAS units can be used for surveillance operations or for ‘spotting’ suspects. 

Security officials believe this could be crucial in the immediate aftermath of an atrocity.

In Paris, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi managed to escape the scene of the Charlie Hebdo magazine shooting, where they killed 12. 

While they were being hunted by hundreds of police, fellow fanatic Amedy Coulibaly took customers and staff hostage at a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing four.

Shift in position: On Sunday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he did not think an attack was ‘likely’ but yesterday urged parents to look out for signs of children being radicalised

Police will also be asked to carry out contingency planning on how to track down suspects who flee after a mass-shooting.

Meanwhile the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appears to have shifted position on the terror threat.

On Sunday, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he did not think an attack was ‘likely’, despite the head of MI5 warning of an increasingly complex threat and that not every plot could be stopped.

But yesterday the police chief said officers had worked with the intelligence services to foil several plots in London over the past few months, and ‘the drumbeat of terror had intensified’.

He also urged parents to look out for signs of their children being radicalised or preparing to travel overseas to fight.

Sir Bernard said: ‘You may be worried about talking to the police or the security services but surely it’s got to better if you’re worried about your child going to a horrible place where they get killed or get involved in a crime.’

Meanwhile Professor Michael Clarke, of the RUSI defence think-tank, said he expected terrorists to try attacks similar to the ones in Paris. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘This fashion not so much to attack aircraft and airports but to go for marauding attacks is likely to increase.’
