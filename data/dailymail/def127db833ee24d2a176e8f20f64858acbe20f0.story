She gamely took part in the Olympics Opening Ceremony, pretending to leap out of a plane and land in the middle of the festivities.

He praised her for her wonderful sense of humour and down to earth attitude.

But it would appear that despite this, director Danny Boyle still thinks the Queen should not head of state - and calls for an elected figure instead.

The Oscar winner says Queen Elizabeth was 'fantastic' at the Olympics, but says the royal family is under 'impossible pressure'

The Oscar-winning director and creator of the dazzling ceremony suggested that JK Rowling would be a successor, the Guardian reported.

In an interview he calls for a republic, saying that a US-style elected head is inevitable and he thinks that the royal family will be abolished in his lifetime.

He says the royal family has 'utterly impossible' pressure put on them.

He told the Guardian: 'It's a ludicrous spotlight they're under.

'You can still have a royal family if you like ... but actually have an elected head of state.'

He says that the system used in America to elect a head of state is 'healthy' and hopes it will be introduced in the UK.

But it's clear he admired the Queen for her approach to the Olympics.

The Queen and Daniel Craig joined in the joke for London's Olympic Opening Ceremony - and her Majesty was praised by Danny Boyle for being 'very sharp'

Despite her starring role, Boyle says that a republic is 'inevitable' and that the American system seems 'healthy'

She performed in a short film alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond, greeting him at Buckingham Palace before pretending to go with him into a helicopter, push him out and then sky dive herself.

Boyle told the Guardian that he had only asked permission from the royal family for the joke, band was stunned when her Majesty asked to take part.

He said she nailed the cameo in one shot, was down to earth and was patient.

Praising her, the 56-year-old said: 'She's very sharp, she was fantastic.'

Previously, he described the Queen as having the 'instincts of a performer', and she clearly appreciated the paramount need for secrecy – even with the rest of the Royals.

A performer played the role of Queen Elizabeth parachuting - and Boyle praised the monarch for being 'fantastic'

'She showed great instinct again when she decided that no one in her family should know about the film, so that it was as much a surprise and delight for them as for the nation.'

But even his good impression of the Queen and his patriotic display at the London Games cannot persuade Boyle to change his republican roots.

For Boyle, it was a more a case of wanting to be an equal citizen.

'People fought many battles to make everybody free, equal citizens.

'I have no reason to believe that being a preferred subject would have any value that could improve the pride I feel in being an equal citizen.

'I'm lucky because I've made money and people like the work I've done but it doesn’t make me feel I'm better than anyone.

'You've got to be careful because it sounds like you're criticising other people who have accepted knighthoods, which I'm not doing at all.

'It's a very personal choice.'
