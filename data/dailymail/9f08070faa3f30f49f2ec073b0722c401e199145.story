A London penthouse is believed to be the most expensive rental property in the country after it was put on the market for £2.3m a year.

The five-bedroom, five-bathroom apartment is located in the exclusive One Hyde Park - the most expensive block of flats in the world. It boasts five reception rooms, parking for two cars and panoramic views across the capital.

A private landlord has put the flat on the rental market for £45,000-a-week or £195,000-a-month. That means a Briton on the average annual wage of £26,500 could stay for just three days in the stunning apartment before blowing their entire annual salary before tax.

Over a 12-month period, any tenant will find themselves spending £2.34 million on rent - enough to buy a nine ‘average’ UK homes priced at £250,000.

This is significantly greater than the £780,000 annual rent asked for by Phones4You billionaire John Caudwell for his Mayfair mansion which appeared in the media last week.

One Hyde Park was built by billionaires Nick and Christian Candy. A number of the world’s wealthiest people have owned flats at the building in the past - including Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, former Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar.

A similar decor is featured throughout the apartment - including in one of five living areas, pictured, which comes with several luxurious sofas

Even the hallway in the £200,000-a- month rental is expansive and features numerous pieces of art as well as extravagant light fittings

Another of the bedrooms - which is so large, it even has its own living room and seating area in it. An average salary of £26,500 would buy you three days in the flat

A more modest 'snug' room, where the soon-to-be occupant could perhaps enjoy watching a film on the widescreen television
