Millions of rail passengers are to be offered free superfast wifi access on the busiest commuter routes.

A fine imposed on Network Rail for missing punctuality targets will be used to equip trains into London, Manchester, Brighton, Portsmouth, Bedford and Leeds with mobile broadband.

Ministers say they want to help commuters fed-up with signals dropping out and encourage more people to travel by train because they can work at the same time.

Internet access on the rail network remains patchy, with people on some of the most popular routes forced to rely on their mobile phone signal to check emails, browse the internet or catch up on Facebook and Twitter.

The Department for Transport said the £90million investment would ‘radically improve’ broadband access on the railways.

Ministers are using money from a fine due to be imposed on Network Rail by the Office of Rail Regulation for missing punctuality targets.

The project will begin immediately, and it is hoped to complete before the end of an upgrade of tracks by 2017.

Train carriages will be fitted out with new wifi equipment, with the promise of ‘seamless mobile broadband connections’.

Internet speeds and bandwidth will be similar to what people expect off the railways and at least 10 times better than services that they currently experience today, officials claim.

Key routes due to benefit include routes into London from Bedford, Brighton, Kent and Portsmouth as well as services into Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.

Crucially, the government expects access will be free, in contrast to other lines where passengers are charged by the hour.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘We all know how frustrating it can be to have our phonecalls and internet use constantly disrupted by poor signal while travelling on trains. At the moment it happens too often.

‘Passengers expect and deserve better and with these plans, that is what they’ll get.’

The project is expected to cost £90million, and it will be the first time a fine from Network Rail has been used to directly improve services for passengers in this way.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said too often passengers have journeys disrupted by poor phone and web acess

Lib Dem transport minister Baroness Kramer said: 'The coalition government is working hard to build a stronger economy and fairer society.

'Today's announcement that we are providing free wifi on trains means people can more easily work and keep up with friends while on journeys.

'As well as steps we have already taken to make train travel as affordable and efficient as possible we hope free wifi will encourage even more people to make the greener choice and travel by train.’
