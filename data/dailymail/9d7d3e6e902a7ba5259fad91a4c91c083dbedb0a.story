Chelsea will line up in their Premier League title showdown with Manchester City on Saturday night without two of their key players in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.

In a double blow for Jose Mourinho, Costa has been banned for three games for his stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final, while Fabregas is struggling with the hamstring injury that forced his early withdrawal from the same match.

Their absence will undoubtedly be a major boost to City as they attempt to close the gap from five to two points - but just how important have the pair been for Chelsea this season?

Chelsea player involvement in goals 2014-2015

They have been involved in Chelsea's goals on a frequent basis - Costa has contributed 17 goals and two assists in the Premier League, while Fabregas has scored twice and registered an astonishing 15 assists.

It means the Spain striker has been involved in 37 per cent of Chelsea's league goals this term, while the Spanish midfielder has played a hand in 33 per cent.

Fabregas remains well on course to eclipse Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists in a Premier League campaign, set during the 2002-03 season, and a good proportion of them have been to Costa's benefit.

There is a noticeable slump in Chelsea's form when Costa is not in the side - although it is not dramatic enough to suggest they are over-reliant on him.

He has only been absent from three of Chelsea's 22 league matches but their win percentage does dip from 73.7 per cent to 66.7 per cent in his absence and the average number of goals drops from 2.4 to 2.

Fabregas has missed just one league match to date, the home match with Hull City in mid-December through an accumulation of yellow cards, and they weren't adversely affected, winning 2-0.

This is, however, is the first league game in which both Fabregas and Costa have been absent and it's rotten luck for Mourinho that it comes in the most important game of the season so far.

Didier Drogba is expected to take Costa's place in attack and the Ivorian has five goals in 14 career outings against City, the Blues winning nine of those meetings.

Jose Mourinho's team can open up a mammoth eight-point gap at the top with a win over Man City

A win will see Chelsea extend their advantage to a surely-insurmountable eight points and all the omens are in their favour.

No team has beaten City more often in the Premier League era than Chelsea, with 22 wins to their name.

Chelsea have won 11 and lost just one of the last 16 Premier League meetings against City and Mourinho has won seven and lost just two of his 11 meetings against Manuel Pellegrini.
