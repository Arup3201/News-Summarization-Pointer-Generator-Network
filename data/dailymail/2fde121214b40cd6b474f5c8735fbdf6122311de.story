Manchester United are prepared to offer Real Madrid £120million to entice the La Liga giants into selling Gareth Bale, according to reports in Spain.

Spanish expert Guillem Balague believes Louis van Gaal is keen on bringing the Welshman back to the Premier League and is willing to smash the world transfer record.

United were interested in Bale when the 25-year-old was intent on leaving Tottenham in 2013, however they lost out to Real Madrid in the race to sign the Wales winger.

The world's most expensive player is said to be happy with life in the Spanish capital but that has apparently not deterred Van Gaal from declaring his interest in the Real Madrid superstar.

Van Gaal would have a realistic chance of signing Bale if Real Madrid fans had their way. AS have ran an open poll in which just under 54 per cent responded by saying they would cash in on the Welshman if Manchester United made a substantial offer.  

Bale's Real Madrid team-mate Iker Casillas has reiterated his desire to prolong his stay at the Bernabeu.

The Spanish goalkeeper has stated he 'has no reason to leave' after winning back his place under Carlo Ancelotti.
