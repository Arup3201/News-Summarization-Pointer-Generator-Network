Before you fill your holiday bag with your usual essentials, why not stock up on these foreign beauty steals instead? 

If you can’t wait to snap up one of these cult products, you can purchase them online, but they’re cheaper to buy in their home countries.

Plus, you’ll avoid those overseas shipping costs, giving you more cash for cocktails by the pool.

Bargain: Scour pharmacies and beauty boutiques abroad for brilliant cosmetic treats that cost pennies

FRANCE

Mustela’s lait de toilette is used by French mothers when changing a baby’s nappy  and is popular as a gentle cleansing milk thanks to being hypoallergenic and free of chemical nasties (£7.49, blisspharmacy.co.uk or €4.90/£4.20 in France). 

Cinq Mondes, a leading French spa company, also has a fantastic range. The Mousse Lait de Fleurs (£22.60, cinqmondes.com or €24/£20 in France) uses the softening properties of tropical flowers to cleanse and tighten skin pores.

ITALY

British make-up artists always head straight for the beauty counter at Milan airport to stock up on Kiko products. 

A best seller is the Full Coverage Concealer (£7.50, kikocosmetics.co.uk or €5.90/£5 in Italy), which gives effective coverage and doesn’t sit in creases.

The Eye Base Primer comes in a tiny tube and helps eye make-up stay put (£6.90 or €6.90/£5.90 in Italy).

Good stuff: African Botanics Stretchmark Botanical Body Balm and Kiko Full Coverage Concealer

GREECE

Need suncream? Snap up the SPF 25 BB face cream from the indigenous Carroten range (prices start at £4.50, carroten.gr or  €4/£3.40 in Greece). 

Another brand favoured by Athenian fashionistas is the yoghurt skin care range by Korres, which applies all the goodness of live yoghurt, rich in lactic acid, direct to your skin. 

The Yoghurt Body and Face Suncreen is cooling, rehydrating and contains no chemical nasties (£16.40, beautyexpert.co.uk or €12/£10.30 in country). 

IRELAND

Created by marine scientist Patrick Mulrooney, a passionate believer in the power of the sea, Seavite is a beauty range made from organic Irish Atlantic seaweed. 

Now run by Mulrooney’s daughters — both of whom are doctors — the range is suitable for sensitive skin. 

The Organic Seaweed Face Cream combines anti-ageing and  UV protection with intensive moisture (£25.80, seavite.ie, or €27.60/£23  in Ireland). 

Brilliant: Greece is where you'll find Carroten's excellent sunscreen range so stock up for next year's trip now

All natural: Australia's botanical beauty line A'kin costs a fraction of the price when picked up Down Under

Brazilian beauty: The citizens of Rio know how to deal with sun which is why Sol de Janeiro's cooling coconut aftersun water is so brilliant

BRAZIL

Sol de Janeiro is the suncare brand to be seen with when you’re hanging out with  the body beautiful on Brazil’s glitzy beaches. 

The Coconut Water Cooling Aftersun Gel smells like a cocktail and is just as refreshing (£17,  nivenandjoshua.com or 26 Brazilian real/£7.60). Meanwhile, the Starfruit Sunscreen Spray, (£24 or 39 Brazilian real/£11.40) promotes a golden tan while blocking  out harmful UVA and UVB rays and is fragranced with essential oils to soothe skin irritated by sun and heat.

SOUTH AFRICA

The key ingredient in the African Botanics range is marula oil, a botanical extract that is mineral rich and a  powerful antioxidant. 

The Stretchmark Botanical Body Balm (£40, spacenk.com or 543 South African rand/£36) is  brilliant for fading stretch  marks and scars, while the Neroli infused Marula Oil (£64 or 690 rand/£45) is a good daily skin conditioning treatment. 

The range puts the country’s rich natural resources to good use —harnessing the power of green rooibos tea extract, Cape camomile, baoba oil and helichrysum, a flower that grows wild without using parabens. 

AUSTRALIA

The Antipodeans know a thing or two about beauty and there’s a hidden gem called A’Kin to be found in Australia’s local health food stores, which is silicone, paraben and cruelty free. 

Boots stock a limited range including Ginkgo and Chamomile Revitalising Eye Night Creme (£18.99, boots.com or $25 AU/£15).
