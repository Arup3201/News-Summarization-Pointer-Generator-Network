An explosive Geoffrey Edelsten has hit back at claims made by the American woman who revealed intimate details of their brief relationship by calling her a 'fat, ugly liar.'

The 71-year-old told his version of events on Channel Nine's A Current Affair on Tuesday night - the same program 21-year-old American Shirley Moore appeared on a night before to air damming allegations about him.

Mr Edelsten refuted all but one claim made by Ms Moore - that they met on a 'sugar daddy' website - by stating that she 'told  Australia a whole lot of lies' when she spoke of bribes, possible marriage and payments he made to her during their  time together.

He also said Ms Moore broke a legally binding agreement to delete emails she gained access to which she said contained information about Mr Edelsten's many lovers.

A fuming Mr Edelsten said: 'She appeared on your program with a whole lot of lies.'

'She is ugly, she is fat, a gold digger with no morals and she is dangerous.'  

Mr Edelsten said he never made a 'verbal agreement' with Ms Moore about their paid-for relationship, nor did he buy her a BMW to keep her quiet about emails which allegedly revealed he was cheating on her.

Speaking on the program, he said money was only a 'minor' attraction of what women see in him and that his relationships with women are anything but 'business transactions.'

Mr Edelsten was happy to hear that his fiancée Gabi Grecko was supporting him after Monday's program

He said the  Ms Moore's appearance on the program was financially motivated.

'The whole reason she has done this is to cause me harm and to make money.'

He also said there was never a proposal contract made between him and former lover Brynne Gordon, also known as Brynne Edelsten - which Ms Moore claimed was worth $50 million.

'There was never a contract with Brynne.'

'There were private emails - but I don't recall $50 million ever being mentioned.'

He said despite Ms Moore seeing all his emails - she has 'made up stories' about the 'document' which is alleged to have contained  details of the agreed proposal.

Claims that Ms Moore made about the money she was afforded, starting at $8,000 a month or $96,000 a year to be in a relationship with him, he said were also false.

One element of the interview Mr Edelsten was happy to hear was that his fiancée Gabbi Grecko was supporting him.

Gabi Grecko  hit back on social media after her fiancé exposed her 'paid for' relationship with the septuagenarian businessman.

Gabi, 25, took to Instagram in the early hours of Tuesday morning to upload a series of images, illustrating her turmoil.

Mr Edelsten said he wasn't aware that she had been supportive of him, but spoke with her on Tuesday where he said he would out Ms Moore as a liar.

'I said that I would make it clear that if I did an interview with A Current Affair that what a horrible person she is , that she is ugly, she is fat and that her activities in trying to abuse and stalk other people close to me is just not acceptable'

I got to be blunt - I'm facing a girl who told a whole lot of Australia a whole lot of lies.'

Hitting back: Gabi Grecko took to social media to vent her feelings after her fiancé Geoffrey Edelsten's ex-secret lover Shirley Moore exposed her 'paid for' relationship with the 71-year-old businessman 

Gabi Grecko pictured parting shots onto Instagram of Ms Moore sitting on a park bench, exposing a length of leg, beside which Gabi wrote: 'WTF'. 

Hours later the Maxim model posted a series of hilariously captioned film stills from an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Larry David propositions a female prostitute and offers to pay her to attend a Dodgers game with him.

In the comic television sequence the pair argue over the amount of money she should receive for the entirety of the game - Gabi appeared to be drawing similarities between her situation and the fictional characters.

One caption read 'At the Brownlow' presumably alluding to the fact that Geoffrey and Ms Moore had reportedly ended their relationship after she failed to attend the lauded event by his side.

In another shot where the couple are in driving in a car, Gabi wrote 'Can you drive this BMW?' referring to Ms Moore's claims that Mr Edelsten gifted her with a vehicle to keep her quiet.

At 21, Ms Moore, a waitress from Chicago, claims she became one of 71-year-old Edelsten's kept women after meeting the Australian businessman on a sugar daddy website.

Exposing the details her lavish relationship with the former general practitioner on Monday night's ACA, Ms Moore says the Australian - who was then three times her age - paid her a monthly allowance that grew from $8,000 to $250,000 over the course of their relationship.

Revealing: Ms Moore claimed she met Edelsten at the age of 21 on a sugar daddy website during her interview on Monday Night's A Current Affair 

She told Channel Nine's ACA she had a 'verbal agreement' with Mr Edelsten about the nature of their relationship, which she says was 'purely business' and that she did not love him.

The busty brunette says she went on the show because the public deserve to know the truth about the businessmen's multiple relationships, revealing that  the pair even discussed marriage.

However, it was at that point that she unearthed email exchanges between Geoffrey and other women, but after threatening to go public with their arrangement when she found the emails, she says she was gifted with a BMW.

Shortly after the pair split and Ms Moore was outed for another 'sugarbaby' - Brynne Gordon formerly Brynne Edelsten - who Ms Moore claims he met online and offered a $50 million proposal, including an engagement ring worth at least $250,000.

Reality TV star Ms Edelsten has previously denied meeting her ex-husband - who is now dating New York model Gabi Grecko - online. 

Ms Moore contacted Ms Grecko soon after her relationship with the businessman began when he claimed they were just friends and exchanged words.

'I emailed her: "Who are you to Geoffrey?",' she said.

'The first email that she sent me was: "Go away you dumb b****. He's mine, we're getting engaged.'

Ms Moore said she emailed Ms Grecko because she and Mr Edelsten had been in contact with each other and they had planned to meet up.

In love: Beauty queen Gabi shared an image of an engagement ring on Friday, perhaps hinting at things to come 

Ms Moore will now take the stand to give evidence in the 71-year-old Edelsten's bankruptcy proceedings in the US. 

A lawsuit has been launched in an effort to reclaim millions of dollars from the former millionaire  in order to repay his huge debts in the US.

Twice-married Geoffrey split with his estranged second wife of four years Brynne late last year amid rumours that he'd cheated on her. 

In March he went public with his relationship with Gabi after the couple met in New York. 

They announced their engagement in July with Gabi sharing an image of a stunning 2.11 carat Classic Winston engagement ring on social media on Friday.

The pair, who have yet to set a date, are expected to marry in 2015.
