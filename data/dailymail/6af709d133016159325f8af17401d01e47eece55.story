House Speaker John Boehner's lawsuit against him is just a 'stunt,' President Barack Obama told ABC News anchor George Stephanopolous on Thursday.

Obama said he'd already talked to the GOP legislator and that he told him,‘ "If you’re really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why don’t you try getting something done through Congress?" '

'You're going to squawk if I try to fix some parts of it 
administratively that are within my authority while you're not doing 
anything?' Obama said, referring to House Republicans.

"I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they're doing nothing.'

Obama
 has repeatedly touted his 'pen and phone' approach to implementing his domestic 
agenda by going around Congress, casting 2014 during his most recent 
State of the Union address as a 'year of action.'

The House has passed legislation that 
would curb the president's power to take executive actions that 
Republicans say fall outside his constitutional authority, but Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid has declared them dead on arrival.

On Wednesday Boehner announced he will file a lawsuit against President Obama for what 
he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the
 federal government.

'This is not about impeachment,' the Ohio legislator insisted. 'It's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country.'

'What
 we've seen, clearly over the last five years, is an effort to erode the
 power of the legislative branch,' Boehner said. 'I believe the 
president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country.'

Obama's more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts, ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his Obamacare law, decreeing new fuel-economy standards for trucks, and – most recently – declaring that the EPA will enforce a wide-ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions.

Obama's Climate Action Plan, formalized this week, is being called a 'coal-killer' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal-fired electric power plants.

But most objectionable to conservatives in Boehner's caucus, according to multiple Capitol Hill sources, is the president's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

That move, Republicans say, led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the U.S.-Mexico border in the hope of an amnesty.

Boehner 
told reporters on Wednesday that he hasn't yet decided which of Obama's 
executive actions he will challenge in federal court.

'When I make that decision, I'll let you know,' he said.

He told a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo
 – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks. The
 whole House of Representatives would be the plaintiff, meaning he will 
need the approval of House leaders.

With the GOP in the majority, that isn't expected to be a problem.

The
 Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, an informal House leadership panel, 
will likely make the call. It includes Boehner, newly minted Majority 
Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Minority Leader 
Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. A simple majority vote, 
likely 3-2, will determine if Boehner can proceed.

Asked in his weekly press briefing on Wednesday if he's committed to moving forward, he replied, 'I am.'

'You notice that he didn't specifically
 say what exactly he was objecting to,' Obama said when asked 
about the suit by Stephanopoulos.

'Right now we’ve got a Republican Party that seems to only care about saying "no" to me.'

Fox News host Neil Cavuto, an unlikely ally of the Obama administration, bemoaned the GOP's latest move as partisan politics on his show Wednesday afternoon.

'Where was your rage when Democrats were going after President Bush on the same use of executive orders?' Cavuto asked Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.

'I think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now. There are far more important things you guys have to be addressing.'

Bachmann apparently didn't get her caucus leader's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president.

'What we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option,' Bachmann said. 'What we can do further is impeach the elected official.'

'Think about what you are saying,' Cavuto told her during the shouting match. 'The Democrats would be in their right mind to laugh you out.'

Boehner said he hasn't yet decided exactly which of Obama's executive actions he will challenge in court

White 
House press secretary Josh Earnest accused congressional Republicans of 
obstruction on Wednesday, and said they had left Obama with little 
option but to make greater use of his executive authority

'The
 fact that they are considering a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the 
President of the United States for doing his job, I think, is the kind 
of step that most Americans wouldn't support,' Earnest said.

'This lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the White House.'

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel pushed back on the Obama administration on Friday, telling reporters via email, 'The American people, their elected representatives, and the Supreme 
Court have all expressed serious concerns about the President’s failure 
to follow the Constitution.'

'Dismissing them with words like, "smidgen" 
or "stunt’" only reinforces their frustration,' he said.

Obama 'has a clear record of ignoring the American people’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority, which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy,' he told Roll Call earlier this week.
