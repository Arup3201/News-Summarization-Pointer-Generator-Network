Hard times: Victoria Hartfield had to give up her job following a bout of ill-health

A woman who has been living in a horse box for five years after falling on hard times is facing eviction after residents complained to the council.

Victoria Hartfield moved into the green van after ill-health forced to sell her Bristol home in 2003.

The 50-year-old had to give up her job as a university researcher and she bought the Â£10,000 horse box to keep a roof over her head.

She moved on to piece of common ground at Cleeve Common, north Somerset in 2007 - a location which is currently being used as a car park.

In response to pressure from local residents, Cleeve Parish Council has tried to move Miss Hartfield on a number of occasions - despite the fact the authority does not own the land.

Residents claimed the van caused congestion and raised concerns about the lack of sanitation and waste disposal facilities at the site.

However no one could be prosecuted for failing to comply with enforcement action because there was no identifiable owner of the land.

The council now plans to use powers under the Common Act of 2006 to evict Miss Hartfield, who suffers from chronic fatigue, from the site.

But Miss Hartfield says if the council presses ahead with the eviction it will force her to lead a nomadic lifestyle, moving from site to site until she finds somewhere else to settle.

Unemployed Miss Hartfield said: 'The initial plan was to buy the horsebox, get some work and try to get back on my feet.

'I did find a site before I came here and contacted the council but they never replied so I parked up in Cleeve.

'I can't afford to tun a house, so I provided my own accommodation and the council has come up with no other viable sites.

'I want to stay in north Somerset as I have a support network and friends here. There are lots of landowners that would be happy to accommodate me, But I won't go in case they get into trouble with the council.'

Her horsebox has no electric link up, no mains water supply and no toilet.

But it does have a shower and cooking facilities and a system to heat water which she buys in.

Miss Hartfield, who is a volunteer with the NHS, said: 'The majority of local people don't see a problem with me being here.'

There are 42 residential traveller pitches in six locations across north Somerset at the moment.

However there are no transit pitches, although the council is planning more.

Cleeve Parish Council clerk Gemma Richards said: 'This land is for the enjoyment of all local residents and villagers have attended meetings on a number of occasions to complain about the encampment and the fact it is not an appropriate place for anyone to live.'

North Somerset Council said it had contacted Miss Hartfield in the past and offered her support and advice to seek alternative housing.

The authority intends to serve an order asking her to leave the site and if she fails to comply it can apply to the magistrates court for an order allowing it to take steps to ensure the land is vacated.
