Pressure: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is mounting pressure on Falklands as her nation asks for more loans

Argentina is to set to demand £1.8 billion in loans from the World Bank, just days after the Daily Mail revealed British taxpayers were sending the country £2 million in foreign aid.

Campaigners are urging the UK government to turn Argentina down for more loans after its leader Cristina Kirchner threatened to arrest oil explorers in the Falklands.

Argentina's increasingly aggressive claims on the Falklands have alarmed British MPs.

The UK abstained in a vote when Argentina asked for a loan from the World Bank last year.

But there are fears that ministers may cave in under international pressure if Argentina strikes a less belligerent tone.

Jonathan Isaby, the chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'As the Argentine Government comes knocking on the World Bank's door again, International Development Secretary Justine Greening must remain resolute and actively oppose any new loans.'

He added: 'With the administration in Buenos Aires making repeated attacks on British interests and refusing to abide by its international obligations, it would be totally unacceptable for UK taxpayers' money to be used to underwrite further loans to Argentina.

'Ministers tell us that the Department for International Development will work "in our national interest" and this is exactly the kind of issue where their actions must reflect those words.'

It is more than a decade since Argentina was forced to default over soaring debts, and the debilitating effects still linger.

The nation is struggling to re-enter the global market - and still harbours around $9billion in debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations.

It was on the brink of becoming an economic super power throughout the 90s after pegging the value of the peso to US dollars - but the government failed to address their growing debt crisis, which reached a climax in 2000.

With more than half the population living below the poverty line, the IMF approved a $14million loan but it was too late.

President de la Rúa resigned, prompting a string of four presidents in 10 days, before President Duhalde declared the currency devalued.

Protest: Campaigners are urging ministers to block the loan after Kirchner threatened to arrest oil explorers on the British island

Since 2003, under Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the economy has grown more than eight per cent.

However, British taxpayers sent £2 million to the country in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office, despite increasingly hostility between the two countries.

A small amount of cash was also provided by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which is owned by the Department for International Development and which invests in companies in developing countries.

Britain also sends around £7 million to the £50 million EU aid programme to Argentina and millions more through huge loans to the World Bank.
