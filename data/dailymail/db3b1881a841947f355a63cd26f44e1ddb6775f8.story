Nurses at a scandal-hit NHS hospital are being investigated by police for allegedly drugging elderly and difficult patients to enjoy a quiet night shift.

The issue was raised after Gareth Williams was told by nurses that patients on his mother's ward at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales were being given powerful sedatives without prescription.

Mr Williams was told what was happening by a whistleblowing nurse before the death of his 82-year-old mother Lillian Williams. It has already been admitted in her case during Protection of Vulnerable Adults investigation into her death.

Mrs Williams, a mother-of-five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board.

An investigation has been launched at the Princess of Wales Hospital into claims that nurses drugged elderly and vulnerable patients without prescription or consent in order to make sure they had an 'easy night shift'

In the wake of her case, police have referred criminal charges against nurses at the hospital for allegedly giving sedatives to vulnerable patients without prescription or consent.

Mr Williams said: 'A nurse told me she had witnessed patients regularly being given unnecessary sedation without prescription at night to make life easier for the night shift team.

'I told nurses I had been promised by my mother's doctor she would not be sedated without consent or prescription. 

'They said it is alright for them to promise the impossible and then walk off but we have to cope with them all night.

'A nurse told us many of the people being sedated are very ill and very frail and if you give them the wrong drug it could kill them.'

The hospital is already at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect.

Richard Baker, a barrister who represented families at the inquiry into appalling care and high death rates at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, said that using drugs without the consent of patients so staff could have a quiet night would be inappropriate.

He said: 'The use of drugs inappropriately, in patients who could not offer consent would also be wrong. Administering medication to sedate patients so that staff could have a quiet night would be an inappropriate use of that medication.

'Both would be gross breaches of nursing and clinical standards and would likely lead to disciplinary action.

'As to seriousness, it would evidently have the potential to end the careers of the people involved.'

The allegations came to light after a nurse told Gareth Williams his mother Lillian Williams, 82, was one of a number of patients being given powerful sedatives without consent or prescription at the hospital 

Mr Williams said the nurse said she'd seen patients on his mother's ward given drugs without prescription

Welsh Assembly Member Bethan Jenkins has written to Ed Beltrami, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in Wales, to ask him to speed up the process of reviewing the evidence and to bring charges. She said police had been investigating since Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) admitted that Mrs Williams was 'sedated unnecessarily without consent'. 

Ms Jenkins, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales West, said a whistleblower nurse working for the health board had approached Mrs Williams' family and told them that 'for years she has witnessed night staff on Ward 6 sedating elderly vulnerable patients without prescription'.

Ms Jenkins said the family had been involved in a 'protracted battle' to get an answer about what happened to their mother. 

She said: 'So naturally they are at a loss to understand why it has taken 16 months for the police to investigate and why there is not yet a decision from the CPS as to whether these admissions of very serious abuses and neglects amount to crimes.

'They believe - as do I - that 16 months is ample time to investigate and come to a decision. Bereaved families need closure, and the delays in this investigation are only putting off that day.'

Helen Rundle, a lawyer leading calls for a public inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Welsh NHS, said a decision on charges by the CPS would be made in the next few weeks.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is investigating complaints regarding the quality of care provided to Lilian Williams whilst she was an in-patient at both The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot Hospital during 2010 and 2012 respectively.

'Whilst the CPS has been in contact with South Wales Police in relation to this aspect of the investigation, we have not been asked to provide formal charging advice. In mid-November, the CPS received a report from South Wales Police seeking observations on their findings and the content of that report is currently under consideration.

'We have recently received correspondence on this matter from elected Assembly Members and representatives of the victim's family. It would be therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further before we have responded directly to these enquiries.'

A spokesman for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were cooperating with the ongoing police investigation, but said it would be inappropriate to comment until it was complete.
