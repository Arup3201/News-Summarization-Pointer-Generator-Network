He has become one of Britain's most feared food critics after TripAdvisor named him their most prolific restaurant reviewer.

Geordie businessman Phil Blackett has racked up 780 
reviews of restaurants, takeaways and hotels, in an impressive 501 
cities spread across 36 counties.

But the burly 52-year-old has revealed there is one chef immune from his critical eye...his girlfriend.

The sunglasses salesman has racked up 780 reviews of restaurants, takeaways and hotels in 501 cities across 36 countries

Touring the length and breadth of Britain for work, the sunglasses salesman meticulously rates every establishment he visits, from Greggs to the country's Michelin-starred restaurants.

The down-to-earth food fan from Newcastle-upon-Tyne is not easily impressed with fancy haute cuisine, often rating fast food outlets above revered establishments.

'I eat out every day, from Greggs to Michelin-starred restaurants and they all get rated by me.

'I have given some of the top restaurants zero stars and the scruffiest of kebab shops high acclaim. I’m not fussy, I just have my standards.'

'I travel the world with my business so there’s always opportunity to eat out,' he said.

'I’ve reviewed everything from kebab vans to posh hotels - although I would never write a review of my girlfriend’s cooking.'

The 52-year-old is not afraid to clash with some of the world's best-known critics, rating the two Michelin-starred Met Restaurant in Venice, Italy just two out of five stars

The father-of-two often rates fast food takeaways higher above revered haute cuisine. He said: 'I eat out every day, from Greggs to Michelin starred restaurants and they all get rated by me'

Mr Blackett blasted Jamie Oliver's 'Jamie's Italian' restaurant in Canary Wharf, London, branding it a 'half decent tourist attraction'

Since starting writing reviews for 
TripAdvisor under the pseudonym Dogsheep in 2008, Mr Blackett has 
reviewed nearly 200 outlets in his home town of Newcastle and posts an 
average of one review a day.

The father-of-two has posted reviews from as far afield as Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Venezuela.

And
according to statistics in his user profile, he has travelled 181,000 
miles in his pursuit of top notch grub, and has travelled 31 per cent of
the world.

Mild-mannered Phil has a list of six pet hates that turn him off any restaurant, and land them with a miserable review. He said:

His hard work paid off and he was 
crowned TripAdvisor’s most prolific UK reviewer of 2012, a feat which he
hopes to repeat this year.

He
said: 'I was sent a huge hamper full of food and I was told I was the 
number one reviewer in the world. It got me thinking, no wonder my waist
line was expanding.

'TripAdvisor were really happy that I took it seriously and appreciated the work that I do. I can think of worse jobs.

'It can’t be good for my health but I am eating out even more. I have put on a couple of stone going for the 2013 prize.

'Even when my missus just wants to make a Greek salad at home, I drag her out to a restaurant.

'I
don’t think restaurant owners and waiting staff ever think I am such a 
prolific reviewer, so I get the treatment everyone else gets.

'If they are polite to a bloke like me then their service has to be five stars.'

The critic, who counts Parisian restaurant La Coupole as his favourite, is not afraid to clash with his world famous peers.

He blasted the two Michelin-starred Met Restaurant in Venice, Italy, rating it a mere two out of five.

'We were very excited to visit this acclaimed Michelin two-starred Italian restaurant for my partner's birthday only to be quite disappointed," he wrote.

'The food was decent enough, service good, ambiance average.

'Some of these European Michelin-starred places are just a little too bland and stuffy whereas in the UK are (sic) Michelin restaurants try a lot harder and tend to be more interesting and funky. Not very happy.'

And Mr Blackett is not shy when it comes to blasting celebrities after branding Jamie Oliver's 'Jamie's Italian' in Canary Wharf, London a 'half decent tourist attraction' rating it three stars overall.

His review says: 'Great service, lovely staff, good quality charcuterie then it ended.

'The wine selection was poor as was our selection; Fritto misto very pooras were all of our pasta dishes.

'We won't go back. Half decent tourist attraction.'

Mr Blackett said his girlfriend is the only chef in the world immune from his critical eye

In a rare five-star review Mr Blackett praises his local Papa John's pizza restaurant in Newcastle

However, the critical food-lover, was quick to sing the praises of fast food pizza takeaway Papa John's in Newcastle.

Giving a rare five-star review, he said: 'We tried all
of the usual suspects Dominoes, Pizza Hut and all of the locals and 
nothing comes near to Papa Johns.

'Fresh quality ingredients, regular 
consistency and excellent customer and delivery service. Try The Works and The Garden Party specials, and you will always return.'

But other outlets in his home town do not rate so favourably.

Of
Santana’s in Newcastle, he wrote: 'I don’t for the life of me know why 
we visited this place.

'My son, daughter in law, granddaughter, daughter 
and me all with our trousers down. Tesco discount pizzas are better.

'Honestly, the service is dreadful and the restaurant is lifeless. Even 
the chairs are too low for the tables.'

And popular American chain TGI Friday's in Newcastle met with a similar level of disdain, not reaching Mr Blackett's exacting standards.

Giving
them a one-star review, he wrote: 'I really don’t know how these places
survive. The food is certainly not fresh probably frozen. The service 
is so artificial.

'These English staff are trained in the American way but can’t pull it off. Poor, poor, plastic and poor.'
