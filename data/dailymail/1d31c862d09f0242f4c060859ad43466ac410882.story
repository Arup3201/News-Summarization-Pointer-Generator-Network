Forced out: Sallie Krawcheck quit her role as head of the wealth management division of Bank of America in September 2011 after a restructuring programme eliminated her role

According to the Huffington Post, she told the audience at a Conference on women in business yesterday: 'I got grateful when I got fired.

'I said "how many people get to get fired and it's on the front page of The Wall Street Journal?'

Following
 her firing, several stories appeared claiming that Ms Krawcheck was a 
huge loss to Wall Street and lamenting the low glass ceiling for women 
in the finance industry.

Her
 focus now is to help other women reach similar positions of prominence 
after recently become an investor at 85 Broads - an organisation which 
helps women further their business careers.

She also claimed that Wall Street 
companies need to allow employees to have a healthier work-life balance 
before the industry can become more diverse.

Ms
 Krawcheck said: 'We went into the downturn with the financial services 
companies white, male and middle-aged and we left with them whiter and 
more middle-aged.'
