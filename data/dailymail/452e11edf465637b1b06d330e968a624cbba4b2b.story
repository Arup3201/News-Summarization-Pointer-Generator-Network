David Rudisha dominated the 800 metres at the London 2012 Olympics like a true champion and he lost the Commonwealth Games final like one, too.

The world record-holder and Olympic champion had only praise for his conqueror Nijel Amos, the Botswanan who won silver behind Rudisha two years ago but sprinted clear of the tall, elegant Kenyan in the straight to win Commonwealth gold in 1min 45.18sec on Thursday night.

Rudisha’s gallantry in defeat was reciprocated by 20-year-old Amos, who called the silver medallist ‘a gentleman who to me will always be the hero of the 800m’.

Amos added: ‘I don’t think I am the man in the 800m. I will think that if I break the world record five times.Rudisha is a good man and has such sportmanship. Every time I run with him it makes me grow up.

‘He congratulated me and said, “Well done, my brother”. He always inspires me to go hard.’

It was a race that lived up to its billing as one of the highlights of the Games, with Rudisha bravely trying to dictate from the front, as is his style, but leading by only a couple of metres coming into the home straight.

Amos, the fastest 800m runner in the world this year, was boxed in initially but spotted a gap after some help from training partner Andre Olivier of South Africa, who finished third. His shorter, snappier strides quickly countered Rudisha’s long, loping sprint for the line.

It meant there was to be no fairytale comeback on British soil for 25-year-old Rudisha, who missed all of last season with a knee injury. Rudisha said: ‘I found it a little bit difficult, all because of not good preparation this year. But Nijel is a tough competitor. I think he was good tonight.’

The sodden conditions at Hampden Park did not prevent another thrilling middle-distance race in the men’s T54 1500m, a race six-time Paralympic champion David Weir has been thinking about since celebrating his four gold medals at London 2012.

The prospect of winning Commonwealth gold for England put ‘The Weirwolf’ off retirement, and he duly delivered again last night, winning in 3min 21.67sec.

Any worries about how his suede and leather gloves would grip the rims of his wheels were brushed aside as the 35-year-old took the lead with 300 metres to go and never looked back.

‘This is why I carried on,’ he said. ‘It feels like London, with so many English flags. It’s been great.’ 

Surprise: Botswana's Amos was overjoyed as he crossed the line and claimed Commonwealth gold

There was more success for England’s young sprinters, too. Jodie Williams, 20, and Bianca Williams, 21, won silver and bronze in the women’s 200m behind Nigeria’s Blessing Okagbare, who celebrated her second Commonwealth gold after victory in the 100m on Monday. Anyika Onuora, 29, also finished fourth as all three English sprinters set personal bests.

Williams’s time of 20.50sec also equalled the second fastest ever run by a British woman.

Shara Proctor, the British record-holder, was forced to retire in the first round of the long jump final and left the track in tears clutching her left hamstring, but Jazmin Sawyers of England turned bronze into silver with her final leap of the competition. The 20-year-old, a former British youth bobsledder, jumped 6.54m to finish second behind Ese Brume of Nigeria.

British champion Eilidh Child, Scotland’s poster girl for these Games, won silver in the 400m hurdles in 55.02sec. Despite a deafening roar from the crowd, the 27-year-old was unable to run down the pre-race favourite and gold medallist Kaliese Spencer of Jamaica over the final two hurdles.

England’s Jade Jones, 18, also won bronze in the women’s T54 1500m in 4min 0.19sec. The teenager is coached by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the 11-time Paralympic champion and her husband Ian Thompson. Jones said: ‘I really didn’t expect this. I’m always the youngest in the field.’
