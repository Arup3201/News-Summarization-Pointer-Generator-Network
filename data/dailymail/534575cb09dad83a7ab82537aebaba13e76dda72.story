Newt Gingrich's father was a wife-beating cheater who boasted about his conquests with other woman in front of her, reports the National Enquirer.

But the Republican presidential candidate, known as a strong opponent of domestic violence, later forgave his dad Newton 'Big Newt' McPherson.

Mr McPherson married Kathleen 'Kit' Daugherty in 1942 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, but just over three years later in 1945 they were divorced.

‘On the third day of their marriage newlywed bliss turned into a nightmare,’ a family source told the National Enquirer.

Mrs McPherson, aged 16 at the time, became pregnant as soon as she got married but her husband, 19, began to beat her, the source claimed.

Mr McPherson joined the Navy and was reportedly not around to see the birth of his son, who would go on to become a House Speaker.

Divorce papers said Mr McPherson would ‘frequently become drunk’, call his wife names, 'strike' her and not ‘display proper interest in his family’.

Mrs McPherson - who then became Mrs Gingrich - went on to have three more children with her new husband, including Candace Gingrich-Jones.

Newt Gingrich’s gay half-sister has hit the headlines for slamming his opposition to gay marriage - and saying she would back Barack Obama.

Mr McPherson died in 1970, Bob Gingrich in 1996 and Mrs Gingrich, also known as Mrs McPherson, in 2003, reported the National Enquirer.

Many critics of Newt Gingrich say he still has to convince doubters who say his personal past makes him unfit to become President.

He has said voters should look to the 'strong marriage' he has with his current wife Callista and consider the 'forgiveness' he sought from God.

Mr Gingrich married his first wife Jackie Battley, his former high school geometry teacher, in 1962 when he was 19 years old and she was 26.

They had two daughters, Kathy and Jackie. But in the spring of 1980, they split after he had an affair with Marianne Ginther.

She went on to become his second wife in 1981. But in the mid-1990s, he began an affair with House staffer Callista Bisek. They married in 2000.
