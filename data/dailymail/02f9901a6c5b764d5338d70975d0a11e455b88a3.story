Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto has called on FIFA to clamp down on Arjen Robben's diving.

Pinto and his team face Robben and Holland in the last of the World Cup quarter-finals at Arena Fonte Nova on Saturday night knowing that they need another incredible performance to get through.

But Pinto turned up the temperature in the build-up when asked about Robben and his tendency to go down easily.

'This is one of the most important questions I have been asked in this World Cup,' he said.

'Diving. This is something that makes us worry a lot. We're really worried about that. 

'I would like to ask FIFA and the referees to watch Robben closely.

'We're really worried about his diving.'

Robben was heavily criticised after winning a penalty in Holland's last game against Mexico. After that game he admitted diving to win a free-kick earlier in the game.

'He has admitted it doing it,' added Pinto.

'I hope the referee watches him very closely tomorrow.

'I would like FIFA and the referee to watch out because it is very important and can have a huge influence on the result.'

Saturday's referee is Ravshan Irmatov from Uzbekistan and Pinto believes he should book Robben if he catches him cheating.

'That may be the most logical solution,' he said.

'Maybe he would have to leave the field because he gets two yellow cards for diving.

'Why not? That could happen.

'I want to trust the referees. Let's see what happens.'
