They vowed to stay friends for the sake of their children. And it seems actress Helena Bonham Carter and director Tim Burton have stayed true to their word.

Yesterday morning the couple were pictured on a stroll in London with their two children, Billy Ray, 11, and Nell, six.

The Christmas Day outing comes just days after they announced they had separated after 13 years together.

Bonham Carter, 48, was said by friends to have been left devastated by the split and on Christmas Eve she was pictured collecting groceries, preparing for what some may have thought would be her first Christmas without Burton.

But these pictures suggest they have put whatever differences they had to one side to spend the festive period together.

Dressed for the cold weather in matching black coats, the self-confessed ‘bonkers couple’ appeared relaxed as they chatted while their children enjoyed ice lollies and chocolate on the walk in Primrose Hill.

Bonham Carter looked typically kooky, wearing chunky ankle boots, a long skirt and a floppy bobble hat. Burton, 56, best known for writing and directing romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands, wore sunglasses and carried a plastic bag.

Their spokesman said on Tuesday: ‘Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children.’

News of their separation came a year after Burton was pictured embracing a mystery blonde, thought to be one of his assistants, near his home in Hampstead.

Putting on a brave face: Helena Bonham Carter was pictured doing some last-minute Christmas shopping on December 24, just one day after she and Tim Burton announced their split after 13 years together

At the time, a spokesman for Bonham Carter denied Burton has been unfaithful, claiming the woman was part of a large group of family and friends who had been visiting the cinema with the director.

But a month later, the actress said she may no longer work with Burton again, ‘he’s getting sick of me,’ she joked.

Friends claim Bonham Carter has been in a ‘bad way’ and have accused Burton of having a ‘mid-life crisis’.

‘Helena was very upset at the Chequers party earlier this month hosted by Samantha Cameron,’ a friend has said. ‘Other guests noticed she was in a bad way. She is really upset. It’s all still very raw and they only told the children two weeks ago.’

Another friend says: ‘Tim is having a classic mid-life crisis. All Helena’s friends think he’s a terrible old cliche. Helena gave him a lot of time to sort himself out.’

Unconventional: The self-confessed 'bonkers couple' famously did not share a home, instead living next door to each other in north London with their children, Billy Ray, 10, and Nell, six. 'The houses are joined,' Bonham Carter has explained in the past 

Last week she was pictured leaving PR man Matthew Freud’s Christmas Party in the early hours of Friday morning – apparently a little worse for wear – alongside Angus Deayton and his wife.

However, she and Burton spent Saturday together, attending a production of Cats in the West End.

The unconventional couple met on the set of 2001’s Planet of the Apes, which Burton directed and went on to collaborate on a number of films.

Bonham Carter started in his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows. She is currently reprising her role as the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, which Burton is producing.

They lived next door to each other in north London with their children

Bonham Carter told previously how they only ‘sometimes’ shared a bed because of ‘a snoring issue’. ‘I talk, he snores. The other thing is, he’s an insomniac, so he needs to watch television to get to sleep. I need silence,’ she said.

The Sunday Times Rich List last year claimed the couple had a combined wealth of £80million.
