A mother battling terminal cancer has given birth to her daughter three months prematurely to help prolong her own life as she holds out hope of living long enough to take her baby home. 

Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks in Melbourne on Thursday so she can undergo further cancer treatment as her health slowly deteriorates.

 Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1kg as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours.

Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks in Melbourne on Friday with doctors fearing her cancer riddled body would not cope with a full term pregnancy

'It was difficult to be totally happy initially, I was looking at her thinking "Oh My God I'm not going to be here",' she told the Herald Sun. 

'But when they put her on my chest a couple of days later everything sank away.

'You have to keep hope. I think that's a major part of survival. My aim is to be healthy enough to care for her when she comes home.'

Ms Buchholtz and her fiancé, Alex Ansalone, have been trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together.

The couple, who have been together since April 2012, welcomed baby Ava on Friday at Royal Women’s Hospital in Melborne

Ms Buchholtz, pictured here pregnant with Ava, was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012 

The couple have terminated two pregnancies since they started trying for a family - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012. 

They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy.  

Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free.

But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine.

In just two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh.

'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone told the newspaper.

'So having the baby has been the best thing at this stage. It has helped us push through.'

Ms Buchholtz was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012. 

The tumour along with 18 lymph nodes were removed and she had a double mastectomy as a precaution.

After a blood test showed Ms Buchholtz was pregnant, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy so she could undergo intense chemotherapy.  

The couple managed to fall pregnant naturally following the treatment, but again had to terminate in September last year after learning the child would not survive due to abnormalities.

Ms Buchholtz had a double mastectomy in 2012 as a precaution when she was first diagnosed

The couple expect Ms Buchholtz's ongoing treatment to exceed $40,000 and have set up a crowd funding website to help prolong her life

In December, Ms Buchholtz had  breast reconstruction surgery and was able to return to work in February.

An MRI confirmed in August that her cancer had spread to the spine.  

Ms Buchholtz will now undergo radiotherapy and another round of chemotherapy following Ava's birth.  

The couple expect Ms Buchholtz's ongoing treatment to exceed $40,000 and have set up a crowd funding website to help prolong her life.
