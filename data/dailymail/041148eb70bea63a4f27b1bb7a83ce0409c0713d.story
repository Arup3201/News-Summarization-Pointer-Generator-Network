Ecstatic at discovering she was pregnant, Hannah Sanders set off to drive to her parents’ house to tell them.

But just 30 minutes after finding out she was expecting her first child, the 20-year-old was killed at the wheel of her Renault Clio in a collision with a pensioner’s car.

Her fiance Lee Palmer, 26, a passenger in her car, died at the scene. The couple had just collected the keys to a new flat and were looking forward to a happy future together. 

Hannah Sanders, 20, had only just found out she was pregnant- and had just collected the keys to a new flat with her fiancé Lee Palmer (pictured together) - when the crash occurred on the B269 in Limpsfield, Surrey

Miss Sanders, from Oxted, Surrey, only discovered she was expecting a baby half an hour before the crash

In a heartbreaking interview after the tragedy, Miss Sanders’s mother Pat, 59, and father David, 52, a construction manager, told how they discovered the pregnancy when police gave them a printout of the messages their daughter had posted on an online forum for mothers-to-be.

After taking a home pregnancy test and announcing the news, her last message at 1.15pm said: ‘I still won’t be 100 per cent convinced till I have like 30 lines lol x.’

Her mother said: ‘We couldn’t believe it. Hannah was so obviously thrilled and there were so many messages of congratulations – poignantly, some were even being posted after she’d died.

‘But then as news of the deaths spread, people began posting RIP condolences.’

An inquest at Surrey Coroner’s Court heard how Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer picked up the keys to their new home on the day they died – April 25 this year.

It was raining when Miss Sanders lost control of her car on a corner and skidded across the road, straight into the path of a Toyota Hilux driven by Rita Heath at 1.45pm.

Mrs Heath, 75, who will not face prosecution, told the inquest in Woking she saw the Clio ‘slide’ across the B269 road in Surrey, where the speed limit was 60mph, before the two vehicles crashed into each other.

‘The motor came round the bend and slid across the road. I looked and thought, “My God, they are on my side of the road”.’ She said there was ‘no way’ she could have avoided the car, adding: ‘It was over in seconds.’

Assistant Surrey coroner Simon Wickens recorded a conclusion of road traffic collision in the deaths of Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer, both of whom sustained multiple injuries.

Mr Wickens said: ‘Hannah was struggling to control her car at the time. It would have been a fast-moving incident.

‘There was very little more Rita Heath could do. In reality, we shall never know the reason Hannah lost control’.

Speaking before the inquest, Miss Sanders’s mother said: ‘It’s tragic that she and Lee never got to tell us their wonderful news. They would have been so happy and excited.

‘Being a mum and marrying Lee was all Hannah ever wanted.’
