Boost: David Cameron, pictured with Angela Merkel earlier this year, has been given a boost over his mission to negotiate better EU deal after the German Chancellor's party backed his plan to ban migrants sending child benefit abroad

David Cameron’s mission to negotiate a better deal for Britain in the European Union was given a boost yesterday, as Germany backed plans to ban migrants sending child benefit abroad.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly vowed to clamp down on the £30million a year sent abroad to around 40,000 children whose parents live in the UK.

He has made clear this will be one of his key demands during the ‘renegotiation’ he will push for if he wins the next election and delivers an in-out referendum in 2017.

Yesterday German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party backed proposals which would see Germany cut its child benefit payments.

MPs from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party ‎said its level should be set according to the location of the child.

They said it was wrong that Romanian seasonal workers were able to claim the German national rate of £146 a month when the equivalent rate in Romania is around £7 a month.

After his defeat in trying to block Jean-Claude Juncker from being made president of the European Commission, Mr Cameron will be cheered by the prospect of Germany’s powerful support on this issue which would require changes to EU treaties.

A Downing Street source said: ‘The CDU’s intervention underlines the growing support in Europe for action to tackle the abuse of free movement by those who move to claim, not to work.’

Mrs Merkel- who has not spoken to Mr Cameron about the benefits move - is also considering plans to limit the rights of EU migrants to stay in Germany if they fail to find a job, which would be a major change to the freedom of movement rules.

Many Tory MPs would like to see a complete repatriation of all powers to set benefits.

Andre Lindholz, Bavarian spokeswoman on migration, who are conservative allies of Mrs Merkel, told The Times on behalf of MPs from both parties: ‘Incentives for EU nationals to apply for child benefit in Germany must urgently be minimised’.

The European Commission said treaty rules on free movement do not allow discrimination on child benefit between workers from different member states.

Almost two-thirds of all child benefit exported from the UK is sent to Poland, according to latest figures released to Parliament
