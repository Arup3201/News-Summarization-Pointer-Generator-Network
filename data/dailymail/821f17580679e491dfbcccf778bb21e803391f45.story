A senior Labour politician today torn into his own party’s ‘disastrous’ record on immigration and condemned attempts to lecture high street firms about who they should employ.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the influential home affairs committee, said the roots of Britain’s problems with immigration lie in the last government’s failure get to control the borders while issuing ‘jingoistic messages’.

And he ridiculed a speech by Labour’s immigration spokesman Chris Bryant for failing to provide answers to how to deal with the numbers of people moving to Britain.

Mr Vaz called for an end to the ‘immigration arms race’ between the main parties, which he warned had caused ‘nothing but grief’ and left the ‘far-right rubbing their hands with glee’.

While rebuking  the coalition for failing to live up to some of its promises on introducing border exit checks, he saved some of his strongest criticism for his own party.

Labour’s current policy on immigration became mired in confusion on Monday as Mr Bryant embarrassingly backtracked on a planned attack on two of Britain's biggest retailers.

He had planned to use a major speech to attack Tesco and Next for using cheap migrant labour to undercut local people.

But after the retail giants hit back, the former Labour foreign minister went into reverse, declaring: 'I fully accept that Next and Tesco indeed often go the extra mile to try and recruit more local workers.'

In a withering rebuke, Mr Vaz said: ‘It is not an answer to lecture companies such as Next on where they should recruit their workers from.’

And he took a swipe at Gordon Brown’s 
infamous attempt to woo voters unhappy at the idea of foeign workers 
taking jobs. ‘”British jobs for British workers" is a jingoist message 
which should never pass the lips of a politician,’ Mr Vaz said.

In an article for the Leicester Mercury, Mr Vaz added: ‘The challenges with our immigration policy will not start on this day; they started a long time ago.

‘Seven years ago a Labour Home Secretary, John Reid, described the UK Border Agency as "not fit for purpose", yet it limped along for another five years before being abolished.

‘The previous Government oversaw the disastrous contract for E-borders, the method by which we count people in and out, which so far has lost the taxpayer £750 million.’

Last month Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted that exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration would not be reinstated before the election.

He admitted the Government would not meet a pledge to put in a system to track everyone who leaves Britain by 2015.

But he accused Home Secretary Theresa May of moving too slowly and said he was sending in Lib Dem minister David Laws to speed things up.

Mr Vaz said the coalition could not continue to blame Labour for a situation where ‘all you have to show on departure is your boarding card, not you passport’.

He called for ‘zero tolerance of illegal migration’, with loopholes closed, prompt responses to letters and an end to health tourism.

The Leicester East MP: ‘We desperately need a consensus on immigration. Let's stop this dangerous war of words, initiate a ceasefire and put forward some proposals that can command the respect of the British people. It's time to end the immigration arms race.’
