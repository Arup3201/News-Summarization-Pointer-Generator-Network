A businessman has failed in a bid to have his late mother's final will declared invalid because it was made after her memory started failing.

A judge at London's High Court said yesterday that the law ‘upholds the right of elderly people to leave their property as they choose, even if their mental faculties have declined considerably’.

He said: ‘This must include many cases in which they can no longer remember all the circumstances relevant to the division of their property between the people they wish to benefit.’

Siblings: Constance Simon, who died in January 2009 at the age of 91, has three surviving adult children - her eldest Jonathan, plus Robert Simon (left) and his twin sister, Hilary Woolley (right)

Judge Nicholas Strauss QC was ruling 
in a case in which members of a family have been involved a long-running
battle over their inheritance from mother-of-four Constance Simon.

She made her last will at her 88th birthday party arranged by family members in December 2005.

Mrs
Simon, who died in January 2009 at the age of 91, has three surviving 
adult children - her eldest Jonathan, plus Robert and his twin sister, 
Hilary Woolley.

Her youngest son, David, died before her in 2004 of cancer soon after the suicide of Louis, one of his own sons.

Mrs
Simon's assets at the time of her death - mainly to be shared between 
her children and her dead son's estate - included a house on Wellington Road in St John's Wood, north-west London, valued at the time at £1.75million, and a flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, worth £262,500.

The block of flats was on the site of a hotel where the family had spent ‘fondly-remembered holidays’, said the judge.

Other assets included savings and 
shares worth about £55,000 and 16 shares in R.W. Simon Ltd, a company 
manufacturing trade moulds founded by Mrs Simon's late husband.

Robert, who has an adult daughter, has been managing director since 1982.

The judge said that, from about 2000, 
before the onset of serious mental decline, Mrs Simon lived with Robert 
and his wife, Michelle, at their house in Chigwell, Essex, but still 
spent a night or two at Wellington Road.

The
court heard that a will made nine years before the birthday had 
favoured Robert, gifting him the Westcliff flat and his mother's 16 
company shares, said the judge.

A March 1993 letter recorded Mrs 
Simon's reasons for favouring him including that he had been mainly 
responsible for the family company's success, and that he had looked 
after her and other family members.

The
judge said: ‘Hilary believes that letter may have been wholly or in 
part forged by Robert, but this was not put to him in cross-examination 
and I must disregard it.’

Iris Jolly, March 2013A couple said they were left a £500,000 legacy by the 80-year old 'spoilt princess' because she was cross with her family - but were stripped of the money by a High Court judge. She ruled the will was invalid because Mrs Jolly was not in her right mind when she signed it.

The orphan got to see none of his 
adoptive parents' £70,000 life savings after they signed each other’s 
wills by mistake - and the Court of Appeal had no power to 
correct the error.

The 58-year-old lecturer contested her parents' will after they left their £2.4million estate to the RSPCA - and won her legal challenge. The court agreed that her father coerced her mother into making the document that gave the charity their 287-acre land.

Robert
did not attend the birthday party, held at the Wellington Road house, 
when Mrs Simon made her final will. The will took from Robert his sole 
right to the flat and the company shares.

The
party was attended by mother-of-three Hilary, who lives at Crossley 
Hill, Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Jonathan, of Shoeburyness, Essex, who
also has three adult children.

The will was prepared and executed without Mrs Simon being medically examined, and without a solicitor being present.

The judge said: ‘Since there have been
disputes about the running of the family company, the significance of 
the 16 shares in the hands of one person might well be greater than 
their financial value.’

Robert accused his siblings in court of ‘sinister and reprehensible’ behaviour.

The
judge said that, since Hilary and Jonathan had benefited from the 
changes at the expense of Robert, he had been bound to approach the 
issue of knowledge of the new will and its approval with care.

But
any initial suspicion there might have been was dispelled by the 
evidence of Hilary and Jonathan and other witnesses which he found to be
‘truthful and substantially accurate’.

Rejecting
the accusations of ‘sinister’ behaviour, the judge found that Mrs Simon
knew that her existing will did not favour her children and their 
families equally, and she wished to execute a will that did so.

All the family, he said, were agreed that
Mrs Simon was ‘throughout her life a delightful lady of great charm and
forceful character, and that she was devoted to her family including 
all her children’.

The judge said Robert wanted the 
birthday will declared invalid because, by the time it was made in 
December 2005, his mother was suffering from mild to moderate dementia 
and therefore lacked mental capacity to make a valid will.

The
judge agreed that Mrs Simon ‘was not capable of remembering her reasons
for preferring Robert in her previous will, or its terms’.

But
he said to rule that Mrs Simon did not have testamentary capacity 
‘would be inconsistent with the authorities which support the right of 
elderly people to make a will disposing of their property as they see 
fit, even if their mental faculties are far from being at their peak’.

The
judge said there must be many legal cases in which people could no 
longer remember ‘all the circumstances relevant to the division of their
property between the people they wished to benefit’.

He said: ‘To make this a qualification of testamentary capacity would be inconsistent with the case law.’

There
might be cases where it might be necessary for a testator to understand
the different provisions of an earlier will - but ‘this is not such a 
case’.

The previous valid 
will made by Mrs Simon was nine years earlier. The beneficiaries of both
wills were ‘obvious’ and they all received substantial gifts, and no 
one was omitted, said the judge.

Mrs
Simon had been ‘reminded of the previous, unequal, will and could have 
asked to see it to remind herself of its provisions’ but chose not to do
so.

Judge Strauss said the dispute over the company and other issues, including worries over inheritance tax, had gone on over many years.

In October 2004, shortly after Louis's suicide and while David was approaching death, matters had come to a head. By then both David and Hilary were aware that their mother's will did not leave all her property to her four children equally.

The judge said David had written in a family letter that he believed Robert had drawn up the terms of the then current will ‘in such a way that it was favourable to his, and his family’, and he wished to express ‘at this late stage in my life’ his disquiet over his brother's ‘cavalier attitude to the rest of the family’.

David reminded other family members of one of his mother's favourite quotations: that ‘if she had just one apple left she would cut the apple into four equal parts’.

The judge said Robert was greatly angered by David's letter, believing that Hilary was its real author and had taken advantage of David and ‘orchestrated this scam’. The accusation was denied by Hilary.

Sarah Haren, appearing for Robert, asked the judge for permission to appeal against his ruling, saying the case involved ‘an important and interesting question of principle’ regarding Mrs Simon's capacity to execute a will.

But the judge refused permission. Robert can still ask the appeal judges themselves to hear his case.
