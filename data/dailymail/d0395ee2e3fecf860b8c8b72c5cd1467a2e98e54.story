Michael Warrener, who was jailed for 19 years in May for the rape and indecent assault of his daughter Claire Warrener. An inquest heard how she killed herself after reporting her father to the police

A woman killed herself after reporting her father to police for raping her when she was a child.

Claire Warrener, 22, finally gained the courage to report the abuse in 2010, six years after it ended.

But she found it hard to cope after telling police she had been abused from the age of 11, an inquest was told.

Michael Warrener, 59, of Newcastle, went on to stand trial for raping and indecently assaulting her and was convicted in May this year.

Claire took her own life months after reporting the sick attacks, and the sentencing judge at Newcastle Crown Court blamed her father for her death as he handed Warrener a 19-year jail term.

An inquest in Sunderland yesterday heard how Claire’s cousin Ashleigh found her body in the kitchen of her home in Hendon.

Paramedics tried to save her, but she was pronounced dead at Sunderland Royal Hospital on December 9 last year.

Her sister Stacey broke down and was unable to continue giving evidence to the hearing held at Sunderland Civic Centre.

Stacey said: 'He had been following her about town. She was scared about the trial.'

Investigating officer Detective Constable David Garrity, who led the investigation into the allegations about Michael Warrener, gave evidence at the hearing.

He said: 'Prior to her death, she had made a report to the police with regards to sexual abuse by her father.

'I think on speaking with Claire and throughout the investigation, it had a clearly significant effect and massive impact on her life.'

Dr Hugh Cochrane, a pathologist at Sunderland Royal Hospital, said Claire would have died suddenly from heart failure.

He added that there were marks of self-harm on her body and small amounts of alcohol and amphetamine was found in her blood.

Coroner Derek Winter praised Claire’s 'courage' in reporting the abuse.

He said: 'The death of Claire Warrener was a very tragic culmination of events in her life around which she had very little, if any control.'

He recorded a verdict that Claire had killed herself.
