'Fixated' on minutiae: Former RBS boss Fred Goodwin is described as a 'control freak' in a new account

He was at the helm when the Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed, leaving taxpayers to pick up a £45billion government bailout bill.

But despite the demands of running a global financial institution, disgraced boss Fred Goodwin was ‘fixated’ with trifles like the design of company Christmas cards, a new book claims.

The man dubbed ‘Fred the Shred’ for his cost-cutting fanaticism was a micro-managing control freak who also banned Sellotape and ordered company cars to be the correct shade of blue.

He was obsessed with cleanliness and spent ‘hours in meetings’ poring over colours used in advertising campaigns.

But he had ‘very little interest in the traditional components of a bank chief’s activities’, the account claims. 

And staff who worried that he had a ‘limited grasp’ on RBS’s investment bank were too afraid to voice criticism in case they ended up in ‘Fred’s black book’.

The account, called Making it Happen: Fred Goodwin, RBS and the Men who Blew up the Economy, is written by Iain Martin, the former editor of the Scotsman newspaper.

He describes how one rant against papers left on filing cabinets led to an order by Mr Goodwin for all cabinets to have dome-shaped tops. ‘Somewhere in a warehouse are thousands of old flat-top RBS filing cabinets that were not Fred-compliant,’ an RBS manager says in the book.

Mr Goodwin also ‘became very hands on’ when it came to ordering a new fleet of chauffeur-driven Mercedes for the bank’s executive team. 

He demanded that the shade of blue must exactly match the RBS logo – and the leather interiors had to be the same shade of beige as the office carpets.

‘He was obsessed by all sorts of small details and measuring things and all sorts of minutiae,’ one of his former colleagues reveals.

‘We would spend hours in meetings discussing the wrong things: colours for advertising campaigns, computer systems and targets were what grabbed him.

‘I think it meant he thought he was on top of things, when he wasn’t.’ When presented with a selection of Christmas card designs, Mr Goodwin ‘blew his top and said they were all terrible’.

‘That’s it, he declared. I’m taking over direct control of the production of the Christmas card,’ the book claims. A previous book revealed Mr Goodwin’s anger at  receiving the wrong type of biscuits at meetings – issuing catering staff  with disciplinary action after he was offered pink wafers.

He would often spring surprise inspections on unwary staff ¿ and banned the use of Sellotape in public areas of the bank

The latest account of Mr Goodwin’s management style describes his obsession with cleanliness.While chief executive of Clydesdale Bank, he demanded that a discarded cigarette be removed – after it was spotted by his mother on the steps of the firm’s HQ in Glasgow.

He would often spring surprise inspections on unwary staff – and banned the use of Sellotape in public areas of the bank. 

Those who ignored his edicts would get a ‘sharp rebuke’, the book claims.

Divisional managers were even summoned to explain how they had contributed to his cleaning project – with many unable to stifle a laugh at their boss’s clinical obsessions.

His pursuit of cleanliness was so rigorous that he was once arrested by police for taking photos outside a Clydesdale branch because the area around its cash machine ‘looked messy’.

Mr Goodwin’s wrath was notorious – and even extended even to those closest to him.

He once berated David Thorburn, another Clydesdale executive who had been best man at his wedding, in front of an entire room for moving a statue in one of the bank’s branches in Aberdeen.‘He [Fred] went absolutely mental,’ a friend of Mr Thorburn said.

Mr Goodwin was also said to enjoy ‘infamously epic’ drinking sessions during team-building away days with senior banking executives.

But despite his capacity for ‘large amounts of whisky and beer’, the RBS chief became a ‘demonic corporate robot’ once back in the office, where executives were ‘terrified into submission’.

The book also claims the bank ignored a whistleblower who alleged that huge losses were being covered up more than a year before the 2008 bailout.

Mr Goodwin, who was knighted in 2004, became a public hate figure four years later when he stepped down following the rescue of RBS, but retained a huge pension deal.

He was stripped of his knighthood last year.
