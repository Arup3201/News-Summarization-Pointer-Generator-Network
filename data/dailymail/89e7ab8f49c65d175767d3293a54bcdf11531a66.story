A devoted husband has completed seven of the world's toughest marathons in seven days for his childhood sweetheart.

Ted Jackson, 42, from Surrey, has ran 182 miles through the icy blizzards and desert terrain for his wife, Sophie, 40, who suffers from multiple sclerosis - an incurable neurological disease.

The father-of-four, has raised more than £160,000 from running the marathons in  seven continents, which  took more than 45 hours to complete.

Sophie was diagnosed in 2010 and has had the help of the charity Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis. By running the marathons Ted raised £160,000 for them

Ted's campaign will help the charity, Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis (OMS), that helps sufferers with the day to day challenges the condition brings.

Ted said: 'I was determined to complete the seven marathons for my childhood sweetheart.

'She means the world to me, our family was left devastated when she was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.'

He continued: 'It is such an awful disease that millions of people suffer from, but the charity changed our lives and that's why I became so adamant to raise so much money for them.

'There's no cure to MS and it has often felt like a death sentence but since being introduced to OMS, Sophie's life has changed dramatically.

'There used to be a cloud hanging over her head but the charity has really helped her so I wanted to do as much as I could to raise awareness.

Ted says he wasn't much of a runner before but the thought of his childhood sweetheart, Sophie, got him through

'I signed myself up for the event without thinking - I'm not athletic at all, that's why I wanted to do it, to prove that if I can do it anyone can.

'I put myself in a position where failing wasn't an option, I often sign up to things without thinking but thankfully I'm stubborn and determined enough to power through.'

Competitors had to complete each marathon in under eight hours and often only had time to sleep in airport lounges and on flights as they ran through marathons in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco, Dubai, before finishing in Sydney.

His fundraising on Iknowtedjackson.com drew attention from celebrities including Phillip Schofield, Clare Balding and Gary Linekar.

Ted was surprised to complete the challenge with very little training for the events in some of the harshest of conditions.

He said: 'For me there was 500 per cent more effort going into fundraising than training for the actual marathons, I knew I'd be able to do it - thinking of Sophie got me through.

'The Antarctic marathon was one the most interesting, getting there is so difficult because it's such a remote area, then you have the cold to deal with, by the end of the marathon there were icicles forming on my beard.'

Ted relied on compression socks, and careful taping of his sore feet to get through the seven marathons

Ted says that his hardest challenge came on the fifth day: 'Day five's marathon in Marrakesh was the toughest. Having done three marathons in the space of 37 hours I was extremely tired.

'In Dubai's marathon I took a break from the road to sing the song, Nessun Dorma, for a couple who were getting married on the beach.

'It must have been quite a surreal moment for them but I had time to spare on the run and thought it would be something special to make their day.

'They didn't speak English so I couldn't be sure but they seemed to enjoy it, I posed for a few pictures then went back to running.'

At the final finish line in Sydney, Australia, Ted was greeted by Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis, Professor George Jelinek, who runs the charity that improved the quality of Sophie's life.

The programme encourages MS patients to increase the amount of Vitamin D they intake and eat a meat-free low-saturated fat diet, which dramatically improved Sophie's life after she was diagnosed in 2010.

Sophie and Ted met when they were 18 and she says they have been inseparable ever since

Sophie says she knew Ted would complete the challenge even though he's not naturally active

Sophie first noticed something noticed something was wrong when her words became slurred while in the bath. 

At the time she feared she'd had a stroke but brain scans revealed she had multiple sclerosis - a condition that affects more 100,000 people in the UK.

Sophie said: 'I wasn't given a lot of hope when they told me I had MS, you can't help but think of a lifetime of wheelchairs and pain.

'Me and Ted have been inseparable since we were 18 and it seemed like a big axe hanging over us, I dreaded the way the disease would affect our family.

'But since the programme I feel a lot more positive about the disease, I'm healthier and am thinking a lot more about life beyond the disease.

'I'm amazed at Ted, he's not a runner or an athlete by any stretch of the imagination, and he knew that, that's why he choose the hardest one out there.'

Sophie went to cheer her husband on at marathon number four in Madrid with daughter, Alabama, 17, taking a picture to mark the moment.

She said: 'He didn't know I was coming so was just overwhelmed to see me. He looked absolutely exhausted but I knew he could do it.

'I kept in constant contact tracking his whereabouts and how he was getting on, with every marathon he completed I knew he was one step closer to home.

'When we went to pick him up from the airport it was amazing, there were around 50 kids from the boarding school where we work who came to welcome him home.

'The charity has really changed my life, it has given me a spring in my step again so knowing Ted's raised so much for this charity is astonishing, he truly is my hero.'

When Ted arrived back home after his grueling challenge he was greeted by happy friends and family
