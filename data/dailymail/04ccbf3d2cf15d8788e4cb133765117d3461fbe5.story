Media baron Rupert Murdoch bought himself a lavish divorce present – the top four floors of one of the most exclusive condominium towers in Manhattan.

Murdoch, 82, reportedly paid over $57million for the new bachelor pad at One Madison, which overlooks Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District and is also home to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his supermodel wife.

The News Corporation chairman made the move after former wife Wendi Deng was awarded the former couple’s $44million Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse as part of their divorce settlement, sources told the New York Times.

Gorgeous: A spiral staircase leads from the other floors to the main great room, which is double the height of any floor in the building

Building owner Related Companies touted the sale in a press release without naming the buyer.Murdoch’s new 10,000-plus square feet digs take up floors 57 to 60 and boast floor to ceiling windows and a wraparound terrace.

The five bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom perch also offers uninterrupted, ‘cinematic,’ river-to-river views of Manhattan from the World Trade Center to the northern tip of Madison Avenue.

It was purchased in ‘raw condition,’ which means Murdoch will be supplying all of the furnishings, fixtures and other accoutrements.

A fully finished three-bedroom residence on the 56th floor, perhaps for staff, was also included in the hefty purchase price. The extra residence could also ’easily be combined’ to the larger penthouse above, according to the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal.

The residence has its own private internal elevator, the Journal noted.

Murdoch had a tough time parting with the Fifth Avenue penthouse, sources told the Times. He had long wanted the former Rockefeller-owned residence before finally buying it in 2005.

His former wife of 14 years will live at their old home with their two children Grace and Chloe, according to the terms of their divorce.

Murdoch is joined in the tony tower by Brady and supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen, they purchased their $14million, 47th-floor, three-bedroom home late last year.
