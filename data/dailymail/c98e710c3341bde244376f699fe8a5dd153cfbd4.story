A Bulgarian bishop has been sacked from his post after video emerged of him taking part in an orgy with four women.

Bishop Boris, who headed the second largest monastery in Bulgaria, was filmed frolicking at a sex party with four women, which then leaked online and subsequently to the media.

Bishop Boris was forced to step down after being found guilty of acts ‘incompatible with his office’, a statement from the Holy Synod, the Orthodox Church's supreme clerical body read.

Boris, who was known for his weakness for earthly luxuries such as cars, women and fine wine, risks excommunication.

The case must now be examined by the ecclesiastical court. The Holy Synod is also expected to rule on the case of the monastery of Troyan, central Bulgaria, where the monks were were caught having gay orgies.

Bishop Boris headed Bachkovski Monastery, located about 117 miles from the Bulgarian capital Sofia.

It is one of the oldest monasteries in the country, founded in 1083 as a Byzantine Iberian Orthodox monastery.

It draws thousands of visitors every year and is considered one of the main tourist attractions in the area.

The sex party is only the latest scandal to hit the Bulgarian church, which counts 80 per cent of the population as followers, after revelations last year that senior clergy had been agents of the former communist regime.

The body of former collaborator Bishop Kiri was found on a Black Sea beach last summer.
