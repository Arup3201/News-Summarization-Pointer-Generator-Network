Boss Paul Lambert insisted he always knew Roy Keane was the right fit for Aston Villa - and was too good for TV.

The former Manchester United midfielder was working as a pundit for ITV, alongside his role as the Republic of Ireland's assistant manager, before joining Villa.

He replaced the sacked Ian Culverhouse in July as a surprise choice to work alongside Lambert.

Villa have been superb so far in the Premier League - beating Liverpool at Anfield last week

Lambert and Keane are both known for their similar uncompromising styles to management 

But, ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League visit of Arsenal, Lambert believes the move has been perfect.

'The two of us are really strong characters. I knew he had a lot of football knowledge that was unfairly tarnished. His knowledge meant he was too good to be a TV pundit,' he said.

'To get him back in the game was great. I love working with him, we have a laugh.

'Not everything is serious. I beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day.

'When I was thinking about people to bring in, I know it probably raised a few eyebrows, 'How's that going to work?' Nobody sees the logic in it. I just knew in my gut it would work. Alright, there will be times when we don't win games but we'll never break anything.

'He's been great around the place, with the staff and the lads. He likes a laugh as well. I don't think he's the big bad guy out there that. He's somebody I know I can rely on.

'I never had any doubts. He was the first port of call when I knew I had to get somebody in.'

Second placed Villa will go top, for 24 hours, as leaders Chelsea do not play Manchester City until Sunday, with victory against the Gunners.

Keane had his own battles with Arsenal as a United player, memorably squaring up to Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel but Lambert said Keane's winning-mentality shone through.

'The Arsenal tunnel was pretty small at that time wasn't it, there was no hiding place,' he said.

'If you look at his football career he is probably the best midfielder to come out of this country. There is no getting away from that. He was a winner and you make no apologies for being a winner.'
