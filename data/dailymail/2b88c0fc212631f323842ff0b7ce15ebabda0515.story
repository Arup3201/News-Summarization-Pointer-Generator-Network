It was a chilling encounter which forced Wanda Stead's 'heart into her throat'.

The Canadian woman was filming an iceberg from a boat in the Bay of Exploits, Newfoundland, on Tuesday when it suddenly disintegrated.

Huge chunks of ice collapsed into the water, causing what she thought was a tidal wave to surge toward the boat.

In footage uploaded to YouTube, Stead can be heard howling at her husband who was operating the boat: 'Run, Rick, go - GO!'

'I think my heart came up, and I 
swallowed it. I was petrified,'  Stead told CBC News. 'All I could see was this tidal wave coming toward us.'

Although it was not tidal wave, the bay's waters 
did surge when the iceberg shattered.

Stead said she shared the video to warn others of the dangers of approaching icebergs. The couple's boat was about 150 feet away when the ice began to crack.

'We
 were too close,' she said. 'Accidents are unplanned events. You never know with something that big … and people need to know.'
