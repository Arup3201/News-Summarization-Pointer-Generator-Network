Ronald Koeman has had worse birthdays. On the same day he turned 52, Southampton kept themselves in the hunt for European football, and it was gift-wrapped by Burnley themselves.

Shane Long’s first strike in the Barclays Premier League since November and an own goal by Jason Shackell did the trick against a Burnley team threatened with being sent back to where they came from last season.

As for Southampton it will take some doing to get rid of them. Just when Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United thought Champions League qualification was primarily a scrap among themselves, this served as a reminder.

MATCH RATING BY KIERAN GILL AT ST MARY'S STADIUM

‘The boys gave me the best present for my birthday,’ said Koeman, who was serenaded by the St Mary’s crowd with their rendition of Happy Birthday. ‘A good win. An important win. Three points. Nice present.’

Yet it was horribly tense at times, as it should be against a team fighting for their Premier League lives. Burnley, fresh from beating Manchester City last week, made the Saints sing for their supper.

Southampton moved to within a point of Liverpool, albeit a game ahead, and did so without Fraser Forster, the keeper with the most clean sheets in the Premier League this season.

No sooner had the game got started than it was interrupted when Forster, named in Roy Hodgson’s England squad this week, had to be carried off on a stretcher after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by Sam Vokes. There was nothing in it as the Burnley striker tried to block the goalkeeper’s clearance but Forster was replaced by the 38-year-old Kelvin Davis, and Koeman does not think he will be able to feature for England this month.

Yet Southampton made do without Forster, and Long settled their nerves on 38 minutes.

A deflected low drive by Nathaniel Clyne from the right corner of the penalty area somehow found the unmarked forward at the back post.

A simple tap-in was all that was required, and the Irishman obliged.

Southampton have dropped just two points from winning positions this season — fewer than any other team — but this was scrappy, to say the least.

Graziano Pelle should have scored, and passed the dreaded 1,000-minute mark in the Premier League since his last goal. He hit the crossbar from close range, produced air-kicks, had headers saved, and his luck never improved. 

‘The first half was a little bit more difficult. We had good chances to score more than one goal,’ Koeman added. ‘There was good movement, good attacking, good chances.

‘Pelle was a little unlucky, but he was working hard. That’s what you have to do if you don’t score. Your team-rate is important.The goals will come,’ insisted Koeman. It was a good win.’

The game died when Burnley shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute. Ryan Bertrand had been a nuisance throughout, and his cross led to an outstretched knee by Burnley defender Shackell turning Ryan Bertrand’s cross into his own net under no pressure.

Southampton, then, remain in the race, and the seemingly impossible remains possible.
