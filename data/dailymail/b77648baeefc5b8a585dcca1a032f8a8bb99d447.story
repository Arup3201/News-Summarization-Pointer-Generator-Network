England’s top cricket stars today paid their final respects to batsman Tom Maynard, who was hit by a London Underground train last month.

More than 100 mourners attended the funeral of the 'talented and fun-loving' Surrey cricketer at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff.

Freddie Flintoff, Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Marcus Trescothick, Mike Gatting, Alec Stewart, Mark Ramprakash and Robert Croft were among the line-up of cricket stars at the service.

Mr Maynard’s model girlfriend Carly Baker - who paid tribute to him as the 'most special man' on the day of his death- was also present, as was former X Factor finalist and family friend Lucy Jones. Miss Jones sang two songs during the service.

There was also a rousing version of 
the Welsh rugby song Cwm Rhondda - Bread of Heaven - as cricket stars 
were joined by rugby legend Gareth Edwards.

Many of the congregation were in tears as tributes were paid to Mr Maynard, whose photograph stood on his coffin.

Former Welsh cricketer Hugh Morris 
said: 'Tom was not only a player blessed with extraordinary talent but 
someone whose sense of fun and enjoyment made him a hugely popular 
figure in the game.

'The cricketing family has lost a 
treasured friend and teammate who enlivened the dressing room or lit up 
any social occasion with his warmth and good humour.

'He was never one to shirk any kind of challenge, sporting or otherwise. He was surely destined for the highest reaches of the game.'

Mr Maynard's friends were urged to 
bring photos and other keepsakes of the player for the family to make a 
lasting montage to him.

His heartbroken father, and former 
England batsman, Matthew Maynard, 45, mother Sue, 51, and sister Ceri, 
19, sat holding hands throughout the service.

His uncle Charles Maynard told mourners: 'Tom always wanted to have fun - it’s how he wanted to live his life.

'He had a cheeky and adorable manner with a huge smile. He was a very special person and will stay forever in our hearts.'

Following the
service, England captain Andrew Strauss said: 'His death is a tragic 
loss - Tom was forging a real name for himself in the game.'

Richard Thompson, the chairman of 
Surrey Cricket Club, where Mr Maynard played, described him as 'a one 
off - totally irreplaceable'.

The coffin was carried into the crematorium to one of Tom’s favourite songs, We Are Young by U.S. band Fun.

The Surrey team song, A Little 
Respect by Erasure, was played at the service as were Mr Maynard's 
favourites, including songs by Coldplay and The Calling.

A family spokesman said: 'Matthew, 
Sue and Ceri would like to reiterate their thanks to everyone for the 
many hundreds of cards, letters, emails and messages they have received 
following the tragic death of their son Tom. The level of support has been of real comfort to them.'

Mr Maynard - the son of former 
Glamorgan cricket legend Matthew Maynard - was regarded by many as one 
of the sport's bright prospects.

In 2007, on his Glamorgan First XI debut he hit 71 runs from 75 balls - and was later snapped up by Surrey.

He was pronounced dead after being struck by a Tube train in the early hours of June 18 in Wimbledon, south London.

An inquest has been opened and adjourned
at Westminster Coroner's Court - with Dr Shirley Radcliffe saying 
'extensive investigations' were continuing.

It
emerged last night that Rory Hamilton-Brown, the Surrey captain who today helped carry Mr Maynard's coffin into church, is to 
take an indefinite break from cricket after struggling to cope with the 
death of his close friend.

The 24-year-old, who shared a house 
with Mr Maynard, will distance himself from the sport as he tries to 
come to terms with the tragedy.

Following the death, Surrey immediately told its players they did not have to play on if they felt they could not.

After
initially returning to action against Hampshire on Sunday, Mr 
Hamilton-Brown has decided he now needs to withdraw from the game.

He
said: ‘I am grateful to the club for their support and understanding of
my decision. I look forward to returning to the game when I hope I can 
continue my form of recent seasons.’

Jade
Dernbach and Stuart Meaker were this week released from the England 
squad on compassionate grounds ahead of today’s one-day international 
against Australia at Edgbaston and both attended the funeral along with 
the whole of the Surrey squad.

Cordoned off: The black Mercedes belonging to Maynard was left just a few streets from where he died

Detectives probing Mr Maynard's 
death, which took place while he was fleeing police, want to find out 
what happened during 50 minutes when officers lost him.

The sportsman was suspected of 
drink-driving after police spotted his Mercedes C250 coupe swerving 
across the road near Wimbledon Park underground station just after 4am 
on June 18.

Mr Maynard, who was believed to have been heading to his girlfriend Miss Baker's home, was then chased by a police car.

But after getting out of the car and running away on foot, officers and their sniffer dogs lost the talented cricketer.

Fifty minutes later Mr Maynard 
stepped on a high-voltage rail before being struck by the first Tube 
train of the day at Wimbledon Park.

The police watchdog, which routinely 
investigates any potential wrongdoing by officers when a suspect dies, 
were notified about the incident the same day.

The following day they referred the 
case back to Scotland Yard and asked them to examine what happened 
during the ‘lost’ 50 minutes because it may shed light on why Mr Maynard
died.

The IPCC said it has assessed the 
incident, and referred it back to Scotland Yard because the pursuing 
officers had lost sight of Mr Maynard and had no further contact with 
him before his death.

About 50 minutes passed between the start of the police chase and Mr Maynard being hit by the train.

After leaving his car the cricketer ran off on foot, leaving his BlackBerry and other personal items behind.

Worshippers at a nearby mosque said 
the two officers did not give chase, but radioed details of the incident
to their control room. Colleagues arrived with sniffer dogs and began 
searching gardens.

Shortly after 5am, the driver of a 
District line Tube train saw a body lying across the tracks a short 
distance from the station.

Police suspect Mr Maynard stepped on 
the live rail and was knocked unconscious or killed outright before 
being hit by an early morning train.
