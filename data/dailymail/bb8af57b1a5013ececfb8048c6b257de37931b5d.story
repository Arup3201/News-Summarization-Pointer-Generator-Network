Carlo Ancelotti has always been one for diplomacy, and that's no different in Wednesday's nationals over in Spain.

The Real Madrid boss has been looking ahead to next week's Champions League final against city rivals Atletico.

Ancelotti spoke about Diego Simeone's side being a 'fighting team' who will push 'from the first minute to the last' in AS.

Be careful! Carlo Ancelotti has warned his Real Madrid players they face a stiff test against 'fighting' Atletico

All very sedate - not wholly surprising - but Marca went for a slightly more eye-catching front which, instead of the manager getting out of his car, had a celebratory splash picture with a headline to intimate that they could become conquerors of Europe.

Sport and Mundo Deportivo - two other daily papers - both concentrated on Barcelona, as is the norm.

Lionel Messi says he wants to win the La Liga title for Tito Vilanova.

The Catalans have come from nowhere in the final weeks of the season to potentially gazump both Madrid sides.

A win against Atletico this week would seal an unexpected title.

Meanwhile, one man who looks set to is striker Alexis Sanchez. Barca want to thrash out a deal with Juventus before the start of the World Cup.
