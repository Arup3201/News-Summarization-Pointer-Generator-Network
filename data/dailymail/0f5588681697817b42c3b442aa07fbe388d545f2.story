Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge took to social media to play down concerns about his injury on Monday afternoon.

The England striker missed the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland after picking up a thigh problem in training on Friday following the friendly win over Norway 48 hours earlier.

Sturridge has been sent for more scans to assess the full extent of the damage, but is a major doubt for Saturday's Premier League clash with Aston Villa.
