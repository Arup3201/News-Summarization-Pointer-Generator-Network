Christian Atsu  made the decision to join Everton on a season-long loan from Chelsea  after recognising that his time on the pitch at Stamford Bridge would have been severely limited.

The 22-year-old passed his medical at Goodison on Wednesday  to become Everton's fifth signing of the summer, and  followed in the footsteps of former Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku in doing so.

Atsu stressed playing a role in the team was important to him, and believes he will be given more of a chance under Roberto Martinez rather than Jose Mourinho.

'I can't tell you the future but I don't know how long it will take for me to get back to Chelsea,' said Atsu.

'At the end of the season, we will see what will happen.

'I think looking at the players Chelsea has, my playing there would be not much. For me, I have to play football. Everton is a really good club and I'm here to work hard to help the team.

'I had a possibility to go elsewhere but I chose Everton.

'I think (Martinez) played an important role for me being here but also, I made the decision to come because they are a good club and I believe I'll be more successful here.' 

And Atsu can't wait to make his Premier League debut.

'This is my first season in the Premier League and it's a really high level for me, and this is a big opportunity for me to prove myself and also to help the team,' he continued. 

'I'm very happy and proud to be an Everton player. Since I came here, I've been happy with the coach and the fans on Twitter. It's been a great moment.

'I think it's a really good move for me because they play football, they're a hard-working team and they have a great coach with fantastic fans.

'So far now, I'm really happy and I think I'll continue to be happy at Everton. 

'It was really good experience to be in the World Cup. I want to help the team, to enjoy myself and to play football. That's what I hope to achieve here.

'I believe in the team, I believe in the players we have, the fans, and at the end of the season we will all be happy.'

Atsu became Everton's fifth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway.
