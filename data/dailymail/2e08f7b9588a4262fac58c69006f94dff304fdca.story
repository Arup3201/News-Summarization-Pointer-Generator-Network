Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe wept today as beloved actor Richard Griffiths was laid to rest at a church where Shakespeare was buried.

The Hollywood actor was one of 300 mourners paying their respects to the 65-year-old, best known for his roles in Withnail and I, Pie in the Sky and The History Boys.

Mr Radcliffe led tributes to his friend during the funeral service at Holy Trinity church in Stratford-upon-Avon, saying he made any room 'twice as funny'.

Success: Veteran star Mr Griffiths pictured picking up his Tony Award in New York in 2006. The actor died last week aged 65

One mourner said: 'Daniel was clearly
very fond of Richard, as anyone who ever met him was, and was crying 
quite openly in church.

'It was a beautiful service and Richard would have been touched by how many people turned up to say goodbye.

'Richard was a tremendous character 
and the service was full of laughter and tears as his life was 
remembered with immense warmth and affection.'

Mr Griffiths' 3ft-wide coffin, 
especially made to accommodate his bulky frame, entered the church to 
the hymn Praise My Soul The King of Heaven.

Inside the plain order of service, a 
portrait of Mr Griffiths playing Hector in The History Boys was printed 
along with the poem Late Fragment by Raymond Carver.

His fellow actor Paul Jesson read an 
excerpt from Kenneth Grahame's Wind In The Willows before two more poems
read by family friends.

Former Bond girl Carmen Du Sautoy read from Ecclesiastes, then tenor Graham Neal sung Danny Boy.

Mr Griffiths' agent Simon Beresford 
spoke of his life with the actor and sitcom star Penelope Wilton read Mr
Griffiths' favourite Edward Lear poem, The Owl and the Pussycat.

Warwickshire town.

He is survived by Heather, his wife of 33 years, who lives in the couple's home in the nearby village of Bearley.Â
