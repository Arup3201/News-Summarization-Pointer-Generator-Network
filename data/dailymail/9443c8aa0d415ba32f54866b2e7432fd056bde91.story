The Mauritius ambassador to the U.S. has been fined in federal court after paying his Filipina housekeeper just $1,000 a month to work six days a week.

His Excellency Somduth Soborun was fined $5,000 on Monday in a Newark court. The ambassador took a plea deal and also agreed to a $24,153 restitution payment to the woman.

The 61-year-old ambassador brought the woman to his $1.2million home in Englewood, New Jersey from the Philippines after arranging a visa.

She cleaned, did laundry and took care of the dog for 12 hours a day for the equivalent of $3.57 - far below minimum wage of $7.25.

Soborun, who earns up to $200,000, organized a visa for the woman, who has only been identified by the initials CV. She was employed from December 2008 until August 2009.

Police and FBI were informed of CV's treatment leading to an investigation into her pay and working conditions.

U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman told the New York Post: 'Although Soborun signed a contract that provided for an hourly wage as well as for overtime pay for any hours exceeding 40 per week, Soborun only paid C.V. $1,000 per month, regardless of how many hours she worked each month.'

He will be allowed to keep his job as ambassador for Mauritius, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean.

Plea deal: Mr Soborun leaves court with his lawyer on Monday after being forced to pay $24,000 restitution to his housekeeper, allowing him to keep his job

In his role as ambassador, Mr Soborun is responsible for his Mauritius' interests in the U.S. along with protecting and offering advice to Mauritians abroad.

Calls to the Embassy of Mauritius in Washington D.C. and the ambassador's lawyer Nicholas Doria were not returned to MailOnline.

Regardless of visa status, foreign workers have the right to be paid $7.25 an hour in the U.S. Overtime - which constitutes anything more than 40 hours a week - should be one and a half time's minimum wage.

Somduth Soborun became Ambassador of Mauritius to the United States on January 28, 2011. Before taking up his ambassadorial role, he worked at the U.N for three years in Cairo.
