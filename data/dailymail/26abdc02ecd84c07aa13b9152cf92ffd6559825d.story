A 27-year-old school mistress has been banned from teaching for life after she invited a 16-year-old school boy to her home and kissed him.

Heather Bartlett, who taught Geography at Hitchin Boys' School, was found guilty of unprofessional conduct after police cautioned her for engaging in sexual activity with a teenager.

She was told by a disciplinary panel she would not be allowed back into a classroom after admitting to meeting the male pupil on three separate occasions. 

Ban: Heather Bartlett was a teacher at Hitchin Boys' School when she received a police caution for sexual activity with a male pupil

The National College for Teaching and Leadership also discovered she was cautioned by Hertfordshire Police on 29 January 2013 for sexual activity with a male aged 13 to 17.

The panel said a life-time ban was necessary in the public interest to maintain confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct.

Giving the final decision on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, Paul Heathcote said: 'Ms Bartlett has admitted all the allegations and that they amount to unacceptable professional conduct, and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute. The panel have concluded the same.

'Ms Bartlett's behaviour was a serious departure from the personal and professional conduct standards of the latest Teachers' Standards, and misconduct which affected the well-being of the pupil concerned.

'Ms Bartlett's actions involved abuse of a position of trust and was compounded by her initial denials on separate occasions to both the police and the school.'

He said the panel noted the testimonials in support of Ms Bartlett and found she has shown insight and remorse.

He continued: 'However, in view of the seriousness of this case, particularly the presence of sexual misconduct, I agree with the panel's recommendation that Ms Bartlett should be prohibited without the opportunity to have the sanction reviewed.'

The decision means that Bartlett is prohibited from teaching indefinitely in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England.

Bartlett, who was employed at the school  from September 2011 until March 2013, has a right of appeal to the High Court.
