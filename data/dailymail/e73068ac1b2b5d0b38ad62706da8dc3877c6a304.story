Yaya Toure is expected to lead the Ivory Coast out in their opening match against Guinea in the Africa Cup of Nations after declaring himself fit.

The 31-year-old didn't fully take part in the national team's first two practices at their Equatorial Guinea base, due to fatigue following a busy schedule with Manchester City.

However, the Ivory Coast captain trained on Monday allaying fears he would be unavailable for Tuesday's Group D encounter.

No player has assisted more goals at The African Cup of Nations since 2010 than Yaya Toure (four, level with John Obi Mikel.)

Toure goes into this fixture having scored in six of his last eight league games for club side Manchester City.

Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony was the top-scoring Premier League player in 2014 with 20 goals, while Toure was third with 17.

The Elephants have won nine and lost none of their last 11 Africa Cup of Nations group games, though they have not won the trophy since 1992.

The one previous meeting between these sides in this competition saw Ivory Coast win 5-0; Salomon Kalou bagged a brace in that game in 2008.

Guinea have gone eight games without a clean sheet in this tournament.

'At the moment, I'm good. It's just a case of being careful,' Toure said. 'I've been in a lot of games in the Premier League.'

Elephants coach Herve Renard concurred with his captain's sentiments adding that his absence has been a precautionary measure to ensure the midfielder is fresh.

'He has played a lot, notably between Christmas and New Year, for Manchester [City] and the most important thing is Tuesday,' Renard said.

Renard's side go into the tournament as one of the strong favourites to win the competition - with the likes of Kolo Toure, Wilfried Bony and Gervinho all on hand to play a pivotal role in their progression.

The Ivorians are without former captain Didier Drogba, who retired from international duty in August, but his successor Yaya Toure firmly believes the squad can finally live up to their potential by winning the competition for the first time in 23 years.

'We have been chasing this trophy for a few years now, and we've not got it,' he told Goal.

'This year it's time again to try to do it and I hope that at long last we have it in us. We can do it. I am fighting for it.'
