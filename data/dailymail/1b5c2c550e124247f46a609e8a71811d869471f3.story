Vladimir Putin's 'secret' daughter is an acrobatic rock 'n' roll-dancing businesswoman and scientist, according to a Moscow journalist.

Ekaterina Tikhonova, 28, is claimed to be one of Putin's two daughters who until now has been mystery figures to Russians, who are not allowed to see pictures of or know about the personal lives of the President's children.

It is claimed Putin's youngest daughter Ekaterina is using her mother's maiden name, Tikhonova, and has been put in charge of a £1.1billion expansion of Moscow State University.

Mystery girl: A Russian journalist claims Ekaterina Tikhonova, 28, is Vladimir Putin's youngest daughter

Scientist Ekaterina Tikhonova, has been put in charge of a £1.1 billion mega-expansion of Moscow State University, the country's most famous higher education institution

Journalist Oleg Kashin  suggests that in reality that she has a number of faces - as befits the daughter of a former KGB spy - including the vice president of the world confederation of Acrobatic Rock 'n' Roll.

A listing for dancer Yekaterina Tikhonova showed her birthday as 31 August 1986, the same date as Putin's younger daughter.

Her middle name or patronymic is Vladimirovna, indicating her father's name is Vladmir.

Tikhonova was also the Russian President's ex-wife Lyudmila's maiden name. 

Extraordinary footage has emerged of her enthusiastically high-kicking on the dance floor with male partner Ivan Klimov - but this is evidently not her only role, though it was sufficient to see the claims go viral.

Tikhonova attended this month's World Economic Forum in Davos along with other members of Russia's golden youth, the offspring of influential figures, it was claimed.

And she is in charge of the £1.1 billion expansion of Moscow State University (MSU), while serving as a member of the institution's scientific council.

She appears in a number of university pictures at official ceremonies but has not been acknowledged as Putin's daughter though she appears strikingly similar in looks to Lyudmila.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted saying: 'I do not know who she is. I cannot deny it, because I do not know.

'Until now, many girls said that they were daughters of Vladimir Putin'.

In a rare glimpse into his private life, Putin in November revealed both is adult daughters Maria and Yekaterina live in Russia - despite rumours they were domiciled abroad - but that he sees them only 'once or twice a month'.

During his time in power, he has refused to reveal any details of their lives.

Both are known to have attended a German international school in Moscow before quitting when he was appointed head of the FSB, the successor to the KGB.

Koshin's theory was not confirmed by the Kremlin last night, and why the claims appeared now - as Russia is hit by severe economic woes caused in part by Western sanctions - is unclear. 

The journalist even suggested she could emerge as Putin's successor.

'After fifteen years of hiding his daughter, he suddenly discovered that she is his last hope.

'There's no one else, and, apparently, no matter how much she wanted to dance, her biography will develop now according to the interests of the state,' he wrote.

Bloggers predicted Kashin would face a new attack, after already spending time in hospital after being beaten up several years ago.
