Jonathan Trott has signed a new three-year contract with Warwickshire after enjoying a revival in form and spirit this past season.

Trott, having quit England's Ashes tour of Australia last November citing stress and anxiety, made a delayed start to the campaign after a recurrence of the illness in April, but found form quickly after making his return for his county.

The 33-year-old piled up 1,156 runs across all three formats last season, helping the Bears finish as runners-up in the LV= County Championship and Royal London One-Day Cup, and making five centuries between July and September.

"Warwickshire CCC is a very special club for me and my family and I would like to thank everyone associated with the club for their support," Trott, who signed his first Warwickshire contract in 2003, said on the county's website.

"It has always been a great honour to represent the Bears and I am delighted to commit to the club once again for a further three years.

"Hopefully we can build on the success of this year by achieving greater success in the years to come."

Trott, who has played in 49 Tests for England, has not featured for the national team since leaving the Ashes tour, but said last month he hoped his recent form had put him back in the international frame, with his problems apparently behind him.

Since returning to action with Warwickshire in April, he has fired 1,156 runs and earned a new three-year deal

Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown is certain Trott still has the credentials to contribute for England, although he has been enjoying having him around at Edgbaston more than he is used to.

"Jonathan played some of the best cricket of his career in the second half of last season and he showed that he remains one of the leading batsmen in the English game," Brown said.

"It's been great to see him enjoying his cricket and make such a big contribution to the team's strong finish to the season. He loves Warwickshire and playing cricket at Edgbaston, and everyone connected with the club is thrilled to see him commit long term."
