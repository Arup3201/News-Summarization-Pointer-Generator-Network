The Institute Le Rosey has launched a major world-wide recruitment drive for new students 

The £80,000-a-year school is seeking students from Europe the middle east and north America

Officials from the school travelled to London last week in a bid to attract more students to the boarding school. 

The London event was one of a series of presentations across the globe with delegations heading to North America, Canada, Europe and the Middle East between now and March. 

Among the facilities on offer for the elite boarders, there is a 38ft yacht as well as a 1,000 seat concert hall. There is also an equestrian centre complete with 30 horses, allowing students to learn skills such as dressage as well as 

According to the school's website, 'Le Rosey’s campus is set in 28 hectares of magnificent landscaped grounds where age-old trees frame our buildings and sports facilities. This exceptional environment offers a full range of academic, sports and arts facilities.

'In each boarding house, teachers living with their families ensure discipline, tidiness and are available to listen to any problems, big or small that Roseans may be faced with in their day to day life.

'Le Rosey is committed to ongoing investment to continue to improve accommodation, teaching, sports and leisure facilities.'

The school is located approximately 20 miles outside Geneva with 179 en-suite bedrooms housing between one and three students.

 The students are taught in 53 class rooms and eight science laboratories. There are also specially designed rooms for music, orchestra, art and IT. 

In addition to 13 games rooms, there are two health centres. 

The school also features ten tennis courts, two 25-metre pools, three football pitches, rugby pitch, shooting range and archery. 

There is also a 'computer-regulated greenhouse. 

Students can also use a local 18-hole golf course and karting track. 

In winter, the school moves to the Gstaad ski resort. 

Headmaster Michael Gray told The Times: 'It happens with Swiss efficiency but is somehow mysterious. You go away for the holidays and come back to a different school.'

The school has a strict rule that no country can have more than 10 percent of the student population. 

Former pupils have included the Shah of Iran, King Albert II of Belgium and Prince Rainier of Monaco. 

Mr Gray added: 'No one goes around saying "I’m richer than you". It’s completely unsnobbish. If people put on airs and graces they wouldn’t survive. We had someone recently from a famous family, and after three days it didn’t work out and he left.'
