He is the Made In Chelsea lothario who's affectionately dubbed 'pug' by his co-stars and has a tendency to fall in love with (and then cheat on) most of the girls on the show.

But this season, Spencer promised us we would see a more sensitive side to the usually outspoken womaniser - even if he's yet to prove it.

Whether it's his pensive glances across the Thames or romantic French rambles, love him or hate him, Spenny is one of the reasons we keep tuning into the E4 show.

And now, reality TV's most notorious man about town has launched a blog with MailOnline, where he will be providing his own take on each episode and giving fans a glimpse into the glamorous life of SW3's resident Casanova.

Here, we bring you Spencer's first installment. Enjoy....

The author himself: Spencer Matthews has launched a brand new blog with MailOnline. 'Male Online' will delve deep into Spenny's innermost thoughts and give readers a glimpse into his glamorous lifestyle

Welcome to my first ever blog for the MailOnline. I am Spencer Matthews, best known for being on the E4 reality show Made In Chelsea, and the good people at DM online have kindly asked me to write a column entitled 'Male Online' (glad you see what they did there).

The other part of the masthead states: 'Out and About with Made In Chelsea’s Bad Boy'. Well I suppose I have picked up a bit of a reputation on the show, so 'Bad Boy' is to be expected – but hopefully you will get a better idea of my life over the next few weeks with a quick trip around my guide to modern living for the metrosexual male.

Welcome to his world: Along the journey we will be having a look at some of Spencer's favourite things: adrenalin sports, fine-dining, luxury travel, fast cars and some even faster women

Along the journey we will be having a look at some of my favourite things – adrenalin sports, fine-dining, luxury travel, fashion, male grooming, health, fitness, fast cars and possibly some even faster women.

For those of you who don't follow the Made In Chelsea show, it’s a BAFTA award winning TV programme that is now in its sixth series on E4. It’s all about the loves and lives of a group of young people who live in and around the SW3 area of London.

The show airs every Monday at 10pm on E4 for the next 12 weeks and I’m going to give you a running commentary of the main events just after it finishes at 11pm every Monday.

I’m also going to do other blogs which will consist of other aspects of my life outside of the show, and those will come out most Thursdays.

So here goes for my first blog about Made In Chelsea Series six, episode one.

The show opens with one of my psychotherapy sessions in Harley Street. At the end of the last series I had rather acrimonious split from my then-girlfriend Lucy Watson and was accused of having fidelity issues.

I thought it might be worth exploring these parts of my psyche in more depth and I have to say although I was nervous at first I feel as thought I get quite a lot from these sessions and continue to take them both on-and-off camera.

Describing myself as an entirely changed man isn’t yet hugely accurate but at least I am trying to change.

Slightly less therapeutic was when my ex Lucy Watson revealed on the show, that she thought I had cheated on her with at least four women.

Case of the ex: 'It was apparent from yesterday evening's show that Lucy Watson isn't going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating,' observes Spencer

Now, I have to say I’m glad this is all in the past now, and have since fully apologised to her for my behaviour. Perhaps I was on the rebound from my relationship with Louise Thompson, but real feelings did develop for Lucy Watson and I certainly didn’t want to hurt her.

But perhaps my wiser friends who warned me I was making a mistake rushing into another relationship so quickly were right after all.

It was apparent from yesterday evening’s show that Lucy Watson isn’t going to be repeating my mistake of serial dating.

She gave short shrift to a would-be new suitor at the pool-side party and the resulting scene was painful to watch. Lucy was approached by a young guy called Freddie asking her for a date.

She treated him to a dose of her trademark froideur, and then nerves got the better of the poor guy, he shook Lucy’s hand a couple of times too many and she shot him down in flames, much to Rosie Fortescue’s amusement.

My other ex, Louise doesn't seem to have had much luck over the summer either and has managed to lose five phones in swift succession.

Shares in Carphone Warehouse are in great shape as a result, but her relationship with Andy Jordan didn't appear to be doing quite so well.

I paid her a visit on a purely platonic basis at the end of the episode to see how she was bearing up after a fierce row, only to face accusations of getting involved in things that are none of my business. Well she’s still a good friend and I do care about her, so what’s the crime in that?

All that was left to do then was to have a nice atmospheric Steadicam shot of me walking through Sloane Square, whilst the credits rolled and the MIC theme tune 'Midnight City' by M83 played in the background.

Verge of tears: Louise Thompson's cordial chat with Lucy Watson

I genuinely believe this will be the best series yet. Welcome back to Chelsea everyone.

Lots of love, as always, Spencer. Xxx

PS – Catchphrase of the week comes courtesy of the wonderfully eccentric Francis Boulle. When questioned by Rosie of how he ended up naked in the pool, he coolly answered: 'Things happen'.
