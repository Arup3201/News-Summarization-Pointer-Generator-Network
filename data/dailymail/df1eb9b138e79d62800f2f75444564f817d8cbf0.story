It was a daring bid for freedom that could have come straight out of The Great Escape or The Colditz Story.

But the intrepid five who attempted to tunnel under a spike-topped 12ft metal fence using nothing more than pilfered cutlery were not plucky PoWs fleeing the Nazis – but Nottingham schoolboys trying to break out of their city academy.

If any of the youngsters tasted liberty, however, it was short- lived as the culprits were soon rounded up, and the already imposing security measures tightened up even further to thwart future escape efforts.

Their hole – dug in an out-of-the-way spot in fields within the grounds of Djanogly City Academy – has now been filled in, and a metal bar inserted to strengthen the fence, which was designed to ensure under-16s do not leave school grounds.

Acting headteacher Elaine Crookes said the pupils, thought to be all under 14, have been ‘spoken to’  and vowed: ‘Our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay in school.’

The school takes tough measures to combat truancy. As well the forbidding fence, its security also includes a ‘swipe-in’ system.

Tracey Phillipson, whose daughter is a Year 9 pupil, said: ‘The fencing with security signs all over it does make it look a bit more like a prison than a school and I guess to some pupils that’s a challenge.'

Assistant head Andy Roach wrote about the audacious breakout bid in an email to staff last week.

He said: ‘Regarding students digging a hole under the fence to escape... I have some updates.’

He said groundsmen had ‘filled in the hole and put a metal bar across the bottom of the fence in that area.

‘However, can staff on duty on the back field please keep an eye on them digging any more holes for this purpose in other areas along the fence.

‘Quite a lot of cutlery was found in the area, presumably stolen from the canteen  to aid their digging, so if staff on  the duty can keep an eye on students smuggling cutlery out of  the canteen...’

Housewife Jamila Khaliq, whose home backs onto the school playing fields, said of the escape bid: ‘I can’t believe they would even try such a thing. Since they put in the new fencing, we have all thought it was impossible for any pupil to get out.

‘It can be noisy in the back garden sometimes. I hear a lot of shouting and swearing – but never any digging.’

Former pupil Farzan Fazal, 20, described the school as ‘security mad’, adding: ‘They have even had  a marked car patrolling the area looking for truants. They give out fines if your child truants a lot.’

He added: ‘It would not be easy to dig a hole under that fence with a spade let alone a spoon.

‘When I was there in 2005, the fencing was smaller and we could slip out and go home for lunch. I guess that is what they were trying to do. Most secondary schools will let you go but Djanogoly has never allowed it. That’s why they built the bigger fencing.’

The school has now imposed tighter security measures after the bid for freedom - which could have come straight out of The Great Escape (above)

The school, which is in the deprived 
Hyson Green area of the city, is in ‘special measures’ after an 
inspection by the watchdogs Ofsted last year ruled it was ‘inadequate’.

It has suffered from high truancy rates, and pupils aged under 16 are not allowed out of the grounds without permission during the day.

Ofsted also noted in its report: ‘Students’ conduct, particularly outside lessons, shows a lack of respect for belonging to the academy.’

Ms Crookes said: ‘We can confirm that five pupils tried to leave the school at lunchtime by getting below the fence on the fields at our Gregory Boulevard site.

‘We have spoken to the students concerned, and taken action to repair the hole. That part of the fence has also been reinforced. Our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay safe and in school.’
