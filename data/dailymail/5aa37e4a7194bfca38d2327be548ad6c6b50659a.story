Philip Hammond has said critics of his defence cuts, including outgoing deputy supreme commander of Nato Sir Richard Shirreff, are 'talking nonsense'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday accused top generals of talking ‘nonsense’, following a fresh warning that spending cuts are weakening the Armed Forces.

In an interview yesterday General Sir Richard Shirreff warned that ministers were taking ‘one hell of a risk’ by replacing thousands of regular troops with part-time reservists.

Sir Richard, outgoing deputy supreme commander of Nato, said a series of cuts had left the Armed Forces ‘hollowed out’. He said the Royal Navy had been ‘cut to the bone’, leaving it unable to take part in some Nato operations.

His intervention is the latest in a series of warnings from senior military figures, both in this country and abroad. Mr Hammond insisted that the criticism was unfounded, pointing out that Britain still had the fourth largest defence budget in the world.

He also revealed that British forces will be deployed on Nato war games in the Baltic states to help ward off the threat posed by Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. ‘Nobody should be in any doubt of our resolve to live up to our commitments under the Nato treaty,’ he said. Asked if he was listening to the concerns of Sir Richard and others he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Of course I’m listening, and much of what I’m hearing is nonsense.’

Mr Hammond said Britain remained a ‘credible, capable and reliable’ ally to the US, despite a recent warning from former US defence secretary Robert Gates that defence cuts meant we could no longer be considered a ‘full partner’. ‘Of course we have had to make savings, of course we have had to take some very tough decisions,’ he said.

Mr Hammond acknowledged concerns about cuts to the Navy, which have left Britain without an operational aircraft carrier until 2020. He said the Navy would ‘like to have more assets’, but insisted it was still taking part in regular Nato operations.

Sir Richard’s criticisms are the most outspoken yet by a serving senior military figure. Although he stepped down from his Nato role at the end of last week he will remain the Army’s third most senior officer until he retires in August.

The Government plans to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 and replace lost numbers with up to 35,000 reservists

In an interview with The Sunday Times he raised concerns about the Government’s controversial plan to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020.

The so-called Army 2020 initiative involves trying to replace the lost capability by recruiting a 35,000-strong force of reservists. Over the same period, the Royal Navy and the RAF are each preparing to lose 5,000 regulars and gain 500 reservists.

Sir Richard said it was still unclear whether the plan ‘is going to work or not’ and added that recruiting reservists on such a scale would require ‘a complete shift in culture’ among commanders.

‘It’s certainly a hell of a risk,’ he said. ‘The point at which a risk becomes a gamble is a subjective view. I think the jury is still out.’

But he reserved his biggest concerns for cuts to the Navy.

‘A hollowed-out navy means you can’t project power,’ he said. ‘I’ve heard this said in the Ministry of Defence, “The yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight”. You can’t do that now. By that yardstick, therefore, we’re failing.’

In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: ‘With a restructured, more flexible and agile Army and with £160billion planned on new equipment over the next decade, we will ensure our Armed Forces retain their formidable range of capabilities and ability to project power across the globe.’
