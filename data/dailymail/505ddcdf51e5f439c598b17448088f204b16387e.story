He picked up the nickname Goldenballs for his skills on the football pitch.

But David Beckham  proved he is very very much the Goldenboy as he treated his family to a night out in London on Saturday.

Heading to a showing of Lord of the Dance at the Dominion Theatre, David, 39, was joined by his parents-in-laws Anthony and Jacqueline Adams, his mother Sandra and sister Joanne.

The family was without David's wife Victoria, who was hard at work promoting her new sunglasses range on a promotional tour of the Far East.  

Dressed in all black, David made a dapper appearance as he journeyed down the street making his way to the West End theatre.

Donning his trademark baker boy cap in brown, the retired football player cut a suave figure in a jumper, tailored trousers and leather boots.

Topping his ensemble with a black coat, the father-of-four continued to rock the bearded look as he walked with one hand in his pocket.

'Please keep him in your prayers. I love you dad, your son Michael.'
