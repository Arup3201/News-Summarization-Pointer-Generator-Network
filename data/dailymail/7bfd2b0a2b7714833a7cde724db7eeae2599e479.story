A metal worker in Florida claims he killed a burly co-worker with a shotgun out of self-defense after years of abuse.

Manuel Acosta, 69, is on trial in Miami-Dade for the shooting death of Jose Valdez, 50, in May 2010.

He's accused of reloading his shotgun repeatedly, firing at least 10 times. Two of the shots struck Valdez, killing him.

Defense attorneys argued that the 5-foot-3 Acosta, who weighed just 125 pounds at the time, had been punched and kicked for years by the 'giant' Valdez, who weighed some 423 pounds, the Miami Herald reported.

'To save his own life, Mr. Acosta was forced to kill Mr. Valdez,' said Lauren Krasnoff, a public defender,Â  told jurors, the paper reported.

Acosta and Valdez worked together at the San Judas Tadeo Foundry, a six-employee metal factory in the industrial town of 
Medley, Miami-Dade County.

Acosta had been at the factory for about 15 years, where he also lived in a trailer along with his four dogs. Valdez had been at the factory for four years and slept in a room inside a warehouse.

The older worker said Valdez 'became an abuser' who would bully him and his dogs.

The night of the attack, Valdez came after Acosta with a glass bottle and 'charged at him' while Acosta was cleaning his shotgun, defense lawyers claim.

Acosta 'fought for his life,' he told authorities.

But prosecutors say that, though Valdez was large, he was unarmed while Acosta pursued him 'like a hunter stalking his prey.'

'Jose Valdez was on the ground begging for his life,' said prosecutor Paige Saperstein, the Miami Herald reported.

The owner of the factory, Alfonso Vega, said Acosta had never complained about the use.

'They used to be talking every day, like normal people,' Vega told jurors, according to the Herald. 'They didn't argue every day.'

Acosta faces life in prison if convicted.
