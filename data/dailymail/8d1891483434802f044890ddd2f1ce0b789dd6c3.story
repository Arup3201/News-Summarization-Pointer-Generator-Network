A boy stranded 4,500 miles from home for more than a year because of his fear of flying has finally made it back to Britain.

Joe Thompson, 12, walked on to a plane and flew home yesterday after being hypnotised.

Joe and his father Tony had been forced to stay in the Middle East while the rest of their family came home to Britain because of his extreme phobia.

Fear: Joe Thompson, 12, pictured left, was so scared of flying he had to be hypnotised on the plane

Trauma: Joe, who had been stuck in the UAE for 18 months because of his fear, received therapy from hypnotist Russell Hemmings, left, who helped him deal with his anxiety

Anxiety: The schoolboy, who first moved to Abu Dhabi in 2009, became incredibly tense at certain points before the flight and so was helped by the therapist

After landing at Heathrow yesterday, Joe said: ‘I’m so happy to be home. I can’t believe how cold it is here.

‘I just want to get home and see my dog. I haven’t seen him for two years and I want to give him a big hug.’

Joe
moved to Abu Dhabi with his parents four years ago. He had been a 
confident flyer, but while in the United Arab Emirates, he developed a 
deep fear of flying, which made him unable to board a plane.

When
the family was due to return to Britain in June 2012, after his 
father’s job as manager of a private hospital came to an end, Joe found 
it impossible to fly.

He was so terrified as he approached the departure gate he would slump to the floor sobbing with stomach cramps.

Mr
Thompson, 62, an ex-aide to former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott,
said: ‘It just happened out of the blue and the fear is quite acute. He
was fine until he got to check-in and then he fell apart.

‘It was awful. He never talked about the plane crashing. He just said each time, “It’s the height”.’

Arrivals: Hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, left, Joe Thompson, centre, and Tony Thompson, right arrived back in the UK in the early hours of the morning

Emotional: Joe is reunited with his mother Pauline who had to move back to the UK in May for work

Stuck: Joe and his father Tony, pictured at their rented house in Al Ain, were trapped in the country for 18 months

There
was no income to support the family, so Joe’s mother Pauline, now 50, 
was forced to return to the family home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset 
with her daughter Chloe, 18, leaving Joe and his father behind in Abu 
Dhabi.

The Thompsons say 
they spent £40,000 on cancelled flights, on accommodation during their 
extended stay and on treatments to try to cure Joe’s fear of flying.

After
four attempts to get his son on a plane, Mr Thompson began planning an 
alternative journey by car through Saudi Arabia to Jeddah, where they 
would board a cargo ship to Europe, but they were blocked by visa 
complications.

After that Joe was treated by a number of specialists and psychiatrists without success.

But
earlier this year hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, a British ex-pat 
living in the neighbouring emirate of Dubai, contacted the family and 
offered to help.

After three
months of treatment, Joe finally plucked up the courage to board a 
Quantas flight from Dubai to Heathrow. Accompanied by Mr Hemmings and 
his father, he held his nerve and touched down yesterday at 5.30am UK 
time after a seven-and-a-half hour flight.

Just before boarding Joe began hyperventilating, but he relaxed after Mr Hemmings went through some deep breathing techniques.

He
then walked on to the plane with his father and the hypnotherapist. Joe
endured take-off by closing his eyes and meditating. During the flight,
he constantly watched films to distract himself.

Alternative: Mr Thompson, a former aide to former deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, tried to arrange for his son to board a cargo ship home last year, the route which he would have taken pictured

Temporary: The father and son relax in their rented accomodation in Al Ain, UAE, a few days before flying

Mr Hemmings, who did not charge the Thompsons, said: ‘I used a combination of hypnosis and cognitive behavioural therapy.

‘Joe
started having a meltdown at the airport, but we worked through it. On 
board I was able to calm him using hypnosis techniques. I had prepared 
for this flight weeks ago during our therapy sessions, using the power 
of hypnotic suggestion, meaning Joe already had the tools for success 
deeply planted into his subconscious mind. He just wasn’t necessarily 
aware of it.

‘Only in the 
most extreme cases of flying phobia would an accompanied flight be 
needed but Joe’s anxiety and panic was off the scale. I said it was 
possible to get him home and I’m thrilled I did it.’
