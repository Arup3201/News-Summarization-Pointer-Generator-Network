As the wife of Britain's Foreign Secretary she is used to meeting high profile politicians and even monarchs.

But Ffion Hague today appeared happy to share the limelight with Hollywood's most glamorous couple, at the final day of her husband's four-day conference with Angelina Jolie came to a close.

Mrs Hague joined  William, Miss Jolie and Brad Pitt in London for the closing speeches of the star-studded summit to end sexual violence against women in war.

Mrs Hague usually shuns publicity but has joined Mr Hague at a number of high profile events in recent weeks. 

She appeared alongside Mr Hague, the Tory Cabinet Minister,  with the Queen and the Duke of Edinbrough during the D-Day commemoration ceremony in Normandy earlier this month.

Today, at London's Excel centre, she seemed at ease, laughing and joking with Miss Jolie as the summit drew to a close with speeches by her husband and the US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Mr Hague and Miss Jolie have struck up an extraordinary friendship over the last few years.

The 39-year-old actress, who has six children with her film star husband, launched a campaign with Mr Hague in 2012 to fight sexual violence in war.

It came after she wrote and directed a film, called In the Land of Blood and Honey, in 2011 set during the Bosnian war. Up to 50,000 women were raped during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.

In 2012, the UN High Commissioner Antonio Guterres appointed Miss Jolie as his Special Envoy.

Today, after two years of campaigning, Miss Jolie and Mr Hague launched a new international protocol which they hope will 'shatter the culture of impunity' around sexual violence in war. So far, 155 countries have endorsed the declaration of commitment to end sexual violence in conflict.

Mr Hague said the event, which attracted delegations from 123 countries, would pave the way for more support for survivors of rape of warzones, and a commitment to bring perpetrators to justice as well as ‘raising awareness dramatically’ of the crimes across the world.

The Foreign Secretary said: ‘This has been an unprecedented event and a turning point in our campaign.’ He added that the summit was relevant to the crisis where there has been sexual violence on a ‘huge scale’.

Angelia Jolie said: ‘It sends an extremely powerful message to the world that the foreign ministers of the united kingdom and the united states are taking such a strong stand on this issue.

At times she has appeared emotional when listening to survivors of sexual violence in war

‘One of the most heartening aspects of this summit has been to see so many male leaders prepared to confront the taboo surrounding sexual violence in conflict. Indeed I believe one of the outcomes of this summit is that this subject is now firmly on the top table of international diplomacy and we will work to ensure that it stays there…it goes to the heart of international peace and security.’

Miss Jolie, closing the conference said the film was what brought her and Mr Hague together, leading them to co-chair the ESVC summit at the east London venue.

She said she was 'very moved' that the 2011 film, which is set in Bosnia during the conflict, was responded to by Mr Hague.

In her speech, the Oscar winner added: 'For me, and I suspect for many of you, this summit has been an emotional experience.

'We have all come together based on a common desire to end war zone sexual violence, and we have mapped out every area of action we need to take.'

The actress said there is 'no doubt' that after these four days it is now known what has to be done.

Miss Jolie said she will work with Mr Hague and others for 'as long as it takes' to prevail in the struggle of sexual violence in conflict.

She said the work begun at the summit is 'very, very much linked' with violence against women in other contexts, such as the kidnap of the schoolgirls in Nigeria or the recent rape cases in India and Pakistan.

Mr Hague described the last three days as 'remarkable', and said the summit has 'opened the eyes of the world to this issue'.

On the fourth day in a row Mr Hague has spent with Miss Jolie, he hailed the conference they had orgainsed and the impact it would have.

He said: 'I hope it is a moment we will look back on and say this was where we started to tip the tipping point, this was where we started to turn the tide, this was where we demonstrated to millions of people that it is possible to succeed in defeating and ending sexual violence in conflict.'

US Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the efforts of the Tomb Raider star and the Conservative politician.

He described Jolie, who is special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as a 'fierce and fearless advocate'.

'We've all watched her play many remarkable roles, but perhaps her most lasting legacy actually comes from a role she plays in real life - and that is the role of fierce and fearless advocate,' he said.

Speaking about Mr Hague, who he pointed out has travelled extensively and met those affected by sexual violence, Mr Kerry said: 'He has not just seen these unspeakable horrors, but he refuses to stay silent. That, my friends, is leadership.'
