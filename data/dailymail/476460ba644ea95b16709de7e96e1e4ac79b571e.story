The baby gorilla born by a rare animal C-section at a San Diego zoo last week is now fighting pneumonia.

The unnamed girl gorilla, who was born last Wednesday, underwent successful surgery for a collapsed lung on Friday, but fell ill over the weekend.

She is now under constant watch by veterinarians at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, who performed the emergency surgery after discovering the collapsed organ during a chest surgery.

The zoo says the 4.6lb female was born on Wednesday but seemed to have breathing problems hence the need for surgery

The gorilla, who weighed 4.6lbs when she arrived on Wednesday, was born with breathing problems.

â€˜It's
 not really clear if it [pneumonia] occurred just prior to birth or 
immediately following birth, but it's definitely pneumonia and a lot of 
the conditions that we've been managing since then are all related to 
pneumonia,â€™ Nadine Lamberski, veterinarian and associate director of 
veterinary services at San Diego Zoo, told the LA Times.

On
 Friday morning veterinarians, a neonatal specialist named Dawn Reeves 
and an anesthesiologist from the University of California, San Diego 
Health System performed the life-saving procedure, reports NBC.

NBC reported that after monitoring the 
baby, they determined that both her lungs were inflated and that the 
surgery was successful.

However, during the weekend, the baby girl contracted the serious lung infection.

Reeves
 told the Telegraph that the the baby gorilla is different than human 
babies because it can grab things with both its hands and feet.

Park officials say that the baby's 
mother, 18-year-old Imani, went into labor on Wednesday morning and was 
showing no signs of progress until later that evening.

NBC
 reports that's when doctors took Imani to the Safari Park veterinary 
hospital for an emergency operation, with the help of experts in human 
c-sections.

'In retrospect 
the c-section was the right decision,' said the parkâ€™s Associate 
Director of Veterinary Services Nadine Lamberski in a release.

'We think the health of the fetus would have been compromised if we delayed the surgery any longer.'

A cesarean delivery, also known as a c-section, is a 'surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision in the mother's abdomen and a second incision in the mother's uterus,' according to mayoclinc.com.

The operation was performed by the talented San Diego Zoo Global team and also by a veterinary surgeon and a neonatal specialist from UC San Diego medical Center.

She is currently in intensive care at a veterinary hospital after suffering complications during birth.

The little gorilla is being provided with oxygen and fluids and her mother is in the bedroom area.

The Mail Online tried contacting the park for updates on the gorilla's health but no one was available for comment.

This is Imani's first baby gorilla but the park's 17th.
