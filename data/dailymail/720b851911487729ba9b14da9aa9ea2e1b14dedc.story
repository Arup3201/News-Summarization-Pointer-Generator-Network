American airline Southwest is being fined $200,000 for false advertising.

Last October, Southwest advertised flights from Atlanta to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles for just $59 but then did not make any seats available at that price.

The American Department of Transportation (DoT) said that Southwest’s ads were deceptive and violated rules on advertising of airline fares.

Southwest was also ordered to pay an extra $100,000 that had been suspended after a similar offence last year.

The DoT commented that airlines already knew that as part of the rules governing fair fare advertising they must have a ‘reasonable number’ of seats available at the advertised price.

In October, Southwest ran advertisements on eight stations in the Atlanta region in which a voiceover intoned: ‘Discover amazing low sale fares’ of $59 ‘to places like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago’.

Officials from the DoT checked and found that on the travel dates listed in the commercial there were no $59 seats to those three cities.

Southwest blamed a flawed review of the advertising copy.

‘As soon as we became aware of our mistake, we pulled all incorrect advertisements off the air,’ said spokesman Brad Hawkins.

The airline said that it honoured the $59 fare to the three cities for consumers who called its reservations centre and asked for that price.
