The Premier League has been the loudest opponent of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar switching to a winter tournament — staged from November 21 to December 18 — that will be rubber-stamped at the FIFA ExCo meeting in Zurich on Friday.

But the richest league in world football is not expected to kick off yet again when the dates become official this week.

The PL is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and other European leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in Qatar which recommended a November-December competition.

Instead, the PL and their European counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar. The biggest confrontation is likely to be with their own UEFA confederation over tightening the Champions League programme. 

This not only spreads itself over a ridiculous four weeks for their last-16 round but also forbids domestic fixtures taking place on those nights.

The PL will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies, FA Cup replays and two-legged Football League Cup semi-finals in that season. But more conflict looks inevitable as the FA and Football League will not want their broadcasting deals affected by losing fixtures. However, a December 18 finish would see the Premier League restart on Boxing Day.

The Global Sporting Director Summit at the Etihad Stadium on April 29 has attracted former England cricket managing director Hugh Morris, who hardly put a foot wrong during his low-profile tenure that included three Ashes victories, as well as Paul Downton, who hasn’t put a foot right since taking charge in January 2014. 

If the beleaguered Downton were to take any advice from Morris he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time.

The Football League are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of News at Ten attention. Having been evicted by the Premier League, their new offices in London’s Gray’s Inn Road are next door to the ITV news studio in the ITN building. And the complex production role of supplying content from all three lower league divisions in time for the 9pm Channel Five highlights show next season will be handled by ITN.

Jason Leonard, RFU president from June, was surrounded by rugby fans on the Twickenham concourse before the Scotland game. It showed rugby definitely got one decision right — fast-tracking Leonard to be president during the World Cup, rather than some anonymous suit. And England Rugby 2015 will be making the most of Leonard being the Twickenham kingpin.

Moore’s tweet revenge

Only loveable BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore could go on Twitter seemingly to embarrass his own employers. Moore said on air that England scrum-half Ben Youngs was his choice as official BBC man of the match against Scotland. But Moore then went on social media to tell followers: ‘Just to point out I picked (Courtney) Lawes as MoM but Youngs came up and had to deal with it.’ A BBC spokesperson said the right graphic of Youngs was screened and was correctly announced and that Moore stood by his decision. No he didn’t on Twitter.

Former Chelsea and Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon is busy advising Premier League promotion hopefuls Middlesbrough, having brought in the club’s first foreign manager Aitor Karanka. He is also running global football funds with super agent Jorge Mendes. Jersey-based Kenyon is also playing an influential role as chairman of burgeoning rugby agency Esportif.

UEFA have put out a banal YouTube interview with president Michel Platini answering recorded questions that would have created derision if Sepp Blatter had done it. To Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas’ probing: ‘Mr President, I’d like to ask if you miss playing football?’ Platini replies: ‘Iker, it’s always a pleasure to see you on TV. Normally, when I see you, I give you a cup.’
