Tyson Fury's camp have apologised for cancelling Saturday's heavyweight clash with Alexander Ustinov.

Fury, who was originally scheduled for a bout with Dereck Chisora before his fellow Brit was forced to withdraw through injury, pulled out of the fight with Ustinov on Saturday morning after his uncle Hughie was taken to hospital.

And Fury's other uncle and trainer Peter has clarified the reasons behind the boxer's
 decision to withdraw from the fight.

Peter Fury told World Boxing News: 'On the afternoon of the 25th of July, I received a call just fter leaving the press conference for Tyson and Eddie Chambers' fight at the Phones 4U Arena in Manchester. My elder brother had gone for a routine operation to place a pin in his leg below the knee.

'The operation was a success as fully expected, however a blood clot developed due to having a cast on his leg and sadly it travelled through to his arteries making the situation far worse.

'Since the operation, Hughie has been in the intesive care unit at Lancaster royal Hospital where we are all by his side awaiting news. He is in critical, but stable condition at present and we are very worried.

'Hughie trained Tyson for both his fights with John McDermott and Dereck Chisora in the past and this situation has really affected Tyson and the whole family as we are praying for a positive outcome.

'We would like to thank everyone for all the nice messages of support and prayers for our family as they have been deeply moving and much appreciate. We are sorry to all the fans that we had to cancel the fights due to what is a terrible situation for all involved.

'As everybody knows, we are a very close family and nothing, absolutely nothing, comes before our brother and Tyson's uncle's well-being. We would also like to give special thanks to the doctors and staff at Lancaster Royal Hospital for their dedication in the work they do - especially in the ICU unit.' 

In a statement released by Queensberry Promotions, Hughie was said to be 'seriously ill' and Fury's camp therefore took the decision to 'pull him out of the fight rather than risk his health by sending him into the right with his mind not focused.' It is not clear what Hughie's condition is. 

Fury had only decided to take on Ustinov earlier this week after original opponent Dereck Chisora withdrew from Saturday's date after fracturing his hand in sparring. Ironically Chisora's injury came when he was sparring Ustinov. 

Warren said: 'I'm very, very, disappointed for the fans.  After Dereck Chisora pulled out because of his hand injury, we worked very hard to secure a world ranked opponent in Ustinov. 

'It's sad that his uncle Hughie is in a serious condition and our thoughts are with him. We will be announcing the rescheduled date for Chisora v Fury next week.'
