A schizophrenic man allegedly shot dead his neighbor because he believes he is a werewolf and his victim was a vampire, a forensic psychologist has testified this week.

Mark Andrews, 51, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to gunning down Colleen Barga-Milbury, 52, in May 2013 at her home in Atascadero, California. 

Psychologist Carolyn Murphy told the court on Tuesday that Andrews has suffered from schizophrenia since 1993 and had psychotic episodes.

'(He believes) he transforms into a werewolf,' Ms Murphy said,  KSBY reported. 'He believes he holds the spirit of the wolf.'  

Mark Andrews has pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity for the May 2013 murder of Colleen Barga-Milbury. Andrews (pictured in court this week) has suffered from schizophrenia for the past 20 years

Murdered: Colleen Barga-Milbury, 52, was shot in the hip and leg and found dead in the entry of her home in May 2013. Neighbor Mark Andrews is now on trial for her murder

The prosecution does not dispute Andrews is mentally ill but that he was sane at the time of Barga-Milbury's murder. 

Mrs Barga-Milbury was shot twice - once in the hip and once in the leg. Her body was found by her 16-year-old son, who came from school to find her lying dead in the entryway of their home. 

The psychologist said she interviewed Andrews for about five hours.

She said Andrews believed the voice of God commanded him to kill Barga-Milbury. 

He was convinced Barga-Milbury was a vampire, said Murphy who testified as a defense witness.

She told the court that Andrews would follow what the voices in his head told him to do and that he had been hospitalized eight times for his mental issues. 

Deputy District Attorney Matt Kraut produced a rifle to the jury that was the same make as the one used to shoot  Barga-Milbury.

Evidence: Deputy District Attorney Matt Kraut produces a gun similar to the one allegedly used by Mark Andrews to twice shoot the victim, killing her

Kraut said medical reports showed the gun was about 24 inches from the woman's head when she was shot, showing Andrews had plotted her death.

'He was on point,' Kraut told the court. 'He was organized. He was not psychotic. 

'And that's exactly how he was when he killed colleen in the entry way of her own home – in cold blood.'

According to the San Luis Obispo Tribune, Kraut said Andrews had several interactions with people before the murder who did not report finding anything amiss with his behavior.

The police who interviewed Andrews after Barga-Mulbury's death described his as stable, as did a treating psychiatrist and jail staff.

However court records show that, in 2009, Andrews believed a different neighbor was a vampire.

He left mounds of dirt and flour on the woman's front porch.

He once also pounded on her door, screaming she was a 'b----'.

The court was also played a video recording of Andrews telling his mother: 'I just want to be executed and die.'

A jury of six men and six women are now deliberating.

Closing arguments finished on Thursday afternoon.
