At first glance, it looks like a vintage map of the world.

However, this amazing image actually shows the online world - with the most popular websites replacing the traditional countries.

Created by Slovakian artist Martin Vargic, it is based on the iconic National Geographic maps of the world - but with a modern twist.

Created by Slovakian artist Martin Vargic, the 'Map of the Internet' is based on the iconic National Geographic maps of the world - but with a modern twist.

However, Vargic said he limited himself to just the most popular sites online - including MailOnline - for the project.

'Due to the immense size of the Net, only a miniscule portion of it was chosen to represent it on the map - otherwise, this map would be unreadable and probably undrawable in entire lifespan of average human being,' Vargic told MailOnline.

He now hopes to improve the map over time, adding more sites.

'I started making maps about 2 and half years ago, and it has quickly become my free-time hobby,' he said.

'It was my hobby, and it still is my hobby, though I am planning to start selling prints of my maps on Amazon quite soon.

'I was originally inspired by map of the internet created by xkcd, showing most popular social networks as countries and regions, back in 2010,' he said.

Most of the map was created in Photoshop, with special software used to create the ornate borders.

'This poster includes one full map of the internet, 4 minimaps showcasing NSA surveillance, most used social networks, most used internet browser, and worldwide internet penetration, list of Alexa Top 500 websites, quick timeline of the Internet History, top software companies and much more,' he boasted.

He now plans to keep improving the map, adding more and more sites, and said the original only took him three weeks.

'I often worked early in the morning, and I can say I really enjoyed it.

'Currently, I am working on the next versions of the map, which will be even more ridiculously detailed than the previous one, and will encompass all major websites without any significant exceptions.'
