An interim report into  missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is due to be released on March 7 - the day before the anniversary of its disappearance.

Deputy transport minister Aziz Kaprawi confirmed the report by Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation will carry details on the 'technical investigation' into the missing plane which vanished over the Indian Ocean on March 8 in 2014 with 239 people on board.

More than 9,000 square kilometres of ocean floor has since been searched but no sign of the missing aircraft has been found.

An international investigation team, with members from US, China, Britain, France and Australia, was set up in April 2014 to search for MH370. Their findings will be included in the report which is a requirement from the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for Malaysia. 

Investigators  say they could finish scouring the priority search zone by May, more than a year after the plane vanished, if there are no delays with vessels, equipment and weather.

The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) said decisions about the future of the search would continue to be made in collaboration between Malaysia, China and Australia.

Last month, families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing provided DNA samples to assist in identifying loved ones once the plane was found.

Lead search agency, Australian Transport Safety Bureau, ATSB, released a sonar acoustic image of the ocean floor to show what search vessels are recording as teams continue to scour the Indian Ocean. 

The latest JACC update said the survey vessel Fugro Equator was continuing to map the ocean floor.

More than 9,000 square kilometres of the ocean floor has been searched to date and about 200,000 square kilometres of the search area has been surveyed, according to the ATSB.

The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is an arc 60,000 square kilometres in size - 1,800km off the west Australian coast.

Fugro Discovery arrived back in the search area on December 4, while GO Phoenix returned last Tuesday, and both have recommenced underwater search operations.

Last month grieving family members of Chinese passengers from a missing Malaysia Airlines flight protested outside the foreign ministry in Beijing Friday accusing the government of failing to provide them with regular updates on the search for the aircraft.

Chinese passengers account for about two-thirds of the 239 people who were aboard the Boeing 777, which vanished on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to China's capital. 

Malaysia Airline's crisis worsened on July 17 last year when another jet,
Flight MH17, was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people
on board.

Flight MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

Rounding out a bad year for Southeast Asian carriers, an
AirAsia flight from Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya
to Singapore crashed in December, killing all 162 people on
board.
