Giant robots have invaded China.

But never fear, it's not the start of some alien takeover or hi-tech world war, it's just a Hollywood publicity stunt.

The man behind the multi-billion dollar Transformers movie franchise, Bay, 49, has sent his fleet of Autobots on a tour of the country to drum up interest in the fourth installment of the series.

Big, brash and full of explosions, the Transformers movies - which have taken more than $2.6billion at the global box office - embody American cinema's gonzo inclinations.

It is a hugely popular franchise in China. When the last film was released 2011, it raked in $177.3 million and holds the record as the second highest grossing foreign film ever screened - after James Cameron's Avatar.

Three of the key robots from the films - Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Sentinel Prime - are travelling around China and have been pictured today in Shenyang, in the northeast of the country.

Standing at more than 15ft tall, the models cut imposing figures as they tower over local buildings.

China plays a key role in the new film, with part of the film's funding coming from Chinese financiers and several sequences being filmed in the region.

Transformers: Age of Extinction will be released in the UK on July 10.
