Ralph McQuarrie, the artist who developed the look of the first Star Wars trilogy's signature characters, sets and spaceships, has died, aged 82.

McQuarrie's death Saturday at his Berkeley home was announced on his official website and Facebook page.

John Scoleri, co-author of a book on McQuarrie's art, told the LA Times that McQuarrie had suffered from Parkinson's disease.

Famous: Ralph MrQuarrie was best known for his Star Wars designs

In a statement on the official Star Wars website, George Lucas said McQuarrie was the first person he hired to help him envision what would become some of the top-grossing movies of all time.

'His genial contribution, in the form of unequaled production paintings, propelled and inspired all of the cast and crew of the original Star Wars trilogy,' Lucas said.

'When words could not convey my ideas, I could always point to one of Ralph's fabulous illustrations.'

In a 2011 interview with the Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph, McQuarrie said his work on Star Wars was 'a special opportunity to start from the ground up.

'Being able to create new characters, vehicles and different worldsâ€¦and since when I started it wasn't even clear that the film would be made, I didn't have to limit myself.'

He and Lucas would meet every few weeks, McQuarrie recalled, and 'he would explain what he was looking for and leave me to my work.

'Next visit, we would go over my drawings and discuss any changes. We had a very good working relationship.'

McQuarrie's original concepts included the look of some of pop culture's most recognizable characters, including Darth Vader, C-3P0 and R2-D2.

He also created the look of the Stormtroopers and the lightsaber.

Experienced: McQuarrie worked as a technical illustrator at Boeing before his career in the film industry took off. He saw combat in the Korean War and survived a bullet that pierced his helmet.

Other movies to which McQuarrie contributed concept illustrations included Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.

He won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on the 1985 film Cocoon.
