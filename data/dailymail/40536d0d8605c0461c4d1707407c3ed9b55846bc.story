A mystery fish with terrifying tusk-like spikes near its mouth and spines along its body has been caught off the coast of Borneo.

The discovery has baffled fisherman in the area and the authorities are also scrabbling to identify the foot-long species.

Locals have temporarily named it the Armour Fish, courtesy of its sharp spines on the top and bottom of its body, which gets progressively smaller towards the tail.

Anyone for supper? This frightening fish, complete with tusk-like spikes and spines along its body has been caught in the South China Sea off Borneo

Who's NOT a pretty boy, then? The Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation Division of Sarawak Forestry Corporation is currently looking into identifying the creature

Angler Sapar Mansor, 43, from Taman Ceria, Permyjaya, caught the fish in the South China Sea near Tudan, Malaysia.

He told the Borneo Post: 'This is the first time in my life that I have seen this type of fish. I brought it home to my wife and informed her of the rare catch.

Sapar said he and a friend went out in a fishing boat and travelled two hours from Miri River to the sea.

They started fishing at around 5am and landed his surprising catch about an hour after arriving at a location many miles from Miri.

Brave: Siti Kadariah, the wife of the angler who caught the fish, and their daughter with the creature at home. They have temporarily named it the Armour Fish thanks to its sharp spines

The Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation Division of Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) is currently looking into identifying the creature.

Oswald Braken Tisen, the deputy general manager, said: 'SFC has not been able to established what kind of fish it is but is in the process of checking with relevant authorities.'

Sapar's wife Siti Kadariah and his children have taken to calling the creature 'Armour Fish' for now thanks to its sharp spines.

Siti, 35, added: 'My husband caught this rare species and I was surprised to see the fish.

'When my husband brought the fish home, both my children were stunned because of its shape and uniqueness.'

Siti has decided to dry the fish so that it can be preserved and kept at their home.

'It is God's gift and I and my family will keep the fish,' she added.
