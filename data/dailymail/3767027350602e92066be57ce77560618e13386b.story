One in 10 London homeowners face spending hundreds of pounds every few years on property valuations because of Ed Miliband’s plan to introduce a ‘Mansion Tax’, it has been revealed.

The Labour leader has vowed to impose a levy of up to £15,000-a-year on homes worth over £2million in order to shore up the NHS.

More than 100,000 homeowners could be hit immediately by the tax, which is expected to be a levy of 1 per cent.

But thousands more families - the vast majority in London - could be forced to pay for valuations of their homes by surveyors because of Britain’s volatile housing market which can see increases of over 20 per cent in a year.

House prices are soaring by more than 10 per cent a year, which could drag more and more properties into the 'mansion tax' band

Mr Miliband says the tax will raise £1.3 billion, which will be used to hire thousands of NHS staff.

But some 250,000, just under one in 10 of households in the capital, will be forced bring in surveyors to assess whether their property exceeds £2million, according to experts at Knight Frank estate agents.

They will also face fines of thousands of pounds if the taxman disagrees with the valuation they submit.

Labour has insisted it will not introduce a wholesale revaluation of properties to see how many multi-million pound properties are being bought and sold.

Instead, the party is considering a similar scheme to the one developed by George Osborne to target super-rich individuals who buy large houses through businesses, avoiding stamp duty.

Mr Osborne’s scheme means those who buy houses through companies have to report to the taxman what the house is worth, with those over £500,000 subject to a tax.

A penalty of 30 per cent of the tax owed is imposed if the wrong amount is declared through ‘carelessness’, rising to 100 per cent if it was deliberate.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said a mansion tax would raise almost £2 billion which would be used to hire tens of thousands of NHS staff

But critics have raised concerned that thousands risk could be forced to pay the tax unfairly because estate agents are inflating the asking prices of homes.

Under Mr Osborne's scheme valuations must be undertaken every five years.

A senior Labour source said shadow chancellor Ed Balls was looking at using a ‘similar model’ to Mr Osborne’s.

Yesterday it emerged pensioners hit by the levy could see the money taken out of their estates when they die.

Elderly homeowners who do not have the income to pay up front could defer the tax until their death.

It would mean that their families could be faced with bills running to tens of thousands of pounds.

Only a tiny number of people are expected to be exempted from the tax which, it is feared, could hit the so-called ‘asset-rich, cash-poor’ homeowners who live in properties whose value has soared in recent years but do not have the ready money to pay the levy.

Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, told the BBC that one solution would be to offer ‘relief’ to some long-term residents or allow them to ‘defer payments until the property was sold’.

A string of prominent London-based Labour MPs have already come out against the levy – which they see as a ‘tax on the capital’. And Labour’s candidates for London Mayor have also opposed the measure, which would disproportionately affect London.

Yesterday Lord Adonis criticised the proposal, saying: ‘People whose houses have been inflated into much higher values and suddenly find themselves therefore facing a much higher tax bill, many of whom will not be people of means, we need to play fair by them too.’

Labour say the £2 million threshold will rise each year in line with house price inflation, and the level will be banded so the most expensive properties are levied the most.

One estate agent said the policy would suppress the value of homes close to the £2 million threshold.

The policy has alarmed MPs in the capital. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said there was a "big question" around how houses would be valued. "If [it is] on current value, then London pensioners living in same home for years will be hit hard," he said.
