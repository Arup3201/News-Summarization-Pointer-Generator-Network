Louis van Gaal admits that he would love to have Cristiano Ronaldo back at Manchester United but does not think Real Madrid would sell the Portugal star.

Ronaldo spent six years at Old Trafford before moving to the Bernabeu in a world record £80million move in 2009, and the current World Player of the Year would cost a similar fee to buy back if he decided to leave Real.

The 29-year-old has been linked with a return to the Premier League amid speculation that he is unhappy at the European champions for letting a number of top players leave this summer – including Angel di Maria, who joined United for a British transfer record of £60m.

Asked if he would take Ronaldo back to United, Van Gaal said: ‘When it is possible, what I said with Falcao, players like Ronaldo give a lot extra to a team, but I don’t think Real Madrid shall sell him.

‘It’s always a discussion in the papers and I don’t think the media shall buy Ronaldo.’

If Ronaldo does make a sensational return to United, Van Gaal would have another option to bolster his front line.

The United manager said on Friday that Wayne Rooney is the only guaranteed starter among his front men. 

And when asked about how Radamel Falcao could play with Robin van Persie, the Dutchman was quick to praise both of his options.

'I don't think Falcao interferes with Van Persie or Van Persie interferes with Falcao. 

'Falcao is a very good striker and in his first press conference I said that I like Van Persie also, he is also a very good striker.

'We have Rooney, Janzaj and Wilson. We have five players for two positions and I have to choose.'
