It is 'very unlikely' that a man being tested for Ebola at New York City’s Mount Sinai Hospital has the deadly virus, it was reported on Monday night.

Mount Sinai’s Chief Medical Officer Jeremy Boal said: 'It’s much more likely that it’s a much more common condition, and we’re ruling those things out as well.'

The full test results are expected to be released today or Wednesday.

The patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room early on Monday morning with ‘a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms,’ according to a hospital statement.

New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital is treating a sick male patient who recently returned from a West African country where the Ebola virus has been reported. Doctors late on Monday said it is 'very unlikely' he has the disease

He had recently returned from a West African country where the Ebola virus has been reported.

The patient has been isolated and is undergoing diagnostic testing for Ebola but also for other illnesses that could cause his symptoms.

‘All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff,’ the hospital said.

‘We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients.’

The Department of Health also released a statement stating that the patient is unlikely to have the deadly disease.

'After consultation with CDC and Mount Sinai, the Health Department has concluded that the patient is unlikely to have Ebola. Specimens are being tested for common causes of illness and to definitively exclude Ebola,' read the statement.

Another patient was isolated at a hospital in the city last week after arriving on a flight from West Africa and showing symptoms found in Ebola patients.

That man 
was screened at Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday night and 
taken to Bellevue Hospital. He had a fever, but within a day the fever 
had gone away and it became clear that he did not have Ebola, reports 
the New York Times.

'We are on a heightened state of alert,' said Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.

'We have instructed all 11 of our hospitals to follow C.D.C. guidelines and be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms.'

Meanwhile Nancy Writebol, the American aid worker with Ebola, landed in Maine early this morning for her plane to refuel before being moved to the Atlanta hospital where she will be treated.

Federal agents at U.S. airports are watching travelers from Africa for flu-like symptoms that could be tied to the recent Ebola outbreak, as delegations from some 50 countries arrive in the nation's capital for a leadership summit this week.

Border patrol agents at Washington's 
Dulles International and New York's JFK airports in particular have been
 told to ask travelers about possible exposure to the virus and to be on
 the lookout for anyone with a fever, headache, achiness, sore throat, 
diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash or red eyes.

Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, 
which will receive several African heads of state, is screening 
passengers too, while U.S. Secret Service agents in charge of security 
for the three-day summit have been briefed on what to look for and how 
to respond, officials said on Monday.

If a passenger is suspected of carrying the deadly virus, they would be quarantined immediately and evaluated by medical personnel, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provided the additional training to local airports.

'There is always the possibility that someone with an infectious disease can enter the United States,' CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said on Monday. 'The public health concern is whether it would spread, and, if so, how quickly.'

The Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever that has stricken more than 1,600 people, killing at least 887 of them in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

The virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or urine, unlike an airborne virus like influenza or the common cold.

A person exposed to the virus can take 
up to 21 days to exhibit any symptoms, making it possible for infected 
travelers to enter the U.S. without knowing they have it.

While the CDC says it is not screening passengers boarding planes at African airports - the job of local authorities there - the center said it has encouraged vulnerable countries to follow certain precautions.

Outbound passengers in the countries experiencing Ebola are being screened for fevers and with health questionnaires, Reynolds said.

Health officials say the threat to Americans remains relatively small, even with the uptick in travel this week between Africa and the United States.

In the past decade, five people have entered the U.S. known to have a viral hemorrhagic fever, including a case last March of a Minnesota man diagnosed with Lassa Fever after traveling to West Africa. Reynolds said in all five instances, U.S. officials were able to contain the illness.

A vaccine against Ebola has been successfully tested with monkeys, and there is hope it could become available as early as next July, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CBS This Morning on Monday.
