Shares in Greek banks crashed by more than a quarter yesterday as Athens urged Berlin not to go on humiliating a ‘proud nation’.

Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s new finance minister, issued an extraordinary defiant statement invoking the rise of the Nazis when Germany was crippled by debts between the wars.

After a tense meeting with his German counterpart in Berlin, Wolfgang Schaeuble, he declared: ‘We didn’t even agree to disagree.’

Tension: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (right) asked Germany's Wolfgang Schauble to bring to an end the 'gross indignity' that his country is enduring as they battle a debt crisis

Markets took fright after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would no longer accept Greek government bonds in return for lending – an aggressive move which last night prompted large protests on the streets of Athens.

The ECB’s stance forced the Greek central bank to provide tens of billions of euros in emergency funding to the country’s banks.

Shares in Greek lenders slumped by as much as 28 per cent at the news and analysts warned the risk of the country crashing out of the EU was now greater than at the height of the last crisis in 2012. 

Mr Varoufakis, whose far-Left party Syriza swept to power last month, compared Greece’s plight to that of inter-war Germany.

Denial: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already made it clear that her country is determined to oppose to any reduction to the Greek debt

Germany was crippled by huge debts after the First World War and experienced hyperinflation, wrecking its economy. Its financial woes helped fuel the rise of Hitler.

Mr Varoufakis said: ‘If you humiliate a proud nation for too long and subject it to the worry of a debt deflation crisis, without light at the end of a tunnel then things come to the boil.’ He warned about the rise of Greece’s neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, which came third in the country’s general election.

‘It is one of history’s greatest ironies that Nazism is rearing its ugly head in Greece,’ he said.

Mr Schaeuble, speaking after the talks, ruled out any possibility of writing off a chunk of Greece’s debts, which stand at more than £240billion.

He said Greece ‘belonged in the euro’, but added: ‘Some of the measures the new government announced ... don’t necessarily go in the right direction in our view.’

Syriza was elected on a promise to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s bailout, seeking a 50 per cent debt write-off.

Mr Schaeuble claimed he and Mr Varoufakis had ‘come much further than anyone expected’.

Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras pledged to ‘put an end once and for all’ to the EU’s austerity policies. ‘Greece is no longer the miserable partner who listens to lectures to do its homework. Greece has its own voice.’

Tour: Mr Varoufakis this week met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne as the new Greek leaders tour Europe seeking support for a new debt deal

Speaking on a visit to Leeds, Chancellor George Osborne said the stand-off was now the largest threat to the British economy.

‘We’ve known from our recent experience we are affected when there is instability in the Eurozone so it’s in our interests to come to an arrangement,’ he said.

Greece’s Attica Bank recorded the biggest single loss, down 28 per cent at one stage. Piraeus Bank, the biggest lender, fell 27 per cent and National Bank of Greece 26 per cent.

Giuseppe Maraffino, an analyst at Barclays, said: ‘The probability of a Greek exit is clearly now higher than at any time in 2012.’
