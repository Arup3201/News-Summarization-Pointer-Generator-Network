This was the scenario Brendan Rodgers must have feared as the Liverpool team bus drove away from Selhurst Park on Monday night.

Watching Manchester City beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park last Saturday, Rodgers detected nerves — some fatigue — in the ranks of his Barclays Premier League rivals.

There was, the Liverpool manager thought, something left to play for this season.

In south London, though, all that changed. It changed the league table but, more importantly, it changed the context, the whole feel, of this occasion on Wednesday night.

Liverpool’s late capitulation against Crystal Palace afforded City vital breathing space and Rodgers knew it. Here in the rain at the Etihad Stadium, Manuel Pellegrini’s team moved into that space and breathed hard. For a while, they had to.

This was an unconvincing effort for long periods from the champions-elect. They scored four goals in the end and it’s a round 100 for the League season now. Some effort, that.

Three of those goals came late here, though. They came once the pressure valve had been released by Edin Dzeko’s goal in the 64th minute.

Prior to that, City had an awful lot of possession and didn’t do an awful lot with it. As Rodgers sensed, they looked tired and uncertain. In drawing at Palace, however, Liverpool had left the wriggle room they needed.

Although City laboured hard for an hour, it never got that tense. The nerves never jangled. They didn’t have to. A draw would have been enough, given City’s goal difference advantage and, on the whole, Aston Villa never looked like scoring. So, in the end, City won the game and they won it well. Now they will win the title and deservedly so.

Any team — no matter how many championships they have won — will feel the pressure when the season nears its end. The simple things become a little less simple, decision-making becomes more complicated and less instinctive. Had Liverpool not erred so spectacularly at Palace on Monday, they may have seen evidence of this in their rivals. They would have witnessed experienced international footballers begin to doubt themselves.

As it was, City bumped along the road to victory without conviction, but also without any great fear that things were about to go badly wrong.

Pellegrini never took anything for granted. In his programme notes, the Chilean called on his club’s supporters to help out. Against Sunderland here last month, City’s fans had been dreadfully flat and Pellegrini believed his team suffered as a result that night.

For a long time here, though, it was hard for the supporters not to betray some misgivings. City began slowly, nervously, and grew steadily worse for  an hour.

Not until the last minute of the opening half did we think they had scored, Samir Nasri somehow diverting James  Milner’s cross from the right wide of goal.

City looked leaden-footed and lacking in pace for long periods. David Silva and the endearing Pablo Zabaleta worked well together but, that apart, inspiration was hard to come by.

Some of these players were involved when Roberto Mancini’s City team squeaked home against Queens Park Rangers on the final day two seasons ago. Maybe they felt the chill of the flashback before kick-off.

Unfortunately for those who were seeking a little unexpected drama, Villa were a side safe from harm. As such, nothing much was expected of them, certainly not by Rodgers and Liverpool, and Paul Lambert’s men surprised nobody.

Until the first goal, Villa were energetic and organised and committed. They offered hardly anything when they had the ball, though. It is problem that has plagued Villa boss Lambert all season and it bothered him again on this occasion.

Twice in the first half Villa did break with intent. On both occasions, though, they were betrayed by finishing that lacked confidence.

As he watched at home,  Rodgers must have suffered. He always knew that City were far from certain to win their final two games.

He also knew, however, that neither Villa nor West Ham would beat them, not at this stage of the season.

Ultimately, City’s goals came in a rush. The last 20 minutes resembled the start of a title party. Yaya Toure’s last-minute goal was wonderful.

Had they really needed those goals, they may not have arrived. Pressure, real pressure, does odd things.

What will haunt Rodgers all summer is that he never gave City that problem.
