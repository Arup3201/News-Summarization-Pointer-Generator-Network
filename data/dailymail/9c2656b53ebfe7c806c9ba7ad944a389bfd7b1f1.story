Quentin Tarantino is suing Gawker Media for allegedly disseminating a copy of his script for prospective new film The Hateful Eight.

The 50-year-old director filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging 
contributory copyright infringement after Gawker's Defamer blog posted a link to another site with the caption: 'Here Is the Leaked Quentin Tarantino Hateful Eight Script.'

The Oscar-winning screenwriter was so furious at the leak, which happened last week, that he threatened to halt production on The Hateful Eight, described as a 70mm ensemble Western.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Tarantino's complaint states: 'This action is necessitated by Gawker Media’s, and the other defendants’, blatant copyright infringement by their promotion and dissemination of unauthorized downloadable copies of the leaked unreleased complete screenplay for Quentin Tarantino’s motion picture The Hateful Eight.

'Gawker Media has made a 
business of predatory journalism, violating people’s rights to make a 
buck. This time they went too far.

'Rather than merely publishing a news 
story reporting that Plaintiff’s screenplay may have been circulating in
 Hollywood without his permission, Gawker Media crossed the journalistic
 line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the 
entire Screenplay illegally.'

The lawsuit then complains about the use of 'multiple direct links' to an 'anonymous URL' which were posted via Defamer and also on the Gawker website. It criticises Gawker's invitation for the reader to 'enjoy' reading the script.

It further alleges that Gawker ignored repeated requests to remove the links to the screenplay.

In a response to the allegations, Gawker published a post on Monday refuting any suggestion they 'leaked' the script 
themselves. They claim they were merely reporting that the 
screenplay existed on two different websites.

Gawker mention that Tarantino himself told Deadline in an interview that he 'likes' his scripts to be available for fans to critique on the Internet, although admittedly, the Deadline piece states that the director 'can't believe' it happened this early in the film making process.

'I am not talking out of both sides of my mouth, because I do like the fact that everyone eventually posts it, gets it and reviews it on the net,' the director told Deadline. 'Frankly, I wouldn’t want it any other way. I like the fact that people like my s***, and that they go out of their way to find it and read it. But I gave it to six motherf***** people! Starting this week, I’ll be setting meetings with publishers.'

Gawker also alleges the leaked script is part of a 'shrewd publicity' strategy' by the director and insists it 'published a link to the script because it was news.'

They add: 'The leak of The Hateful Eight - and
 the content of the script - had been widely dissected online and was a 
topic of heated conversation among Defamer readers.

'News of the fact 
that it existed on the internet advanced a story that Tarantino himself 
had launched, and our publication of the link was a routine and 
unremarkable component of our job: making people aware of news and 
information about which they are curious.'

Gawker are also vehement they had 
'nothing to do with the appearance of The Hateful Eight script on the 
internet' and have 'no idea' how the websites in question got hold of the 
script.

Tarantino told Deadline last Tuesday that he was 'very very depressed' about the leak.

'I finished a script, a first draft, and I
 didn’t mean to shoot it until next winter, a year from now. I gave it 
to six people, and apparently it’s gotten out today,' he said.

He found out about the leak when his agent started fielding calls from representatives looking to tout their clients for a role in the film.

'I gave it to one of the producers on 
Django Unchained, Reggie Hudlin, and he let an agent come to his house 
and read it,' Tarantino said.

'That’s
 a betrayal, but not crippling because the agent didn’t end up with the 
script. There is an ugly maliciousness to the rest of it. I gave it to 
three actors: Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth. The one I know 
didn’t do this is Tim Roth.

'One of the others let their agent read it, and that agent has now passed it on to everyone in Hollywood.'

According to The Wrap,
 actors Christoph Waltz  was being courted for a role, but was never 
given the script. Neither was Samuel L. Jackson, one of the Pulp Fiction
 writer's favourite collaborators.

Tarantino said he suspects the leak came from Dern's agency, CAA. However, a representative for the agency 'vehemently denied' any involvement when asked by Deadline, pointing out that the script lacked the customary watermark used for security purposes.

The Django Unchained screenwriter then said he would publish the script and revisit it down the road as a potential movie.

'I’ll move on to the next thing. I’ve got 10 more where that came from,' he said about his next possible project.

Tarantino's next project may be a prison film, according to The Wrap, who reported that he has been researching details about actor Robert Blake's acquittal for the murder of his wife Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001.

The site also states that the prolific writer is still interested in making a film starring Bruce Dern.
