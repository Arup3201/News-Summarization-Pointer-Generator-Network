A jealous and controlling boyfriend brutally battered his partner to death just days after she refused to have a sexual threesome with him and a male friend, a court heard today.

Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, was stabbed with a kitchen knife by Muhammad Shafi  then had her skull 
shattered with a pair of metal shears, which caused brain damage.

Her
body was then dumped in an underpass near her home in Berkshire.

She also suffered a number of 
broken fingers, caused as the victim tried to defend herself from the 
brutal blows which rained down on her head.

Jurors were told how Shafi was accused of killing her by smashing her over the head with the pair of metal tinsnips.

Days before her tragic death, Tuk, as she was known, 
confided in a pal that Shafi had asked her to have a threesome with him 
and that he had become enraged when she refused.

She had told her
friend that one of Shafi’s male friends was staying with the couple and
that Shafi had wanted the man to sleep in their bedroom.

Alan Blake, prosecuting, said: 'Shafi had suggested that he and Tuk should have sex and the friend should join in.

'She refused and the defendant became angry.'

But Shafi’s male friend told 
police that although he had slept in their bedroom, he had not shared 
their bed and there had been no suggestion of a threesome.

Shafi, 28, had married his 
Thai girlfriend in an Islamic marriage in December last year, the jury 
at Reading Crown Court was told.

They had sought to register the 
marriage under UK law in February but it had to be cancelled after the 
victim’s documents relating to the divorce of her German husband were 
not in order.

Shafi was on a student visa from Islamabad in Pakistan and ran a business placing students onto UK training courses.

Mother-of-one Tuanjai Sprengel, 43, died from serious head injuries in a subway in Bracknell, Berkshire

He was granted an extension to stay on the grounds of the couple's serious relationship.

While Ms Sprengel had told friends 
and family that the pair 'loved each other', her cousin Jurairat 
Buncherd became concerned that it was a 'marriage of convenience', 
allowing Shafi to remain in the country.

The jury of eight women and four men were told that Shafi murdered Tuk and tried to cover his tracks.

Mr Blake told the hearing: 'The 
prosecution allege that this defendant - Muhammad Shafi - who is 28 
years old, murdered his partner, Tuanjai Sprengel, aged 43 years, in an 
underpass in Bracknell in the early hours of May 27 this year.

'He stabbed her in the neck with a kitchen knife but it was not that injury that led to her death.

'The fatal injuries were caused when 
the defendant repeatedly bashed her over the back of the head with a 
pair of metal tin snips.

'That caused multiple skull fractures and brain damage.

'Her fingers were bruised and fractured as she protected her head from the blows.

'He left her in that underpass and returned towards their home address.

'He deposed of the knife and the metal
tin snips in shrubbery near their house. He changed out of his 
bloodstained clothing and put it in a rucksack,' added the prosecutor.

'Later that morning he took that 
rucksack to a nearby house where he tried to persuade the people there 
to take possession of it.

'But they refused and he himself then took the bag himself and disposed of it.'

The jury heard how he arrived at his 
friend Idress Haider's home early on Sunday morning and told him 'I've 
done a very bad thing' before later confessing that he had 'hit or 
killed his wife'.

Mr Haider told police that when he asked Shafi 'is she dead?' he replied 'she must be dead by now, when I left she was gasping'.

The jury heard that police traced the victim to her rented property where they found the defendant.

He was later arrested but answered 'no comment' in interview with detectives.

The Thai woman's body was found dumped in the underpass pictured. A passerby earlier heard screams coming from the victim

However, he did make a short statement via his solicitor.

'He accepted there was an argument 
with his partner but he did not know what caused the fatality and he 
said didn’t intend to cause her any harm,' Mr Blake said.

Tuk, a mother-of-one had also told the couple’s landlord that they had argued because she had said he was gay.

She told Frank Napier in the days before her death that Shafi had left the house after a row.

'She reported that Shafi had gone 
out for the day when Tuk had insinuated that he was homosexual. That 
caused a row,' said Mr Blake.

The court heard how, on the 
evening before Tuk’s death, the couple had gone on a seven hour gambling
spree in a local branch of Ladbrokes where they lost around £1,000.

On the same evening, Ms Sprengel
had confided to a woman at the Ladbrokes betting shop in Bracknell that 
Shafi was ‘jealous and controlling’ and stopped her from working.

The jury was shown CCTV footage of
Shafi twice going outside to get cash and were told they had been in 
the bookies from 3pm to 10pm.

'The staff estimated that they lost £1,000 pounds on the roulette machines,' said Mr Blake.

The couple got a lift home with a friend of Tuk’s, but were later seen on CCTV heading towards the underpass where Tuk died.

At around 4.45am the following 
morning, May 27, a passer-by Charlotte Lenthall walked through the 
underpass and noticed a couple, which the prosecution said was Tuk and 
Shafi.

They were sat cross-legged on the floor facing each other.

She heard them talking in a foreign language as she walked through and noticed that the man had a raised voice.

When she walked out of the underpass Miss Lenthall heard a woman scream but dismissed it as a 'lover’s tiff'.

'She heard another scream that made her feel uneasy, a second smaller scream,' said Mr Blake.

'She continued her journey to work.

'It was when she returned home that she saw that London Road had been cordoned off and saw the murder reported on the news.'

CCTV then showed Shafi walking out of the underpass just minutes after Miss Lenthall.

Later that morning a cyclist, 
Peter Paige, came across what he thought was a mannequin or a drunk, 
only to realise he had found a woman’s body.

He raised the alarm with some workmen loading a nearby van and they called police.

Paramedics arrived at the scene 
and tried to perform CPR on Tuk, only to find a wound on the back of her
head which was 'incompatible with life'.

A post mortem examination revealed that she had died as a result of a severe blunt force trauma to the head.

She had been hit at least nine 
times in quick succession, and also had wounds to her face as it hit the
ground from the force of the blows to the back of her head, as well as 
the stab wound in her neck.

Police found identity documents in
the handbag Tuk had been carrying and went to visit her home, where 
they found Shafi who said that Tuk had gone to meet a friend.

'He was told about the body and was arrested on suspicion of murder,' said Mr Blake.

'He made no reply to the caution.'

The defendant, who was wearing a a
grey jumper, blue polo short and beige trousers, denies murdering the 
43-year-old in a pedestrian subway in Bracknell, Berkshire, on May 27.

The court heard that Shafi admitted 
causing the death of his partner but said he did not intend to kill or 
seriously harm her, who he said he loved very much.

He told police he did not know what 
caused the fatality, and that both parties had the opportunity to leave 
at any time during the argument.

But Mr Blake argued that the 28-year-old 
intentionally murdered his girlfriend during an 'unjustifiable assault' 
using weapons from their home stashed in his clothing.

The jury heard that Shafi may have feared the relationship with Tuk was over when he planned her killing.

Mr Blake told the jury: 'For whatever 
reason, this defendant acknowledged or foresaw the end of the 
relationship with Tuk - a development with several consequences he was 
unable to accept.

'This defendant is guilty, not of the 
lesser offence of manslaughter which he readily admits, but the offence 
of murder of which he is charged.'

Shafi of Basemoors, Bracknell, looked relaxed as he listened to proceedings unfold from the dock.

None of Ms Sprengel’s family from Thailand were in court for the hearing.

The trial continues.
