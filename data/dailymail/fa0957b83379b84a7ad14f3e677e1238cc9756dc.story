The teenage boy who was killed after being struck by lightning in New South Wales' Hunter Valley as wild weather lashed the state has been identified as Jayden Morrissey.

The 15-year-old was holidaying with family friends at One Mile Beach when the tragic accident happened on Saturday afternoon.

Friends of the young rugby league referee - who was from the Thornton and Beresfield area near Newcastle - paid tribute to him, saying they were shocked by the loss.

Melanie Hutchinson, whose sons were friends with Jayden, said his death was 'so devastating'.

'Our sons were mates with Jayden through school and sport - rugby league and touch footy,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was such a respectful, happy young boy who always had a smile.'

The 15-year-old was a rugby league referee in Thornton and surrounding areas. 

Referees operations manager for Newcastle Rugby League Gavin West - who had known Jayden for two years and his father for a long period of time before that - said the teenager got into refereeing because he loved his football.

'He was very small in stature, Jayden, At that stage, his friends were stronger than him and that's why he got into refereeing to keep up with his rugby,' Mr West told Daily Mail Australia.

'He comes from a family very strong rugby league background.

'His father was an assistant coach for the West Newcastle Rosellas and he also takes part in Newcastle Knights development programs.'

Mr West said Jayden was respectful to his elders unlike most children his age and enjoyed watersports, such as surfing.

'At his age, he was a kid with the right attitude towards life and kept himself busy,' he said.

'If he wasn't at the footy ground, he would be at the beach.

'He was very likable character.'

Mr West recalled how the 15-year-old had his own distinctive look, in particular his blond locks.

'He was quite a stylish lad with a long blond fringe and long blonde hair,' he said.

'When he was refereeing, he was always playing with his fringe to keep it out of his eyes.' 

Mr West said Jayden's untimely death was a time for the community to remember life was a gift.

'We start to realise how precious life is with someone as young as 15 taken away from us,' he said.

One Mile Beach in Port Stephens, where the 15-year-old boy died after being struck by lightning

Witnesses told NSW police the 15-year-old was leaving the water after surfing with an adult and friends when he was struck by lightning.

He had only walked about 20m from the water onto the sand as a severe storm rolled over the seaside town about 5pm on Saturday, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 

Emergency services arrived at the scene about 5.10pm at Hannah Parade in One Mile near Port Stephens. 

Friends of the Jayden administered CPR on him before the arrival of paramedics who took over and spent an hour trying to revive him.

Investigations have been launched into the teenager's death and a report is being prepared for the coroner. 

Social media has been flooded with tributes to Jayden and condolence messages to his family.

'Such a polite young man. Would never hesitate to say hello as he went past. So sad to see a kid like him leave us so soon. Miss ya little man,' one friend wrote.

While another said they could not believe the news.

'This was such a shock to find out about Jayden's passing. Way too young. We would like to send our deepest sympathies to [his family]. Shine bright in heaven Jayden,' she posted.

One Mile is located in NSW's Hunter Valley region about 5pm as wild weather lashed the state

An hour earlier before this incident, a 50-year-old man was struck by lightning standing outside a house on Rodd Street in Birrong - in Sydney's south-west.

Officers from Bankstown Local Area Command attended the scene and he was taken to Liverpool Hospital in a serious condition 

The storms also came with damaging winds that brought down power lines, trees and ripped off roofs. 

A lightning strike also sparked a house fire in the south-west suburbs.

A woman felt a tingling sensation after her two-level Lansvale home was struck but managed to escape the house before it was ravaged by fire.

The State Emergency Service (SES) logged more than 1,100 jobs by Saturday night, with the Penrith, Blacktown and Liverpool areas the hardest hit.

Wind gusts reached up to 100km/h in Sydney and ripped part of a roof off a medical centre in Kingswood.

More than 25,000 homes in Sydney were also left without power, according to Endeavour Energy.

SES spokeswoman Sue Pritchard said on Saturday night volunteers had gone to more than 200 calls and had another 900 to go.

'People that have been away for the day and come home may find damage so we could see an influx of calls (on Sunday),' she told AAP.

Police are urging anyone with information in relation to these incidents to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page.
