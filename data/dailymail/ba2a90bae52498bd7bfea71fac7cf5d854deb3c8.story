A conman who acted as a pallbearer at the funeral of a 14-year-old boy has been convicted of stealing money from the youngster's memorial fund.

Mark Faulkner took more than £1,200 from a fund dedicated to the life of Lewis Edge who died in a fall from the Runcorn/Widnes Silver Jubilee bridge in Cheshire in July 2012.

The 26-year-old befriended Lewis's grieving family and offered them guidance in how to raise cash - and even set up a bank account and a board of trustees, Warrington Crown Court heard.

A number of small charity events were staged in the family's home town of Widnes, Cheshire, with Faulkner entrusted with banking the proceeds.

Lewis's mother Lisa Millward became suspicious when a bank statement revealed that there were fewer funds in the account than were expected. 

She contacted Faulkner, a former ice cream man, on a number of occasions and asked for the return of the fund's bank book but he gave her a string of excuses to avoid its return.

Concerns were raised with Cheshire Police who attended Faulkner's home in November 2012 and asked to see the bank book. This was subsequently seized and Faulkner was arrested.

Further examination of the bank book showed that two deposits that Faulkner was due to make were never stamped in the book, said Cheshire Police.

CCTV was also seized from the bank and hours of footage were examined which showed that Faulkner did not enter the bank between the dates given.

During his interview Faulkner denied the theft of the money and maintained he had taken the money in good faith and had transported it to the bank and paid it in.

Faulkner, of Warrington, Cheshire was today convicted by a jury of the theft of £655 from the fund between October 18 2012 and November 10 2012, and a separate theft of £590 from the fund between October 21 2012 and November 10 2012.

He showed no emotion as the unanimous guilty verdict was delivered.

Faulkner, who carried the coffin at Lewis’ funeral and was in the Boy’s Brigade with the youngster, was the trustee of the Lewis Edge Brightest Star Memorial Fund along with Lewis’ father Graeme and mother Lisa  as well as her father Brian Millward.

In his closing statement, John Marsh, defending, said: 'Mr Faulkner devoted a great deal of his time and expertise to help raise funds.

'Mr Faulkner put in hours of work raising funds himself and not once did he ask for any repayment for his work.

'He is a man who has found his world crashing down around him.' 

But after the hearing, Lewis's parents said Faulkner had 'twisted the knife' by dragging them through the courts.

Lewis's mother Lisa said she had been unable to work because of severe depression throughout the 18 month ordeal.

She said: 'I feel like he has twisted the knife by dragging us through the courts. We have not been able to grieve for our son.

'Mark was brilliant after Lewis died. He had so many great ideas and said he'd done it before.

'He even came around to speak to us for long periods. He even used to drive the bus to take our 12-year-old son Josh to rugby.

'But he just doesn't seem bothered with what he's done.

'And he has caused my whole life to fall to pieces. My job, my family, my relationship, it's all fallen to pieces thanks to him.'

Lewis's father Graeme Edge added: 'I hope he gets a custodial sentence.

'He's not just stolen from us, he's stolen from the local community who put money they didn't have into that fund.

'I'd like to thank them for their support through this whole thing.' 

Helen Graves, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Faulkner is a callous thief who targeted a family when they were at their lowest ebb.

'He stole money that had been given by people who had been moved by the tragic suicide of 14 year old Lewis Edge.

'It was to be used to help other teenagers avoid such a fate but Faulkner stole it, then proceeded to try and cover his tracks with a series of lies.

'It had become clear that Faulkner hadn't deposited donations at the bank yet he continually denied this, causing hours of wasted police time as detectives studied CCTV from the bank to see if he was telling the truth.'

Faulkner is due to be sentenced on Wednesday.
