Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, the deeply private heiress caught up in the spectacular downfall of former Senator John Edwards' political career, has died at 103.

Her longtime personal attorney Alexander Forger said from his office in New York City that Mellon died of natural causes Monday at her 4,000-acre horse farm in Upperville, Virginia.

Mellon was long a part of the political scene dating back to the Kennedy White House, but was thrust into the public spotlight as a major donor of the now-disgraced Edwards' failed 2008 presidential bid.

She was thrust into it the American consciousness after almost a century avoiding it when Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards was indicted in 2011 for using what prosecutors alleged was campaign money, including $750,000 from Mellon, to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their child during his 2008 campaign.

Edwards staffers took to calling her large gifts 'Bunny Money,' and was intended for the Senator's personal use, her lawyer said during a 2011 inquiry into his possible misappropriation of donations, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The attorney said Mellon was unaware where the money was funneled, she was never charged with any wrongdoing.

She stuck by her man despite the controversy, telling Newsweek in a 2011 interview, calling him a 'great friend' and saying 'he would have been a great president.'

Her name also found its way onto front pages after former investment adviser Kenneth Starr was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding clients.

Both she and her late husband recommended the con artist to friends, and she expressed regret at being part of their losses, friends told Newsweek.

Mellon's wealth first came from Listerine, her grandfather Jordan Lambert invented it. She inherited the fortune long before marrying industrialist-turned-banker Paul Mellon, who inherited his fortune from father Andrew Mellon.

One of the wealthiest couples in America at the time of their 1948 marriage, they delved into a life of philanthropy, supporting the arts and other causes.

Their wealth brought them famous company including Queen Elizabeth II and husband Prince Phillip, as well as several American politicians including soon-to-be President John F Kennedy and wife Jacqueline Kennedy.

Bunny was invited to the White House soon
 after JFK won the 1960 election - the new first lady leaned on her for 
the tips on interior design and entertaining that became a hallmark of 
the Kennedy White House.

Bunny and Jackie were such close friends that Mellon chartered the private jet that flew the two women to Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral after his 1968 assassination.

Mellon was also tipped to redesign Rose Garden into the space it is today after decades of neglect, according to the Journal. Her familiarity also led to her being the floral director for JFK's funeral a few years later.

All of this came at the cost of husband Paul Mellon having what Newsweek, citing a Washington Post report, called 'a wandering eye.'

He carried on multiple affairs during their marriage, to the point she even invited one of his mistresses on a family vacation, according to the Post.

In the end, though, she found herself blind and alone with her Virginia horse farm and a team of servants.

'Itâ€™s hard being 100 and blind, she told Newsweek. 'I donâ€™t mind being 100, I can cope with that, but not seeing is very scary.'
