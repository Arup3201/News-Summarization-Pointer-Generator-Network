Execution: Death row inmate, Perry Austin, 55, (photographed)  asked an appeals court to drop all of his appeals and set an execution date as soon as possible

A Texas prisoner on death row for killing a 9-year-old boy more than 20 years ago is asking an appeals court to drop all of his appeals and execute him as soon as possible.

Inmate Perry Austin, 55, wrote to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September making the request, KHOU reports, but he has yet to receive a yes or no.

In 2001, Austin confessed to the 1992 murder of 9-year-old David Kazmouz. 

Austin was already serving a 50-year sentence for sexual assault of a child and stabbing an inmate when he confessed, according to the Houston Chronicle. 

In 1992, Austin had been out on parole for about a year for a 1978 rape, attempted rape, and aggravated robbery. The victims were his family members. 

Austin was living in Houston and working for a local street gang as a drug courier, the Chronicle reports. 

That is where he met young Kazmouz's brother Karrem Kazmouz, who was 16 at the time.

Austin thought Karrem had stolen from him. 

So, in an act of revenge, Austin abducted 9-year-old David on Aug. 19 and allegedly injected him with Demerol -- a narcotic pain reliever similar to morphine -- and slit the boy's throat from ear to ear, according to the Chronicle. 

Eight month's later, authorities found the boy's remains in a landfill. 

Initially, Austin was a suspect in the boy's disappearance when he was reported missing, but there was not enough evidence to link him to the crime, the Chronicle reports.

Instead, Austin was arrested and sentenced to 30 years in prison when the investigation into Kazmouz's death led authorities to discover that Austin, then 33, was in a romantic relationship with a 14-year-old girl.

When Austin confessed to murdering the boy in 2001, he was placed on death row but received a stay of execution in 2003. 

But now, the 55-year-old, imprisoned for a slew of crimes ranging from robbery to murder, is asking to be executed.

Austin sent the letter to the appeals court in September and received a response Friday, KWTX reports. 

The appeals court is questioning whether Austin is competent to make the decision to volunteer for execution. They said there is evidence that raises questions about Austin's ability to make the request.
