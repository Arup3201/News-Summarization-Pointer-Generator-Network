Chinese officials are planning to lift spirits  this winter - by putting up thousands of metres of plastic sheeting printed with green shrubs.

The waterproof sheeting has been put up to mask hedges that have lost their leaves in the city of Changchun, the capital of north-eastern China's Jilin Province.

It is all part of a bid to beat the winter blues in the city - and if it works, officials say they would even consider installing plastic flowers.

Green-thinking: Plastic sheets printed with green shrubs have been installed across the city of Changchun in China

Chinese officials want to mask hedges that have lost their leaves in winter - and could install plastic flowers if the scheme is a success

It is all part of a plan to beat the winter blues in the city during the winter months in the north-eastern city

A council official told local media: 'Many people feel depressed in the winter, and the site of the denuded trees only contributes to that feeling. 

'We want to try and cheer people up a bit by putting some greenery around to make them feel better.'

He added: 'If the plastic hedges are greeted favourably by locals, then we might consider similar initiatives around the city. 

'We would not rule out plastic flowers as well.' 

The images were greeted both by people who rubbished the idea and those who welcomed the initiative as a way of brightening the area up in winter

Workers this week were busy putting up the plastic sheeting and tying it to wooden stakes along some of the busiest areas such as Nanhu Road that leads into the city
