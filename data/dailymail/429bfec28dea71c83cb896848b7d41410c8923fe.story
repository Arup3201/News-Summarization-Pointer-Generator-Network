Zebedee Helm and Fi Cotter Craig’s new book, The Middle Class ABC, takes a Rosé-tinted look at leafy suburbia and what makes it tick. Here’s a selection of their affectionate observations. . .

A is for  .  .  . Alessi: Their products are found throughout Middle Class homes. A perfect combination of design and fun (or irritating cuteness and uselessness, if you’re in a bad mood), they prove that  a shopper and his money  are soon parted.

B is for  .  .  . Boutique hotels: It is no longer Middle Class to stay in a hotel; we should use only boutique hotels. There is no difference, apart from the price and the  fact that the bath is often  to be found in the middle of the room.

Middle Class kitchen: An Alessi kettle is stylish and (that ever-present Middle Class word-of-approval) 'fun'

C is for  .  .  . Corduroy:
Tweed, linen and corduroy: the Holey (if you wear them too much) 
Trinity of Middle Class fabrics. You can  tell from the clientele’s cord
count if a pub is  safe to enter.

D is for  .  .  . Design: There is a lot of uncomfortable designer furniture available. If your guests complain of bad backs, tell them the name of the designer and they’ll be so impressed they will quite forget their distress.

E is for  .  .  . Ecomentalism: The Middle Class try to do their bit by eating leftovers, watching documentaries about polar bears and driving diesel cars, but if they truly want to save the planet  they know they should stop  having children, strap windmills to their chimneys and use bicycles. But then they wouldn’t feel Middle Class any more.

F is for  .  .  . Fun: The more a Middle Class person assures you something will be Fun, the more you know it probably won’t. ‘Let’s walk the seven peaks! Come on, it’ll be Fun!’ Fun is our rallying cry: ‘Look at my new hat, I thought it was rather Fun!’ ‘Oh yes! What Fun!’ (What you’re both actually saying is that it’s ghastly.)

G is for  .  .  . Game Fair: Once a year all the animals that haven’t been shot are brought together to celebrate the fact. The Game Fair slogan is ‘Four legs good, 4x4s even better.’

Left, right, left: Although all the Middle Classers do it, getting the continental kissing greeting right is tough

H is for  .  .  . Hoodies:
if their hooded garments are either handknitted or made from cashmere, 
hoodies could be Middle Class. And if their flick-knives turn out to be 
Swiss Army penknives, they are definitely Middle Class.

I is for  .  .  . India: Thanks to cricket and the TV adaptation of The Jewel In The Crown, India is held affectionately in Middle Class hearts. Few are brave enough to actually visit it, but we are now paying the ultimate Middle Class compliment: naming our offspring after it.

J is for  .  .  . Jack Russells: The smallest of the Middle Class dogs and by far the most trouble. Most Middle Class owners acquire one only to make their children look better behaved.

Seal of approval: A pair of corduroys

K is for  .  .  .  Knocking
Through: One of the most important signs of being Middle Class, but the
problem nowadays is that  the house you have just bought has already 
been Knocked Through.

L is for  .  .  . Labrador: The winner of the ‘Best in Middle Class’ category at every year’s Crufts.

M is for  .  .  . My: The ultimate accolade the Middle Class can bestow on a tradesman, as in ‘my plumber’ or ‘my electrician’.

N is for  .  .  . Nettle Soup: If your Middle Class credentials are ever questioned, a hearty panful of this soon silences doubters. Making it ticks  so many Middle Class boxes: it is weeding with a purpose, organic, and it involves foraging.

O is for  .  .  . Overdrafts: It’s what sets us apart from Americans, who love to talk about how much money they have. We like to talk about how much money we haven’t.

P is for  .  .  . Parmesan: For years the Middle Class assumed it was some kind of exotic dust, a flamboyant sprinkle of which over a spag bol bestowed the finishing touch. Then someone went to Italy and discovered it was cheese. It was instantly rebranded Parmigiano, quadrupled in price and we had to grate it ourselves.

Q is for  .  .  . Queuing (and Tutting): The Middle Class are good at both, but you can’t have a queue without a tut. You can, however, have a  tut without a queue.

R is for  .  .  . Rosé: The Middle Class love a compromise, and as compromises go, Rosé is a cracker. It would have caught on sooner had it not come in dodgy-shaped bottles.

Jack Russell: A small and rarely well behaved Middle Class accessory

S is for  .  .  . ‘Sorry’:
Elton John seems to think ‘Sorry’ is the hardest word. He’s clearly 
never played doubles or bumped trollies in Waitrose.

T is for  .  .  . Tree Houses: These used to be knocked up in an afternoon by Dad with some old planks and about four cans of beer. These days they involve architects and need planning permission.

U is for  .  .  . Underfloor Heating: It’s been around since 500 BC, but the Middle Class prefer to think it was invented about ten years ago.

V is for  .  .  . Vacherin: The world’s whiffiest cheese comes in a round wooden box and is the ultimate Middle Class house present. Do not confuse it with La Vache Qui Rit, which is also a cheese that comes in a round box.

Wisteria: A must-have in the Middle Class garden

W is for  .  .  . Wisteria: Having this on the front of your house is the best way of informing passing burglars that it is a Middle Class  home and is probably  stuffed with silver.

X is for  .  .  . XXX (kisses): The Middle Class now greet one another with kisses. The Continentals make it look easy, but we never know which cheek to go for. Some use this as an excuse to go straight for the lips.

Y is for  .  .  . ‘You must  know . . .’: When Middle Class folk meet someone there is a moment of unease until we have discovered who we know in common.

Z is for  .  .  . Zoopla: The Middle Class pore over this property website. The price of other people’s homes is always overestimated while ours is massively underestimated.
