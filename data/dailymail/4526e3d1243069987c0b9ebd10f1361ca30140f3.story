A vast city built by the ancient Mayan civilisation and discovered nearly a century ago in modern day Guatemala is finally starting to yield its secrets - including a hint that apocalyptic predictions around the 'end' of the Mayan Calendar may be wrong.

Excavating for the first time in the 
sprawling complex of Xultzn in Guatemala's Peten region, archaeologists 
have uncovered a structure that contains what appears to be a work space
 for the town's scribe.

Its walls are adorned with unique paintings - one depicting a line-up of men in black uniforms, and  hundreds of scrawled numbers - many calculations relating to the Mayan calendar, and stretching up to 7,000 years into the future.

Four long numbers on the north wall of the ruined house relate to the Maya calendar and computations about the moon, sun and possibly Venus and Mars; the dates may stretch some 7,000 years into the future. These are the first calculations Maya archaeologists have found that seem to tabulate all of these cycles in this way

The Mayan sites in Guatemala have been investigated by scientists since the Seventies

The excavations, which were funded by National Geographic, have already revealed details about the Mayan calendar and the lives of the inhabitants which were previously unknown.

One wall of the structure, thought to be a house, is covered with tiny, millimetre-thick, red and black glyphs unlike any seen before at other Mayan sites. 

Some appear to represent the various calendrical cycles charted by the Mayans - the 260-day ceremonial calendar, the 365-day solar calendar, the 584-day cycle of the planet Venus and the 780-day cycle of Mars.

Four long numbers on the north wall of the ruined house relate to the Maya calendar and computations about the moon, sun and possibly Venus and Mars; the dates may stretch some 7,000 years into the future.

‘Why would they go into those numbers if the world is going
to come to an end this year?’ observed Anthony Aveni of Colgate University in
Hamilton, N.Y., an expert on Mayan astronomy. ‘You could say a number that big
at least suggests that time marches on.’

These are the first calculations Maya archaeologists have found that seem to tabulate all of these cycles in this way.

Although they all involve common multiples of key calendrical and astronomical cycles, the exact significance of these particular spans of time is not known.

Archaeologist William Saturno, of Boston University in the United States who led the exploration and excavation, said: ‘For the first time we get to see what may be actual records kept by a scribe, whose job was to be official record keeper. 

‘It's like an episode of TV's 'Big Bang Theory,' a geek math problem and they're painting it on the wall. They seem to be using it like a blackboard.’The scientists say that despite popular belief, there is no sign that the Mayan calendar - or the world - was to end in the year 2012, just one of its calendar cycles.

Anthony Aveni, professor of astronomy and anthropology at Colgate University, said: ‘It's like the odometer of a car, with the Maya calendar rolling over from the 120,000s to 130,000.‘The car gets a step closer to the junkyard as the numbers turn over; the Maya just start over.’

Archaeologist William Saturno of Boston University carefully uncovers art and writings left by the Maya some 1,200 years ago

 Incriptions on Mayan tablets found in temples such as Tortuguero refer to 'the end' - and many internet conspiracy theories have predicted our world will be swallowed by a black hole, hit by an asteroid or devoured by ancient gods.

But many ethnic Mayans dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea.

Rather than the end of time itself, the inscriptions refer to the start of a new era.

The 'apocalypse' refers to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C.

The paintings represent the first Maya art to be found on the walls of a house.

The walls reveal the oldest known astronomical tables from
the Maya.

Scientists already knew they must have been keeping such records at
that time, but until now the oldest known examples dated from about 600 years
later.

Astronomical records were key to the Mayan calendar, which
has gotten some attention recently because of doomsday warnings that it
predicts the end of the world this December.

Experts say it makes no such
prediction. The new finding provides a bit of backup: The calculations include
a time span longer than 6,000 years that could extend well beyond 2012.

Aveni, along with William Saturno of Boston University and
others, report the discovery in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

The room, a bit bigger than 6-feet square, is part of a
large complex of Mayan ruins in the rain forest at Xultun in northeastern
Guatemala. The walls also contain portraits of a seated king and some other
figures, but it's clear those have no connection to the astronomical writings,
the scientists said.

One wall contains a calendar based on phases of the moon,
covering about 13 years. The researchers said they think it might have been
used to keep track of which deity was overseeing the moon at particular times.

Aveni said it would allow scribes to predict the appearance
of a full moon years in advance, for example. Such record-keeping was key to
Mayan astrology and rituals, and maybe would be used to advise the king on when
to go to war or how good this year's crops would be, he said.

‘`What you have here is astronomy driven by religion,’ he
said.

On an adjacent wall are numbers indicating four time spans
from roughly 935 to 6,700 years. It's not clear what they represent, but maybe
the scribes were doing calculations that combined observations from important
astronomical events like the movements of Mars, Venus and the moon, the
researchers said.

Why bother to do that? Maybe the scribes were ‘geeks ... who
just got carried away with doing these kinds of computations and calculations,
and probably did them far beyond the needs of ordinary society,’ Aveni
suggested.

Experts unconnected with the discovery said it was a significant
advance.

‘It's really a wonderful surprise,’ said Simon Martin,
co-curator of an exhibit about the Mayan calendar at the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

While the results of the scribes' work were known from carvings
on monuments, ‘we've never really been able to identify a working space, or how
they actually went about things,’ Martin said.

The new work gives insight into that, he said, and the fact
the room had a stone roof rather than thatching supports previous indications
that the scribes enjoyed a high social standing.

‘It's a very important discovery. We're only getting a
glimpse of it’ in the published paper, said John B. Carlson, director of the
Center for Archaeoastronomy in College Park, Md.

‘This is an intriguing start for this discovery.’

Xultzn, a 12 square mile site where tens of thousands once lived, was first discovered about 100 years ago by Guatemalan workers and roughly mapped in the 1920s by Sylvanus Morley, who named the site ‘Xultzn’ - ‘end stone.’

Scientists from Harvard University mapped more of the site in the 1970s.

The house discovered by Prof Saturno's team was numbered 54 of 56 structures counted and mapped at that time. Thousands at Xultzn remain uncounted.

The team's excavations reveal that monumental construction at Xultzn began in the first centuries B.C. 

The site thrived until the end of the Classic Maya period; the site's last carved monument dates to around 890 A.D.

Prof Saturno saidd: ‘It's weird that the Xultzn finds exist at all. Such writings and artwork on walls don't preserve well in the Maya lowlands, especially in a house buried only a meter below the surface.’

Prof Aveni added: ‘The most exciting point is that we now see that the Maya were making such computations hundreds of years - and in places other than books - before they recorded them in the Codices.’

The findings were reported in National Geographic magazine and in the journal Science.
