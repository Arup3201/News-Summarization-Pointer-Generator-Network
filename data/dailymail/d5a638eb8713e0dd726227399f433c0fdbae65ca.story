Sarah Ezekiel is paralysed due to motor neurone disease. She has rebuilt her life thanks to a computer that works by tracking her eye movements

A mother paralysed from the neck down has rebuilt her life thanks to a computer that works by tracking her eye movements. 

Sarah Ezekiel, who has motor neurone disease, uses the technology to talk, email, book appointments and contact friends and family.

But she has also managed to continue her hobby of painting – and has become such a success that she now has her own exhibition.

The computer, called a Tobii Eyegaze, works by tracking eye movements via an infrared bar, giving users full mouse control with their eyes.

Users simply look at the computer screen and control the mouse cursor with their eye movements. They can then select by blinking or staring for a prolonged period.

The technology has helped thousands of people, some suffering from a spinal cord injury, become more independent. 

Ms Ezekiel, 46, said: ‘Everything was pretty straightforward for me until the age of 34.

'I was happily married with a beautiful little girl and pregnant with my much longed for second child. I was healthy, fit and enjoying my pregnancy. I couldn't have asked for more.

‘Then in February 2000, I noticed some weakness in my left arm and my speech was slurring. Two months later I had a definite diagnosis of motor neurone disease. It happened that quickly and I was absolutely terrified.

‘My world was shattered. My marriage collapsed as I became progressively disabled. I couldn't physically care for my children or myself anymore, and spiralled into deep depression. 

‘I'm now a single, disabled parent who is totally dependent on carers for everything. I never expected my life to change so tragically and it took me years to see anything positive about my situation.

‘But, I pulled myself up from rock bottom and if I could do it then I believe that anyone can. The first step was to start attending my local Marie Curie hospice in April 2001. I receive amazing care and really love going there.’

Ms Ezekiel who lives in North London, previously 
worked as a legal secretary. She currently has full custody of her two 
children, 15-year-old Aviva and Eric, 12.

She creates the pictures from scratch, often taking inspiration from other images she has discovered online, or pictures she has been sent.

The device can be attached to a normal desktop computer and costs £3,200 each.

Ms Ezekiel is now also selling her paintings in order to raise money for people like herself who need this technology to get by day-to-day.

She has set up a not-for-profit organisation so that any money she makes from painting with her eyes can buy another person with motor neurone disease a Tobii Eyegaze computer. For every one that she donates, the company will match it.

She said: ‘I've had articles published, given presentations to health professionals, made two films, participated in several photo shoots and had my portrait painted. 

‘Approximately 5,000 people have this 
devastating illness in the UK and 5 people die from it every day. My aim
is to continue to raise awareness of MND until a cure is found.’

There is currently no government funding for technology such as this in the UK, even though the internet is becoming more and more essential for disabled people to use on their day-to-day lives.

It’s estimated there are 3.9 million disabled adults in the UK defined by the Disability Discrimination Act  who have never used the internet and next year the welfare system will undergo an overhaul as universal credit is introduced. This benefit will replace six others and it includes a new requirement to apply for benefits online.

The technology Ms Ezekiel uses is only a year old and currently, only around 100 people in the UK have the device at home. However, a number of special needs schools and hospices do have the device for people to use communally.
