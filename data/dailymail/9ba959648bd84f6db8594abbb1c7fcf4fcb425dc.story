They are some of fashion’s best known names.

But the appearance of Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell provoked an instant Twitter backlash last night.

There was also ridicule on Twitter at the inclusion of supermodel Moss – who has been involved in controversies involving her alleged cocaine abuse - and was branded an ‘overpaid drug abusing model’.

Controversial: The appearance of Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell provoked an instant Twitter backlash last night

History: Both supermodels have been involved in controversies over the years

Star-studded: Kate Moss (4th left, front), Naomi Campbell (4th right), Lily Cole (L), Alessandra Ambrosio (centre-rear), Jourdan Dunn (3rd right) Karen Elson (2nd left, rear), Georgia May Jagger (2nd right), David Gandy (right) and Stella Tennant (2nd left front)

And the simultaneous entry of always 
controversial Campbell - known for hurling mobile phones - prompted 
raised eyebrows, too in a ceremony supposedly celebrating the Olympic 
ideal.

Piers Morgan wrote on twitter: ‘I suspect Kate Moss might fail her drugs test later.’

Jojo
Mayes wrote: ‘Naomi Campbell: gold medal in phone throwing’, while 
Charles Arthur wrote: ‘Kate Moss! Who represents the Olympic ideals of 
not doing drugs, or smoking, and achieving lots. Work with me here.

Glittering gold: The models all strutted around on the stage, reminiscent of a catwalk

Centre stage: Some Twitter users said that the inclusion of the supermodels was the 'antidote' to recent positive Olympic coverage of women

One
Twitter user, Rob Hearn, added:  ‘What’s great about the Olympics is 
that it’s about people of substance rather than vacuous celebri- oh, 
never mind’

Alex 
Rushmer said:  ‘After two weeks of seeing the most positive role models 
slogging their guts out, this vacuous celebrity b******* is just the 
antidote’ while Lauren Rutherford said: ‘The vacuous and self-obsessed 
fashion industry there, in stark contrast to the hundreds of amazing 
people surrounding them.

Others were surprised to see former spice girl Victoria Beckham taking her place on the list of showcased designers with Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.

Mrs Beckham – who only launched her 
fashion range in 2007 - was included on a supposedly selective list of 
the finest fashion designers the country has ever produced.

Only
nine of the very best – namely Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, 
Christopher Kane, Burberry, Erdem, Jonathan Saunders, Stephen Jones and 
Paul Smith -were featured.

With her fashions only a few years old – and receiving lukewarm reviews among some critics – observers will question whether her presence on the list is little more than a giant advert.

There was a supermodel for each great British fashion designer featured in the fashion segment, with Georgia May Jagger modelling Beckham’s wares.

Eleven cutters and designers are reported to help Mrs Beckham to design the clothes lines that bear her name.

And the results have received mixed reviews in the fashion world.

There have been accusations that the designs are seriously overpriced, with dresses in her mainline brand costing around £1,650 each, and a pair of leather leggings bearing her name once priced at £1250.

One of her lines- entitled, ‘Victoria, Victoria Beckham’ – was recently marketed as being affordable and good value for money.

But the marketing caused ridicule when it emerged that a sleeveless wool shift dress cost £500 while a long-sleeved day dress cost £750.

She has also been criticized for marketing herself as a ‘British’ designer while having her clothes made overseas in Morocco and Portugal, instead of in Britain.
