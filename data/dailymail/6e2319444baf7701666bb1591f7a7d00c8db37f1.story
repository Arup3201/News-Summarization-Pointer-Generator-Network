A six-year-old boy is critically ill in hospital after being found trapped underwater by his inflatable rubber ring.

The boy was rescued by a member of the public after he slipped through the middle of the ring he was wearing around his waist while playing in the sea at Portland, Dorset, on Wednesday.

It is not known exactly how long he was trapped under the water before the swimmer spotted him and came to his aid.

Rescue: The six-year-old boy was airlifted to hospital by the Portland coastguard helicopter after being found trapped under the water in the sea off Chesil Cove

The six-year-old was not breathing when he was carried back to the beach at Chesil Cove, and another bystander began performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the child before ambulance paramedics arrived and took over.

They managed to resuscitate the child, who has not been named, and he was flown to Dorset County Hospital at around 7pm on Wednesday.

Andy Jenkins, the duty watch manager at Portland coastguard, said the boy remained in a 'very poor state' in hospital.

'As far as we know the child possibly slipped through a rubber ring and somehow had gone underneath it and remained stuck under the water,' Mr Jenkins said.

'We don’t know how long it was before people noticed what had happened.

'The initial report we received from the ambulance service was that a child had been pulled out of the water and wasn’t breathing.

'The last we heard from the hospital was he is in a very poor state.

'This was such an awful and unusual thing to have happened.

'If they (inflatables) are used then people need to keep an eye on them and, in the case of rubber dinghies, attach a line to them.'

The shingle beach at Chesil Cove was evacuated last night to allow the Portland coastguard helicopter to land.

A woman who lives nearby, who asked not to be named, said: 'My house is opposite the beach and I saw loads of police cars, the coastguards and the helicopter so I went out to have a look.

'I heard a boy had got into difficulty in the water.

'The helicopter landed on the beach and picked up the boy but I wasn’t close enough to see what state he was in or if his parents were there,' the woman added.

A spokesman for Dorset police said: 'Our officers were called to a report of a child struggling in the water.

'The child, a six-year-old boy from Hampshire, was recovered from the water and treated at the scene by members of the public.

'He was taken to hospital where he remains in a serious condition. There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding this incident.'

A spokesman for the South Western Ambulance Service said: 'We got a call at 6.58pm to Chesil beach to a six-year-old boy who was on the beach with breathing difficulties.

'We treated him on the beach and he was taken to the Dorset County Hospital by coastguard helicopter.'

The boy was later transferred to the Southampton General Hospital which has a specialist neurological unit.
