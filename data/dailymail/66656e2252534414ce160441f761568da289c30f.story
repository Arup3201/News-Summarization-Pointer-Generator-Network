A soldier who had post-traumatic stress disorder after seeing five colleagues shot in Afghanistan was jailed for six years yesterday for killing his infant daughter.

Liam Culverhouse, 25, left seven-week-old Khloe with severe brain damage and multiple fractures to her skull, ribs and limbs.

Just over a week before the attack, Culverhouse told neighbours and other family members how he could not cope with a crying child.

Khloe died 17 months later after contracting pneumonia, having remained in hospital and hospice care for the rest of her short life.

The former Grenadier Guardsman had cheated death when he was shot six times – losing his right eye – after a rogue Afghan policeman sprayed his base in Helmand Province with bullets in November 2009.

The following August he was referred for anger management after confiding in a military GP how he would fly off the handle since the ordeal – and no longer trusted himself to handle crying children on his own.

But by the first anniversary of the Helmand massacre, Culverhouse had stopped attending the therapy sessions and was discharged soon after.

He went on to attack Khloe, his daughter with ‘on-off’ partner Claire Abrams, 25, at their Northampton home in May 2011 – nine days before telling an inquest into the Helmand massacre how he had ‘played dead’ to avoid being shot.

He admitted causing or allowing the 
death of his daughter at an earlier hearing and was jailed yesterday at 
Northampton Crown Court.

Sentencing him, Mr Justice Baker said it was clear the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder had contributed to the tragedy.

'I hope that the prison sentence affords him the chance to reflect on his actions and be truly remorseful for failing to adequately care for his child'

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, Northamptonshire Police

He told Culverhouse: ‘No one who has understood what happened to you in November 2009 whilst serving as a member of the British Army in Afghanistan can have anything but profound sympathy for the effect which it had upon you.

'Not only will you have to live with the physical symptoms including blindness in your right eye, but it is clear that the trauma of that and of witnessing the death of a number of your fellow soldiers has caused you to suffer from significant psychological damage’.

But the judge said that while Culverhouse, who was medically discharged from the Army last April, had acknowledged  that he had problems controlling his temper, by ceasing his therapy he had ‘failed to alleviate that risk’.

He was initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The baby had been attacked on at least four occasions, the court heard.

Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, said Culverhouse was a ‘very troubled man … and clearly unfit to look after a small baby’.

In March 2010, Culverhouse appeared in a Channel 4 documentary in which he told how he played dead during the attack in Afghanistan when the gunman shot him six times in his face and both arms and legs as he tried to escape.

He described the moment he heard the footsteps of the gunman pacing over to him to make sure he was dead. The shootings sent shockwaves through the Nato mission in Afghanistan.

Danger: In the documentary, Culverhouse said he and his colleagues picked up a 'funny atmosphere' at the checkpoint before the shooting

Those killed in the shooting were 
Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant, 40, Sergeant Matthew Telford, 37, 
and Guardsman Jimmy Major, 18, of the Grenadier Guards, and Corporal 
Steven Boote, 22, and Corporal Nicholas Webster-Smith, 24, of the Royal 
Military Police.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killings but British military sources suggested it was more likely that the incident was a one-off and unconnected to insurgents. The rogue gunman has never been caught.

In the documentary, Culverhouse said he and his colleagues picked up a 'funny atmosphere' at the checkpoint before the shooting but could not have predicted what happened.

The soldier revealed that the troops were having a competition to see who could catch the most mice when the policeman opened fire.

He said: 'I remember getting hit in the face with something and I remember shouting and swearing.

'I remember saying, "f****** hell, what was that?" and I covered my face and turned around to see the back of an Afghan, one of the police officers, shooting the lads.'
