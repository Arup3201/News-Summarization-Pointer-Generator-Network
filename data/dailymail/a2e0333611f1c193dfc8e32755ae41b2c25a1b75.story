The Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit says they have found a mysterious teenage boy who appears in an online video thanks to the public's help.

Federal agents told the MailOnline that they were also able to rescue a child victim.

Last week, ICE released two stills from the video and say the boy - between 13 and 19 - is in a 'dangerous environment' with several other children and at least one adult.

Today, charges of sexual assault of a child and the sexual exploitation of a child were filed against a juvenile suspect, though agents remain tight-lipped on the exact circumstances of the boy in photographs - refusing to say whether he is the victim or has victimized someone else.

Mystery: In the photos, the teen appears to be in a basement and is aged between 13 and 19. He is wearing a Minnesota Twins baseball T-shirt

Information leading to identifying the teen was provided by an anonymous tipster that called investigators.

Special agents in St. Paul, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C. — in cooperation with investigators from the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation — worked together to bring the teen into custody on June 25.

They said they also were able to identify and rescue a child victim.

'Due to the ages of the individuals involved and the sensitive nature of this on-going investigation, no further information can be released at this time,' ICE said in a statement.

The Wisconsin District Attorney's office
said today that a 7-count charge was filed today in Winnebago County 
Circuit Court in the juvenile division in connection with this case.

'The success of this investigation is another example of the important role all citizens play in protecting our children,' said Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.

The first four counts are first-degree sexual assault of a child, the fifth count is the sexual exploitation of a child and the remaining two involve exposing genitals to a child.

The assistant district attorney said that they will be pursuing a waiver to try the suspect in adult court.

In the pictures released last week, the teen appears to be in a basement and aged between 13 and 19. He is wearing a Minnesota Twins baseball T-shirt. This was one of the few leads the agency had.

ICE believes that the recording was made within the last 18 months or two years, based on the design of the boy's T-shirt.

The logo was first marketed by the baseball team in July 2010 but appears to be faded.

In danger: It is thought that an adult might be involved and officials expect state-level charges to be filed in connection with the case

'We have reason to believe that this 
person may now live, or may have lived at one time, in either Minnesota 
or western Wisconsin,' ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer told CNN.

'It is entirely possible this young man is not currently in Minnesota or Wisconsin, but has either a friend or relative in the area, or recently moved from one of those states,' he said.

In the photos, it looks like he may be talking to another person - possibly an older person - off camera.

'We believe there's an adult involved in all of this,' said Mr Neudauer. 

It is thought that the teen is particularly at risk because he is unable to ask for help from the police. 

'If we can identify the young person involved, we suspect that we'll be able to remove a couple of young people from a dangerous environment and also, perhaps, identify an adult.'

It is not usual for ICE to issue a public appeal, but their hope that the public would be able to identify the boy and help him was rewarded.

'Issuing a public plea is an extraordinary step by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, warranted by our belief that there may be young people at risk without the ability to ask for law enforcement's help,' he said.
