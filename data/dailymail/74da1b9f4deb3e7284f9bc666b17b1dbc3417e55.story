The biological father, stepmother and paternal grandparents of an American Indian girl at the center of an ongoing custody battle have filed papers to adopt the child in an Oklahoma court.

Dusten Brown signed away all custodial rights when his daughter Veronica was born in September 2009. She lived with her adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco from then until 2011, when Brown used his Native American roots to secure custody of the three-year-old.

On Monday, he filed court papers to formally adopt the child, a move that could likely complicate the custody dispute.

Attorneys for Mr and Mrs Capobianco and for Veronica's biological mother, Christinna Maldonado, said the action defies high court justices who asked South Carolina judges to determine where the girl should live.

The lawyer for Maldonado, Lori Alvino McGill, said her client hasn't agreed to anyone adopting Veronica other than the Capobianos, whom she chose through an adoption agency.

She said she would fight the termination of her parental rights if the planned adoption doesn't go through.

'We believe these frivolous filings in other jurisdictions are designed to further delay the proceedings in the hope that it will make it harder for South Carolina to finalize the (Capobiancos') adoption,' McGill told The Post and Courier.

Dusten Brown's Charleston attorney Shannon Jones said her client simply wanted to continue raising his daughter.

'We are just trying to follow the direction and guidance of the majority opinion and let the court decide what is in the child's best interest at this point,' Jones told The Post and Courier.

Baby Veronica had been adopted at birth by the South Carolina couple, with Matt even cutting the umbilical cord.

But Brown, a member of the 
Cherokee Nation, claimed the baby's mother 
had given the child up without his consent.

When
Brown challenged the Capobiancos' adoption, his lawyers cited  the Indian Child Welfare Act, a federal law that gives tribes and 
relatives a say in decisions affecting children with Native American 
heritage.

It was passed in 1978 because of the high 
number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public and 
private agencies.

A South Carolina court 
favored his argument that federal law preferred the girl living with him 
and growing up learning tribal traditions and the child was handed over to him after a court battle in December 2011.

The Supreme Court ruled late last month that the law didn't apply to the dispute the way the South Carolina judge thought it did.

The justices said Brown's parental rights could have been terminated because he never had custody of the girl and never supported her.

The case was thrown back to the South Carolina Supreme court with the order it be expedited so Veronica's situation could be determined.

Veronica 'has been extremely well cared for and loved by her father and has thrived,' the adoption papers state, according to the Post and Courier.

Since then the Capobiancos have been fighting to regain custody of their adopted 
daughter Veronica and in April they took their fight to the highest court in the land.

The Capobiancos appealed to the state Supreme Court last July, claiming they had bonded with Veronica and arguing that removing Veronica was detrimental to her development.

But
justices sided with Brown, saying in an emotional opinion that, while 
the Capobiancos were 'ideal parents,' federal law requires that 
custodial preference be given to the child's Native American parent.

Meanwhile, Brown claims his daughter no longer even 
recognizes the family who raised her for the first two years of her 
life. She was handed over to him on New Year's Eve 2011 and he says the bonding process was instantaneous.

Brown claims Veronica had started to call him 'Daddy' within minutes of them meeting and a week after moving to his home in Nowata, Oklahoma, she had also started to call his wife Robin Brown 'Mommy'.

Sixteen months later, Brown says that he and his wife are 'the only family she has ever known.'

'I know that I'm doing just fine raising my daughter and supporting my wife,' he told Tulsa World. 'I'm always going to be her Daddy, no matter what.'

Brown also revealed that the Capobiancos have sent gifts to Veronica with their photos hidden inside.

'When she finds them,' he said, 'she'll always ask us, "Who are these people?" She doesn't remember.'

In
January, the Capobiancos claimed that they have had just one phone call 
with Veronica since she left in December 2011 and that they told her 
they love her.

'We remain hopeful that our daughter 
will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be 
surrounded by everyone who loves her,' they said in a statement.

More than a dozen states and 23 current and former members of Congress filed briefs ahead of the earlier supreme court case Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl hearing.

In addition, the federal government filed an amicus brief backing the law, as did more than a dozen child welfare organizations.

State courts have been at odds on the law's application. The group has filed a brief supporting the Capobiancos' case.

It says the court previously has ruled 
on the rights of mothers and unwed fathers - rights that, a past 
president of the group said, federal law hasn't defined, at least for 
Native American children.

'Those cases clearly state that unwed fathers do not have an automatic fully protected right to participate in decisions about the child,' Seattle adoption attorney Mark Demaray said earlier this years during a conference call with reporters.

Case law aside, Demaray said, the emotional aspects of the case are hard to ignore.

'We often refer to cases like this one before the Supreme Court as a tragic situation we all want to avoid,' Demaray said. 'There's no question this case is tragic for all the families and parties involved in it, particularly for this child, no matter what the outcome.'
