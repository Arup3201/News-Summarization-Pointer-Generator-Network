One was once the king of football, the other of wrestling, but now, David Beckham and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson have plenty of time to 'hang' now they're retired.

The pair, who share the same birthday on May 2, got together and posed for a photo, which The Rock took to Instagram to show off.

'Hang time with the boys. Good to see my bud - one of the best dudes I know #Beckham,' he added.

Pose: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and David Beckham took the photograph together

The duo looked as fit as ever, and neither tend to shy away from showing off their physiques.

Beckham was pictured modelling in his AW14 Bodywear collection for high street 
store H&M at the beginning of July.

Yet again, the 39-year-old showed off his chiseled abs and array of body art to make women swoon and plenty of men jealous.
