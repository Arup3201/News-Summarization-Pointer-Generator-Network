When Gower College lecturer Calvin Williams fell from a cliff 50 feet (15 metres) high in 2004, he feared his love of mountain biking might be over.

With extensive leg injuries that would confine him to a wheelchair for a year, he realised there were other similar people in his position who were unable to ride a standard two-wheeled mountain bike.

So he decided to design and build a bike with four wheels that could be ridden by disabled people, and the fruits of his labour are now starting to materialise.

Gower College engineering lecturer Calvin Williams (pictured) has designed and built a four-wheeled mountain bike known as Project Enduro. He decided to start the project, giving disabled people the chance to mountain bike, after falling from a cliff and suffering leg injuries in 2004

His endeavour is called Project Enduro, an initiative supported by the Welsh Government through European Regional Development Funding.

Called the Juggernaut, this $2500 (£1,500) bike can ride with ease across snow and ice, and also across curbs and steps.

The father and son inventors claim its two front wheels give the bike far more stability.

The idea 
came from experiencing the challenges of carrying a surfboard on a bike 
with a surf rack to a local surf break and having to dismount to push 
the bike up stairs and through deep sand, the firm said.

The company experimented with several designs, and now Rungu Trikes roll through deep sand and up short flights of stairs. 

Enduro has the goal of designing and manufacturing a prototype four-wheeled mountain bike.

This is predominantly for use by disabled people – although it seems others aren’t disqualified from enjoying the bike either.

The bike, a collaboration with Swansea Metropolitan University, is ‘powered’ by gravity alone.

It has no pedals, with the ‘rider’ instead sitting in a seat between all four wheels.

A set of handlebars then allows them to steer as they make their way down a course.

The bike is built with carbon-fibre seating and top-end suspension.

Its aim is to encourage extreme sports enthusiasts to grasp the concept of ‘gravity biking’ – cycling at top speeds downhill.

The
 first prototype was unveiled back in February, and the team have now 
been testing a second prototype in Snowdonia, north Wales.

The second builds upon the design, comfort and safety issues identified in the first.

And Project Enduro is beginning to make an impact on the extreme sports market.

Mountain bikers make their way down Snowdon led by Phill Hall with the four-wheeler mountain bike in north Wales. The prototype four wheeler bicycle is believed to be only the second-ever manufactured in the world

It’s believed that innovations such as these will continue to lead the way for the future development of both bike manufacturing and healthcare products for disabled people.

And the goal is now to officially launch the product, which is built entirely in Wales, onto the market by December 2014.

‘The project is developing well beyond our initial aspirations,’ said Williams.

‘As time goes on more trails are becoming available to ride the bikes and we are having enquiries from potential riders from across the world.

‘Hopefully we will see a race series soon, where able bodied and disabled athletes will be competing head to head at Welsh trail centres.’
