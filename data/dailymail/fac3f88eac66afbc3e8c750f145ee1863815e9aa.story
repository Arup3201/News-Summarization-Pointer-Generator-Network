If you started the new year with all good intentions to lose weight, but are already flagging, let your smartphone shame you into shedding the pounds.

Carrot Hunger is the latest in a line of 'sadistic' apps designed to motivate people to get fit and lose weight by being judged and 'shouted at'. 

The Hunger app lets users count their daily calorie intake, tells them how much exercise they'd need to do to burn it off, and can even tell people to step away from their fridge or cookie jar.

Carrot Hunger is the follow-up to Carrot Fit, and both were created by Pennsylvania developer Brian Mueller. 

His range of apps is designed to 'threaten, intimidate and ridicule' users into losing weight. 

Users add food to their diary either by searching the database, or scanning the bar code.

Scientists in Southampton recently developed a 'smart bra' that can measure the wearer’s mood.

The bra is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity.

Researchers claim that by monitoring emotions, the bra can help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss.

Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse.

For each food item entered, the app converts the calories into easy-to-understand terms. 

For example, the calories in a slice of pizza translate into a 90-minute walk. 

The app also tells someone how many miles they would need to run to burn off certain foods. 

If a user eats too many calories, or starts putting on weight, their avatar 'blimps' up, and the user is 'punished' into getting back on track. 

For example, Carrot will show fullscreen adverts, or send tweets about their weight gain.

And, when used with an iBeacon inside the fridge, for example, Carrot knows when their reaching for food.

It then reminds users to log any food they've taken out of the fridge, or will sound a loud alarm if they're nearing their calorie limit.

With Carrot Fit, released last year, Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the 'Carrot overlord' (pictured). Equally, if they lose weight, Carrot  offers encouragement

Carrot Fit was released last year.

Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the ‘Carrot overlord’, yet equally, if they lose weight, Carrot offers encouragement.

As well as encouragement, people who lose weight will be given rewards such as workout tips and advice.

According to the app's description: 'Carrot is a sadistic AI construct with one simple goal: to transform your flabby carcass into a Grade A specimen of the human race.

'She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen. You will lose weight - or else.'

As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit monitors their BMI and updates them on their progress.

All weight loss is tracked on a graph that can be shared with friends and at each weigh-in, Carrot will let the user know how much they've lost and the difference compared to the previous weigh-in.

Users can set goal weights, share their progress with friends and set reminder to weigh themselves.

Mr Mueller said he didn’t create Carrot Fit to make people feel bad, instead he wanted to make 'weight loss entertaining and funny.'

The Hunger app is free, but the Fit app costs £2.49 in the UK and $2.99 on the US store. 

Mueller has previously created similar apps, called Carrot To-Do and Carrot Alarm, that both use an avatar to encourage users to be more productive, or active.

A recent survey, commissioned for the start of National Obesity Awareness Week, has found that almost a third (28 per cent) of UK adults live a 'lethargic lifestyle.'

A fifth said they rarely exercise, while eight per cent admitted they never exercise at all.

Of those who don't exercise, 40 per cent said it was because 'they couldn’t be bothered'. 

Women were the idlest sex, with 44 per cent saying they were too lazy to exercise, compared with 29 per cent of men. 

While almost two thirds of 18 to 24-year-olds blamed laziness for their lack of motivation, making them the most lackadaisical age group.

Among the adults surveyed, 16 per cent said they didn’t exercise as the people at gym intimidated them. 

Women were more likely than men to attribute their lack of motivation to this, with 20 per cent of females naming it as the core obstacle to fitness compared with 13 per cent of men.

The study was commissioned by international group fitness brand Les Mills.
