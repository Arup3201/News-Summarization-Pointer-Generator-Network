A new injection has been invented, which its makers claim dissolves fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate.

The new treatment, dubbed Aqualyx, claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction - and Sharon Donaldson, 39, from Liverpool, was one of the first women to try it.

Sharon paid £1000 to have fat zapping treatment on her face and midriff, before getting married to Peter, 32, last year.

During the treatment, a water solution was injected into 
stubborn areas - in Sharon's case her tummy and chin.

The
 jab then it works by breaking down the fat. The injection contains plant polymers, which 
bind with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and 
releasing the fat to be dissolved.

The formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three-week period.

Sharon, a
 receptionist, paid £900 for a series of three injections, each a month 
apart, at the Dr James Kimilu clinic in Liverpool City Centre.

She
 had already lost two stone, taking her from 10st 2lbs to 8st 5lbs, and 
dropped from a size 14 to a size 10 before her wedding to hubby Peter 
but wanted to look her best in her dress.

She said: 'I know people might think it was a quick fix but I really wanted to look good and I'd tried dieting and exercising and it wasn't giving me the results I needed.

Sharon also had injections under her jaw to get rid of her double chin

'Liposuction seemed too drastic and while the injections are a form of surgery, it seems much less invasive. After each session I was a bit sore and bruised but that soon passed and I haven't any scars. I've finally got the body I've always wanted.'

During the procedure, the fatty area, which in Sharon's case was the lower abdomen and chin, is marked with a pen and a canula - a needle with a tube in - is placed under the skin and the Aqualyx solution is injected.

It takes around ten minutes for each area and the patient is left with swelling and soreness for a few days, but should see results after a week or so.

Dr Kimilu, who carried out the treatment
 on Sharon, explained: 'Aqualyx is a fat removal therapy used as an 
alternative to liposuction. It is not intended for weight loss, but to 
improve the contour of the body.

'It is used to reduce stubborn fat 
deposits in areas such as the chin, stomach, saddle bags, outer and 
inner thighs, back fat and thoracic folds and injected directly into the
 subcutaneous fat tissue using very thin, sharp cannulas.

'The
 treated fat cells are gradually dissolved and the metabolism in the 
area is increased. It’s ideal for those patients with stubborn fat that 
will not respond to diet and exercise.'

Sharon said: 'Having a slim, toned 
stomach has given me so much more confidence and I had spent years 
working in the gym and trying every diet you can think of to achieve 
what I have now.'

But experts have warned that, if the jab works as its makers claim, then users risk increased cholesterol and blood sugar levels and run the risk of becoming diabetic.

Dr
 Arun Ghosh from Spire Hospital Liverpool said: 'I’ve seen a lot of 
treatments that claim to reduce fat by breaking it down into an acid so 
the body reabsorbs it then passes it out and it just doesn’t happen.

 on Sharon, explained: 'Aqualyx is a fat removal therapy used as an 
alternative to liposuction. It is not intended for weight loss, but to 
improve the contour of the body

'It’s so dangerous to reabsorb fatty acids into your blood stream as if it’s dissolved down into salt it would send your cholesterol levels sky high.

'If it’s broken down into sugars then you are sending your glucose levels sky high that can lead to diabetes.

“I can’t see any independent evidence that backs up the claims of Aqualyx which makes me very skeptical of this.

'The only real way to get rid of stubborn areas of fat is to dissolve it and suck it out with liposuction.'

Julia Buckley, nutrition and fitness expert and author of The Fat Burn Revolution, said she would urge people to use diet and exercise instead.

She said: 'I'm very skeptical about the claims the manufacturer is making. But even if it does destroy fat cells, if people do not change their lifestyles, I expect that the body would produce new fat cells to replace them.'

Aqualyx, like lipo, is not recommended for weight loss goals but rather to contour the body

'Also, if it only destroys fat cells 
in particular areas then excess calories will continue to be stored in 
fat cells elsewhere on the body and I'd be worried about the health 
implications of this - as well as whether people could end up with 
strange-looking body shapes.

'It's
 always going to be so much better to shed fat and get into shape 
naturally with a good nutrition and exercise programme. That way you'll 
get healthier, fitter and stronger, as well as leaner.'

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 
Harley Street, said: 'I don’t use fat removal injectables in my clinic 
and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and 
trials published.

'It’s 
always important that prospective patients thoroughly research 
treatments before they book, and these injectables are very new to the 
market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced 
by the manufacturer.

'While
 the cost is certainly affordable and attractive, those thinking of 
having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have 
proven results and existing patient testimonials.

'Also, prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern.'
