NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer had an extraordinary rant blasting race organizers for trying to put on a 'cute show' after he spectacularly crashed out of Daytona 500 qualifying.

The 35-year-old spun off the track after he made contact with the back of Reed Sorenson's Number 44 Chevrolet, accusing him of making a desperate move in the build up. 

Parts of debris started flying off both cars before they came to a stop. A furious Bowyer then got out of his car and approached Sorenson's driver's side window to yell at him.

Dramatic: Clint Bowyer spun of the track after he made contact with the back of Reed Sorenson's Number 44 Chevrolet during qualifying for the Daytona 500 on Sunday 

Furious: Parts of debris started flying off both cars before they came to a stop. A furious Bowyer then got out of his car and approached Sorenson's driver's side window to start an argument

After he was checked over by medical officials, he was interviewed by Fox Sports and slammed the new qualifying process that had been initiated. 

Drivers initially competed for positions through single-car runs. But they introduced group qualifying last season and decided to use it for the Daytona 500.  

Visibly angry by what had happened, Bowyer said: 'It's just idiotic to be out here doing this anyway. 

'There is no sense in being able to try and put on some cute show for whatever the hell this is, then you've got a guy out there in desperation doing crap like this. 

'There's no reason to be out here. These guys have been working for six months, busting their ass on these cars, to go out there have some guy out of desperation pull this crap.

Angry: After stepping out of his wrecked car and getting checked over by medical staff, Bowyer said in an interview with Fox Sports: 'It's just idiotic to be out here doing this'

Cause: He shifted the blame to NASCAR during the interview, blasting the new qualifying format that had been put in place 

'It ain't his fault. It's not. It's NASCAR's fault for putting us out here in the middle of this crap for nothing. We used to come down here and worry about who was going to sit on the front row and pole for the biggest race of the year. 

'Now all we do is worry about how a start-and-park like this out of desperation is going to knock us out of the Daytona 500. We've been in meetings for 45 minutes just to figure out what the hell everybody's going to do just to make the race. It's stupid. There's no sense in doing this.' 

In 2012, Bowyer was accused of deliberately crashing his car and starting a huge brawl in the pits. It was the result of a long-time feud with fellow driver Jeff Gordon.
