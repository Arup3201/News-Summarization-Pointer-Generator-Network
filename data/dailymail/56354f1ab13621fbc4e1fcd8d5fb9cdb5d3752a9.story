Sami Hyypia revealed he considered extending his Liverpool career by two years because of his record of scoring in Champions League quarter-finals.

The Finn spent 10 years at Anfield where he made 464 appearances between 1999 and 2009 and scored 35 goals.

But Hyypia, who now manages Brighton, says his knack of scoring in Europe’s elite club competition almost convinced him to stay at Liverpool until 2011.

Hyypia told LFCTV HD: ‘I scored in 2002 against Leverkusen, 2005 against Juventus and 2008 against Arsenal.

‘There were three years between each one. It's funny because I thought: 'Shall I continue playing until 2011 as I might hit the net again in the quarter-final of the Champions League that year.'

As it happens, Liverpool failed to qualify for the Champions League at the end of the 2010-11 season and ended up playing in the Europa League.

Hyypia scored in Liverpool’s run to winning the competition in 2005 with a thumping left foot volley against Juventus and looks back fondly on his time at the club.

He added: ‘Sometimes when you think back to those days and what has happened, those kinds of stats come up. At the time you don't think about it but when you look back at your career those things pop up and they are good memories.’
