Jim Caldwell, the genial quinquagenarian who quotes George S Patton in press conferences, has a calm demeanour which is rubbing off on the Detroit Lions.

Previously an ill-disciplined bunch seemingly capable of spectacular implosions, the Lions lead the NFC North and ooze confidence on and off the field.

Turnovers and penalties are down, and while they previously relied upon their offense to win games, it is when they do not have the ball that they are the most dangerous.

Teryl Austin has a fully functioning defense at his disposal. It features a fearsome front four, a linebacker capable of dominating the run in DeAndre Levy, while Glover Quin, Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay have made a mockery of pre-season fears about the secondary.

Jim Caldwell's reign has started in favourable fashion with the perennial underachievers looking to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2011

In the past, the Lions have struggled to overcome injuries. And there have been some bizarre ones this season. 

Linebacker Stephen Tulloch is out for the season after tearing his ACL celebrating a sack on Aaron Rodgers. He played the previous 131 games. Meanwhile, tight end Joseph Fauria is still sidelined after injuring his ankle while trying to stop his dog urinating in his house.

And that's without mention of Calvin Johnson. The Lions have recorded back-to-back wins as the All-Pro receiver struggles with an ankle injury.

But Caldwell's next man up policy seems to be creating a different breed of Lions.

Sunday saw a remarkable 13-point comeback in the final four minutes to win against the Saints. The gutsy win was exactly the sort of perfomance which would have eluded combustible former coach Jim Schwartz.

And while Schwartz, now Buffalo's defensive co-ordinator, temporarily got one over his old team with his bizarre post-game celebration  in week five, the Lions are a Wembley win away from going 6-2 into the bye.

The team have sung Caldwell's praises all season. From president Tom Lewand to media personnel, no-one has a bad word to say about him. They say his calm nature and logical methods have spread through the organisation.

'He’s exactly what I hoped and expected he would be during the interview process, if not better,' Lewand said ahead of the Lions' first practice session on English soil.

Asked to summarise success this season, defensive end Jason Jones added: 'Maybe it was just the change with the coaching staff. Coach Caldwell has brought in a different message over to us. He treats us like men and professionals. That’s how we’ll carry our business.'

Caldwell  commands and emits respect. When he talks, people listen. And when he divulged the secrets to his leadership, the answer was typically straightforward.

'I simply treat them as men, hold them accountable for what they do and try to take care of them.

'I know at one point in time I was reading an old military magazine or one of the military manuals that Patton had put together and in it, one of the things he said was: "Take care of your men". And that stuck out to me.

Golden Tate, a free agency acquisition, has shown the Lions that they can cope without Calvin Johnson

'Even as a young coach, I was probably in my twenties at that time and I wrote it down and I felt that was something that was extremely important because I could sense it and see why it was important in the profession in the profession of which I was in.

'And I’ve always felt that to be the case, that you have to try to  give them the best opportunity to be the absolute best they can.

So, it’s our duty to have empathy along with expertise and I think that’s really what coaching is all about. And I think that’s probably what they’re responding to, but it’s really more about them than me.' 

A typically modest response from the man who may just be turning the tide in Detroit.
