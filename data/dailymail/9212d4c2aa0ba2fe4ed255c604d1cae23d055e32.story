Rising numbers of Britons are suffering burns from hot water bottles, warn experts.

Researchers say they have become increasingly popular in the home as a cheap alternative to turning on the heating.

But if the bottles are poorly made or the rubber has perished, they can explode without warning during the night.

This can cause serious burns or scalds which in some cases are so serious that patients require skin grafts.

Researchers say the number of hot water bottles being used in Britain has risen due to the rising cost of the heating

Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years.

But they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital.

One reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes.

Furthermore the researchers say rising numbers of families are using them as a 'cost-effective' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on their energy bills.

Quentin Frew, of Anglia Ruskin University, said: 'Anecdotally we have seen an increase in burns caused by hot water bottles in the last couple of years.

'It could be that more people are using them as a cost-effective way of keeping warm or it could be that people are buying cheaper hot water bottles over the internet from abroad.Â 

'What we have seen at the hospital is only the tip of the iceberg, as the majority of these cases go unreported. People try and manage the burns themselves, often because they are embarrassed about what they have done or the area they have burnt.

'When looking at burns from hot water bottles it is sometimes difficult to say which have been caused by patient misuse and which are due to poor manufacturing standards.

'What is clear is that there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long-term burn injuries and also highlight the precautionary measures that could be taken to prevent such injuries.

'One common problem is people storing them incorrectly, which can cause the rubber to perish.'

The researchers looked at the medical notes of 50 patients who had suffered burns and scalds from hot water bottles.

They found that injuries took an average of 25 days to heal - three and a half weeks. And in three of the patients, including two children, the burns were so serious they needed skin grafts.

In some cases patients were to blame for the injuries as they had filled bottles with boiling water that causes the rubber to wear out.

The NHS does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns.

But last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids, which would include hot water bottles.
