Snow is clobbering New England for the third Monday in a row - threatening to cover Boston with up to two feet by the end of the day and leaving city officials at a loss over where to put it all.

Nearly five feet of snow has been dumped on Boston in just over two weeks and plows have removed enough to fill 90 football stadiums, according to Governor Charlie Baker. The city has already drained its $18 million snow removal budget and it's now struggling to keep up with the newest batch.

'Quite honestly we're running out of space where to put all the snow that we have in the city of Boston,' Mayor Marty Walsh said on Sunday.

The four-day storm that has sat over the region is set to intensify today - making for a hellish morning commute, canceling school across Boston through Tuesday and scuppering hundreds of flights.

The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for central New York, the western Catskills and much of New England as the region gears up for yet another wintry week.

Some areas of Massachusetts had about a foot of snow before dawn on Monday, and the storm was expected to last all day Monday. 

The weather service reported an unofficial measurement of almost 14 inches in Norwell as of 5 a.m. Monday. Fitchburg, Leominster, Lunenburg and Ashby in north-central Massachusetts were all at 11 inches or more.

Boston, already reeling from record snowfalls, could get two feet more, while more than eight could also fall on Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and parts of upstate New York.

Logan airport in Boston canceled 60 per cent of all flights Monday. Just before noon on Monday, more than 1,800 fights had been canceled across the country - with those heading to Logan most affected. A total of 280 flights leaving Logan on Monday were canceled, while 334 incoming flights were also scrapped - with many more delayed, according to FlightStats.

It received almost eight inches of fresh snow Sunday and nearly four inches of snow fell on the airport between midnight and 7am on Monday - totaling more than a foot since Saturday.

In New York, accumulations of six to eight inches were predicted in northern New York, five to 10 inches in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes, and four to eight inches in western New York. Buffalo was expected to get two to six inches.

'I'm frustrated. The last thing I want to be talking about is another 24 inches of snow. I want to move on to something else,' Mayor Walsh said at City Hall on Sunday.

'It's unprecedented. ... Maybe up in Alaska or Buffalo, they have this amount of snow and they're used to it.'

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker ordered non-emergency state employees to stay home and most public schools are closed.  

The Weather Channel predicted that a light accumulation of snow could amass over Monday night.

Driving delays were predicted from New England to the east of Pennsylvania, with I-95, I-84, I-90, I-91 and I-81 highways are those expected to be hit hardest. The Massachusetts Turnpike was reduced to 40 mph along the entire length of the highway, and in New Hampshire, speeds were reduced to 45 mph on the highways.

Some 36 million people in the region are under a government winter weather advisory, with a more significant winter storm warning for the majority of New Englanders. 

The storm is expected to sit over Massachusetts for most of tomorrow, then move north into Maine and leave the region by Tuesday evening. 

Schools will be closed across Boston on Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of the coming downfall, and a parking ban is currently in effect. 

In addition, court closings Monday meant another weather-related delay in jury selection in the Boston Marathon bombing trial and in the murder trial in Fall River of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez.

No stopping her: Snow falls as a cross-country skier makes her way through the fresh powder in Concord, New Hampshire

Michelle Currie, a mother of five whose kids have already missed several days of school, posted on her Facebook page a photo of a weather map showing up to 18 inches of snow could fall on her home in Dracut, less than an hour's drive north of Boston.

'I have to laugh because otherwise I may cry,' she said. 

In New Hampshire, the steady run of winter blasts has already sucked up over 70 percent of the Department of Transportation winter maintenance budget.

The small college town of Henniker, which lost its fleet of plows in a fire Jan. 30, was using plows on loan from the state. DOT spokesman Bill Boynton said the three back-up trucks would probably remain with the town throughout the winter.

While the snow is welcome at New England ski resorts, it's a headache for some businesses.

'I normally have 15 to 20 dogs for day care but that's down to half a dozen; people can't get here,' said Bruce Billings, owner of Canine College and Bow Wow Resort, a dog training, day care and boarding center in Holbrook, Massachusetts, 10 miles south of Boston.

Billings said he's trying to clear outdoor play areas with a snow blower because only the biggest dogs can frolic through snow that's 2 to 3 feet deep.

Boston's transit system, the nation's oldest, has been particularly hard hit. 

The buildup of snow and ice on trolley tracks combined with aging equipment has stalled trains in recent days, delaying and angering commuters. 

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority general manager Beverly Scott said Saturday that crews were doing everything they could, including deploying massive jet-powered snow blowers, to clear tracks before the next storm.

Governor Charlie Baker acknowledged on Friday that the MBTA was handed an extraordinary situation with old equipment but said the system's overall performance was unacceptable.

What forecasters are calling a 'long duration' storm is expected to become more intense on Sunday

In many New England communities, the obvious problem is where to put the next batch of snow.

In Revere, just outside Boston, schoolteacher Ingrid Samuel said there were 'mountains of snow' and the streets 'can't take another hit of snow on top of what's here.'

'There's a bunch of snow everywhere, and there's no more place to put it,' said Samuel, who lost a week of work after the last snowstorm canceled classes. 

'There are no sidewalks left in Revere. My whole yard is covered with snow. Where will it end?'

David Lombari, public works director for West Warwick, Rhode Island, told the Providence Journal his town was already clogged with snow piles several feet high and school buses were parked in the usual snow storage lot.

'I don't know what we're going to do yet,' Lombari said. 'It's tough trying to find a place that meets all the proper (environmental) criteria.'

State snow disposal guidelines require that communities use locations that won't harm environmental resources and have barriers that prevent contaminants from seeping into groundwater when the snow melts.
