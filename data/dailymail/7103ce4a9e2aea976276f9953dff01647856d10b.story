Beach-goers in a Jersey Shore town were left shocked after spotting a couple in the ocean allegedly having sex.

Witnesses said the pair waded out into the water until it was about thigh height before engaging in the act in full view of the beach.

The couple - a 27-year-old male and a 23-year-old female, both from Philadelphia - were charged with lewdness.

Charged: A Twitter user with the handle @BerenstainGer captured this picture of the couple accused of a sex act in the ocean

The incident, which took place in front 
of families with children, reportedly happened at about 4pm on Sunday on
 a beach in Sea Isle City, New Jersey.

Witnesses immediately took to Twitter to talk about it.

One user, called Colin J, said: 'Wow there's a couple having sex in the ocean on 43rd st. Good Lord.'

Police were called to the scene and attempted to wave the couple in from the water, CBS Philly reported.

It apparently took the woman a long time to exit the water because she had difficulty tying up her bikini bottom.

Once the couple exited the water, a witness said the couple were placed in handcuffs and taken off the beach.

The names of the two suspects were not released.

The Sea Isle City Police Department were not available for comment.
