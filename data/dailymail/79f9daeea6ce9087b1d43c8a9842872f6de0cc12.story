Protest: Maria Alyokhina, pictured last year, has gone on a hunger strike after a court blocked her from attending her parole hearing

A jailed member of the Russian punk group Pussy Riot was taken to hospital yesterday on the seventh day of her hunger strike.

Maria Alekhina, 24, is protesting against what she claims is a campaign of persecution against her.

She was transferred to a hospital in her prison colony in the Ural Mountains town of Berezniki, according to Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of one of her band mates, who visited the prison yesterday.

Alekhina went on a hunger strike after she was barred from attending her own parole hearing.

The court, which is across the street from the colony, denied her release.

Three members of the band - Alekhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich - were convicted last year of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' for an impromptu punk protest against Vladimir Putin in Moscow's main cathedral and given two-year sentences.

Samutsevich was later released on appeal. Last month a court in the Mordovia province denied parole to Tolokonnikova, 23, who is married to Verzilov.

In a letter dated Monday and published by her lawyers, Alekhina said prison officials were attempting to turn fellow inmates against her by holding a security crackdown in advance of the parole hearing.

Inmates could previously enter and leave their workplace freely, but now they have to wait for up to an hour for prison guards to escort them, Alekhina's lawyer Irina Khrunova said.

The wait denies them prompt medical care when they sustain injuries during their work sewing uniforms, she added.

Samutsevich said the prison administration directly linked the crackdown to Alekhina's 'fight against the prison colony and her open statements against the violations of inmates' rights'.

She said the prison administration, 
as an arm of the government, had taken a negative attitude toward the 
Pussy Riot members from the beginning.

'This negative attitude has been 
building up all the time and now it has turned into an open conflict 
between the prison colony administration and Masha (Alekhina), and 
surely this has very unpleasant consequences,' Samutsevich said 
yesterday.

Alekhina earlier spent five months in
solitary confinement after claiming that officials deliberately lodged 
her with hardened criminals, including a convicted murderer, and 
encouraged them to intimidate her.

In a complaint filed in January, 
Khrunova wrote that officials did nothing after seeing criminals 
threaten Alekhina with violence.

The lawyer said officials also wrote false psychiatric reports and pushed Alekhina into violating colony rules.

Judges have recently lifted several reprimands that officials filed against Alekhina.

Following Ms Alyokhina’s decision to 
go on hunger strike, Sir Paul McCartney wrote to Russian authorities 
asking them to consider her parole.

The
former Beatle, who has previously expressed his support for the group, 
has asked officials to grant Ms Alyokhina the right to be present at a 
future hearing in several handwritten letters.

He
said: ‘My personal belief is that further incarceration for Maria will 
be harmful for her and the situation as a whole, which, of course, is 
being watched by people all over the world.

‘In the great tradition of fair-mindedness which the Russian people (many of whom are my friends) are famous for, I believe that you granting this request would send a very positive message to all the people who have followed this case.’

In a further letter, regarding Ms Tolokonnikova, Sir Paul said: ‘I have had a long relationship with the Russian people, and, with this in mind, I am making the following request in a spirit of friendship for my many Russian acquaintances who, like me, believe in treating people - all people - with compassion and kindness.’

Ms Alyokhina's mother, Natalia, said 
she had little faith in Russian justice and would not raise her hopes of
her daughter's parole.

'I don't expect anything good from the judge. It will be hard,' she said.

According to documents read in court 
Ms Alyokhina's behaviour in prison may risk her parole.

She is said to 
be rude to prison staff and to not respect sleeping hours.

The three Pussy Riot members were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' last August, following a trial seen by their supporters as part of a clampdown on dissent by Putin during his third term in power.
