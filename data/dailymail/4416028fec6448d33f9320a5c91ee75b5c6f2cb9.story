Craig Burley was forced to get a tattoo of Fernando Torres after insisting the Atletico Madrid striker had no chance of finding the net against rivals Real in the Copa del Rey last week.

Following Torres' nightmare spell at Chelsea, former Blues midfielder Burley was so confident the Spaniard's barren run would continue with his new club that he promised to get the striker inked on his arm should he hit the target.

Unfortunately for Burley, 'El Nino' took just a minute to prove him wrong - sweeping Antoine Griezmann's cross into the top corner to give Atletico the lead.

A man of his word, Burley was soon off to the nearest tattoo parlour to undergo his forfeit after losing the bet.

'I need a soccer player tattooed,' said Burley to the American tattooist behind the counter at the shop in Bristol, Connecticut. 'He's a Spanish guy and he's let me down badly in a bet. Fernando Torres?'

Asked if he is a fan of the striker, 43-year-old Burley gave a firm: 'No.'

'I think I've made a humongous mistake,' a fearful Burley admitted as he sat down in the tattooist's chair before the former Scotland international insisted he won't be making any more 'bold, stupid' predictions in the future.

After some more grimacing, the tattoo was complete leaving Burley with a permanent Torres reminder inked on his arm.

However, some skeptics may have their doubts as to whether the imprint on Burley's arm is  the real deal - you can judge for yourselves by watching the video below.

Torres, meanwhile, scored a brace for Atletico  at the Bernabeu as Diego Simeone's men claimed a 4-2 aggregate victory in the Copa del Rey clash.

The current La Liga champions face Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the competition on Wednesday night. 

Torres struggled for form during his three years at Stamford Bridge - perhaps the main reason for Burley doubting his capabilities in front of goal - finding the target just 45 times in 172 appearances for Chelsea.
