Tragedy: Izzy Dix, 14, was found hanged by her mother, who today released a poem written by her daughter before she died

The words are harrowing and haunting. For the mother of the tormented teenager who wrote them, they must have been unbearable to read.

The poem printed here was written by 14-year-old Izzy Dix, who killed herself in September after suffering months of cruel taunts from fellow school pupils and internet trolls.

Yesterday her grieving mother Gabbi released the work to the public in the hope that her daughter’s words might make other potential bullies think twice about their behaviour and perhaps prevent further tragedy.

Mrs Dix, who lives in Brixham, Devon, said her daughter wrote the piece after attending a local music festival in July and returning home in floods of tears.

Called I Give Up, it reads: ‘They begin to tell me that nobody wants me there. They tell me to leave and that I am not wanted.

‘I look down and walk, my eyes drowning in a sea of emotion. Another piece of me chiselled away by their cruel remarks and perceptions. I give up.’

The poem was read out at the schoolgirl’s funeral where it reduced many mourners to tears.

Mrs Dix said she decided to publish it to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying and abuse on social media sites.

She said: ‘I know this may be uncomfortable for people but this is what was going on in my daughter’s life before she died. In her own words, this is how she was feeling.’

She added: ‘I want young people all around the world to think about the potential impact of their behaviour before they act.

‘We all need to be motivated by love and kindness, not nastiness and hate.’

Mrs Dix has also called for the closure of the controversial website Ask.fm, where Izzy was abused by anonymous cyber bullies.

The Latvian-based site, which has been linked to several teenage suicides, allows unidentified users to post comments and questions to a person’s profile.

Izzy’s father Eugene Conway has helped launch an online petition addressed to David Cameron, who has previously described Ask.fm as ‘vile’. It calls on the Government to ban the site, and so far has attracted more than 8,000 signatures.

The petition states: ‘On the night of Tuesday 17th September 2013, 14-year-old Devon schoolgirl Izzy Dix tragically took her own life. Her death has been linked to bullying, both at school and online.

‘A lot of the bullying Izzy was troubled over occurred on social media site Ask.fm. We want it closed down.

‘It gives cyber bullies a platform, 
allowing them to post hurtful comments and remain anonymous.’ Mr Conway 
said: ‘I know she is at least the tenth teenager to have taken her life 
because of it.

‘It is time we ramped up the pressure on the people who run this site to get it taken down.’

Izzy’s
friend Tia Budd said: ‘It’s horrible and should be closed.’ She added: 
‘We have deleted our accounts, but there are still people taking the 
hate and it doesn’t need to happen.’

Police have said they are not treating the death as suspicious. An inquest is due to be held at a later date.
