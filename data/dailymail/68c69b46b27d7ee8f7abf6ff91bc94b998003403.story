An excitable Ollie Locke shared the 
secrets of his intimate grooming regime with a morning TV show - and the rest
 of the country - today.

'I DO get my bum waxed. I 
DO,' the tanned 27-year-old exclaimed at the beginning of a 10-minute 
hair removal 'tried and tested' section during This Morning.

An excitable Ollie, 27, shared the 
secrets of his intimate grooming regime with This Morning - and the rest
 of the country - today, before waxing a volunteer

'A friend comes round to do it for me,' he confided to a surprised Holly and Phillip.

'It's a bit too awkward to go to a salon, because you're there getting your bum waxed and someone will say "So what's going on in the series?"'.

After the waxing, comes 'sugaring' where a sticky, sweet substance is smeared on, then ripped off with a strip to remove hair

'Manscaping is important whether 
you're a guy or a girl,' continued the immaculately-groomed Big Brother runner-up
 and Made In Chelsea star.

However, in spite of his fondness for manscaping, Ollie did not try out the various recommended hair removal methods, instead testing them out on volunteers.

Ollie put a variety of hair removal 
methods through their paces, ranging from the £449 Homedica Me Pro Ultra
 at-home laser treatment to live - and extremely painful-looking chest 
waxing and failed 'sugaring'.

Homedica Me Pro Ultra, £449

An at-home device which will remove hair permanently, with minimal pain and fuss.

No No! Hair, £193.50

You can use it on the bikini line, sensitive areas such as the face. There is a slight burning smell, however that just shows it is working on removing the hair

Braun Silk Epil, £89.99

Removes
 hair but also apparently has massaging, tightening effect. Uses 40 
tweezers to pluck out hairs from root. Not a permanent method of removal, although hair does grow back more sparsely after repeated use.

Parissa wax strips, £10.99

Removes hair efficiently but painfully, as shown on our clip.

Anubis sugaring starter kit, £25.95

Works in a similar way to waxing, but all-natural and made only of sugar. However, the sticky substance got stuck on the tester's chest hair, so didn't actually get rid of any fur.

Nad's For Men hair removal cream, £8.99

Gets rid of hair without pain, but re-growth very quick as not plucked from follicle.

Could a new career in the beauty and grooming industry be on the cards? 

Ollie recently came third in Big Brother behind former N-Dubz singer Dappy and winner Jim Davidson, so his popularity with the public is in no doubt.

Fans were hoping that he and TOWIE star Sam Faiers would start an on-set romance, but it was not to be.

Sam first claimed to fancy Ollie during a task set by Big Brother earlier in the series but the pair's friendship seemed to grow stronger as time moved on.

And, in the penultimate episode of the season on Tuesday night, Ollie attempted to tell Sam he was attracted to her but felt he couldn't express his true feelings in front of the cameras.

However, things fizzled once the pair were out of the house and there are rumours that Sam and her ex Joey Essex are once more an item.
