Chris Christie’s recent weight loss was on display for all to see when he played in a celebrity softball game at Yankee Stadium on Monday.

The New Jersey Gov. remains a relatively roly poly figure, but has undoubtedly lost a substantial amount of weight since secretly undergoing Lap-Band surgery in February of last year.

The governor's Team Boomer, headed by WFAN radio co-hosts ‘Boomer’ Esiason and Craig Carton, eked out a 7-6 win against players from the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team and New York Yankees alumni at the fourth annual Bombers Boomer Broadway Softball Classic.

In the running: Chris Christie's recent weight loss was on display for all to see when he played in a celebrity softball game at Yankee Stadium on Monday

Christie, who was a star catcher in high school and continues to be a baseball fan, appeared enthusiastic throughout the game, particularly when playing third base in the mostly empty ballpark.

After several fumbles early on, Christie wound up making a crucial catch to end the 7th inning, helping his team to victory.

‘We had the game on the line. Ground ball to third, man on first and second. He bobbled it a little bit but made the play and got the out,’ said Carton, a longtime friend of the governor, who assured reporters Christie had ‘held his own.’

As he warmed up before the game, Christie, who was inducted last year into the Little League Hall of Excellence, said he was happy to have a break from Trenton and that he hoped he wouldn't get injured on the field.

Afterward, he seemed pleased with his performance.

‘We won, so it went just fine,’ said Christie, who wore No. 55 because he is the state's 55th governor.

Esiason gave Christie an A-plus for efforts, but he joked the governor's execution ‘probably should be a little bit better. But at the end of the day, he's here for the right reason, and that's all I care about,’ he said.

He also heaped praise on the governor for participating in the game, which he estimated had raised between $30,000 and $40,000 for cystic fibrosis research.

‘Not many politicians would go out there on third base and put himself in the line of fire like that,’ Esiason said.

Christie, 51, acknowledged that he has lost weight at a town hall event late last month.

He told a constituent he was 'much smaller now than he used to be', but didn't give a clear indication of how much weight he had lost.

Politico speculated that the presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate could have lost as much as 85 pounds and that his weight had dropped to roughly 236 pounds.

Christie had the Lap-Band surgery in February 2013, and managed to keep it out of the press for nearly two months.

He said he had the surgery to restrict his food intake because he wanted to get healthy for his family's sake.

'It has nothing to do the performance of my job,' he told People magazine afterward. He denied that his potential presidential plans had something to do with the decision.

'My decisions about anything to do with my career are based upon what I think is best for me and best for my family,' he said when his surgery finally became public.

'Whatever size I happen to be when I have to make a decision about what to do next in my career, I doubt that'll play any role or effect in what I decide to do.'

Regardless of the motivation for his surgery, Christie's frame has noticeably shrunk throughout the last year and a half - something a constituent pointed out last month at one of the Governor's town halls.

'By the way, you do look fantastic,' a female constituent told him.

'God bless you,' Christie told her.

The Republican Governor noted that he's lost so much weight, his wife thinks he should buy new suits.

'But I’m on a budget. I gotta be careful, you know?' Christie told the woman.
