Families in an area of Leeds are most at risk of being burgled, according to a league table that identifies Britain’s most dangerous places to live.

Research analysing insurance claims identifies LS13, where terraced houses sell for just over £100,000, as the UK’s worst burglary hot spot.

The figures mean residents not only face the misery of being burgled but could also pay 20 per cent more for home insurance.

Crime: Bradford postcode BD12, around five miles away from Leeds, took second place in the table

Insurance companies use data on the number of burglaries per household to decide which areas should face the highest annual premiums.

LS13 is to the west of Leeds and incorporates Bramley – a mix of 1960s council estates and private suburbs – Gamble Hill, Moorside, Rodley and Swinnow.

Bradford postcode BD12, around five miles away, took second place.

North Finchley – N12 – in London came third, ahead of Eccles in Manchester – M30 – and the Romford postcode of RM3.

The figures were compiled by the price comparison website MoneySupermarket.com, which warned families living in high risk postcodes will generally pay 20per cent more for household insurance.

Its home insurance expert, Hannah Jones,
said: ‘While there are clearly some areas of the country with a higher 
proportion of insurance claims for burglary than others, this doesn’t 
actually mean the area is ‘rife’ with crime.

‘Thieves often 
specifically target areas with wealthy residents, or quieter areas where
there’s not a lot of passing foot traffic, where the rewards are 
potentially greater and the risk of being caught in the act may be 
lower.

‘This year, the LS13 postcode in Leeds has taken the top spot for burglary insurance claims.’

She
added: ‘Areas affected by higher rates of burglary insurance claims 
will see their premiums impacted – increasing by a fifth on average.

‘Higher value properties could expect to pay even more than this.’

She
warned: ‘Insurers take a blanket approach to assessing postcode 
districts for home insurance premiums rather than looking at insurance 
applications on a case by case basis.

‘So, although you may not 
have been a victim of burglary directly, you could be paying more for 
insurance if there are higher rates of burglary claims made within your 
postal area.’
