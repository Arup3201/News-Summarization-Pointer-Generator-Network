Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher believes Danny Welbeck's international career has been more impressive than that of Daniel Sturridge.

The former Chelsea and Manchester City forward has been sorely missed by Liverpool this season, with Brendan Rodgers' side languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, but Carragher believes England are more reliant on Arsenal man Welbeck

Carragher told talkSPORT: 'Well I think certainly Welbeck now, he think he may have just edged ahead of Sturridge in terms of what he has done for England, you think of that game in Switzerland.' 

Jamie Carragher claimed Danny Welbeck has done more while playing for England than Daniel Sturridge

Sturridge has scored five goals in 16 appearances for England while Welbeck has 11 goals in 30 appearances

Sturridge, who has been out with a thigh injury, rejoined training on Thursday but Carragher warned Liverpool fans not to expect too much too soon from the 25-year-old.

'You can't just expect Daniel Sturridge to come out firing on all cylinders,' he said. 

'I don't want to put too much pressure on him but it looks like it is down to him because there's not too much else there at the moment. 

'Hopefully when this international break is out of the way we can start to see the real Liverpool.'

England face Slovenia on Saturday in their Euro 2016 qualifying clash, where Welbeck will hope to partner former club-mate Wayne Rooney up front. The England captain will be making his 100th international appearance.  

Sturridge has been sorely missed by Liverpool, who are currently in the bottom half of the Premier League

Welbeck moved to Arsenal from boyhood club Manchester United for £16million in the summer
