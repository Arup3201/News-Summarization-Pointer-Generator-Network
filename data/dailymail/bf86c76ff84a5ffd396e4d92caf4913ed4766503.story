New Orleans musician Doug Potter is fighting for his life in hospital after being brutally assaulted in a street attack

A popular New Orleans musician is fighting for his life in hospital after being brutally attacked in what is believed to be the latest case of a sick craze known as the knock-out game.

Doug Potter was returning to his car after playing a gig at Cafe Beignet inside the Bourbon Street courtyard venue on Tuesday night when he was brutally assaulted by two men.

The 54-year-old bass player is now in an induced coma after undergoing intensive brain surgery at University Hospital. 

Mr Potter was not robbed and witnesses say the two attackers appeared to have assaulted him for no apparent reason.

Friends
 and family believe he could have been the victim of what is known 
as the knock-out game, when attackers try to floor a victim purely for 
amusement.

The attack was 
captured on surveillance video which shows Mr Potter walking back to his
 car parked on nearby Conti Street. He is attacked by the two men and 
falls to the street.

Police 
have issued a sketch of one of the suspects who has a distinctive tattoo
 between his eyes like a letter W with a cross above it.

He is described as a black man and about 5â€™07â€
