Debenhams has made a step forward in promoting body confidence by becoming the first high-street retailer to permanently introduce size 16 mannequins.

The new mannequins, which were trialled by the high street store three years ago, will be used at its shop in Oxford Street, London.

They will appear alongside size 10 
dummies on all women's fashion floors, before being rolled out across 
all 170 of Debenhams' UK stores.

Size 10 is the standard size for mannequins on the high street, a far cry from the dimensions of the average British woman.

Debenhams
 director Ed Watson said: 'The average British woman is a size 16, but 
the high street has been showing them clothing on a mannequin that is 
three sizes smaller - until now.

Promoting body confidence? Debenhams becomes first mainstream high street store to introduce size 16 mannequins

Profit boost: Debenhams found that shoppers are three times more likely to buy an item if it is displayed on a mannequin with their body shape

'Having worked on this project for three years, we hope that it will help people in some small way to feel comfortable about their bodies and, crucially, that other retailers will follow.'

The move was backed by equalities minister Jo Swinson, who has led a Government drive to promote body confidence among women.

She said: 'The images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it's as if there's only one way of being beautiful. Yet nine in ten people say they would like to see a broader range of body shapes shown in advertising and the media.

Incentive to buy: MP Jo Swinson said at today's unveiling that women are three times more likely to purchase clothes when the fashion models are their size

'That's why the Government has fought
 hard to challenge our looks-obsessed culture. Our Body Confidence 
campaign has been working with the retail industry and others to 
encourage a diverse range of models.

'Recent
 research found that women are three times more likely to buy clothes 
when the fashion models are their size, so I hope more retailers will 
recognise that meeting customer demand for more diversity makes good 
business sense.

Larger mannequins are being blamed for undermining the nation's obesity crisis. Mr Miller, who has eight years experience helping people lose weight, blamed 'political correctness for keeping people fat', claiming society need to use shock tactics to tackle the problem

Defying conventions: Debenhams banned airbrushing on a swimwear 
campaign in 2010 (L) shows a model before and after airbrushing (R) in a

Fashionable diversity: In April, Debenhams unveiled 
its amazing new diversity campaign featuring the likes of Paralympian 
amputee Stefanie Reid

'Many customers want to see more realistic images in magazines, TV and on the high street, and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is one way of helping to achieve this.'

Debenhams has a history of defying conventional fashion promotion, using a disabled model when it launched its Principles range, banning airbrushing on swimwear advertising and running a lingerie campaign featuring a model over 50.
