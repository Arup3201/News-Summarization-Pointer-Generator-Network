A 21-year-old woman who was shot twice in the head and once in the abdomen by her ex-boyfriend has revealed her inspiring recovery as she learns to walk and talk again.

Alyssa Dudley, from St Petersburg, Florida, was left for dead by Carlos Crompton, 39, after he shot her in her apartment on July 16 - but she fought for her life.

She remains in Bayfront Medical Center, where she undergoes daily physical therapy and has now walked her first steps for the first time since the shooting.

'She makes progress every day,' her mother Diana told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Every single day.'

Fighter: Alyssa Dudley, 21, gives her father, Eddie Dudley, a tired thumbs up as she takes a break before another therapy session in hospital - six weeks after she was shot in the head by an ex-boyfriend

The progress continues weeks after her Crompton forced his way into her apartment just days after she broke off their three-year relationship.

The couple had met through friends and although Crompton, who had been arrested years prior on drugs charges, was considerably older than Alyssa, her family accepted him.

'We knew she was mature, independent 
and very responsible,' her mother said. 'We knew she was sick of the 
games guys her age would play. We wanted to give her space.'

But he was unable to find steady work and Alyssa supported both of them with her job at an assisted living home. She broke up with him in July, took back her apartment keys and changed her number.

Determined: Alyssa, who wears a helmet to protect her head during physical therapy sessions, has now started to walk again and can say some words. Her mother said she makes progress daily

She was at her apartment with a friend and the friend's teenage daughter when he entered the apartment and shot her three times. He then drove to his family's house where he shot at responding police officers and they returned fire, killing him.

Surgeons at Bayfront Health worked throughout the night to remove the bullet and shattered bone from Alyssa's brain.

Three days later, she woke up - and could only open and blink her eyes. But slowly, she began to recognize her family and move the left side of her body.

But when doctors removed a tube from her throat, she was unable to speak.

'Until one morning,' he mother Diana 
Dudley told the Tampa Bay Times. 'I asked her how she was doing. I 
almost cried when she said, "Good. Good".'

Before the shooting: Alyssa worked at an assisted living home and lived in her own St Petersburg apartment

Shooter: She is pictured left with ex-boyfriend Carlos Crompton, 39, who shot her twice in the head and once in the abdomen. Crompton, also pictured right, was shot dead by police when he opened fire on them

She can now speak short words and sentences, but has not asked about her ex-boyfriend. Two weeks ago, she began working with speech pathologists and physical theapists and can now move the right side of her body.

Before the shooting, she had moved into her own apartment, bought her own car, worked at an assisted living home and enjoyed making personalized t-shirts for her friends. But doctors remain uncertain about how much independence she can hope for in the future.

Dr. Steven Scott, a trauma expert at the 
James A. Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa, told the Tampa Bay Times that every brain injury is different.

'Victims 
of brain trauma do much better when they're surrounded by the love of 
family,' he said. 'I believe compassion and caring will do more than 
what we can do with medicine.'

The family is uncertain how they'll cover
the growing costs of the care; they have learned that Medicaid only 
covers 45 days of in-patient hospital bills.

Family: Her mother Diana spends much of the day with Alyssa, but is concerned about mounting bills

'Why do we have to deal with this?' Diana asked. 'Why are we faced with this problem?'

She referred to care received by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in January 2011.

'I can guarantee you the services were falling at her feet,' Diana said. 'I can gurantee you she had everything she needed to help her get better. What makes my daughter less important than her?'

She added that, despite having a weekly income of just $350: 'We're going to find a way. We have to be here. We want to give her a chance to live the best life possible.'

The family has set up a personal bank account for donations: Diana Dudley for the benefit of Alyssa Dudley, Florida Traditions Bank, 4301 Barclay Ave., Spring Hill, FL 34609, (352) 683-9708.
