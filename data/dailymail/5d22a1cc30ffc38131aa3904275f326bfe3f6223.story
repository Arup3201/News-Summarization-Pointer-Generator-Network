Kevin Pietersen has taken no prisoners in his new book KP: The Autobiography, which is due to be released on Thursday.

The former England batsman discusses his opinions on, among others, Matt Prior, Andrew Strauss, Andy Flower and Alastair Cook.

Here, Sportsmail's Paul Newman and Mike Dickson assess the damage.

MATT PRIOR @MattPrior13

'I’m looking forward to reading the full KP book. Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!! Obvs sad to see the accusations against me and I WILL have my right of reply! However today is not the day and Twitter is not the place!'

GEOFF MILLER, Former England selector

'There was no atmosphere of bullying within the England set-up. What we tried to do was pick the best squad to create the best atmosphere to win matches.'

GRAEME SWANN

'It’s codswallop...We had a magnificent team ethos and team spirit until Mitchell Johnson took his blindfold off and then it all fell apart …He has picked on people who he thinks can’t answer back.'

GARY LINEKER @GaryLineker

'The weather at my #FFLGolfDay is horrendous! I blame Andy Flower.'

JONATHAN AGNEW

'Pietersen claims Flower had it in for him for attempting to have him sacked in 2008. But Flower brought Pietersen back into the team following the scandal over texts to South Africans.'

CHRIS TREMLETT @ChrisTremlett

'Glad KP has finally been able to give his side of the story. People can now make an informed opinion of what went on.'

MICHAEL VAUGHAN @MichaelVaughan

'Many to blame but mostly a lack of communication and man-management. I will remember KP for what he was. A maverick who could play innings that no other England player could!'

On the ridiculing of Matt Prior

Pietersen’s one-time friend and fellow South Africa-raised player is heavily criticised even though - or maybe even because - Matt Prior was the player who tried to broker a peace deal after the ‘textgate’ revelations in 2012.

Prior is sneeringly referred to as ‘The Big Cheese’, or simply ‘Cheese’, throughout the book, a reference to the nickname Pietersen alleges the wicketkeeper used to describe himself in the early part of his career. In continuing the theme he says Prior was ‘a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie’.

Pietersen also ridicules Prior, a huge cycling enthusiast, for taking his bike on tour to New Zealand and writes: ‘Here’s a thing about playing cricket at the other end of the world. You don’t need to take your bike with you. They have bikes in New Zealand.

‘Who the hell takes a bike? If Cheese wasn’t a top genius cricketer Cheese would have been a world-class cyclist. Obviously.’

Most seriously, Prior is described as ‘a classroom bully’ whom Pietersen attacks as ‘not captaincy material or even vice-captaincy material’.

On build-up to last winter’s Ashes

Rather like Shane Warne, Pietersen was not a fan of camps held before going away on tour and he felt no differently about the one held before leaving for the Australia tour in late 2013.

‘The pre-Ashes camp was the biggest shambles. Bonding? No. Boredom? Absolutely. It was one of the most frustrating periods of my life, purely because I knew I wouldn’t see my lad for however long when we were on tour and we were here doing this nonsense.’

Pietersen was not impressed by the pre-Ashes training camp which ensured he was away from his son

On wanting to slap Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad

Pietersen was unimpressed when, as the team gathered, the two bowlers were dead set against the point made by skipper Andrew Strauss that they should ease off criticising fielders when they had made a mistake.

‘They felt that bowlers were well within their rights to be angry and aggressive towards the fielders.

‘I just stood there and realised that it was the closest I’ve ever come to thinking I could willingly slap two guys on my own team.’

On wanting to ‘mute’ Nick Knight

Pietersen had a long-standing antagonism towards the former England batsman and now commentator Nick Knight, who he felt used information gleaned from the dressing room against him, and settles a score in the book.

‘He shows a better sense of balance sitting on the fence all the time than he ever did on a cricket pitch. The game moves at an incredible pace but Knight is one of those commentators you actually mute because he’s just so boring.’

On criticising James Taylor

KP did not feel that the diminutive batsman was ready for international duty when called up for his debut in the Headingley Test against South Africa, and was not afraid to make his feelings known, although he insists this was done in private.

‘I have nothing against James but the fact is, at five feet six, he’s one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket. His Dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest attack in world cricket, I didn’t think he was up to it. I rang and asked Andy Flower, in my usual sweet way, how on earth have you picked Taylor?’

On the ‘KP GENIUS’ twitter account

Pietersen claims that the hurt he felt over a parody Twitter account in his name led to him breaking down in tears in front of Andy Flower and led to his infamous ‘it’s difficult being me’ comment after the Headingley Test of 2012.

Flower's regime led to cliques (and Trott telling Prior and Swann to 'f*** off') 

Flower was a 'f****** horrendous' 'Mood Hoover' 

Pietersen was in a depressed state after being subject to the mocking spoof Twitter account and felt isolated from the rest of the dressing room. He says he was a broken man but maintained that the exchange of messages with South Africa players was blown out of all proportion when he spoke to Andrew Strauss about it.

‘We had a fine big ding dong. He accused me of having done it. I admitted that I had been in communication with the South Africans. Yes, but it was nothing bad. These guys are friends. You guys have been treating me like sh** for years. You’ve been acting like a d*** to me. I went through example after example.’

On his deteriorating Strauss relationship

The two had been close friends in the team before the Middlesex man was given the captaincy and there was soon a frosting of relations when they got to the West Indies in Strauss’s first tour as skipper.

‘A week into his captaincy he told me in the Caribbean that I couldn’t go home and see my family at a really tough time in my life. The way he conducted himself, the distance he put between us straight away: I just didn’t think that Straussy was my kind of guy any more.’

On Swann and reintegration

At one of the meetings to rehabilitate him back into the team Graeme Swann made it clear he was not happy that he had been dragged to Oxford for a meeting at a time when his wife was about to give birth. Pietersen was unimpressed by his reaction.

‘I just thought Swanny, you sad, sad bastard. If you don’t want to be here don’t come. You are a grown man, your wife is having a baby. But if Andy Flower calls you somewhere you just go?’

On Alastair Cook and how it all ended

The England captain is portrayed condescendingly as a bumbling Yes man who fitted the squeaky-clean image the ECB want from its leader.

‘Cooky hates conflict,’ writes Pietersen. ‘He’s another Mr Nice Guy - like Ned Flanders from The Simpsons.’

Of the meeting which ended Pietersen’s England career, he writes: ‘Cook shakes my hand but he doesn’t want to look at me. He looks at the floor. I feel sorry for him.’

The England captain has since privately insisted that he was ready to speak with Pietersen about the reasons for his demise at that meeting, but that Pietersen walked out without seeking an explanation.

That is contested by Pietersen who insists that, even though he left the meeting after barely five minutes, he only did so after saying: ‘Is that it?’

He then headed straight to his lawyer to negotiate his pay-off.
