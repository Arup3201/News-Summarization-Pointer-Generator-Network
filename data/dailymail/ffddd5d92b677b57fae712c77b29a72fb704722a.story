A Colorado man has been arrested on kidnapping charges after police found a 14-year-old girl at his apartment nearly two weeks after she disappeared from her parents' home in Connecticut.

A frantic search had been underway since Aug. 25, when Hartford teen Jillian Burgos first vanished.

Family and friends held candlelight vigils and posted flyers seeking the girl, her parents distraught by her disappearance.

Then on Wednesday, Colorado authorities found her at the Longmont apartment of Timothy Wind, 53, Westword reported.

Police said she was in safe and good condition, according to WFSB.

Wind has been charged with second-degree kidnapping and Internet exploitation.

Police say he traveled from Longmont to Hartford and back with Jillian.

She was believed to have been with him the entire time.

Police say Wind met Jillian on the Internet, WCIT reported.

But it remains unclear if Wind forced Jillian to go or if she went voluntarily.

Jillian was last seen about 2pm on Aug. 25 when she asked her dad to go outside, the Hartford Courant reported. 

The father told her to stay in the backyard — but she disappeared shortly after.

The family said she had few possessions with her when she vanished. Relatives believed her to have been lured from the home, according to the Courant.
