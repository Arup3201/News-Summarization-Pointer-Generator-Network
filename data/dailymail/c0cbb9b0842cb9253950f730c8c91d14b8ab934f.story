Stewart Downing is in a happy place right now. The West Ham attacker scored his third goal of the season to earn a well-deserved point and prompted manager Sam Allardyce to renew calls for his inclusion with England. 

Allardyce was not best pleased with the England medical staff when they gave Downing an injection to get him through the first half of last month’s 3-1 win against Scotland.

But his poor showing that night should not preclude future involvement, says his boss.

Sam Allardyce believes there aren't too many playing at the same level as Downing in the Premier League

‘He shouldn’t have played for England because he had been injected after getting a problem with his knee,’ he said. ‘It didn’t do him any favours as he wasn’t 100 per cent fit. I don’t think anyone should judge Stewie on what happened for 45 minutes against Scotland.

‘I think he should get the opportunity to go again and if he plays like he did (on Saturday) then there are not too many playing as well as Stewart Downing at the moment in the Premier League.’

The player himself believes he and the Hammers – currently in fourth – are headed for European football.

‘I haven’t enjoyed my football as much as this since I was at Aston Villa,’ he said. ‘It’s a very similar feel to Villa, the same sort of team - counter-attacking with pace and power. There is a good dressing room where everyone chips in. You can see we’re playing with confidence.

‘Villa finished in the top six and if we keep playing the way we are, so can we. We’ve got a hell of a chance.’ Downing, then, is looking towards a bright future. For Poyet, the outlook is somewhat bleak.

Gus Poyet is frustrated that Sunderland failed to sign players who can make the difference last summer

In contrast to the buoyant Downing, Sunderland boss Gus Poyet confessed that he was not enjoying himself.

Not only that, he admitted that perhaps he isn’t the man to bring about a change of fortune, even forecasting a campaign of boredom in the months ahead.

In short, Poyet is frustrated; frustrated with a side which lacks imagination and verve, frustrated that the club – led by sporting director Lee Congerton - have failed to provide him with players who can make the difference.

‘I want to do better and I want people to feel better. I am not enjoying this,’ said the Uruguayan, whose side have now drawn 10 of their 16 matches this season. ‘I enjoy it when I win, but when I draw too many I don't enjoy it. Maybe the problem is me, it is my character. Maybe it is not possible. Maybe we will need to wait three years (before we start winning).

‘The easiest way to solve all these problems is to get a player who can make the difference on his own. We don’t have one at the moment. Unless someone wins player of the month like Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson did last season, it is going to be boring draws all the time.’

Poyet says he is not enjoying himself and does not want to be drawing every week

Jozy Altidore missed a superb chance for the hosts and has been urged to forget about it by Steven Fletcher

January, you feel, could be a make-or-break month for the disenchanted South American. He started with USA striker Jozy Altidore on Saturday, the £6.5million flop who had scored once in 41 Premier League appearances. 

Make that 42. He was guilty of a glaring miss when swiping at fresh air three yards from an open goal to extend his top-flight drought to one year and one week.

‘It could have changed the game,’ said Steven Fletcher, the man left out at Altidore’s expense. ‘But it happens to all of us – he’s got to forget about it quickly.’ The score was 1-1 at the time, the outstanding Stewart Downing having cancelled out Jordi Gomez’s penalty, awarded when Adam Johnson dived under minimal contact from James Tomkins.
