A fiance hanged himself just months before he was due to get married after suffering a 'bad trip' triggered by recreational use of cocaine, an inquest heard today.

Window fitter David Curson, 23, described as 'happy-go-lucky' by family and colleagues, had been excitedly preparing for his wedding to fiancee Anne-Marie Johnson, an inquest in Bolton was told.

The couple had been planning to buy a house together and the night before he died Mr Curson had been looking at mortgage options.

But the inquest was told that the occasional cocaine user - who had agreed to give it up at the request of his fiancee - had taken the drug again while house-sitting for his mother.

As the effects wore off he was plunged into a lethally depressive 'comedown', the coroner heard.

He was found dead by his father John the following day after a work colleague was unable to raise him, with a note by his side.

Coroner Jennifer Leeming ruled Mr Curson may not have intended to take his own life, and recorded a narrative verdict. 

The hearing was told that 'happy-go-lucky' Mr Curson, from Golborne, near Wigan, enjoyed his job and was a good worker, 

In a statement his fiancee Miss Johnson said the couple were planning to buy a house together and added: 'His death has come as such a shock. I do not understand why he would take his own life. I loved him very much. He was a lovely man.'

She said Mr Curson had told her he occasionally took cocaine but she had asked him to stop. 

The hearing was told that 'happy-go-lucky' Mr Curson, from Golborne, near Wigan, enjoyed his job and was engaged. The couple were said to have been 'very happy and were planning to their future together'

She added: 'David was certainly not a regular user and because you were very much against it he said he would not use it again. You tell me that there was not a reason that you were aware of that he would take his own life.'

She said she last saw her fiancée the day before he died on October 28 said said 'everything was absolutely fine' and that they had even spoken about applying for a mortgage. 

Mr Curson's work colleague Brian Collard said the pair had had a couple of beers together the night before Mr Curson died and that he had wanted some financial advice about his credit rating. 

He said: 'I got on very well with David. He was a very good worker. He liked to have laugh and a joke. I would describe him as a happy-go-lucky person. I did not think he had a care in the world and I did not think he was likely to be easily depressed.

'He wanted some financial advice. He had seen a house he liked and he was considering a mortgage for the house he wanted for himself and his fiancée.

'He wanted to know how to access his credit rating before he made an appointment with the bank. He seemed normal not anxious or stressed. Because we had a close friendship I feel if he had felt worried, he probably would have said something to me.'

The inquest was told he started taking the drug again while house-sitting for his mother and as the effects wore off he was plunged into a lethally depressive 'comedown'. A coroner recorded a narrative verdict

Dr Naveen Sharma, a consultant histopathologist, said tests showed alcohol and cocaine in Mr Curson's system and said: 'It was clearly recent - in the house leading up to his death. It is difficult to say if it had any effect on the state of his mind. It is dependent on the tolerance of the individual. Cocaine has an accelerant affect and a comedown affect. It depends on tolerance.

'Sometimes people comedown quite sharply in relation to the com down effect of cocaine. If everybody agrees that is a conclusion in the absence of any other explanation. '

In a statement Mr Curson's father John said: 'David's death is inexplicable and came as a terrible shock to all his friends and family. The loss of David is so hard to bear. We are all devastated by his death.

'This has affected not only his family but all those close friends who lived him very much. I could not have asked for a better son. He had everything going for him. He was a happy-go-lucky man and had such a bright future ahead of him.'

Recording a narrative verdict, Miss Leeming said: 'I do not think he was taking cocaine regularly and that is part of the issue. I do not think people understand that if you have a 'bad trip' as it was called in the 60s they do not understand how dangerous it can be in terms of your mental state.

'What happened here seems to be completely inexplicable and I just wonder whether his mind was affect by the depressive effect of the cocaine bearing in mind there is no other possible explanation for why this has happened.

'The problem is when people take cocaine they think are fine. They think this is fine, this is okay. If you say to people who take it recreationally "you are putting yourself at risk" they say "no I am fine. I just take it every Friday."

'People do not understand the risk of the depressive affect from one particular batch. In the same way they do not understand the risk of overdose because of having a particularly pure batch. I do wonder if it had some effect on his mind. This is a gentleman who had no reason to end his life.'

She added: 'There is really no other way to put other than to say he hanged himself because that is what happened but the state of his mind when he did it is unclear. 

'To record that someone took their own life I have to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that they understood what they were doing and intended the act. I cannot be satisfied by that here beyond all reasonable doubt.' 

According the national drug education service FRANK, users of cocaine experience a long 'comedown' as the effects of the drug wear off and they feel depressed and run down. This crash can happen for days afterwards
