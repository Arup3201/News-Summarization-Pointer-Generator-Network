A British-made electric motorcycle claims to be the first clean tech motorbike that can compete with other less environmentally friendly speedy bikes.

The team behind the green motorbike has taken to the wide open roads of the U.S. this week to showcase its technology as part of a UK trade mission.

Agility Global claims it has created a 100 per cent clean electric bike as an alternative to the conventional petrol-guzzling performance bike.

The London-based business has transported its flagship model, pictured, to Colorado to drum up interest in the motorbike-loving American market as it is looking for angel funding and needs investment to expand

The Saietta R, which means 'thunderbolt' in Apennine Italian, can go from 0 to 60mph in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of 80mph.

The bike is 80 per cent charged in an hour, uses a high-torque electric motor and can cover 74 miles (120km) in one charge, the company said.

Its sleek, futuristic design means it would not look out of place in a James Bond film and the company’s founder said he has already had interest from a number of film franchises.

The company's founder describes the bike as the 'world's first high-performance, clean tech motorcycle'

The firm was founded by former marine Lawrence Marazzi who, after returning from Afghanistan, decided to go back to his roots in Formula 1 and aerospace design.

He describes the bike as the ‘world's first high-performance, clean tech motorcycle’.

Mr Marazzi, 42, said the firm has been working with next generation electric technology over the past five years.

‘What sets us apart from our competitors is that we have started our design on a clean sheet of paper and the bike is not just derived from the format of traditional motorbikes, which makes us higher performance than a petrol bike,’ he said.

The London-based business has transported its flagship model to Colorado to drum up interest in the motorbike-loving American market as it is looking for angel funding and needs investment to expand.

Mr Marazzi said feedback so far on the trade mission had been ‘phenomenal’.

‘It's impossible to go anywhere without causing people to stop and stare - it's a real conversation starter,’ he said.

‘We have been inundated with interest so far but what we need now is to grow.’

Agility Global is one of 16 British companies that were selected to be part of the week-long 'clean and cool mission' to Colorado, which is one of the fastest-emerging clean technology centres in the U.S.

Supported by UK Trade and Investment and the Technology Strategy Board, the party is made up of some of the most promising UK entrepreneurs and early stage businesses in the industry.
