The boss of bungling Olympic security firm G4S could receive a £16million leaving package after spectacularly quitting his post last night.

Nick Buckles presided over a ‘humiliating shambles’ after the company failed to train enough guards for last summer’s Games, causing 3,500 soldiers to be called in to plug the gaps.

Yet despite public outrage and calls from MPs for him to resign, he clung on as chief executive.

Gone: G4S's chief executive Nick Buckles (pictured yesterday) resigned, just months after the firm's Olympics 'shambles'

The debacle was one in a string of 
scandals for his leadership that included a botched £5billion takeover 
in 2011 and a warning about profitability earlier this month.

Now Mr Buckles, who had been with the 
company for 28 years and was known in the City as a flamboyant 
character, is set to pocket millions when he leaves next week.

The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901.

G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including:

In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks

A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4

In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt

Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001

In
2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over 
Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher 
Lowcock's artificial limb

In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave

In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out
of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive'

His annual pay packet was £1.2million – including £336,000 in lieu of pension payments – which he will receive when he leaves.

Mr Buckles, who is married with a son 
and two daughters, also built up a pension pot valued at £9.5million at 
the end of last year. The 51-year-old has also amassed a hoard of 
company shares under long-term incentive schemes which would normally 
take years to mature.

But he may be granted these for free, 
adding £4.5million more to his leaving package, at the discretion of the
group’s pay committee.

In addition there are another 370,000 
shares under a separate remuneration scheme, which he would also be 
likely to receive, worth a further £926,000.

Mr Buckles was slammed by MPs for ‘making it up as he went along’ in the run-up to the Games.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home 
affairs select committee, said: ‘I am not surprised by Mr Buckles’ 
decision to leave the company. I had expected this a year ago. I am 
astonished by the level of his farewell package.’

G4S had been appointed by the 
Government to provide 10,400 guards for the Games – but admitted it 
could not meet the demand just days before the Opening Ceremony. The 
Army was called in, but even then some venues had insufficient staff.

During the Games almost two thirds of 
venues were left with a 15 per cent deficit in guard numbers. MPs called
for G4S to be blacklisted from future Government work.

But despite being hauled before MPs twice, Mr Buckles kept his post – while a number of deputies lost their jobs.

The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games

Mr Buckles was grilled by MPs over the Olympics contract last year

In November, the group was stripped of
one of its prisons by the Ministry of Justice following a tender 
process.

At the time G4S insisted the events were not linked, but City 
analysts questioned whether the group could win big Whitehall contracts 
with Mr Buckles – who once claimed never to have read a book, saying 
‘I’m not really a book person’ – still at the helm.

Since the Games it has not won a major state contract.

Earlier this month the company said 
its annual profits would be lower than expectations – a bombshell which 
sent the group’s shares plunging. Sources say it was the last straw for 
investors.
