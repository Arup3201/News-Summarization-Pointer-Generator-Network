Arsene Wenger has hit back at Alisher Usmanov’s claim that he is holding Arsenal back. 

Usmanov, the Russian who owns 30 per cent of the Gunners, suggested on Monday that the manager’s 'restrictive principles' are becoming problematic for the club and that the Frenchman is making mistakes but not accepting them.

But ahead of his side’s Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, Wenger aimed a jibe back at the Russian business tycoon.

'First of all, the 18 years I have been here I have shown that I can take criticism and everybody has the right to have an opinion,' he said. 

‘Having said that, we have values at this club. The first one is when we go through a difficult patch, we show solidarity. That is a very important one.

‘The second one is that, when you have something to say to each other, we say it face-to-face. We don’t need to go to the newspapers.’ 

Alisher Usmanov, Arsenal's second-highest shareholder, has been critical of Wenger's principles

Usmanov also claimed that Wenger must strengthen in every single position to compete for trophies.

Arsenal’s second-highest shareholder believes the club are falling behind Chelsea and Manchester City and the continent's biggest sides, and he sees loosening the purse strings the only way to bridge the gap.

'I don’t take it personally at all,' Wenger added. 'It is an opinion that I respect but when you’re from this club, you’re from this club. You’re in or out, you cannot be both.

'What is important is how close we are together inside the club and how much we can respond to people who question our quality.

'I personally feel that there’s a very strong bond inside the team and the club, and that this team will have a very strong season. I am ready to bet with you on that.'
