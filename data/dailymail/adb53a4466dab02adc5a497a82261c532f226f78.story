Nasa’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite was getting ready to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California today at 10:56am BST (05.56 EST).

But the launch was cancelled, despite Nasa saying there was a zero per cent chance of failure, when a water flow problem was discovered.

The next launch window for OCO-2, which will be the first dedicated Nasa mission to monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide on global scales, could be as early as tomorrow.

The satellite had to be launched at exactly the right time to ensure it entered the right orbit.

The issue was with the pulse suppression water system.

This protects the launch mount holding the rocket from the high temperatures of a launch.

And it helps protect from the shockwave of ignition from the engine.

The water flow would have begun at T-minus 45 seconds.

But when it was found not to be working properly, the launch had to be cancelled for safety reasons.

The soonest next launch could be tomorrow in what is known as a '24 hour recycle'.

This will bring it in line with a series of other Earth-observing satellites known as the ‘A-train’.

In fact, the orbit is so precise that there is only a 30 second launch window within which it can take off; any delays and Nasa will have to try again another day.

That is the reason why today's launch was cancelled, as the problem delayed the rocket lifting off by more than 30 seconds.

Launch cancellations of this sort are not uncommon though.

Rockets are a very dangerous business, so great care must be taken before attempting a launch and a host of safety checks must be met.

Even the most minor of faults can lead to a cancellation; after all, Nasa and other agencies would rather delay a launch by a day or two than lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment.

Just a week ago, for example, private company SpaceX delayed the launch of its own Falcon 9 rocket when an issue was discovered that threatened the success of the flight.

OCO-2 (illustration shown) is Nasa's first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in Earth's climate according to Nasa. It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day

Nasa 
Launch Manager Tim Dunn of the agency's Launch Services Program had 
previously told the launch team this morning that the countdown and 
conditions 'look very, very good'.

Lift-off (zero seconds): Three solid rocket motors are ignited.

100 seconds after launch: The solid rocket motors are jettisoned as the rocket climbs to space.

Four minutes: Main engine is cut off.

Four minutes and eight seconds: Rocket splits in two as the stages separate.

Five minutes: Nose cone opens up.

10 minutes: Second engine cuts out (Seco-1).

11 minutes: The satellite coasts in space for 40 minutes.

51 minutes: A second engine fires to place the satellite into the right orbit.

56 minutes: Final rocket engine separates from the satellite.

45 days: First science observations of carbon dioxide levels on Earth begin.

When the launch does take place, OCO-2 will be carried into space by the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket.

It is the second of five Nasa Earth 
science missions to be launched this year.

Nasa monitors Earth's vital 
signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and 
airborne and ground-based observation campaigns.

OCO-2
 is Nasa’s first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon 
dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in 
Earth’s climate according to Nasa.

It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day.

Of these, about 100,000 are expected to be sufficiently cloud free to provide highly usable carbon dioxide data.

The
 best carbon dioxide-observing satellite currently in orbit takes 4 
seconds to make one such observation and collects fewer than 20,000 
pieces of data per day, with about 500 of those being highly useful.

OCO-2 studies carbon dioxide by looking at the colors (or wavelengths) of sunlight that carbon dioxide absorbs.

To identify very small changes in this absorption from one wavelength to the next, the OCO-2 instrument separates light into many narrow bands of wavelengths.

But OCO-2's field of view is only about one 
square mile (three square kilometers) - smaller than New York City's 
Central Park.

This allows it to dodge clouds, which regularly cover 
about two-thirds of Earth; even a tiny wisp of cloud in OCO-2's view
 compromises the measurement.

Six to seven weeks after launch, OCO-2 will be maneuvered into its final operational orbit in the A-Train constellation, 438 miles (705 kilometers) above Earth.

And the first science observations of carbon dioxide levels on our planet are slated to begin about 45 days after launch.

Technicians are seen making last minute preparations before the launch of the rocket. Nasa had said there was zero chance of the launch being cancelled today. OCO-2 will be able to pinpoint where the planet's forests and ocean are reabsorbing atmospheric carbon, a cycle that is key to Earth's temperature

'Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a critical role in our planet's 
energy balance and is a key factor in understanding how our climate is 
changing,' said Michael Freilich, director of Nasa’s Earth Science 
Division in Washington.

'With the OCO-2 mission, Nasa will be 
contributing an important new source of global observations to the 
scientific challenge of better understanding our Earth and its future.'

Michael Gunson, OCO-2 project scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, added: 'Knowing what parts of Earth are helping remove carbon from our atmosphere will help us understand whether they will keep doing so in the future.

'Understanding the processes controlling carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will help us predict how fast it will build up in the future.

'Data from this mission will help scientists reduce uncertainties in forecasts of how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere and improve the accuracy of global climate change predictions.'

The spacecraft will sample the global geographic distribution of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and allow scientists to study their changes over time more completely than can be done with any existing data.

Since 2009, Earth scientists have been preparing for OCO-2 by taking advantage of observations from the Japanese Gosat satellite.

OCO-2 replaces a nearly identical Nasa spacecraft lost because of a rocket launch mishap in February 2009.

That was when the original Orbiting Carbon Observatory failed to separate during ascent, and subsequently re-entered the atmosphere, crashing into the Indian Ocean near Antarctica.

At approximately 400 parts per million, atmospheric carbon dioxide is now at its highest level in at least the past 800,000 years, according to Nasa.

The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are currently adding nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, producing an unprecedented buildup in this greenhouse gas.

OCO-2 measurements will be combined with data from ground stations, aircraft and other satellites to help answer questions about the processes that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and its role in Earth’s climate and carbon cycle.

Mission data will also help assess the usefulness of space-based measurements of carbon dioxide for monitoring emissions.
