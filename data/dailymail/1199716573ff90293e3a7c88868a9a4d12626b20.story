Bill Cosby's allies are dropping like flies, but the alma mater he so famously adores is not one of among them.

Temple University says Cosby remains a trustee of the Philadelphia institution despite renewed scrutiny of sexual assault allegations against him.

At least three women have publicly discussed their allegations against Cosby in recent weeks.

When asked by philly.com, Temple officials' answer was brief and gave no hint of how the arrangement could change in the future.

'Bill Cosby is currently a member of the board of a trustees,' said the spokesperson.

Through his lawyer, the 77-year-old comedian has strongly denied wrongdoing. Cosby has never been charged.

Cosby, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, is Temple's most famous alum and has been a trustee since 1982. The entertainer often speaks at commencement, drawing huge cheers.

In 2006, Cosby settled a lawsuit filed by a former Temple employee who alleged he drugged and fondled her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. Cosby was represented by Patrick O'Connor, chairman of Temple's board of trustees.

Temple serves about 38,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The institution is one of the last still affiliated with the man who was once America's most adored TV dad.

NBC has scrapped a Cosby comedy that was under development and TV Land will stop airing reruns of 'The Cosby Show,' moves that came a day after another woman came forward claiming that the once-beloved comic had sexually assaulted her.

NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said Wednesday the Cosby sitcom 'is no longer under development.' A TV Land representative said the reruns will stop airing immediately for an indefinite time. 'The Cosby Show' also was to have been part of a Thanksgiving sitcom marathon.

The NBC sitcom and 'Cosby Show' reruns joined a Netflix Cosby standup comedy special, which was indefinitely postponed late Tuesday, as mounting evidence of Cosby's faltering career. 

They occurred a day after model Janice Dickinson, in an interview with 'Entertainment Tonight,' became the third woman in recent weeks to allege she'd been assaulted by Cosby - charges strongly denied by the comedian's lawyer.

The developments, which involve allegations that were widely reported a decade ago as well as new accusations, have gravely damaged the  comedian's reputation at a time when he was launching a comeback.

A year ago, a standup special - his first in 30 years - aired on Comedy Central and drew a hefty audience of 2 million viewers. His prospective new series was announced by NBC in January.
