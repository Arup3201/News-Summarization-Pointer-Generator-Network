Cesc Fabregas has been running the show in more ways than one this season.

The Chelsea star, who’s been an integral cog in Jose Mourinho’s winning machine, has covered more ground than any other player in the Premier League this season.

Indeed Fabregas became the first player to complete more than 100 miles in Chelsea’s 3-0 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday.

He has covered more than 100 miles this season with Chelsea unbeaten in their opening 14 matches 

Nemanja Matic and Jake Livermore are the only other players in the Premier League to run 100 miles this term

The Spaniard was swiftly joined on the list by his team-mate Nemanja Matic, the ever-impressive Serbia star who has starred since his arrival at Stamford Bridge in January, to hit the 100-mile barrier.

Hull’s Jake Livermore is the only other player to have surpassed the landmark this year – the midfielder reaching three figures in his side’s 1-1 draw against Everton on Wednesday.

It means the trio have averaged over seven miles in each Premier League game this season.

Southampton, Swansea and Newcastle each boast two players in the top 10 of  with Morgan Schneiderlin, Dusan Tadic, Ki Sung-yueng, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Daryl Janmaat and Jack Colback all featuring on the list. Stoke’s Steven Nzonzi also makes the top 10.

Ki Sung-yueng has covered 99 miles in the Premier League this season, which leaves him fourth on the list
