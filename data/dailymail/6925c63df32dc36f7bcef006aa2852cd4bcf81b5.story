If one good thing has come from the recession it's our newfound DIY expertise, as more of us commit to improving our own homes rather than employing others to do it for us.

But if, like most of us, you can't afford to pay a team of builders to rennovate your downstairs loo, it's unlikely you'll be able to afford the new Sir Terence Conran Tool Set and Cabinet.

Created to celebrate Sir Terence's 80th birthday, this luxury set costs a staggering £12,000.

Sir Terence Conran Tool Set and Cabinet - yours for £12,000

Sir Terence is one of the world's most beloved and well-known designers, and has helped shape the aesthetic of British homes for over 50 years.

Designed by Benchmark, the box includes instruments for marking and measuring, a set of Ashley Iles chisels, planes, saws and scarpers by Lie-Nielsen, and traditional hammers and screwdrivers.

The handmade cabinet is made to order and takes 10-12 weeks for shipping, which costs up to £100 in the UK.

This beautiful toolbox is a special piece and makes a stylish gift for those who enjoy DIY. But we'd rather save the £12k towards our home improvements, if it's all the same to you, Terence.
