Arsenal goalkeeper Damian Martinez was ready to leave the club next summer - but now believes he can steal Wojciech Szczęsny's place as their No 1.

The 22-year-old kept his third clean sheet in a row, after replacing the injured Szczesny, in their win against Southampton.

But Martinez feared for his future after Arsene Wenger signed David Ospina in the summer and he was seemingly relegated to third choice.

Martinez said: 'I spoke to my agent and my family about it and they said "let's wait one year to see if you get the opportunity, don't rush it"

'I was still young - I was only 21, I just turned 22 - and I think I did good to stay here. I got the opportunity that my agent and family told me, so I am really pleased about that.

'Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world so I am in no rush to leave. I love this club.'

Szczesny has not played since injuring his hip against Manchester United and Ospina has been ruled out until 2015.

In their absence Martinez, who has had loan spells at Oxford and Sheffield Wednesday since he joined the club in 2011, impressed against Borussia Dortmund and West Bromwich Albion.

Asked if he felt he could now become Wenger's first-choice goalkeeper, he replied: 'Yeah, Wojciech has got the spot when he is not injured and doing a good job as well.

'Hopefully if I get a chance against Stoke, I will keep a clean sheet and we can win the game.' I am not too sure if I play Under-21s anymore because I need to be fit to play first-team.

'I am just thinking about the next game and in the future we will see.'

Damian Emiliano Martinez hails from Mar Del Plata in Argentina and joined Arsenal from Independiente as an 18-year-old in 2010.

The 6ft 4in stopper, now 22, was moved into Arsenal's first-team squad in 2012 and made his debut in the 7-5 League Cup win at Reading on September 26.

He spent much of the 2013-2014 campaign on loan at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 15 appearances.

Returning to the Emirates for the current season, he made his debut away to Anderlecht in the Champions League and has stayed in the side following injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina.

Martinez has previously represented Argentina at Under 17 and Under 20 level.
