Embattled Cabinet minister Maria Miller today insisted she will pay capital gains tax on the sale of the £1.4million house part-funded by the taxpayer.

The Culture Secretary faced fresh questions about her finances as it emerged she stopped claiming expenses on the south London home just as parliamentary officials were demanding MPs sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax incurred on future sales.

Mrs Miller bought the house almost 20 years ago, claimed expenses on it for four years and sold it for a profit of more than £1million in February this year.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has vowed to pay capital gains tax on her house sale as the row over he expenses refuses to go away

Mrs Miller’s position in the Cabinet has become increasingly precarious after she was forced to apologise to the Commons and pay back £5,800.

David Cameron has refused to sack her, despite a poll showing 78 per cent of people think Mrs Miller should be fired.

Last week the independent standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson said Mrs Miller had overclaimed for expenses on her mortgage by £45,000.

But in a dispute about the rules at the time, Miss Hudson was overruled by MPs on the Commons Standards Committee which said she need repay only £5,800.

Mrs Miller caused further outrage with a 32-second apology to the comments, after she was criticised for her attitude to the year-long inquiry into her claims.

When the expenses scandal broke in 2009, several MPs were accused of ‘flipping’ the declaration of their second home in order to avoid capital gains tax.

Sales of a main home do not carry capital gains tax, but it is levied at 28 per cent on profits made on second homes.

It was legal for MPs to declare one property as a second home for expenses, but as a main home for tax purposes.

In May 2009 Parliamentary officials wrote to MPs asking them to sign a declaration that they would pay any capital gains tax due.

But weeks before Mrs Miller instead stopped claiming for any expenses on the Wimbledon property she shared with her parents.

She later designated the London house as her main home and from 2011 claimed expenses on a property in her Basingstoke constituency.

A spokesman for the Culture Secretary said: ‘This is nonsense. It is well documented that Maria stopped claiming any accommodation allowance at all in April 2009.

The sale of the Wimbledon property in February, falls in a tax year that has not yet been assessed. She will of course deal with the matter in accordance with HMRC rules and pay any tax that is due.'

Aides deny Mrs Miller ‘flipped’ her designation in order to avoid capital gains tax, noting that she stopped claiming expenses on the London house five years ago.

However, the row has reignited public anger over the expenses scandal and fuelled calls for her to be sacked.

Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit became the most senior Conservative to call for her to go, writing on the Telegraph website that her ‘arrogant’ handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over MPs' expenses and adding: ‘The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.’

A poll by Survation for the Mail on Sunday found that large majorities of voters believe she should forfeit her Cabinet post (78 per cent) or be sacked as MP for Basingstoke (68 per cent).

Expenses watchdog Sir Ian Kennedy, chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said it was time for MPs to stop ‘marking their own homework’ and give Ms Hudson the final say in standards investigations.

And Labour's shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle promised a shake-up if the party wins next year's election: ‘We need a system which commands public confidence, and what we have at the moment clearly doesn't do that.

Prime Minister David Cameron had vowed to stand by Mrs Miller and refused to sack her but his judgment was came into question from other Tories

‘We need reform so that people have faith that MPs are properly held to account. David Cameron has failed to act but Labour won't let this failing system go unreformed.’

But Standards Committee member Geoffrey Cox warned that handing the right to sanction MPs to an external regulator could raise constitutional issues, as the watchdog could have the power to change the shape of a government - particularly in times of a narrow majority - by handing down a lengthy suspension or even expulsion from the Commons.

Mr Cox told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ‘Anybody who has the power to expel a Member of Parliament from the House of Commons has an enormous power to alter governments, to change the shape of political history.

‘I think what the critics of the current system have to answer is if external regulation is going to be introduced, who is to do it, and to whom is that person or regulator to be accountable?’

While MPs are accountable to the electorate through the ballot box, in the case of an independent regulator ‘the only conceivable possibility would be to hand it to a court’, said Mr Cox.

‘That would involve real problems, constitutional problems, of the separation of powers. I'm not at all sure the judiciary would want to have the powers,’ he said.

And the Torridge & West Devon MP added: ‘Nowhere in the world - certainly in no major democracy - has there been complete external regulation.’
