Mauricio Pochettino has admitted he will have to wait until the last minute before knowing if Hugo Lloris will be fit to face the side that put 11 goals past him last season.

The France goalkeeper pulled out of his country’s fixture against Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem, which leaves Pochettino unsure of his fitness for Saturday’s clash at Manchester City.

Lloris returned to Tottenham on Wednesday, but will undergo assessment on Friday to see if he is fit to face a side that trounced Spurs 5-1 and 6-0 last season.

Asked if Lloris was able to play, Pochettino said: ‘Maybe, maybe, maybe. Hugo arrived on Wednesday but we need to analyse and to test and we have another day to decide.

‘All players are important. Hugo, yes, is our keeper that we use more than another but we need all players to be fit. We need to wait for tomorrow (Friday) to analyse and then decide.’

Michel Vorm would deputise in the event that Lloris is ruled out, while Nacer Chadli is also a significant doubt after missing Belgium’s clash against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday with a hip problem.

Tottenham travel to the Etihad Stadium with an unbeaten away record, while City have occasionally looked shaky at home in defence of their title.

Pochettino, who insisted he will not dwell on last season’s hammerings, said: ‘You never know if it is a good or bad time to play them. The most important thing is we arrive in a good moment. After our victory against Southampton we need to keep the momentum and reproduce the same action during the game against Southampton and try to get the three points but you never know.’

He added: ‘The reality is I don’t remember the results (from last season). It is important this is another season. This is another philosophy, another game. We need to arrive on Saturday to get the points that is the more important thing.

‘It is not important to think in the past. It is important to look forward.’
