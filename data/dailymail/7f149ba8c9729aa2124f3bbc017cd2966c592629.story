Horrified spectators watched as the 62-year-old fell to his death and landed in the back garden of home.

Tragedy in the sky: Mark Curto, 62, fell off this small plane during a wing walking stunt in Florida

Festival of Flight: The tragedy happened during an airshow held at the Tampa North Flight Center

Curto was an experienced skydiver who was taking part in the Festival of Flight event being staged at the Tampa North Flight Center, the station WTSP reported.

His death is being investigated by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Just how Curto came to fall to his death was in dispute with two versions of how he fell from the bi-plane.

Federal Aviation Officials said Cuto was carrying out a wing-walking stunt for the show.

But Chuck Norris, a flight instructor at Tampa North Flight Center, said Curto was skydiving and after he jumped his parachute failed to open.

Curto's body landed in the backyard of a house on in the Grand Oaks subdivision in Land O Lakes.

Officials said he died on scene. A woman and her children were at home when his body landed in their yard, according to officials.

‘You had children playing in their front yards. Kids could see the planes from their front yard. This is something people could see in various parts of the community,’ said Pasco Co. Sheriff's Office spokesperson Melanie Snow.

After Curto fell from the plane, the pilot circled the location and then returned to the airfield.

‘We were admiring it and my son just said, “mom, look,” and I looked up and we just saw a man just falling out of the plane,’ Atricia Smith, who lives in road where Curto fell, told the station Fox13.

‘Instantly I thought about him just being out maybe on some adventure and how shocking this is going to be to his family. One minute it was a happy moment to...what went wrong?’

Melanie Snow, a sheriff's office spokesperson, said this appears to be an accident.

‘We are calling it a fall from the plane because his parachute never even opened,’ she said. ‘But he did have a parachute on him and we believe the intent was to parachute from the plane.’

She said it appears unlikely that a medical condition, such as a heart attack, caused the victim to fall.

He landed in a homeowner's backyard on McBrine Court. Neighbors ran over to try to help, but it was too late.

It is at least the third fatal skydiving accident in the Tampa Bay area in the past three years.

In March, two skydivers from Iceland, instructor Orvar Arnarson, 41, and student, Andrimar Pordarson, 25, died in a jump March 23 at Skydive City in Zephyrhills.

In that case, for an unknown reason neither man deployed his chute, and emergency chutes deployed too close to the ground to save them.

And in 2010, Paul C. Luter III, 68, died after jumping at Skydive City when his parachute apparently malfunctioned.

In April of this year, Curto lost his wife of 36 years to breast cancer. The couple did not have children.
