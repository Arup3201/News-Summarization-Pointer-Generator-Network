Conspiracy: Nazis hid the fact Erwin Rommel, who led the Afrika Korps before trying to kill his leader Hitler, committed suicide, a police report revealed

A police report from 1960 has surfaced in Germany showing the shabby Nazi conspiracy to cover up the forced suicide of heroic ‘Desert Fox’ Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

Rommel killed himself with cyanide on October 14 1944 after he was implicated in the failed plot of July that year to kill his master Hitler with a bomb at his HQ in East Prussia. 

Thousands died in the whirlwind of revenge unleashed by the Nazi state after the botched assassination.

Rommel, the most high-profile warrior of his country, exalted by the newsreels and adored by the people, was promised that his family would be spared revenge if he took his own life. 

He was given a full state funeral in Berlin with the regime claiming he was killed by a heart attack following an Allied strafing of his car.

Now the man who falsified his death certificate, Dr Friedrich Breiderhoff, has spoken from beyond the grave of the cynical charade he was forced into to cover up his death.   

A seven-page report he made to Cologne police on July 22 1960 has now been found in the city’s archive in which he details how he was threatened with pain of death by an S.S. man to lie on Rommel’s death certificate.

Dr Breiderhoff was brought from his post at the reserve military hospital at Ulm where he was the chief physician. 

He was told to inspect a person in a car outside by two senior army officers.

He told police: 'It was Herr Rommel.  His hat and his marshall’s baton were lying to the right of his upper body on the floor. 

'Then a man in civilian dress appeared and ordered me to begin resuscitation attempts and told me that I must not tell the staff that he was dead.

'I made a direct cardiac injection and then attempts at resuscitation with heart massage and breathing exercises, as if the Field Marshall had drowned. 

'I felt completely that Rommel was a dead man already. Then an S.S. man ordered me to remove the vomit from his mouth and I found an empty cyanide capsule in his throat covered with brown and yellow mucus.

'I was then ordered that I had to put ‘heart attack’ on the death certificate on the express orders of the High Command of the Armed Forces.

Denial: Hitler held a state funeral for Rommel in Berlin, branding him The Fuhrer's General

'An S.S. man told me to maintain confidentiality otherwise I must expect revenge against my family and "other consequences." 

'He pointed to a gun laying on a table as if to emphasise the point.'

The certificate was filled in with the wording: 'Death as a result of a heart attack suffered while in service of the Reich in the west.'

Four days later the Nazis gave Rommel the hero’s send off they told the people he deserved.  He was honoured at his burial as ‘The Fuehrer’s General.’

Dr Breiderhoff’s statement was never made public until historians found the report this week.
