An injured cyclist was left lying in the road following a crash for an hour and a half today despite the nearest hospital being less than a mile away.

The woman, who is in her 60s, was left lying in the middle of Broad Street in Teddington, south west London, after being involved in a collision with a car at about 8.55am.

Police officers were first to arrive at the scene and covered her with a blanket, but paramedics didn't arrive until 10.27am because two ambulances were diverted to other incidents.

The woman, who is in her 60s, was left lying in the middle of Broad Street in Teddington, south west London, after being involved in a crash with a car at about 8.55am. Paramedics didn't arrive at the scene until 10.27am

Stephen Knight, a London Assembly Member and councillor for Teddington, posted a photograph of the scene on Twitter with the caption: 'Horrified that a cyclist was left in the middle of the road in central Teddington this morning for over an hour before the ambulance arrived.'

Another, writing under the Twitter handle of @TeddingtonTown, said: '45min after being knocked off bike, cyclist still on the road on a cold day, albeit under a blanket.'

And Geoff Lundholm also posted a picture, with the caption: 'Where is the ambulance. Over an hour this lady down no ambulance (sic).'

London Ambulance Service said it was 'very sorry' with the delay in sending an ambulance to the scene, but insisted two were diverted to more serious matters.

Teddington Memorial Hospital was less than a mile from the scene of the crash.

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 8.55am to reports of a road traffic collision on Broad St in Teddington.

'From the information provided, we were told the patient was conscious, breathing and alert.

'We sent an ambulance crew at 9.08am but they were diverted to a patient in a more serious condition.

People took to Twitter to share news of the crash which occurred at rush-hour this morning in Teddington

The crash occurred less than a mile from Teddington Memorial Hospital, which has a walk-in care centre

'A second ambulance crew was dispatched at 9.23am but they were also diverted to a patient in a more serious condition.

'A crew arrived on scene at 10.27am but we remained in contact with the patient throughout who had lower back pain but was not in a serious condition.

'She was taken to West Middlesex Hospital, but not on blue lights.

'We are very sorry we couldn't be there sooner and for any distress or discomfort this may have caused but we have to prioritise patients in a serious or life-threatening condition.'  

It comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson warned Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that the ambulance service faces a potential crisis this winter due to the soaring number of 999 calls and staff shortages.

Last month, 64 per cent of the services’ ambulances sent to serious emergencies arrived in time, which falls short of the 75 per cent target.
