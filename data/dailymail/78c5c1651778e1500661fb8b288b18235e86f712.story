The local hunter suspected of killing and eating a missing German tourist has a tattoo of a notorious cannibal tribe on his shoulder, it emerged yesterday.

Henri Haiti is on the run after the remains of Stefan Ramin were found round a campfire on the French Polynesian island of Nuku Hiva earlier last week.

A photograph of Haiti, 31, pictures him with a distinctive tattoo just below his left shoulder, which shows a warrior from the Kaioi tribe, who were said to eat their victims.

According to experts, the Kaioi tribe used to live on the same island where 40-year-old Mr Ramin's charred remains were found.

Haiti, who was a member of the island's canoe club, sports the image of a Kaioi warrior in a canoe on his upper body, according to German tattoo expert Joerg Klein.

Pacific islanders have denied the claims that Mr Ramin was eaten by cannibals after insisting: 'We prefer hot dogs to people'.

Fears that outdoor fanatic Mr Ramin had been cooked and devoured erupted after his charred remains were found on a campfire on Nuku Hiva following a goat hunt.

Although locals described their shock at the island being linked to cannibalism, a picture of Haiti revealed that he sports a tattoo of a Kaioi warrior on his left shoulder.

Cannibal expert Dr Gundolf Kruger said: 'Polynesians are now Christian and literate, therefore pious and educated. But it is entirely possible that the criminal was led by old rituals into this crime.'

Journalist Alex Du Prel on the neighbouring island of Tahiti said locals were shocked at claims Mr Ramin had been eaten.

He wrote in his Nouvelles de Tahiti newspaper: 'Trust me, we'd rather eat hot dogs than humans around here.

'These tales of flesh-craving islanders are totally invented.

'Believe me, French civilisation has taught these people to eat cheeseburgers and canned food, not people. And the wild pigs we breed here are far tastier.'

Mr Ramin had been sailing around the world with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, for three years when they stopped on Nuku Hiva on September 16.

The day he disappeared he had gone with his guide Haiti to hunt goats.

Ms Dorsch said Haiti later returned to their boat without Ramin and tied to convince her to come into the jungle, saying her boyfriend had been injured.

When she refused, she claimed he tied her to a tree and tried to sexually assault her.

She escaped and raised the alarm but Haiti had fled, police said.

The hunter is said to have 'an unrivalled knowledge' of the densely forested terrain and would 'probably find it easy' to elude his pursuers, officials said.

The 40-year-old from the small town of Haselau in north-west Germany was on a round-the-world trip with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, when they anchored off the coast of the Polynesian island on September 16.

Mr Ramin and Miss Heike began their travels in 2008 and dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva last month

He went off on a goat hunt with Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - and never returned.

It was only on Wednesday last week that the human remains were found. Among the embers were bones including a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings.

Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'.

A family friend said: 'It is a tragedy that a man with such a zest for life should have his days ended in such a brutal fashion.'

He bought his catamaran Baju in Turkey and had planned to spend the next two years island hopping in the South Pacific.

The island of Nuku Hiva has a population of around 2,000

On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'.

Last month, they dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva, largest of the Marquesas islands, which over the centuries have featured in many reports of cannibalism.

Deborah Kimitete, deputy mayor of Nuku Hiva, told local news website Les Nouvelles: 'No one can believe what has happened. This has never happened here before, this is the first time, it's horrible.'

It was not clear whether Miss Dorsch is still on the island or whether she has returned home to Germany.

Nuku Hiva has a population of just over 2,000 and featured in the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick.
