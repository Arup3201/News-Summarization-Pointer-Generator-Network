Bacon-flavoured toothpaste and bacon doughnuts are testament to how much people love the cured meat.

And now there’s a bacon-powered motorbike that belches out meaty fumes.

The motorbike will feature in a documentary called Driven by Bacon about a man embarking on a road trip across the U.S. 

He will meet other bacon-lovers on his way from Austin, Texas to San Diego, California.

Minnesota-based meat company, Hormel Foods, collaborated with a biodiesel firm to make fuel for the bike from bacon grease.

‘We actually had the grease from our Rochelle, Illinois, plant so it is all 100 percent Black Label,’ Hornal’s brand manager Nick Schweitzer told local TV station Kaal. 

The bike can travel between 75 and 100 miles (121-161km) on one gallon of bacon grease, which works out at approximately $3.50 (£2.10).

The fumes from the bike are said to smell of frying bacon, according to Modernfarmer.com.

Scott Schraufnagel, from the advertising agency behind the trip, said that because the bike runs on B-100 bio diesel, there are ‘no hazardous waste materials’.

Around one gallon of fuel is generated from one pound of bacon grease.

Demand for left-over grease from chips and meat is on the rise as more people try to make their own money-saving biofuel.

This had led to an increasingly number of grease thieves, Oilprice.com reported. 

In 2011, the U.S. National Renderers Association estimated that six million pounds of grease was stolen and was fetching between $300 and $900 per tonne.

One politicians in North Carolina proposed that it should be made a felony to steal more than $1,000 worth of grease and suggested that people should have to have a license to sell it.

The team told The Washington Times: ‘If there were a bacon biodiesel tanker spill in the ocean, the fuel would be safe and mouth-watering fish food. 

‘This bacon biodiesel is nearly carbon-neutral, meaning it contributes almost zero emissions to global warming.’

Bacon is not the only food grease being used to power vehicles. McDonalds has used chip fat to power a fleet of vehicles in the UK.

At the time of announcing its move in 2007, the fast food chain said it would save more than 1,650 tonnes of carbon every year - the equivalent of taking 2,424 family cars off the roads for 12 months.

But less appealing fats have also been used to make fuel, including surplus lipids from liposuction patients - a practice which is banned in California and elsewhere.

The bacon road trip team hopes to find people who are ‘excessively passionate’ about something - especially bacon - on their travels.

The motorbike is set to arrive in San Diego in time for the city’s annual bacon festival, where the documentary will be shown at the end of the month.

It is expected to be displayed at the Spam Museum in Minnesota later in the year.
