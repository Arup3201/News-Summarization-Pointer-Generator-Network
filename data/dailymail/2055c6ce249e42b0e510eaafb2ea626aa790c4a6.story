Warrants for three Wesleyan University students arrested after a rash of illnesses on campus linked to the party drug Molly show police believe the bad batch of the drug originated in the Washington, D.C., area.

The students, all neuroscience majors, were arraigned Wednesday in Middletown Superior Court, not far from the private college's campus.

Superior Court Judge Leo V. Diana set bond at $50,000 for Eric Lonergan, 22, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 20-year-old Rama Agha Al Nakib, a Syrian citizen. Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, was freed after posting a $5,000 bond.

Expected: Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, is also due in court Wednesday

None of the three students entered pleas and their cases were continued to March 3. The fourth student who was arrested, Andrew Olson, of Atascadero, California, posted bail Tuesday and is due in court March 3. All four have been suspended from Wesleyan.

Authorities said 11 people, including 10 Wesleyan students, some of whom had attended a rave music show Saturday night, received medical attention over the weekend.

Two remain hospitalized. One of the victims was found unresponsive with no vital signs and was revived by paramedics who used six defibrillator shocks and numerous chest compressions, according to arrest warrant affidavits released Wednesday.

Lawyers for Lonergan, Kramer and Al Nakib said Wednesday that no Molly was found in their clients' rooms on campus.

But according to the affidavits, Al Nakib told police the 'bad Molly' came from Kramer, and witnesses told them it was purchased in Washington, D.C. The affidavits also cite a text conversation that references Kramer losing his usual supplier and going back to an old source. 

Jennifer Zito, Kramer's lawyer, asked the public to reserve judgment.

'These are very, very bright students, who have bright futures ahead of them and we certainly don't want to make any judgments at this time,' she said.

Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA. It can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure.

Prosecutors said authorities found numerous prescription drugs in Lonergan's room. Police also found more than 600 Xanax capsules and $310 in cash in Al Nakib's room, and nearly 200 nitrous oxide canisters, a scale and marijuana in Kramer's room, prosecutors said.

Witnesses told police all four students sold Molly on campus, according to the affidavits. One witness told police she bought a bag of white powder from Olson on Friday and began feeling sick after consuming it.

Olson established the Wesleyan chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy in 2013 and currently is co-president. The group advocates for changes to national drug laws that it describes as counterproductive.

Authorities from various agencies were working to identify the different types of chemicals in the batch of Molly that caused the overdoses, Middletown Police Chief William McKenna said.

'This particular batch may have had a mixture of several kinds of designer drug chemicals, making the health risks unpredictable and treatment to combat the effects complex and problematic,' he said.

Lonergan is accused of possessing a controlled substance and illegally obtaining or supplying drugs, while Olson faces charges of possessing and selling a hallucinogen. Kramer is accused of possessing drug paraphernalia, a regulated substance and a small amount of marijuana. Al Nakib is accused of possessing a controlled substance, a controlled substance with intent to sell it and drug paraphernalia.

Eleven Wesleyan students, some of whom had attended a rave music show on Saturday night, received medical attention over the weekend, police said, and two students were still being treated

Dr. Mark Neavyn, chief of toxicology at Hartford Hospital, said users who believe they are taking Molly are often receiving different kinds of designer drugs, with ranges of purity and potency making the health risks unpredictable.

The weekend rash of Molly hospitalizations wasn't the first such episode this year at the private university of nearly 3,000 students.

Wesleyan health officials said in a campus-wide email on Sept. 16 that students had been hospitalized the previous two weekends after taking Molly. Students were urged to visit the university's health center if they had questions or concerns.

The police chief said the safety and welfare of community members, including those on the Wesleyan campus, were his top priority.

'Incidents jeopardizing the safety will not be tolerated,' he said, 'and those offenders will be held accountable.'
