Tourists will no longer have to hold their breath when they visit the loo at certain attractions in China as the country promises a ‘toilet revolution’ to improve standards.

Western holidaymakers are often befuddled or disgusted when they first encounter a row of squat toilets on the floor, often with little separation or privacy.

And with some facilities lacking or in awful shape, China’s tourism bosses have announced a three-year plan to install more than 33,000 sparkling new toilets at tourist sites and renovate a further 25,000 across the country.

Li Jinzao, chairman of China’s National Tourism Administration, said toilets at sites and restaurants frequented by visitors will be cleaner and will meet the country’s three-star standard.

He said the plan will see 13,000 new toilets installed in 2015.

China’s Xinhua state news agency said the move follows the government’s acknowledgement that there aren’t enough toilets in tourist areas, some are still ‘dirty and chaotic’, and better management is needed.

Increasing the number – and quality – of toilets is part of China’s ongoing efforts to grow its tourism industry and improve public infrastructure.

Traditional water closets in China are squat toilets – holes in the ground or trenches where people do their business while squat elbow-to-elbow.

People are required to bring their own toilet paper, and eye contact and conversation are best avoided.

It is a primitive concept to Westerners who sit on porcelain thrones in privacy, although ‘Western-style’ sit-down toilets are common in China's tourist hotels.
