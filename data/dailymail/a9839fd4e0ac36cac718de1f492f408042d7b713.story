Thousands of women and girls have undergone procedures for 'designer vaginas' in the past five years because internet porn is distorting perceptions of what is normal, doctors have warned.

In the past decade, cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold and more than 2,000 women are now having the procedure on the NHS each year.

Over the past five years more than 250 such procedures were performed on girls under the age of 14, NHS figures show.

But experts warned this was merely the
 'tip of the iceberg' since private cosmetic surgeons are not required 
to contribute records for official figures.

The
 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) today proposed
 restrictions on the procedures in both NHS and private clinics.

The
 most common kind of female cosmetic surgery is labiaplasty, in which 
the size of the patient's labia minora is reduced. This can be done on 
legitimate medical grounds, as a treatment for women with concerns about
 hygiene, difficulties during sex, or discomfort duing exercise.

But
 Dame Suzi Leather, chairman of the Royal College's ethics committee, 
said the recent rise in cases had been 'fuelled in part by the mass 
media and inaccurate advertising'.

'Some
 women are requesting it solely for cosmetic reasons and these decisions
 are not always being made on an informed understanding of the normal 
variations that exist, but influenced by images from popular culture and
 the pornography industry,' she said.

'We need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases.'

Thomas
 Baldwin, a philosopher who also sits on ethics committee, added: 'The 
misapprehension arises from the prominence of just one type of "neat" 
genital appearance, the type to be found prominently depicted in 
pornography.'

But 
complications from the surgery are common, with ruptures reported in a 
third of cases and NHS doctors reporting seeing women who have suffered 
complications caused by private-sector surgery.

There
 is also a lack of research into the long-term risks posed by 
labiaplasty, the report warns. Some women who have undergone the 
procedure can suffer damage to sexual function and discomfort when 
wearing tight clothes.

In the short term, risks can include bleeding and wound infection.

The
 RCOG's ethics committee warned that teenage girls could be undergoing 
unnecessary surgery that is anatomically not much different from female 
genital mutilation.

According
 to NHS figures cited by the British Society for Paediatric and 
Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), 266 girls under the age of 14 had 
genital surgery between 2008 and 2012, which was carried out 'for 
unknown reasons and with unknown consequences'.

The society warned that undergoing labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems. Â 

'The
 younger a girl begins her labiaplasty trajectory, the higher the number
 of operations over her lifetime and the greater the risk of scarring 
and sensitivity loss,' the report said.

Instead
 teenage girls should be told 'unambiguously' when they have normal 
genitals; those showing signs of psychological problems related to their
 body image should be directed to paediatric psychologists, it says.

Experts
 also said that surgery should not be conducted on the NHS unless it is a
 medical requirement and that private surgeons should give women 
information on the normal range of genital appearance.

Consultant
 plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic
 Plastic Surgeons, said he welcomed the new guidelines.

But he told the BBC that clinicians should be sensitive to potential problems.

'An
 asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic
 problems. Over 50 per cent of my patients see me due to functional 
reasons,' he said.

'Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.'

However, he did concede that he had seen the number of patients requesting the procedure soar in recent years.
