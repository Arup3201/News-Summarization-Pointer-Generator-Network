Nathaniel Clyne is discussing the possibility of making his England debut at Wembley this weekend when he appears to give the game away.

‘Growing up in an estate with lots of flats there were a lot of people around, so tickets are in demand for the game on Saturday,’ he admitted. ‘It’s a good feeling for me to be here. 

'I’m buzzing. It’s a great achievement. I’m buzzing, my family are buzzing and my friends are buzzing. I’m just looking forward to my first cap.’

At Wembley on Saturday, when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier, there is a chance he will start ahead of Arsenal defender Calum Chambers.

This has been some journey for the Southampton defender, forcing his way into the England squad after making steady progress at St Mary’s.

He is proud of his Stockwell roots, plastering his arms with reminders of London landmarks — Big Ben and a London phone box among them — plus another of him holding a football as a young boy.

‘The tattoo is of me as a baby holding a football — it’s a picture of me in my mum’s house and I thought it would be good to get it written on my arm,’ he added.

‘I was about three at the time. I always wanted to be a footballer and I followed my brother because he was always playing in the park. I’m proud of where I’m from. I grew up in Stockwell, which wasn’t bad.

‘My mum has always been there and she took to me games when I was younger. She follows my progress now. She comes to every single game, wishes me luck and gives positive feedback.

‘She was happy. She was so delighted. I think she cried when I told her I got a call-up. I am happy to do my family and friends proud. She’d be over the moon if I made my debut. She’s my No 1 fan.’

Clyne’s journey into the professional game began when he joined Tottenham, via the Afewee Academy in Brixton, at the age of 11, but the long journeys across town on school nights became too much.

‘The Afewee Academy gave young kids the chance to play football and show what they could do,’ added Clyne. ‘They explained to me that I was really good, better than the other kids, and that’s when I realised I could be a professional.

‘I loved playing football so always went there after school. I just loved playing so didn’t really think much of it until the coach, Steadman Scott, got me a trial at Tottenham. In the end it just got too much travelling to Essex after school each day.’

Clyne can make his England debut under manager Roy Hodgson at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday

Clyne moved to Crystal Palace, his local team, and made rapid progress through the youth ranks before making his debut for the club under Neil Warnock in his first spell at Selhurst Park.

His progress was smooth, and he made a name for himself there before his move to Southampton in 2012, when they were promoted to the Barclays Premier League.

Last month he forced his way into Roy Hodgson’s squad for the first time. Here at St George’s Park he is competing with Chambers, the man who traded positions with him last year at Southampton under Mauricio Pochettino, to start against Slovenia.

Clyne was picked for the last squad, taken along for the ride for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and the trip to Estonia.

He has displaced Liverpool defender Glen Johnson and is regarded by Hodgson as a player with immense potential.

He added: ‘I was disappointed not to play last month, obviously. As Calum was called up from the Under 21s most people would have expected me to play, as I was always in the senior squad. 

'But I can’t let that affect me. I’ve just got to concentrate on the next games and try to get into the team. The manager hasn’t explained anything to me at all.

‘The manager obviously thinks highly of me and I’m being credited for my performances from Southampton. If you play well you get called up. I’m not that surprised I’ve kept Glen Johnson out of the squad. I feel like I’m playing really well, and if I get a chance to play I’ll try and prove it.’

After three impressive years at Southampton, he has certainly earned it.
