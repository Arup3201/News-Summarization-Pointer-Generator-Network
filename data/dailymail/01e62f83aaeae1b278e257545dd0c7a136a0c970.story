When the Higgs Boson particle was discovered, the fact that CERN had decided to use the Comic Sans font to make the announcement threatened to overshadow the whole historic occasion.

The same things nearly happened today following the landing on Mars by Nasa's Curiosity rover - with Nasa lead Bobak Ferdowsi becoming an internet sensation as viewers grew captivated by his red-tinged mohawk haircut, the the yellow stars dyed above his ears, and his big beaming smile following a successful day.

Within minutes, satirical posters went up online, his name began trending on Twitter, and tributes and even artwork flooded in to celebrate his new instant celebrity.

 the evening tweeting back to his new followers, before finally 
relaxing, signing off with: 'Internet, you win this round. I'll be back

...But naturally, Bobak was concentrating more on his work - the culmination of years of intellect and mechanics to send Curiosity to another world

The Nasa team spent the last few 
years working to a tight deadline during a round of budget cuts in a bid
 to get the Curiosity on to Mars, culminating in the 'seven minutes of 
terror' as the Curiosity headed through the atmosphere to the surface.

Once it landed, the Nasa team could afford to relax a little.

But now the work is back on - for the
 rover is starting to beam high-definition footage back to Earth, while 
scanning under the surface of the Red Planet in a bid to find evidence 
of microscopic life.
