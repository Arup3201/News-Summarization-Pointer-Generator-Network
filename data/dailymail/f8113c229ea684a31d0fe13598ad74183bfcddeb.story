A New Jersey substitute teacher is facing trial after allegedly sexually assaulting several of her students and sending explicit text messages to others.

Linda Hardan, 21, who works at Manchester Regional High School in Passaic County, took a 16-year-old student to a location in Wayne  and sexually abused him, prosecutors claim.

She also reportedly sexually assaulted an eight-grade student at Haledon Public School - where she also works - as well as sending explicit texts to both him and a separate 16-year-old.

She is now facing multiple counts of sexual assault, assault and endangering the welfare of a child.

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges and remains in Passaic County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail. She could face more than two decades in prison if convicted, according to NJ.com.

Ms Hardan, from Prospect Park, was first arrested on November 21 after the unidentified teenager she reportedly assaulted in Wayne a day earlier complained to the police.

During a subsequent investigation, she was found to have allegedly assaulted the 14-year-old boy in early November, as well as sending sexually explicit texts to him and the other Manchester student.

The exact details of the messages she reportedly sent have not been revealed.

At an arraignment hearing on Tuesday morning, Judge Adam Jacobs reportedly ordered Hardan to undergo a psychological evaluation before a bail reduction hearing, scheduled for Friday.

But the suspect's defense attorney, Aymen Aboushi, said the evaluation was 'precautionary' and his client is not a danger to herself and others, the New Jersey Record reported.

Hardan - who is a graduate of Manchester Regional High herself - apparently teaches at both schools on only an 'as-needed' basis.
