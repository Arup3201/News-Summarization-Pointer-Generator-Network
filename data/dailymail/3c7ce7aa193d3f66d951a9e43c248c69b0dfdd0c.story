The Florida mother of a woman who went missing after appearing on the show The People's Court in 2011 has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's former fiance.

Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando, vanished on November 17, 2011, the same day the episode of The People's Court featuring her case aired on television.

Parker and her ex-fiance, Dale Smith, who is the father of her twins, came on the show to resolve a dispute over a lost $5,000 engagement ring.  

New evidence: Michelle Parker disappeared two years ago after appearing on The People's Court with her ex-finance Dale Smith, new police have revealed they have new video evidence

Crusading mother: Michelle Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, filed a wrongful death lawsuit claiming that Smith is to blame for the disappearance of the woman, who is now presumed dead 

The mother of three was last seen dropping off her three-year-old twins at Smith's home.

Police named Smith as the prime suspect in her disappearance, but he has never been arrested or charged in the case.

The lawsuit filed by Parker's mother,
 Yvonne Stewart,  seeks damages totaling over $15,000, alleging that 
Smith was 'negligent or otherwise committed a wrongful act and caused 
the death' of the woman.

Her body has never been found, but 
the lawsuit claims that the 33-year-old 'died on or about November 17, 
2011 as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the 
defendant.'

'[Yvonne Stewart] doesn't want to 
believe it happened, but everyone knows what happened and when it 
happened,' Parker estate attorney John Morgan said to ABCNews.com. 'We 
think she was killed.'

The lawyer claims he is in poseesion 
of text messages between Parker and Smith, as well as other evidence 
that he would no further elaborate on, saying that he does not want 
Smith to be 'ready for that.'

'We'll be most interested when we get a chance to depose him,' Morgan said. 'Will he take the fifth or tell the truth?'

Smith's attorney, Mark Nejame, 
insists that Morgan and Parker's family have nothing to connect his 
client to the woman's disappearance.

Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired two years ago and on the same day Parker disappeared

'They're barking up the wrong tree,' 
Nejame said. 'They've been frustrated for a long time because law 
enforcement hasn't found a scintilla of evidence that ties him to her 
disappearance or murder...Just because everyone thinks he did it doesn't
 mean he did it.'

The lawyer said that Smith 
voluntarily spoke to police on four separate occasions and submitted to a
 full home insepction just hours after his ex-fiancee was reported 
missing.

'Our hearts go out to Michelle 
Parker's family, truly, but sadly a lawsuit against Dale Smith is not 
going to bring them any closer to finding out what happened to Michelle 
Parker,' he said.

The attorney described his client as a
 good father to his four-year-old wins. Parker's 10-year-old son lives 
with his father in Pennsylvania.

The grandparents have a written 
agreement with Smith for the custofy of the children, but Stewart has 
been pushing for clearer rights established and legal right to poetition
 the court for visitation.

Stewart launched a campaign and 
petition that grants visitation rights to grandparents when a child's 
parent goes missing or is murdered.

The bill is backed by Florida House 
Representative Darryl Rouson and it is expected to come into legislature
 this session, Morgan said.

'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends

Stewart's missing daughter had a very stormy relationship with Smith. She was last seen dropping off the twins at Smith's house.

Police conducted an night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid.

Miss Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com:

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.'

Miss Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.'

She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.'

Miss Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence.

It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery.

On the TV show Miss Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost.

Miss Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there.

Miss Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother ... that's why we're crying every day.'
