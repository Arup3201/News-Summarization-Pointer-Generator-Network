An 11-year-old boy who took a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun to his school, along with 400 rounds of ammunition, said he heard voices telling him to shoot another student for calling his friend ‘gay’.

The voices told him to then turn the gun on himself, police said.

The student faces charges of attempted
assault and other crimes after bringing the gun, along with kitchen 
knives, to Frontier Middle School in Vancouver, Washington.

Alarming: The 11-year-old boy took a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun to his school

Kim Kapp, a Vancouver Police 
Department spokeswoman, said: ‘He told officers he had heard a voice in 
his head telling him to shoot another student. Fortunately, everything 
was found very early into this situation.’

The school, about 20 miles from 
Portland, Oregon, was put on lockdown for roughly two hours and there 
were no injuries, Kapp said.

Police arrested the boy on Wednesday 
and booked him for attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm 
and possession of a weapon at school, according to the arresting 
officer's declaration of probable cause.

Lockdown: The school and adjacent Pioneer Elementary School were put into lockdown Wednesday at about 9:20 a.m. for two hours

Detained: No-one was injured and the student was taken to the Clark County Juvenile Detention Center

Frontier Middle School is about 20 miles from Portland, Oregon

The boy appeared in juvenile court on 
Thursday morning, and the attempted murder charge was dropped. He is 
being held in a juvenile detention facility.

He told police the voices told him to 
shoot another student in the arm for calling one of his friends ‘gay’ 
and then shoot himself in the head, according to court documents.

An estimated 900 students attend the middle school.

Panic: The Facebook page for Evergreen Public Schools was flooded with comments from parents after this message was posted on Facebook

'We got a message on the intercom that
said we were in lock down. We were under the table for about an hour 
and then we could move around,' said Zaniah Matthews, a sixth-grader at 
Frontier Middle School told KPTV.

Parents were primarily alerted about 
the incident through the Frontier and district Facebook pages, along 
with the district website, said Kris Fay, spokesman for Evergreen Public
Schools reported The Colombian.

Some parents heard about it through local news outlets or text messages from their children.

The Facebook page for Evergreen Public
Schools was flooded with comments from parents after a message was 
posted on the page reading: 'Frontier Middle School was placed in 
lockdown earlier this morning after weapons were found in a student's 
backpack. Police are on the scene and students are safe in their 
classrooms.'

Some of the parents were concerned that they were not notified of the lockdown.

Brenda Lehto Hudson wrote: 'I really 
hope Evergreen uses this as a huge learning experience and changes the 
way they notifiy parents in an emergency such as this. Yes, I want all 
resources directed at keeping my children safe but if someone can take 
the time to post on facebook, they should be able to initiate the flash 
alert system. Not everyone has access to facebook, this was very poor 
communication.'

But Cindy Miller wrote: 'Give the 
district Slack they are doing their best to keep our children safe! It 
isn't their fault there are crazy people out there! I think the school 
does their best!'

The boy’s arrest came after a string 
of violent incidents in U.S. schools, including two this week, which 
have reignited a national debate over gun control.

A 14-year-old boy pleaded not guilty 
on Wednesday to killing a math teacher, whose body was discovered in the
woods behind his high school in the Boston area.

And, on Monday, a student armed with a
semi-automatic handgun killed a math teacher and wounded two classmates
before killing himself at his Nevada middle school.

In February, two fifth-grade boys were
arrested after bringing a knife and gun to school in an alleged 
murder-rape plot that also targeted other children in eastern Washington
state.
