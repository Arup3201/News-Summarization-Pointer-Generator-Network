Veteran TV and radio presenter Stuart Hall was arrested today after he was accused of rape.

The former It’s A Knockout host and BBC Radio 5 Live commentator, 82, was seized during a dawn swoop on his £1.5million detached home.

He was then taken to a police station where he was questioned over accusations of historic rape and indecent assault. Lancashire Police say the arrest is not connected the Operation Yewtree investigation into alleged child sex offences.

It's a Knockout presenter Stuart Hall, pictured receiving his MBE in October last year, has been arrested on suspicion of sex offence allegations in a dawn raid on his home this morning

Last night he was still in custody at a police station as officers close to the investigation refused to elaborate on when the alleged offences happened or whether they involved a minor.

The arrest was carried out by officers from Lancashire Police at his family home in a quiet leafy area in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where he lives with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, 74.

The couple, who have two grown-up children, Daniel and Francesca, are popular among their local community where they carry out a lot of charity work.

Yesterday forensic officers were searching their five-bedroom house on the edge of the upmarket town – which also boasts Sir Alex Ferguson as a resident.

Neighbours were not answering their 
doors yesterday but a builder working on a nearby property said: ‘We saw
two police cars in his driveway at 8am but had no inkling as to what 
was going on.

‘We didn’t see him come out of the 
house or anything. The next thing we knew the police cars had gone. It’s
incredible to think they had come to arrest Stuart Hall.’

As well as hosting BBC regional news programmes, Hall was the original host of BBCs A Question Of Sport, which started in 1968.

He won legions of fans in the 1970s 
and 1980s for his inimitable style and habit of breaking down in fits of
infectious laughter during It’s A Knockout – which saw teams from 
around Britain compete in a series of madcap games, often involving 
giant foam costumes and custard pies.

Hall also became a regular football 
match day reporter for BBC Radio 5 Live, noted for his idiosyncratic 
football reports – often quoting lines of Shakespeare and poetry.

A lifelong Manchester City fan, Hall 
claims to have coined the term ‘the beautiful game’ for his description 
of the skills of one prolific goalscorer.

Less than a year ago, Hall was awarded an OBE for services to broadcasting and charity in the Queen’s New Year Honours list.

At the time of getting the award he said: ‘I’m overjoyed. It’s a great surprise, totally unexpected. I’m grateful.

‘I’ve always regarded myself as a 
second-rate provincial hack. Well, that was yesterday. Now I’ve got the 
OBE, I’m still a provincial second-rate hack, but I’m a good one.

‘It’s a recognition that you’ve put 
something in. I’ve worked for charity now for the last 52 years, I’ve 
raised millions of pounds and it’s a little thank you. I feel, in my 
82nd year, a little glow of pleasure.’

Lancashire Police yesterday refused 
to confirm or deny the identity of the suspect but said in a statement: 
‘An 82-year-old man from Wilmslow in Cheshire has been arrested by 
Lancashire Police at his home address on suspicion of rape and indecent 
assault.’

A spokesman added: ‘The allegations of rape and indecent assault are historic and a full investigation is under way by officers.

‘We take all allegations of sexual 
abuse extremely seriously. We would encourage people with any 
information about sexual abuse or who has been a victim of sexual abuse 
to come forward and report their concerns confident in the knowledge it 
will be investigated appropriately and with sensitivity.’

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'It's not part of Operation Yewtree.'

Five arrests had been made as part of
a seperate national investigation, called Operation Yewtree, into 
alleged sexual offences by Savile and others.

A suspect, in his 80s and from Berkshire, was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences last week.

Gary
Glitter and comedian Freddie Starr were arrested and bailed under 
Operation Yewtree in the strand classed 'Savile and others'.

DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s were arrested and bailed in November as part of the operation strand classed as 'others'.

Scotland Yard is leading the inquiry and has said officers are currently dealing with around 450 potential victims.
