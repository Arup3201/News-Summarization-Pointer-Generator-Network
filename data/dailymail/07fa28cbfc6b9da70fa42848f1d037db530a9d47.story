If you want to keep that New Year's cheer tonight, wrap up warm - because 2014 is expected to start with freezing temperatures and a generous dusting of snow.

Revelers watching the ball drop in New York City will see just a sprinkling of snow as a blizzard moves north before blanketing Chicago with as many as ten inches throughout the night.

Party-goers celebrating the start of the year at the city's Navy Pier midnight fireworks can expect to see a significant snow storm, WLF meteorologist Mike Caplan warned.

'We're forecasting 6 inch snowfall totals 
widespread across the area and, in some cases, it will be 10 inch or more 
from the looks of it,' he said.

The Weather Channel said temperatures in Chicago should reach around 15 degrees, while New York City is expected to endure temperatures around 23 degrees and clear skies.

'Temperatures across the central U.S. will continue to be 10-30 degrees below normal as an arctic airmass remains in place,' the National Weather Service said. 'Gusty winds in this region will contribute to extremely cold wind chills.'

One of the coldest celebrations could be in Plymouth, Wisconsin, where the city will drop a large ball of cheese to mark the start of 2014, and where temperatures are expected to hit 0 degrees.

But in other parts of the country, celebrations will be graced with balmier temperatures.

The warmest welcome for 2014 may take place in Key West, Florida, where party-goers watching a six-foot conch shell being dropped, can expect temperatures of 72 degrees.

Over on the other coast, revelers in Los Angeles can expect temperatures of 48 degrees.

But
 the rest of the country should brace itself for two weather systems 
which are expected to merge and bring a major snowstorm as early as 
Thursday.

According to AccuWeather
 Canada Weather Expert Brett Anderson, 'Some all-time record lows could 
be challenged in parts of southern Quebec, northern New England and 
northern upstate New York, when the core of the cold air settles in 
Wednesday night.'

Highs in Chicago will only just reach the teens.

The National Weather Service says 
there will be bitter cold across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, 
as well as light to moderate snow.

The Gulf Coast can expect cold and wet weather, spreading eastward.

High
 temperatures for the northeastern half of the Dakotas into Minnesota 
will remain in the single digits or below zero - which is a good 20 to 
30 degrees below averagefor this time of year.

Across the southern United States it will be cold and wet with light rain on Tuesday night and heavier falls Wednesday.

Prediction: Two storms will converge on the Northeast on Thursday with the potential for a major snowstorm. How quickly they get together and strengthen will determine which areas are hit with very heavy snow and which areas will have a more manageable snowfall

The storm could have a major negative impact on travel for people returning from holiday destinations, heading back to school or resuming business activities
