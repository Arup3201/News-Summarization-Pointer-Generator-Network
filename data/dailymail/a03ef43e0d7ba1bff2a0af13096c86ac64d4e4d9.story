When you're next filling out your personal details on a form, spare a thought for this woman.

With 35 letters and 19 syllables, Janice
Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele's name was so long, Hawaiian authorities couldn't print the whole thing on her driving licence or ID card.

Instead, the 54-year-old had to have a 34-character, shortened version of her name - Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunael - on the documentation and her first name removed entirely.

Long: Janice Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele's name is so long, government computer systems couldn't process it and she had to use a shortened version on ID

But battling for over 20 years, the woman will now be allowed both her first and surnames on her driving licence and ID card.

Ms Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele -
whose maiden name was Worth - had the shortened version of her name as Hawaii government computer systems only allowed 34 characters.

The woman, who sometimes goes by the name  "Lokelani", said she began a campaign to have her full name printed after she was stopped in her car by police.

She told BBC World: 'The
policeman looked at my licence and saw I had no first name.

'I told him 
it is not my fault that my licence and state ID are not correct and I am
trying to get it corrected.

'He then told me "Well, you can always change your name back to your maiden name."

'This hurt my heart.'

Ms Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele 
said that the officer's attitude upset her because he was being 
'disrespectful of the Hawaiian people'

She said: 'Over the last 22 years I have seen... the culture of Hawaii being trampled upon and this policeman treated my name as if it was mumbo-jumbo.'

Victory: After 21 years, the 54-year-old will have her 35-letter surname on her licence as well as her first name

After she brought her concerns to the 
governor's department, they announced that a licence and an ID card 
which allows her full name on it will be produced by the end of 2013.

A
spokeswoman for Hawaii's transport department, Caroline Sluyter, said 
computer systems across the state were being upgraded to accommodate 
longer names.

She said: 
'We have been made aware of that issue, and I know right now they are 
working to extend that limit to - I believe - 40 characters so that 
issue can be resolved'

Marriage: Janice 'Lokelani' took the name of her late husband, pictured, in 1992

Ms Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele -
who got her name after marrying in 1992 - said that her name had many 
layers of meanings including 'one who would stand up and get people to 
focus in one direction when there was chaos and confusion, and help them
emerge from disorder'.

She said it can also mean 'When there is chaos and confusion, you are one that will stand up and get people to focus in one direction and come out of the chaos.'

The woman said her husband, who died in 2008, had similar issues with documentation.

She said: 'He always had problems with trying to get people to use his whole name.

'They would chop it up into smaller pieces.'
