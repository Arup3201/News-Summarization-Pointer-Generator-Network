This is the moment a hapless motorist was found desperately clinging to his car aerial after he careered through a fence and plunged into a 12ft deep garden pond.

The non swimmer was at the centre of a rescue operation after he was spotted waist deep in the murky water with his hands wrapped around the mast.

The Vauxhall Corsa ended up nearly fully submerged in the pond after the driver slewed off the road, when he collided with a parked car to avoid a deer.

This is the moment the hapless motorist was found clinging to his car aerial after plunging into a garden pond

Police, fire fighters and paramedics were dispatched to bizarre scene in Rumburgh, Suffolk, after the alarm was raised at around 3am.

Fire crews used an extendable ladder to rescue the man from the roof of his car before the damaged Corsa was hauled out of the water.

 'I didn't hear much as I was fast asleep, but then there were three fire engines, the ambulance and the police outside my house,' said Roger Davis, 59, whose pond was at the centre of the rescue.

'The chap was clinging to the roof of the car, they got him off and pulled the car out. He couldn't swim - and the pond is about 12 foot deep at the moment.

'I think the chap went to hospital with hypothermia, he was clinging to the roof and holding on to the car's aerial. It was interesting to say the least.

'I think he'd swerved to avoid a deer, that's what the police said.'

 The man was breathalyzed by police at the scene, but he gave a negative test for alcohol.

Stuart Hostler, watch commander at Halesworth fire station, said: 'He was a very lucky chap.

'When we got there he had already got out of the car and was holding on to the aerial for dear life.

'He was showing signs that he was very cold and he was up to his waist in the water.'

The East of England Ambulance Service said the man was conscious and alert when they arrived.
