Kenneth Bolton, 44, stole £750 he raised for a hospice that provides care for sick babies avoided jail following a trial at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court

A former professional footballer who stole £750 he raised for a hospice that provides care to babies with life-threatening conditions has avoided jail. 

Kenneth Bolton, who played for Middlesbrough FC at youth level, was the manager of Golden Flatt's Under 11s football team in Hartlepool when he asked players' parents and supporters to sponsor him for a charity coast to coast bike ride.

Bolton, 44, said he was going to carry out the challenge for Zoe's Place, a hospice for sick babies in Hartlepool that relies on public donations to perform its work.    

Hartlepool Magistrates' Court heard he printed out unauthorised sponsorship forms and collected £752 in sponsorship.

But the father-of-two was caught out when football club officials notified police of another matter - that they had given money to Bolton to buy football kits for the children which had not materialised.

They uncovered his fraudulent behaviour and Bolton pleaded guilty to theft on August 30 last year. 

Chairman of the magistrates' bench Barbara Sutherland sentenced Bolton to eight weeks in custody suspended for 12 months, ordered him to carry out 160 hours of unpaid work and to pay £752 compensation to Zoe's Place. 

The court was told Bolton, a physio, began stealing money when his family fell on hard times which saw their income halved. 

Blair Martin, for the prosecution, said: 'Zoe's Place had no knowledge of the defendant and had not given him any sponsor forms.

'He said he had recovered the sponsorship money, which he was going to give to charity but fell on hard times financially and spent it.'

In mitigation, Bolton's solicitor Stuart Haywood, said he was 'appalled, ashamed, and remorseful' for his actions.

He said: 'You have to ask yourself why a man who has no previous convictions other than one when he was in the Army in 1997, would stoop to such depths. 

'Mr Bolton was a man who was previously on the books at Middlesbrough Football Club and when he was released by them he immediately joined the Army and was successful at football during his time in the Army and as a semi-professional player locally.

'Unfortunately the semi-professional football club he was a physio for could no longer keep him so he was released, so that was an income of about £150 to £200 per week gone overnight, and in his own physiotherapy business he was given two weeks' notice from his landlord so that ended too.

'His wife was on long term sick also. So as a family they went from having about £3,000 per month to that being halved.'

Mr Haywood added: 'He will be outcast and alienated from a community that he was probably well thought of and loved for his achievements.'

The court was read a statement from Zoe's Place which said: 'We rely solely on donations from the general public, and incidents like this raise doubts with them.

'All the money we raise goes to the babies we support.

'Incidents like this could be to the detriment of the charity.' 

Zoe's Place, which opened in 2004, provides end-of-life care to babies and infants aged from birth to five years old suffering from life-threatening conditions.  

A statement from the football club officials said they 'deplored' this act which saw Bolton 'con parents and children out of their money' which was for charity.
