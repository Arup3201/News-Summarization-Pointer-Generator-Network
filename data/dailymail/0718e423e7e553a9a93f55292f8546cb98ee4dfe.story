A judge in Chile is seeking the extradition of a former U.S. military officer for involvement in the disappearance and murder of two Americans during the coup that brought the dictator General Pinochet to power.

Charles Horman, a freelance journalist, and student Frank Teruggi went missing during the struggle and allegations of U.S. complicity in their death inspired an Oscar-winning movie.

Judge Jorge Zepeda has now asked Chile's Supreme Court to demand the extradition of Captain Ray E. Davis, who was commander of the U.S. military mission in Chile at the time, to be tried for the 1973 killings.

Retired Chilean army 
Brigadier Pedro Espinoza Bravo was also being charged for the murders.

Davis was the commander of the U.S. military mission at the time of the coup that toppled socialist President Salvador Allende, working as a liaison between the U.S. and Chilean militaries.

His current whereabouts were not immediately clear. Espinoza is jailed in a special Chilean prison for offenders convicted of human rights abuses.

Mr Horman's widow Joyce told Associated Press: 'I'm stunned. I'm so glad for this step forward.'

The U.S. Embassy in Chile released a statement saying that as a matter of policy the State Department does not comment on specific extradition matters.

It read: 'The U.S. government 
continues to support a thorough investigation into the Horman and 
Teruggi deaths in order to bring those responsible to justice.'

The
search for Charles Horman, who disappeared two weeks after the coup, by
his wife and his father, Ed Horman, was the topic of the 1982 movie 
Missing, which starred Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon. The film won a best
screenplay Oscar.

The film suggested American complicity in Horman's death and drew vigorous objections from U.S. State Department officials at the time.

The case remained almost ignored in Chile until 2000, when Joyce Horman went to Chile and filed a lawsuit against Pinochet.

She said she was acting on behalf of all victims of Chile's dictatorship. A national commission has determined that 3,095 people were killed or disappeared.

Mrs Horman, who lives in New York, said: 'We always thought that Chile's military would look to an American official before they killed an American.'

According to court papers, Mr Horman, a freelance journalist and filmmaker, was arrested on September 17, 1973, shortly after the coup.

He was believed to have been taken to Santiago's main soccer stadium, which had been turned into a detention camp for Pinochet's suspected opponents. He was 31 years old at the time.

A national truth commission said Mr Horman was executed the next day while in the custody of state security agents.

It also said Mr Teruggi, a 24-year-old university student, was executed several days later, on September 22.

In the indictment, Judge Zepeda alleged that the killings of Mr Horman and Mr Teruggi occurred during a secret investigation by U.S. officials into the activity of Americans at home and in Chile, 'activity that U.S. agents considered ''subversive'''.

The judge said the American journalist was considered a subversive for his work as a screenwriter for the Chilean state film company during Allende's government.

The judge alleged that Captain Davis could have stopped Horman's execution but didn't because he considered his work 'subversive and extremist'.

He also said that said the journalist may have also been killed because he inadvertently found out about U.S. 'collaboration during the military events unfolding' in Chile's military coup.

A previously classified State Department memorandum from 1976, released in 1999, stated: 'U.S. Intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death.

'At best, it was limited to providing or confirming information that helped motivate his murder by the GOC (Government of Chile).

'At worst, U.S. Intelligence was aware the GOC saw Horman in a rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage the logical outcome of GOC paranoia.'

Peter Kornbluh, who heads the Chile documentation project at the Washington-based National Security Archive, said: 'After 38 years of waiting at least the wheels of justice are turning in Chile; the legacy of U.S. involvement is obviously a factor in this case.'

Both Teruggi and Horman were monitored by U.S. agents in Chile, Judge Zepeda said, adding that the information gathered was passed on to Chilean intelligence officials who ordered the men's detentions.

The whereabouts of former Captain Davis, who would now be in his mid-80s, were unclear.

But in a February 13, 2000, article, The New York Times quoted him as saying that he had nothing to do with the deaths.

He said Teruggi and Horman were 'down there handing out pamphlets against the government'.
