He had a hand in some of the ‘most heinous and brutal crimes in human history’ during an 11-year war in Africa.

And yesterday Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, received his punishment as he was jailed for the rest of his life by a war crimes judge.

He is likely to serve his sentence in Britain following a pledge by the Labour government in 2006.

Jailed: Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor looks downbeat as his sentence is read out today

Killer: Charles Taylor, pictured here in his heyday, was told his crimes were of the 'utmost gravity'

Richard Lussick, the judge at the 
UN-backed court in The Hague, said Taylor was in a ‘class of his own’ 
when it came to war crimes and sentenced him to 50 years.

Taylor, 64, had provided arms and 
support to the brutal Revolutionary United Front rebels in neighbouring 
Sierra Leone – in return for a steady supply of ‘blood diamonds’.

‘While Mr Taylor never set foot in 
Sierra Leone, his heavy footprint is there,’ the judge said. The rebels’
atrocities included cutting off the limbs of their victims and cutting 
open pregnant women to settle bets on the sex of their unborn children, 
he said.

Taylor immediately lodged an appeal which means he will remain in the Netherlands for now.

It will cost at least £100,000 a year 
to keep him in jail here. Labour boasted that its 2006 offer of a cell 
was proof of a commitment to international justice.

During Taylor’s trial, model Naomi 
Campbell’s evidence provided a key link between Taylor and the diamonds 
he received in return for arms.

First: Charles Taylor is the first former head of state convicted by a war crimes court since WWII

Warlord: As president of Liberia from 1997-2003,
Taylor was accused of war crimes including the employment of child 
soldiers, rape and murder in the brutal war against neighbouring Sierra 
Leone

Taylor is the first former head of 
state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II 
and judges said they had no precedent when deciding his sentence.

He looks likely to serve his sentence 
in a British jail after Tony Blair's government in 2006 made the offer 
to resolve a stand-off that had delayed Taylor's two-year trial.

He said: 'The special status of Mr 
Taylor as a head of state puts him in a different category of offenders 
for the purpose of sentencing.'

At a sentencing hearing earlier this 
month, Taylor expressed 'deepest sympathy' for the suffering of victims 
of atrocities in Sierra Leone.

But he insisted he had acted to help 
stabilise the West Africa region and claimed he never knowingly assisted
in the commission of crimes.

He said: 'What I did...was done with 
honour. I was convinced that unless there was peace in Sierra Leone, 
Liberia would not be able to move forward.'

However, judges ruled that Taylor 
armed and supplied the rebels in full knowledge they would likely use 
weapons to commit terrible crimes.

This was in exchange for payments of 'blood diamonds' often obtained by slave labour.

Prosecutors said there was no reason 
for leniency, given the extreme nature of the crimes, Taylor's 'greed' 
and misuse of his position of power.

Prosecutor Brenda Hollis wrote in a 
brief: 'The purposely cruel and savage crimes committed included public 
executions and amputations of civilians.

'The display of decapitated heads at 
checkpoints, the killing and public disembowelment of a civilian whose 
intestines were then stretched across the road to make a check point.

'Public rapes of women and girls, and people burned alive in their homes.'

Taylor stepped down and fled into 
exile in Nigeria after being indicted by the court in 2003. He was 
finally arrested and sent to the Netherlands in 2006.

While the Sierra Leone court is based 
in that country's capital, Freetown, Taylor's trial is being staged in 
Leidschendam, a suburb of The Hague, for fear holding it in West Africa 
could destabilise the region.

One of Taylor's sons is in jail for 
torture, another is awaiting trial for murder and two more children were
fathered while he was in Dutch custody.

More than 120,000 people were killed 
and two million displaced in Sierra Leone’s civil war which was 
characterised by atrocities, the use of enslaved child soldiers and the 
amputation of children’s limbs as a weapon of terror.

Claims: Naomi Campbell (right) allegedly accepted a 'blood diamond' from the former 
African despot. She said she was given it by unknown men. Mia Farrow 
(centre) contradicted this, as did Campbell's former agent Carole White (left) who said Campbell knew Taylor sent two men 
to her room to give her the precious stones

Britain played a vital role in ending 
the war after Tony Blair sent in 800 troops in May 2000 to evacuate 
foreign nationals and support Sierra Leone’s fledgling democracy.

The UK troops also assisted in 
capturing rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, and helped to form a military 
strategy which forced the Revolutionary United Front to retreat from the
capital, Freetown, a former Crown colony.

Pivotal to the case was the evidence 
of supermodel Naomi Campbell and actress Mia Farrow, who provided a 
clear link between Taylor and blood diamonds he received in payment for 
arms.

London-born Miss Campbell admitted being given a pouch of uncut gems by the president’s men after a dinner in South Africa.

Taylor is thought to have acquired from the rebels diamonds worth as much as £950million.
