A church vicar has been arrested on suspicion of raping a teenage girl.

Anglican priest Rev Simon Marsh, 54, was questionedÂ  by detectives investigating allegations of sexual abuse between 2011 and last year.

The Rev Marsh is vicar of Bramhall in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and is based at St Michael and All Angels Church of England Church.

Church leaders at the Diocese of Chester expressed 'shock and surprise' at his arrest, which happened on Thursday.

They confirmed he will stand aside from all parish duties while the investigation continues.

No criminal charges have been brought and Rev Marsh was later released on police bail after questioning.

Parishioners at the church, on St Michael's Road, are due to be informed of the news at services tomorrow and a senior priest is expected to stand in over the period of the enquiry.

Police said an investigation is underway into alleged offences of sexual assault involving a girl between 2011 and 2013. She was aged between 16 and 19 at the time.

In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said investigations were continuing.

A spokesman said: 'Police are investigating a report of historic sexual abuse in Bramhall. The offences occurred between 2011 and 2013 when the woman was aged between 16 and 19-years-old.

'A 54-year-old man from Bramhall has been arrested on suspicion of rape. He has now been bailed pending further enquiries. Enquiries are ongoing.'

Church authorities said they were 'shocked' by the allegations but vowed to assist police with their investigation into Rev Marsh who was parish priest at St Michael's Church of England Church in Bramhall, Stockport (pictured)

Rev Marsh has served as a parish priest in five separate parishes.

Writing on his personal blog which is linked to the church's website, he said he has previously served as Vicar of Bollington in Cheshire and Vicar of St Paul's in Macclesfield.

He became the sixth vicar of Bramhall in May 2006.

Rev Marsh wrote that he served in the early 1980s as a domestic chaplain to the Bishop of Bradford and before that was Assistant Curate of Mottram in Longdendale.

He is married to wife Jilly and is said to enjoy canal boating and canoeing.

It is understood that the alleged victim gave a statement to specially-trained police officers earlier this week.

The Diocese confirmed the arrest. A spokesman said: 'We are shocked and surprised at the arrest of the Vicar of Bramhall and the allegations he faces.

'We will co-operate fully with police enquiries. Simon Marsh will be suspended from his parish duties. A senior priest will be asked to stand in and provide pastoral and church services support.'
