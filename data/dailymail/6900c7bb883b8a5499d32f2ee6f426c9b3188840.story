And to think this wasn’t deemed attractive enough for television?

What more do they want? League One versus Premier League, old boys with scores to settle, a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at.

And boy did it deliver, Phil Parkinson’s Bradford City – heroic conquerors of Premier League leaders Chelsea in the last round – booking their place in the quarter-final for the first time in 39 years.

That's it from today's game between Bradford and Sunderland. You can follow our live commentary of Arsenal's match against Middlesbrough by clicking HERE.

League One side Bradford have progressed to the sixth round of the FA Cup, while Sunderland failed to turn up.

They were left stunned in the first three minutes when John O'Shea put through his own net and former Black Cats forward Jon Stead ensured his side progressed to the next round by scoring past Vito Mannone. 

Stead receives a tremendous reception from the home fans as he makes his way off the pitch. Another fine performance by the former Premier League star.

It seems a bit too late but Poyet has decided to throw on U21 star Honeyman and Vergini with just four minutes left on the clock.

Sunderland have 10 minutes to get themselves back in the match. Wickham, Fletcher and Johnson have failed to deliver so far. Can they change the outcome of the match? Time is ticking.

Phil Parkinson brings on Halliday, who scored in Bradford's win at Chelsea.

Wickham's goalbound shot has just been blocked by his team-mate. It really hasn't been Sunderland's day.

Bradford fans are now singing 'You're getting sacked in the morning' towards Poyet. It's not going to be that bad for the Uruguayan but it is a big opportunity missed if they fail to at least earn a replay - which is looking incredibly unlikely. 

Mannone is flapping at everything. Will Poyet's decision to rest Pantilimon may come back to haunt him! Just under 20 minutes left to play.

What was Adam Johnson doing? A player of his calibre should not be trying to play the ball across goal. That's something you learn as a schoolboy. 67 minutes gone and Sunderland are showing signs of frustration. Jones has just been booked.

Bradford's Stead punishes his former side for two horrific errors. Firstly Adam Johnson tries to pass the ball across his box and then Stead's feeble shot somehow manages to find a way past Mannone. Poor goalkeeping by the Italian.

The Black Cats are starting to control possession. Alvarez seems to be seeing a lot of the ball but he has been unable to pick out Wickham and Fletcher thus far. 

Jermain Defoe has been left out of today's squad due to a slight groin injury. Poyet would probably love to be able to call on the striker!

As predicted Wickham has replaced Graham in attack. Poyet will be hoping the 21-year-old can pose more of a threat in attack.

Just to recap, League One side Bradford go into the interval with a 1-0 lead thanks to an own goal by John O'Shea after just three minutes.

The Bantams' goal was fortunate but fully deserved as they have been the better team. 

Adam Johnson has just sent a free-kick over the bar. The Sunderland winger has been unable to get on the ball and really run at Bradford's defence. Poyet is going to have to make a change at the interval - whether it is to the personnel or his side's shape.

There has been a lot of talk about Van Gaal's use of long balls during the last few weeks but it is working wonders for Bradford. Their wide players are firing crosses into the middle of the penalty area, which Sunderland are struggling to cope with. Just under two minutes until the interval.

Bradford goalkeeper Williams has finally been tested. Van Aaholt's shot was deflected but the home side are able to clear. Poyet does not look happy on the sidelines as his side remain 1-0 down.

Larsson has been booked for a late challenge. 38 minutes gone and Bradford continue to dictate play. 

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet will be already weighing up his options to make a possible change at half-time. His forward players have failed to take the game to Bradford. Wickham could be an option.

Here's Sunderland's bench: Pantilimon, Wickham, Jordi Gomez, Coates, Vergini, Honeyman, Agnew

I think Sunderland's defence are going to struggle to contain former Sunderland striker Jon Stead today. He's winning everything in the air ahead of Brown and O'Shea.

Bradford look extremely comfortable so far. 24 minutes gone and Sunderland have hardly tested Bantams goalkeeper Williams. The likes of Johnson and Fletcher have failed to show their class.

Six yards out with whole goal to aim at, how long did Steven Fletcher want?! Brilliant challenge from Rory McArdle. Fletcher should be ashamed claiming for a penalty.

Sunderland are finding it hard to get used to the pitch. Jones just stopped to stare at the turf after failing to get the ball under control. Bradford will say the conditions are the same for both sides.

Sunderland striker Fletcher has just had a golden opportunity to level the scoreline. He had an incredible amount of time to pick his spot but was tackled as he was about to pull the trigger. Fletcher wanted a penalty but the referee waved play on. The score remains 1-0 to Bradford after 19 minutes. 

This has been a frenetic start - the early goal, two head injuries and Gus Poyet losing his rag with referee Kevin Friend (twice). But Sunderland's lacklustre start can be summed up by Ricky Alvarez appearing to be scared of the ball as it dropped from the sky, ducking out of a free header! I don't think this is his sort of contest...

I was just about to say Bradford's pitch is in a terrible condition before O'Shea put through his own net. Could that work in the League One side's favour?

Clarke celebrated Bradford's opener as he took the original shot however it will go down as an own goal as the ball was going wide before O'Shea's deflection.

Clarke's shot was going wide until O'Shea stuck out his leg to divert the ball into his own net. The Bantams probably cannot believe their luck but the scoreline is all what matters.

Bradford have taken the lead after just three minutes. Clarke took a shot at goal from inside the penalty area which was deflected in off Sunderland defender O'Shea. 

Bradford XI: Williams, Darby, McArdle, Davies, Meredith, Liddle, Morais, Knott, Clarke, Hanson, Stead

Sunderland XI:  Mannone, Jones, van Aanholt, Brown, O’Shea, Bridcutt, Larsson, Johnson, Alvarez, Fletcher, Graham
