A council has ordered a couple to rip up flowers outside their home over health and safety fears.

Mary and William Geidt planted the roses, irises and other flowers ten years ago to brighten up a patch of grass outside their home.

The couple, who live in the village of Great Cransley, Northamptonshire, claim a highways officer advised them to plant shrubs and flowers to reduce further damage to their property following two devastating floods.

'Petty': Mr and Mrs Geidt say they planted the flowers to brighten up the verge

Over the past decade the beauty of the flower bed has become renowned in the area with people stopping to take pictures of the displays.

But Mrs Geidt, 62, and Mr Geidt, 69, were stunned when they received a letter from Northamptonshire County Council ordering them to dig up the flowers or face legal action.

The couple believe it was reported after a council officer went to a neighbouring property in connection with a planning application and noticed the flower bed.

Council bosses claim the flowers obstruct pedestrians view of the kerb which could cause them to stumble into the road.

But Mr and Mrs Geidt say they have not received a single complaint in a decade and only receive compliments that the flowers brighten up the quiet road.

Mrs Gedit, who is a full-time carer for her 91-year-old mother Margaret, said: 'It does not make any sense, because there is a perfectly good footpath on the opposite side of the road.

'It seems petty and heavy handed and we feel like we're being singled out.'

Mrs Geidt said she wanted to come to a compromise.

'Our cottage is set below the road, so our ground floor windows are at the same level as the road.

'The verge is steeply sloped. The lane is not cleared of snow or gritted and there were two minor accidents last winter.

'From our own experience we know it is difficult to see the edge of the road in snow and there is a real possibility of a serious accident if drivers skid down the bank into our cottage.

'The flower bed helps to make it very obvious were the edge of the road is.' she continued, 'We spend hours tending to the border and planting it each year, we spend money on buying the plants as well.

'It is tragic to think we might have to pull it all up, we are willing to compromise but a sensible compromise.'

In a letter to the couple last month, the council said: 'It is occasionally possible to grant a licence to cultivate the public highway

'It is unlikely a licence would be granted for the shrubs in situ, as some species are not encouraged because of their growth nature and form.'

Mr Geidt, who runs his own utilities consultancy, added; 'The border is very narrow, probably only 18 inches and there is footpath just the other side of the road where there is street lighting.

'There are only a few houses and a footpath at the end of the cul-de-sac so there usually more walkers along here than cars.

'To me, this decision is quite literally blooming petty. There is no other way to describe it.'

The council stood by their ruling.

A spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council said: 'Regrettably, highways law, which the county council has to comply with, is very strict when it comes to safety regulations regarding roads.

'In this instance the flower beds and shrubs interfere with visibility and so we have asked for the vegetation to be removed.'

Upset: The couple say they have spent time and money making the verge look pretty and want to come to a compromise with the council

'Interfere with visibility': The council says it wants the vegetation to be removed

Sloped: Mr and Mrs Geidt say the verge is sloped and they say the flowers make it obvious where the edge of the road is

Letter: Council bosses wrote to the couple telling them they had 14 days to pull up their flowers
