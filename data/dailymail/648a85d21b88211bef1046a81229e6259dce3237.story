A New Zealand radio DJ gave a Paralympic swimming champion an unsightly surprise when he accidentally sent her a photograph of his 'pork sausage' while she ate an evening meal.

Dom Harvey aplogised to Sophie Pascoe via Twitter after she opened photo-sharing website Snapchat during supper to be confronted by the intimate portrait of his private parts on her screen.

Pascoe, who won a glut of golds in London 2012 and is currently competing in Canada at the IPC swimming championships, tweeted: 'Just finished eating dinner and opened Snapchat. #awkwardsurprise.'

Harvey, who is well-known for his outrageous antics on morning radio show 'The Edge', then tried to make light of the gaffe by referring to her role as an ambassador for New Zealand's beef and lamb industry.

'So sorry about that Snapchat,' he wrote. 'I know you like beef and lamb ... but nobody deserves a surprise pork sausage.'

He later revealed that the image was in fact meant for his radio producer Sophie Hallwright and had simply mailed the obscene image to the wrong Sophie, the New Zealand Herald reported.

Champion: Sophie Pascoe won six medals, including three golds, during the London Paralympic Games in 2012

Sophie Pascoe told New Zealand's Herald on Sunday that she did not want to talk about the photo.

Harvey's employer, Mediaworks, condemned the incident, but will not reprimand the DJ for the gaffe.

Programme director Leon Wratt said: 'It was a stupid thing to do.

'No one feels stupider than Dom himself but he has apologised. No disciplinary action is planned.'

It's not the first time Harvey has landed himself in hot water with controversial statements online.

He has slammed female rappers, mocked a famous television couple for wife swapping and likened an X Factor contestant to child molestation.
