The National Security Agency said late on Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours and not hackers, contrary to some online claims.

The NSA website was down for several hours after 3pm on Friday prompting claims that the site of the secretive surveillance agency had been targeted by rogue hackers.

But the agency denied it had come under attack and said in an email to ABC News that an 'internal error' had been responsible for its offline presence.

The National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. The NSA's website went offline for at least six hours on Friday but the agency denied this was because of a hacker attack

'NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,' the spy agency said in a statement.

'The issue will be resolved this evening. Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.'

The site was inaccessible for at least six hours on Friday and even longer for some users.

German officials have traveled to Washington to investigate claims that the NSA bugged the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel is among the world leaders who are trying to cope following allegations of massive electronic monitoring by the NSA around the world

Some Twitter accounts affiliated with infamous internet hacker group Anonymous claimed credit for a denial of service attack while other hackers also claimed responsibility for sending the website offline.

The NSA has come under fire recently in the aftermath of revelations about deep domestic and international spying programs.

The range of surveillance by the NSA included allegations the agency bugged the telephones of foreign government leaders, including political allies such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

German intelligence officials are headed to Washington to confront the U.S. over the claims Chancellor Merkel's phone has been bugged since 2002.

German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle told a press conference on Thursday that the revealtions had jeopardized relations with the U.S. and damaged trust between the two supposed allies.

'If you trust one another, you don't spy on each other,'Westerwelle said. 'Doing so regardless puts pressure on the friendship.'

Demonstrators marched through Washington, DC, on Saturday towards the National Mall for a rally to demand that Congress investigate the National Security Agency's mass surveillance programs

The DC protests came in the same week as allegations the NSA bugged the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel

Many of the claims about the range of NSA activity came from files taken by former contractor Edward Snowden who provided details of the agency's programs to selected media.

Thousands of people protested in Washington, DC, on Saturday against the NSA's domestic and international surveillance programs by marching to the Capitol.

Protetsors holding signs that said Stop mass surveillance,' 'Thank you, Edward Snowden' and 'No NSA mass spying,' called for closer scrutiny of the agency.
