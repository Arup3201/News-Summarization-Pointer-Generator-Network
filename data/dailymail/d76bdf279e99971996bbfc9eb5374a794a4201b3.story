Who's there? The tribe numbers about 200 and is left alone to live in peace by the Brazilian Government

Threatened: The elusive tribe's dwellings are at risk from cattle ranching and logging, among other things, though, and its land is monitored by officials to prevent encroachment

Busy: According to a charity, this particular tribe grows crops, peanuts, bananas and corn

Remote: The tribe is pictured surrounded by banana plants near their straw roof huts

The tribe, which numbers about 200, lives in Acre State. The Government follows a policy of not contacting them but monitors their land as it is threatened by logging, mining, cattle ranching, fishing and hunting.

Leaders of the Ashaninka tribe, which shares territory with this tribe and other uncontacted ones in the Amazon, have asked the government and NGOs for help in controlling the encroachment of these tribes in their own area, according to Reuters.

According to Survival International, an organisation working for tribal people's rights worldwide, this particular uncontacted Amazonian tribe grows crops, peanuts, bananas, corns and more.

The pictures also show banana plants near the tribe's straw-roofed huts.
