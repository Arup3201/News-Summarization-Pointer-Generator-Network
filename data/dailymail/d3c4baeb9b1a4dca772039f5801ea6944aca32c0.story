Simple blood thinning drugs such as aspirin could be used to prevent repeated miscarriages, new research has revealed.

Doctors have discovered blood thinning treatment can fix a faulty gene found in a high number of those who suffer from repeated miscarriages.

A recent study showed it was present in 44 per cent of IVF patients, compared to only 15 per cent of the general population.

Aspirin could be the key to treating the genetic problem and helping prevent repeated miscarriages

The blood thinning treatment now being used to fix the gene is said to be so effective it gives those carrying it an 'equal playing field with anyone else trying to conceive'.

And those treated with the drugs, at IVF treatment provider Care Facility, were found to have a healthy baby birth rate of 38 per cent.

Professor 
Simon Fishel, Care Facility managing director, said the study was remarkable for a number of reasons.

'It's blood thinning treatment - it's a drug called heparin - possibly even aspirin, but we're studying that at the moment.

'Those 
women who have had very poor prognosis . . . Can now have the chance of a
 live birth similar to people who don't have this problem.'

The gene variant, called C4/M2, creates difficulties for the embryo implanting in the womb. And remarkably, it can be passed on through both men or women.

'We studied
 our IVF patients and found that 44 per cent of couples carried the 
gene,' Prof Fishel said. 'This is the first time in the world where it has been found that a
 man can carry a gene that can pass on miscarriage to a woman.'

Passed on through the male or female, the gene was responsible for repeated miscarriages as it caused blood clotting problems
