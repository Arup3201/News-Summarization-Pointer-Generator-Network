Barack Obama securing a second term as president of the United States is the end of the world. At the very least, America is dead.

Or that's what you'd assume scrolling through this Tumblr blog dedicated to chronicling the misery of Mitt Romney supporters in the aftermath of the election.

It may be schadenfreude but there is plenty to enjoy on the undiplomatically named blog - White People Mourning Romney - which gathers together Facebook posts, tweets, pictures and news clippings.

White people mourning Romney: The lady on the left looks disgruntled with proceedings while this girl's (right) hopes and dreams were crushed as Mitt didn't make it

Closed (for one day): This shop was shut by its owner in order to mourn the loss of America as it should be - but don't worry, it will be open again tomorrow

Half mast: To mark a dark day for Republicans this family lowered their flag

No stars in her eyes: This Romney fan appears distraught and dazed, gazing into the middle distance

Many on the web certainly think so and it has since gone viral, being shared at volume via emails and on Twitter.

The blog title itself has stoked up controversy for various reasons. One being that millions of Caucasians supported Obama and wanted nothing to do with Romney.

'I'm white and I voted for Obama. How am I supposed to feel about threads like this?' one girl complained on an online message board discussing the blog. 

And no doubt the Republicans also had some backing from Americans from ethnic backgrounds too.

Superhero salute: Even Captain America can't raise a smile from this lady upset about the result

Misery guts: This woman looks decidedly sulky while another girl (right) weeps into an American flag

Better luck next time: These right-wingers were hoping to see Romney replace Obama at the helm of America

Cry baby: A picture posted on Facebook of a grandmother holding her grandson along with her promise to continue to fight for him because his liberty and freedom is in jeopardy

But it's difficult to get away from the fact that a large percentage of Romney's supporters are indeed Caucasian.

The Washington Post report that President Obama captured 93 per cent of the African-American vote and 71 per cent of the Latino vote in this election.

See you in 2016: A sad photo of a Romney supporter carrying off a cardboard cut-out

When republican Artur Davis spoke at the Republican National Convention in the summer 98 per cent of the delegates were white.

He noted on Thursday that 'The Republican conservative base seems perilously close to shrinking to white southern evangelicals, senior white males and upper income Protestants.'

Disaster strikes: Living in the land of the free has never felt so bad for these Romney fans

Cause for concern: Has the past four years really been so bad that it makes a mother cry at the prospect of four more?

Glum grans? These older ladies don't look happy with the result of the US Election - but the one on the left is certainly dressed to impress

I can't believe America: This cutting from the official student newspaper of the University of South Carolina, The Daily Gamecock, shows a 'devastated' Mormon

So play along with the stereotypes and it's difficult not to laugh at people overreacting to the election result.

One shop owner shut his store, placing a banner in the window stating it was 'to mourn the loss of the America that our forefathers endowed to us'.

However just underneath was a smaller notice, saying that the shop was only shut 'for one day'.

This sums up the blog in a microcosm - the people pictured seem to be so distraught about proceedings you would be forgiven for thinking they were undergoing some terrible, irreversible trauma.

Once beautiful: This girl tweeted she was going to dress in funeral colours because of the election result

With that attitude you'd probably have dropped out anyway: This girl posted on Facebook to say she has no promise of a future

One evil world: This girl was upset that Romney could not be president because the world was too evil to allow it

Just wait until Obama screws us over: This girl tweeted that she wanted to move to Australia to live under a Christian president who 'actually supports what he says'

Reading and seeing some of the 
responses seems to suggest people don't realise Obama has already been in 
office four four years already.

A post on another board read: 'The sad part is that there are kids crying. It will be hard to wake them up from the charade with parents like these (that goes for both sides).'

Coroner's report: The Cincinnati Tea Party deduced that the United States had killed itself

But what chance do kids and their parents have when people in the public eye react so dramatically to these things?

Devout Christian and one-time Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson is a stout Republican supporter. 

When she discovered the election results she had a Twitter meltdown.

She blasted American Christians, saying: 'Thanks a lot Christians, for not showing up. You disgust me.'

Magic moment: These Republicans react to a bad result coming in with cries of disbelief and anguish

Drastic measures: One girl on Facebook advocated secession for parts of America

'The Democrat Party voted God out and replaced Him with Romans 1. In the good vs. Evil battle... today... Evil won.'

Earlier she wrote in three successive tweets: 'I can't stop crying.'

'America died.'

'I can't stop crying. America died.'

Later she was back at it, asking: 'Why can't we have 2 countries? America Red and America Blue - only Blue people aren't allowed to ask us for money when free phones run out.'

Jackson eventually said she was going to take a break, but not before getting one final dig at the president in: 'The power of the tweet is going to my head, i better take a break... or I might get as arrogant as Dictator Obama.' 

Now even Romney fans have to crack a smile at that. Then again, maybe not.

Wackier than Michael? Charlotte Jackson took to Twitter to showcase a flood of emotion, all of it negative

Secret democrat? The girl on the right does not seem as upset as her friends about the election result

Oh, for the days that were: A man looks forlornly at his American flag as the results come in

Boo for blue: This girl is not too happy about having to pin Democrat blue on the US map
