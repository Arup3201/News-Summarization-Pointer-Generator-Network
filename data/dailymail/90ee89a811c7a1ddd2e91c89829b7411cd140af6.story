 An American doctor battling the Ebola virus has said he is "terrified" and "praying fervently to God" that he will survive the fatal disease.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, who traveled to West Africa with the Christian aid group Samaritan's Purse, was the first American infected with the killer disease.

After identifying the condition he isolated himself in a ward at the treatment center in Liberia. He is now being treated at a hospital in
 Monrovia, Liberia's capital where earlier today it emerged he has made a
 ‘slight improvement’ over the past 24 hours.

Hero: Last week Dr Brantly was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects. But that did not stop the good doctor from treating his sick patients

In an email sent to his former work colleague in Texas, Dr Brantly asked people to also pray for Nancy Writebol, a missionary who was the second American infected with the disease.

'I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease," Dr Brantly said in the email to Dr David McRay, the director of maternal-child health at John Peter Smith Hospital in Texas, where Dr Brantly worked for four years.

Dr McRay said Dr Brantly was "terrified" of the disease progressing further and that he wanted people to remember that hundreds of people are suffering with the disease, and that he is no different than any of them.

In the email seen by MailOnline Dr Brantly wrote:

“David, I think what I would like to say is thank you for all the prayers and messages of encouragement. I am praying fervently that God would help me survive this disease. Please continue to pray along with me, and pray for my friend Nancy, who is also very sick, and for the doctors who are taking care of us. Thank you all so much. Peace, Kent”

This comes as Dr Brantly’s wife thanked 
the public for prayers and said their family’s faith sustains them 
during this tough time.

Helping hands: Generally patients who enter the second stage of the Ebola virus do not survive.They die an agonizing death

Incredible man: Close friend KellumTate posted several photos of the hero medic saving lives in Africa on her Facebook page.

In a statement posted to the Samaritan’s Purse website, Amber said Kent remains ‘physically weak’, but Kent ‘his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal.’

‘We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support,’ she said.

She added that her family ‘appreciate so much all the words of comfort and acts of kindness.’

'As people with a deep faith in Jesus, we sincerely thank the thousands of people worldwide who have lifted up Kent and this dreadful situation in prayer,' she wrote.

'We continue to lean on that faith and take great consolation in our God in these times.'

Amber is in the US with her children and asked for prayers and privacy. She said she and her family 'continue to believe that God will deliver Kent from this deadly virus.'

A close friend of Dr Brantly's, nurse Kellum Tate, posted several photos of the hero medic saving lives in Africa on her Facebook page.

She wrote next to the photos that she had spent five weeks working with him in Tanzania in 2012 and paid tribute to an 'incredible man', 'whose compassion, endurance, and love for mankind are humbling to an unfathomable degree.'

The nurse wrote: 'I thought a few pictures of this wonderful man doing the things he loves most - being with his family and working tirelessly to treat patients - would be appropriate. 'If you're a praying person, pray for him. If you're not a praying person, pray for him anyways.'

Dr Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol are now entering a ‘critical’ phase of their treatment, the head of the charity which sent them to Liberia has revealed.

Keeping the faith: In a statement posted to the Samaritan's Purse website, wife Amber said Kent remains 'physically weak', but 'his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal'

Bruce Johnson, President of SIM USA, told MailOnline that within the next few days we will know if Kent Brantly is likely to survive.

He said that Ebola could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal.

Dr Johnson also warned that unless the international community does more to stop what has become the most serious outbreak of Ebola in history then it will spark a ‘tsunami of destruction’ in Africa - and maybe beyond.

Last week Dr Brantly was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects.

Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second.

The condition update will be agonizing for both their families - not least Dr Brantly’s wife Amber who is in the US with their two young children.

Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were in Liberia with SIM USA and Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid charity.

Dr Brantly was treating the sick whilst Mrs Writebol was disinfecting medics as they left isolation wards.

Words of gratitude: Dr. Brantly wrote in a new email: 'Please continue to pray along with me, and pray for my friend Nancy, who is also very sick, and for the doctors who are taking care of us. Thank you all so much. Peace, Kent'

Mr Johnson told MailOnline that both were being treated in isolation private houses at the SIM compound near the Liberian capital Monrovia.

Mrs Writebol was still in her home and her husband David has had to move out.

Mr Johnson said he spoke to Dr Brantly on Monday and that he ‘wasn’t as good as he had been’.He said: ‘The situation is so fluid. One day it’s up, one day it’s down. He was up working on his computer, talking with people this is not a bed ridden situation.

‘He is moving, he is active. He is interactive and we are pleased with that’.

Mrs Writebol is suffering from diarrhea but is talking and in touch with family via her computer on Skype and via email.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Her husband David seems strong. He is handling this with faith but he is also realistic with Nancy and Kent.

‘This is not a light situation. This is a very serious situation but we are encouraged by how they are doing so far.

‘The next few days are critical in assessing the recovery of both of them’.

SIM spokesman Palmer Holt said that the coming days are so important because symptoms would start to show that would indicate that the disease had entered its second, more serious phase.

The first stage is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea.

The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body.

Prayers: Dr Brantly asked people to  pray for Nancy Writebol, here with her husband David. She is a missionary who was the second American infected with the disease

Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death.

Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive.

Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control.

He said: ‘Our hearts just break for them’.

So far more than 600 people have been killed in the outbreak across West Africa that has infected more than 1,200.

Liberia has closed its borders to help stop the disease amid fears that it could spread after a patient suffering from Ebola took a flight to Lagos in Nigeria.

Mr Johnson said: ‘What we have here really is the potential for this to become a tsunami of destruction for the country of Liberia and that why we are calling on the international community to now respond.

‘It’s grown to such proportions that it’s overwhelming Samaritan's Purse and SIM and it needs others like the US to help.

‘It’s like a wildfire in the Western US. It’s like what happens to a small fire that continues to grow and no-one is trying to put it out.

‘This is preventable but right now SIM is the only care center for Ebola patients in Liberia and that has to change’.

Today the CDC issued an alert warning to travelers to avoid hospitals with Ebola patients and funerals for those patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak.

The United States is considering raising the alert to discourage "nonessential" travel to those three countries, a U.S. government spokesman said.
