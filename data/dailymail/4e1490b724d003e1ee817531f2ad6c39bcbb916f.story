A new mother 'blinded by love' was recruited to act as a getaway driver for her boyfriend in 30 burglaries just weeks after giving birth, a court heard today.

James Parker, 24, and girlfriend, Charlotte Hall, 21, carried out a month-long crime spree during which they targeted dozens of homes in Lincoln over Christmas.

The thieving couple snatched presents and
jewellery valued at over £15,000.

Hall, who had no previous convictions, embarked on their first burglary just a month after giving birth to a boy, the couple's first child.

But she was spared jail after a judge described her as a 'stupid girl' who was blinded by love and fell for a criminal.

Sentencing Hall to a 12-month suspended prison term, Judge Sean Morris admitted: 'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.'

Jailing Parker for two years and four months, Judge Morris told him it was an aggravating factor that he had recruited his partner and the mother of their newborn child.

Lincoln Crown Court heard the couple were responsible for nearly 30 burglaries and attempted break-ins carried out over the Christmas period in 2012.

Among the items stolen by the pair were a 100-year-old family bracelet and a set of £1,200 pearls bought as a Christmas present.

Other property taken by the couple, who even raided one house on Boxing Day, included a lap-top computer containing sensitive personal information and a watch given to a victim by his mother.

The court was told Hall drove Parker 15 miles in her Fiat Punto car to Lincoln where most of the burglaries occurred while the owners were out.

Much of the stolen property was recovered when police raided the couple's home in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, two days after Christmas.

In total police estimated the couple made over £15,000 from their criminal activity. Their victims included an elderly couple in poor health who were away visiting relatives for Christmas and a woman who now felt unsafe in her home of over four decades.

The court heard Parker had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty and was jailed for four years in 2009.

'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.'

Sunil Khanna, mitigating for Hall, said she was just 20-years-old when she met Parker. 'She chose to ignore things that were said about him,' Mr Khanna told the court.

'She got pregnant, they got a property together but unfortunately he was made redundant from his job cleaning farm machinery on October 24. Their son was born on October 31.'

Hall tried to resist when Parker turned back to crime, Mr Khanna added. 'In her words he wore her down and he persuaded her if she remained in the car and did not go in to the property or on to the land then she had done nothing wrong. She accepts she was naive.'

Following her arrest Hall co-operated fully with police. In total she admitted five charges of burglary in December last year and asked for 21 other offences to be taken in to consideration. Parker pleaded guilty to the same five break-ins and asked for a further 23 offences to be taken in to consideration.

Mark Watson, mitigating for Parker, said he accepted being the 'driving force' behind the break-ins.

Sentencing Hall to 12 months behind bars suspended for 18 months, Judge Morris told her: 'You richly deserve to go to prison. If there is one thing a burglar needs it is somebody to drive him and look perfectly innocent. That is you.'

But Judge Morris added: 'It is clear to me you are a stupid girl who fell for a man who got you into crime. I don't mean to be impolite, love blinds may be a better way of putting it.'

Hall was also made the subject of a six month nightly curfew and placed under the supervision of a probation officer for 18 months.

Jailing Parker for 28 months, Judge Morris added: 'This was a campaign of burglary during the Christmas period when there was rich pickings to be had in peoples' homes. It was the season of goodwill to all, you broke some hearts.'

Speaking after the hearing DC Glen Wright, from Lincolnshire Police, said: 'As the judge said this was a campaign of burglary over the Christmas period. I think he was right in that Parker was the driving force as Hall was a young lady with no previous convictions.'

One of the burglary victims said: 'As a result of these two I now feel vulnerable in the home I have lived in for 40 years.'
