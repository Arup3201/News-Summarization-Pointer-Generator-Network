Get the look: LEFT: Nylon trousers, £16, camel crombie coat, £39, white shirt £14. RIGHT: Faux fur coat, £39, funnel neck jumper, £16

Faux fur is making a comeback on the High Street and F&F meet the demand with a number of faux coats for £39 in black and animal print. They also have a vintage-inspired camel crombie coat for £39.

The theme of the collection is 'urban retro' focusing on bold primary colours and winter wardrobe essentials. 

In the past, some money savvy shoppers may not have cared to admit they purchased clothes from a supermarket. 

Bold colours: LEFT: Flame duffle coat, £39, mustard knit jumper, £16. RIGHT: Mustard short dress £20

So F&F have pulled out all the stops to showcase the range as glamorous and stylish with a slick advert shot by Adam Mufti, who has previously worked with designers such as Alexander McQueen.

An F&F spokesman said the director was inspired by the music videos of his favourite pop stars including Usher when creating the ad.

The advert begins with the camera racing towards a model strutting down a catwalk in a red duffle coat and mustard jumper before shots of other models follow in quick succession.

Pretty prints: LEFT: Faux fur coat, £39, Sixties collar spotty dress, £20. RIGHT: Floral print dress and faux fur stole, both £20 

Office wear: Sheer jumper and checked trousers, both £18 

The background remains dark making the colourful pieces in the collection - including a floral dress for £20 and a mustard shirt dress for £20 - truly stand out. 

A pop video feel is further created with the tune Sing That Song by Tieks featuring Celeste providing the soundtrack. 

The final shot pans out and raises the lights to show the models in a huge outdoor space. 

The collection is in stores now and available online at www.clothingattesco.com
