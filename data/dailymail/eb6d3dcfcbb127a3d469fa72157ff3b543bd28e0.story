Arsenal legend Robert Pires has tipped Thierry Henry and Carlo Ancelotti as potential future Arsenal managers when Arsene Wenger eventually moves on. 

Pires does not think Wenger should leave the Emirates Stadium any time soon, but feels that either his former team-mate or the Real Madrid boss should be among the candidates to replace him when he does. 

The 41-year-old, who played for Arsenal between 2000 and 2006, told Goal.com, 'Who is the perfect replacement? Thierry Henry? He understands football and Arsenal. I don't know, but I like Carlo Ancelotti. But that's my opinion, it doesn't mean Arsenal need Ancelotti at this time.'

Wenger has been criticised in recent years for failing to adequately strengthen his squad, but is expected to be more active during this transfer window, with Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista thought to be close to joining The Gunners.  

And Pires has backed his old manager's ability to sign top players.

'I wouldn't say Arsenal have made any mistakes in the transfer market. If you play for Arsenal, it means you have some quality,' he said.

'To me, Arsenal's best signing is Santi Carzola. Fans love Alexis Sanchez, and so do I; he's quick to adapt to the Premier League - but Cazorla is so important. For the last few months, he's been our best player.'

When asked if fellow Frenchman Alexandre Lacazette, who has scored 24 goals in 28 appearances for Lyon this season, could join Arsenal, Pires said: 'Why not? His characteristics and style of play will suit Arsenal.'

Pires is currently playing his football with Indian Super League side FC Goa.
