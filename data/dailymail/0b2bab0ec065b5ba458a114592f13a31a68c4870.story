It is always good form to wear a sunhat at the beach - but at one sandy spot today hard hats were more in order.

In Eastbourne, Sussex, today hundreds of tons of gravel were sprayed from just off-shore by a giant dredger drafted in to repair the devastation caused by the huge storms this winter.

Miles and miles of English coast was battered by high winds and powerful waves, which has sped up the rate at which the beach is dwindling. The process of longshore drift - where natural tides gradually shift sand and sediment along the shoreline - was put into overdrive by the unnaturally fierce weather.

In an attempt to restore the shrinking sands, the Envrionment Agency and local councils have begun using the dredging vessels - such as the Sospan Dau pictured below - to suck up sediment from one point along the beach, mix it with water and spit it back out. The process, known as rainbowing, should help protect the beach in years to come.

Gravel: The dredger sprayed a mixture of sediment and water, as workmen looked on, in a bid to repair the damage caused this winter

Spray: The dredger could be seen in Eastbourne, Sussex, today topping up the sediment by the beach

Operation: Local authorities and the Environment Agency have deployed the dredgers along the English coast

Decline: The dredger has been brought in to counter longshore drift, which gradually moves sediment away from Eastbourne's beach

'Rainbowing': The ship sucks up sediment further along the shore then spits it out at the necessary point

Imperative: The work was necessary after the impact of this winter's storms, which moved more sediment than usual from the beach

Top-up: The process should secure the integrity of the beaches for the time being
