Jailed: Nathan Rawling, 36, subjected the infant to a violent assault, causing numerous fractures and bruises

A 36-year-old electrician was today jailed for 10 years after battering a 31-day-old baby boy so badly that his heart stopped - which led to a vigilante mob storming the attacker’s home.

The tiny baby nearly died after suffering 26 fractured ribs, two broken collarbones, a broken arm and two punctured lungs in what was called a ‘frenzied, brutal and repeated assault’ by Nathan Rawling, of Gravesend, Kent.

During the December 2011 attack, Rawling also inflicted a shocking injury to the boy’s genitalia, Maidstone Crown Court heard.

After the attack police had to stop a 100-strong mob trying to storm the home of Rawling, who denied assaulting the baby, but was found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial.

Doctors resuscitated the baby at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, after Rawling brought him in ‘at the point of death’ after trying to ‘cause really serious harm’, prosecutors said.

‘The baby had collapsed and received urgent life-saving treatment,’ prosecutor John O’Higgins said. ‘There was both cardiac and pulmonary arrest - no heartbeat and no breathing.’

He added: ‘There was cardiac massage for 10 minutes before the heartbeat returned.’

The court heard Rawling, an ex-Kent County Council electrician, was arrested by police and initially admitted causing the injuries, but claimed it was a ‘misguided’ attempt to save the baby’s life.

He told police he had tried to perform CPR on the baby after noticing he had turned blue and stopped breathing.

Rawling claimed the broken arm was caused when he grabbed the baby to restart CPR and the injury to the boy’s genitals was caused when he knelt on them.

He also claimed the baby’s ribs were broken because he probably pushed down too hard on them when giving the CPR.

But later Rawling changed his defence after accepting medical evidence that the baby’s injuries could not have been caused by resuscitation.

He said the only possible explanation was that the injuries must have been inflicted by the baby’s mother.

Rawling told the jury: ‘I am still at a loss to know how he ended up in the state he did. I have found it very hard to come to terms with everything that happened. I have struggled with it.

‘I have found it very hard that anyone could do it. I still don’t quite understand.’

But Mr O’Higgins said Rawling fully intended to cause serious injury to the baby.

Referring to the boy’s genital injuries, he said: ‘We suggest the baby weed over him and that he caused that terrible injury to his penis as a result.

‘It may be he did try to save the baby and perform CPR, but if so it was because only moments before he had almost killed (the child).’

Following, the sentencing, Kent Police’s senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Pritchard, said: ‘This was an extremely serious assault on an innocent baby boy.

‘In my service I have not seen such extensive injuries on such a young child. It was a case that shocked the public and caused considerable community tension in Gravesend.

‘The infant, who was just 31 days old, suffered incredible trauma, which arguably should have cost him his life or at the very least left him with long-term medical problems.

‘However, thanks to the excellent work of the doctors and nurses at Darent Valley Hospital and Kings College Hospital, he not only survived the attack but is now doing well.

‘Rawling is a bully who took out his anger in the most cowardly way possible when he assaulted this baby and it is satisfying to see that justice has been served.’

After the attack police had to restrain a vigilante mob who tried to storm Rawling’s home. Stones and other missiles were thrown at the house, causing damage to the front door and windows.

It happened when a number of people held a candlelit vigil outside the house, praying for the injured baby who they feared might die.

Some of the mob targeted another house in the neighbourhood where they believed Rawling was staying. The violence and tension led to a local police chief making a public appeal for calm.
