Cristiano Ronaldo's love of himself was the main reason behind Portugal's World Cup failure, according to former AC Milan midfielder Zvonimir Boban.

The 29-year-old, who was announced as the world's best player earlier this year, failed to inspire his country to glory in Brazil as they crashed out at the group stage behind Germany and the USA.

But his form for his club helped Real Madrid to a 10th Champions League win, despite a poor showing from their Portuguese talisman at the final in Lisbon against Atletico Madrid.

And Boban believes that Ronaldo's obsession with himself made Real look ridiculous in the aftermath of the win, while his captaincy for Portugal led to a divided group unable to play as a team.

'Ronaldo is an amazing player and he showed that again in Brazil, even if he missed a number of chances,' Boban said in his column for Croatian paper Sportske Novosti. 'But his biggest flaw is the way he looks at himself and the team.

'He scored the 4-1 in the 120th minute of the Champions League final and celebrated like he was insane. That was the ultimate proof that he loves himself. The headlines should be about the team, not about Ronaldo.

'The same thing happened with Portugal in Brazil. There was no order or discipline. All the Portugal players were playing their own game and more occupied with their hair and tattoos. It's Hollywood behaviour.

'It's almost as if the players wanted to show there's more to Portugal than Ronaldo. It's a sad thing that a team loses its identity because of an unbalanced captain, both for Ronaldo and for an entire generation.'
