An 'inspirational' mother lost her two-year battle to cancer on Christmas morning, minutes before her five-year-old boys woke up to open their presents.

Charity founder and blogger Kate Gross, who worked under two Prime Ministers early in her career, died peacefully at home in Cambridge yesterday.

Her mother, Jean, announced the 36-year-old had died at 6.29am, with enough time to say goodbye to husband Billy. 

But it was just ten minutes before her sons, twins Oscar and Isaac, woke up and asked 'is it morning?', ready to open their Christmas stockings.

Former prime minister Tony Blair, who is a patron of the charity she founded, led tributes to the mother-of-two, calling her a 'fabulous colleague' and a 'dear friend'. 

Ms Gross was the founding CEO of charity Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), which has helped bring a change to the continent. 

More recently, it has been involved in the fight against Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

When she was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago, Ms Gross documented her battle on her blog - where she dubbed the disease 'The Nuisance'.

After reading English at Oxford University, Ms Gross joined the civil service and worked in Downing Street for four years as a private secretary for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Ms Gross was the founding charity Africa Governance Initiative and was an aide to former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown

And this year, she was awarded an OBE for her services to the public and charitable sectors.

Ton Blair paid tribute to Kate Gross, calling her death 'utterly tragic' and described her as a 'dear friend'

Mr Blair said: 'Kate's death at such a young age is utterly tragic. My thoughts and prayers are with Billy, the boys, Kate's parents and her many friends.

'But the tragedy of her death only illuminates the magnificence of her life. Her work and her achievement will endure.

'She created and built AGI as an organisation that took a new and innovative approach to development and today is making change happen in many different African countries. 

'She gave it an ethos and spirit that is a unique combination of public service and enterprise. She took the small band of staff at the beginning and helped put together the flourishing and strong team of professionals which represent AGI today.

Mr Blair added: 'She was a fabulous colleague, a wonderful leader and a dear friend. Her illness saw her reach new heights as a writer and sage, giving everyone around her hope and purpose in their lives even as her own drew to a close. 

'Kate was an inspiration when she was with us. She will remain an inspiration now and for the future. She was a life changer and a life giver. 

'I feel privileged and proud to have worked with her and been part of her life.' 

Her mother wrote on the blog yesterday: 'Kate’s last two weeks were characterised by the same qualities that marked her life. 

'There was care for others: were we all OK, would we be OK, how could she make it OK for us?

'There was a decision not to complain.' 

Kate's mother wrote a 'Last Post' on her blog to announce her passing at 6.29am on Christmas Day

And earlier this month, Ms Gross wrote her poignant final blog post, entitled 'May Your Days Be Merry And Bright', in which she urged people to enjoy every moment as she prepared to enjoy her last Christmas with her family. 

She wrote: 'The ghost of Christmas Future will hang around our table this year. 

'As we decorate the tree, open our presents and sit down for lunch, I will not be the only one imagining what these same rituals will be like next December when I am no longer there.

'This is my last Christmas; 2015 is the last New Year I will see in. I am 36, my twin boys are not-yet-six, and I am dying from advanced colon cancer.

'I have had this disease for over two years, but now I am drawing in like the December nights, knocking on the door of what Philip Gould called the death zone – the great winding down we all will face when we have weeks, not more, left to live.'

And she concluded: 'My promise this year is to enjoy all of it. These days that lead up to it, not just the main event.

The grumpiness, anger and frustration with my best beloveds that are a reminder that I am alive and red blood still pumps through my veins. 

'I am pale imitation of the energetic parent I once was, but there is still pleasure to be gained from Christmas as a spectator sport. 

Her memoir, Late Fragments: Everything I Want to Tell You (About This Magnificent Life), comes out on January 15

'Though my Christmases past are blissful memories, I do not need to live there. The present is no idyll, but it’s what we have. And I intend to enjoy it. May you all do the same.'

Liz Lloyd, chair of the AGI Board added: 'Kate was the first leader of AGI, taking it from a an idea to a fully formed organisation with a growing reputation and credibility amongst our partners and those we work with. 

'She was funny, chic and had a sharp eye for detail. She will always be remembered as the founding CEO who established AGI and prepared it for success in the future.' 

She added: 'On a personal level she has been my friend over these many years and I treasure especially the moments and experiences we have shared over the last year or so.'

The charity's CEO Nick Thompson added:  'We are all heartbroken by the news of Kate's death. 

'If life is to be measured in achievements rather than years, then Kate set the standard to which we will always aspire. 

'She stood apart in so many ways, and through her combination of optimism and steel inspired and challenged us always. We are proud to be a part of her legacy.

'In the last two years she demonstrated also that she was an incredible writer, with an ability to see life and to tell it as it is. No tribute can capture the essence of Kate as well as she did herself in her book and her blog. 

'That people around the world have drawn comfort and strength from her extraordinary words, written in her final weeks and months, is itself a remarkable gift and achievement.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Billy and her family, who will always be a part of our family too.'
