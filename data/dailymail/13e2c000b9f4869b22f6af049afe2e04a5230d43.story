Hospitals could start charging patients up to £75-a-night for their 'bed and board' if the health service's looming financial crisis is not addressed, it has been claimed.

Patients could be asked to pay 'hotel costs' if funding does not match increasing demand, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation warned.

Rob Webster, of the confederation which represents NHS commissioners and providers, said the health service would have to make 'tough choices'.

A senior NHS source claims the health service could charge patients up to £75-a-night for a bed (file picture)

He told The Independent: 'If the NHS cannot afford to fund everything, then it will need to make tough choices about what it does fund.

'Do we think about increasing our tolerance for longer wait (for care), or do we say: "NHS funding is only for the health aspects of care and treatment", which means patients being asked to cover their hotel costs for bed and board?'

'Overall funding allocation for health and social care is a political choice. Flat funding in real terms is a choice. Funding that doesn't match an increase in demand is a choice.

'One-off 'lumps' of money, which gets newspaper headlines but don't allow health service leaders to plan effectively, are a choice.'

He said plans to charge patients for accommodation had not been drawn up but an unnamed senior NHS source suggested to the newspaper that the fee could be £75 per night.

However, a Department of Health spokesman denied that plans to charge for hospital stays were under consideration and said: 'The NHS will remain free at the point of use.

'We know that with an ageing population there's more pressure on the NHS, which is why we've increased the budget by £12.7billion over this parliament and are investing in community services to keep people living healthier at home for longer.'

The spokesman added: 'These proposals are not under consideration.'

It comes after a cohort of influential health bodies issued an open letter to the leaders of all three main parties stating the NHS was at 'breaking point'.

The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have all focused on the NHS and its funding during their respective party conferences.

David Cameron vowed to protect NHS budgets until 2020, the Lib Dems said they would considering adding a further £1billion-a-year and Labour pledged an extra £2.5billion - although it later emerged that money would not be available in their first year of government. 

The British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs, among others, have said a funding crisis threatens the core tenet of the public health service being free at the point of access.

They cautioned: 'Savings have been made, and despite the best efforts of nurses, doctors and other staff, patients have not been insulated from these cuts.

'Too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients.

'The NHS and our social care services are at breaking point and things cannot go on like this. An NHS deficit of £30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled.

'While we welcome the fact that the NHS has risen to the top of the political agenda, and some new spending commitments have been made, we need a comprehensive, fully costed, long-term spending plan if an NHS true to its founding principles of universal healthcare, provided according to need not ability to pay, is secured for future generations.'

It comes after former Labour health minister, Lord Warner, warned that the NHS was 'unaffordable', 'out-of-date' and unable to meet the needs of the population.

In July, he said everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, and he called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment.

He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the health service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population.

Members of the Royal College of Nursing also called for patients to pay up to £10 to see their family doctor to generate vital NHS funding while also deterring patients from making appointments and then failing to show up, but later voted against it.

The NHS's annual budget currently stands at £114billion, up by more than £12.7billion on 2010.

But bosses claim that, once inflation is taken into account, that works out at less than a 0.1 per cent annual increase. 

The NHS started in July 1948 to eradicate one of the five 'giants evils' identified by economist William Beveridge - 'want, disease, squalor, ignorance, idleness'.

Health secretary Aneurin Bevan, the creator of the service, designed it to bring hospitals, pharmacists, opticians and dentists together under one organisation that would be free for all.

Charges have since been brought in for prescriptions and dental procedures but medical treatment at doctors' surgeries and in hospitals has always been free – including overnight stays.

From its beginning the health service has struggled to stay within budget, and the money set aside for free glasses for the organisation's first nine months was used up in just six weeks.

Original estimates were that the service would cost taxpayers £140million a year by 1950, but its budget for that year was in fact £358million.

Economists say the price of healthcare rises faster than the rate of inflation because of the spiraling costs of new drugs and the effects of  Britain's aging population and growing obesity problems.

In the last ten years, NHS funding has risen from around £1,300 per person in England to more than £1,979 per person.

Statistics released last year reveal the health service employs nearly 150,000 doctors, around 400,000 nurses, 150,000 scientists and more than 35,000 managers.

Last year saw a rise in the number of staff by around 18,000, with the top performing trusts spending an extra £1.2billion, £660million more than planned.

Chiefs had hoped to cut budgets by treating more patients in the community rather than in hospitals, but figures show emergency admissions and outpatient appointments have both risen.

Hospitals are said to be running over budget to avoid a scandal like that at Stafford Hospital, where police investigated more than 300 deaths said to be due neglect or poor care.
