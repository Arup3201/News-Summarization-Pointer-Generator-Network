Ally McCoist has refused to comment on whether he offered to resign as Rangers manager but did say he was '100 per cent committed' to the club.

The 52-year-old has come under pressure from supporters in recent weeks, with the Glasgow giants trailing Hearts by nine points in the race to win promotion to the Scottish Premiership, and various reports on Friday suggested he had tendered his resignation.

However McCoist took charge of the Light Blues for their Scottish Championship match at Queen of the South.

The club have refused to comment on the story and speaking to BT Sport before the game in Dumfries, McCoist was more interested in talking about the match.

'I am completely focused on the game and I can't comment on anything else,' he told BT Sport. 'You'd need to task the club about all that.

'I've no idea if this will be my last game. I certainly hope not.

'I've no plan to talk to the board and there's nothing on my mind other than picking up three points.

'I can assure (the fans) I am 100 per cent committed on getting them back to the top.'

And despite the hefty points difference between themselves and Hearts, McCoist believes his side can still go up to the Premiership as champions.

'(I) absolutely believe it (we can catch Hearts),' he added. 'I watched their game last week, we firmly believe we have to put pressure on Hearts, no easy job that is for sure.'

McCoist was a real Ibrox favourite as a player, scoring 355 goals in all and was part of the Rangers team which won nine league titles in a row in the 1980s and 1990s.

However, McCoist's tenure as boss since taking over from Walter Smith in 2011 has been far from plain sailing.

Supporters' criticism of his tactics and signings have increased this season in the wake of some poor performances and results.

Aside from defeats to Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian, the Gers have failed to beat Alloa in three attempts, with the recent 3-2 Challenge Cup defeat to the Wasps - after blowing a two-goal lead - bringing McCoist's managerial abilities under even more intense scrutiny.

In addition to general disgruntlement at Rangers' performances and style of play, the seemingly-endless battle for power at the cash-strapped club over the past few years has left many fans disillusioned and that has led to falling attendances at Ibrox.
