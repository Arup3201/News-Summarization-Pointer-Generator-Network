A grandmother from Cardiff who was taken to Ibiza by her family to celebrate her birthday died after contracting a Legionella infection, which her family claims could have been caused by contaminated water.

Lynne Balaam and her sister Kathleen Laddell, 52, both fell sick just days into a 10-day trip arranged through Thomson Holidays to the popular resort area of Santa Eulalia.

Lynne died four weeks later on October 18 while Kathleen has made a full recovery and returned to the house she shared with her sister in Ely, Cardiff. 

'Our world has fallen apart,' said Kathleen. 'It was a holiday to celebrate Lynne's 59th birthday. The family is in shock.'

The C'an Sanso apartments, where they were staying, were shut days after Lynne tested positive for Legionella and remain closed, the family say.  

Lynne's family have accused Thomson of not doing enough to help the sisters after they fell ill. 

A spokesman for Thomson said staff had been supporting the family and stressed that 'no clear link has been made between the apartments and the heightened risk of water contamination'.

Lynne and Kathleen arrived on the Spanish island on September 22 with Lynne's grandson Michael Badham, 17, and Kathleen's partner Leigh Charalambos.

The sisters soon reported other holidaymakers at the resort were suffering stomach problems before showing symptoms of their own within three days.

Kathleen was first taken to hospital followed by Lynne. Kathleen was diagnosed with pneumonia and spent a week in hospital. 

Lynne's condition was harder to pin down but blood tests later showed her to have been infected with the Legionella bacterium, Lynne's daughter Emma Takata and stepdaughter Sacha Protheroe confirmed.

Family members from Wales, who flew to be with Lynne in Ibiza on October 5 when told of the Legionella diagnosis, say they arrived to be told she had only days to live. 

A potentially fatal type of bacterial pneumonia that was first identified after an outbreak at an American Legion meeting in 1976.

According to the NHS, those at a higher risk of contracting the disease include people over 45 years of age, smokers and heavy drinkers, people suffering from chronic respiratory or kidney disease, diabetes, lung and heart disease, or anyone with an impaired immune system.

The illness is usually contracted by exposure to the legionella bacterium when it grows in purpose-built systems where water is kept at a warm enough temperature to encourage growth, such as air-conditioners, cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water systems and spas or heated pools.

Doctors told them they believed Lynne may have caught the bug from the apartment water systems.

Sacha, who lives in Rhoose,  teenage grandson Michael was alone with Lynne when her condition took a turn for the worse and he was left to take her to the hospital in a taxi. 

Sacha says while Michael did all he could to help by rushing Lynne to the nearest medical support, the 17-year-old is now inconsolable.

Lynne's daughter Emma, 29, who suffers from epilepsy caused by a brain tumour, was so shocked by her mother's condition she had a seizure by her bedside.

'I was told on October 1 my mother was ill,' she said. 'By October 3 she was in hospital in intensive care. I flew out on October 5 and went straight to see her. She was on a respirator, not conscious and wired up ... The shock of seeing her like that caused me to have a seizure.'

Sacha, 34, whose father Joseph Protheroe has also now flown to the island, said the apartments are still shut. 'My father went there and says they are all taped up,' she said.

Kathleen, 52, broke down in tears when she recalled how the holiday turned to tragedy.

'We arrived on September 22 and within two days we woke up with diarrhoea. A lot of people at the apartments had tummy problems,' she said.

'My partner Leigh took me to a private hospital through our insurance the following Wednesday because I was having breathing problems. I was in hospital for eight days and while I was there Lynne was taken to another hospital by Michael.'

Unaware of how ill her older sister was Kathleen was stunned when she was discharged from hospital and went straight to see her.

'The first time I saw my sister was on October 8 when I was discharged. I was absolutely devastated to see her. I heard she had gone to hospital but was completely shocked to see her so ill,' she said.

Emma and her sister Clair Pucky-Brown, 35, remain on the island as they try to repatriate their mother's body. 

They have been issued with a temporary Spanish death certificate which says Lynne died from multiple organ failure, despite doctors saying Lynne had Legionella.  

The family has been in contact with the British Consulate on the island.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.'

A spokesman for Thomson said: 'We are aware that a guest who stayed at the C'an Sanso Apartments in Ibiza has sadly died. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this extremely difficult time. Together with the British Consulate our team in resort has been supporting the family and will continue to do so until they are ready to return home.

'Whilst no clear link has been made between the apartments and the heightened risk of water contamination, as a precaution Thomson arranged alternative accommodation for all guests who were either staying in or due to travel to the hotel.'
