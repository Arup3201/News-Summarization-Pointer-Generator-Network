Charles Saatchi today denied 'throttling' his ex-wife as he sat outside a central London restaurant in June.

The 70-year-old told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court today he did not 'strangle' her, but trying to 'make her focus' on what he was saying.

He added that they were not talking about her alleged drug abuse at the time.

Mr Saatchi refuted claims he 'gripped' his ex-wife's neck while giving evidence at the trial of his former employees Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, who are accused of using credit cards loaned to them to spend more than Â£685,000.

Confrontation: The 70-year-old told the jury he was trying to 'make her focus' on what he was saying

Referring again to the incident outside Scott's Restaurant in Mayfair, central London, Mr Saatchi said: 'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be clear?

'Was it about her drug use? No.'

When asked by Anthony Metzer QC, defending, if he became aware of Ms Lawson's alleged drug-taking around the time of the 'Scott's Restaurant incident', he said it was indeed around that time.

The pair divorced after the photo of the confrontation outside the Mayfair restaurant surfaced Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault.

He told Isleworth Crown Court he has no proof of Miss Lawson's alleged drug-taking.

Responding to defence barrister Anthony Metzer QC, he said: 'Like you, I like proof. I have no proof.'

He
 later said: 'I have never, never seen any evidence of Nigella taking 
any drug whatsoever. I want to be helpful, but I genuinely have no real 
knowledge at all.'

Mr Metzer asked if he was 'shocked', to which Mr Saatchi said he was.

'I'm very against drugs,' he added.

Earlier, the court was read an email the millionaire sent to Miss Lawson on October 10 which contained allegations of drug taking. The message was first read to the court during a pre-trial hearing.

In it he referred to his ex-wife as 'Higella' - which he described as a 'silly pun'.He wrote: 'Nigella, I was sent these by a newspaper and I can only laugh at your sorry depravity. 

Charles Saatchi denied he was strangling Nigella as he gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court

Mr Saatchi was surrounded by photographers after leaving Isleworth Crown Court today, where he gave evidence in the trial of his former assistants

'Of course now the Grillos will get 
off on the basis that you... were so off your heads on drugs that you 
allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked and yes I believe every
 word the Grillos have said, who after all only stole money.'

The
 email went on: 'But I'm sure it was all great fun and now everything is
 perfect - bravo, you have become a celebrity hostess on a global TV 
game show. And you got the Pass you desired, free to heartily enjoy all 
the drugs you want, forever. Classy.'

Questioned
 about the message by prosecutor Jane Carpenter, Mr Saatchi said: 'I'm 
utterly bereft that this private email to Nigella has come back to haunt
 us both. That's all I have to say.

'The
 stories that the Grillos were parading was that Nigella had a severe 
cocaine habit that stretched back a very long time for the entirety of 
our marriage.

When asked
 if he had adored Miss Lawson during their marriage, he said: 'I adore 
Nigella now. I absolutely adore Nigella and I'm broken-hearted to have 
lost her.'

Questioned about the drug-taking allegations, Mr Saatchi told the court: 'It was hearsay. I personally have absolutely no knowledge that Nigella has ever taken a drug ever.

'I don't like drugs at all and I didn't like reading what the Grillos said was the culture in my house.'

Asked if he believed the claims, Mr Saatchi went on: 'I may have believed it but I may have been completely wrong and they may have been deluded.

'Like I said, you like proof in this courtroom and I cannot provide proof.'

Mr Saatchi described the 'Higella' reference as a 'silly pun'.

He was also asked about why he wrote in the email that his ex-wife now had a 'free pass'.

Allegations: The sisters, who are on trial for fraud, claim Nigella had a 'very sensitive' cocaine habit

Mr Saatchi told jurors: 'In one of the very rare conversations I've had with Nigella since we split, I asked her whether she was happy.

'And she said she was happy. And I said 'What was this all about?'

'She said 'I'm happy because I don't feel I have to ask for a pass to do what I feel like doing'.

'And I said to her 'You never had to ask for a pass, you could do whatever you liked. If you wanted to have a girls' night or go to a party then you were free to do so. What do you mean?'

'I was just being nasty,' he added.

'This is not a very pleasant email but I was very, very upset.

'What I gathered was now that she was divorced from me she was free to do whatever she wants.'

The trail has been adjourned until Wednesday when Mr Saatchi is expected to be back in court to give evidence.
