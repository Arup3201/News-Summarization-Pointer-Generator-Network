An obese horseback rider has lost almost six stone in just ten months after worrying her weight was hurting her horse.

Lezley Picton, 52, ballooned to 16 stone after indulging in high-fat convenience snacks she would pick up on her way home form the stables including sausage rolls, crisps and full-fat cola.

But she began to worry about injuring her 15 hands high Welsh cob Maddy after she noticed the seven-year-old horse getting short of breath while she rode her.

Lezley, who shed five stone in just 10 months, at her stables in Shrewsbury, Shropshire

The mother-of-one, from Eaton Mascott, Shropshire, joined her local Slimming World group and in just 10 months lost five-and-a-half stone and shrank eight dress sizes.

She now weighs 10.5 stone - going from a size 26 to a svelte size 10. Lezley, who lives with her partner Claire, 53, is now back in the saddle.

She said: 'I have always struggled with my weight. Horses are meant to be able to carry a big weight but as a responsible horse owner I did feel sorry for them carrying me.

'It wasn't much fun for me either because I was uncomfortable and I struggled to put my wellies and jodhpurs over my calves.'

Lesley once ripped her jodhpurs and was shocked to find the next two sizes up didn't fit her when she went shopping for a replacement pair.

'Miserable': Lezley in 2011 and 2012, when she weighed 16 stone - she said she is happier since losing weight

'Being overweight had made me so miserable, I had to do something about it, and the jodhpurs episode was the final straw. I just found picking up something snacky was much easier than cooking from scratch.

'You're on our way home and the crisps and sausage rolls at the petrol station just look so inviting.

'I tried 
loads of those fad diets, I was a real yo-yo dieter, you know the ones 
where you don't eat and then lost a load of weight before putting it all
 back on.

'I was so miserable, I was just a horrible person to live with.

'My friend suggested I accompany her to her Slimming World, I was nervous but I shouldn't have been, the members were so welcoming that I felt at home right away.

'I was worried that I wouldn't be able to eat all my favourite foods but with food optimising I was amazed at what I could eat. 

'I still eat bread, fish and chips, curries and chocolate - I've just changed the way I eat and how I cook.

Back in the saddle: Lezley still eats bread, chips, curries and chocolate but has changed how she cooks

Breakfast - Cereal

Lunch - Sausage roll, crisps, sandwich

Dinner - Restaurant curry or sausage roll

Snacks - Crisps, pasty

Breakfast - Cereal or fruit

Lunch - Sandwich

Dinner - Homemade curry

Snacks - None

'I feel so much better in myself, I don't even break a sweat when I'm mucking the horses out now.

'I can't 
thank Claire enough, she is an absolute rock to me, she came onto the 
diet with me eating the same things despite the fact that she didn't 
need to lose weight.

'I just feel so much better now.'

Lezley has now trained as a consultant for Slimming World and has taken over her own group.

She added: 'Obesity is becoming such a huge issue across the UK. 

'When I first joined Slimming World as a member, I never dreamed that I would end up helping other people to lose weight but now I just can't wait to get started. 

'It's a privilege for me to be able to pass on the experience, insight and understanding that helped me, so that I can give my members the support they need to get to target.'
