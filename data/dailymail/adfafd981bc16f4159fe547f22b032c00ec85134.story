President Ramzan Kadyrov said the British Foreign Office's safety warnings were incorrect and visitors to Chechnya were safer there than they would be in England

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said his country is safer than England, despite it being a no-go zone for travellers.

The rebel-turned-President claimed Chechnya is not only safe to visit, but less risky than Western countries.

Tourists are advised to stay away from Chechnya by the Foreign Office because of the risk of terrorist activity and violent crime.

Mr Kadyroy appealed to tourists on his Twitter account in response to the Foreign Office's advice to stay away, which was updated last Friday.

'I am stating with entire responsibility that it is safer in Chechnya than in England! Welcome!' he said.

The Russian Republic, in the North Causcus, hit the headlines last month as the birthplace of Boston bombers,Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

The men behind the fatal bombing put Chechnya - the former site of a bloody separatist insurgency - back on the world's front pages.

The Tsarnaevs are believed to have moved to the US from Russian Republic of Dagestan in 2002 and had retained links to Chechnya.

Dzhokhar maintained a page on the 
Russian social networking site VKontakte, where he was a member of 
Chechen groups.

Tamerlan is said to have travelled to Russia for several months last 
year and the trip reportedly included a brief return to Dagestan.

The Foreign Office called on British 
nationals to avoid visiting the Russian North Caucasus region, including
Chechnya, Daghestan, Ingushetia, and several areas of Stavropol Krai, 
over terrorist threats.

Then: Grozny, the capital of Chechnya in 1995 was a hub of violent crime during the Civil War. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the 'most destroyed city on earth'

Now: Skyscrapers and the Heart of Chechnya mosque now dominate Grozny's skyline. Its streets have been rebuilt and money has been put into regeneration, but it is still seen as one of the world's most oppressive and dangerous cities

As head of Chechnya, President Kadyrov has been 
credited for bringing peace and stability to the region but has come 
under heavy criticism due to alleged corruption and human rights 
violations.

Moscow has been fighting militants 
since the mid 1990s in its North Caucasus region, with the republics of 
Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia witnessing sporadic attacks and 
militant clashes.

The predominantly Muslim region tried to break away from Russia in 1991 by declaring independence when the Soviet Union began to collapse.

250,000 people were forced from their homes because of a war between Chechen separatists and the Russian army.

Years of fighting with Russian forces 
ensued, eventually driving the rebels underground. Chechen rebels staged
increasingly bloody suicide bombings and hostage-taking raids around 
Russia.

While the situation in Chechnya has improved in recent years, sporadic attacks continue.

Moscow and Washington say the rebels have links to Islamic terror groups such as al-Qaeda and have fought Western forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

The Foreign Office raises lesser concerns about other 
parts of Russia, saying people should only visit if travel is essential 
or should be vigilant while they are there.
