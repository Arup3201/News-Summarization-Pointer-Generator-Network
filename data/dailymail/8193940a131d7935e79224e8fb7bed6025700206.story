Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Thiago Silva was arrested after 
barricading himself in his south Florida townhouse following threats to 
kill his estranged wife and others at a local martial arts gym, police 
said on Friday.

The Brazilian-born light heavyweight fighter was captured in a SWAT 
team operation on Thursday, when officers subdued him with a Taser after
 he refused to comply with their commands, the Broward County Sheriff's 
Office said.

Silva, 31, was charged with two counts of attempted murder, 
aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and obstruction without 
violence.

without bail, deeming him to be a flight risk and a danger to his wife.

Attorney Scott Saul said his client was presumed innocent.

'He is one of the premier professional fighters,' Saul said in court. 'It is hard for this man to hide.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the mixed martial arts promotion company 
that Silva joined in 2007 said on Friday the organization was ending the
 relationship.

'The Ultimate Fighting Championship has terminated the contract 
of Thiago Silva, effective immediately,'  spokesman Dave Sholler said in 
an email.

Silva's arrest followed run-ins in recent weeks with police over 
alleged verbal and physical threats to his wife, Thaysa Silva, from whom
 he has been separated since 2012.

Police said Thaysa Silva called them on 
Wednesday, alleging that Thiago had sent her a text message reading:: 
'...you're going to die, I'm going to hire someone to kill you and I'm 
going to move my girlfriend in the home,' NBC Miami reported.

Police said Thiago Silva drove to a ju-jitsu gym in suburban Fort 
Lauderdale on Thursday and threatened to shoot everyone inside if the 
owner, who dates Silva's wife, did not come outside.

The gym owner emerged to protect Thaysa Silva, he told police, then 
quickly ran back inside the building, locked the doors and called 911.

Police caught up with Thiago Silva as he returned home. While 
attempting to convince him to surrender, Silva 'gave them the middle 
finger ... and went inside the residence,' according to the affidavit.

Silva won 16 UFC bouts and lost three.

After testing positive for 
marijuana in 2012, he agreed to a six-month ban from the sport and 
entered a drug rehab program, according to UFC owner Zuffa LLC.

UFC fighters use an eclectic form of fighting called mixed martial 
arts.

The brutal technique combines boxing, kickboxing, wrestling and 
karate, often leaving fighters' faces swollen to the point of being 
unrecognizable after a bout.

Over the past decade, the fights have gone from an underground sport 
to a full-fledged phenomenon attracting major advertisers and coverage 
on prominent sports television networks.
