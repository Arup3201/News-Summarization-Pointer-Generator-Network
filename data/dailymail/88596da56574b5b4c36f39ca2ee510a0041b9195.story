With her glowing skin and yogi body, 45-year-old supermodel Christy Turlington is the walking picture of health.

So it comes as little surprise that the mother and maternal health advocate has been snapped up by beauty supplement brand Imedeen to become its global ambassador.

'For us Christy is the true embodiment of what Imedeen represents,' said a spokesperson for Imedeen.

And right they are, as the yoga enthusiast showcases a wrinkle-free complexion in imagery released by the supplement, which promises to boost your complexion.

Speaking about her latest gig, Turlington said: 'It's very important for me to maintain great looking skin - not only as a model, but as a woman with lots of demands and many roles to fill each day.

'Now more than ever it's important that I nourish myself in every way possible to take care of my health and well-being. Caring for my skin on the inside is just as important as how I care for the outside.

'Now I can count on Imedeen to deliver deep down nourishment where it matters most.'

The New York based model became a household name as the face of Calvin Klein from 1987 to 2007.

She has also worked with the likes of Maybelline and Versace and founded Every Mother Counts (EMC) in 2010 - a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to end preventable deaths caused by pregnancy and childbirth around the world.

The organisation also encourages 
people to take action to improve health and well-being of girls and 
women worldwide. As part of the partnership, a donation will be made to 
EMC on behalf of the Imedeen brand to support Christy’s honourable work.

'Christy
 is a true professional and it’s been an amazing experience to be 
working with someone that exudes beauty, inside and out,' added the 
spokesperson.
