Two extremist groups - UK-based Minbar Ansar Deen and Nigeria-based Boko Haram - are to be banned in the UK under terrorism laws.

If the new law is passed it will membership of the groups as well as support for them a criminal offence.

Home Secretary Theresa May is to lay an order which, if approved by Parliament, will ban both of the radical Islamist organisations from operating in the UK from midnight on Friday morning.

Operating: Home Secretary Theresa May is to lay an order which, if approved by Parliament, will ban both of the radical Islamist organisations from operating in the UK. Decisions to proscribe the organisations are understood to be unrelated to the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby, right, in south-east London in May

Banned: Journalists look at arms and ammunition which military commanders say they seized from Islamic fighters, in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Boko Haram, the radical group that once attacked only government institutions and security forces, is increasingly targeting civilians

 Boko Haram - which in the Hausa language spoken in northern Nigeria means 'Western education is sinful' - is loosely modelled on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan.  Boko Haram became active in around 2003 and is concentrated mainly in the northern Nigerian states.

The group considers all who do not follow its strict ideology as infidels, whether they are Christian or Muslim. It demands the adoption of Islamic law, sharia, in all of Nigeria.  

Boko Haram followers have prayed in separate mosques in cities including Maiduguri, Kano and Sokoto, and wear long beards and red or black headscarves.    

In early July 2010, Abubakar Shekau, a former deputy leader of the sect who was thought to have been killed by police in 2009, appeared in a video and claimed leadership of the group. He said he was ready to launch attacks on western influences in Nigeria. Rights groups say more than 250 people have been killed by Boko Haram since July 2010.

Minbar Ansar Deen - also known as Ansar 
al-Sharia UK - promotes terrorism by distributing content through its 
online forum, which encourages individuals to travel overseas to engage 
in extremist activity, specifically fighting, the Home Office said.

The Government said banning Boko Haram, which aspires to establish Islamic law in Nigeria, will prevent the group from operating in the UK and give the police powers to tackle any UK-based support for the group.

Decisions to proscribe the organisations are understood to be unrelated to the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby near Woolwich barracks in south-east London in May.

The penalties for proscription offences can be a maximum of 10 years in prison or a £5,000 fine.Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the Home Secretary can proscribe an organisation if it is believed to be concerned in terrorism.

However, a high threshold, taking into 
account the threat the group poses to the UK, must be met for the 
minister to go ahead and proscribe an organisation.

If
 approved by Parliament, it will be a criminal offence to belong to or 
back Minbar Ansar Deen or Boko Haram, as well arrange meetings or wear 
clothing in support of them.

Other proscribed groups include al Qaida, Al Shabaab and Islam4UK, which before it was banned was led by Anjem Choudary.
