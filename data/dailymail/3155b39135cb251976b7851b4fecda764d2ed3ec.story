Outraged smartphone users have criticised a game for encouraging young women to behave violently to their partners.

The 'Boyfriend Trainer' app has the users play the 'girlfriend' and asks them to advance through the game by attacking the 'boyfriend' when he misbehaves.

'Crack that whip and teach your guy a thing or two about being the Perfect Boyfriend!' it says. 'When scolding doesn’t work, just zap him, whack him and train him to be your ideal man!'

Violent: Boyfriend Trainer asks players to lash out to train their partner to be 'the perfect boyfriend'

Bull's eye: Some users have accused the app of encouraging girls to be abusive towards their partners

Available for free on both Android and iPhone, the game is marketed by Mumbai-based Games2win India, which makes a range of cartoon-like apps aimed at the female market.

Others include such titles as My Bridal Boutique, Wedding Dress Stylist and Teen 17 Beauty Queen, as well as racier options like a series of 'Naughty' games with names like Naughty Secretary, Naughty Air Hostess and, worryingly, Naughty High School.

All are also playable online as Flash games which work through users' internet browsers.

Boyfriend Trainer begins with a set of instructions which reads: 'Boyfriend's got a roving eye? Control it.

'Click on him to hit him when he checks out the girls. Fill up the Perfection Meter to get through the level.'

Increasingly painful: Subsequent levels have the player using a variety of tools to discipline their fictional lover

The first level's simple gameplay consists of a cartoon couple sitting outside a cafe, sharing a drink, as other women wander past.

When the boyfriend's 'roving eye' settles on one he finds attractive the player must tap his face to command the girlfriend character to slap him - leaving a painful looking red welt.

Other levels see the girlfriend character 'training' her boyfriend not to drop mess up the flat they share by zapping him with a taser whenever he drops items, or hitting with a tennis racket when he changes the channel on the television.

Free to play: The game is available for both iPhone and Android, and as a browser playable Flash game

Although it has been given a respectable rating of three-and-a-half stars by customers, some commented to say that they disagreed with the message the game gives to youngsters.

'This app is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!' wrote CAKE LOVER on the iTunes store. 'If I could rate 0 [stars] I would!

'The girl just slaps the guy and acts like she's in charge I mean, girls don't act like this! DO NOT buy this game!'
