A stranger has been allowed to get through airport security on another person's boarding pass after American Airlines issued him the wrong ticket.

Brad Gertz was stunned when he went to Philadelphia International Airport to check into his flight for Chicago on Sunday to be told: 'You're already on the flight.'

It turned out that staff had accidentally issued his boarding pass to another passenger who had then switched his flight to an earlier take-off time.

The unidentified man managed to get through TSA security checkpoints despite having a different name on the boarding pass to his ID. The mistake was only spotted when he tried to board.

Shocked: Brad Gertz was stunned to arrive at Philadelphia International Airport to be told that he was already on a plane bound for Chicago. He learned that the airline had mistakenly given someone his boarding pass

But American Airlines' systems failed to update and it still appeared as though Gertz was on the flight, alerting him to the mistake.

Speaking to CBS2, Gertz said he was stunned to learn he was supposedly already onboard.

'I showed him my ID and said, "I'm Brad Gertz, what's going on?"' he said. 'I can tell you, I lost all color in my face, I was nervous and furious.'

He said that he immediately thought his identity had been stolen.

'God forbid this guy did something stupid. My name, my identity is attached,' he said.

Demanding answers: Even though the mistake was caught before the stranger boarded the plane, the airline's systems failed to update. When Gertz tweeted them, they insisted he was in the air

Told he could not take his flight, he frantically tweeted American Airlines, who also told him that their systems showed he was already on a Chicago-bound plane.

He eventually boarded a flight and arrived back in Chicago - but he still demanded answers.

American Airlines admitted to CBS that a man was mistakenly given the boarding pass and made it past the TSA checkpoint but he was stopped before boarding.

'One of our employees realized the error after it happened and gave the other passenger the correct boarding pass,' the airline said in a statement.

'Because of this mistake, it appeared that Mr. Gertz was already checked in for and set to take an earlier flight. Mr. Gertzâ€™s itinerary was not updated to reflect the mistake until he arrived at the airport later that morning to check in for his originally scheduled flight.'

But Gertz said the answer was not enough adding: 'This person, whoever this was, that got through under my identity that easy and made it to the gate? Who says anyone else can't?

'I was compromised/ I can't explain the 
emotion that goes through you when American Airlines themselves tells 
you you're on a flight.'

The airline has offered Gertz a $300 voucher as a sign of goodwill, it said. But Gertz responded that the flight typically costs $600.

TSA told WPVI that it is reviewing the incident to see how their mistakes occurred.

'Passengers are subject to a robust security system that employs multiple layers, including watch list matching, thorough screening at the checkpoint, Federal Air Marshals, armed pilots and a vigilant public, as well as many others, both seen and unseen,' the statement said.
