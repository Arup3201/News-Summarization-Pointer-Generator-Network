Jurors on Thursday were shown a to-do list written by former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez shortly before murder victim Odin Lloyd was shot dead.

The list, which was on Hernandez's Blackberry, contains mostly football related tasks, like purchasing fish oil, watching game film and memorizing the playbook, but also says 'send rounds.'

And according to Kyle Aspinwall, who works for Glock and is testifying for the prosecution, this is another way of saying purchase ammunition.

The list also included 'troll,' a form of online harassment generally popular among teenagers.

This as the jury was asked to disregard some of the expert testimony delivered by Aspinwall on Wednesday when he claimed that Hernandez could be seen holding a gun on security footage from inside his home both before and after the time Lloyd is believed to have been killed.

Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said that jurors were to disregard some of the identifying characteristics of the gun Aspinwall testified to, and also reminded them that he was speaking to his opinion, which they could accept or disregard.

Aspinwall said Hernandez appeared to be carrying a Glock in his residence around 3:30am on June 17, just minutes after Lloyd was killed in a nearby industrial park with what the prosecution claims was a .45-caliber Glock handgun.

When questioned by the defense however, Aspinwall said he could not say if the gun was a functioning gun or even a pellet gun.

The defense also went after him by pointing out that if it was indeed a gun, Hernandez would have to be holding it by the muzzle, something that would be incredibly unsafe should the weapon accidentally fire. 

Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty the to murder of Lloyd.

He is also charged in another case with the murder of two Boston men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub. 

He has pleaded not guilty in that case too.
