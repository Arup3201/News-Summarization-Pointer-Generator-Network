A Connecticut mother was left red-faced with embarrassment and then burning with rage after her four-year-old son was banned from a doughnut shop for asking if a lady was pregnant on Tuesday.

Rebecca Denham said when her son mistakenly asked a customer in Monroe's Doughnut Inn on Monday if she was carrying a child - she was understandably mortified.

However, the next day when they tried to walk back in, they 'were screamed at in front of the door,' said Denham. They said her son, Justin Otero, was not 'allowed in here' because he 'is rude.'

Recalling her inquisitive son's error on Monday, Denham said that when the woman said 'no' to being pregnant, her son said sorry but she was suitably shocked.

'My response was 'Oh my goodness, I'm so embarrassed, I'm so sorry', Denham said to WFSB.

Seriously? Rebecca Denham has said that now she has calmed down she will no longer be spending any more money at the doughnut store in Monroe, Connecticut

The lady in question even said it was okay, but the managers at the Doughnut Inn apparently did not see it the same way when they tried to walk in on Tuesday.

'She said, 'he's not allowed in here,' and I looked around, and said, 'him?' and she said 'yeah, he's rude',' Denham said to WFSB.

Leaving the store to take their money elsewhere, Denham has said she has tried to explain the situation to her son and that he 'sort of' understands.

'Some people, unfortunately are quick to pass judgment, and therefore we will take our money and business elsewhere,' Denham added.
