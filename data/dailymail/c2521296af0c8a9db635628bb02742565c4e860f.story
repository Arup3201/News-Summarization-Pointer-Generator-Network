A grandfather has been praised for his heroic actions after he overpowered a masked, gun-wielding thug who was raiding his 94-year-old neighbour's home.

Bernard Ryan, 68, put a glass to the wall after hearing cries from the elderly woman, and overheard her telling him there was no more money in the house.

Realising she was in danger, the retired joiner rushed from his home and wrestled career criminal Phillip Gaskell to the floor, ignoring the pistol being brandished in his face - and the trigger pulled.

A judge praised Mr Ryan's heroic actions after jailing Gaskell, 48, for 12 years at Leeds Crown Court.

Mr Ryan said: 'I didn't really have time to think about what I was doing, I just did it.

'I just thought, how dare anyone do that? How could somebody be so low?'

The court heard how heard the victim was at home with her carer, Jannae Bezundenhoug, on October 30, when Gaskell, wearing a balaclava, knocked on the door.

Christopher Moran, prosecuting, said he forced his way in and told Miss Bezundenhoug 'shut up or you're going to die' when she started screaming.

As he demanded cash, Miss Bezundenhoug ran to the elderly woman and hugged her, but Gaskell ordered them into the living room and pushed the elderly woman to the floor.

He rifled through her belongings before telling her: 'If you haven't got any cash get me your jewellery.'

The court heard the carer tried to put Gaskell in a headlock and stuck her fingers in his eye.

Mr Moran said Gaskell told her: 'That's the biggest mistake you're going to make for the rest of your life.'

But help was at hand when retired joiner Mr Ryan, who was at home with his wife Marlene, heard shouting coming from next door.

Concerned for his neighbour, Mr Ryan dashed out of his home and went round to his neighbour's home - where he was immediately confronted by Gaskell, who pointed the gun at him.

He said: 'It sounds silly, but we put a glass to the wall to try to work out what was being said.

'It worked - we could hear them shouting 'there's no more money in the house'.'

'I didn't have a second to be frightened.

'His big mistake was pulling the trigger, because then it was obvious it wasn't real. We got each other in a kind of bear hug and were wrestling and rolling around.

'I'm much bigger than him and I managed to get him into the bedroom and pin him down. He starting saying he had asthma and was going to have an attack.'

The elderly woman then grabbed a hammer and started hitting Gaskell with it.

Police arrived within minutes and took him away.

The court heard the pensioner no longer felt safe at home, while the carer was too terrified to return to look after her.

Gaskell, who has several robbery convictions, admitted two offences of attempted robbery and possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear.

Judge Christopher Batty commended Mr Ryan and Miss Bezundenhoug as he sentenced 'dangerous' Gaskell, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, to 12 years with an extended period of five years on licence.

Praising Mr Ryan, the judge said: 'Your behaviour on that day was incredibly brave. Your fearless determination not only prevented more serious emotional trauma for both these ladies but brought this man to book.'

He awarded £250 from public funds to Mr Ryan and Miss Bezundenhoug in recognition of their bravery.

Following the sentence, Mr Ryan said: 'I'm not normally the sort of person who would see something kicking off and automatically jump in, but I'd like to think I'd do the same again.'

His wife Marlene said: 'He's not the kind of person who can stand back and ignore someone in need. He jumped straight up when he realised she was in trouble. I was close behind him but not too close!

'I'm so proud of him. I was a little bit angry to begin with because he could easily have been hurt but I'm proud that he went to help somebody in need. It could have been a completely different story.'
