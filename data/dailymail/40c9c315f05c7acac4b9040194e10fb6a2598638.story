A less-than-jolly Santa Claus shamed shoppers lined up outside retail stores on Thursday night in anticipation of the Black Friday sales.

The stern Santa was activist, author and conspiracy theorist Mark Dice, 35, who slowly drove past lines of would-be shoppers and berated them through a megaphone for 'ruining the tradition of Thanksgiving.'

'Thank you for not spending time with grandma and grandpa and leaving them and destroying the very fabric of society to buy more slave goods,' he told bewildered shoppers outside a San Diego Kohl's store.

'I bet you don't even have a retirement plan, do you?' he said.'I bet you don't have an ounce of silver. But you're going to go buy more garbage with credit cards to impress people you don't even like with money you don't even have. Way to go, debt slaves!'Dice told InfoWars.com's Alex Jones that he felt so disenchanted by the state of America's family values, credit card debt and rampant consumerism that he was compelled to say something about it. 'It did get a little caustic, but someone has to try to reach these people,' he said.'They are destroying the very fabric of the family... On Thanksgiving, a day when we're supposed to be thankful for what we have, they're sacrificing their families to go and get more iPhones, more iPads, bigger televisions so that they can isolate themselves in their own little world.'

Giving thanks: On Thanksgiving, a Walmart in Sugar Land, Texas is crowded with shoppers who had waited for hours inside the store for the beginning of the sales at 6pm

Dice is also frustrated that the desperate want of discounted goods means that Black Friday has encroached on Thanksgiving, forcing retail associates to work 'bizarre hours' and leave their own families on Thanksgiving.

'Attention debt slaves: Thank you for ruining the Thanksgiving of these poor workers that now have to work while you come in to spend more money you don't have on things you don't need. Thank you

'Ho, ho, ho! You’re a disgrace to Christmas,' Dice shouted at shoppers lined up outside a Target store.

'You’re teaching your children such great family values: Let’s not have the family together for dinner, let’s have everybody out to buy a bigger television and more iPads so that they don’t talk to each other. Thank you, enemies of America! Thank you, parasites on this country!'

This year, as many big retailers opened on Thanksgiving night, the shopping mania became even more frenzied, with shocking displays of violence playing out around the country.

'Mentally enslaved morons': Dice told these Sears shoppers exactly what he thought about them shopping on Thanksgiving

In a Walmart carpark in Virginia, a vicious stabbing took place, while inside a Philadelphia mall, one woman was shocked with a stun gun during a brutal punch-up.

A man was shot in Las Vegas and robbed of the big-screen television he'd just purchased in the early hours of Friday morning.

'People leaving Thanksgiving dinner to go and buy more crap - it's absolutely incredible,' Dice told Jones.

To jeers and a few cheers, Dice tells shoppers outside Sears: 'Ho ho ho! You're all parasites and debt slaves! Mentally enslaved morons!'
