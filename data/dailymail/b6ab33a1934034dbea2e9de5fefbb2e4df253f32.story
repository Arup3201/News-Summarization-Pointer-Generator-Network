The bodies of an elderly mother and daughter have been discovered close to a fire in the home they shared.

It is feared frail widow Irene Sawyer, 94, and only daughter Kathleen, 64 - who were both
pronounced dead at the scene - could have died after breathing in fumes 
as they struggled to stay warm.

The pair were discovered by police after neighbours noticed bottles of milk building up on the doorstep and raised the alarm.

Police said they are currently treating the deaths as unexplained, and forensic experts are now combing the house in Kings Heath, Birmingham.

as they struggled to stay warm

Officers and fire crews forced entry to the terraced home in Balaclava Road just before 7pm on Monday to find the pair in the living room.

Neighbours say they had taken to 
sleeping downstairs in front of the gas fire -  believed to be the only source of 
heating in the house - in a bid to keep warm. 

An inquiry is now underway to try and establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths, and to determine when either of the pair were last seen alive.

But family say wheelchair bound Mrs Sawyer, who was cared for by her unmarried daughter, was warned about a possible problem with the fire before Christmas.

Irene Sawyer's sister-in-law Hilda Goodwin, 84, said: 'We went round in December and my daughter's boyfriend said "I think you should get your gas fire looked at".

'The flames were burning white and not blue like normal so he told her to get it sorted.

'She said there was a routine service due in February so she would get it fixed then.

'The service was booked in a few days’ time. My advice to people who think there's a problem with their fire is don't let it happen to you, get it checked and don't put it off.'

Mrs Goodwin added that Irene - known as 'Reanie' to her family - had been experiencing declining health over the last 12 months.

She said: 'Irene's legs had gone so she slept downstairs in the living room and Kathleen would usually go up to bed after making sure her mum was warm and had enough blankets.

'We don't know for certain what happened but they were probably overcome by the fumes and died together.

'Kathleen doted on her mum completely, she never went out apart from to get groceries. Kathleen lived in that house all her life - 64 years.

'She only had one job her whole life, working for social security and she went about as high as she could go in that job.

'It's strange that they died as they lived - together.'

Mrs Goodwin said she and husband Gordon, 89, Irene's brother, were 'shocked' by the deaths.

Neighbour Janet Wheatley, 69, said that her daughter raised the alarm after they hadn't seen the pair for four days. 

She said: 'They kept themselves to themselves mostly, Irene had been very ill so she mostly stayed in the house. 

'You'd sometimes see Kath push her out in a wheelchair but only to go to the park or something like that. We started to get worried after my husband noticed milk bottles hadn't been collected.

'I went around there three times yesterday, I was banging away on the window, lifting the letterbox up, calling Kath's name, thinking they'd answer but they didn't.

'In the day the curtains were open but I couldn't see through the net inside. Later on I went round when it had got darker and could see that the fire was on.

'I tapped on the window at about half past five and there was still no answer. My daughter came round and called the police at about half past six.

'She explained how worried we were and they came round at about 7.30.

'By 8pm there were police cars and fire engines and ambulances outside. A couple of plain clothes police came to visit at 10.30 last night and told us there were suspicious circumstances. 

'They asked if we had seen anything suspicious around the corner but we hadn't. I was shocked when I found out, we all were.

'They were nice people, Kath was a very caring girl, a lovely person really. I used to see her leaving for work and she'd just be walking up the street looking back and waving goodbye to her mum.'I think she retired a few years ago to look after her mum full time.'

Mrs Wheatley believed that the pair had been sleeping downstairs in the living room with the gas fire on to escape the recent cold weather.

She added: 'They have been sleeping downstairs in the living room.

'Their house didn't have central heating, most of them don't around here so people sleep downstairs with the gas fire on.

'The police asked me if I knew whether they had been sleeping downstairs.

'My daughter told me to get mine checked so maybe I will now.'

Det Insp Pete Dunn, of West Midlands 
Police, said neighbours had contacted police out of concern that neither
woman had been seen for some time.

'They could see the fire was on 
through the window but weren't getting an answer at the door. The cause 
of their deaths have yet to be established and a postmortem will be 
carried out in due course.

'The women are yet to be formally identified and efforts are ongoing to trace their next of kin.

'However, we would appeal for anyone 
who knew their movements, may have seen them within the last week, or 
who saw anything suspicious in Balaclava Road to contact police on the 
101 number.'
