Success: Cardiff Sixth Form College saw 94.7 per cent of their 112 A-level pupils pass with grades A* and A

An obscure fee-paying college in South Wales has beaten top public schools such as Marlborough and Rugby to become the country’s top private school for A-levels.

Cardiff Sixth Form College has more than 330 students from 32 countries, including high-fliers from the local community who study for free.

This summer 112 pupils took A-levels, 94 of them from countries such as China, Russia and Albania, including several receiving sponsorship from their governments for the £29,700 fees for boarders.

Eighteen were home students on full academic scholarships which cover their £12,000-a-year day pupil fees, with some drawn from schools in the South Wales region.

Today the Independent Schools Council league table of 350 fee-paying schools reveals pupils at the college passed 94.7 per cent of A-levels with grades A* and A.

Almost all the remaining grades were Bs, with just one pupil handed a single C.

Yasmin Sarwar, executive director of the college, attributed the school’s success to dedicated teachers – mainly drawn from the state sector – and a tough selection process for pupils.

Entry requirements for British students are six A*s at GCSE, although most have between eight and ten A*s.

Mrs Sarwar added: ‘We have got students from all around the world who are ambitious, and we combine that with the best from Britain.

‘One thing my head girl said in her speech was that she would never in a million years have thought her best friend would be someone from Hong Kong.

‘She’s from Caerphilly. That sums up the environment.’ 

Students also have the benefit of being taught in small groups  and are encouraged to take  part in school Olympiads – international subject competitions – to stretch them beyond the A-level syllabus.

More than 100 leading schools – including Eton, Harrow and Westminster – opt out of league tables, amid claims they give parents an incomplete picture of what a school has to offer.

Even so the latest rankings reveal how independent schools, such as Marlborough in Wiltshire, the Duchess of Cambridge’s alma mater, look set to tighten their grip on prestigious universities.

The number of privately educated pupils achieving three or more A*s leapt 22 per cent on last year to 2,311, with boys more likely to achieve the feat than girls.

The highest-achieving state school which contributed to A-level league tables published last week was Queen Elizabeth’s School in Barnet, Hertfordshire, a boys’ grammar, where pupils passed 95.97 per cent of exams at grades A*, A or B.
