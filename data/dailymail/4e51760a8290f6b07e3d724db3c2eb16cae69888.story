A brave cancer sufferer who filmed herself asking Hollywood star Joseph Gordon-Levitt out on a date has become an internet sensation.

Pretty brunette Lindsey Miller, who suffers from pancreatic neuroendcrine cancer, decided to solve her dating crisis by asking the Inception star out for a coffee in a YouTube video.

Despite saying she finds it hard to explain her cancerous tumour to potential dates, the 26-year-old plucked up the courage to ask out long-term crush Joseph in a video which has become an unlikely web hit.

Request: Cancer sufferer Lindsey Miller asked out Hollywood star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, right, in a YouTube video which has received over 250,000 hits

The YouTube video, entitled 'Will Joseph Gordon-Levitt Have Coffee With Me?' of Lindsey asking out the 30-year-old star has now been viewed over 250,000 times.

Lindsey decided to ask Joseph for a date after watching his latest film '50/50', in which Gordon-Levitt plays a 27-year-old who is suddenly diagnosed with cancer.

The story is based on the personal struggles with the disease by the movie's writer Will Reiser.

In the 38-second video, she says: 'I think I identify with your character more than most people because I'm 26 and I have cancer.

Empathy: Lindsey Miller said she could identify with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'cancer comedy' '50/50', where he plays a man diagnosed with the disease

'Even though I look healthy, dating has been a little difficult because I'm not sure how to explain what I have been going through.

'But after a year of living with this I have decided to get back on the dating scene, and I would like my first date to be with you.

'Maybe you can call it my 'make a wish', but let's not be over dramatic.

'Just a cup of coffee with you would make me happy.'

Lindsey was diagnosed with cancer last year, she had surgery in December 2010 to remove half of her pancreas and liver, her spleen and gallbladder and she is currently on an oral chemotherapy medication.

Lindsey said of the video: 'After seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance and seeing and reading some of his subsequent interviews about the film I thought 'this guy gets it'.

'And I thought 'he's cute, I wonder if I could ever run into him somewhere'. But even though I live in LA, it seemed impossible to find him.'

Best-known: The 30-year-old actor is widely recognised for his role alongside Leonardo Di Caprio in Inception

Star factor: Another of Gordon-Levitt's big parts saw him in the leading role alongside Zooey Deschanel in '500 Days of Summer'

'For most of the past year I have been selectively telling people about my diagnosis.

'In August, I started this blog, so a few more people found out. This weekend, I 'came out' as a cancer liver on Facebook and I got tons (sic) of well wishes from old friends and acquaintances alike.

'One thing I really miss about being healthy is that I always had the freedom to do what I wanted without really having to plan ahead.

'Life is short. So I thought, 'why not?''

Despite the video being viewed over 257,000 times and Lindsey receiving widespread support on Twitter, there was no indication as yet of a response from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
