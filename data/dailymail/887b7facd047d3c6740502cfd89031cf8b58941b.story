One of the world’s most renowned auction houses will allow collectors to purchase art masterpieces and jewellery via ebay.

The art experts and internet giant are working together to create a web platform, but Hockney's won’t be sold alongside any old household items.

The aim of the partnership is to make it easier for millions of people worldwide to view and buy works of art, antiques and collectibles online.

Online bidders competed for 17 per cent of the total lots offered in 2013.

John James Audubon’s elephant-folio The Birds of America sold in April 2014 for $3.5million (£2million) - marking a new record for an online purchase in a live auction at Sotheby’s.

The number of lots purchased online in 2013 increased 36 per cent versus 2012.

More than half of all lots sold were in the $5,000-$100,000 (£2,900-£58,300) range in 2013.

Around a third of all BIDnow bidders had never bought from Sotheby’s prior to 2013.

The number of visitors to sothebys.com on mobile devices doubled in 2013 versus 2012.

Mobile traffic in 2014 accounts for a quarter of total Sotheby’s website traffic.

Bruno Vinciguerra, CEO of Sotheby’s said that the auction house wants to reach ‘the broadest possible audience around the world'.

As technology evolves and mobile commerce becomes ubiquitous, collectors are increasingly purchasing high-end items online and even on-the-go from their mobile devices.

Online bidders competed for 17 per cent of the total lots offered in 2013 and this figure is rising.

In 2013 alone, the number of artworks bought online increased by 36 per cent and online art sales are expected to reach $13billion (£8billion) by the end of the decade.

The platform will first be in action for live auctions streamed from Sotheby’s New York rooms, to allow ‘real-time bidding from anywhere in the world’.

Bidders will be able to buy online from 18 categories to start with – including jewellery, photographs, wine and watches, which Sotheby’s said are popular online.

No launch date for the service has yet been revealed, but the auction house said that it will be rolled out for themed sales and live auctions from other sales rooms across the world in due course.

‘The growth of the art market, new generation technology and our shared strengths make this the right time for this exciting new online opportunity, Mr Vinciguerra said.

Devin Wenig, president of eBay Marketplaces, said that the partnership marks ‘a significant milestone in our efforts to expand the live auction market’.
