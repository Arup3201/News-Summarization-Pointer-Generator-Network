Paul Ryan hopes to deliver a knockout blow to President Barack Obama's hopes of re-election if he prevails in tonight's debate in Kentucky.

While the Romney campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of Representative Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate, privately hopes are high that he could do very well.

And if the pictures in the next edition of TIME magazine of the vice-presidential candidate working out in December 2011 are anything to go by, he's pumped up for the 'Thrill in the Ville', in Danville.

Biden, who was a Senator for 36 years, is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the Romney campaign - most particularly when he said Republicans wanted to 'put y'all back in chains' and when he said the middle class had been 'buried' under Obama.

Ryan, just 42, is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation, a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered Congress in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then Biden was when he became a Senator in 1972.

Feeling good: Republicans are more confident than Democrats going into the vice presidential debate

A new Pew Research Centre poll has found that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 Republican vice- presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

By a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin, voters expect Ryan to beat Biden at their Thursday debate in Danville, Kentucky. Among independents, 42 to 25 per cent believe Ryan will win.

This could create an expectations problem
for Ryan - much as was the case for Obama, who was heavily favoured by 
voters before he was trounced by Romney in the first presidential debate
in Denver.

At the weekend, Ryan said of Biden: 
'He's fast on the cuff, he's a witty guy. He knows who he is and he's 
been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden.'

Betting big: Expectations are high among voters that Ryan, 42, will win the debate against Biden, 69, even though Ryan has far less debate experience than the vice president

Hedging expectations: Trying to tamp down expectations that he will beat Biden in the debate, Ryan said of his opponent, 'He's been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden'

Romney tried to damp down Ryan's 
experience, telling CNN: 'I don’t know how Paul will take on the debate.
Obviously the Vice President has done 15-20 debates in his lifetime—he 
is an experienced debater—I think this is Paul’s first debate. I may be 
wrong, he may have done something in high school, we don’t know.

'But,
it will be a new experience for Paul, but I am sure he will do fine. 
Frankly, he has policy, facts, and results on his side. So I think you 
find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so 
much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter, but the policies 
and pathways being described.'

Popularity contest: A new Pew Research poll has found 
that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan

Hoping for the best: Romney is also trying to tamp down expectations of Paul's debate performance, saying, 'I think this is Paul’s first debate. I may be 
wrong, he may have done something in high school, we don’t know'

Charmer: Ryan is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation

In fact, according to ABC News, Ryan has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in Congress - though none of them anything like as high-profile as Thursday's clash, which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched Romney and Obama in Denver.

According to Pew, Biden, whose role in the campaign is as attack dog and as the man who can connect with blue-collar voters, is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters. Four years ago, when he faced Palin, his favourability rating was 53 per cent.

Romney has leapt to level pegging - or 
even into the lead - in national polls since his much-praised debate 
performance in Denver. While Obama still holds slim leads in 
battleground states, his campaign badly needs to alter the trajectory of
the race.

Biden has the opportunity to do that but 
traditionally vice-presidential debate, while they have provided 
entertainment and some big moments, have not had an appreciable effect 
on the general election result.

Losing ground: Biden is 
viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters compared to four years ago, when he
faced Palin and his favourability rating was 53 per cent

In 1988, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas delivered one of the most famous put-downs in political history. When Senator Dan Quayle, then Vice-President George H.W. Bush's running mate, said he had nearly as much congressional experience as John F. Kennedy, Bentsen pounced.

He said: 'Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy: I knew Jack Kennedy; Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. … Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.' Quayle responded lamely that this was 'really uncalled for' and his political career arguably never recovered

But in the November election, the Bush-Quayle Republican ticket was victorious over Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Bentsen, the Democratic ticket.
