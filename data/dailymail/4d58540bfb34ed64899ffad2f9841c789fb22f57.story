Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made an honorary knight by the Queen.

The 72-year-old businessman and politician's new title will be Michael Bloomberg, Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE).

It comes just weeks after David Cameron was roundly criticised for breaking protocol by recounting a conversation he'd had with the Queen while chatting to the former Mayor of New York.

The Prime Minister was overheard by a TV crew's microphone telling Mr Bloomberg that the Queen had 'purred' down the line when he informed her last month that Scotland had rejected independence.  

Sir Michael (sort of) : Businessman and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made a Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire

Billionaire Mr Bloomberg, who owns a £12million home in London's upmarket Knightsbridge and today said Britain was his 'second home', will not be travelling to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, but said he was 'deeply honoured' by the award.

He has been given the honorary knighthood for his 'prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavours, and the many ways in which they have benefited the United Kingdom and the UK-US special relationship', the British Embassy in Washington said in a statement.

But the timing of the award may be regarded as somewhat unfortunate with Mr Cameron's gaffe still fresh in the memory.

On a visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Cameron was overheard to tell Mr Bloomberg: 'She purred down the line. I've never heard someone so happy.'

Embarrassed Mr Cameron apologised for the incident and his aides in Number 10 have been in touch with Buckingham Palace.

But he has yet to apologise in person, and is expected to say sorry to the Queen at their next formal audience.

Mr Bloomberg, a self-confessed anglophile, has committed £42.4m in philanthropic support to the UK

As a foreign national Mr Bloomberg will be made an honorary knight, and will therefore not be Sir Michael Bloomberg, but can, if he wishes, add KBE to the end of his name.

Non-British nationals can receive honorary awards awards for their important contribution to British interests. 

'As Mayor of New York, as a businessman, and as a philanthropist, Mike Bloomberg has played a key role in forging transatlantic diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties,' British Ambassador to the United States Sir Peter Westmacott said today.

'He has made a significant contribution to British business life through his firm, Bloomberg L.P., and the impact of his considerable philanthropic endeavours in the arts and education is felt by Britons every day.'

Upon accepting the title, Mr Bloomberg said: 'I am deeply honoured to receive this recognition, which is especially meaningful to me because of my close personal, business, and philanthropic ties to London and Britain, which stretch back four decades. 

'Over those years it has been a great privilege to work with British leaders on a wide variety of issues, and to invest - commercially, culturally, and civically - in the future of Britain, a place I have long considered my second home.' 

As Mayor of New York, Mr Bloomberg got on famously well with London Mayor Boris Johnson the pair worked together to boost travel between the UK capital and NYC.

Mr Bloomberg, a self-confessed anglophile, is a 'great supporter of the arts and education in Britain' and has committed more than £42.4million in philanthropic support to the UK.

Other American citizens who have been made honorary knights include Steven Spielberg, George Bush Sr and Ronald Reagan.
