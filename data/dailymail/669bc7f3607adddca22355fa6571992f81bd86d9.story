Juventus are ready to resist big offers from top European clubs for midfielder Paul Pogba this summer.

The Turin giants have no interest in selling the France international, who has been a big hit since arriving at Juve in 2012 after leaving Manchester United as a free agent.

'There are clubs that are ready to spend 70 to 80 million euros for Pogba,' Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta told Italian radio station Radio Deejay.

'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us.

'If we want to increase our level, we need players of great quality and Pogba is one of them.'

The 22-year-old midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain at the end of the season while Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid are also reportedly keen to acquire his services.

Pogba has scored seven goals and set up two more in 22 league appearances to help Juve remain on course for their fourth successive scudetto.

The Frenchman is under contract with the Turin giants until June 2019.

Marotta did reveal that Juve are keeping a close eye on Palermo's Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala.

Dybala, 21, has been impressive this season for the Sicilian outfit, scoring 12 goals while providing seven assists in 27 league games.

'Dybala is a very interesting youngster, who not only has attracted our attention but (that) of other teams too,' Marotta said. 'We are looking to see what is out there in order to form a strong attacking line.'

Dybala moved to Palermo in 2012 from home-town club Instituto and helped them gain promotion to Italy's top flight in the 2013-14 campaign.

The South American turned down a contract extension earlier this year and becomes a free agent in June 2016.
