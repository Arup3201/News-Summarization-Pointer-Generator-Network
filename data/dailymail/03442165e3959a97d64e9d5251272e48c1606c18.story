Managers:

Jose Pekerman (Colombia)Fernando Santos (Greece)

Key clash: Juan Cuadrado v Jose Holebas

Cuadrado, heavily linked with a move to Barcelona this summer, has the potential to be one of the tournament’s stars. Blessed with electric pace and a powerful shot, the Fiorentina winger will find all sorts of space against Greece’s attacking left-back Holebas.

Doing battle: Colombia's Juan Cuadrado (left) and Greece's Jose Holebas will be dueling on Saturday

One to watch: James Rodriguez (Colombia)

Shorn of their main striker after Radamel Falcao failed to recover from a cruciate ligament injury in time to be part of the squad, Colombia will need Rodriguez more than ever. The Monaco man emerged as one of his country’s most important players in qualifying, as his dynamic play in attacking areas caused mayhem for their opponents.

Talent: Colombia's midfielder James Rodriguez (centre) will be one to watch during the World Cup
