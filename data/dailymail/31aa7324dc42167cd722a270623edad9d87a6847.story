A seven-year-old boy has died and his father left in a serious condition after they were found unconscious in their flooded home.

The child – named by neighbours as Zane Gbangbola – and his father, Kye Gbangbola, 48, were discovered during a rescue in Chertsey, Surrey, yesterday.

It is understood that Zane’s mother, identified as Nicole Lawler, 36, was also taken to the nearby St Peter’s Hospital, but did not require treatment.

Tragic: The child - named by neighbours as Zane Gbangbola - was 
discovered during a night-time rescue

Police are investigating the cause of death. The boy's father remains 
in a critical condition in St Peter's Hospital, Surrey

The boy's father Kye Gbangbola, 48, remains in a critical condition. The boy's mother was also checked over by hospital staff but did not need treatment

A further 15 people, including a number of police officers, also underwent medical checks after complaining
 of feeling unwell.

Officers appealed to anyone in the area showing ‘signs of 
vomiting, diarrhoea and fever’ to seek immediate help.

Wale Gbangbola, Kye's brother, said last night: 'Zane was a very intelligent boy who was cheerful and energetic.'

Local resident Anoop Hothi said he found out about the tragedy through his neighbours.

‘I’ve been in shock all day about little Zane,’ he said. ‘He was a lovely little boy, a really good boy, a delightful person.’

Zane
 was a pupil at St George’s Junior School in Weybridge, Surrey.

Headteacher Antony Hudson has emailed parents asking them to explain to 
their children what had happened to the youngster, a keen taekwondo student, and to ‘keep him in your prayers’.

Elizabeth Anionwu, the co-founder of 
the Sickle Cell society, of which Mr Gbangola was chairman told The 
Sunday Times: 'He is a wonderful family man and a wonderful father.'

Mr Gbangold runs an eco-management consultancy firm called Total Eco Management, with his partner Miss Lawler.

They
 had a contract during the London 2012 Olympics as the 'sustainability 
reporting supplier' for Locog, the game's organisers.

Miss Lawler is a member of the All Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group advising MPs on the issue.

On
 January 11, she posted a photo of the rising flood waters outside her 
home on Twitter and wrote: 'So I've been told to expect the Thames 
#floods to rise another 6" over the next 24 hours. This is outside my 
front door!'

The schoolboy’s death in Chertsey came after the nearby River Thames burst its banks on Friday night.

A 
police guard remained outside the property in the Thameside area and 
local roads were closed.

Chief
 Superintendent Dave Miller said: ‘It is very sad that a young child has
 died earlier today. Our thoughts are with his parents.

'Police officers are currently with them and we will continue to offer our support during this difficult time .

'Our aim is to keep people safe and find out the cause.

'I would like to reassure local residents our officers are working closely with partner agencies and a full and thorough investigation is currently under way to determine the circumstances around this tragic incident.

'We are currently following various lines of inquiry and it would be wrong to speculate on the cause of death at this stage.

'The cause of the illness is currently unknown but what I can confirm is that the people who were taken ill are from a very localised area.

‘We
 cannot rule out a link to flooding in the area and while the 
investigation is ongoing, local residents should follow sensible 
precautions.’

The
 tragedy came as the Met Office described the storms of the past few 
weeks as the worst in 248 years.

On another day of flooding 
misery the South-West was yesterday lashed by 80mph gales, with 
the coast suffering yet another battering and waves of up to 45ft 
recorded out at sea.

Distraught families continued to flee their flood-ravaged homes in Somerset and Devon.

An elderly woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries after a tree fell onto a car in Yardley, Birmingham.

The Met Office said the UK was in the midst of its 
worst winter since 1766 – and forecast more heavy rain.

A spokesman said: ‘This is one of the most exceptional periods of winter weather in 248 years – it is a scary statistic.’

David
 Cameron is due to chair an emergency Cobra meeting of senior ministers 
today. Last night almost 2,000 troops were on standby across the South 
of England.

The wild weather
 continued to batter the West Country, with coastguards warning of 
‘phenomenal’ 45ft waves off the South Coast. Jo Smith, of Brixham 
coastguardsin Devon, said: ‘These are some of the highest seas in living
 memory.’

Police have urged anyone in the local area suffering vomiting, diarrhoea and a fever to seek medical attention

An RAF Sea King 
helicopter was scrambled to rescue two surfers who had ignored warnings 
and had to be winched clear from the raging seas at Lynmouth Bay in 
North Devon.

Meanwhile, in Lewes, East Sussex, firefighters waded in to 
save a father and his two children who were trapped in a car which broke
 down in 4ft of floodwater.

Mike Rentz, 54, son Felix, 11, and 
eight-year-old daughter Florence were hauled clear by rescuers who waded
 through waist-deep water to get them out.

Mr
 Rentz, from the nearby village of Little Horsted, said: ‘It all 
happened really quickly. The road had been clear the day before and 
there was no warning of flooding. I climbed out on to the roof, got the 
children out and called for help.’

In
 Dorset, the Army was called in to build makeshift defences to protect 
Chesil Beach, a World Heritage site. Bulldozers and diggers were used to
 carry out the work.

Meanwhile, families continued to move out of their homes to escape the rising waters in Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Kent and Berkshire.

Even
 the defences around builder Sam Notaro’s home in the Somerset village 
of Moorland, which have kept his property flood-free for weeks, were 
starting to fail.

In 
Dawlish, Devon, properties were on the verge of collapsing into the sea 
after the sea wall was smashed in the storms during the week, leaving a 
railway line dangling in mid-air.

Resident
 Shane Manning said he had managed to retrieve some possessions from his
 badly-damaged home but added: ‘We will just have to wait to see what 
happens.’

Thames Water warned people not to flush their toilets in 
Hurst, Berkshire, because of flooded sewerage systems. Resident Paul 
Palmer said: ‘If we flush the toilet it comes back up into the gardens.’

A Thames Water spokesman said it was a problem affecting large swathes of the country.
