For children born 
with a rare genetic condition that makes their skin so delicate it can 
break into agonizing blisters at even the slightest tough, every day is a
 constant struggle with suffering few can understand, both physical and 
social.

Courtney Roth's son Tripp was born in 2009 with only a small blister on his head. She later learned he suffered from Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex or 'Butterfly Disease,' so named because the skin is as fragile as an insect's wing,

Roth, 27, chronicled her struggles in a blog, as she cared for a newborn doctors told her would not be long for this world.

Courtney Roth struggled to keep her newborn son Tripp healthy as he suffered from the debilitating effects of the 'butterfly' condition

Despite constantly suffering damage to both his skin and organs, Tripp survived for two years and eight months

Parents say the condition forces children to endure more suffering in one day than most people do in a lifetime

Even Tripp's internal organs blistered, making malnutrition and loss of fluid and infection common.

Mothering
 him was a case of trial and error, because every wound would be 
different and there was no way to tell how fast they would heal, if in 
fact they healed at all.

Still, Tripp survived longer than doctors expected, dying only four months shy of his third birthday in 2012.

'These moms and these parents, they're yearning for somebody that's 
going through the same situation,' she said. 'It's probably one of the 
cruelest, hardest things to have to go through, to watch your child 
suffer like that knowing you can't do anything about it.'

Tripp's mother started a blog about his care and discovered a community of parents online starved for information

A new procedure that produces needed proteins through a bone marrow transplant could lead to a cure for those suffering from the condition

Megan Barron, 22, has 
lived her entire life with a severe form of the condition that's left 
her hands permanently scarred into fists except for her thumbs, which 
were surgically freed so that she could perform basic tasks.

She
 still made it to college, and will graduate this May with a White House
 internship on her resume along with her major in history and minor in 
political science.

In her 
sophomore year, she started the Duke Disability Alliance, an advocacy 
group to raise awareness and accessibility for disabled students on 
campus.

Though new treatments are being developed, four people who've undergone transplants have died

An estimated 25,000 to 50,000 people have epidermolysis bullosa in the United States alone

'It's 
literally the worst disease you've never heard of,' said her father, 
Brett Kopelan, who runs the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research 
Association of America. 'The simplest of things, like dental cleaning or
 brushing her teeth, is enough to rip the inside of her mouth open. Yet 
this kid gets up and goes to school every day with a smile on her face. I
 don't know how she does it. I don't know how any of these kids do it.'

Typing
 an e-mail with her thumbs, as she taught herself in the third grade, 
Barron wrote: 'My heart sinks for these kids. So many times I fear 
revealing too much of my skin and bandages...I fear this very reaction 
if someone sees too much.'

Borron said people get 'freaked out' by her open sores and she often 
thinks of herself as a leper. Only by the time she reached college had 
she learned to ignore the stares and be herself regardless of 
surroundings.

Butterfly disease: Lizzy Hendrickson suffers with the painful condition dubbed 'butterfly disease' because her skin is so weak and tears at the slightest graze

Her real friends, she said, accepted her feeding tube and the full-time nurse by her side without making her self-conscious.

Scientists have hope that they can someday find a way to replace the missing protein.

In
 2007, University fo Minnesota cancer researchers Dr. John Wagner and 
Dr. Jakub Tolar began clinical trials to transplant stem cells in bone 
marrow they believed could produce the missing protein. They've since 
done two dozen transplants, and their first patient is still alive.

'You could actually see the skin repairing by just looking at the kid,' Wagner told ABC News.

To
 test the results, Tolar attempts to blister a patient's arm with a 
negative vacuum device. A normal patient would take an hour to blister 
while a person suffering from the 'butterfly' condition would see 
blisters in just minutes.

After
 Rafi underwent a bone marrow transplant, it took her skin more than 20 
minutes to blister. It's a significant improvement but not a cure. 

But
 the surgery remains controversial after other doctors called him a 
'witch doctor' because bone marrow had no history of affecting skin, 
Wagner said. And four patients who underwent a cord blood transplant 
after a bone marrow match could not be found died after the transplant.

Lizzy Hendrickson, a little girl from Phoenix, Arizona, has also recently been diagnosed with the disease, 12 News Phoenix reports.

She can't do simple tasks 
without putting herself at risk and to run, play and fall like other 
children would likely necessitate a trip to the emergency room.

She
 can't be showered because of the pressure of falling water and wears 
layers of ointment and bandages around her legs - the worst affected 
parts of her body.

Changing her out of her diapers as a baby was a two person job - her parents told the website.

One
 had to focus on holding her down and stopping her from wriggling so she
 didn't break her skin from the movement while the other removed the 
diaper gently with two hands to ensure it didn't tear her by sticking to
 her body.

'There’s nothing that I can do, as a mother, to make her pain go away,' Kristin Hendrickson told the local website.

'You
 just hope that it ends quickly. But that kind of makes me feel like a 
failure as a mother, that I have this child that is in pain or gets hurt
 and I can’t protect her.'

'It’s a horrible feeling as a parent. You feel totally out of control.'

The
 incurable disease affects around 1 in 50,000 and can vary in severity 
with most cases at the very mild end of the scale, a much less serious 
illness than Lizzy's.

painful blisters on her body from her condition, particularly on her 
legs, pictured. They have to be constantly bandaged to protect them from
 every touch

On the other end some children 
are unable to eat solid food as their throats and tongues are affected 
with food tearing at their bodies from the inside.

Lizzy is able to wear normal clothes but anything sharp like a zipper is strictly banned.

Her arms can go un-bandaged but are still sensitive and she often gets blisters on her face.

Her parents use ice packs to relieve the pain but are daily forced to pop large blisters that form across her body.

Her mother, Kristin, 40, a nurse said the diagnosis was heartbreaking.

'I
 can’t possibly describe how I felt at the time,' she told the website. 
'I thought my child had a death sentence. It was unthinkable to me. It 
was unbearable.'

Her father Rob, a teacher, 49, recalls looking up the disease when she was first diagnosed.

'Boy, was that a mistake,' he said.

The couple have developed a close relationship with their specialist Dr Ronald Hansen.

The
 head of dermatology at Phoenix Children’s Hospital discovered her 
condition by simply rubbing his pencil eraser on the remaining skin on 
her leg - soon it was tearing

'We
 had a number of very interesting conversations with Dr. Hansen very 
early on,' Rob said. 'What do we do with her? Do we put her in a bubble?
 Keep her safe? Or do we make her a normal kid and deal with the 
consequences'.

The family 
were able to count their small blessings that their little girl wasn't 
suffering from one of the very extreme types of the disease. Her eating 
isn't affected so she can go to school so long as she, and everyone 
around her, is extremely careful.

Building a normal life: Things are getting easier for Lizzy as she and the people around her learn to live with her condition

Although she can't get into the rough and tumble of the playground her parents want her to have as normal a life as possible.

'I didn’t want to mummy her, keep her like a mummy,' Kristin said.

And
 the gift of independence is helping. Lizzy now changes her own 
dressings and when asked about her condition in school has been known to
 reply - 'I'm beautiful'.

'She’s very much a little captain. She’s in charge. She’s a very savvy little girl,' Dr Hansen says.

'But
 we kind of always tell (EB) parents, like, this should be their 
computer kid. She can’t be the soccer kid, because she just can’t stand 
any kind of friction. It causes blisters every time she touches 
anything.'

'Having said that, Lizzy will go off and kick a soccer ball.

'She’s going to be a rambunctious, active girl. But she pays for it. Every time. She pays for it with blisters.'

The couple, meanwhile, fund-raise to try and help advance research into the disease and hopefully find a cure.

'Will
 it be five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now? We 
don’t know,' Rob said. 'We know a cure is coming. We feel that in our 
hearts.'
