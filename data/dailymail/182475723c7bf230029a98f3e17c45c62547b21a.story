Prosecutors Friday 
were waiting for the results of a police investigation into the killing 
of a burglar by an 80-year-old California homeowner who says he shot the
 woman in the back as she fled his home and ran down an alley, the 
district attorney's office said.

Long Beach 
resident Tom Greer, 80, told KNBC-TV that the burglar had said she was 
pregnant and asked Greer not to fire, but he shot her twice in the back 
anyway.

An autopsy later found that Andrea Miller, 28, was not pregnant, said coroner's spokesman Ed Winter.

Attack: Tom Greer said he shot a woman breaking into his home despite her claiming she was pregnant, but recent reports reveal she was not expecting a child

Gus Adams has already been charged in the death of Andrea Miller, who was breaking into Greer's home with him when the elderly resident caught the couple, resulting in Miller's death

'Long
 Beach police are still investigating,' said Sarah Ardalani, spokeswoman
 for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 'It's ongoing, 
and so we're waiting at this point.'

Prosecutors
 filed murder, burglary, robbery and weapons charges against Gus Adams, 
26, a suspected accomplice of Miller.

He was being held on bail of more 
than $1 million.

A court appearance initially set for Friday was rescheduled for next month.

The
 murder charge is possible because Adams is accused of participating in a
 felony that led to a death, said Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell.

Police
 said Friday that Adams' mother, Ruby Adams, also was involved, and she 
was arrested Thursday night on suspicion of robbery.

They gave no 
details on her alleged role or the evidence against her.

McDonnell
 said the homeowner came home around 9 p.m. Tuesday and surprised Adams 
and Miller, who were trying to break into a safe.

They assaulted him, 
breaking his collarbone, before he was able to get a handgun, the chief 
said.

Police said he fired shots inside and outside his house.

He reportedly told KNBC on Wednesday: '[Miller] says, "Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm going to have a baby,' andÂ  I shot her anyway.'

Greer told NBC 4 he believes he was acting in self defense.

He said when
 the pair saw he was armed, they allegedly ran out of the house, but 
Greer told the TV station that he fired on them, hitting the woman.

He
 allegedly added he had no regrets about the shooting, telling KNBC: 
'When the time comes to defend yourself, you best do something.'

Under
 California law, homeowners have a right to protect themselves with 
deadly force inside their homes and in the immediate vicinity - such as a
 patio - if they feel they are in imminent danger of great bodily injury
 or death, said Lawrence Rosenthal, a former federal prosecutor who 
teaches law at Chapman University.

But this 
case enters a gray area because Greer, by his own account, chased the 
burglars and fired at them outside his home as they were fleeing, 
Rosenthal said.

'The problem here is that all 
this happens very fast and his legal right to use force probably ended 
just a few seconds before he did use deadly force,' Rosenthal said. 'So 
the question is should you charge somebody on the basis of what really 
was a series of split-second decisions when he's just been robbed and 
physically assaulted?'

McDonnell declined to say how many shots were fired or to confirm that Miller was shot in the back.

No phone listing was available for Greer and he could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press.
