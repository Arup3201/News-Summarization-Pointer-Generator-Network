Forecasters say spring is just around the corner, and it can’t come soon enough for this little fellow.

The lamb was born in Downderry, Cornwall, where shepherd Arthur Phillips, 58, has been working round the clock to make sure that his new arrivals survive the chilly weather.

The Met Office’s Calum MacColl said: ‘By the end of the week, temperatures will start to get back to more like normal for this time of year. They should return to about seven or eight degrees Celsius (44F - 46F).’

Blooms: 100,000 snowdrops at Wakehurst Place – a National Trust estate in West Sussex – offers further hope that spring isn’t far away, while camellias (pictured) are making an early appearance in Cornwall

A stunning white carpet of 100,000 snowdrops at Wakehurst Place – a National Trust estate in West Sussex – offers further hope that spring isn’t far away, while camellias are making an early appearance in Cornwall.

Elsewhere, the current cold snap has delivered an exceptionally generous dump of snow on Mam Tor, a craggy old Bronze Age hill fort in the heart of the Peak District.

At 1,700 ft above sea level, it is little more than a mound by Scottish standards and a mere pimple in the Alpine scheme of things. 

But it is famous for its panoramic views and for the unstable shale which frequently comes cascading down a fearsome gully on its southern side, so much so that the road which used to run beneath it eventually had to be abandoned.

This week, an intrepid band of local mountaineers noticed that the gully was covered in more snow than anyone could remember. So they decided to ski it.

And this week, it was declared the most desirable ski resort in Europe.
