This man's facial hair will leave you lost for words.

New York designer Mike Allen has grown the entire alphabet - on his face. His incredible beard has all the letters of the alphabet plus a full stop and a comma.

The only thing missing is a mous-dash.

After carefully sculpting each letter he would have to shave it off and wait two weeks before attempting the next

Mr Allen took on the challenge to grow an 'alphabeard' after a dare from friends and has finally completed the letters after two years.

After carefully sculpting each letter he would have to shave it off and wait two weeks before attempting the next.

Mr Allen, who works for a Big Apple branding agency, said: 'I've been amused 
by the huge beard trend in the last couple years and by interesting and 
irregular facial hair styles.

'The idea for Alphabeard came from a joking conversation among friends until I started thinking of it as a real design problem.

The full A to Z: Here's Mr Allen's beardy alphabet in full

'I quickly sketched the ways I could 
make letterforms with the limitations of beard growth, including the 
bald patches, the gap around the mouth and amateur grooming skills.

'I wanted to have a consistent photograph for each letter, so I decided that profile shots and other angles were off limits.

'The first letter I tried was the upper-case A. I found it so amusing, I had to try another on my next shave.

'A
 few weeks letter, I carved in stages the O, C, and L from a single 
beard. Each time I shaved, I'd have to wait a few weeks before I could 
shave the next one.

'Some
 people have given me way too much credit for the time and dedication it
 took to complete it, but really it just added a few minutes to my 
regular shaving routine.

'I 
would occasionally ask my six-year old son if he could recognise the 
letter I had created, or ask my wife if she'd like me to wear that 
letter for the day.

'I 
continued until the end of 2013 when I finally crafted the last letter, 
the elusive K. With some regret I must say I did not walk around in 
public wearing the Alphabeard letters.

'This project began back in 2011 and I finally completed the 26 character alphabet at the end of 2013.'
