Buenos Aires rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate were treated to a spectacular entrance to their feisty Copa Sudamericana semi-final fist-leg on Thursday night.

The boisterous La Bombonera crowd filled the sky with fireworks and created a wave of firecrackers as both sets of players received an inspiring reception.

The players were clearly swept up by the electric atmosphere but sadly the game didn’t match the build-up as the bitter rivals played out a 0-0 draw.

The River Plate versus Boca Juniors SuperClasico is arguably one of the fiercest rivalry in world football.

As a result nine yellow cards were handed out as tempers persistently threatened to boil over but neither side could find a winner with the return leg at River Plate’s El Monumental scheduled for next week.

The winner will face either Brazilian side Sao Paulo or Colombian side Atletico Nacional in the final. Atletico won the first leg 1-0 on Wednesday night in front of their own fans.

The Copa Sudamericana is South America’s secondary international club football competition with the winner qualifying for the prestigious Copa Libertadores next year.
