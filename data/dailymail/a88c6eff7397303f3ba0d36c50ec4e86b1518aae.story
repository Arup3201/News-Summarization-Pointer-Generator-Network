We missed him: Analysis of Neanderthal bones using new carbon dating techniques shows they could never have coexisted with humans

Neanderthals and the ancestors of modern humans never co-existed, according to a new study which, if correct, could rewrite conventional accounts of our species early history.

The study suggests that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in Spain much earlier than previously thought.

Previous dating of bone fossils found at Neanderthal sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years.

Now researchers from Australia and Europe have re-examined the bones using an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the remains are actually about 15,000 years older.

If true, the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia.

Humans aren't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago, but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around 50,000 years ago.

'The results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the dating of the last Neanderthals in modern-day Spain,' said Thomas Higham, deputy director of the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at Oxford University.

'It is unlikely that Neanderthals survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland Europe.'

The study, which was published today by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, does not completely exclude the possibility that Neanderthals survived until 35,000 years ago.

The problem is that the warm climate on the Iberian peninsula quickly degrades a key protein used in so-called radiocarbon dating.

The researchers were only able to test bones from two of the 11 known Neanderthal sites in Spain.

They were subjected to a new method called 'ultrafiltration.' This removes more recent carbon molecules that have contaminated the bones and made them appear younger than they actually are.

Much older: The study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia

Humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around Beijing were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern Europeans, DNA analysis has found.

An international team of researchers sequenced DNA that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave near to the Chinese capital.

Analyses showed that the Tianyuan human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient Europeans.

The researchers also found that the proportion of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region.

Researchers with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the Tianyuan Cave in 2003.

Study leader Svante Pääbo said: 'This individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans, who shared certain features with earlier forms such as Neanderthals, were replacing Neanderthals and Denisovans.'

Such techniques often lead to older 
radiocarbon dates, said Chris Stringer, a senior research fellow at 
Britain's Natural History Museum. 'Science moves on and technology moves
on,' he said.

Mr Stringer, who was not involved in the study, said the new techniques should now be applied to other sites in Spain.

'Until this is done, there must be a significant question mark over the possible late survival of Neanderthals in the region.'

If the remains from the other sites, too, turn out to be older, any encounter between Neanderthals and humans would have to have taken place earlier than previously thought, he said.

'Evidence from Britain, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy is increasingly pointing to a modern human presence before 40,000 years ago,' said Mr Stringer.

'The new chronology suggests that any interaction between the last Neanderthals and the earliest moderns in Europe will similarly move before, rather than after, 40,000 years.'

There is also the chance that Neanderthals survived longer in other corners of Europe, said Rachel E. Wood of the Australian National University in Canberra, a co-author of the study.

'There are some other possible areas that may have also acted as a refuge for the species, such as the Caucasus, but the "young" radiocarbon dates in these areas have also found to be problematic,' she said.
