Floyd Mayweather Jnr is never far away from the cameras and he was snapped once more on Monday as he took in an NBA match with some celebrity friends.

The undefeated boxer watched the Los Angeles Clippers claim a 107-101 victory over the Utah Jazz with rappers YG and LL Cool J.

Having shared a laugh and a joke with his musical friends, the 37-year-old then spent time talking to Clippers star Chris Paul - presumably about the point guard's stellar performance.

Paul had enjoyed a wonderful night at the Staples Centre in LA, claiming his first triple-double for the Clippers by finishing with 13 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds.

Mayweather has not fought since winning his 47th consecutive fight in September, when he defeated Marcos Maidana for the second time this year.

The undefeated American is not scheduled to fight again until May 2015 but there are a whole raft of stellar names who he could come up against.

British boxer Amir Khan is one, but the superfight most fans would like to see is a match-up with Manny Pacquiao.
