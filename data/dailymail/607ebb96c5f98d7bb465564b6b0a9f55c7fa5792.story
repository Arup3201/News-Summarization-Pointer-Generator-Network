These bizarre forms look as if they were delicately sculpted by hand - but in fact, they are the work of blustery winds across the Midwest.

'Snow rollers' have started sweeping into yards and fields throughout Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania thanks to the right balance of light snow, firm winds and cold temperatures.

The strange sculptures have since become a hit on Twitter and Facebook as residents across the country have shared photographs of the wispy forms and the fields where they've found them.

They are usually not tightly-packed enough to be picked up, but some images on Twitter show people have succeeded in taking them inside, in a bid to preserve their shapes.

Phenomenon: Beth Schmader and her dog, Porsche, deviate from their normal morning walk through the woods to check out the field of snow rollers across the road from her home in Oil City. The funny forms have also been seen in Ohio and Illinois

According to the National Weather Service, they are formed during the right combination of sticky snow, fairly strong winds and cold temperatures. The wind will blow a small chunk of ice along the ground, leaving it to collect more snow, layer by layer.

While wind helps to form some of the rollers, others are formed by rolling down hill.

Pictures shared on social media reveal tracks left behind the snow rollers after the came to a stop.

'We had temps near freezing when the snow began - perhaps even a little ice formed on the top at the surface to not allow for the snow to stick and to allow it to roll,' meteorologist Jason Nicholas told NewsNet5 in Cleveland. 'Then the winds picked up basically rolling the snow like a snow ball.'

Janice Ford, from Lexington, Ohio, said there were snow rollers in her back yard and in a neighboring field.

'Some are the size of basketballs,' she told the Mansfield News Journal. 'It looks like there were little elves out here throwing snowballs because there are so many.'

The last time snow rollers were reported in western Pennsylvania was about 10 years ago, but they appeared in near Spokane, Washington in 2009, LiveScience reported.

The snow rollers come as snow blankets the Midwest and threatens to fall across the South - in areas known more for swimsuits than snow boots.

Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee and other parts of the Midwest endured a second consecutive day of subzero highs on Tuesday, while much of the Northeast will see temperatures in the single digits and teens, Accuweather.com reported.
