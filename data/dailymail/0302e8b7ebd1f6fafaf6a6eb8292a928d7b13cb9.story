A devastating new bullet designed to 'take out all your vital organs' has been released - aimed squarely at women who worry about protecting their own homes.

Produced by Georgia based, G2 Research, the Radically Invasive Projectile or R.I.P, has been dubbed 'the last round you will ever need.'

Intended to splinter into eight inviscerating shards, the R.I.P was launched at the Las Vegas Shot Show in January and footage of the devastating impact of the bullet has gone viral.

Designed for home use: The president of G2R - the firm that produces the new R.I.P bullet has said that he is aiming the product to be used by women living on their own who want to protect their homes

The G2R website claims the R.I.P acts as a full metal jacket manufactured with trocar angles, which means that the each of the eight shards has three angles which taper to a point - to 'penetrate the dermis layer more efficiently.'

'It is capable of going through barriers such as sheet rock, plywood, sheet metal or glass and still performs its original intent. The bullet shreds through solid objects and only then, expands its energy,' claims the G2R website.

The company's president, Cliff Brown explained to the Blaze that a scared and lonely housewife worried about protecting her home is one of the target customer bases for the terrifying new ammunition.

'I wanted to create a round that would work well against a home intruder,' said company president Cliff Brown told the Blaze.

'There were so many stories out there about a woman trying to defend her home and having to shoot someone five or six times and they’d still come after her.

'We wanted to create an effective one-shot man-stopper.'

The frightening science behind bullets which expand and splinter having hit their target is that it cuts down on the risk of ricocheting as the body takes the whole brunt of the impact.

G2R officials said they tested the bullet in a range of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, as well as in rifles, with zero failures.

They claim to successfully tested the bullet in most firearms on the market including Sig, Glock, Beretta, Springfield, FN, Taurus, Walther, Khar, S&W and many others.

However, despite its power, the bullet is not capable of penetrating level 3A body armor - which is what law enforcement officials wear.

'That was one of our main goals when designing this bullet,' he told the Blaze. 

However, according to weapons enthusiast and political blogger, Richard Rowe, the new bullets bear an uncanny resemblance to Flechette bullets used in the Vietnam war but now banned under the Hague COnvention.

Standard bullets do most of their damage through a transference of kinetic energy in an expanding bubble around the projectile.

Flechette bullets operate in a different manner - they have tiny shards which act as spikes that penetrate the target and pass through the other side.

Rowe criticizes the R.I.P round because he says that because the shards of this bullet are copper, they won't pass through the victim.

He claims that they will more than likely come to rest inside the target - as witnessed in some of their promotional videos.

And furthermore, becasue the round is designed for 9mm handguns wielded by women, the R.I.P is a cruel home defense weapon because it will only cause maximum pain and suffering.
