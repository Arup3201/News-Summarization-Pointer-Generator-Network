England will be represented in the World Cup final after all - by two of its umpires.

Richard Kettleborough will be in the middle at the MCG on Sunday, alongside Sri Lanka's Kumar Dharmasena, when tournament co-hosts Australia and New Zealand do battle.

England were always long shots to reach the final but in the event did not do themselves justice, making an embarrassing early exit before the knockout stages even began.

Australia thrashed India in Sydney to set up a clash with their co-hosts at the Melbourne Cricket Ground

Their absence this weekend put their officials in a favourable position to be involved instead - given the need for neutral umpires - and Ian Gould will join Kettleborough in Melbourne, as the reserve appointment.

Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle will be match referee, and South Africa's Marais Erasmus the third umpire who must advise his on-field colleagues with audio-video evidence for DRS deliberations.
