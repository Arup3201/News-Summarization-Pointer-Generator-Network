It could have been a scene straight out of the ultra-violent video game.

Minutes after the Grand Theft Auto V game went on sale yesterday, yobs mugged a fan who’d been one of the first to buy it — battering him over the head with a brick and knifing him in the back.

The 23-year-old victim had queued for hours at a supermarket to buy the game and was on his way home when he was set upon by the teenage mob who demanded he hand it over.

Investigation: The attack happened in Princes Avenue, Colindale, at around 1.20am yesterday following the release of the game at midnight

When he refused, the gang of five or six youngsters gave chase, stabbing him in the back twice with a kitchen knife, before throwing a brick at his head, which sent him crashing to the ground.

The thugs ripped the computer game from his grasp and stole his mobile phone so he could not call for help.

Yesterday, the unnamed man was recovering in hospital where he was said to be in a stable condition.

Detectives believe the muggers 
specifically targeted him after seeing crowds of fans queuing in the car
 park of Asda superstore in Colindale,  North-West London.

Several stores across the country started selling the game at midnight as part of a worldwide release of the fifth in the blockbuster series to fans eager to get their hands on one of the most highly-anticipated games of all time.

The attack happened just after 1am when the thugs followed their victim to a deserted street.

It came as the makers of Grand Theft Auto faced fresh controversy over the new game’s gruesome torture scenes.

Alison Sherratt, president of the 
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she was worried about the 
impact on children. She said: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the 
dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents 
responsibility to keep children away from them.

‘But this scene takes things a step too far and the games makers need to consider what they are producing.

‘Children in our playgrounds display more violence. My concern is that little brother or sister walks into the room and starts watching something like this because an older brother is playing it.

‘They don’t understand the difference between reality and fiction because it’s so graphic and real, and they do copy it.

‘They imitate what they see and this scene is taking it way too far.’

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children.

Ms Sherratt added: ‘We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the 
Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I am astonished at the level of 
violence depicted in this game.

‘It
 is worrying that this type of content could be accessed by young 
people, particularly considering the previous links to real-life 
violence.

‘It is important that the video game industry takes steps to inform the public about the level of extreme content.

‘Responsibility also lies with parents to ensure their children do not access these games until it is appropriate.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 23-year-old man was shopping, then on his way back home he was hit with a brick and stabbed.

'He was robbed of items he had bought from a nearby Asda supermarket including a copy of Grand Theft Auto.

'We think he was attacked on Princes Avenue by multiple suspects although it is unclear how many at this stage.'

The scene of the attack remained cordoned off today while police appealed for witnesses.

The gunman who killed 12 people in a rampage through a Washington naval base was an obsessive player of violent video games, it emerged yesterday.

Aaron Alexis, 34, indulged in all-night sessions playing ‘shoot ’em up’ games such as Call Of Duty and Resident Evil.

The mentally disturbed killer’s gaming sessions would last up to 16 hours, according to former housemate Nutpisit Suthamtewakul.

‘He could be in the game all day and all night. I think games might be what pushed him that way,’ he said. There have been growing calls for research into links between violent games and real-life violence.

The AR-15 assault rifle that Alexis used is also one of the weapons in Call Of Duty. The game was also played by the Norway mass killer Anders Breivik and by Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old who shot dead 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Mr Suthamtewakul said Alexis fired a bullet through the wall of his room last year — but claimed it was an accident.
