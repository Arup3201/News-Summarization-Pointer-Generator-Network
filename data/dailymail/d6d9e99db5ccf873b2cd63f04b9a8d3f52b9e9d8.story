The BBC has today been accused of turning Question Time into a ‘joke’ after footballer Joey Barton compared voting for Ukip to picking up ugly girls in a nightclub. 

In a heated exchange on the flagship political show the Queens Park Rangers midfielder told a newly elected female Ukip MEP her party was just the least unattractive option.

To gasps from the audience, he told her: ‘You won the election? You won seats in the European Parliament that nobody really cares about'.

‘All you represent to me as Ukip is the 
best of a bad bunch. If I’m somewhere and there are four really ugly 
girls and I’m thinking she is not the worst, that is all you represent 
to us.’

Poor choice of words: Footballer Joey Barton compared voting Ukip to picking up ugly girls in a club

Attacks: Tory MP Stuart Andrew criticsed the programme

Out of his comfort zone: More used to kicking a ball in front of huge crowds, Barton admitted he was nervous

Louise Bours, an MEP for north west England, angrily responded, saying: ‘What an offensive thing to say. The ignorance that you spout it illustrates that footballers’ brains are in their feet.’

Mr Barton blamed his remarks on being 
nervous, saying he'd prefer 'Wembley and 87,000 any day of the week', 
but his performance has been called a 'new low' for the show.

Viewers last night criticised the BBC for its choice of panellists - who also included former newspaper editor Piers Morgan - as MPs from both sides of the political spectrum condemned the programme and Barton’s joke.

Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, Horsforth and Aireborough, tweeted: ‘BBC Question Time has become a joke.’

And Lucy Powell, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Childcare and Children, added: ‘Very unfortunate analogy there Joey.’

Making his point: Barton's first contribution was to say that the support for UKIP was a protest vote

Another Twitter user wrote: ‘Well Question Time has hit a new low with Joey Barton on the panel.’

While one posted: ‘Piers Morgan and Joey Barton on Question Time, wow it feels like some kind of Comic Relief spin-off joke.’

An audience member later confronted Barton about his remark. saying: 'I was with you in some of the things you said (but) I think the analogy you made of four ugly girls, that's going to be on Twitter tonight and tomorrow, you'll be buried for it.'

Barton replied: 'I do apologise - I couldn't think of a better one, this is the first time I have ever done it (Question Time).

'As Louise rightly pointed out my brains are in my feet, which is an equally offensive statement.

'Maybe I was a little bit nervous, I apologise.'

Afterwards Barton took to Twitter, telling fellow panellist, former News of the World editor Piers Morgan: 'I may have upset one or two women with an ill conceived metaphor. £imnewtothis.'

He later added: 'Should have left it at 'Best of a bad bunch' Ah well £imnewtothis @bbcquestiontime.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'Joey Barton was robustly challenged on his comments by both the panel and the audience. He apologised on the programme, putting his comment down to nerves. Question Time often features journalists, comedians, campaigners and other public figures to add a different perspective to the panel.'

Barton, who was called 'football's philosopher king' at the start of the show, is well known for holding court on political issues on Twitter. But he has a checkered history on and off the football pitch.

Mixed reviews: The QPR midfielder's performance on the BBC led to a huge reaction Twitter, good and bad

Losing respect: One fan described the moment as a 'new low' for the flagship panel show

Rowing back: Barton later apologised on Twitter as well, claiming that he is 'new to' being a panelist

Earlier yesterday, the Liberal Democrats
 criticised the BBC for not having a representative from their party 
despite speculation over the leadership of Nick Clegg leading the week’s
 headlines.

Its press office aired its frustration at not being including on the show – which last night had representatives from the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip - by tweeting: ‘@bbcquestiontime have refused to take a Liberal Democrat panellist tonight.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The Question Time panel is chosen carefully across the series and the Liberal Democrat party has appeared on every edition of Question time in the last six weeks.

‘As with the other political parties, the Liberal Democrats will again be invited to appear on the programme in the near future.’

Dinner time: Piers Morgan posted this photo of Barton and David Dimbleby and wrote: 'All smiles over #BBCQT dinner. Have to say - Le Pitbull @Joey7Barton is great company. For an ugly bloke.'
