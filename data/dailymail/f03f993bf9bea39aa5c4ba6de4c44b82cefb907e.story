Darren Fletcher revealed the prospect of captaining Scotland to victory again got him through some 'tough times'.

The midfielder fought back after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago but after a lengthy lay-off struggled to keep his place in the national team and at Manchester United.

However, the 31-year-old is enjoying a new lease of life at West Brom after joining the Baggies in the winter transfer window and Gordon Strachan asked him to lead out the Scots in Wednesday night's 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland at Hampden Park, as recent skipper Scott Brown was rested.

'It was great to be back,' said Fletcher. 'You are representing your country, you are captain, you win a game at home against Northern Ireland, it is things you thought about doing when you were going through tough times.

'It was a while since I played at Hampden, I was thinking that driving in. But I really enjoyed it and the pitch was really good as well.

'Scott wasn't starting so it was my turn to step up and be captain. I have said before, I am what I am now on and captain or not, I am going to be exactly the same.

'We have a lot of leaders in that dressing room which is important.

'There is competition for places which is great. It means I have to step up my performance when I play.

'It is great for the manager and great for the squad that we are all pushing each other and performing well.

'I feel great. I feel stronger with every 90 minutes and I am seeing improvement all the time so hopefully there is more to come as well.'

The match served as a warm-up for Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Group D minnows Gibraltar at the national stadium on Sunday and it took a late Christophe Berra header to separate the teams.

The Scots are all but certain to move on to 10 points after five fixtures against UEFA's newest member but Fletcher is too long in the tooth to go overboard about qualification hopes.

Since making his debut under Berti Vogts in a friendly against Norway in 2003, Scotland have failed six times to qualify for a major finals.

He said: 'We have great confidence in ourselves and in the group but I have been in this position before with Scotland and we have not managed to see it over the line.

'Everything we have done up until now has been great but the hard work is still to come.

'You have to keep reiterating that. We have an important match on Sunday.

'Win that and that takes us into the qualifier in June (away to Republic of Ireland) which is going to be an important game but there is still a lot of work to do.'

'We have put ourselves in a great position but the hard work begins now and let's see it out.'

Fletcher believes patience on and off the pitch will be key against a Gibraltar side who, after failing to score a goal, far less win a point, in four games, will have damage limitation on their minds.

He said: 'Hopefully the fans are patient with us when we are trying to play our football and break teams down.

'They were against Northern Ireland and it is important that they help us as much as they can.
