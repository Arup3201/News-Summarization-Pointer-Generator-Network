Nicky Morgan has delivered her strongest criticism yet of the culture at the Department for Education under Michael Gove.

The Education Secretary last night said she wanted a partnership with teachers rather than a war of ideas.

She said she intended to ‘tone down the rhetoric’ and was no ‘ideological warrior’ out to impose her world view on schools.

Her speech marks the clearest breach yet with her predecessor, who was widely seen to have lost the trust of teachers.

‘My request is that we tone down the rhetoric and let’s have a reasoned debate based on what works,’ she said.

‘For those looking for an ideological sparring partner to do battle with, quite simply I’m not your woman.’

Mrs Morgan insisted that she remained committed to Mr Gove’s reforms, which have paved the way for a new generation of free schools and a dramatic expansion of the academy programme introduced by Tony Blair. 

But she has been accused of a number of U-turns over his reforms, including scrapping Mr Gove’s policy of allowing misbehaving children to be punished by making them run around a playing field.

Mrs Morgan indicated in her speech at Birmingham University that she felt uncomfortable with Mr Gove’s battle with the education establishment, which his allies dubbed ‘the blob’. 

She said: ‘Somewhere along the way, what got lost in the heated debates and the drive for change, was who these changes were for and why we were making them.

‘So let me be clear here and now. 

'As Education Secretary I’m committed to implementing these reforms, not because I’m an ideological warrior, determined to impose my world view on schools and young people.

'The reason I support these reforms is for one simple reason. Because they work.’ 

Mrs Morgan replaced Mr Gove in the summer reshuffle, with a brief of mending fences with teachers. 

He was moved to the post of Chief Whip.

Underlining her new approach, she said: ‘Too often education policy is portrayed as a war between rival camps of true believers, when the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. 

'The best example of that? The thousands of teachers across the country who have quietly put our changes to the education system into action.’

Mrs Morgan also said parents should be encouraged to take more responsibility for their children’s education by helping with reading and learning times tables.

They should also back heads who discipline their children rather than standing in their way, she added. 

And families should refrain from taking term-time holidays except in exceptional circumstances to stop children ‘missing out’.
