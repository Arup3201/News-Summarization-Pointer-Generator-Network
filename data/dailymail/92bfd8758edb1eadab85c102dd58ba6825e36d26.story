An unidentified sexual predator has been assaulting women on Melbourne's crowded trams.

Police say the man gets on the tram in inner-city Carlton on Elgin Street during the morning peak hour rush and indecently assaults female commuters.

'In most cases the female victims tell the offender to leave them alone and get off the tram around Lonsdale Street,' a police statement has said.

The man is known to often be on either route 1 or 8 and stops at Melbourne Central.

He has followed the same routine most days since July.

He wears similar clothing every day which is described as a dark grey Adidas jumper, dark coloured track pants and carries a large duffel bag.

Police are currently appealing for witnesses and are urging anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.
