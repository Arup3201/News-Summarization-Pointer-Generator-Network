A grocery store worker is lucky to be alive after being caught in the middle of a shooting where a stray bullet hit his belt buckle.

Bienvenido Reynoso, 38, was at work inside the 8 Brother's Supermarket in Grays Ferry, Philadelphia when he heard gunshots ring out around 4pm on Wednesday.

Mr Reynoso can be seen on shop surveillance footage throwing himself on the floor as shots hit the shelving above him. He frantically pats down his body to work out if he has been hit.

It was only after the shooting that Mr Reynoso found the bullet embedded in his slim belt. He told ABC he had been 'born again' following the experience.

On the security tape, a piece of cake can be seen falling on the grocery store worker's head after it was hit by a bullet - where he had been standing seconds earlier.

However Mr Reynoso said that he would now be looking for a new job because he did not want to tempt fate.

The owner of the grocery store Joselito Vinas also told the TV station that around the time of the shooting he had planned to hand out free shaved ices to local children.

He had been ten minutes late arriving at his store, a coincidence which likely saved many lives.

Lyons is charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault, police said.
