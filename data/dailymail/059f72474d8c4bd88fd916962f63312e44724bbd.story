Two African American care home employees  have accused their bosses of stopping them working with a white patient as he refused to be cared for by black people.

Shiawassee County Medical Care Facility, in Corunna, Michigan, allegedly told them that they could not work with the patient, according to TV5.

Nursing assistant Andrea Butler said: '[I've] never, ever been treated like this before. It hurts, it really hurts, especially because I'm there to take care of them.'

Shocked: Andrea Butler was told that she was not permitted to care for a white patient

Allegations: Shiawassee County Medical Care Facility, in Corunna, Michigan, allegedly told them that they could not work with the patient

She added that she was told of the news in front of staff and residents in the care home.

The resident had complained of being bruised by an African American employee, but later admitted that the story was not true. She claims that the situations are very similar.

Nurse Tonya Battle has spoken out about the case. She was told  by staff at Hurley medical Centre she couldn't care for a newborn at the request of the baby's white parents.

Hurt: The nursing assistant was furious that the medical facility allowed it to happen

Respect: The hospital said that it has to listen to the wishes of its patients and that the situation would be dealt with the same if it was about gender not race

She said: ‘It's outrageous that a medical facility would grant this request, especially on the heels of the battle against Hurley Medical Centre case, that there was a public outcry that a patient's request based on race would be granted.’

‘In my legal opinion, a patient can not request somebody to not work with them based on race. This is clearly illegal under federal law, I believe it's illegal under state law as well.’

The hospital was approached by TV5. Facility administrator Rick Cordonnier said: ‘We are protecting staff members from potential allegations.’

He said that they need to respect patient’s request for their care, and would treat the situation the same if they did not want someone of the opposite gender.
