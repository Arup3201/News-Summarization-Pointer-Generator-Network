Tragedy: Laurence, 6, and his grandmother Dawn Mullany, 71, drowned in February this year

A grandmother and her six-year-old grandson both drowned after falling into a freezing pond as they fed the ducks, an inquest heard.

Dawn
Mullany, 71, and Laurence Mullany-Mills were pulled from a pond near 
Holywell village in Lincolnshire after clothes and a bag of breadcrumbs were found by the water’s edge in February this year.

An
extensive police search began after they failed to return to Mrs 
Mullany’s home in Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire where Laurence’s clothes were found 
and food was defrosting on the kitchen bench.

Laurence’s
mother, and Mrs Mullany’s daughter, Asmina Mullany-Mills, 42, called police 
at 9.20pm on February 16 when there was no sign of them.

An
inquest into their deaths heard yesterday that Mrs Mullany’s body was 
dragged from the water after she was found face down in the pond at around 10.40pm.

Attempts to resuscitate her at the scene were unsuccessful and she was later pronounced dead at Peterborough City Hospital.

RAF
Search and Rescue and police dogs were drafted in for the desperate 
search for Laurence, but he was tragically found at 6.26am the next day,
six feet underwater.

Post-mortem examinations revealed both had drowned and ruled out any foul play or third party involvement.

Laurence's
mother Asmina and father Vaughan said at the time of the 
double tragedy that it had left 'a hole in our lives that can never be 
filled'.

No
witnesses came forward to say they had seen Mrs Mullany or Laurence by
the pond but a number of people said they had seen the two 
together in the early afternoon.

Chief
Inspector David Keith Wood of Lincolnshire Police told the inquest: 
‘Dawn and Laurence were reported missing when Laurence’s mother learned 
they had not returned home.

Breadcrumbs: An extensive police search began after the pair failed to return home. Mrs Mullany's body was dragged from the pond after a bag of breadcrumbs was found at the water's edge

‘Police investigated the home of Dawn Mullany and found there to be nothing suspicious.

‘On the kitchen side, there was food defrosting, suggesting the family had intended to return home.

‘An
extensive search began, with police appealing for witnesses, in a hunt 
to find the missing vehicle, the young boy and his grandma.

‘The body of Dawn was found first in the water. She was not far from the lake edge and her body surrounded by bread crumbs.

'Infectious smile': Laurence with his mother Asmina Mullany-Mills and young sister Nancy. In a statement at the time of the tragedy, Laurence's parents said 'Laurence was a gentle and caring brother to Nancy'

‘The little boy was found underwater by a gate in the lake. A gate used for the movement of water.’

When asked by the coroner if Laurence may have become stuck on the gate, Inspector Wood said he could not confirm either way.

Family ties: Laurence had a 'special relationship' with his grandmother, who lived nearby

He
said: ‘The examination of both the recovered bodies indicated no form 
of assault and there was nothing suspicious at the scene.’

Coroner
Professor Robert Forrest said that due to the lack of conclusion from 
the evidence, he would record a narrative verdict outlining formally
what happened and how the pair died.

He
said: ‘As I said when we started, this is a short inquest but the 
length of this inquest is no reflection on the magnitude of this case. 
It is no reflection on the tragedy and loss.

‘I
could possibly return the verdict of accidental death, and while I do 
not think that the incidents surrounding the death are not suspicious, I
cannot return that verdict.

‘I cannot record an accidental death verdict because we don’t know what happened that day.

‘I can formally confirm that the cause of death by injury or disease for Dawn Mullany was drowning on February 16 2012.

‘Whilst there were no suspicious circumstances I cannot establish exactly what happen.

‘I don’t doubt that the loss of these two people has been devastating for their family.

'I
would like to offer my condolences to all of the relatives, 
particularly Laurence’s parents who have lost a not only a son but a 
grandmother too.’

Laurence’s parents, both 42, who also have a daughter Nancy, 2, were too upset to speak today.

At the time of the tragedy they said in a statement: 'Dawn was adored by all. She was a great friend, a loving mother and above all, a doting and devoted grandmother.

'Her passion and affection for life will never be forgotten.

'Laurence was a gentle and caring brother to Nancy. He was a son with a wonderfully infectious smile who could warm the coldest place or light the darkest room.

'He had a limitless, bristling and bubbly enthusiasm for the new, and a burning curiosity to get involved with everything and anything, whether taking to the stage or the rugby field.'

They added that their son - also known as Laurie - had a 'special relationship' with his grandmother who lived nearby.

No family members attended the inquest.
