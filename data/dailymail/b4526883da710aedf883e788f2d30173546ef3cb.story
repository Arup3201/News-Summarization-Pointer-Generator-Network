We all know Kim Kardashian cheats her way to defined cheekbones and a thinner face with a little help from contouring but it seems that she's such a fan of the beauty trick that she's been using the technique on her entire body.

Kim, 33, famed for her curves, has been using Charlotte Tilbury's £45 Supermodel Body to define and enhance her legs.

Speaking about the product, which is described as the perfect way to cheat your dream body without the workout, Kim said: 'It's legendary! I used it on my legs.'

Make-up maestro Charlotte, who shared her beauty tips with Kim during her time in London, said of the product: 'I have poured all my make-up artist know-how into creating this incredible slimmer shimmer that acts like shapewear lingerie for the skin.'

The product is enriched with FermiProtect, a wild shitake extract that protects the collagen fibres in the skin, aiming to make your skin look and feel firmer, toned and supple; this is what creates the contours. 

It also contains precious-metal highlighter mix to re-create Charlotte's secret 'celebrity limb trick' - the technique whereby she highlights down the centre of legs and arms to create the illusion of leaner, longer limbs.

There's also lots of caffeine within it, which promises to detox the skin tissues, reducing unevenness in the skin and any bloated puffiness, which menthol works to promote micro-circulation and blood-flow. 

'It's easy body makeup-in-a-minute,' adds Charlotte, who applies it by twisting the applicator and rolling the cooling-metal massager down the centre of  limbs, which promotes lymphatic drainage, then blends out with her hands. 

Charlotte added: 'Any stylist will tell you that wearing black slims, streamlines and contours, but white widens. They’re basic laws of art, photography and makeup artistry. I always use the same principles when body contouring.

'You can elongate and slim by highlighting down the centre, and shading at the edges. I’ve using this trick on the glorious angels of the runway and stars on the red carpet for years.'

Speaking about working with the reality TV star, Charlotte said: 'I had the pleasure of working with the charming and absolutely beautiful Kim Kardashian - she has the most outrageously natural long lashes I've ever seen!'.

Kim has just finished a stint in France, where she's been supporting her younger sister Kendall's modelling career at Paris Fashion Week.

On Tuesday, however, the mother-of-one skipped Kendall's appearance at the Chanel show, instead heading to Studio Zero for a secret photoshoot with supermodel Cara Delevingne - believed to be for Love magazine.

Kim showed off a sexy collection of outfits during her time in Paris including a daring lace jumpsuit worn to the Givenchy show on Sunday evening and a cleavage-baring blouse for an outing the following day.
