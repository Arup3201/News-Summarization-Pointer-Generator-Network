Three Tottenham Hotspur players were dropped by Belgium manager Marc Wilmots as they beat Russia 1-0 at the World Cup to secure qualification for the last-16.

Nacer Chadli, Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele were all replaced in the starting line-up as Russia frustrated the Belgians.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku failed to impose themselves on the match and will need to improve if Belgium do hold hopes of going far in this tournament.

Thibaut Courtois

Every time you see this keeper you cannot help but be impressed.

Following a phenomenal season on loan at Atletico Madrid - which bagged him a La Liga title and a Champions League final - Courtois has taken his form into the World Cup in Brazil.

This was his 100th career clean sheet and he is only 22. Jose Mourinho and Chelsea, take notice.

Courtois commands his box so well and every single cross from the Russian side he was quick to catch and hold.

A couple of decent saves from Alexander Kokorin in the first half and another from Maksim Kanunnikov were all he had to do really, but he did it was ease which was impressive.

Vincent Kompany

Dominant display.

Whenever the Manchester City centre back has the ball at his feet he looks so composed and rarely puts a foot wrong.

Was caught out of position just before half-time as Kokorin ghosted in between the centre backs to nod a free header wide, but apart from that he looked extremely assured.

If Belgium are to go far in this tournament then they will need him to stay fit and lead from the front.

Jan Vertonghen

One of three Spurs players dropped before the match for Belgium, he soon was back on the pitch following Thomas Vermaelen's injury.

He sometimes struggles for pace at full back and was caught out a few times, but overall he is a tidy footballer and is very solid.

Comfortable afternoon for him in all honesty as Fabio Capello's Russia offered so little going forward.

Substitute: Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen (left) was dropped but came on after 31 minutes

Solid: Vertonghen did his job well at left back once he replaced the injured Vermaelen for Belgium

Thomas Vermaelen

It just has not been his season.

Dropped by Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, persistent injury problems curtailed him from being able to force his way back into his club side.

He was given his chance here at left-back and had done relatively little wrong before he was forced down the tunnel with an injury after just 31 minutes. He suffered a knee injury during the warm-up and had to come off.

Very disappointing for him.

Knock: Vermaelen suffered a knee injury in the warm-up and has been plagued by fitness problems

Eden Hazard

Again Hazard really struggled to leave up to the hype in this match - until the final three minutes.

Two frustrating performances for the Chelsea man - Dries Mertens has been Belgium's shining light and Hazard has been merely an observer for large parts - but he has provided two assists in two games now.

A few decent tricks and flicks but he kept giving the ball away and there was no end product until, with 87 minutes on the clock, he jinked inside two Russian players and laid the ball off for Divock Origi to bag the winner.

If he can find form then Belgium could really be strong in the latter stages of this tournament, but Hazard doesn't look entirely comfortable with this formation.

Nothing seems to be happening for the little magician at the moment.

Tricky: Hazard was frustrated for large parts of the match but came up with an assist late-on

Control: Hqzard only showed glimpses of the quality that he possesses in the match against Russia

Improvement: If Belgium can get the best out of Hazard then they could go far in Brazil

Romelu Lukaku

It really has not been the Chelsea man's tournament has it.

He was extremely poor again for Belgium following his anonymous display against Algeria.

After failing to register a shot in his first match, or even making a touch in the opposition penalty area, he looked lethargic and did not work hard enough for Wilmots' men against Russia.

The ball kept bouncing back from him towards Russian defenders and would not stick to hit feet.

He was deservedly replaced for the second match in a row by Lille's 19-year-old forward Origi after 57 minutes, who has offered far more than Lukaku has and bagged Belgium's winner.

Is Mourinho being proved right in refusing to give the big man a chance to lead the line at Chelsea?

Poor: Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku (left) was again disappointing for Belgium and was replaced on 57 minutes

Off the pace: The ball kept bouncing off Lukaku and he was not able to get himself into the game

Option: Lukaku's replacement Origi (left) netted the winner with three minutes to go

Marouane Fellaini

The Manchester United midfielder was rewarded for his equaliser against Iran with a start against Russia but he did little right, or little wrong.

A fairly non-descriptive performance from Fellaini who really did not dominate and use his huge physical presence as well as he should have done.

There were a few aerial challenges won and a few neat interchanges with Mertens in the first half but, as Belgium were pushed deeper in the second half, Fellaini offered little threat.

Needs to do more.

Average: Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini (centre) did little right or wrong for Belgium

Committed: Fellaini competes for the ball with Russia's Dmitry Kombarov during Belgium's 1-0 win

Kevin Mirallas

Replaced Mertens after 75 minutes.

Mertens had been Belgium's best player in the first half but faded in the second.

Mirallas hit the post with a free-kick with seven minutes remaining, probably Belgium's best chance, and then should have scored in injury time when he was set one-on-one by Eden Hazard but shot straight at the goalkeeper.

Had a fantastic season at Everton but struggling to get into this Belgian side at the moment but, given a start, he could prove the difference for them.
