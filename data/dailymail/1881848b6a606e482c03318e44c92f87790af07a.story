Tank the tortoise is so small he can comfortably nestle inside the head of a spoon.

At just 1.5in long (3.8cm), the six-month old Hermann's tortoise is dwarfed by a lip balm and makes a computer mouse look gigantic.

And while he may be small, Paradise Wildlife Park's latest tenant has proved a big hit with visitors.

Visitors to the park in 
Hertfordshire have been amazed by the cute critter, who was gifted by 
previous head of reptiles Ross Hickles as a leaving present.

Brave: Tank lives up to his mighty name as he sits on top of a lion's head but is so small he is miniscule next to a lip balm

He is now wowing crowds with his lust for life - despite his minute frame.

A spokesman for Paradise Wildlife Park said: 'Everyone loves him, they think he’s really cute.

'I challenge anyone to meet him and not instantly break out into an "Awww". He is spreading joy to all the visitors.

'Despite his size he has a real energy for life. But he will eventually grow to the size of an average tortoise.'

Staff at the Wildlife Park have pictured Tank next to a host of items to show his scale mini stature.

He has certainly lived up his fearsome name by posing on the head of a lion.

Tank is only the size of a standard key but is expected to grow to about seven times his current size.

However, he will have to wait a while as he will not be fully grown until between the ages of six and eight.

Tank was born alongside his brother, who is now cared for by a private collector.

Hermann’s
tortoise originate from southern Spain and France where they roam the 
meadows looking for food with their good sense of smell.

They typically have between two and 12 eggs per clutch, and live on average until the age of 30.
