His face blackened by soot and oil from hours spent aboard a blazing passenger ferry, rescued Briton Nick Channing-Williams admitted yesterday that he feared he would not escape the inferno.

The 37-year-old showjumper was one of the last of more than 400 passengers and crew taken by helicopter from the Norman Atlantic at the climax of a massive rescue operation lasting 36 horrific hours in rain-lashed, stormy seas.

At least ten people died during the fire in the Adriatic and Mr Channing-Williams told of moments of absolute terror when he did not think he would live.

A massive rescue operation lasting 36 horrific hours in rain-lashed, stormy seas got under way as the Norman Atlantic (pictured) went up in flames 

Speaking after being reunited with his Greek fiancée Regina Theoffili, who had been rescued from the roll-on, roll-off ferry hours earlier, he said: ‘When the flames are licking up around the boat and there is just no sign of help and they are talking about sending a boat that is going to be four hours away you feel somewhat helpless.’

As alarms sounded, he went up on to the main deck. ‘The flames were huge, and all the cars were on fire,’ he said. ‘It was very scary, to be honest. There was only one place you could stand, which was in the rain.’

Passengers spent hours awaiting rescue, shivering and shaking in the rain and cold because, like him, they had not had the chance to gather suitable clothing.

Panic set in as the ferry began to list on to its side, lines to rescue crafts snapped and the deck became red hot from the flames engulfing areas below containing some 200 cars and lorries.

Mr Channing-Williams said: ‘The fire was basically cooking everybody’s feet and everyone was in a queue to get on a lifeboat. With the heat being so enormous, people just panicked. I didn’t even try and get on one. Regina and I were stood upstairs and just hoped for the best, really, that someone would come and help us.’

He said he spent Sunday night at the front of the ferry with other people after climbing down a rope to try unsuccessfully to help tie lines from a tugboat to the ferry.

At one point they were trapped when flames blocked their path.

He also described how his fiancée saw one man slip to his death beneath the ferry after slipping on the bottom rung of a ladder. Mr Channing-Williams, who lives near Athens, was travelling to see his family in Berkshire for New Year.

He described his reunion with his fiancée as ‘quite emotional because we were separated for a few hours and in the early hours I was starting to question whether we were going to get off it or not’.

He was uninjured. Mr Channing-Williams’s mother Dottie, 70, from Wickham, Berkshire, shed tears of relief after her son borrowed an emergency worker’s telephone to say he was safe.

427 people were rescued, including 56 crew,but the original ship’s manifest listed 478 passengers and crew

‘I’m so relieved he’s coming home,’ she said. ‘This is going to be the best New Year ever.’

Her son and his fiancée had been travelling from the western Greek port of Patras to Ancona in Italy when the fire mysteriously broke out below the main deck near Corfu.

The Italian government said 427 people were rescued, including 56 crew, but the original ship’s manifest listed 478 passengers and crew. Officials could not immediately explain the discrepancy.

Italian prosecutors announced yesterday that they had opened a criminal investigation into the ferry fire and would look into whether negligence had played a role.

It is still unclear what caused the blaze to break out on a car deck of the Norman Atlantic on Sunday, but investigators will focus on whether a lorry packed with olive oil may have triggered the disaster. The lorry was too tall for the car deck so that it just fitted in to the allocated area and at one stage during the rough seas its metal roof is reported to have begun scraping the ferry’s ceiling causing sparks that may have ignited the blaze.

Only nine days before it caught fire, an inspection of the 26,904-ton ferry, which was operated by Greek shipping company Anek, found it had failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency.

Among those also rescued was Briton Marcus Gondolo-Gordon, a former film and advertising manager, wife, Mia, and daughters Phaedra, seven, and Seraphina, five. The family, who live in Corfu, had been on their way to a skiing holiday.

Speaking after collecting Seraphina from hospital where she was treated for hypothermia – many families had rushed on to the deck when the sirens sounded, leaving behind warm clothes – he said: ‘It’s been an ordeal but thankfully we are all safe and well.’

Italian, Greek and Albanian ships and helicopters were involved in a fraught rescue hampered by thunderstorms that at one stage saw tugs flanking the damaged, blazing ferry to provide protection from the waves as helicopters attempted to lift passengers to safety – women, children and the elderly first.

Most of those rescued were transferred to nearby ships, but some were taken directly to hospital.

Other survivors spoke of passengers trampling over one another and fights breaking out among men forcing their way on to helicopters before women and children.

Turkish passenger Saadet Bayhan said: ‘We experienced the Titanic. The only thing missing was that we didn’t sink.’
