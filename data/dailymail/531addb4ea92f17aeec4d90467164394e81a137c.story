A two-in-one treatment could revolutionise the care of men with advanced prostate cancer.

Patients who undergo surgery as well as drug treatment are twice as likely to still be alive 14 years later as those given medication alone, a study found.

If further research confirms the effect, the management of late-stage prostate cancer could be ‘revolutionised’, said the researchers.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, affecting 41,000 a year and claiming almost 11,000 lives.

Advanced cancer, which has spread to other parts of the body, is normally treated with drugs that mop up the male hormones it needs to grow.

Men live for an average of five years after starting testosterone-blocking drugs.

In the latest study, British and Swedish researchers looked at whether surgery combined with this hormonal therapy is better than the therapy alone.

Half of the 1,400 men studied had their prostate removed before starting testosterone-blocking drugs. The other half simply had the drug treatment. Some 321 men given drugs alone died during the course of the study – twice as many as in the group given surgery and medicine.

Although radical prostatectomy, or prostate removal, is used in earlier stages of the disease, it is not normally carried out once the cancer has spread throughout the body.

This is because it is thought that the cancer has such a grip that there is little point in trying to contain it.

There are also concerns about putting patients through surgery, plus prostate removal can cause distressing side effects such as  impotence and incontinence.

However, the latest research, released at the European Association of Urology’s annual conference, suggests that the prostate is still fuelling the cancer, even after it has spread elsewhere.

The conference heard that recent research has focused on developing new drugs. However, combining  surgery with the standard treatment seems more promising.

Lead author Professor Peter  Wiklund, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, cautioned that further studies are needed but said the  combined treatment could ‘revolutionise the management of advanced prostate cancer’.

Mikis Euripides, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘While this is a valid line of inquiry, the evidence isn’t enough to conclude that men with advanced prostate cancer would be better off having a radical prostatectomy.

‘However, the findings do indicate that there may be value in conducting a larger clinical trial.’
