Forget your quest to take the perfect selfie, a new trend is set to sweep the internet that requires more than just a well-angled pout.

Called the ‘donut selfie’, it involves using panoramic video shots of your head to create a seamless selfie that travels across different locations

The technique was created by ex-Microsoft employee Karen Cheng while she was experimenting with sweeping camera motions.

‘I did one that was from one side of my head to the other - made a donut around my head - and the video started looping and woahhhh that looks cool,’ explained Ms Cheng.

‘Soon enough I was running all around the city trying to get cool shots, playing with slo mo effects and iPhone lens attachments, and this is the result.’

The social media star has since released a video that shows the camera spinning around her head, with the scenery changing each time from her workplace, to a train station and even her bed.

Ms Cheng explains that you can create your own doughnut selfie using the front-facing camera on a smartphone.

Starting from one side of your temple, arc the phone around your head, across your face and to the other side, while capturing scenery in the background.

This gives the impression to viewers that they are passing through a subject’s head and arriving in a different location each time, said Ms Cheng.

The process can be repeated as many times as needed and in as many like as you’d like, with the clips edited together using an app.

Ms Cheng, who is based in San Francisco, created her video using an iPhone and edited it with iMovie.

She has put together a three-part tutorial as part of a dedicated website describing the technique.

Selfie fans, your life just got a little easier.

A Swedish tech start-up has launched an app for Apple devices that lets people take photos of themselves without having to touch their screens.

Using touchless technology, which it says is ideal for taking 'selfies' or 'groupies', Crunchfish's GoCam app lets users trigger photos or videos from a distance with just hand gestures.

Photos can be triggered from a distance of up to 10 ft (3 metres), the company claims.

The technology uses something known as Touchless A3D software which detects and tracks different gestures.

It does this using a video stream from the camera in the mobile phone, picking up on particular movements, such as a wave of a hand.

The company, based in the southern Swedish city of Malmo, says the free GoCam app is currently only available in Sweden and Australia.
