If you thought your Christmas shopping list was long, spare a thought for pensioner Mary Scholey.

The 82-year-old can't afford to leave her present buying to the last minute because she has to find and wrap the perfect gift for each of her 80 grandchildren. 

As well as the presents Mrs Scholey, who has 10 children, remembers the names of all her 33 grandchildren, 44 great-grandchildren, and three great-great grandchildren to send them all a Christmas card.

Super-gran: This Christmas Mary Scholey, 82, has had to buy and wrap presents for each of her 80 grandchildren

'I don't know how she does it, especially as she's getting older - it's amazing,' said son Stephen Gregory.

'She writes the majority or cards for herself and goes to Barnsley and Wombwell markets to find presents. It's a massive task.'

Mrs Scholey who lives with her husband Raymond in Sheffield, South Yorkshire had 10 children with her first husband Jim, who died about 20 years ago.

The pensioner, known as Nanan Mary by the youngest in the family, said: 'I never really thought I would have a big family but 60 years ago there wasn't that much of a choice in the matter.

'I had two sets of twins and six other children so the family just kept on growing.

'Christmas is a busy time because there are so many of us but it's nice to see everybody. It's always busy here anyway so I'm used to that.

'When I first had grandchildren I told them to call me Nan because I thought Grandma sounded too old. All of the little ones call me Nanan, they just always have. 

'I don't find it difficult to keep up with all the names. We are not on Facebook or anything so I get all of the news about my family through word of mouth.'

Mrs Scholey's reams of relatives try to get together for special occasions, such as milestone birthdays and weddings, but it is no mean feat.

As an early Christmas present for the pensioner 100 family members gathered at a Working Men's Club in Sheffield. 

'It was lovely to see them all and when they saw me they were all in a queue to give me a kiss. I enjoyed that,' she said.

Mrs Scholey said she never thought she would have a big family

'When everybody was together it was easy to see how big the family really is.

'My son Stephen thought it would be a good idea to get the family together.' 

Her offspring included two sets of twins, and the family has just kept on growing since.

Mrs Scholey's children include: mum-of-three Lesley, aged 62; 60-year-old dad-of-two Stephen; father-of-three Neil, 58; 55-year-old dad-of-four Peter; mother-of-four Vicky, 54; 50-year-old mum-of-three Debbie, and 45-year-old twins Josie and Jane, both mums-of-three, as well as mum-of- three Jacqueline and Stephen's twin Stuart, a dad-of-five, who have both passed away.

Four more great, great grandchildren are due next year to join her youngest relatives, including seven-month-old Harper Blu, daughter of Neil's daughter Keeley.

Mr Gregory said: 'With her having 10 children, we didn't need to produce many children for the family to grow quite rapidly.

'She gets a fair few visitors with grandchildren dropping in to see her.

'She's a classic nan in that she doesn't stand for any nonsense, but she's very loving. Family certainly comes first for her. 

'Most of the family live in the Sheffield area though there are a few relatives in Austria, Jersey and Australia.

'I'd be intrigued to know if there is a bigger family in Sheffield. Ten children and almost 100 grandchildren is some going - we must be one of the biggest.'
