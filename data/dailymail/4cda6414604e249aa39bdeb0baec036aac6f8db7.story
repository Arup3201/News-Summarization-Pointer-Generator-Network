The International Polo Club Palm Beach tycoon charged with vehicular manslaughter in the death of another driver while intoxicated reeked so strongly of alcohol it seemed to be coming from his pores, according to testimony at his trial today.

John Goodman, 48, is accused of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter in the death of 23-year-old Scott Wilson in February 2010.

Palm Beach County Sheriff's Deputy Richard Safford, testified that the defendant smelled so strongly of alcohol that it ‘was like it was almost coming directly from his pores.’

Describing the smell of alcohol, the police officer told the court he had to let down the windows of his patrol car ‘to let it just clear out.’

Fellow deputy, Mitch Rieger, also agreed that Goodman had a ‘strong smell of alcohol.’

Robert, an emergency medical technician who was at the scene, testified that Goodman appeared to have been drinking.

'I felt he had a couple of drinks. He stated that to us,' Perreault told the court, but added that he did not believe Goodman has consumed a large amount of alcohol.

Goodman, 48, told him he had 'a couple glasses of wine,' Perreault said.

Witness Lisa Pembleton, who was awakened when Goodman, walking from the crash site, banged on her door and asked to use her phone, spoke in court.

She overheard Goodman make a phone call to a 'lady in Georgia,' telling the woman 'I really f***ked up' and had been in 'an end of the world accident,' Pembleton recalled.

Pembleton said Goodman asked how he 'seemed to her.' She told him she couldn't tell and told him he should call 911.

As he left her trailer home, Pembleton said he offered her a 'wad of bills' - money she did not accept.

Goodman's girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, took to the stand today and said she didn't remember Goodman telling 
her of an 'end of the world accident,' but said he told her he had been 
in an accident. She also said Goodman did not mention a car malfunction 
or having a head injury.

According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign in his Bentley convertible on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal.

Goodman was charged with DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash.

In a stunning move last fall, Goodman adopted his adult girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins, 42, entitling her to up to a third of his biological children's trust fund, worth $300million.

Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post.

Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported.

The adoption papers state that Ms Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust.

Goodman and Ms Hutchins have been dating in 2009, according to her testimony.

The Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets.

'It cannot go unrecognised that [Goodman] chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper.

Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court 'into a legal twilight zone.'

Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told MyFoxOrlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more.

'It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said.

Arrested: John Goodman is currently on trial for the DUI death of Wilson

Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer.

He had been driving his Hyundai home to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign.

Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned.

Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show.

Yesterday was the second day of testimony in the case, in which Goodman faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty.

Jury selection began on March 6.

The Wilsons have already settled 
privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had 
been drinking in February 2010.

They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated.

Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage.

In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children.
