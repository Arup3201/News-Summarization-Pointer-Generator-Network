Revelations: Chris Skidmore, MP for Kingswood, discovered foreign nationals who are treated medically in the UK but do not pay their NHS bills have cost the service more than £40 million

Foreign nationals who are treated medically in the UK but do not pay their NHS bills have cost the service more than £40 million, a Tory MP claimed today.

Chris Skidmore discovered 118 trusts had written off a staggering £42 million - and believes the total figure could be more than £50 million as he is still due responses from another 66 trusts.

The MP for Kingswood, Bristol, made the revelation in the Commons as senior Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said all foreign nationals should sign an agreement when entering the country not to claim free treatment on the NHS.

Health Minister Simon Burns said the Government was aware of the problem and was looking at banning foreign nationals from re-entering the UK if they had an unpaid bill for treatment on the NHS.

According to figures collated by Mr Skidmore's office, Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust in London is the worst offender.

It has written off £6.2 million since 2004 and has another £1.8 million of outstanding debt it is still hoping to collect.

Croydon Health Services has written off £1.6 million but elsewhere in the country the figures are much lower.

Speaking outside the Commons, Mr Skidmore said: 'In terms of the NHS, services are going to be stretched over the next few years and it is worth looking at who is using those services.

'It's a worrying trend that has increased over the last couple of years and it is one that my constituents get very angry about. It's unnecessary and shouldn't happen.'

Mr Skidmore said a scheme in Slough, where foreign nationals not entitled to free health care are offered the minimum amount of treatment they need following an accident before being asked to leave hospital, should be rolled out elsewhere in the country.

He added: 'This would not be a big saving but it's the principle of knowing who is using the NHS.

'If you are not paying British taxes and you are not a British citizen, then there is no reason why you should have free health services.

'It's a national health service, not an international one.'

Under current rules, foreign nationals residing in the UK and paying taxes are entitled to free treatment on the NHS while the bill for European Union citizens is sent to their home country.

But visitors from outside the EU are expected to either have health insurance or they are sent the bill. Many leave the UK after receiving treatment without paying it.

Mr Vaz said the problem could be easily solved.

He told the Commons: 'There is a relatively painless way of dealing with this. At the time the visa is applied for, the person coming should sign an undertaking that they will pay the costs of their treatment.'

Mr Burns said the Government was already looking at solving the problem of foreign nationals not paying for the NHS for treatment they receive.

He said the practice was an 'important issue' for the NHS and the Government was looking at a 'whole range of options'.

Mr Burns told the Commons: 'We have updated and simplified regulations and guidance on identifying and charging visitors who must pay. Immigration rules which are now before parliament will allow the UK Borders Agency to refuse entry to visitors with an unpaid debt to the NHS.

'We are now reviewing this area more fundamentally to identify further improvements.'

Mr Skidmore made his discovery after submitting Freedom of Information requests to primary care trusts (PCTs) and foundation trusts up and down the country.
