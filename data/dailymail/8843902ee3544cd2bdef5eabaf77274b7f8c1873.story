A French tourist has been arrested for scaling Brooklyn Bridge in an apparent attempt to take photos of the view, according to police.

The man, identified as Yonathan Souid, 23, from Esnandes in south western France, faces charges of reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing.

It is the third such incident in just four months, following the similar arrest of a Russian tourist in August and a stunt by two German artists to replace the U.S. Stars and Stripes with white flags - a move which raised questions about security on the bridge.

Wong move: The man, identified as Yonathan Souid, 23, from Esnandes in south western France, faces charges of reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing

Souid was arrested after jumping a fence and climbing up a beam on the bridge that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, a police spokesman confirmed.

The incident occurred around 12:30pm local time (17.30 GMT) and Souid climbed back down at the request of a patrol officer, who saw him, and was detained.

He is due to be formally charged today, said a spokesman from the Brooklyn prosecutor's office. 

He has remained in custody. 

'The Brooklyn Bridge must not be trespassed upon, no matter who does it or for any reason,' said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson.

'In this age of terrorism, it's very important that we protect the security of the bridge at all times and under all circumstances,' he added.

Lesson learned: 'The Brooklyn Bridge must not be trespassed upon, no matter who does it or for any reason,' said Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson 

High security: 'In this age of terrorism, it's very important that we protect the security of the bridge at all times and under all circumstances,' he added

Growing trend: It is the third similar incident at the Brooklyn Bridge in the last four months, in a city highly sensitive to security risks

'This defendant blatantly compromised that security for his own selfish reasons and will now be prosecuted for his foolish and unlawful conduct.'

It is the third similar incident at the Brooklyn Bridge in the last four months, in a city highly sensitive to security risks.

In late August, a Russian tourist, Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, was arrested and charged for climbing to the top of one of the towers supporting the mighty structure to take photos.

Similar story: Russian tourist, Yaroslav Kolchin managed to make it to the top of the 277-foot bridge before authorities arrived to coax him down back in August

Magic act: Two German tourists scaled the bridge and replaced the American flags atop the landmark with white ones back in July this year

And in late July in the middle of the night, two German artists climbed to the top of the bridge to hoist two white flags in place of the US stars and stripes.

The appearance of the white flags prompted a police investigation, which ruled out any terrorist link.

The Berlin-based artists, Mischa Leinkauf, 37, and Matthias Wermke, 35, later claimed the stunt, saying they wanted to honour the beauty of public space.
