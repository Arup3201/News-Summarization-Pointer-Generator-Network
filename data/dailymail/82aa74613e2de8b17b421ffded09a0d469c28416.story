England captain Wayne Rooney should be moved back into a midfield role for Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland, according to Paul Scholes.

The Three Lions struggled to a 1-0 friendly win over Norway on Wednesday, with Rooney scoring the only goal of the game from the penalty spot.

But Scholes, who won 66 caps for his country, believes Roy Hodgson should play his captain in a more withdrawn role when they visit St Jakob Park in Basle.

The former Manchester United star is concerned that England lack a midfield player capable of passing the ball with flair after the retirement of Steven Gerrard, but he sees Rooney as the ideal man to fill that void against the Swiss.

In his column for The Independent, Scholes wrote: 'It is a radical solution, and one I would propose just for the Switzerland qualifier on Monday, but I would play Wayne Rooney in midfield. 

'This is not an argument to say Wayne is not a top striker. His record says that he is and, in an ideal world, I would have two Waynes: one to hit those passes from deep and another to get on the end of them. He is the best passer in the team and he can play that midfield role better than anyone.

'One thing you can be sure about Wayne is that he is not bothered about taking risks. If he saw the pass was on, he would hit it. If it did not work out, that would not deter him from trying it again and again. He would make that pass more often than not.'

Scholes admits that he would prefer not to move Rooney from his preferred role as a striker, but he deems it necessary given the limitations of Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere.

He added: 'Moving Wayne would be a compromise for Roy Hodgson because this England team is not so blessed with goals that it can afford to lose its top goalscorer from the front line. 

'During and after the World Cup I argued for Wayne to be played as a centre-forward but, with these three ahead of him, he could be a huge influence. And he could still make runs into the box.'
