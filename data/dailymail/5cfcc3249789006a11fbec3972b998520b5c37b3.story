Reform: Critically ill patients will be able to benefit from new drugs years before they are approved for general use under new fast-track rules

Patients with life-threatening and serious diseases will be able to get new drugs years before they would normally be available under a Government-backed scheme.

The fast-track plan would help patients with cancers or dementia where there is no effective treatment left from existing medicines.

It will mean drugs can be prescribed on the NHS – paid for by the manufacturer – before they are licensed.

This could mean new medicines become widely available to desperate patients ‘several years’ earlier than under the existing system.

The prostate cancer drug abiraterone, for example, could have been available around two years before it was licensed.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will examine data from ongoing trials in order to approve a drug as a ‘promising innovative medicine’.

It will also need to gain a positive scientific opinion, saying the benefits outweigh the risks, which it is hoped would be granted within two to three months.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the early access scheme due to start next month would boost industry by attracting investment and help patients.

He said ‘This ground-breaking scheme will provide cutting edge medicines earlier, give hope to patients and their families and save lives. And as part of our strategy for life sciences it will create more jobs and opportunities for people, helping secure a better future for our country.’

The plan means medicines will be given to patients before the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has decided whether to approve NHS funding.

Once a drug has been fully licensed for use, it will come out of the early access scheme and be assessed by Nice.

Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said ‘Time is of the essence for many cancer patients, particularly those with more advanced disease. It can mean the difference between life and death.

‘Therefore this scheme, which has at its heart the potential to bring promising new medicines to patients faster, is to be warmly welcomed.

‘The scheme should also make it more attractive for life sciences companies to conduct their development activities in the UK, which will bring a multitude of benefits to the population.’

It is thought anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access.

Although doctors are currently allowed to prescribe unlicensed drugs by taking personal responsibility for a ‘named patient’, the new system will provide confidence to them and patients that the safety risks and benefits have been professionally assessed prior to licensing.

However, the individual doctor would still be liable if anything goes wrong, according to the Department of Health.

Under the plan, pharmaceutical firms will be able to gain experience of how their medicines are being used in the NHS, it said.

Firms would also ‘work closely with regulators to look at the value of the drugs, gaining guidance and advice much earlier in the regulatory process.’

Drug companies would still be able to offer new medicines via trials and on compassionate grounds.

Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said ‘This is a welcome step by the Department of Health towards addressing the lengthy and at times convoluted process of bringing a drug to market.

‘For people with some forms of muscular dystrophy, every day counts and a year could be the difference between walking unaided and using a powered wheelchair, between breathing independently and needing a ventilator to support lungs through the night.

‘The long wait for potential treatments to make their way through three stages of clinical trials can be agonising - particularly when followed by a drawn-out licensing process. We need urgency in the supply of safe and effective treatments to these families.’

Paul Catchpole, director of value and access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said ‘The early access to medicines scheme will benefit patients, the NHS and the UK clinical research community, of which our industry is a part.

‘Most importantly, it means that patients with some life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions - without adequate treatment options - will be able to get faster access to important innovative medicines as these will be made available before launch, following an assessment by the MHRA.’

Dr Ian Hudson, Chief Executive of the MHRA, said ‘We are delighted that the Early Access to Medicines Scheme will be launched in April 2014.

'The scheme is intended to enable patient access to medicines for treatment of life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions where there is an unmet need. This is a major new development in medicines policy in the UK.’
