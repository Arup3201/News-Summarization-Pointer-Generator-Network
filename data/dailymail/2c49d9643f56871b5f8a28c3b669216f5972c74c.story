Respect: The Falkland Islands flag flies at half mast in front of the Visitor Centre after the death of Baroness Thatcher, in Port Stanley on Monday

David Cameron is open to the idea of renaming the capital of the Falklands in honour of Margaret Thatcher, as long as the idea is backed by islanders, Downing Street said yesterday.

The Mail revealed yesterday that senior MPs are suggesting that Port Stanley, also known simply as Stanley, should be renamed Port Margaret in honour of the woman who liberated it in 1982.

They include ministerial aides in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, and Cabinet ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the idea, if it wins the support of the Falklands government.

Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Grainger and former education minister Tim Loughton were among those backing the campaign yesterday, with the latter saying: ‘Count me in.’

There were initial discussions in Number Ten yesterday on ways to commemorate Baroness Thatcher, including renaming the Falklands capital.

‘The Prime Minister thinks it’s a good idea to think of how in due course Lady Thatcher could be commemorated,’ a spokesman said. ‘With regard to Port Stanley, it would be a matter for the Falkand Islands.’

Another Downing Street source said the Prime Minister was open to the proposal but stressed that he believed the views of the islanders had to be ‘paramount’.

Stanley is currently named after Edward Smith-Stanley, who was the British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never actually set foot in the Falklands.

Renaming it after Lady Thatcher would 
infuriate Argentina’s erratic president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, 
who has been upping her rhetoric over sovereignty of the islands around 
the 30th anniversary of the conflict.

But bookmakers offered odds of 5/1 that islanders would agree to bestowing the honour on the woman who many still hero-worship.

Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said he would also like a statue of Lady Thatcher erected in the capital - though some MPs fear it could become the target for Left-wing protests.

Mr Johnson insisted that the former prime minister deserved a ‘prominent’ central London memorial, and refused to rule out using an empty plinth in Trafalgar Square to honour Britain’s only female Prime Minister.

The fourth plinth has never been permanently filled, but since 1998 it has been used to show a series of artworks.

Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘I think it would be very appropriate to
have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London.

'I
haven’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be, but 
certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options.

‘Let’s look at that in slower time, I think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event.’

Commander John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander
on the SS Canberra during the Falklands conflict, said: ‘Let’s have a 
full scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart 
of the nation.

'It wasn’t just the navy that she was a champion of; she was there for all the services. She was a great Briton, let’s put her at the centre.’

Falklands veteran Simon Weston agreed: ‘I think we should celebrate all that she brought back to this country. I think it would be terribly fitting if we could remember her in a similar way to Winston Churchill.’

But he warned a statue could become the focus of protest: ‘I think that you have to be careful of the reaction of the foolhardy, the misled and the misguided who have been popping champagne corks and dancing on her photo.'
