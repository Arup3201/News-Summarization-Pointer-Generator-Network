In a week that has seen Manchester City talk loudly about progress off the field at their new Etihad Campus, it is time for Manuel Pellegrini’s side to make sure they don’t exit the Champions League with a whisper.

City are the Barclays Premier League champions and now boast a training centre — the City Football Academy — that they hope will bring them a steady stream of young talent for years to come. Understandably, they are rather proud of this.

In Europe, though, they continue to play like novices.

This has been a wretched campaign — worse perhaps than anything that has gone before — but one that still has some air in its lungs thanks to two catastrophic Bayern Munich mistakes that led to two superbly taken Sergio Aguero goals late in the game when the teams met in Manchester last month.

On Wednesday evening, at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, City face a task best explained thus: if they avoid defeat, score a goal and better CSKA Moscow’s result in Munich then they will squeeze through to the knockout stages. Anything else and the question marks will begin.

One man who will be missing is Aguero. Pellegrini revealed the Argentine could be out for up to six weeks on Tuesday, while rejecting suggestions another Champions League exit would put his position at the Etihad under threat.

‘Aguero’s recovery will depend on the first weeks,’ explained the Chilean. 

‘It’s an important stage right at the beginning. But, as I said, our team doesn’t depend on a single player and I hope my players can prove it.

‘I think we will qualify but it has nothing to do with my future here,’ he added. ‘I never received any pressure from the club.

‘We started with a target of trying to qualify for the last 16. 

'We have a good squad but made a lot of mistakes in other games, especially against CSKA.

'Against Bayern we showed we are fighting to qualify and I am sure we will do it if we play a good game. It’s very important for the club to play in the next round.’

Wednesday evening is important for City for all kinds of reasons. Qualification for the next stage is important financially, for example.

It also matters in terms of their seeding for next year’s competition but, perhaps most significantly, it is important for the English champions’ self-respect and the manner in which they are viewed around Europe.

If things go right for a team that — to their credit — have used Aguero’s goals against Bayern as a catalyst for improvement, who knows where they may go in this competition?

If things go very wrong, however, they could find themselves without even the consolation of the Europa League place handed to those that finish third in the groups. That scenario would be rather embarrassing.

Despite the absence of Aguero and the suspended Yaya Toure, City are boosted by the possible return from injury of Vincent Kompany and David Silva.

‘It will be a big game for Roma, too,’ said Edin Dzeko. ‘I think the atmosphere will be amazing and that’s what football’s about, and the kind of games we want to play.’

Dzeko is expected to stand in for Aguero and he is in no doubt about the importance of the task.

‘It was a big blow for us to lose Sergio but we have to deal with it and we have won five in a row. There is better confidence, a better atmosphere in the team when you’re winning.

Hopefully we can be even better in the next week. There are some big, crucial games.

‘I’m there when the team needs me and I’m happy to be back,’ the Bosnian added. ‘I’ll do my best to try and score goals and bring something good to the team.

‘It’s a special situation for us in the league and the Champions League because we’ve had to catch up in both. We were eight points behind Chelsea and we knew, OK, now we have to start playing. In the Champions League it has been the same. Maybe we need that pressure.’

Suggesting City’s momentum has been driven by a ‘needs must’ attitude is interesting, though Dzeko’s manager might disagree.

The fact is Pellegrini’s side have improved recently and they have a chance against a Roma team second in Serie A but one that boasts a Champions League record as peculiar as City’s is mundane.

City have been consistently disappointing, while Roma — who won 5-1 at home to CSKA but lost 7-1 in the same venue against Bayern — have oscillated wildly.

Another Manchester team once beat Roma 7-1 in this competition. City would surely take something rather less dramatic.
