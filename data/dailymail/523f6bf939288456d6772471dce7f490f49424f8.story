Doctors in Sweden yesterday said PIP breast implants are dangerous and must be removed.

Tests showed some of the French-made implants contain a type of silicone that irritates tissue, according to the Swedish Medical Products Agency.

Last month, a Europe-wide consumer group warned the chemical may harm babies in the womb.

Removal: Swedish authorities have recommended that the 4,000 women in Sweden with French PIP breast implants should have them removed as a preventative measure

Dr Vendela Schnittger, who led the latest tests, said they raised concerns about long-term safety.

Warning: Women with faulty PIP breast implants are at risk of chemical exposure that causes damage to unborn babies, experts have warned

She added: ‘This is a very young group of people who have been subjected to this health risk.

‘We have no idea of the long-term effects the implants could have.’

The Swedish guidelines contrast with 
Department of Health advice that while PIP implants are more likely to 
split, they do not pose a long-term risk. Other countries to recommend 
routine removal include France, Germany and the Czech Republic.

Rajiv Grover, president of the British
Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said more tests must be 
carried out ‘as a matter of urgency’ on the cheap implants, used by 
50,000 UK women.

A Department of Health spokesman said:
‘The UK regulator keeps all evidence under review and will speak to the
Swedish health authorities to explore the basis for their advice.

‘We expect private clinics to care for patients but, if they refuse, the NHS will look after them.’

The cost of removal in Sweden will have to be met by the women or by their private clinics.

Questions: Lucy Petagine with her daughter, Luna, who lost her battle with cancer last year

When Luna Petagine was diagnosed with
cancer aged just 18 months, her mother, Lucy, was plagued with doubts. 
Had the disease been brought on by something she’d done - or hadn’t 
done?

Was it a phone 
mast or car fumes? Was it something in her genes? What could have caused
her perfect, precious baby girl to be struck down by this vile disease?

Not
for a moment did she consider the answer could lie in an act of vanity,
carried out long before she had children. Twelve years ago, Lucy, 40, 
from Watford, Hertfordshire, paid £3,500 for a breast enlargement 
operation, taking her from a B cup to a D.

Tragically, little Luna succumbed to a
brain tumour last August aged five-and-a-half. Understandably, it has 
left Lucy tortured by guilt, with questions she almost can’t bear to 
have answered.

‘It’s my worst fear,’ she says. ‘If it turned out that I had, through my own vanity, caused my daughter’s death, I would die.’

Lucy, whose husband Mario runs a 
double glazing company, was initially happy with the results of her 
operation. She had been a flat-chested teenager and very slim, and her 
new figure gave her more confidence.

However,
she noticed something wrong with her breasts soon after Luna arrived in
2007. They’d been fine for years and she’d had no problems 
breastfeeding her eldest son Aldo, now eight.

‘But
soon after Luna was born, I’d noticed one of my breasts looked lumpy,’ 
she says. ‘My GP referred me for an ultrasound which showed one of my 
implants had ruptured. But the consultant at the breast screening clinic
said there was absolutely no harm in breastfeeding. He said I should 
come back once I’d finished breastfeeding Luna, to have them removed and
replaced, but I fell pregnant with my third child, Enza, before I 
could.’

Five weeks 
after Enza was born in 2008, Luna became tired and lethargic. At first, 
Lucy and Mario thought it was simply a virus, but then they noticed 
their little girl was sleeping with her head cocked back in a very 
unnatural way. After several weeks of A&E visits and tests, Lucy and
Mario were told that Luna had a brain tumour.

‘For the next year, we spent our lives in hospitals and my breasts were not even thought about,’ says Lucy.

Then
the PIP scandal broke at the beginning of last year. Lucy contacted her
surgeon as soon as she heard the news. He said it was very likely that 
her implants were PIP.

‘I
thought: “Oh my God”,’ she says quietly. She immediately had her 
implants removed and replaced, but at the forefront of her mind was 
Luna’s health. Luna bravely endured chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and four
lots of brain surgery to shrink the tumour. But last summer she began 
to deteriorate. Scans showed the tumour had grown again and was now 
inoperable. Five short weeks later, she died at home with her parents by
her side.

‘People say 
time is a great healer, but unfortunately that’s not true,’ says Lucy. 
‘We have learned to function, but we are never going to be all right.’

‘Cancer can happen to anyone and we 
don’t know if there is a link,’ she says. ‘But I know I had this toxic 
stuff they were pumping into mattresses inside me, and I know it was 
leaking. Could it have passed to Luna through my breast milk? If it does
turn out to cause cancer, I just don’t know what I’ll do.’
