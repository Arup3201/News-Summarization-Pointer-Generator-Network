A former heroin addict who was jailed after he terrified elderly residents at an Essex mobile home park has been given the go-ahead to argue in the highest court in the land that the park landlords have breached his human rights by ordering him off the site.

In a case which will rocket an already hefty legal bill to more than £100,000, three Supreme Court judges have given the green light for Brian Telchadder, 48, to challenge the landlords.

Most of the money funding the case is being paid through legal aid.

The owner of the mobile home site, who has no alternative but to contest the case in the Supreme Court, branded the use being made of legal aid as 'outrageous' and an 'absolute disgrace.'

He is facing legal costs of £50,000 or more which will have to be paid out of his own pocket.

The courts have been told that Telchadder's history includes heroin addiction, issuing death threats to site residents, wandering the Essex woods in camouflage clothing including a masked camouflage hat and has had weapons seized by police from his caravan.

He was jailed for seven days by Colchester Magistrates in 2010 after he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

He opted for prison rather than a fine.

In August 2011, in the light of his behaviour, a judge at Southend County Court terminated his licence to occupy the site leaving him with the option of removing the mobile home or selling it.

That order won the backing of three of the country’s top judges - Lord Justice Mummery, Lady Justice Black and Dame Janet Smith - in the Appeal Court last year.

Telchadder, who estimates he has currently run up Legal Aid bills of around £60,000, had instructed human rights and civil liberties law firm Fisher Jones Greenwood LLP and barrister Lindsay Johnson to argue that he had been discriminated against and his human rights had been breached.

But Lord Justice Mummery, said in his judgment, which was unanimously approved by the other judges, that Telchadder had approached a resident, Brian Carter, with threats to kill him and two other residents.

He continued: 'He threatened Mr Carter with a martial arts stick. He said "I shoot rabbits, I could shoot you."'

The judge added: 'He has a strong interest in martial arts and in weapons, including bayonets and knives, which have been removed by the police.

'He likes to wander in the woods near the site in camouflage clothing, including a masked camouflage hat, which makes his appearance very startling to residents of the site.'

On a later search of Telchadder’s mobile home police found a 'substantial collection of weapons or weapon-like objects was found' the judge said.

In backing the county court judge who paved the way for Telchadder to be evicted, Lord Justice Mummery said that Telchadder suffers from a mild learning disability, autistic traits and an anxiety disorder and has a history of heroin addiction. But he said the county court judge had taken all this into consideration.

He ruled: 'The judge’s conclusion was not a perverse one.'

Telchadder admitted his legal costs are around the £60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected

He said that in view of Telchadder’s ongoing anti-social activities, both before and after he was given notice of the consequences of it continuing, and its detrimental effect on the legitimate rights and interests of the other residents and of the claimant, it was 'difficult to see how the judge could properly have arrived at a different decision.'

Now though, the Law Lords - Lady Hale, Lord Sumption and Lord Reed - have paved the way for a hearing which could stack up a total legal bill of £100,000 or more.

Cases before the Supreme Court are normally argued by top earning QCs.

Telchadder, who was happy to wear some of his camouflage gear this week and pose in it for a photograph, admitted his legal costs are around the £60,000 mark but said his human rights needed to be protected.

He added: 'If I get evicted I would become homeless and have to live in my two man tent and cost the government even more money.'

However, Len Collins, owner of the site, in Little Clacton, who is not legally aided and who has already had to pay out £30,000 in legal costs and anticipates this will go up to £50,000 or more with the Supreme Court hearing said: 'The whole situation where some-one can use public money in this way is an absolute disgrace. It’s outrageous that after him losing in the County Court and the Court of Appeal they are still prepared to fund him in the way they are.

'There is something drastically wrong with a system that allows public money to be used in this way.'

No date has yet been fixed for the Supreme Court hearing but it will probably be next year.
