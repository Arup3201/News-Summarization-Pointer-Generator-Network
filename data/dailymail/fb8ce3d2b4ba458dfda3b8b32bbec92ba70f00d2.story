It looks more suited to the battlefield of Agincourt to protect against the volleys of French arrows.

But this medieval-style chain mail mask is actually a rare survivor of the Western Front of the First World War.

It was worn by the pioneering British tank drivers at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917.

The vehicles, which were still in their infancy as machines of war, were piloted from fume-filled cabins.

And the drivers were often at risk of taking red hot shards of metal in the face as enemy machine gun fire and shells smashed into the exterior.

And so these masks were designed to protect the drivers faces and eyes in the heat of battle.However, very few survived the war.

The face mask is expected to fetch £600 when it comes up for auction at Bosleys, in Marlow, Bucks, on Wednesday.

Tanks were developed during the First World War in bid to break the stalemate of trench warfare.

A prototype vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed by the British company William Foster & Co, during August and September, 1915.

This provided the basis for the Mark I tank that was demonstrated to the Army on February 2, 1916.

Although initially called 'land ships', the vehicles were nicknamed 'tanks' to preserve secrecy after it became known that the factory workers referred to the first prototype as 'the tank' because of its resemblance to a steel water tank.

The heavily shelled terrain around the trenches and in no-man's land was impassable to conventional vehicles.

The Mark I's rhomboid shape, caterpillar tracks, and 26 feet length meant that it could navigate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not.

However, the first tanks were highly unreliable, with a number of mechanical problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit. 

By the time of the battle of Cambrai 
in November/December 1917, the British had already used more than 200 
tanks in Flanders in June and July. The French, meanwhile, had deployed 
large numbers in April, May and October of that year.

But Cambrai was the first time they were used in significant force, with a battleplan especially designed to utilise the new capability

Those deployed by the British at Cambrai were Mark IV tanks and despite initial success, German artillery and infantry defences exposed the frailties of their armour and the vehicles became mostly ineffective after the first day.

Tank design gradually improved in the inter-war period and during the Second World War, where they had once been used to support infantry, the concept of Blitzkrieg made tanks a formidable branch of the army in their own right.

efore the end of the war, tanks had surpassed infantry as the most important force on the battlefield.

The battle of Cambrai started well for the British forces, before they were defeated by a German counter-attack

The Battle of Cambrai proved to be a significant event in the First World War.

The town itself was important because it contained a strategic railhead and was near the Hindenburg Line - the Germans' vast network of defences in northeastern France.

And so, as the battle of Passchendaele was being fought, General Haig approved a plan to take on the Germans by sweeping round the back of Cambrai and encircling the town.

It was the first battle in which tanks were used en masse, with the British deploying a mixture of tanks, heavy artillery and air power - though some in the military did not yet believe that tanks were effective in battle.

Suddenly there was place for mobility on the battlefield - and despite the problems encountered by the British and the Germans speed at countering the threat from the tanks, the nature of the war was changed.

The British plan included an attack on the Hindenburg Line and the use of three cavalry divisions that would encircle Cambrai, thus cutting it off.

While Haig's plan won the approval of some, others were less than inspired that it included tanks as these new weapons had yet to prove their worth in battle in the eyes of some.

The attack started at 6.20am on November 20, 1917 with an intense artillery attack directly on the Hindenburg Line, which surprised the Germans.

Then 350 British tanks began their advance across the ground supported by infantry - both were assisted by an artillery rolling barrage that gave them cover from a German counter-attack. The bulk of the initial attack went well. The 62nd Division (West Riding) covered more than five miles in this attack from their starting point. Compared to the gains made at battles such as the Somme and Verdun, such a distance was astonishing.

However, not everything had gone to plan when a tank crossing the St Quentin Canal broke the bridge that the the 2nd Cavalry Division were supposed to use to advance to Cambrai.

Elsewhere, British units got bogged down in their attack, becoming isolated and seeing the command structure break down.

By November 30, the Germans were ready to counter-attack and defend Cambrai.

This was so effective that on December 3, Haig gave the order for the British units still near to Cambrai to withdraw 'with the least possible delay from the Bourlon Hill-Macoing salient to a more retired and shorter line'.

While losses did not equate to the Somme or Verdun, the British lost over 44,000 men during the battle while the Germans lost about 45,000 men.

The initial phase of the battle did show that mobility was possible in the war but that to sustain it, a decent command structure was needed to coordinate best to take advantage of the situations.

And the failure to build on the initial success of the attack was blamed on the British middle-ranking commanders - some of whom were sacked.
