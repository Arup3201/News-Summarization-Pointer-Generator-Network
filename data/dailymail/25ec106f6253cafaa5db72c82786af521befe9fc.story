Experts have found that dramatic surgery carried out on young epilepsy sufferers to remove half of their brain can give children the best chance at living a life free from seizures.

The rare and dramatic surgery, known as a hemispherectomy, involves surgeons removing, or disconnecting, one half of the brain and a new study has found that the procedure can prevent the seizures.

Scientists reviewed the medical records of patients living with epilepsy and found that after the surgery 56 per cent were left seizure-free.

Of the 115 patients involved in the study another 36 per cent still had seizures but around 15 per cent of them saw a reduction in their frequency of more than 90 per cent.

The study, published in specialist medical journal Epilepsia reviewed the records of patients aged two to 28, most of them children, who had developed epilepsy before the age of three.

Three-quarters of those monitored had daily seizures, while 18 per cent had seizures every week prior to the surgery.

All of those involved in the study had been treated at the specialist unit of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

Head of pediatric epilepsy at the clinic, Dr Ajay Gupta, and his colleagues looked at 186 operations performed at the medical centre between 1997 and 2009, with a particular focus on the 155 patients, as part of the first extensive study to look at the children who have undergone a hemispherectomy.

The researchers were able to confirm what many doctors had already known, despite the fact that there was little data to support the idea that removing the diseased part
of a seizure-prone brain can allow those affected by epilepsy to lead a more normal life.

'The brain has an amazing capacity to work around the function that it has lost,' Dr Gupta told NBC News.

Recovery: Researchers found that nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance after their operations (posed by model)

Only a small number of people with epilepsy are eligable for a hemispherectomy, which involves surgeons either removing half of the brain entirely, disconnecting 
the links between the half in which the seizures were originating from the other side.

Dr Gupta said that doctors at his clinic performed around 15 of the operations every year, and that they were often carried out when anti-seizure medication stops working effectively.

One of the children featured in the study was three-year-old Aiden Gallagher, from Attica, Ohio, who was having more than 12 seizures a day before his operation, after he was diagnosed at just 10-months-old.

His father Pete said the effects the seizures were having on his little son were such that the child had forgotten his alphabet and how to count.

When Aiden turned three his medications stopped working and he started seizing almost constantly, making surgery the only option.

However, since having the operation to remove almost all of the right side of his brain Aiden has not had a single seizure, and is a healthy child who loves playing baseball and basketball.

'I didn’t think the recovery would be anywhere near the point that it is,' Mr Gallagher said.

The researchers discovered that after their operations, 83 per cent of patients were able to walk without aid, and 70 per cent had 
satisfactory speaking skills.

Nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance, and 42 percent of 
children older than six had satisfactory reading skills. 

'Given that if you had not done the intervention most of these kids would be so severely disabled, the results are actually pretty positive,' said Dr Gary Mathern, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.
