David Cameron planted a ceramic poppy at the emotive Tower of London display today as it was announced the popular artwork will remain in the capital until the end of the month. 

The Prime Minister was joined by his wife Samantha as thousands more visitors swarmed the attraction which has drawn in millions since being installed in August. 

His poignant visit comes as it was announced the sea of red ceramic flowers, titled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red by artist Paul Cummins, will remain at the Tower of London until the end of November to allow more people to pay their respects to Britain's war dead. 

To date 888,246 poppies have been planted in the Tower's moat to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI.

Despite a public campaign to make the entire display permanent, a team of 8,000 volunteers will begin dismantling and cleaning the flowers on November 12. 

They will leave two sections, The Wave and The Weeping Window, in place until the end of the month. It will then be displayed across the country in different museums, before being permanently installed at the Imperial War Museum in 2018.  

'I think the exhibition of the poppies has really caught the public imagination, people have found that incredibly moving,' Mr Cameron said today. 

'What we've managed to do is find a way of saving part of the exhibition for the nation and making sure it will be seen by many more people.

'Then it will be permanently saved by the Imperial War Museum - I think the right place for it to be - and something that marks the fact that everybody has found it so moving, so poignant, and such a brilliant idea.

'By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.'

Floodlights have already been installed to allow people to visit after dusk. It comes after overwhelming crowds forced the closure of the nearby Tower Hill Station, with Transport for London pleading with tourists to postpone their visits.

The Camerons are among millions of people to have visited the site since it was unveiled by Paul Cummins earlier this year

An estimated 4million people will have visited the artwork by November 12 since it became open to the public at the start of August  

Politicians pleaded with organisers to keep Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London permanently following the site's popularity. 

An estimated 4million people will have viewed the attraction by November 12, prompting an online campaign with more than 20,000 signatures to stop it being dismantled. 

Adding his weight to the calls, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘I hope that a way can be found to extend this remarkable exhibition, and ensure that many more members of the public get the chance to pay their own personal tributes and see this extraordinary sight.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson is also reportedly in favour of keeping the artwork at the Tower. 

The politician told the Evening Standard this week: 'I’m keen to explore whether we can keep the exhibition open for longer, to give as many people as possible the chance to glimpse something so incredible, whilst easing the pressure on numbers.'

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has not yet visited the attraction, told radio listeners: 'It's really struck a chord, it's extraordinary and very moving to see. 

'Let’s maybe keep the display going a bit longer, but not deprive those charities of that much needed money from the sale of the poppies.' 

The individual poppies have been sold for £25 each to raise money for Armed Forces charities. The tour of sections of the artwork will be funded with charitable donations as well as £500,000 from the Government. 

Chancellor George Osborne also revealed fines paid by banks over the Libor-fixing scandal would be used to contribute to the tour. 

'The Tower of London poppies are a striking reminder of the sacrifice that over 800,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers made to protect our freedom during the First World War, so I'm delighted that £500,000 of Libor fines will be used to ensure that people across the country will be able to see this moving tribute over the next four years,' he said.

'To support the current generation of brave servicemen and women who continue to protect our freedoms every day, we're also using Libor fines to waive VAT on the sale of these poppies, with proceeds going to military charities.

'It's only right that fines from those who have demonstrated the very worse of values should go to support those who have shown the best of British values.' 

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who leads the Government's programme to mark the centenary of the war, added: 'The poppies at the Tower are a stunning memorial to those who died in the First World War.

'I had the honour of being allowed to plant one of the poppies myself and, like the four million or so people who have gone to see them, I was left in awe at the sheer scale and strength of the piece. For me this is public art at its most powerful and moving.'

General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London, added: 'We are delighted that key elements of Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red - the poppies installation at the Tower of London - which has so captured the heart of the nation, are to be preserved for many more thousands of people to see and appreciate over the coming four years.

 'All at the Tower of London and Historic Royal Palaces are most grateful that this wonderful community art project will continue for the next four years.'

Mr Cameron is the latest public figure to make an official visit to the artwork since it was unveiled in August. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured the impressive attraction in August with Prince Harry. 

In her last public appearance before announcing she was pregnant with her second child, the Duchess wiped tears from her eyes as she planted her own flower on August 5. 

The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the Tower on October 16. 

Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard
