Jailed: Jodi Russell, 28, from Dudley, West Midands was sentenced to 20 weeks behind bars for causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs

A mother-of-four who starved her two dogs and left them trapped in urine-soaked cages has been jailed for animal cruelty as a judge called the case 'one of the worst the court had seen'.

Jodi Russell, 28, from Dudley, West Midands, left her pets in such shocking conditions that one died within 24 hours of being rescued by RSPCA inspectors - who discovered the animals 14 months ago.

The dogs were found 'lifeless' in their cages as Russell's children played around them in the living room - and were given the lowest possible condition ratings by vets.

Russell is facing five months in jail after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs and four charges of failing in her duty as owner at Dudley Magistrates' Court in August 2013.

She was also given a lifetime ban from looking after animals or being associated with them in any way after Magistrate Neville Jinks expressed his horror at the case.

Mr Jinks told the court: 'This is one of the worst cases of animal cruelty this court has seen for a very long time.

'I understand you were suffering from emotional difficulties at the time, but this is no excuse for letting the two dogs suffer the way they did.

'I have no choice but to give you a custodial sentence.'

One of the dogs, named Storm, was described by a vet as the thinnest he had ever seen - and it died of starvation within 24 hours of being rescued.

The other - which had been treated the same way - survived and was later re-homed.

The court heard how RSPCA charity inspector Steven Morrell found the dogs starving and in urine-soaked cages in the living room of Russell's home while children played around them.

Daryll Foster, defending, said Russell was suffering emotionally at the time she was looking after the dogs, following the death of her much-loved father and after splitting up with her partner.

He said: 'Miss Russell, in hindsight, now accepts what she has done wrong and realises she should have made steps much earlier and is now a much better person than before.'

Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA spokesman Andy Robbins described the two dogs' suffering as 'shocking'.

He said: 'RSPCA inspectors deal with truly horrific cases of neglect, but it is always upsetting to see animals in such poor condition as these.

'Anyone can see simply from looking at the sorry images presented as part of the case that this was a matter where a shocking level of cruelty had taken place.

'We hope that the court's decision means no other animal will suffer at the hands of the defendant in this case.'

Russell will serve a 20-week sentence for all offences, which will run concurrently.
