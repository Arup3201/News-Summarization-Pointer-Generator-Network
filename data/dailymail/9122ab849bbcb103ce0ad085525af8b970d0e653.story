An obese hospice nurse who has had £30,000 of weight-loss operations funded by taxpayers is so addicted to junk food that he liquidises kebabs and burgers to cheat his gastric band.

Chris McDonnell, of North London, who even blends deep-fried Mars bars to avoid them making him sick, has put on seven stone in a year - and had his band adjusted last month for the eighth time.

The 31-year-old - who has been addicted to eating since he was 12 - revealed his concerns that the addictions of obese patients are often not being addressed, despite them receiving surgery.

He told the Sunday Mirror’s Gemma Aldridge: ‘The problem isn’t in your stomach, it’s in your brain.’

Mr McDonnell said of his food addiction since childhood: ‘I did it without thinking. Huge portions four, five times a day, with several courses. Kebabs, pizzas and burgers were my favourites.

‘Kids would point at me in the street and comment to their parents about how big I was. People told me to diet and I tried - but I just loved food too much. It was the most important thing in my life.’

He weighed a whopping 32 stone at the age of 24 - eating 15,000 calories each day, which is six times the recommended amount for an adult male.

But it was after struggling to fit into an aeroplane seat on the way home from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic that Mr McDonnell realised he had to do something about his weight.

He had been reading on holiday about 
former X Factor judge Sharon Osborne’s gastric band - and went to his GP
 to find out more about having an operation, reported the Mirror.

Mr McDonnell received NHS funding within two weeks for it - which would have cost £9,000 privately - and lost more than half his body weight in the two years following the operation.

After making it down to 15 stone, he was given further operations on the NHS to remove his folds of loose skin - which saw the total cost of his surgery hit £30,000.

But Mr McDonnell was still addicted to fast food, and found himself vomiting small amounts of kebabs he tried to eat. During a four-year period he gained and lost six stone on two occasions.

Doctors have been loosening his gastric band but warning him to stick within a strict diet.

However, he has been unable to do this - and after eating a large amount of blended fast food over the past year in a desperate attempt to digest it, his weight has now soared to 22 stone.

He told the Mirror: ‘You can take the bottle away from an alcoholic but that doesn’t stop him craving booze. I’m always fearing for my future.’

His comments come after the Mail On Sunday reported that post-obesity surgery – which rids weight-loss patients of excess skin – can lead to poor wound-healing and infections.

Researchers from Texas University 
examined the risks of procedures including tummy tucks (abdominoplasty) 
and the full ‘body-lift’ in those who have lost vast amounts of weight.

Thousands of Britons have 'body-contouring' procedures each year. The operations involve cutting away excess skin and fat, and removing and stitching the underlying muscles into a new position.

An overall complication rate of almost 20 per cent was found in a review of 450 individual cases.
