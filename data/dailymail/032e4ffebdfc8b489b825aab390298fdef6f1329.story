Residents who live near the famous Hollywood sign have been accused of trying to stop tourists from reaching the spot by removing it off Google Maps.

Although the Hollywood Sign is clearly visible on Google, once tourists keen to see the landmark asks for directions to it, they are led miles away.

It has now emerged that the directions to the sign have been changed on Google Maps and other GPS services following residents complaints that the number of visitors had become a safety hazard.

Wrong way: Directions to the famous Hollywood Sign have been changed on Google Maps and other GPS services following local residents complaints that the number of visitors had become a safety hazard

For several years, people living in Beachwood Canyon had a steady but manageable flow of tourists, but with the advent of GPS and smartphones, roads started becoming clogged with cars.

Neighbors said the cars parked in the streets were not just a nuisance, but were blocking the narrow roads from access by emergency vehicles.

Residents would demand tourists moved their vehicles and put up signs accusing them of trespassing. 

Following pressure from the residents, local council member Tom LaBonge made a deal with Google and GPS company Garmin to change the directions to the sign, Gizmodo reports. 

When asking Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing, or any search engine for directions to the Hollywood Sign, tourists are given directions to a number of lookout points, instead of to the physical sign.

However, once you ask Google Maps for directions, it guides you to a lookout spot several miles away

Even asking for directions on how to talk to the sign from Lake Hollywood Park, just below the sign, Google Maps suggest a 1.5hour trek to the lookout spot instead of the Hollywood Sign

Garmin confirmed to Gizmodo that the changes were made in spring 2012, while Google said the new directions were part of a November 2014 update.  

The Hollywood Sign Trust, a non-profit organisation which maintains the sign, told Gizmondo that the initial goal had been to 'hide' the sign from the internet.

'At one point we were successful in getting Google to take the address down, but it appears so many other places like the city council offices and the city of LA that they put it back up,' Betsy Isroelit  told the website.

The disappearance of the Hollywood Sign has been highlighted by Gizmodo after one of its writers received abuse from residents after posting an actual guide on how to get to the sign. 

Three years ago, Alissa Walker wrote a guide called 'The best way to see the Hollywood sign', advising tourists not to drive to the sign, but to hike there.

However, following the recent changes on Google Maps, residents in Beachwood Canyon, threatened Ms Walker with legal action if she did not take down the guide.
