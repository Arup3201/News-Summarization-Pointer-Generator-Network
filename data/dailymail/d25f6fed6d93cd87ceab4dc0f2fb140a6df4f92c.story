Smiling for the camera, they appear like any other happy newlyweds, ready to embark on their life together.

But a week after this picture was taken, Jamie Starbuck had killed and dismembered wife Debbie, ready to embark on a £65,000 round-the-world trip paid for with her inheritance.

Starbuck – who brazenly charted his globetrotting adventures in a blog entitled Diary of a Misanthrope – was yesterday starting a life sentence after admitting the murder of his 44-year-old wife.

Mrs Starbuck was last seen  alive six 
days after their wedding  in April 2010. Her body has never been found 
and it is believed that Starbuck killed his wife then dismembered her 
body before burning it at their home.

Judge Michael Stokes QC said it was 
‘one of the most horrific’ murder cases he had dealt with and ordered 
Starbuck to serve at least 30 years before being considered for parole. 
Divorcee Starbuck married Debbie Cooper within nine months of meeting 
her on the internet. They lived in a rented house in Old Basford, 
Nottingham.

The self-employed proof-reader, who had no children, had inherited £150,000 a few years before she met Starbuck.

Murderer Jamie Starbuck visited a total of 32 countries during his 31 month tour including:

Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Poland, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, Indonesia, South 
Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, 
Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Columbia, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico, America, Canada, and finally Peru.

Concerns about Mrs Starbuck’s 
whereabouts were not raised until two years after the wedding when one 
of her friends contacted police to say that he had not heard from her.

Officers discovered her passport had 
expired and that money had been transferred from Mrs Starbuck’s account 
to her husband’s.

He knew her passwords after setting up an online 
account for her.

Detectives were able to prove that her husband spent almost £65,000 of his dead wife’s money to fund his travels abroad.

Starbuck, a one-time amateur 
photographer and cleaner, was arrested at Heathrow Airport in January as
he stepped off a flight from Brazil.

He was found to  have two of 
Debbie’s bank cards in his wallet. An examination of his laptop revealed
a ‘confession’, in which he admitted Debbie’s murder. It read: ‘I had 
planned for it to be quick … I never expected you to be so durable.’

Admission: Jamie Starbuck was jailed for a minimum of 30 years after pleading guilty to killing his wife of six days Debbie and using her money to travel the world

The 36-year-old fled on a one-way 
ticket to Amsterdam within a month of the murder in April 2010. He spent
the next 31 months travelling the globe, sending updates to his wife’s 
family from her own email account to make it appear she was enjoying the
trip of a lifetime.

Bizarrely, he also charted his 
adventures – which took in 32 countries across five continents – in a 
blog which gave no mention of his wife.

In his final post from the Peruvian 
capital, Lima, two days before  flying back he wrote: ‘I am literally 
leaving paradise to face my destiny in England.

'We have learnt that Jamie Starbuck is a 
very controlling man, who engineered a situation to ensure he could 
benefit financially from Debbie’s disappearance'

Det Chief Insp Rob Griffin

‘I left the UK a long time ago in 
search of … well, in all honesty I was running away. From life and 
responsibility; justice and my past.’

He said he had been searching for a 
place ‘where I wouldn’t be judged or condemned for the sometimes 
bafflingly bizarre decisions I make’.

At Nottingham Crown Court, Judge 
Stokes said Starbuck was guilty of a ‘grotesque and inhumane act’. He 
added: ‘On more than 75 homicides, I’m trying hard to think of one as 
horrific as this.

‘This case shows the categories of wickedness are never closed.’

Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, of Nottinghamshire Police said the investigation had been ‘extremely complex’.

Debbie’s sister, Beth Jones, said, 
Starbuck’s deception had been ‘impossible to bear’.

She added: ‘The 
unbelievable and shocking fact that she is dead, has been dead for so 
long and we didn’t even know.

‘For nearly three years we … were 
living with the illusion that she was alive and happy and travelling 
around the world with Jamie.

‘The thought that her bones lay 
scattered, burnt and lonely  on a remote hillside or in a  dark wood 
somewhere leaves us feeling desolate.’

Debbie Starbuck's sister Beth Jones paid tribute to her sister after today's verdict. She said:

'We are heartbroken to lose our beautiful sister and cherished daughter. We are still finding it difficult to believe what has happened and we don’t think that we will ever be able to come to terms with it.

'Deb was bright, adventurous, and full of life. She was kind, loving and loyal and had so many friends who loved her. She was the sort of person who would always go to great lengths to be there when you needed her.

'She was always interested in learning new things and meeting new people. Sadly this led her to meet Jamie Starbuck who took all that away from her.'

'There are so many things about this that are almost impossible to bear. The unbelievable and shocking fact that she is dead, has been dead for so long and we didn’t even know.

'For nearly three years we thought we were communicating with her until, with the slow unravelling of the threads, we knew she could no longer be with us.

'We had no opportunity to say goodbye and no opportunity to grieve. We were living with the illusion that she was alive and happy and travelling around the world with Jamie.

She added: 'Everything that we have been told about what happened to Deb leads us to a place of unimaginable horror. We are haunted and tormented by the suffering that she must have endured in the violent act that caused her death.

'Having no clarity about what happened and where she might be is a cruel and ongoing torture for all of us.

'At the age of 91 our poor father should not have to bear the sorrow of losing a child in this unnatural and devastating manner.

'He has always been a stoical and proud man who survived the death of our mother nearly 14 years ago but he visibly crumpled when DCI Rob Griffin told the ghastly facts of what had happened. He has remained so.

'There could have been some comfort if we were able to find her body and lay her to rest. After what we heard today any hope of that seems futile. The thought that her bones lay scattered, burnt and lonely on a remote hillside or in a dark wood somewhere leaves us feeling desolate.

'Jamie has taken everything from Deb. He has taken her whole life, everything that she was and wanted to be, her hopes and dreams and her chance to be a mother, which she wanted most of all.

'As a family we are now living in a permanent state of bewilderment and anguish.'
