BBC bosses have sparked outrage by broadcasting a historic film presented by a notorious child sex campaigner – and have refused requests to remove it from the internet.

The documentary is presented by Ian Dunn, one of the founders of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned to legalise sex with children.

It is one of 30 archive films on the BBC’s website telling the history of the gay rights movement.

The 30-minute documentary – Glad To Be Gay? – portrays Dunn as a legitimate gay rights activist and makes no reference to his role in setting up the reviled group.

Victims of child abuse described as ‘horrifying’ the decision to upload the film. 

When The Mail on Sunday contacted the BBC to point out the documentary was causing offence, the broadcaster refused to take it down – on the grounds that it is a ‘significant’ work on the history of gay rights. 

The documentary, first shown on the BBC in 1976, shows the lives of gay people at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland, and featured interviews with future Foreign Secretaries Robin Cook and Malcolm Rifkind.

It was an episode of a public access TV series called Open Door, and the BBC website states it was made by the Scottish Minorities Group and credits Ian Dunn as a presenter. 

Dunn, who died in 1998, is shown describing the work of the group in Edinburgh, while Mr Cook and Mr Rifkind were interviewed about their opinions on gay rights.

The footage includes Dunn calling for the age of consent to be lowered, stating: ‘We think a boy considered old enough to take responsibility of bringing up a family is surely old enough to make up his own mind.’

But there is no mention in either the original documentary or on the BBC website of Dunn’s role in campaigning for adults to be allowed to have sex with children.

In October 1974, Dunn had co-founded PIE as an offshoot of SMG, and wrote that its goals were to campaign ‘for the legal and social acceptance of paedophilic love’.

Last night representatives of victims of child abuse said the BBC’s decision was at odds with refusing to show repeats of Top Of The Pops featuring disgraced DJs Jimmy Savile and Dave Lee Travis.

Catherine Allen, of sexual abuse victims’ charity One In Four, said: ‘This is horrifying and shows complete contempt for those who suffered at the hands of Ian Dunn and other members of PIE.

‘I believed the BBC had learned lessons from the Savile saga but they still aren’t taking sexual abuse seriously.’

Dr Jon Bird, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, called on the BBC to remove the film or amend it to make viewers aware of Dunn’s warped views.

The BBC said: ‘This video – which doesn’t involve or discuss any children – was considered a significant programme on gay rights and has been online for many years.’
