These extraordinary pictures show a five-legged cow, whose extra limb is rather bizarrely attached to its neck.

Many believe the four-year-old animal brings good luck to whoever touches the extra limb - with some claiming it is a manifestation of a Hindu deity.

Owner Laxman Bhosale, 35, tours the country with the animal - with hundreds regularly turning out to catch a glipse of the creature.

Laxman said: 'Cow is our holy animal. We call her our mother. With this extra limb, God is indicating to us that we must respect the animal and seek her blessings.

'Touching the limb of mother cow will bring good luck and help you fulfill all your wishes.'

After setting off last July from his home in Solapur, Maharastra, where he owns a cow shelter, Mr Bhosale's journey has seen him visit six states and 15 major cities.

Laxman said: 'People used to come to our house to see the cow. People used to come from far off districts to seek blessings.

'I decided to set out on an all India tour with the cow so that people across the country can see this wonder and take her blessings.

'The cow holds the essence of Hindu religion. I am only trying to further that cause.'

Most people who come to see the five legged wonder pay their respects with some making donations.

Laxman added: 'I passed through the entire length and breadth of Maharastra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

'And everywhere, people welcome the mother cow and enjoy her blessing. Most people wanted to touch the cow's fifth leg.'

Laxman has now arrived in New Delhi, India's capital. But he says it is only a temporary stop.

'I plan to take mother cow around the city for a few days. Then I will take her further down to Mata Vaishno Devi (a holy shrine) in Jammu and Kashmir," he added.

'I want all of humanity to benefit from the blessings of mother cow and her fifth leg.'

Some who visit the cow offer donations while others just come to pay their respects
