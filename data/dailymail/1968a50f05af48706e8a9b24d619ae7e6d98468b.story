Feelunique.com reports that a quarter of its skincare sales are down to the over 50s

With the rise of beauty websites the over 50s are spending more than ever on cosmetics, say experts.

Online retailers have reported a surge in sales among older internet users dubbed Silver Surfers over the past year.

Sales among adults aged 50 to 80 grew more than 210 per cent on the site Escentual.com, with customers spending an annual average of £255 - while 20-somethings only purchased £140 worth of goods.

It's thought the trend is down to Hollywood stars who continue to defy the ageing process.

Last month Cher, 66, posted pictures of her with her mother Georgia Holt, 86,
both looking at least 20 years younger than their age.

And other stars such as Dame Helen Mirren, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kim Catrall and 
Madonna continue to look youthful in their 50s.

Louise Reed, a spokesperson from Escentual.com said: 'There is increasing pressure to keep young and 
beautiful from the media and society in general and this has increased 
as there more and more youthful images of older celebrities.

'A lot of our 
customers are looking for anti-ageing products that slow the appearance 
of facial wrinkles and lines and many are looking for products that turn
back the clock on other specific parts of the body but without the need
for any surgical procedures.'

Unlike other age groups Escentual notes that the over 50s seem to be 'totally unaffected' by the recession and sales have remained constant over time.

In previous years 
expenditure for the older demographic was only around £120 per year.

Feelunique.com, which stocks over 17,500 health and beauty products, has revealed that a quarter of its skincare sales are also down to the over 50s.

Newby Hands, editorial director of the site told MailOnline: 'These women certainly know what works.

'They are an intelligent group of consumers that have invested their time and money in the beauty industry.

'It’s not surprising that  a quarter of our skincare sales are to the over 50s, and hair sales follow closely behind.'
