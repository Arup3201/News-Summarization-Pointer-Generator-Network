The man who callously lured firefighters to their deaths in a blaze of gunfire left a typed up note saying that he wanted to burn down the neighbourhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.'

William Spengler, 62, armed himself with three weapons, including a Bushmaster assault rifle - the same type of weapon used by Sandy Hook Elementary shooter Adam Lanza - and set his house afire to lure first responders into a death trap.

Two firefighters were shot dead and two others are hospitalized. Spengler killed himself as seven houses burned around him Monday.

On Tuesday, it was revealed that a body - believed to be his sister Cheryl Spengler - was found in the charred rubble of his home.

Cheryl, 67, lived with William at the home he 
burned down early Monday in Webster, New York.

A family friend of William Spengler says he 'couldn't stand' his sister and said the two had a difficult relationship.

Police have not confirmed for certain that the charred remains are Cheryl's, but it is believed she died in the house.

Police
 are investigating whether a fight with her sparked the shocking 
violence - which took place just ten days after the elementary school 
shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.

William Spengler has a history of brutality against his family. In July 1980, he beat his 92-year-old grandmother Rose Spengler to death with a hammer. He served 17 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. He was released in 1998.

Authorities believe he used an assault rifle to kill Webster police Lieutenant Mike Chiapperini, 42, and Tomasz Kaczowka, 19, a rookie 911 dispatcher who was best friends with Lt Chiapperini's son.

Spengler, who shot himself dead after a brief firefight with police, is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun in New York.

However, somehow, he was able to obtain an assault rifle - the same type of weapon that was used to murder 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. Police say Spengler also had a handgun.

Roger Vercruysse, who claims Spengler was a good friend when they lived next door in Webster, a Rochester suburb, said Spengler 'couldn't stand' his sister, Cheryl Spengler. Police were unable to locate her since the home she shared with William Spengler was burned down.

Mr Vercruysse said Spengler 'loved his mama to death.' Arline Spengler died in October, and Mr Vercruysse wonders what effect that had on her 62-year-old son. He says he thinks William Spengler 'went crazy' after she died.

Police say they don't have a motive for the killings on the shore of Lake Ontario.

However, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports that detectives believe a fight between William Spengler and his sister Cheryl, whom he lived with, could have sparked the horrific violence.

The victims, Lt Chiapperini and Kaczowka, were public servants who bravely volunteered to be firefighters in their off-hours.

Lt Chiapperini was a community leader who was heavily involved as a volunteer firefighter and had held nearly every post at the fire house. He even trained Mr Kaczowka, who spent three years of high school training in the department's Explorer program.

In addition, two full time fire men, Joseph Hofsetter and Theodore Scardino were shot and wounded by the gunman and are currently in nearby Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, along with John Ritter, an off duty police officer who was hit by shrapnel from the volley of bullets.

Mr Hofsetter, who is also a full-time firefighter with the 
Rochester Fire Department, was hit once in the pelvis and the bullet 
lodged in his spine, authorities said. Mr Scardino was hit in the chest and
 knee.

All three men are in a guarded condition according to West Webster fire Chief Gerald Pickering, who confirmed that there was only one gunman and that it appears the fire was started as a trap.

'It does appear it was a trap set for first responders,' said a visibly emotional Pickering at a press conference this morning.

'These people wake up in the middle of the night to fight fires, they don't expect to get shot.'

Police say Spengler set fire to a car and house to lure firefighters to his house on the shore of Lake Ontario about 5.30am.

When firefighters arrived, he ambushed them and opened fire.

The West Webster 
Fire District learned of the fire early Monday after a report of a car 
and house on fire on Lake Road, on a narrow peninsula where Irondequoit 
Bay meets Lake Ontario, Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said.

The
 fire appeared from a distance as a pulsating ball of flame glowing 
against the early morning sky, flames licking into treetops and 
reflecting on the water, with huge bursts of smoke billowing away in a 
brisk wind.

Two
 of the firefighters arrived on a fire engine and two in their own 
vehicles, Pickering said. After the gunman fired, one of the wounded men
 managed to flee, but the other three couldn't because of flying 
gunfire.

A
 police armored vehicle was used to recover two of the men, and 
eventually it evacuated 33 people from nearby homes, the police chief 
said.

Monday's shooting and fires were in a neighborhood of seasonal and year-round homes set close together across the road from the lakeshore. The area is popular with recreational boaters but is normally quiet this time of year.

'We have very few calls for service in that location,' Pickering said. 'Webster is a tremendous community. We are a safe community, and to have a tragedy befall us like this is just horrendous.'

O'Flynn lamented the violence, which comes on the heels of other shootings including the massacre of 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

'It's sad to see that that this is becoming more commonplace in communities across the nation,' O'Flynn said.Webster, a middle-class suburb, now is the scene of violence linked to house fires for two Decembers in a row.

In the aftermath of the burning fire, 33 residents were evacuated from the picturesque lakeside community as fire chief's allowed the fire to burn unchecked destroying four homes and damaging 4 others.

'All of our thoughts and prayers go to the families and friends of those who were killed in this senseless act of violence,' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.

'The contributions made by the fallen and injured officers in Webster will never be forgotten,' said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

'As this investigation unfolds, we stand with our partners in law enforcement to ensure that lethal weapons are out of the hands of dangerous people, so that the brave New Yorkers who risk their lives every day to protect us are not exposed to additional danger,' he added.

'There's a heightened awareness to this kind of violence in light of 
what happened in Connecticut,' said Maggie Brooks, leader of the local 
administration in Monroe County, the area which includes Webster.

'We have first responders and we have families who are in 
pain and crisis today and we need to, as a community, keep them in our 
thoughts and prayers,' Mrs Brooks said, adding that it was a 'very, very
 difficult day.'

A gunman has reportedly shot and killed two men and injured another two in the town of Webster, New York in an incident this morning

One neighbour who was walking her dog at
 the time of the shooing said that she saw a car driving away from the 
scene at around 90 miles an hour.

She said the car was being driven erratically by a male driver and it is believed that the occupant was fleeing the incident

'It's just a miserable thing to happen this time of year, any time,' 
Assemblyman Mark Johns, who represents the district and said he was 
friends with at least one of the victims, told WHEC.

'People who 
volunteer to come down and help others, to be shot at, wounded, killed. 
It's terrible.'
