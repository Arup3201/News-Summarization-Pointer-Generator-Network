George Zimmerman is selling an original painting on eBay and with several days remaining on the auction, bids on the former neighborhood watch captain’s art had reached $100,000.

The Florida man posted his painting Monday, less than a week after domestic abuse charges against him were dropped when his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe chose not to pursue them.

Mere hours later, bids for Zimmerman’s blue tinted American flag with the words ‘God/One nation/With liberty and justice for all’ had neared an unbelievable six figures.

Troubled: Less than a week ago, Zimmerman saw his most recent charges--of assaulting girlfriend Samantha Scheibe--dropped after she failed to pursue them

‘First hand painted artwork by me, George Zimmerman,’ reads the eBay description, in which Zimmerman reveals his reasons for taking up painting in the hectic months since he was acquitted of charges he murdered unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012.

Despite the firestorm that has surrounded the Sanford man since the acquittal, he even manages to joke about his situation.

‘I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,’ Zimmerman writes. ‘My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors :-)’

According to mynews13.com, Zimmerman’s brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. has confirmed the eBay auction as genuine.

The
 auction began with a starting bid of just $50, but news reports quickly
 fueled a bidding fray that was well past $90,000 with fewer than 100 
bids.

The auction is under the eBay username theRealGeorgeZ and is listed with the subject 'America.'

Bidding is set to continue to December 21.

'My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors :-)' joked Zimmerman on the eBay auction page. 'I hope you enjoy owning this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it. Your friend, George Zimmerman'

Zimmerman's most recent run-in with the law saw him facing charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief following a Nov. 18 confrontation at the central Florida house he shared with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe (pictured)

Samantha Scheibe initially told police Zimmerman pointed a shotgun at her face during an argument, smashed her coffee table and pushed her out of the house but later recanted much of the story

Whoever wins the auction will receive the personally signed, 18-inch by 24-inch oil on canvas via expedited mail from Sanford, Florida at a shipping cost of $40.

Zimmerman ends his description of the painting with a friendly flourish.

‘I hope you enjoy owning this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it,’ he writes. ‘Your friend, George Zimmerman.’

Continued problems: Zimmerman (right, winking at defense attorney Don West) was acquitted last summer of charges he murdered unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (left) when he shot him to death in a Sanford, Florida gated community. He has since been pulled over three times for traffic violations and been accused by his estranged wife of violent behavior in addition to the most recent domestic abuse charges
