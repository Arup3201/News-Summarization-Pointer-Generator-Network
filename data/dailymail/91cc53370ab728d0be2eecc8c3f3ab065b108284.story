Liverpool FC manager Brendan Rodgers was at the home of a female friend when a man battered the front door with a cricket bat.

Rodgers, who today guided the Reds to victory over Norwich and a step closer to the club's first league title in 24 years, was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Charlotte   Hind, 31, the former travel coordinator of the club, when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse.

Mr Rodgers, 41, told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Rodgers to come into the   street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door.

He then jumped back in his car and left.  Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrive, but the man was gone by the time they arrived.  The shocking incident took place on Monday afternoon.

Yesterday a source told The Sunday Mirror: 'Thankfully Brendan has put this behind him and focused on football.'

A neighbour added: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn.

'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.'

Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football.

Rodgers has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat.

The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training   ground.

Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb   of the city for £1.2million.

Ms Hind is divorcing her husband of five years Steven but Rodgers has denied having a relationship with Ms Hind.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm a patrol attended a property in Birkdale on Monday, 14 April following a report of a disturbance.

Officers were called at approximately 5.30pm to a report of a man with cricket bat damaging the front door of a property.

'Officers attended but the man had left the scene. People in the property were spoken to about the incident and they did not wish to make a complaint.'

Mr Rogers met his wife when he was a young player at Reading Football Club and the couple have two children, Oldham Athletic footballer Anton, 20, and   daughter Mischa,17.

He has previously described his wife as 'patient' and 'supportive'.
