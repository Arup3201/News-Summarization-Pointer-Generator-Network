Between issuing chilling threats of nuclear warfare and allegedly launching a cyber attack on a Hollywood studio, North Korea has working on a website to entice tourists to the secretive state - complete with pictures of a ski resort, grinning children... and missiles. 

The site, www.dprktoday.com, provides foreigners with detailed information on the secretive communist nation's tourist attractions, hotels and tour programmess through related stories and video clips.

The North has a few other propaganda sites for outside online users like Uriminzokkiri  and Naenara. But the new website focuses more on attracting foreign tourists, reports South Korean news agency Yonhap.

Spot of relaxation: Pictures showing the myriad entertainment options in the dictatorship

The Masikryong ski resort, built on top of Taehwa Peak, near the port city and naval base Wonsan, opened for business earlier this year and hopes to bring 5,000 visitors a day

The resort boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes

The sprawling 1,400-hectare resort was built in just ten months as part of a push by leader Kim Jong-un to increase overseas tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016

The North's media said the website has been created to 'satisfy growing interest and expectation' over the nation.

It features pictures and info about the nation's food, culture, beaming children and even information on North Korea's national bird (the Chollima, a mythical winged horse).

However, as a chilling counterpoint to the cheery pictures, the website also features images and articles about its missile programme.

It also offers specific flight schedules from Beijing, Vladivostok and several other foreign cities to Pyongyang as well as a list of various package tour programmes and information on luxury hotels.

The pictures include communist enclave's one and only ski destination, on top of Taehwa Peak, which boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is keen to draw tourists to the 'Hermit Nation'

Co-sponsored by more than 60 countries, the resolution drew heavily on the work of a UN inquiry which concluded in a 400-page report released in February that

North Korea was committing human rights abuses "without parallel in the contemporary world."

The year-long inquiry heard testimony from North Korean exiles and documented a vast network of harsh prison camps holding up to 120,000 people along with cases

of torture, summary executions and rape.

North Korea reacted angrily to the vote and announced that it was breaking off talks on improving human rights with the European Union, which drafted the resolution with Japan.
