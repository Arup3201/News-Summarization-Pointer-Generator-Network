A woman who made history as the first to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) on live television 16 days ago, has announced that she is pregnant.

Jessica Menkhausen, 33, from St Peters, Missouri, told the Today show this morning that she is 'ecstatic' about the prospect of motherhood, after years of struggling to conceive.

'In the next few weeks we'll do an ultrasound and by that time we'll be able to hear the baby, or babies', heartbeats and hopefully see one or two fetuses in the womb,' she revealed.

Parents-to-be: Jessica Menkhausen, who made history as the first to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) on live television, has announced that she is pregnant - her fiance Derek Manion says he feels 'overwhelmed'

She says that her fiance, Derek Manion, has already started to pick out names for their child.

While he would like a boy, or boys, Miss Menkhausen would love to have a boy and girl, because it would be 'the best of both worlds'.

On September 24 she was filmed by Today under anesthesia, as eggs were harvested from her ovaries by ultrasound guidance at St. Luke's Hospital, Missouri.

NBC's Dr. Nancy Snyderman said from inside the operating room: 'Right now Dr Sherman Silber is inserting a micro needle with a little suction into the ovary and each of these black sacks you see really houses an egg. They're being sucked out and being examined behind us.'

Viewers were then told how Miss Menkhausen's eggs would be 
transported to the laboratory where her fiance's sperm would be 
injected into them to start the fertilization process.

Three days later, three 'good embryos' were transferred back into Miss Menkhausen's uterus.

Pre-surgery, Miss Menkhausen said that 
she wanted to share her journey through fertility treatment to 
'enlighten other women who are having the same challenges.'

'I know that the next three months are a 
very critical time period for the pregnancy, so no more fast food for 
me'

'Itâ€™s also a form of 
self-enlightenment - sharing my story is helping me deal with some of my
own fears, by courageously facing them head on.'

She
had battled fertility issues since a teenager. Every month she would 
experience 'excruciating' menstrual cramps and went on to suffer
two ectopic pregnancies in her twenties.

'It took years to get over,' she said. 'I was really glad when we met Dr Silber, he gave us so much hope.'

To
pay for the procedure, which can cost up to $17,000 per cycle, she and 
Mr Manion have been forced to put their wedding on hold until next year.

Before getting her eggs harvested Miss Menkhausen went through four weeks of pretreatment at St Luke's Hospital.

This
saw her be injected with drugs to suppress her natural hormonal cycle and 
take daily hits of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) to stimulate 
the production of eggs.

'Despite
the roller coaster, I know that the first time I 
hear our baby cry, it will be well worth what we have gone through'

Throughout the drug treatment, her progress was monitored via ultrasound scans and blood tests.

The Missouri-based couple said they were determined for their IVF to work first time around, as they used their savings to pay for the procedure and cannot afford another cycle.

Maintaining a positive attitude 
throughout, Miss Menkhausen, who works as an accountant, said before 
learning she was pregnant: 'I want to be positive and I think we're 
going to have twins and they're going to have red hair and blue eyes. 
That's what we have to keep thinking.'

'Despite
the hormone roller coaster, bruising from injections, and the constant 
"what-if" analysis going on in my head, I know that the first time I 
hear our baby cry, it will be well worth what we have gone through.'

High hopes: Miss Menkhausen says that she thinks she's going to have twins and with red hair

She and Mr Manion, received a telephone call from Dr Silber this week telling them their IVF had worked.

Miss Menkhausen said that she hopes to show her children the televised recording of her IVF treatment one day, to show them how much we wanted them.'

She added: 'I know that the next three months are a 
very critical time period for the pregnancy, so no more fast food for 
me.

'Ultimately were are praying for a safe pregnancy and healthy babies . . . This whole process has been an amazing journey for both of us.'
