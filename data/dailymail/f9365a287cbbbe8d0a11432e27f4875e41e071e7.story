France's World Cup preparations face a major blow with news that star midfielder Franck Ribery could miss this summer's showpiece due to injury, according to reports in France.

The 31-year-old has an ongoing back problem that has plagued the Bayern Munich ace for most of last season.

Ribery, who made just 18 Bundesliga 
starts for the German champions, missed his nation's 4-0 warm-up victory
 over Norway at the Stade de France on Tuesday.

However, he has been named on the bench ahead of Les Bleus' friendly against Paraguay on Sunday night.

Speaking on Saturday about Ribery's fitness, France coach Deschamps was hopeful that he would travel to Brazil.

‘Backache, it means everything and nothing,' he said.

'I do not go into the medical field, but we will do everything to get him back in the best conditions.’

France's 1998 World Cup winning left-back Bixente Lizarazu also voiced his concern over Ribery.

'We're worried about Franck Ribery because we don't know what he has,' he told French reporters.

Deschamps'
 side begin their World Cup campaign in Group E against Honduras on 15 June, before
 facing Switzerland five days later and Ecuador on 25 June.
