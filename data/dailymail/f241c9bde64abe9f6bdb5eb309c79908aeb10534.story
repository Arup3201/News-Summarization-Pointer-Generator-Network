Boston residents have kept their sense of humor despite facing record snow falls over the past month, closing the city and causing travel chaos. 

With snowdrifts several feet deep across the New England area, some residents have seen their entire houses buried. 

In some areas, more than eight feet of snow has fallen, with even deeper snow drifts being caused by strong winds.

Some parts of the city has seen 96 inches of snow over the past 30 days, which was prompted some locals to risk their lives in a range of hair-brained stunts.

The city's Mayor Martin Walsh has warned people against jumping from windows into massive piles of snow.

Walsh has publicly scolded those filmed participating in the jumps, saying: 'This isn’t Loon Mountain. This is the city of Boston.'

Speaking at a press conference, Mr Walsh added: 'It's a foolish thing to do. And you could kill yourself. So I'm asking people to stop the nonsense.

'The last thing we want to do is have to report to an emergency call where somebody jumped out the window because they thought it was funny.' 

And the chilly weather is not over just yet - with another deep freeze due to strike large swathes of the US on Wednesday. It will last until the weekend.

'On the heels of Winter Storm Octavia, temperatures will plunge once again in the central and eastern United States,' the Channel said on its website.

'This latest reinforcing shot of cold air arrived in the Upper Midwest on Tuesday. From there, it dives into the South and spreads east'.
