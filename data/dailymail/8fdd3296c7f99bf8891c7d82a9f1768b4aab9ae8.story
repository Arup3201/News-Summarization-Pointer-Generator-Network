A university is under fire after a class assignment instructed its students to write the word 'Jesus' on a piece of paper, throw it on the floor and then stomp on it.

Florida Gov Rick Scott has now demanded an investigation into the ‘offensive’ assignment after a Florida Atlantic University professor allegedly threw a student out of his class for refusing to participate.

Ryan Rotela, a junior at FAU’s Davie campus who describes himself as a devout Mormon, says it was his refusal to participate that led to his suspension.

Assignment: Ryan Rotela, a junior at Florida Atlantic University, says his intercultural communication professor instructed him to write the word Jesus on a piece of paper like seen here

Refusal: After her wrote it down he was then told to place it on the floor and then stomp on it, an act he says he refused to do, leading to his suspension

'Anytime you stomp on something it shows that you believe that something has no value. So if you were to stomp on the word Jesus, it says that the word has no value,' Mr Rotela told CBS12.

The assignment instructed in Dr. Deandre Poole's intercultural communication class was meant to demonstrate the power of words and symbols, according to the exercise.

'This exercise is a bit sensitive, but really drives home the point that even though symbols are arbitrary, they take on very strong and emotional meanings,' the exercise taken from St. Norbert College communications professor Jim Neuliep reads.

'Most will hesitate. Ask why they can't step on the paper. Discuss the importance of symbols in culture.'

Mr Rotela said he went to speak with his professor's supervisor two days after, and found himself suspended.

Threatened: Mr Rotela, who describes himself as a devout Mormon, says that after he returned with an attorney from the Texas-based Liberty Institute his school apologized

Apology: The university has since apologized calling the assignment insensitive and unacceptable, just before Florida Governor Rick Scott got into the matter demanding an investigation

He says his argument was first rebutted by the school.

'While at times the topics discussed may be sensitive,' Communications Department Director Noemi Marin said last week according to UPI, 'a university environment is a venue for such dialogue and debate.'

It was after Mr Rotela returned with an 
attorney from the Texas-based Liberty Institute that he says the school 
changed its tune.

FAU'S Dean of Students Cory King told him last week that any disciplinary charges would be dropped, according to Mr Rotela.

'He apologized in person for what happened and how everything went out of control,' Mr Rotela told the Palm Beach Post.

In a statement later released on the university's website, the school called the assignment 'insensitive and unacceptable' while noting it having been written by a professor unaffiliated with FAU.

'Based on the offensive nature of the exercise, we will not use it again and have issued an apology to the community. It was insensitive and unacceptable. We continue to apologize to all the people who were offended and deeply regret this situation has occurred,' the statement reads.

'No students were forced to take part in the exercise; the instructor told all of the students in the class that they could choose whether or not to participate. No students will be disciplined in any way related to this exercise, either inside or outside the classroom.'

On Tuesday Gov Scott showed that their apology may not be enough.

'I am requesting a report of the incident, how it was handled and a statement of the university’s policies to ensure this type of "lesson" will not occur again,' he wrote to State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan.

Gov Scott says he later called Mr Rotela personally to discuss the matter.

‘I told him that it took great conviction and bravery to stand up and say what he was asked to do was wrong, and went against what he believed in,’ Scott told the Sun Sentinel.
