After 112 years, a stint as a summer house, and a home for pet mice, this horse-drawn tram will soon be carrying passengers for the first time since the Victorian era.

The double-decker 'Leeds horse car 107', built in 1898, has been painstakingly renovated after more than a century out of use.

The tram, which was being used as a garden summerhouse until the 1970s, was transformed back to its former glory by 10 volunteers from the Leeds Transport Historical Society (LTHS).

This Leeds horse drawn tram was built in 1898 and ended life as derelict summer house. It has now undergone a painstaking renovation to restore it to its former glory

The car ran until 1901 when a new bridge was opened to road traffic and the electric cars were able to run

It took the team eight years to get the contraption, which went out of service the year Queen Victoria  died, running again.

Now their meticulous restoration is going on display over the Bank Holiday weekend where horses will be used to carry passengers for the first time since 1901.

The tram, which carried 34 passengers along the tramways in Leeds, West Yorkshire, was shut down when a new bridge was opened to road traffic before being carefully converted to a static mess hut for the council Highways Department.

In the 1920s, the carbody was declared redundant by the Highways Department and was given to a council employee for use as a summerhouse.

It was then moved to a garden in the East End Park area of Leeds.

At one point, the owner's nephew and his wife lived in the car until the 1970s.

It was fitted out with a stove and given several coats of paint to keep it weatherproof.

The house then changed hands and the Wilson family became the owners. Their sons used the car as a home for their collection of pet mice.

The car body was seen by LTHS member Alex Brown and was identified as the last remaining Leeds Horse Car.

The Society negotiated with the Wilsons who generously donated the car to the Society.

The labour of love was initially salvaged by the society in 1977, and the car was then placed in a garage, where it stayed for another 28 years.

The 20ft long and 7ft tall tram, which cost £45,000 to restore to its former glory, will go on display at Middleton Railway in Leeds

Project manager Jamie Guest, 60, of Leeds, said: 'It's quite a momentous occasion - it's the last remaining Leeds horse tram.

'The bodies of other trams would have been sold off as storage sheds and the scrap metal recycled.

'When
I first saw it at the back of a garage covered in blue paint as just a 
shed, even then I felt it wanted something doing to it.

'So to see it now as a fully restored vehicle capable of carrying passengers again after 112 years is brilliant.'

The 20ft long and 7ft tall tram, which cost £45,000 to restore to its former  glory, will go on display at Middleton Railway in Leeds before heading to its final destination at the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire.

Andrew
Gill, chairman of the the Middleton Railway Trust, said: 'The piece of 
railway track it will run on is only about three or four metres away 
from the original Middelton tram, so we are recreating history almost on
the original tramline.'

The
Festival of Transport on the Bank Holiday weekend will also feature 
traction engines, displays, real ale, hot food, workshops and the chance
to drive one of the railway's locomotives for £5.
