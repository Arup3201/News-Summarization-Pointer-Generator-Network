To prepare for the release of two female giant pandas into the wilderness later this month, Chinese caretakers are dressing in panda suits to help draw the animals out of their enclosure.

And while it might seem like an extreme length to go to, researchers believe that using such costumes are vital for teaching the animals to survive in the outside.

According to scientists, the outfits are crucial to ensure that the bears do not become used to seeing humans.

This will be the second attempt to release the pandas into the wild, following a failed try in October, according to the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP) in China's Sichuan Province.

Two-year-old Xin Yuan and her mother will soon be released again, in hopes that she will learn to fend for herself.

Caretakers, in fancy dress, have been helping her learn habitat selection, foraging, and enemy evasion skills.

Scientists hope to repopulate the species by breeding them artificially and then introducing them into the wild

During the first unsuccessful release, chronicled in the video, keepers in panda suits approached Xin Yuan, but found that she was reluctant to leave and quickly climbed a tree to get away.

China first began sending captive-bred pandas into the wilderness in 2006 with the release of five-year-old male Xiang Xiang. Unfortunately, he was killed by wild pandas a year later.

Scientists believe that the other bears sensed something different about the human-reared Xiang Xiang.

In October 2012, male panda Tao Tao was successfully released into the Liziping Nature Reserve and in November 2013, female panda Zhang Xiang also successfully transitioned to the wild. 

A 2007 report estimates that there are only 1,590 giant pandas living free in China, and conservationists are desperate to find ways to repopulate the species.
