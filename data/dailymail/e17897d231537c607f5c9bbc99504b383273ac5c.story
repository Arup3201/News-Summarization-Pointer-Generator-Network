Supermarket giant Morrisons has been forced to apologise to a mother after asking her to go breastfeed her baby in the disabled toilets.

Michelle Garner, 31, was stunned when staff at a the store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, told her she should feed her six-week-old daughter Lois in the supermarket loo.

The mother-of-two said she was shopping with her baby when she approached a senior member of staff.

Shocked: Mother-of-two Michelle Garner, 31, was asked by a Morrisons' staff member to breastfeed her six-week old daughter, Lois, both pictured, in the disabled toilets

After asking if there was somewhere suitable to feed her baby she was advised by a staff member to use the disabled toilet.

When she got there, albeit reluctantly, Mrs Garner found there was not even a toilet seat in the 'grubby' and 'dirty' cubicle and stormed out of the store in tears.

She said she was left feeling like an outcast following the 'humiliating' incident and stormed out of the store.

She said: 'I was really upset. I felt like an outcast and really embarrassed.

'There wasn’t even a lid on the toilet, it was dirty and very grubby.

Controversial: Staff at the Morrisons in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., said Mrs Garner could use the disabled toilets to feed her baby. The supermarket giant has since apologised

'I would have breastfed in the cafe, but the chairs are welded to the tables and there just wasn’t enough room.

'The staff were short with me, and it really made me feel upset.

'So I went and sat in the car. It really upset me and I felt completely humiliated.'

Michelle who also has a 12-year-old son, said she could not understand why Morrisons could not offer breast feeding facilities while other supermarkets could.

Her husband Bryan, 34, added: 'Post natal depression is one thing I’m very aware of and it’s incidents like this which can trigger bad feelings in mums.'

To vent her frustration she took to 
Facebook and complained about what had happened to her on a local 
breastfeeding mums network page.

She
was met with so much support that a group of a dozen mothers visited 
the store yesterday afternoon to publicly breastfeed their children in 
protest.

Complain: Mrs Garner wrote about her ordeal on Facebook and garnered support from a group of local mothers who went to the store and breast-feed in reaction

One mother Claire Bradford, 37, of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, who fed her two-and-a-half-year old son Charlie Moore at the store, said: 'It’s disgraceful what has happened to Michelle, and we shouldn’t stand for it.

'They were in the wrong and they need to change their policy.'

A Morrisons spokesman said they were sorry for what happened, adding the the options offered to the customer were 'not good enough'.

They said: 'We welcome mums and their babies in our store and we know that it’s important to offer every assistance to make them comfortable.

'We will be ensuring that all colleagues at the store understand what support we expect them to offer breastfeeding mums.'
