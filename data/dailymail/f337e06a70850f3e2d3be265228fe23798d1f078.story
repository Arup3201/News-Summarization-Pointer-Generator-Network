Bad deal: Phoenix man Walter Earl Morrison has been charged with stealing a diamond worth $160,000 and trading it for a bag of marijuana worth twenty dollars

A Phoenix man has been charged with stealing a diamond worth $160,000 and trading it for a bag of marijuana worth twenty dollars.

Walter Earl Morrison, 20, was working for UPS at Phoenix Sky Harbor when police say he swiped a package.

Inside, Morrison allegedly discovered the jewel where he expected to find cash.

Evidently, Morrison found himself at a loss as to what to do next, or possibly with a powerful desire to get stoned.

Whichever it was, Morrison allegedly swapped the gem for ganja before police honed in on him.

The diamond was soon recovered, as well, and delivered to its owner, reports KNXV.

Police charged Morrison with felony theft.

He's since been fired from his job with UPS. 

Morrison's alleged heist, while large by many standards, is puny compared to some of the jewel thefts of recent memory.

Wearing a scarf to mask his face, a gunman sneaked into the posh Carlton hotel in Cannes, France and held up a diamond show as three security guards looked on, then fled on foot about a minute later.

 In the end, he made off with a breathtaking $136 million worth of valuables — the biggest jewelry heist in years, maybe ever.

Back in May 2013, 31 were arrested on charges they helped rob a shipment of diamonds worth $50 million from the Brussels airport.

And just this month, an extremely rare diamond worth at least $577,000 was snatched from a Sydney auction house.

The pink argyle and white diamond band was on a display counter at Theodore Bruce Auctions in Alexandria when it went missing. 

Morrison was working on a UPS cargo plane when he allegedly swiped the gem. He's since been let go by the company
