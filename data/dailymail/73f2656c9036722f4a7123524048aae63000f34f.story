Andy Murray stormed through to the last 16 of Wimbledon last night – but then moaned that his family had snubbed him in victory.

After his straight sets victory over Roberto Bautista Agut on Centre Court, he complained that they had opted to watch his elder brother Jamie who was playing a doubles match at the same time.

Apparently joking, he said: ‘It’s a shame. We were on at the same time.  None of my family came to watch me, so I’m always the number two son.’

Andy Murray soared through to the fourth round of Wimbledon with a convincing straight-sets win over Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut

When told that his mother Judy had 
actually made it back for the end of his match he added: ‘Yeah, but my 
brother is the priority.  He’s number one son, so he’s always had the 
preference.  That’s why I’m so competitive since I’ve been a kid.  But 
yeah it’s good that we both won.’

While
 his dry and droll delivery means his humour isn’t always very obvious, 
some observers were reminded of the old saying about many a true word 
being spoken in jest.

And 
experts who have seen his development from a young age have noted that 
his fierce rivalry with his elder brother was a key factor in the 
extraordinary drive he possesses.

It was evident yesterday as he cruised to victory in his third round clash.

The win takes him though to the last 16 and keeps his dream of a second Wimbledon title alive.

The Scot never looked troubled by number 27 seed Agut, leading fans to shout: ‘Murray’s in a hurry.’

The match was his most serious challenge yet after two straight sets victories in the opening rounds.

But
 faultless Murray, 27, showed no concerns as he outpowered the Spaniard 
almost from the start, to win to win 6-2 6-3 6-2 in barely an hour and a
 half.

Instead it was his 
26-year-old opponent who appeared increasingly irritable, smashing the  
ball into the net after losing  one point.

Murray’s
 impressive second-round performance on Wednesday helped the All England
 Club attract 43,680 fans – an increase of 2,537 compared with the same 
day  last year.

A club spokesman said this was because fans supporting the Scot left after his win.

This meant that thousands snapped up tickets through the resale kiosks.

Dozens turned out to Wimbledon in fancy dress - including these six who donned masks of Andy Murray

Day five of the competition saw one of the biggest crowds yet gather on Murray Mount, which sits behind Court 1 at Wimbledon, to support the British Number 1

After last year's title and the Olympic success in 2012 Murray is now on a 16-match winning streak at Wimbledon.

He will now face 2.03-metre tall South African Kevin Anderson, who beat Italian Fabio Fognini.

Murray said: 'He's a big guy with a big serve, so I'll have to be sharp for that one.'

His third victory comes after impressive performances earlier this week against David Goffin and Blaz Rola in his first two rounds.
