Hoax: Dean Richard Kelly called police saying a woman with a shotgun was outside his flat

A dwarf has admitted making a drunken hoax 999 call that brought three armed response teams rushing to his home.

Dean Richard Kelly, 37, a silver medallist at the World Dwarf Games, phoned police at around 3am on January 11 and reported a woman with a shotgun and a knife outside his flat in Barrow, Cumbria.

He was yesterday given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after pleading guilty to wasting police time.

Three armed response teams, a police dog handler and seven police officers were sent to Kelly's home on Harrison Street, along with a sergeant and inspector, Furness Magistrates’ Court heard.

At around 4am, Inspector Carl Patrick sent the teams back to base after realising the call was a hoax - taking police away from Barrow's busy town centre just as a number of nightclubs were closing.

The North West Ambulance Service also attended, with the street sealed off throughout the incident.

Prosecutor Peter Kelly said: 'This was considered a serious waste of police resources with potential to compromise police ability to deal with incidents.. He wasted 20 hours and 50 minutes of police officers’ time and two hours of staff time.'

The solicitor told the court how the incident had cost police £540 on top of operational costs.

Kelly initially denied making the call until police played him a recording of the phone call.

The court heard he had been drinking but was not 'overly' drunk.

Mr Trystan Roberts, defending, said: 'It's clear this type of behaviour is out of character for this defendant... He can’t really explain why he did this.'

'He says it’s disgusting and he’s ashamed of it - he’s grateful that the police were not taken away from a serious incident,' Mr Roberts added.

Kelly was given a 16-week suspended jail term, ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, told to pay £540 compensation to Cumbria police, £85 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

A spokesperson for Cumbria Police said after the hearing: 'Cumbria Police deal with a vast amount of calls for service each day.'

'Anyone making malicious or hoax calls can put others at risk by detracting away from those who are in genuine need of the emergency services. We will aim to take action against those who make hoax calls and waste the time of the emergency services,' they added.

Kelly refused to comment.

In August last year Kelly won four silver medals, including the 100 metre sprint, at the World Dwarf Games in Michigan, USA. The Games are an Olympics-style sporting competition organised every four years by the Dwarf Athletic Association of America.
