Curiosity has sent back the first pictures of the Martian rock dust it collected after successfully drilling down into the surface of the Red Planet.

Images released today by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, show for the first time that powdered rock sample has been transferred to an open scoop.

Nasa says it is the very first time anyone has drilled into a rock beyond our home planet and collected a sample from its interior.

The U.S. space agency's Mars Science Laboratory Project is using the Curiosity rover to investigate whether an area within Mars' Gale Crater was ever hospitable to microbial life.

They hope to now use Curiosity's on-board scientific instruments to analyse the pulverised rock sample in an effort to learn more about the site's environmental history.

Curiosity drilling engineer Scott McCloskey said: 'Seeing the powder from the drill in the scoop allows us to verify for the first time the drill collected a sample as it bore into the rock.

'Many of us have been working toward this day for years. Getting final confirmation of successful drilling is incredibly gratifying.

'For the sampling team, this is the equivalent of the landing team going crazy after the successful touchdown.'

Sample preparation: The 150-micrometer sieve which will be used to remove larger particles from samples before delivery to science instruments

The drill on Curiosity's robotic arm collected the powder as it bored a 2.5in hole into flat Martian bedrock on February 8.

Researcher will now instruct Curiosity to sieve the sample and deliver portions to its analytical instruments.

The scoop holding the precious sample is part of Curiosity's Collection and Handling for In-Situ Martian Rock Analysis (CHIMRA) device.

The next step is to enclose the power inside CHIMRA and shake it over a sieve to screen out any particles which are larger than 0.006in (150 microns) across.

Holy holes on Mars! Nasa's rover Curiosity drilled a 2.5in-hole hole on February 8 to take its Martian planet sample - next to it is a shallower hole where the rover conducted its test drilling

Small portions of the sieved sample later will then be delivered through inlet ports on top of the rover deck into the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument and Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument.

The sample comes from a fine-grained, veiny sedimentary rock called "John Klein," named in memory of a Mars Science Laboratory deputy project manager who died in 2011.

The rock was selected for the first sample drilling because it may hold evidence of wet environmental conditions long ago.
