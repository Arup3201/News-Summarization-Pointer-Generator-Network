A silver tabby cat who fell asleep on top of a warm fuel tank woke up more than 100 miles away after a terrifying journey clinching to a moving coach.

The animal, nicknamed Diesel by the National Express workers who found him, curled up on top of the coach's fuel tank while it was parked overnight in Westward Ho!, Devon.

But when the driver started the coach for the 8.45am service to Grimsby it was too terrified to move - and stayed until the coach came to a stop in Bristol.

Survivor: Diesel the cat clung to the coach's engine for 100 miles

Hiding place: Coach driver Andy Musket found Diesel and coaxed him out

Driver Andy Muskett heard the meowing cat as he was unloading customer’s luggage.

Passengers were transferred onto another coach to continue the journey to Grimsby, while Mr Muskett attempted to coax the cat out.

He called engineer Andy Teagle for help and the pair managed to persuade the tabby to come out from under the coach.

The cat does not have a collar or microchip, so staff named him themselves and took Diesel back to the depot to be fed.

Mr Muskett said: 'I heard a strange 
noise that was definitely not mechanical and realised that as only one 
thing meows we probably had a cat incident.

'It
 was still a bit of a shock to find a silver tabby cat sitting on the 
fuel tank. When we got him down he was actually pretty contented.

Care: Diesel, above left with nurses and right with an RSPCA collection officer, was fed and cared for. The RSPCA is now looking for his owners

Voyage: Diesel travelled 100 miles underneath the coach from Westward Ho! to Bristol

'He must have been looking for somewhere warm to sleep and crawled under the coach when it was parked up overnight, and was probably too frightened to move when it started in the morning.'

Diesel is now in the care of the RSPCA, who are trying to locate his owners. They have put out a missing notice to all of the local vets' offices.

Julie Parson, animal collections officer for the RSPCA, said: “We are delighted staff at National Express were able to get Diesel out from such a tricky location.

'We think Diesel may have got into the engine as it was a warm place to sleep. When we checked him over we realised he is suffering from some burns and he is currently on antibiotics. Fortunately he is now recovering well at one of our clinics in Bristol.

'Although he is skinny, he is very friendly so we think he has an owner who is probably missing him.'

Anyone with any information about Diesel is asked to call the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
