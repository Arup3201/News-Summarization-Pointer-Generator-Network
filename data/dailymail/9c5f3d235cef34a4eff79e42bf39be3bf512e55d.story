Clive Palmer has hit out at a journalist who dared ask a question about the fraud allegations against him, telling him to ‘think’ for himself.

Mr Palmer attacked Courier-Mail correspondent Steven Scott while speaking at a Press Club lunch in Canberra after Scott tried to quiz him about a ‘fraudulent and dishonest payments’ court case he is embroiled in.

The 60-year-old businessman is accused of misusing $12 million from two Chinese-owned companies and the case is currently before the Supreme Court of Queensland.

Mr Palmer refused to allow Mr Scott to ask questions shouting ‘no,no,no’. ‘Why don’t you try to be an independent journalist?,’ he blasted.

‘I'm not going to let him get his question out. I'm not going to take that rubbish,’ he fumed.

'Have some guts to Rupert, don’t do what he tells you from New York... Stand up and be a journalist. Don’t read off that, think off your own brain and think of a question,' he raged.

The PUP Leader attacked the Courier-Mail newspaper and its cartoons as a ‘national disgrace to journalism’.

A journalist at The Saturday Paper, Sophie Morris, stuck up for Scott and fired back: 'Mr Palmer are you so convinced that Rupert Murdoch controls the views of all his journalists because you as a billionaire control the views of all your remaining senators?'

Mr Palmer did not back down and replied: 'I don't control anyone’s views. Individual citizens can think how they wish but certainly Rupert Murdoch it would seem does, as he's sacked so many people in this country.’

Palmer's tirade did not stop when another journalist stuck up for Scott 

The mining giant went on: '500 people have been sacked from News Corporation in Queensland over the last three years, if you go to the annual reports of News Limited and have a look at that. The Australian hasn't made a profit for over 50 years so you've got to ask what its economic rationale for being there.

‘The editor of the Sydney paper was sacked last election, we had News Limited editors coming from New York telling them what they could write and we had the cartoons of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and people being demeaned as individuals rather than attacking their policies.

‘As I said it makes no sense to attack individuals we need to attack the ideas to get the right policies for the country.'

Mr Palmer became irate after he was asked about his fraud case 

Morris responded: 'Why are you attacking journalists doing their job? This is a journalist club he was asking a question.'

Mr Palmer said he could not answer Scott’s question because it was about an active court case.

'I can't answer questions on that because the matter is before the court and it would be contempt of court. Now that's an answer and to persist with questions once you know that is really a disrespect for the court and fairness, and that's what it's about.

‘He raised serious allegations which are just allegations which have been raised before for six months by News Limited papers and lead nowhere.’
