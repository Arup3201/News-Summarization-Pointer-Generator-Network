Cambridge City striker Andrew Phillips has apologised for headbutting team-mate Josh Beech in his side's 2-0 Southern League Premier defeat by bottom club Banbury United. 

The striker was sent off for lashing out at Beech as the two exchanged heated words and squared up to each other after Phillips opted to shoot rather than pass.  

'Both players have apologised to squad members, manager and board of directors,' read a statement from the club, who play in the seventh-tier of English football .

Cambridge is usually associated with intellectual excellence but on Tuesday two Cambridge City team-mates were involved in an ugly spat on the pitch  

'Both Josh Beech and Andrew Phillips would also like to extend this apology to the supporters of the club without reservation.

'The club wishes to emphasise that they pride themselves on discipline both on and off the field. Further action regarding this incident will now be dealt with internally by both the club management and board of directors.'

It's not the first time two team-mates have come to blows - there was this  scrap between Newcastle's Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer in 2005

Gary Roberts,  the club's manager told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire after the game: 'It's disgraceful between the two of them. They will be fined.'

'The pair of them have apologised to each other and their team-mates. You have to have discipline on the pitch.'

The incident  is reminiscent of other cases of team-mates fighting, such as Newcastle's Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer in 2005, and Graeme Le Saux and David Batty while playing for Blackburn ten years earlier.
