Often overlooked in favour of it's bigger sister Stockholm, Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is making its mark on the culinary scene with four Michelin star restaurants and a soaring food culture.  

Keen to sample a different aspect of Swedish life, well-known presenter and DJ Alex Zane visited the city to try some of its infamous seafood dishes. 

'The city is still relatively untouched by tourists' he says, and the best restaurant he ate in was Sjömagasinet, which is 'the perfect place to enjoy fish in Gothenburg'.

Read our Q&A with him to find out what he made of the Scandinavian city.

Alex goes to Gothenburg: 'The place was packed full of hidden marine gems.... all delicious!'

What hidden gems does Gothenburg offer?

Described by many as the ‘Little London’, I knew I was in for something special when I boarded the plane to Sweden’s second city. With a buzzing design scene and a vibrant bar culture, it’s not surprising that Gothenburg is beginning to draw tourists in from across the world.

My visit to the city on the other hand, revealed some of the lesser-known reasons why people are making the journey here.

With the largest harbour in Scandinavia (and it’s pretty impressive in size) and the term ‘Scandi food’ starting to be used by more and more visitors, the city’s reputation for cuisine is starting to appeal to more than just food experts.

For me, the place was packed full of hidden marine gems from the sea, all cooked and prepared in the ‘Gothenburg way’ and all delicious!

Catch of the day: Gothenburg is known for its fresh fish and indoor Feskekôrka market

Is it somewhere for a weekend or is there enough to do on a longer break?

I could have eaten the food there for weeks, but there is more than enough to keep you entertained beyond the weekend if food alone doesn’t entice you. 

We went to the Liseberg amusement park on one of our days there, which first opened in 1923 and is fully powered by renewable energy. The wooden roller coaster has won all kinds of awards and I could see why that was the case as I stumbled out of the cart after my fifth go.

Best restaurant?

The best meal I ate while I was there this time was at the Sjömagasinet restaurant, which is ideally located by the waterfront and serves up Michelin starred dishes made from the freshest produce from the harbour that day. 

It’s in a stunning setting and, and the perfect place to enjoy fish in Gothenburg.

The city has the biggest harbour in Scandinavia so it's rife with shellfish and other marine delicacies

Best place to stay?

Hotel Pigalle. If you can’t stay, then make sure you just go in to see the eclectic decorations within – a feast for the eyes.

Alex's favourite thing about Gothenburg and why?

According to new research from American Express, Brits have sampled an average of seven different cuisines in the past year, so it seems dining around the world is becoming a bit of a trend. 

Scandinavia is gaining an unrivalled reputation for its seafood across the globe and Gothenburg has its biggest port, so it’s at the very heart of this. 

While the city is still relatively untouched by tourists, now is a great time to go over and sample the local delicacies.

Would he return?

I only scratched the surface of the great places to eat Scandi food over there, whether that be at Michelin starred restaurant or from amazing food markets like the indoor Feskekôrka market, so it’s not a question of if I would return, more when.
