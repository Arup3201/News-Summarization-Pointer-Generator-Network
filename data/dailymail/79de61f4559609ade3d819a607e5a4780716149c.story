Struck off: Kelly Baker lied that a young member of her family had cancer so that she could take time off work on full pay

A 'disturbed' teacher has been banned from teaching after lying that a young member of her family was dying of cancer so she could get extra holiday.

Kelly Baker, 31, claimed the child was terminally ill so she could take time off of work at her village primary school with full pay.

She was given paid leave during her 'elaborate story' about the young relative's cancer ordeal and kept it going for more than a year costing her school more than £100,000.

A disciplinary hearing was told she even phoned into the school saying she couldn't face teaching her classes - because the child had lost the use of his legs and fallen into a coma.

Baker produced fake medical certificates on her home computer in a bid to back up her story.

But her web of lies was exposed when her headmaster tried to visit the boy in hospital to deliver a get well soon card.

Education chiefs suspended her from her £30,000-a-year job at Cwmcarn Primary School at Cwmcarn , near Newport, South Wales, after becoming suspicious about her story.

After admitting two counts of fraud last year, Baker was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for two years

Yesterday, the General Teaching Council for Wales banned her from teaching after finding her guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.

She didn't attend the hearing in Cardiff but was given a prohibition order banning her from teaching for four years.

Baker cannot reapply for registration until 2017 and there is no guarantee she will be reinstated.

The panel concluded: 'We have heard evidence that Miss Baker's persistent and dishonest behaviour did adversely affect the emotional wellbeing of her pupils.

'She abused the trust of the school authority and her colleagues and her conduct did have serious financial implications for the school.'

At her trial at Cardiff Crown Court last July, the jury was told the school called in the police who arrested her for fraud.

She had caused a loss of £100,000 to the school including her wage and the cost of supply teachers to cover her absence.

Prosecutor Steve Harmes told the hearing: 'Staff and pupils at the school were distressed believing her relative had cancer.

'Baker initially took a month off citing family trauma and saying the child had been taken ill.

'Then, 18 months later, she said he had had lost the use of his legs before falling into a coma caused by a faulty ventilator starving him of oxygen.

'Two months later she said he had regained consciousness but was in a high dependency unit and unable to recognise members of his family.'

Mr Harmes added: 'Headteacher Gwyn Evans travelled to the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, to take a card to Baker and was told she was not there.

'In the days following his visit Baker said the child had to be transferred to Spire Hospital in Cardiff and needed six months of rehabilitation.

'But a phone call to the hospital by Mr Evans revealed the boy was not being treated there and they had taken no transfer from the Princess of Wales.

'Mr Evans then went to an address given on Baker's job application where a relative toldhim the child was perfectly well and had never been in hospital.'

The school later sacked her after discovering she also lied to them about needing time off work for her father's funeral.

Baker had also faked 13 health problems of her own to take time off from her job.

She claimed she was suffering from 'viral fatigue', a broken arm, fractured ribs, dislocated hip and a urinary tract infection

The school even discovered that Baker, a qualified teacher, had forged one of her references to get the job at the school.

Vaughan Britton, defending, said: 'She had created a fantasy world and then couldn't separate that from reality.'

But Judge William Gaskell told her: 'You are clearly a very disturbed lady.

'You alleged your relative was suffering from cancer and was in a coma and had lost the use of his legs - all wholly unture.

'It was a complete fabrication and anyone listening to the facts would regard your deceit as appalling.

'This is a strange and very unusual case and would cause anyone who hears about it to be wholly sickened.'

Baker admitted two counts of fraud and was given a six month suspended sentence suspended for two years.

Baker, of Maesycwmmer, near Caerphilly, South Wales, was put under an 18 month supervision order and had to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work.
