Banned: Townend, pictured here at the 2009 Badminton Horse Trials, was banned from driving after being stopped by police on May

One of Britain's top Olympic medal prospects may have had his dreams of glory dashed, after receiving a drink-driving ban three months before the competition.

Three day eventing star Oliver Townend, Britain's number one-ranked horseman prior to the London Games, was banned from driving for two years after being caught almost twice the legal alcohol driving limit.

Townend, who was stopped in his Mercedes SLK300 when police spotted him driving 'with excessive speed' and crossing double white lines, told magistrates his driving ban would 'seriously incriminate his chances of inclusion' in the British Olympic team'.

The Olympic hopeful, who won the prestigious Badminton and Burghley Horse Trial in 2009 and was ranked 16th in the world in 2010, was stopped by officers in Dudleston Heath, Shropshire on May 3.

Police spotted his car outside a Co-Op store and followed the horse rider when checks showed his MOT had expired.

Kate Price, prosecuting, told Shrewsbury magistrates when officers stopped Townend he 'stumbled out of his vehicle and smelt of alcohol.'

Townend, 28, was found to have 61 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35.

Townend, of Ellesmere, Shropshire, pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol on Thursday, May 3.

He told magistrates during the hearing where he was banned for two years from driving: 'This will seriously incriminate my chances of inclusion in the British Olympic team.

'Telling my parents has gone down fairly horrendously and it is an experience that will not be repeated. I will not put myself in this position again.'

Hopeful: Townend, currently ranked Britain's top event rider for 2012, had high hopes of making the Olympic squad and winning a medal this summer

Plea: Townend had told Shrewsbury Magistrates Court the two year driving ban would 'seriously incriminate' his chances of representing Britain at the London Olympics

Townend had represented himself at the hearing, where he apologised to the court for his behaviour and for taking up their time.

He was also ordered to pay a £110 fine, £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge and was offered the option of taking the drink drivers rehabilitation course with presiding magistrate, Patrica Edge wishing him luck as he left the court.

The British Equestrian Federation said: 'We do not in any way condone drinking and driving which is a serious offence that will be dealt with by the courts.

'Oliver has an outside chance for selection to the eventing team; however, this offence will not impact on the selection decision which is based primarily on results and also the other criteria laid down in the selection policy.'
