There will be the usual fanfare on Saturday when Wayne Rooney wins his 100th England cap.

But whilst it’s obviously a source of pride, it is nothing to shout about, and deep down he knows that.

I’m a big Rooney fan – regular readers of this column will be well aware of that. I have never questioned his passion to play for England, even when he has sometimes channelled that desire in a counter-productive way (abusing the fans in South Africa, getting sent off in Germany).

Of course you have to be a very good player to play a century of games for England.

But is it something to celebrate?

Rooney has been a regular for his country in an era when England have been desperate for strikers.

David Nugent, Kevin Davies, Carlton Cole and a fast-fading Emile Heskey have all won international caps in the Rooney era.

Had Rooney played in the mid-1990s he might not have reached 100 caps. He would have been competing with the likes of Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright, Robbie Fowler, Les Ferdinand and Andy Cole.

So a dearth of strikers over the past 10 years has helped Rooney’s total, without doubt.

But Rooney is on the verge of breaking the all-time scoring record for England, and his international quality cannot be questioned.

Until you get to tournament football.

Rooney will be well aware how atrocious his record is at World Cups – three of them, only one goal.

European Championships are better: two tournaments, five goals. But four of them were back in 2004.

On the face of it 100 caps is an achievement.

Breaking the scoring record for England will be something for Rooney to cherish, if and when it happens.

But I know how passionate this guy is when it comes to representing his country. And I suspect he would trade some of the caps and goals if it meant he could lead England to victory in France in 2016, or even Russia in 2018.

Some players have represented their country very well – in the modern era David Beckham, Ashley Cole and Rooney all spring to mind. They’ve all won a ton of caps.

Is it too harsh for me to declare my belief that, regardless of caps and goals, an England international’s career can be respected, but must be considered a failure without a major tournament victory?

Isn’t that what they’re all aiming for?

Wayne Rooney’s dream of such glory is still alive and I hope he goes for it. Be proud to represent your country 100 times but remember that isn’t the goal. Lifting a major trophy is what it’s all about.
