Paul Casey has resigned his membership of the European Tour and will be unable to play in any future Ryder Cups unless he rejoins. 

The gifted Englishman, who once rose as high as No 3 in the world, delivered the shock news after opening his season at the Sony Open in Hawaii on the PGA Tour with a terrific first round of 62 on Thursday.

The 37-year-old was a member of the European Tour for 13 years and served on the Tournament Players Committee for plenty of those. But the 13-time winner will concentrate on playing in America this season because he wants to cut down on travelling, after becoming a father for the first time last year.

‘For as long as I have been a professional I have been a member of the European Tour, so it was a very tough decision,’ he said. ‘But I live in Arizona and playing in America full-time will enable me to spend more time at home with Pollyanna (his wife) and Lex (his son). That’s really become the focus for me.’

Casey played in three successive Ryder Cups from 2004 and was unlucky not to get a wild card in 2010, when he was the world No 7. He could decide to rejoin the European Tour next year but, with the Ryder Cup qualifying process beginning in September, he would be giving everyone else a four-month head start.

Ironically enough, his decision comes against the background of leading American Patrick Reed going the other way and committing to membership of the European Tour, with Rickie Fowler likely to follow suit.

However, to be fair to Casey, their circumstances are different. The two Americans are comfortably ranked inside the world’s top 50, and so gain entry to all the majors and WGC events that count for membership on both tours. Casey is presently ranked 70th, and it’s much harder to play both tours with that ranking, where there are no guarantees. 

Casey acknowledged it was difficult to miss the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, where he has won twice in the past. ‘I stewed over that one for a long time and believe me it wasn’t a decision that I took lightly,’ he said.

While one course specialist is absent, another has set an imposing target for everyone else over the weekend. Martin Kaymer has already won this event three times and has become a hot favourite to win it again after following up his brilliant first round 64 with a 67 on Friday to reach a fabulous total of 13 under par. In winning the US Open last June he showed what a formidable frontrunner he is when he built on two opening rounds of 65 to walk away from the field over the weekend. It would be no surprise if he repeated the trick.

Kaymer built up a five-shot advantage over the other players in his half of the field and piled on the pressure on the likes of world No 1 Rory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler, who were both late starters on Friday and who began their second rounds at five under.

One high-profile player who couldn’t keep pace was Kaymer’s playing partner, Justin Rose. He finished on a total of two under after a second round 69 and faced an anxious wait to see if it was good enough to make the halfway cut.
