Footballer John Terry has been photographed shopping at Poundland – despite earning £170,000 a week.

The Chelsea captain was spotted by a fan in the store in Woking, Surrey, which is less than ten miles from the club’s training ground in Cobham.

The former England captain's basket was said to be heavily stocked.

'My mate asked him if it was okay to have a picture,' Chelsea supporter Jack Jeffery said.

'He was happy to let us. It was weird just walking in there and seeing him.

'He had a lot of stuff in his basket but I didn't really see what it was.

'When I told my friends they were shocked and wished they had met him as well.'

The fan added: 'He’s probably one of my favourite players.'

Despite his bargain hunting, earlier this year, photographs emerged on Mr Terry’s lavish new £10 million home, which is built in his old back garden.

The Chelsea defender was given permission to demolish the house he had built for his mother-in-law, beside the house he shared with wife Toni, and replace it with a nine-bedroom mansion.

His new home, pictured in March, is in Oxshott, Surrey, and also boats eight bathrooms, eight dressing rooms, an indoor pool, a Jacuzzi and a cinema room.

Meanwhile, in 2009, Mr Terry's mother, Sue, received a police caution for allegedly shoplifting £800 worth of clothes and groceries from Tesco and Marks & Spencer.
