'Troubled': Daniel Carter, 19, attacked a 16-year-old girl just one week after being released early from prison for abducting a 10-year-old girl

A thug carried out a terrifying attack on a 16-year-old girl in an alleyway just a week after being released early from prison for abducting a 10-year-old girl.

Daniel Carter, 19, grabbed the teenager and threatened to kill her unless she handed over her mobile phone.

The attack happened just 30 minutes after Carter, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, had met with his probation officer to discuss the terms of his early release from prison.

He was let out on licence on November 9 last year after serving just half of his 32-month sentence for abducting a 10-year-old girl in a park.

Carter was jailed for the sickening attack in July 2011 when he grabbed the girl in Central Forest Park in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and held her hostage while her parents searched for her frantically.

He covered the girl's mouth with his hand
and hid in bushes for 20 minutes before threatening to slit her throat 
if she made a noise.

But the brave girl managed to escape when
she screamed for help and her dad rushed over to find Carter trying to take pictures of her.

Carter, who admitted he was high on cocaine, cannabis and alcohol at the time, was jailed for child abduction.

The victim's parents had issued a statement pleading with the judge to order him to serve the whole sentence.

But on November 16 - just seven days after he was freed early from prison - he launched the terrifying attack on a second young girl.

Carter grabbed the 16-year-old and dragged her more than 10 feet down an alleyway before demanding her mobile phone.

Prosecutor David Bennett told the court: 'He said, 'Give me your phone or I will kill you'.

The victim was only saved when three men who were walking by saw the attack and wrestled
Carter off the girl before he fled.

Scene of the crime: Carter's first attack took place when he abducted a 10-year-old girl while she was in Central Forest Park, Stoke-on-Trent, with her parents

The frightened victim was found with a sore neck and Carter's blood on her arms and clothes.

Jason Holt, defending, described Carter as a troubled young man.

He added: 'He says he struggles when he is out of prison.

'He has now got to the stage where he finds solace with a custody environment.'

Jailing him for a further 32 months, Judge Granville Styler branded Carter a 'danger to the public'.

He told him: 'This is a serious matter. It was a terrifying incident for this young 16-year-old to be attacked at night by you.

'You have a previous serious matter involving a 10-year-old child who you abducted.

'You were on licence for that and were only released a few days previously, and this is how you react.

'You pose a danger to the public. This was a second attack on a female child.'
