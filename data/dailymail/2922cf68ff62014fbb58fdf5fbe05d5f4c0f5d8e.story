One of the country’s most unpopular rail companies has received another unwelcome accolade – more crimes take place on its trains than on any other line.

First Great Western (FGW) – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by  passengers for its frequent delays – saw an average of three offences on its trains every day last year, according to new figures.

Hundreds more crimes, ranging from theft of luggage to violence, took place at London’s Paddington Station from where many of the rail operator’s trains depart.

First Great Western has been dubbed 'Worst Late Western' by  passengers for its frequent delays

Overall some 11,000 crimes were recorded in 2013 on UK trains. The figures come as commuters brace themselves to pay hundreds of pounds more for season tickets as fare rises kick in this week.

In total British Transport Police recorded 53,885 offences in England, Scotland and Wales in 2012-13. This figure includes crimes at stations,  in station car parks, on tracks and on trains.

A third of all crimes on the railways involved theft of passengers’ property. Violence accounted for 15 per cent, theft and vandalism of cars and bikes for 14 per cent and theft of railway property nine per cent.

First Great Western's fares will rise by 3.1 per cent in the New Year

Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information ACT show that 1,179 offences were reported on FGW trains in 2013

New figures obtained by this newspaper 
under the Freedom of Information Act reveal for the first time which 
rail lines suffer the highest crime rates.

They show that 1,179 offences
 were reported on FGW trains in 2013.

The news will be greeted with 
dismay by the operator’s passengers, whose fares rise by 3.1 per cent in
 the New Year. The company, which serves the South West, Greater London, the South East, West Midlands and South Wales, is owned by FirstGroup PLC, whose chief executive Tim O’Toole  is paid a basic salary of £846,000.

Proportionally, the route with the most crimes reported is the  state-run East Coast line, operating the main route from London King¿s Cross to Newcastle and Edinburgh

About one in ten of its trains arrives late, according to latest figures, and over the summer 500 passengers had to endure a 12-hour journey in ‘cattle truck’ conditions after a brake problem on a service from Penzance to Paddington.

But FGW said its crime figures were not the worst, given the size of its network. Its trains call at 270 stations along 1,241 miles of track and carried 97 million passengers in 2012-13. The statistics mean there was a crime for every 82,527 passenger journeys on FGW trains last year.

A spokesman for the firm said: ‘These figures compare well to those of East Coast, Virgin and others when passenger numbers, and the size of network, are taken into account. Total crime across our network continues to fall year-on-year, as passenger numbers continue to rise.’

Proportionally, the route with the most crimes reported is the  state-run East Coast line, operating the main route from London King’s Cross to Newcastle and Edinburgh.It recorded 497 offences in 2013 but carried only 19 million passengers.

Despite the new figures, officials insisted that the rail network is becoming safer. Andy Trotter, Chief Constable of British Transport Police, said: ‘Despite the significant increase in passenger numbers in recent years, we have seen nine years of falling crime on Britain’s rail system.’

David Sidebottom, acting chief executive of independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘Passengers will be pleased to see this slight dip in crime figures. However, more than 10,000 crimes are still being recorded on trains each year so the hard work must continue.’
