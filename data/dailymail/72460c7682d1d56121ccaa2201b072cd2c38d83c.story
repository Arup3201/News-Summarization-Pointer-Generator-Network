He is cool under pressure when whipping up confections for his show Cake Boss.

But at 1am on Thursday morning reality star Buddy Valastro found himself in hot water when he was pulled over by Manhattan police for weaving his sports car through lower New York City, according to TMZ. 

After failing several field sobriety tests, the 37-year-old baker was handcuffed and arrested for investigation of drunken driving. It was also claimed that the star told police, 'You can't arrest me. I'm the cake boss!' and suggested the officers simply put him in a cab instead of taking him in.
