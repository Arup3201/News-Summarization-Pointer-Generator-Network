Suicide bid: Kiss Nightclub co-owner Elissandro 'Kiko' Spohr reportedly tried to take his own life in hospital

The owner of the Brazilian nightclub where 235 died in an horrific fire last weekend has tried to commit suicide in hospital, it has been reported.

Elissandro Spohr, 28, was under arrest following the tragic blaze at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, in the south of the country.

He was being held in hospital in the nearby city of Cruz Alta, where he reportedly tried to take his own life but was stopped by officers.

Inspector Marcelo Arigony from the 
Civil Police in Santa Maria said: 'He is OK and has now been handcuffed 
to the bed to avoid further attempts.'

Doctors said Spohr was suffering from severe depression which had left him 'emotionally compromised'.

Spohr has been the target of abuse 
and intense criticism from the friends and relatives of the victims, who are
demanding answers over the fire and calling for tighter controls to be introduced.

Spohr was one of four people arrested including two members of the band Gurizada Fandangueira, which had been performing when the fire started.

Spohr's business partner and Kiss co-owner Mauro Hoffman later handed himself in to police.

The fire is understood to have started during a pyrotechnic display accompanying the band's performance. The Kiss nightclub was not equipped with a fire alarm, sprinkler system or fire escapes.

When a band member tried to put out a fire that had been started by pyrotechnics, the extinguisher didn't work.

Rodrigo Martins, a guitarist for the 
group Gurizada Fandangueira, told Globo TV network in an interview 
Monday that the flames broke out minutes after the deployment of a 
pyrotechnic machine that fans out colored sparks, at around 2:30 a.m. 
local time.

'I felt that something was falling 
from the roof and I looked up and I saw the fire was spreading, and I 
shouted "Look, it's catching on fire, man, it's catching fire,"' Martins
said.

'Then the drummer tried to throw water on it, and it looked like the fire spread more then. Then the security guards came with an extinguisher, tried to use it, but it didn't work.

'I thought I was going to die there. 
There was nothing I could do, with the fire spreading and people 
screaming in front.'

Martins said that the club was packed and estimated the crowd at about 1,200-1,300 people. Other estimates had the figure at around 2,000.

Up to 2,000 people were believed to have been inside the club when the fire broke out

Revellers claimed bouncers had initially stopped them from fleeing the club concerned that people might not have paid their bar bills.

According to state Brazilian safety codes here, clubs should have one fire extinguisher every 1,500 square feet as well as multiple emergency exits.

Limits on the number of people admitted are to be strictly respected. None of that appears to have happened at the Santa Maria nightclub.

'A problem in Brazil is that there is no control of how many people are admitted in a building, said Joao Daniel Nunes, a civil engineer in nearby Porto Alegre.

'They never are clearly stated, and nobody controls how many people enter these night clubs.'

Santa Maria's mayor, Jose Fortunati, told Radio Gaucha that dozens of night spots were closed last year for failing to meet norms.

'At that time, we had lots of protest from those who frequented them, but I think that today people understand it better and that at times hard stands must be taken so that steps are taken to not put people's lives at risk," Fortunati said.

Brazilian police said they detained three people in connection with the blaze, while the newspaper O Globo said on its website that a fourth person had surrendered to police.

Police Inspector Ranolfo Vieira Junior said the detentions were part of the ongoing police probe and those detained can be held for up to five days.

Spohr can be held by police for five days and was arrested along with his business partner Mauro Hoffmann and two members of the band Gurizada Fandangueira, the band that was performing when the fire started.

No charges have yet been brought but conviction for voluntary manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison in Brazil.

Police officer Lylian Car√∫s told the Brazilian website G1: 'He says he no longer has the will to live. He doesn't think he can bear the weight of this tragedy on his shoulders.'
