Tina Martin gave birth to miracle baby Tassiah by caesarian section in January after 35 weeks of pregnancy despite having three organ transplants

A woman has given birth to a 'miracle' baby after undergoing three organ transplants.

Tina Martin, 43, gave birth to healthy 4lb baby Tassiah in January by caesarian section after 35 weeks of pregnancy.

Doctors had told her the little girl was unlikely to survive because of her frail condition and the drugs she was taking to make sure the organs would be accepted.

Mrs Martin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes aged seven and was given two kidney transplants, donated by her mother and brother, and a pancreas transplant, from a dead donor.

She was told that the birth was an 'absolute miracle' and health officials now believe that Mrs Martin is the oldest person to give birth following a kidney and pancreas transplant.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, Dr Jonathan Kwan, Mrs Martin's consultant at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, said: 'It is an absolute miracle that Tina managed to give birth to this little wonder, Tassiah, under the most adverse set of clinical circumstances. The odds were totally stacked against her.

'There cannot be many, if any, patients in the world who suffer from diabetic end stage kidney disease, who have a 10-year history of kidney failure treatment, who have been on dialysis and subsequently received three transplanted organs, and then managed to conceive successfully, never mind producing a healthy baby.'

Mrs Martin has two previous children who were also delivered by caesarian section, though before she had triple set of transplants.

The most recent operation was performed by Rachel Sturley and was complicated by the number of transplanted organs in Mrs Martin's abdomen.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that attacks the pancreas and stops the body producing insulin

When organs fail they are not removed unless they are causing medical problems.

Martin, who lives in Seaton, Devon, with her husband Neil, said: 'The obstetricians really did prepare me for the worst and were quite sure that the worst would happen.'

Since the birth Mrs Martin's pancreas, the third she has been given, has failed and she has been told she must wait until a year after the birth before the old one can be taken out and a new one put in.

As she is a small woman, surgeons cannot implant another organ without removing a failed one as there is not enough space left.

Mrs Martin has also gone blind due to her illness but remains optimistic about the future.

Type 1 diabetes is an auto immune disease which usually develops in teenagers, and only affects about 10 per cent of diabetes sufferers in the UK.

It occurs when the immune system attacks the cells of the pancreas, destroying the body's supply of insulin which is responsible for taking glucose into cells.

Without insulin blood sugar levels can become dangerously raised, damaging blood vessels, tissues and organs.

While regular blood sugar tests and injections of insulin can manage the disease, there is no cure.
