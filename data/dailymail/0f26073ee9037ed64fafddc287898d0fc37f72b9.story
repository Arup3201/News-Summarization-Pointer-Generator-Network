The third tier has housed a clutch of former Premier League sides in recent seasons including a couple of English football's heavyweights, with Leeds, Wolves, Southampton, Sheffields United and Wednesday, Leicester, Norwich and Charlton all dipping their toes in League One waters.

Only three of those - Norwich, Leicester and, last season, Wolves - were promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking, with Leeds spending three years in the third tier. 

This season, Sheffield United go one better, or worse, than Leeds as they embark on their fourth successive season in League One, and it is a stay they will be quadruply determined to end.

Rebuilding: Nigel Clough has overhauled the Sheffield United squad since taking over in late October

Returning to League One after just one season in the Championship are Doncaster and Yeovil, while Barnsley's eight-year stay in the second tier came to an end in May.

Coming up from League Two are three familiar faces to this level in Chesterfield, Scunthorpe and Rochdale, and one not so familiar one in Fleetwood, who start only their third season in the Football League. 

Intriguingly, no club in the division has changed their manager this summer - though that statistic is bound not to last very long once the new season kicks off.

The favourites

If Sheffield United replicate the form they showed in the second half of the last campaign they will surely be in the automatic promotion places.

Nigel Clough has reshaped the Blades squad to give it a younger feel and despite losing star man Harry Maguire to Hull this summer they have clearly improved on the whole.

Case for the defence: Maguire only turned 21 in March but made 166 appearances for the Blades

Similarly, Leyton Orient have lost a key player in winger Moses Odubajo to Brentford but look a better unit.

Orient just missed out on automatic promotion last season and look well set for another push for the top two after signing several players proven at Championship level.

The 85 points fifth-placed Preston had racked up last season would have been enough to win League One the campaign before.

While he has not made any eye-catching signings, manager Simon Grayson has managed to cling on to his key men and Preston are therefore again likely to challenge for automatic.

Bristol City flirted with a second successive relegation last season but had a revival once Steve Cotterill took charge in December.

They have also strengthened and if they can keep hold of their strikeforce of Jay Emmanuel-Thomas and 23-goal Sam Baldock they will be in the automatic promotion hunt.

Top of the charts: Baldock scored more goals than anyone else in League One last season

Doncaster are lacking strength in depth at the moment but their starting XI is as good as any at this level and with a few additions they will be ready to challenge for an immediate and automatic return to the Championship.

Dark horses

The relegated duo of Barnsley and Yeovil have rebuilt sufficiently over the summer to render them both promotion contenders but neither have the personnel nor the resources to have aspirations of dominating the division as Wolves did last season.

They will both, nonetheless, be targeting promotion, but may have to settle for the play-off route.

Peterborough flew out of the blocks last season before falling away badly and eventually being beaten in the play-off semi-finals by Orient.

Automatic promotion looks a bridge too far again for Darren Ferguson's side but if they can reinvest some of the £5m paid by Nottingham Forest for star striker Britt Assombalonga they should be assured another top-six finish.

MK Dons finished in the top six in 2011 and 2012 but have missed out in the last two seasons after selling many of their prizes assets.

But Karl Robinson has been able to improve his squad over the summer for the first time in years and they look in a position to challenge again.

Fleetwood's financial clout has seen them improve what was already a very strong squad after their League Two play-off final win over Burton and a third promotion in four years is not entirely out of the question.

Coventry, free from the 10-point deduction that hampered them last season, will have one eye on the top six despite losing top scorer Callum Wilson to Bournemouth.

Relegation battle

League One is the most treacherous division in the Football League by virtue of the fact that four go down rather than three in the Championship and two in League Two.

That being said, Notts County, who survived on the final day of last season, would have been relegated in League Two with their 50-point tally.

The Magpies won six of their last nine games under Shaun Derry last season and should survive more comfortably this time around with a mix of youth and experience added to the squad.

Conversely, fellow strugglers from last season Crewe look to have gone backwards over the summer and their fans will be fearing the drop unless they can unearth another gem or two from their academy - which history proves is not entirely out of the question.

Scunthorpe and Rochdale - promoted automatically from League Two in May - have both lost vital goals with Sam Winnall and Scott Hogan moving to Barnsley and Brentford respectively.

They could be joined in a relegation fight with League Two champions Chesterfield, who have been frustrated in the transfer market so far.

Elsewhere, Walsall and Crawley have been hit hard by summer departures and look set for a relegation battle along with perennial strugglers Colchester and Oldham.

Sheffield United 13/8, Preston 12/5, Bristol City 5/2, Peterborough 11/4, Leyton Orient 10/3, MK Dons 9/2, Barnsley 5/1, Doncaster 11/2, Yeovil 6/1, Coventry 7/1, Fleetwood 8/1, Bradford 9/1, Chesterfield 9/1, Scunthorpe 9/1, Swindon 10/1, Walsall 10/1, Oldham 12/1, Crawley 14/1, Gillingham 14/1, Notts County 14/1, Rochdale 14/1, Colchester 22/1, Port Vale 22/1, Crewe 28/1
