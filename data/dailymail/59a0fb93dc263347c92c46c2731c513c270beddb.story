Running away: One woman ran away so fast she fell over face first

He first marches into a park, surprising two women sitting on a bench having a refreshment.

One
 of the women is so terrified when the man approached them in two 
separate pieces, she sprints at full pelt to a sandpit and falls over 
face first.

The other woman bolts to her parked car screaming, and then speeds away.

In the creepy footage, the legless torso then walks down the pavement and frightens another couple of women out for a stroll.

Oh golly: Seeing a man cut in half at a traveling carnival may not shock you but what if you bumped into him walking down the street?

Gross doesn't give away the secret behind the illusion, leaving you guessing.

In fact, he ramped up the scare-factor by growling at the unsuspecting strangers as he walks around holding his sawed off legs.

One woman can be heard on the video of the prank saying 'That is so not cool.'

But the priceless reaction of most of the victims will have you doubling over laughing.
