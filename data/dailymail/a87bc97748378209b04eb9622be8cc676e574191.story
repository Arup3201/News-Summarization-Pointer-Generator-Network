At first glance, the outspoken Geordie singer and the future king don’t appear to have that much in common.

But Prince Charles is so taken with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Cole that he has employed her right-hand woman as one of his most senior advisors.

Former music industry executive Kristina Kyriacou, who is director of the singer’s new charity, the Cheryl Cole Foundation, has also just joined the royal household at Clarence House.

Working out of an office at the prince’s historic London home, glamorous Miss Kyriacou has even had a three-day-a-week post especially created for her - which comes with the impressive title ‘Assistant Communications Secretary, Charities and Marketing’.

As such, she has gone from promoting Take That to become the joint second most senior member of staff in Charles’s press office with responsibility for promoting his 17 charities and co-ordinating their work under ‘the prince’s vision’.

Her salary, which is undisclosed, is being paid for by the Duchy of Cornwall, which funds all the prince’s public work and private expenditure.

A former high flyer at record companies such as Sony - as well as promoting Take That she was also Gary Barlow’s manager during his rather unsuccessful solo career - she became Head of Media and Public Affairs at Comic Relief and it was through setting up a charity climb of Kilimanjaro with several celebrities that she first got to know Miss Cole, who also took part.

The outgoing brunette then directed Gordon Brown’s ‘No to Knives’ coalition before helping Miss Cole, who sang at last week’s Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace, to set up her own charity last year.

The singer’s Foundation hopes to provide funds to help young, unemployed and disadvantaged people in her home town of Newcastle fulfil their potential by setting up their own businesses or return to education.

The link-up will see the pop singer provide funds for Prince’s Trust work in the Newcastle area.

Her first fundraising effort is to sell off some of her old clothes – including a sexy rubber catsuit and several mightily revealing X Factor gowns - in conjunction with online retailer ASOS.

In February the 27-year-old singer went to Clarence House with Miss Kyriacou to discuss the merger, with the pop princess looking pleased as punch as she took tea with the future king and posed with him for publicity shots in the residence’s Garden Room.
