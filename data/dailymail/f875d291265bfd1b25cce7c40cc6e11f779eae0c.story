President Barack Obama on Wednesday cut short prison time for eight drug convicts and issued pardons to twelve other federal offenders in a move designed to draw attention to his objections to mandatory-minimum drug sentencing.

It's unclear whether the White House will issue a broader set of clemency proclamations in Obama last two years in office, but the news came while the nation's attention was focused on a handful of more controversial prisoner releases: the three Cuban spies traded to the Castro regime in exchange for an aging American aid worker who sat behind bars for five years.

That move came on the front end of a day-long White House focus on 'normalizing' diplomatic and trade relations between Washington and Havana. The 20 other recipients of presidential clemency went comparatively unnoticed. 

Obama's commutations were the first issued under new guidelines his administration announced earlier this year designed to cut costs by reducing the nation's bulging prison population.

A pardon forgives a crime without erasing the conviction, typically after the sentence has been served. A commutation leaves the conviction in place but ends the punishment earlier than a court has prescribed.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? (100 times the prison sentence!) Americans sentenced in the 1980s and 1990s for possession or distribution of crack cocaine (left) often received sentences far out of proportion with those caught using or selling the 'powder' form of the same drug (right)

There are 98,082 federal prisoners serving time in facilities like this one in Butner, North Carolina, for drug offenses, according to the Bureau of Prisons. That's 48.7 per cent of all convicts in the federal system

The White House said the eight shortened sentences were in cases where the prisoners would have received a substantially lower sentence if they were punished today, and would have already served their time.

Obama has said he wants to show leniency toward nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to double-digit federal prison terms. 

For example, Barbara Scrivner was sentenced to 30 years in 1995 when she was 27 years old for a minor role in her husband's methamphetamine ring.

Obama ordered her sentence to expire June 12; others will expire April 15.

Administration officials told the Associated Press that they expect Obama to grant more clemency petitions. 

The White House says 6,561 people already have applied in the past year, compared to 2,370 the year before.

'I think there is an awareness out there that this president is interested in granting clemency on these kinds of matters,' White House counsel Neil Eggleston told the AP.

The clemency policy changes aren't limited to drug offenders, who comprise about half of the roughly 216,000 federal prisoners, but the criteria make it clear they are the main target.

To be eligible, inmates must have already been behind bars for at least 10 years, have a nonviolent history, have no other major criminal convictions, have a good behavior record in prison, and be serving a sentence that, if imposed today, would be substantially shorter than what they were given at the time.

The old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of African-Americans in particular to long prison terms for crack cocaine convictions, while saddling those caught with powder cocaine with far more lenient sentences. Those convicts tended to be white.

The guidelines were enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly dangerous and violence-related drug.

Under that law, a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams of powder cocaine.

UNNOTICED: Obama's clemency proclamations were buried in the day's other prison-related news – the release of three Cuban spies in exchange for an ailing foreign aid worker imprisoned in Cuba since 2009

The president signed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010 to cut penalties for crack cocaine offenses in order to reduce the disparity. But the act addressed only new cases, not old ones.

In his first term, Obama commuted just one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people, leading prisoner advocates to accuse him of being too stingy with his power.

Obama aides said it was because he wasn't receiving more positive recommendations from the Office of the Pardon Attorney, so he directed the Justice Department to improve its clemency recommendation process and recruit more applications from among current prisoners.

The Bureau of Prisons has been notifying inmates of the new criteria, and the Justice Department has asked bar associations around the country to help prepare their petitions.

Deputy Attorney General James Cole, who in April announced the clemency policy changes, said in a statement that Wednesday's sentence commutations reflect a 'commitment to bring fairness to our criminal justice system.'

'While all eight were properly held accountable for their criminal actions, their punishments did not fit their crimes, and sentencing laws and policies have since been updated to ensure more fairness for low-level offenders,' he said. 

The White House noted Obama now has commuted 18 sentences, compared to 11 under President George W. Bush and three in the first six years of the Clinton presidency. Clinton eventually commuted 61, most of them in a controversial action on his last day in office.

President Barack Obama on has commuted the sentences of the following eight people convicted of drug crimes:

The president ordered the commuted sentences to expire on April 15, except for Johnson and Scrivner on June 12. 

Obama granted full pardons to twelve other convicts:

President picked low-level drug offenders whose sentences would have been shorter if they were punished today

New clemency guidelines originally brought few requests out of the woodwork so the DOJ ordered officials to encourage people to apply

News was little-reported because it came as the White House announced the release of three Cuban spies as part of a prisoner swap with Castro
