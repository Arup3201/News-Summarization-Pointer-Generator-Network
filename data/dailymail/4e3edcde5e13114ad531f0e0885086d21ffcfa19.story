He might not be fluffy or have big eyesÂ  - but he is arguably one of the cutest animals around.

Covered in scales with huge claws, a protruding nose and a long tongue, this pangolin shouldn't be so sweet - but the mammal can't help but melt hearts with his shy gaze and tiny body.

Clutching his hands together, this orphaned baby has won over his surrogate mother - and is sure to win an army of fans with his cute looks.

Ground pangolins are known as Manis temminckii in Latin but also go by the name scaly anteater and are one of the most endangered mammals in the world

Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are found in Africa and are one of the most endangered mammals in the world.

And this little creature is being cared for by his human 'adoptive mother', who initially cared for the mammal's birth mother, Roxy, when she was found on the black market.

Roxy gave birth to the little pangolin during her stay at the organisation and the unnamed baby is now being hand-reared by Maria Diekmann.

The 48-year-old feeds him a diet of milk, yoghurt and ants and often lets him sit on her head as in the wild the young often ride on their mother's back.

Maria, from Namibia,
who runs conservation group Rare and Endangered Species Trust (REST), 
said: 'Roxy was wild but was caught and taken around a local town in 
boxes, to be sold on the black market.

The curious creature joins a list of unusual photo-bombers including alpacas, great white sharks and sloths

'A shop owner felt sorry for her and bought her and we ended up taking her in.

'We hoped we could hold her for a few days until we could get a tracker on her before releasing her.

'But four days after receiving her she crawled slowly to me and sat in my lap and I soon realised that she had given birth.

'About three months later Roxy began begging to be let out.

'Because she had always returned previously, I let her out. She headed up a mountain and sadly that is the last time I saw her.

'After
many sleepless nights, the baby started responding well to plain 
yoghurt, special animal milk formula and his twice daily ant forages.'

And the creature might be tiny, but he's clearly got a big sense of humour - even clambering up on his surrogate mother's head to photobomb her pictures.

This baby pangolin, who is unnamed, has a 10 inch long tongue whihc could extend up to 27 inches when he is a fully grown adult

'His
favourite place was just behind her neck and that is why I believe he 
still loves to crawl onto the top of my head as I walk around. Thus, I 
always wear a hat,' Maria said.

'The photos that I took with my iPhone shows his tongue which is about a long as his body.'

The ground pangolin - Manis temminckii in Latin - are endangered and rare to find because they are difficult to spot.

They are covered in hard scales made from keratin, are nocturnal, and sleep curled up into a ball.

They have extremely long, sticky tongues that start in the abdomen and are used to delve into insect mounds to collect prey.

The baby pangolin Maria is caring for has will be named following a fundraising competition.

For the moment he is just known as 'baby'.
