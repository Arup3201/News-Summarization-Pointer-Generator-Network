The NFL is springing into action in the wake of two highly publicized incidents of abuse last week involving star players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, and has appointed three domestic violence experts to serve as senior advisers to the league.

In a memo to teams on Monday, commissioner Roger Goodell announced that Lisa Friel, Jane Randel and Rita Smith had been brought on to 'help lead and shape the NFL's policies and programs relating to domestic violence and sexual assault.'

The memo also informed teams that Anna Isaacson, currently the NFL's vice president of community affairs and philanthropy, will become its vice president of social responsibility.

New appointees: Jane Randel (left), co-founder of the No More campaign, and former head of the NYC Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit Lisa Friel (middle) are two of the women Goodell has hired to advise the NFL, while Anna Isaacson (right) has been made vice president of social responsibility

This comes after video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May.

Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, will return to team play this weekend.

These three new, and much needed, appointees bring years of experience to their positions.

Friel was the head of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in the New York County District Attorney's Office for more than a decade. 

Randel is the co-founder of No More, a campaign against domestic violence and sexual assault. 

Smith is the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 

And according to Goodell's memo, Isaacson's  role in the newly created social responsibility department will require her to 'oversee the development of the full range of education, training and support programs relating to domestic violence, sexual assault and matters of respect.'

Isaacson has been with the NFL since 2006. 

Problem players: Adrian Peterson (left, with son Adrian Peterson Jr.) has been indicted on charges of negligent injury for hitting one of his children with a switch, while Ray Rice (right, with wife Janay and Daughter Rayven) has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL after video of him punching his now-wife went public

Some have been calling for Goodells's resignation following what they believe to be the league's botched job of dealing with the Rice scandal.

Goodell claimed he had not seen the video of Rice punching his now-wife until last week, something an anonymous New Jersey law enforcement official possibly called into question when they revealed they had sent the tape to an NFL exec in April.

Furthermore, multiple sources close to Rice have claimed the Ravens running back revealed the full extent of the incident to Goodell in a meeting in June.

Rice initially only received a two-game suspension for his actions, and is expected to appeal his suspension ruling this week.
