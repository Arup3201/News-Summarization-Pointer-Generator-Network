A primary school has appointed 10-year-olds as ‘packed lunch police’ with the power to inspect the food younger pupils bring to school – and even issue warnings if it is unhealthy.

Parents have started a petition against the scheme after receiving a letter telling them to pack only healthy items.

Brooke Johnson, 34, whose children Charlee, seven, and Riley, five, are pupils, said: ‘It’s crackers. I decide what my children eat for lunch, not a 10 or 11-year-old.’ 

The letter from Hall Road Primary Academy in Hull states: ‘Year 6 will be packed lunch police and will be checking what children have in their lunches, with warning slips given if lunches do not meet our standards and awards for those that do.

‘Your packed lunch may include bread, pasta, crackers, rice, wraps, meat, cheese, fish, small yoghurt, fruit and vegetables. In order to be a healthy school, your packed lunch may not include crisps, chocolate spread, fizzy drink/energy drinks or food that needs heating up, eg micro chips.’

All pupils in the first three years of primary education have been provided with free school meals from this month – partly to stop parents giving children unhealthy food. But parents can still send their children with a packed lunch if they wish.

Miss Johnson, who started the petition, added: ‘My little girl came home from school starving because she hadn’t dared open her lunchbox.

‘She knew I had packed her sandwiches, crisps, a sausage roll, a small chocolate bar and apple juice.

‘I don’t see why she should risk being given one of these warning slips by another child just for eating her packed lunch. It’s ridiculous. 

'If these kids are inspecting my children’s sandwich fillings, how can I be sure they are washing their hands after going to the toilet and aren’t picking their noses? One six-year-old boy was given a warning slip just for having a Kellogg’s cereal bar.’

Headmistress Caroline Holliday said: ‘This healthy-eating campaign has been driven and implemented by our children themselves.’

At another school, parents have criticised ‘bullying’ staff for seizing snacks and drinks from lunchboxes.

Families began a petition after Caen Community Primary School in Braunton, Devon, started confiscating chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks.

Chairman of governors Joanna Howard said removed items would be returned at the end of school, and a free, healthy alternative was offered.

But Rob Lott, 38, whose three children attend the school, said: ‘It’s entirely pointless. Children are being bullied into eating specific foods.’

Schools should consider providing pupils with an evening snack alongside their breakfast and lunch, the Education Secretary said last night.

Nicky Morgan suggested that children who stay behind in after-school clubs so their parents can work should be given some ‘tea’.

Mrs Morgan made her comments at a fringe meeting at the Tory Party conference, when she was asked whether more schools should be using their buildings to provide childcare facilities.

She said schools already provide breakfast clubs and after-school clubs. She said she would consider a proposal from a Conservative councillor that poorer children receive free breakfasts, funded through the pupil premium.

A source at the Department for Education said that if children are staying at school late it would be ‘unfair’ not to feed them.
