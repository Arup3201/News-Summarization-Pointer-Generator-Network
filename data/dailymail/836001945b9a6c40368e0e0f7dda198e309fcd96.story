A four-year-old girl has died from suspected meningitis after being sent home by a hospital children’s ward.

Now an investigation is under way to discover why Morgan Phelan was discharged when she had a high temperature and was suffering from a rash all over her body.

Gemma Phelan’s daughter, Morgan, was seen in A&E at Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital in the West Midlands shortly after 7pm on Thursday, January 17 and admitted at 11.30pm.

But she was discharged just over an hour later at 12.47am the following day, diagnosed with a viral infection.

Four-year-old Morgan Phelan died from suspected meningitis after being sent home from Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital. An investigation is now underway

The four-year-old, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, remained poorly on Friday but went downhill again on Saturday afternoon before being rushed by ambulance to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where she was declared dead around 5pm.

Now Good Hope Hospital is conducting an inquiry into her treatment.

Her distraught mother said Morgan had been suffering from a high temperature and had a rash all over her body, but she had been reassured that all she had was a minor infection.

Mrs Phelan reacted with anger when she discovered that the children’s ward, Harvey Ward, at Good Hope had since been closed due to a 'lack of appropriately qualified staff'.

She fears that had it been closed earlier Morgan may still be alive today.

'I believe she was discharged because they didn’t have enough staff to look after her,' Mrs Phelan said.

'The last time I saw my little girl as normal was on Thursday morning when I took her to school.

'When she came home from school I knew she wasn’t very well and at 6.30pm I rang the ambulance.

'At 7.20pm she was seen by the nurses and she was admitted to the ward at 11.38pm but just over an hour later she was examined and discharged as we were told she was “fine to go home”.

'It was snowy and she had nothing on her feet.

'I was told she had an infection and there was nothing more wrong with her breathing but she was covered in a red rash.

'On Friday she was not eating or drinking but we were told unless her temperature came back there was nothing to worry about. To me it didn’t look right.'

Although she briefly appeared to rally on Saturday she then went downhill rapidly. She died later that afternoon.

'I kept checking her temperature and encouraging her to come downstairs,' said Mrs Phelan, who has another child, two-year-old Kian, with husband Ryan.

'On Saturday she seemed a bit better and she had a couple of sips of pop. I bought her sweets from the shop and went to make her stew but when I went back and saw her, her eyes were like glass.

'I called an ambulance and when they came they put her on the floor. I was told to sort out an overnight bag. On the heartbeat machine she was flatlining at first but then it picked up her heartbeat.

'They took her to the Children’s Hospital but she was declared dead at 5.10pm.

'When I read the Harvey Ward has been closed that sent me so angry and I started shaking. The hospital said it would only affect one or two children but how many has it affected?

'Had the Harvey Ward shut before or had they not discharged her at 1am she might still be here. I believe had they given her penicillin she would be alive today.

'I have been told there will be an inquest in six months and we may find out more in three months.'

Mrs Phelan also received a letter from the hospital which referred to Morgan as a boy and “he”, which upset her further.

Sue Moore, managing director for Good Hope Hospital, said: 'This is a tragic case and we would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family of Morgan Phelan during this very difficult time.'

We take the care and safety of all of our patients very seriously and we are currently undertaking an investigation into Morgan’s sad death which will be shared with the family.

'Unfortunately, due to patient confidentiality, we cannot comment on any individual patient’s treatment.

'We have arranged to meet with the family so we can discuss and address their concerns fully.

'Our decision to close Harvey ward has been taken following the advice of clinicians and is in response to ensuring safe staffing levels within specialist paediatric nursing.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
