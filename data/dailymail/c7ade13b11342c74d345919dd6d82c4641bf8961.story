Lucas Tuppeny was born with a bowel defect and needed a colostomy but a series of mistakes by doctors left him in renal failure, needing a transplant

A 10-year-old who had to have a kidney transplant after mistakes by doctors at a private hospital left him in renal failure, has today been awarded £4.8 million in compensation.

Lucas Tuppeny was born in January 2004 with a bowel defect, and required a colostomy, Judge Richard Parkes heard at London's High Court. 

A series of errors by medical staff at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington, London, resulted in Lucas suffering renal failure. 

It left the youngster needing dialysis from the age of six months. 

In October 2005 he received a kidney from his father, Brock, who works in the oil industry.  

Lucas, who lived in Ruislip, Middlesex, at the time but is now settled with his mother, Therese, in Seattle, in the U.S., has had 28 procedures with a total of 149 days in hospital.

And he will need another transplant in the future, the court heard.

In spite of his problems, Lucas is an 'enthusiastic, optimistic, energetic and very sociable little boy', Christopher Johnston QC said.

Asked how he was feeling by the judge, Lucas stood and said 'Good, your Lordship', adding he would be having a holiday in the Bahamas before going back to school.

The judge, who approved the settlement against the hospital, which admitted liability, said: 'I am delighted to hear it.

'It is lovely to see you and I would just like to wish you all the best for the future.

'You are very lucky in your mum and your dad.'

Both the judge and the hospital's counsel, Jeremy Hyam, paid tribute to the outstanding care shown by Lucas's mother.

The judge, who had seen a video about Lucas, told Mrs Tuppeny: 'What extraordinary devotion you have lavished on your son throughout these difficult years.

'I don't think anyone on the outside would know what is involved.

'One can only watch with huge respect what you and indeed your former husband have done.

'Having seen the video makes one realise what a splendid young man Lucas is and what potential he has, thanks to you.'

London's High Court heard the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington admitted liability. Judge Richard Parkes awarded Lucas's family £4.8 million in compensation to pay for his medical costs and future loss of earnings

Alison Eddy, a partner with lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said outside court: 'It is a huge relief for his family that the hospital and medical staff who cared for him have now agreed an adequate and fair settlement to cover his care needs both now and in the future.

'This young boy has suffered a catalogue of medical issues throughout his childhood and will face numerous problems in his future as his condition deteriorates.

'We are pleased that we secured this settlement for him and his family, who now have the financial security and reassurance that costs for his future treatment will be met.

'We hope that lessons are learnt by the hospital and their staff so that patient safety in this situation can be improved and each and every patient receives the best quality of care at all times.'

The damages will cover Lucas's medical and care costs and anticipated future loss of earnings. 

A spokesman for the Bupa Cromwell Hospital told MailOnline: 'We did not own the hospital in 2004. 

'However, we are very sorry that Lucas suffered these problems and would again like to apologise to him and his family.

'We hope that this settlement will give Lucas and his parents the security of knowing that his future care and support needs can be met.

'We wish Lucas and his family well for the future.'
