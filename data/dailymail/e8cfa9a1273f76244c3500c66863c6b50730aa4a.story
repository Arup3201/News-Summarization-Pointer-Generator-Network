A Georgia police officer stopped at a fire station to get help delivering his wife's baby when the couple realized they weren't going to reach hospital in time.

Jeremy Massengill, of Dunwoody, said that his wife, Jennifer, would 'yell at little louder' at each red light - and that's when he decided they needed to stop, as the drama unfolded on Sunday.

He then pulled into the Cobb County firehouse to seek assistance from paramedics.
