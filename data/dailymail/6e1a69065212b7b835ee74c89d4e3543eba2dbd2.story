A man who made millions running a phony breast cancer charity called Boobies Rock! in order to fund his lavish lifestyle may have hit rock bottom.

Adam Shyrock, 35, accused of running two fraudulent national breast cancer charities was ordered by a judge to return $1.89 million in gross receipts and pay $4 million in civil penalties.

The Colorado Attorney General's Office says District Judge Shelley Gilman handed down her ruling against Boobies Rock! founder Adam Shryock  on Thursday and issued an injunction barring him from ever working on or near a charitable solicitation again.

Shyrock is also accused of operating a second fraudulent charity called Say No 2 cancer.

The Attorney General's office filed a complaint against Shryock and his businesses in 2013, saying they were committing charitable fraud. 

He was accused of misleading customers around the country into thinking more of their money was going to breast cancer charities.

Shryock is currently serving another sentence on contempt of court charges.

Shryock only sent a little bit of money to legitimate cancer groups while using company bank accounts to buy himself a BMW, subscribe to an online dating service, and to pay bar tabs and a maid service, Attorney General John Suthers said in a complaint filed in Denver District Court.

On his Facebook page, Shryock could be seen posing in front of his luxury car and carousing with friends. Other images show him lounging in his palatial home, which he shared with a pure-bred huskie.

Boobies Rock! Inc. and Say No 2 Cancer disabled their websites back in 2013 since a Denver judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting operations and freezed accounts.

According to the Colorado complaint, Shryock originally ran Boobies Rock! from San Francisco after incorporating it in California in 2011, but he moved to Castle Rock, Colo., south of Denver in 2012.

The address once listed for Shryock was for a 4-bedroom, 6-bath mansion valued at just under $2m boasting a granite fireplace, Italian tile and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Rocky Mountains.

Shryock, a University of Kansas graduate, got engaged in 2013, presenting his bride-to-be with a massive diamond ring.

It's unknown if the pair are still together. 

Shryock launched Say No 2 Cancer in January of 2012, the complaint said.

Suthers wrote that the companies would send models to bars or sporting events to sell merchandise, with instructions to mention that Boobies Rock! is a for-profit company only when asked. Oftentimes, people simply made cash donations. 

The models would tell bar owners and patrons that anywhere from 40 to 90 per cent of the proceeds from their purchases would go directly towards the fight against cancer.

A Twitter account for the fraudulent charity still lingers.  'Hiring For Sales Reps! $4,500-$6,000 per month, message us for details!,' says one of their recent posts.

Boobies Rock! did give $50,000 to the Pink Fund, based in the Detroit area — but only to avoid lawsuits after Pink Fund found out the company was using its name without its permission, Suthers’ complaint said.

Suthers said Boobies Rock! donated $25,000 to another organization, also to avoid a lawsuit. Other donations fell short of the percentage of net revenue that Boobies Rock! represented it would donate, the complaint said.

Shyrock is no longer allowed to do any charity work by law.

‘Shryock passed through the absolute bare minimum to a series of legitimate nonprofit charities to keep his scheme alive,’ Suthers said, ac. ‘Moreover, the IRS has no record of awarding tax-exempt status to a company he launched in January 2013, Say No2 Cancer,’ Coloradoan.com reported.

On the site Yelp back in 2913, a trio of three reviewers awarded Boobies Rock! only one star out of five, with online user Domingo K. from Illinois slamming the organization as 'sleazy and dishonest.'

In a review posted by Kelly H., from Arizona a few years ago, the woman wrote that she had worked for the charity as a promotional manager for two months, during which time it was her job to have the models tell costumers that all the proceeds from merchandise sales go toward breast cancer awareness.

'This is total lie!' Kelly stated. ‘This is a for profit company that gives very little to none of their money to breast cancer. I am doing everything I can to make sure that this scam is made known nation wide [sic]. Do not buy anything from this company!’
