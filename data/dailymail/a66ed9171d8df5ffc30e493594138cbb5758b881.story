Discovered: The body of Kosta Karageorge was found on Sunday in a dumpster two blocks from his Columbus, Ohio, apartment

A neuropathologist will look for signs of traumatic brain injury in an Ohio State football player who was found dead in a dumpster with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and had a  history of concussions.

Kosta Karageorge, was discovered in the trash bin days after sending his mother cryptic texts apologizing for being 'an embarrassment' because of his repeated head injuries. 

The examination, not normally part of the autopsy process, is being done on Kosta Karageorge because of that history, the Franklin County coroner Dr. Anahi Ortiz said on Monday. 

Police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said police received a call around 2:30 p.m. on Sunday from someone reporting a body found in the trash bin in Columbus.

Weiner said a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body, which had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

'At this time we are able to confirm through tattoos here at the scene that it is the body of Kosta Karageorge,' Weiner said.

Weiner also revealed that a handgun was recovered from the dumpster.

Police found the body near the campus after a search began when Karageorge went missing Wednesday. The senior defensive tackle had last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk.

Susan Karageorge told police she had received a text from her son about 1:30am on Wednesday that said, 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.' 

The body was found within a couple hundred yards of Karageorge's home and about a half block from High Street, the main artery of the campus. Sunday evening, no one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the metal door of Karageorge's apartment.

Players knew of Karageorge's history of concussions, teammate Michael Bennett, a defensive tackle, said Monday.

'We knew he had a lot of concussions and we were worried about that. But we didn't see any side effects of it,' Bennett said.

Dr. Tom McAllister, chairman of psychiatry at Indiana University, who has studied concussions in college athletes, said that brain injuries seem to increase the likelihood of depression.

If the person had depression or an anxiety disorder in the past, 'it often is the case that the concussion seems to exacerbate it,' he said. 'These injuries don't occur in a vacuum. People bring their own past history ... into the injury.'

The team's physician said he's confident in the policies in which athletes are returned to play after injury

Karageorge's parents filed a missing-person report Wednesday evening, and his mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused, according to the report. 

She said that at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message apologizing and saying the concussions had messed up his head. 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment,' he said.

A woman answering the phone Sunday at Susan Karageorge's home identified herself as a friend and said that neither Susan Karageorge nor other family members had any comment.

University athletic officials said they were grieved to learn of Karageorge's death.

'It's hit the team hard,' team spokesman Jerry Emig said.

Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said in a text message when asked about any plans to honor the player or logistics for the team to attend the funeral that it was too soon to answer those questions. The Buckeyes will play Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

A former Ohio State wrestler, Karageorge joined the football team as a walk-on this season. He played in one game and was among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at the final home game Saturday against rival Michigan. The Buckeyes won, 42-28.

Ohio State University's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out his name and the missing poster appeared on the scoreboard.  

The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices.

His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused.

The team's physician insists the squad would not have let Karageorge play after injury or illness if he weren't ready. 

Karageorge was last seen at his apartment around 2 am Wednesday, his sister, Sophia Karageorge told The Columbus Dispatch.
