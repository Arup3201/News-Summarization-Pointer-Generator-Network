A New Hampshire jury has rejected a claim that a woman developed post-traumatic stress disorder that made her fear the frozen food aisle in stores because she found a rat in her frozen lemonade.

Colleen Grady, 50, testified in a Manchester civil trial that her friend opened a can of Minute Maid frozen lemonade on a July night two years ago to prepare for a dinner party and found a frozen rat inside.

Ms. Grady claimed her 
friends were pouring the can of lemonade into a pitcher when a dead rat 
and maggots fell out causing her emotional distress.

She told the court that she was forced to keep the dead rat in her freezer for more than a week until a Coca-Cola Company courier arrived to pick it up.

The frozen rat, Grady’s attorney said, was on display throughout the three-day civil trial.

Grady
 also sued Hannaford Supermarkets and Victory Distributors, saying that 
she was so traumatized at seeing fur, tail and teeth in her drink that 
she was afraid of the frozen food section at supermarkets and thought 
sudden movements behind her could be a rat.

But
 a New Hampshire Superior Court jury ruled in favor of the defendants in
 the suit and denied Grady a civil settlement, a ruling applauded by 
Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola 
countered the argument with a video tour of the factory where the 
lemonade was packaged, experts on the life cycle of the maggot, and even
 doctors offering alternate explanations for her anxiety attacks.

'This
 verdict affirms that Minute Maid beverages meet the highest quality 
standards at all times,' said Jennifer Cruikshank, a spokesperson for 
Coca Cola.

'Our 
production process and stringent quality protocols make it virtually 
impossible for this situation to occur. It’s unfortunate that someone 
would seek to profit from such baseless allegations.  We are pleased the
 ruling was in our favor.'
