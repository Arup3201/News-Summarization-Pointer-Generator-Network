A team of labourers unearthed a pile of human bones yesterday as they dug up the edge of a dual carriageway, it has been revealed.

The road workers made the grim discovery as they performed repairs to the side of the southbound carriageway of the A23, 100m south of the Slaugham junction in West Sussex, police said.

Despite having been chewed and scattered by wild animals, the bones instantly resembled the remains of a human skeleton.

It is unclear exactly how the bones ended up on the side of the busy road, but police say one possibility is that animals dug them up and carried them there.

Specialist search and scenes of crime officers have been examining the bones with a forensic archaeologist as well as searching the surrounding area. Nothing else has been found at this time, a police spokesman said.

He said: 'There are several small pieces of bone and we believe they are human.

'They will be removed today and taken to a forensic laboratory for detailed examination, which may take some time.

Business as usual: The A23 has not been closed and roadworks continue in all but the area immediately taped off by police

'We are keeping an open mind at this time and have not yet formed a view on how the bones came to be there or their age.

'Although very close to the carriageway it is possible that they may have been carried there by animals.

'There is no evidence to show that they had been buried as they appeared on the surface during the process of digging and ground clearance.'

The A23 has not been closed and roadworks continue in all but the area immediately taped off by police.

The spokesman said drivers travelling southbound on the A23 are advised that the search may extend a short distance across the crash barrier to the side of the road.

Drivers are asked to take extra care when coming down Handcross Hill which is already subject to a 50mph restriction, he added.
