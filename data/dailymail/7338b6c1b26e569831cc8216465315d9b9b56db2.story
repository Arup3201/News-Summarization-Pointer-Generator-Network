Whoopi Goldberg is rising to Bill Cosby's defense as claims he raped more than a dozen women begin to mount. 

The View star expressed skepticism today about allegations by Barbara Bowman that the 77-year-old comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1985.

Ms Bowman said that she went to a lawyer, who laughed at her when she tried to say that Cosby had sexually assaulted her multiple times when she was an aspiring actress and model.

Goldberg asked why Ms Bowman didn't go to the authorities for proof that she was raped.

Whoopi Goldberg expressed skepticism of rape claims against Bill Cosby and wondered why accuser Barbara Bowman never went to the police

'Perhaps the police might have believed it. Or the hospital. Don't you do a kit when you say someone has raped you?' she asked. 

'But there was a settlement,' co-host Rosie O'Donnell said, referring to a suit brought by another woman, Andrea Costand, in 2006. 'So that's the thing that's curious.'

Ms Bowman said she didn't tell anyone, including the police, about the alleged sexual assault for years because she believed that Cosby was too famous and too powerful for anyone to take her seriously. 

She said she couldn't even tell her mother about what allegedly happened. 

Last month, she told MailOnline in excruciating detail how Cosby allegedly drugged her after he went to his New York home and had a single glass of wine as an impressionable 17-year-old in 1985. She passed out and came to wearing only a man's t-shirt and her underwear, certain that she had been sexually assaulted. 

She claimed he also pinned her down and tried to rape her in his hotel suite in Atlantic City in 1987. 

She also said she has never asked for, nor taken money from Cosby. CelebrityNetWorth.com pegs the former 'Cosby Show' actor's wealth at $400million. 

Cosby, 77, has stayed literally silent about the allegations - refusing to even speak when asked about them on NPR over the weekend

Barbara Bowman told MailOnline in excruciating detail how she was allegedly drugged and assaulted by Bill Cosby as a teenage model nearly 30 years ago

Goldberg said she doesn't buy the story: 'Quite honestly, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something - it doesn't matter now. The cat is out of the bag, people have it in their head. I have a lot of questions for the lady, maybe she'll come on.'

In November 2006, Bill Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. 

Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify.

Last month, Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. She was one of the 13 women willing to support Constand in 2006.

Joan Tarshis has become the latest woman to accuse him of raping her. On Sunday, she revealed she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when he drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions, she said.

She appeared to sympathize with Cosby, saying it was 'awkward' when celebrities were falsely accused of crimes.  

'I hope that there is justice for this lady. I hope somebody gets to the bottom of this, but I’m going to reserve my judgment because I have a lot of questions, as I said. It’s crazy, but I have a lot of questions, because I know we all have friends who have gone through this.'

Co-host Nicolle Wallace responded to Goldberg: 'It’s more than awkward, it’s a tragedy!' 

'Either 13 women were raped by someone too powerful to face the criminal justice system or an innocent man is being falsely accused.'

Thirteen women signed on to a 2005 lawsuit brought by Andrea Constand alleging sexual assault. Ms Bowman said she testified as part of that lawsuit but never received a payout after Cosby settled out of court.

Cosby's lawyer has denied the new round of claims and has said that the 77-year-old wouldn't 'dignify' the claims with a response. When asked by NPR over the weekend, Cosby smiled and refused to respond.

Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him. 

Goldberg said she is not convinced by the claims against Cosby. And the fact that he settled a 2005 lawsuit brought by another sex assault accuser, should not be seen as an admission of guilt. 

'You have to really take a minute and follow the evidence - follow what happened,' she said. 'We'll know when we know. That's what I know.'
