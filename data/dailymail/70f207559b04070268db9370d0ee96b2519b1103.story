Ding dong row: Edward Elgar is being dragged to court by his French neighbour over noisy cowbells

A British publisher is being taken to court by his French neighbour in a row over cow bells.

Edward Elgar, 63, allows a local farmer to graze his cows on his estate in the south of France, something which a new ‘townie’ neighbour alleges breaches his human rights because the cattle’s bells keep him up at night.

Mr Elgar now faces a potential £4,000 fine if a French court rules in favour of neighbour Yves Meignan.

Mr Elgar, who owns Edward Elgar Publishing in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, bought the 10-bedroom mansion in the Languedoc-Roussillon region in 2006.

He generously allows beef farmer Claude Mesjeans to keep his 150-strong herd on his 20-hectares of land where the cows all wear the traditional bells.

When Mr Meignan moved into a house bordering the land in 2010, he began complaining that the noise from the bells was keeping him up at night and has now taken his case to the local authorities.

‘I'm not going to have myself being pushed around by anyone, let alone an arrogant Frenchman,’ Mr Elgar said.

‘He's complained about the noise of the bells, which keep him awake at night, and which he claims are in breach of his human rights for a good night's sleep.

‘He's filed claims that it's causing him psychological damage.’

News of the row has caused uproar in rural France, and more than 4,000 people have backed a national petition supporting Mr Elgar and farmer Claude.

Father-of-three Edward said: ‘I think this guy must be getting very scared. The countryside is in uproar about this city man's complaint - cow bells are a vital way of life.

‘I certainly would not want rural Frenchmen angry at me.

‘People feel passionate about the countryside and those trying to make a living in difficult circumstances, and when someone is trying to overturn traditions that have been running for hundreds of years.

‘And it's a part of France where it's important the cows have bells because they can escape from the fields, and it is rough terrain.’

Peaceful sound: Edward Elgar, in a cap walking on his estate with farmer Claude Mesjeans, said the first time he heard of any complaint was when he received a letter from a lawyer

He added that Mr Meignan has not been in touch about his problem but went straight to the courts: ‘I think he was ill-advised by his lawyers to take out the lawsuit.

‘The first I heard of his grievance was a letter from his laywer. His very aggressive stance was very silly.’

Many of the comments on the petition website are critical of Meignan's attitude.

One visitor wrote: ‘We must defend our rural traditions and in the face of what I call disrespectful urbanites migrating to the countryside.

‘When you move to a village, you know what to expect and that's why you settle there.

‘It's too easy to take everyone to court to ensure their little individualistic conception of rural life and serenity is maintained! Long live the countryside!’

Long live the bell! A petition in support for Claude Mesjeans, right, and Mr Elgar has been backed by 4,000 people calling for Mr Meignan to drop the complain

Traditional: Cow bells are worn by freely-roaming livestock so they can be heard whenever they wander off or run away

Another angry petitioner wrote: ‘Why doesn't he just wear earplugs and shut up?’

Edward, who splits his time between homes in France and Cheltenham, first heard from disgruntled Meignan's lawyer in April this year.

Last month Edward received a formal summons to appear before the district court - the Tribunal de Grande Instance d'Alhs.

Edward spends the summer months at his property in France, which he describes as being peaceful and quiet.

He said: ‘It's such a relaxing place to be. I can't understand why anyone would take umbrage with the noise of the countryside.

‘It's much better than car alarms and sirens.’
