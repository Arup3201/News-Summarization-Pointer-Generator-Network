He's one of the most famous faces in sport and knows how to turn on the charm during interviews.

But, as this training video from 1993 shows, a young David Beckham needed coaching off the field to get used to talking to the media.

A 17-year-old Beckham is seen during a role-play interview as part of the rigorous preparation for life as a professional footballer.

And in a frank written assessment of his own performance, the future star wrote: 'I played crap... the officials were crap as well.'

Scroll down to watch the video...

A 17-year-old David Beckham is seen practising talking to the media in a video set to sell for £3,000 at auction

In the footage, Beckham is seen answering questions about his performance as part of his youth team training at Manchester United

The future England captain was part of the famous Manchester United youth team that won the 1992 FA Youth Cup.

His team-mates Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville are also seen practising their post-match interviews in the video, which is expected to fetch £3,000 at auction next week.

Beckham, from Leystonstone, east London, appears to be slightly awkward in front of the camera as he answers questions about his performance during the mock interview.

He squirms and looks embarrassed but gives a shy smile when the interviewer asks him to talk through his goal-scoring moment, with Beckham answering: 'Soon as I hit the ball I knew it was going in the top corner.'

Later, when asked to imagine that the team had lost the Youth Cup final, Beckham puts on a suitably sad face as he talks about the effect defeat would have on 'the lads'.

He says: ''I didn’t do too well, really. Just nothin' was going right, really. Nothin' went our way really. We didn’t have no luck.'

At another point, he tells interviewer Andy Buckley how 
he hoped to play for United's first team in the next couple of years and
go on to emulate his hero Bryan Robson.

Dressed casually in a blue polo shirt, the only hint of Beckham's future as a fashion icon is his slicked-back hair, which would later earn him a contract with Brylcreem. 

The young players also had to analyse their performances on paper, with Beckham criticising himself for playing 'really crap'

The video also shows that Beckham, now a
polished and media-savvy performer, has lost some of his
east London accent over the years, with the auctioneer selling the video
speculating that he may have had elocution lessons to help his public 
speaking.

As well as the practice TV interviews, Sir Alex Ferguson's young players also had to analyse their best and worst performances on handwritten forms.

Beckham wrote: 'My 
best game was the youth cup final in 1991 against Crystal Palace 1st leg
when we won 3-1 and everythink (sic) went right and I scored a good 
goal + set up 1 and the crowd was really good and load (sic).'

For his worst game, he wrote: 'Youth cup final 2nd leg good atmosphere but I played really crap, nothink (sic) went right for me or the team, and the officials were crap as well.'

The March 1993 media training course was also taken by Giggs, Neville and Scholes, with Ferguson wanting them well-prepared for dealing with fame and attention from an early age.

Ryan Giggs gave short, to-the-point answers before walking away from the camera quickly once his interview was over 

Giggs showed that he was highly self-critical by being unable to name a game where he'd played well

All four footballers seem to find it difficult to relax with the camera on them and regularly looked at the floor instead of their interviewer.

Giggs, wearing a backwards baseball cap, speaks softly, gives short answers and walks off quickly afterwards to get out of the spotlight despite being told 'very good'.

In his notes, Giggs couldn't think of a 
match he'd played well in and left a blank space.

He did, however, say that his performance against Oldham wasn't
good enough, writing: 'I got marked out of the game and I must of 
kicked the ball about twice.'

Neville, now a Mail on Sunday sports columnist and Sky Sports pundit, analysed the 1993 Youth Cup Final second leg against Leeds in his typically blunt fashion.

Gary Neville, another member of the youth team who stayed with the club for years, also took part in the session

Gary Neville's notes celebrated the team victory at Crystal Palace but bemoaned that he 'didn't feel in the game' against Leeds

'A******* dropped out. Didn't feel in the game.'

Scholes wrote: 'I thought I played well in 
the FA Cup semi-final second leg against Millwall in which we needed to 
win 2-0 to progress to the final.'

He
added: 'The worst game I played in was the second leg of the final 
against Leeds Utd where we were beaten 2-1 and lost the cup.'

The 38 minute-long film and the notes each player made were kept by the man who staged the media training and will go under the hammer on August 10.

Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, said: 'It is a fascinating video because it shows it wasn’t just football these young men were training in.

Paul Scholes, who has only just retired from playing for United, also practised his public speaking in the March 1993 video

Scholes's analysis said he'd played well when the team won and played badly when the team lost

The players, who went on to achieve worldwide fame with United, were part of the club's dominating youth team in the early Nineties. From left, coach Eric Harrison, Giggs, Nicky Butt, Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Scholes and Terry Cooke

'The club clearly felt that this crop of players were destined for the big time and felt that they had a responsibility to get them used to the cameras and speaking in public.

'The David Beckham footage is interesting. He spoke very commonly and had a lack of pronunciation to say the least, often using words like ‘I fink’ and ‘nuffink’.

'He must have given thousands of interviews since then and probably undergone some elocution lessons along the way to make him into the polished performer he is with the media today.'
