Daily Mail Online has learned that producers are cutting an extra length version for its home movie launch packed with steamy unseen sex scenes.

And for those fans who were left a little disappointed by the sex scenes shown on the big screen, the new takes are even kinkier.

Body heat: The two hour-five minute cinema version has roughly 20 minutes of on screen sex featuring leading stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson

More! Dornan and Johnson are seeking seven figure raises for Fifty Shades sequel

Dylan Neal, who plays Anastasia Steele's stepdad, confirmed extra scenes were shot and would be woven into the release, tentatively lined up for June

The two-hour five-minute cinema version has roughly 20 minutes of on-screen sex featuring leading stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who have both asked for seven-figure salary increases to do the sequel.

However, director Sam Taylor Johnson shot at least 10 minutes more of raunchy lovemaking and S&M scenes, which will appear on a Director's Cut. The news, sure to have fans clambering to buy the DVD following the huge box office success, was revealed to Daily Mail Online by movie actor Dylan Neal. 

Dylan, who plays Anastasia Steele's step dad, confirmed extra scenes were shot and would be woven into the release, tentatively lined up for June. Speaking in LA, Dylan, 45, said: "I would not be surprised if maybe there was some extras in the DVD release or the directors cut. 'When we were shooting it they were probably always aiming for an R (restricted) rating.

'But there was lots of stuff left in the editing room which would push it over into NC-17.' 

In the US Fifty Shades made an R rating meaning that under 17s can see the movie with a supervising adult. This NC-17 classification means that only those aged over 17 are allowed to view the content - and so would feature more explicit material. 

Dylan was blown away by the success of the movie - and says so were movie studio execs at Universal Pictures. 'It is just one of those phenomenons that happens every couple of years,' he said. 

'You start off with this book series that succeeded and part of the reason it took off is because the book series was one of the first digital downloads.

'And you could read this book on the bus without anyone knowing, and it fed upon itself - and then everyone had to see what the buzz was about. 'Then of course the movie was a feeding frenzy and this type of hype only comes around once in a while.

Hideous kinky: The Editor's Cut will feature ten more minutes of raunchy sex play

'I think the studio is really relieved that it has done so  well. And no-one anticipated that it would do so well.' However, American actor Dylan, who starred in Arrow and featured in Dawson's Creek, was not upset to have missed out on the romps.

'I was okay with leaving it to Jamie and Dakota this time round,' he said. Fifty Shades Of Grey is a staggering financial success worldwide.

It cost $40m to make, and has already earned more than $520m in revenue in less than a month. The DVD, home rental figures and future TV rights will swell that figure to a billion dollars. Punters saw seven total sex scenes, with three being in Christian Grey's Red Room.

There was around 20 minutes of total sex in the movie with eight spankings and ten whippings of Anastasia.
