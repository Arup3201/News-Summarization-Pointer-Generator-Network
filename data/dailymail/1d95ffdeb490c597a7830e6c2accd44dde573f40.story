At first glance these images might look like the product of digital trickery, but these these delicate shots are very much real.

French photographer Bertrand Kulik took the snapshots by photographing the plants through tiny raindrops in his garden from two inches (five centimetres) away using a micro-lens.

Among the flowers captured are daisies, passion flowers, cosmos and nasturtiums viewed through water droplets on leaves or other plants. 

The photos were taken by French photographer Bertrand Kulik in his back garden in Paris. Flowers include daisies, (pictured) passion flowers, cosmos and nasturtiums viewed through water droplets. Mr Kulik spends hours looking for the perfect shaped droplets and positions. This image is called Flower Smile

Mr Kulik, 34, said: ‘A few years ago when I was taking some pictures in my parents' garden, I saw some great reflections of our home inside drops of water.

‘With my camera, I tried to take some pictures, and I liked how abstract they were.

‘After flowers I thought it could be funny and interesting to take some other things. That's why I tried with different subjects. After my view, I tried to show my world.’

Bertrand creates the images by inverting a refracted image, which is seen through the water droplet. He said that the drops themselves act like tiny lenses, that are placed within the background.

Each of the delicate images were taken on a Canon MP-e 65mm lens from 2 inches (5cm) away. This image shows a poppy captured through a drop. Poppies are used as a symbol of peace and death. In Greek and Roman myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead. In Classical mythology, their scarlet colour signifies a promise of resurrection after death

Mr Kulik said: ‘I try to look for water droplets on flowers and sometimes I use a water spray to make some drops.But often, after the rain, it's not difficult to find a blade of grass with drops. I then look around for a flower or something else to catch the perfect angle.’ A daisy is captured in a water droplet on a passion flower

The photographer and concert violinist uses a Canon MP-e 65mm lens, which allows him to get up close with his subject.

He said: ‘It's very important to be very calm when using this lens because shaking is forbidden if you want a very good and clear focus.

‘It's like a sport because when we are very close to the subject, vibrations are stronger.

Another cosmos flower is reflected in a water droplet on the petal of a Lysimaxhia arvensis. Mr Kulik said he spends hours finding a real round drop, and position, to help create the perfect pictures

In this image, two sunflowers are visible on water droplets clinging to the bottom of a blade of grass. Sunflowers are part of the Helianthus genus in the Asteraceae family. The common sunflower, known as Helianthus annuus, is the most recognisable species

This is one of a number of images in Mr Kulik's collection that shows a passiflora, or passion flower, in a water droplet. They are part of the genus of plant that produces the passion fruit. Many species of the flower blossom for a single day each year

‘I have to be very zen! A good light is also very important, and for the picture to be pure and beautiful, it's very important to find a good flower.’

Mr Kulik spends hours finding a round drop to help create the perfect pictures.

He said: ‘The shape of the drop is important because if it is really round the picture inside will be clear. I try to take a series of pictures and then I will use the best one.'

'I love nature, and even in a big city it's possible to take some nice pictures of nature!' 

In this image, a daisy is reflected through the water droplet on a veronique flower. The daisy's latin name is Bellis perennis, which means 'pretty' and 'everlasting'. The name is said to have derived from 'day's eye' and in Medieval times, Bellis perennis was more commonly known as Mary's Rose

A pair of cosmos flowers are captured through droplets on a blade of grass. ‘Photography is a means of expression as well as music,' said Mr Kulik. 'Whether it’s a violin or a camera in my hands, the important thing for me is in search of colours and materials, and especially the desire to communicate to others what touches me'

This image shows a bunch of passion flowers reflected upside down in the droplet. One species of the passion flower, known as the maypop, has traditionally been used to make drinks that help relieve insomnia, hysteria, and epilepsy

‘Photography is a means of expression as well as music. 

'Whether it’s a violin or a camera in my hands, the important thing for me is in search of colours and materials, and especially the desire to communicate to others what touches me.

If I don't have my camera with me, everything I see in front of my eyes, I have missed.’

Other photos in his collection include his border collie Vanilla, a hen named Cinammon and even the Eiffel Tower, which can seen from his Parisien home.

Nasturtiums, like the ones seen reflected in the droplets of this image, descend predominantly from two species native to Peru. One was brought to Europe by Spanish conquistadors in the late 15th to early 16th century. A second species was brought to Europe in the 17th century by a Dutch botanist. Many parts of this species of flower are edible, and they have been used in cooking for centuries

The common name for yellow rudbeckia (pictured) is black-eyed Susan. It is the state flower of Maryland and has traditionally been used to symbolise justice
