Public confidence in MPs has slumped following the expenses scandal that shook Westminster, with just a fifth now believing most politicians tell the truth.

New research reveals that less than a third of the public see MPs as ‘competent’ or dedicated to doing a good job for the public, while almost a half say they are in it for personal gain.

The grim picture emerged in the latest research on attitudes for the Committee on Standards in Public Life.

Damning: Research has found that only one in five members of the public think most MPs tell the truth

The watchdog has been carrying out the polling every two years since 2004 - and while faith in the judiciary and police has remained solid, the ratings for the political class have slumped.

In general, just 59 per cent of the public said they had positive views about standards in public life, compared to 82 per cent in 2008, the year before it emerged that dozens of MPs had misused their expenses.

Nine years ago, 31 per cent of the public in England thought all or most MPs told the truth, but by 2010, after the parliamentary allowances crisis, the level had dropped to 20 per cent. It has not risen since.

Only around third or 31 per cent thought the majority did not use power for personal gain, with 45 per cent believing they did. But nearly two-thirds said all or most politicians would not take bribes.

Results: Latest research on public attitudes for the Committee on Standards in Public Life also showed that 45 per cent of the public thought MPs used their position of power for personal gain

Just 30 per cent of those surveyed believed most MPs were ‘competent’. Although this figure was up marginally from the 2010 figure, it is way down on the 40 per cent recorded in 2004.

The survey found only 27 per cent believed MPs were ‘dedicated to doing a good job for the public’ - down from 46 per cent the year before the expenses scandal.

Disgrace: The MPs expenses scandal - which saw Derek Conway, pictured, whose payments to his two sons first highlighted the abuse of the MPs expenses system - is the cause of the findings

The proportion convinced that all or most politicians make sure public money is spent wisely was anchored on 18 per cent last year - less than half its 2006 peak of 39 per cent, before the financial crash.

In 2004, 42 per cent thought a large majority of MPs set a good example in their private lives, but that fell to 22 per cent in 2010 and 20 per cent in the most recent results.

Liberal Democrat supporters tended to have significantly higher confidence in politicians than backers of the other parties. Some 56 per cent expressed trust in their local MP, compared to 46 per cent of potential Labour and Tory voters.

But supporters of all parties were more likely to have confidence in their local MP than MPs in general.

Dr Mark Philp, chairman of the Committee’s Research Advisory Board, said: ‘The dynamic nature of public perceptions of standards and trustworthiness has two important implications.

'One is that it is short sighted for commentators to dismiss these findings on the basis that “there will always be people who are disaffected or distrustful'.

‘The surveys provide evidence that public perceptions can improve in response to events in the public sphere, as was evident for the period 2004 to 2008.

'There is no reason to assume that individuals who are currently sceptical could not become more hopeful in their perception and evaluation of politics and governance.‘But it does require public officials to be seen as demonstrating the seven principles or public life - selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.’

If only half (half of WHO, may I ask) think politicians are in it for personal gain, then the other 'half' must be politicians and their families!

Our MP is pretty good; but I have less faith in politicians generally than I ever had - and I never had much...

The sad thing is that people still think we live in a democracy, we don't.  You will listen for the next two years about how Labour are going to do this, Tories are going to do that and Lib Dems are going to suck their thumbs and jump into bed with anyone who wins.  Then after you have weighed up who represents you best you vote.  That is where your democratic rights end because whoever get's into power will just do as they please and you have no more say until the whole rigmarole starts again after 4 years.  Most of you will forget that you were stitched up and will carry on just the same way, my dad always voted Lib/Lab/Con so I do, etc.  I want to see politics in this country ripped to shreds and the liars, charlatans and con artist (and worse) in Westminster brought to book.

80% might think politicians are 'in it for themselves' but most of them will still be good little sheep and vote for them rather than give another party a chance at the top job.

Less and less people trust politicians and the majority certainly don't according to this survey. For some reason the current political parties manage to still get elected with no group of sane middle of the road people able to form a cohesive group to stand against them. We have some fringe parties making ground, but they are either portrayed as loons or are in fact loons depending on your position. What sort of democracy do we live in where we can't seem to find satisfactory politicians to vote freely for?
