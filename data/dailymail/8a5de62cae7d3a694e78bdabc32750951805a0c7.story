Tragic: Jojo John, who was operating a boat that crashed on the Hudson River, has been charged with vehicular manslaughter and three counts of vehicular assault

The boat driver charged with killing a bride-to-be and best man in Rockland County, New York is believed by police to have been intoxicated as he piloted the doom vessel on the Hudson River on Friday.

Now, the sheriff’s department awaits a toxicology report to verify their belief and determine exactly what had 35-year-old Jojo K. John intoxicated enough to smash into a construction barge, killing two and injuring three others.

John was charged with felony vehicular manslaughter and three counts of felony vehicular assault from his hospital bed on Saturday and his charges were based upon eyewitness accounts. He will now presumably face an additional manslaughter charge after the best man Mark Lennon’s body was found Sunday, a day after bride-to-be Lindsey Stewart’s.

The news that John was likely intoxicated came as police revealed that the Nyack, New York man has an arrest record for a previous offense involving drugs, though the exact nature of the charge has not been released.

'At this point, we have probable cause to believe he operated the boat while intoxicated, and that's the basis for the charge,' Rockland County Undersheriff Robert Van Cura told ABC News.

The body of bride-to-be Stewart, 30, was pulled from the Hudson River on Saturday afternoon, floating with no life vest near the Tappan Zee Bridge, around 25 miles north of New York City.

Mark Lennon, also 30, who was to be 
best man at the wedding in only two weeks time, was discovered by a person on a recreational watercraft a mile downstream from where Stewart's body was found. He wasn't wearing a life vest.

Stewart's
fiancé, Brian Bond, 35, was 
knocked unconscious and fractured an eye socket after the bridal party's
powerboat struck a parked barge while crossing the river at 10.30 pm on
Friday.

The crash 
happened shortly after the 21-foot Stingray left the village of Piermont
for a short trip across the river to Tarrytown, authorities said.

Four other people, including the groom-to-be, were hospitalized with serious injuries after being pulled from the damaged boat.

Authorities
have declined to identify the other two boat passengers, saying they're
considered witnesses to a crime. One of them has been released from the
hospital.

NBC reported that the victims have head trauma and broken bones, but they are awake and are giving information to investigators.

Bond was knocked unconscious in the crash but later woke and was able to call 911, Stewart's mother Carol said.

Carol said earlier on Saturday that she was praying for a miracle. Lindsey Stewart was to be married on August 10.

The bride-to-be's mother told ABC: 'She's supposed to be married two weeks from today. It just can't end like this.'

Lindsey Stewart's stepfather, Walter Kosik, said the couple have known each other since they were 10 years old and used to go to church together.

'They have been friends the whole time, and they fell in love about 3 1/2 years ago,' Kosik said.

Accident: The powerboat crashed into a barge on Friday night

Scene: The accident happened near the Tappan Zee bridge, around 25 miles north of New York City

They were to be married at the Good 
Shepherd Lutheran Church in Pearl River, with a reception at a Hudson 
Valley winery, he said.

The New York Daily News reported that alcohol is being investigated as a potential cause for the crash. 

According
to the paper, the bride-to-be worked as an art teacher in 
Westchester County while her fiance worked in insurance in Nyack.

Rockland County Sheriff's Department 
Chief William Barbera said the barge, one of several loaded with 
construction material for an
upcoming replacement of the bridge, was equipped with lights, but it 
was still difficult to see on the water so late at night.

Desperate: Authorities conducted a three-hour search for the two people on Friday night and the hunt resumed on Saturday morning

Ring: The pair were planning to get married on August 10

The cause of the accident is under investigation.

The New York State Thruway Authority, which is overseeing the bridge project, said it was reviewing safety procedures.

'Our
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during 
this difficult time,' the authority said in a statement. It added that 
the lighting on the barges appeared to be functioning normally.

Pile driving that had been scheduled to take place Saturday was suspended because of the accident.

Anthony Apolito, 18, a restaurant valet, saw the survivors being carried ashore by emergency services.

He told the New York Post:
'There was a lot of people that didn't look too conscious and a lot of 
people in neck braces. One guy, his face was covered in blood.

'They were still stunned from the crash, they didn't know what was going on,' Apolito added.

There are a number of barges located both north and south of the Tappan Zee bridge as construction begins on a replacement for that aging structure that is scheduled for completion in 2017.
