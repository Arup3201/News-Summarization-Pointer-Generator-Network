Spied on: English teacher Kim Shaw was followed by private detectives for three days after she went on stress-related sick leave

Private detectives were paid £3,600 by a school to spy on a suspended English teacher who had taught there for 28 years.

English teacher Kim Shaw, 56, was followed by a professional private surveillance team for three days after she went on stress-related sick leave, an employment tribunal heard today.

Mrs Shaw, who taught English at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, near Caerphilly, South Wales, was suspended after allegations about ‘irregularities’ in her GCSE student coursework.

She was suspended for discussing it with colleagues and was accused of a ‘breach of confidentiality’, the tribunal in Cardiff heard.

Mrs Shaw went on sick leave for stress-related conditions following her suspension.

She was then spied on by Caerphilly Council officials, who paid the private security team.

Mrs Shaw said: ‘They said I couldn’t have been stressed because I was wearing shoes with flowers on them.

‘They photographed me out shopping with my husband. I think they were looking for something to besmirch me with.

'They even followed my husband to the Post Office.’

School headmaster Robert Davies told the tribunal he had no knowledge of the surveillance operation until after it had happened.

But he admitted being asked by Caerphilly Council to provide a photograph of Mrs Shaw but he had not questioned why.

Colin Adkins, of teachers’ union NASUWT who represented Mrs Shaw at the hearing, compared the council to ‘the Stasi', the feared secret police of the former East Germany.

Mrs Shaw was dismissed from her job in September 2012 after two years under suspension and is claiming unfair dismissal by her employers.

The tribunal hearing in Cardiff continues.
