Hein Verbruggen will be asked by the UCI to resign his position as honorary president of cycling's world governing body after an independent report accused him of colluding with Lance Armstrong and other riders to conceal doping offences.

The man who stood as UCI president between 1991 and 2005, and remains in a senior position in the organisation as well as an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee, was accused of being complicit in one of the biggest cover-ups in sporting history in an independent report into cycling's doping past.

Here at the UCI headquarters in Aigle today the current president of the organisation, Brian Cookson, said he would be writing to Verbruggen personally to call for him to stand down.

Verbruggen (left with Lance Armstrong in March 2003) is alleged to have interfered in doping issues to protect his star riders such as the disgraced former American superstar

'I am very concerned by what I have seen in the report and I will be writing to him asking him to consider his position as an honorary president, which was awarded to him by the Congress of the UCI when he retired as president,' said Cookson.

'Not everything Hein did was bad or wrong. He built this organisation into a strong organisation. But clearly, as is shown in report, decisions were made at that time which were about protecting the reputation of the sport rather than the integrity of the sport.

'There were serious errors of judgement and Hein really should consider his position now.'

If Verbruggen refuses Cookson said it would then become a matter for the UCI Congress.

'The UCI Congress was the body that awarded him that status and maybe it would be that they reconsider that in September,' he said.

Cookson also accepts the CIRC report is right to suggest that doping remains a serious problem for the current professional peloton.

'One of the things it says is that things have improved substantially in terms of doping in cycling,' said Cookson. 'But it does still say that there is room for further improvement.

'I think what they have said is a pretty accurate reflection. But there is some interpretation there. There are a whole range of contributions, some of which have been picked up by the media. For instance, one person said 90 per cent of the peloton is still doping. Others have said the problem is much much less than that. I'd like to think that it is the latter rather than the former. But there will always be people who will cheat.'
