Singer Morrissey, who claims he has been asked to appear on an episode of the Archers

Morrissey has revealed he has been approached to appear on The Archers.

The former Smiths frontman is a vegetarian and vocal opponent of the livestock industry and has been known to ban meat products from venues at which he performs.

Morrissey, 55 next week, is ‘fascinated’ by the offer, according to the website he uses to air his views.

The singer, pictured, is understood to have been approached about a potential idea for a storyline for the rural soap, which has had a number of celebrity cameos over the years.

The most recent visitor was cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins who made an appearance to coincide with Sport Relief in March.

The Duchess of Cornwall was on air three years ago and Princess Margaret featured in the show 30 years ago.

The BBC declined to comment, though it usually remains silent on plot developments in the Archers.

Morrissey’s website explained to fans unfamiliar with the show: ‘The Archers is the most popular show on Radio 4 and is considered a British institution.’

But a BBC radio publicist got into the spirit by posting a message on Twitter which echoed the lyrics of Smiths hit Ask, which said: 'We don’t comment on future plots so please don’t ask us ask us ask us.'

The singer, whose Smiths albums have included Meat Is Murder, issued a new single this week called World Peace Is None Of Your Business ahead of his first new album for five years being released.

The former Smiths frontman, is said to be fascinated by the offer according to his website

He won acclaim last year for his memoir Autobiography and has told how he is going on to write a novel.

Just days ago he was mobbed by fans as he appeared at a gig in California and had to leave the stage.

Last year the long-time Archers editor Vanessa Whitburn stepped down from the show and has been replaced by Sean O’Connor, who had previously worked on EastEnders and Hollyoaks as well as spending time as a theatre director and film producer.
