Olympic diver Tom Daley has launched his first official calendar and admits that he plans to try modelling in the future. London 2012 bronze medallist Daley, 18, appears in a variety of poses - some of them shirtless and covered in water.

But Tom has said his soon-to-be-released 2013 calendar is 'almost a bit of a mick take.'

He said: 'The one on the front cover where I’m covered in water was really funny to do.

Someone had to pound a bucket of water over me, it wasn’t cold, it was sort of lukewarm. It took a few takes to get to get it right through because the water needed to be in the right place.'

Tom Daley's calendar is the third biggest seller of 2012 - despite being launched less than a month ago

He continued: 'I’m going to give it to all my friends at Christmas, it will be a funny present. My friends all think the calendar is really funny. It’s a mick take almost. It’s the first calendar I’ve done and it was good fun. I really enjoyed it and I just hope people like it.

'Apparently the Calendar Club said there is a lot of interest in it.

'It really just sums up my year. There are a couple of Olympic-themed pictures so it’s a good souvenir too.'

Hot: Daley shows off his saucy side in these images from his 2013 calendar

Although the 18-year-old might look as 
if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, some of the shots featured in the 
calendar reveal that he has a saucy side.

Among the photos are several shirtless shots, including one that sees him wrestling with a turquoise fine knit jumper.

Unsurprisingly though, Tom, of 
Plymouth, Devon, says his favourite picture falls on his birthday month 
of May, which shows him receiving his bronze medal at the London 2012 
Olympics.

In total, nine of 
the twelve photos show off his toned, tanned torso, although three are 
action shots.

The remaining images show off Daley's conservative sense 
of style, including a scrubbed up shot of the diver sporting a lilac 
cotton shirt.

Although Daley has never modelled in an 
advertising campaign, he's no stranger to editorial photo shoots and has
 posed - in varying states of undress - for numerous British magazines 
and newspapers.

That's more like it! Daley as we're more used to seeing him
