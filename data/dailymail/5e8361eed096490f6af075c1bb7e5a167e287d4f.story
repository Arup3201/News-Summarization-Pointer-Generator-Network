Celtic are poised to join the race to lure Ghana World Cup winger Christian Atsu from Chelsea for a loan spell.

Parkhead boss Ronny Delia has confirmed that the Scottish champions are in the market for a wide man.

And 22-year-old Atsu is wanted by a raft of clubs in England, Spain and Germany for a year-long loan deal after spending last season at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland.

Top star: Atsu impressed on the wing for Ghana at the World Cup in Brazil

West Ham United and Aston Villa are known to be interested in the left winger, with Hamburg and Espanyol also linked.

But Celtic, who were linked with Atsu before he quit Porto for Stamford Bridge in a £5million deal last summer, hope the possibility of Champions League football could sway a player who started all three of Ghana’s World Cup games in Brazil.

Atsu enjoyed a successful loan spell in Holland, scoring five goals in 28 appearances - but has ruled out a return to the Erevidisie this time round.

Sought after: The young winger's performances have made him a loan target for a number of clubs

Celtic fly to Iceland this lunchtime ahead of tomorrow night’s Champions League qualifying first leg tie with KR Reykavik, Deila’s first competitive match in charge.

The Icelandic club’s midfielder Atli Sigurjonsson admitted yesterday that his team mates have been so busy concentrating on playing Celtic that they have allowed their form to slump.

KR Reykjavik were stunned by struggling Thor in their last game in the league before they face Deila’s side.

And Sigurjonsson believes his side have been guilty of dwelling too much on their Scottish opponents ahead of the sell-out clash.

Experience: Atsu spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse and Celtic hope they can be his next club

He said: ‘Perhaps the thought of playing Celtic has been disrupting our form.

‘It will be fun to play Celtic and we are all looking forward to it.

‘I don’t think our form has been too bad - we just let ourselves down in our last game.

‘We are a good team and although we recognise it will be tough against Celtic, we are confident we can give an excellent account of ourselves against a team as big as them.’

Youngster: Ronny Delia is hoping he can convince the player Celtic once tried to sign to come to Glasgow
