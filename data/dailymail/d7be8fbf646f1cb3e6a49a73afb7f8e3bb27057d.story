This remarkable footage shows the moment a ‘senseless’ reveller who was fuelled by drink and drugs jumped into the path of an oncoming train forcing it to slam on its emergency brakes.

CCTV footage shows how the train came within just inches of hitting Nathan Barker after he jumped onto the railway line at Bentley Station in South Yorkshire.

The 21-year-old, who was under the influence of drink and drugs at the time of the incident on March 18, delayed 12 train services for over 90 minutes by standing on the tracks.

In the CCTV footage, Nathan Barker, 21, can be seen waving his arms in the air and staggering around on the railway line for several minutes before a train approaches

The 21-year-old, who was under the influence of drink and drugs at the time of the incident at around 10pm on March 18, was described as 'senseless' for climbing onto the railway line

The footage shows him stood on the train tracks at Bentley Station in South Yorkshire as the train hurtling towards him slams on its emergency brakes

In the footage he can be seen waving his arms in the air and staggering around on the railway line for several minutes before a train, which was hurtling towards him, slams on its brakes.

However, Barker seems unfazed by the near-miss and remains on the track until the train driver, who emerges from the front cab, appears to shout at him.

He then pulls himself back up onto the platform before lying on the floor – where he is later arrested for obstructing the railway.   

His actions were described as ‘senseless’ by British Transport Police after he was jailed for 16 weeks at Doncaster Magistrates’ Court.

Sergeant Steve Down, of British Transport Police, said: ‘The driver of a train arriving at the station had to apply the emergency brakes when he spotted Barker stood on the train tracks with his arms in the air.

Sergeant Steve Down, of British Transport Police, said: 'The driver managed to stop the train in time and asked him to get back onto the platform but he refused and stayed there until police arrived'

‘The driver managed to stop the train in time and asked him to get back onto the platform but he refused and stayed there until police arrived and arrested him for obstructing the railway.

‘His behaviour can only be described as senseless.

‘Not only were his actions extremely dangerous but they also caused 12 trains to be delayed for over 90 minutes, costing the rail industry hundreds of pounds and inconveniencing the travelling public.

‘I welcome the custodial sentence and hope it sends a clear message to others that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable.’

After being spoken to by the train guard, Barker pulls himself back up onto the platform before lying on the floor - where he is later arrested for obstructing the railway

His actions were described as 'senseless' by British Transport Police and he was jailed for 16 weeks at Doncaster Magistrates' Court after admitting an offence of obstructing the railway
