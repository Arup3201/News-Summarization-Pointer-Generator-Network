 For years Tim Henman and Andy Murray have put fans through sporting torture on a giant screen situated just metres from the live action at Wimbledon.

Now ticketless London 2012 supporters are set to go through the same torment as organisers announce plans for a giant screen  in the heart of the Olympic park where up to 10,000 people can catch all the drama.

The woodland area, to be known as Park Live, is yet to be given a nickname but possible options are 'Hoy's Hill ', 'Mo (Farah's) Mound' or even 'Radcliffe's ridge'.

Spectacle: Park Live will feature a giant screen which is the size of two double-decker buses. Up to 10,000 people will be able to soak up the atmosphere in the shadow of the Olympic stadium

Other alternatives mooted include Pendleton's Park after Gold-medal winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton and Dai Greene's Fields in honour of Welsh champion hurdler Dai Greene.

The majority of the GB team is yet to be selected, leaving the final decision on a nickname open until the big stars of British sport have been confirmed.

The space will boast a giant double-sided screen in the River Lea and a 'natural amphitheatre' that has been sculpted especially for the event.

It will be staffed by 1,000 British Airways' 'BA Hosts', made up of volunteers from the airline and their families, and spectators can watch athletes being interviewed on the presentation stage.

Lord Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said: 'Whether it's 'Halsall Hill', 'Pistorius Park' or 'Dai Greene Fields', our plans for Park Live will create a green and colourful place for fans to cheer their heroes and soak up the Olympic Park atmosphere.

'With lush lawns surrounded by wildflower meadows and rustling reeds, a trip to Park Live will be a truly unforgettable experience.'

Park Live will feature timber 
seating, frog ponds, loggeries, wildflower meadows, woodlands, 
tree-lined footpaths and reed beds with over 30 species of native reeds,
 rushes, wet wildflowers and irises.

It
 will be open from early morning to late evening for spectators to visit
 before and after sporting events and organisers have also outlined 
their ambition to open it up to people without tickets for a stadium 
event.

Olympic gold 
medal winner Denise Lewis said: ‘It looks like it could be the 'Henman 
Hill' of the Games. I know the athletes, their families and guests at 
the Olympic Park will be thrilled to have a dedicated place for people 
to come together.’

Once the planning process is concluded in the coming weeks, construction work will start on the temporary double-sided 14m high, 132 square metre screen, which is the height of three double-decker buses and will sit on a purpose built structure on the river bed.

Alongside live sporting action, Park Live will feature a host of other activities including live entertainment, short films on the creation of the parklands and visits from Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

Set in the newly created wetland bowl in the north of the Olympic Park the area will feature non-drinkable recycled water provided by the new Thames Water Old Ford treatment plant.

It will be the UK’s largest ever urban river and wetland planting project with 300,000 wetland plants grown on the Gower peninsula in Wales and Thetford in Norfolk.

More than 30 species of native reeds, rushes, grasses, sedges, wet wildflowers and irises will also feature, with around a third grown from cuttings and seeds collected from the Olympic Park before construction started.

The green oasis will also host wildlife habitats including frog ponds, loggeries, wetlands, woodlands, irrigation ditches, fish channels for spawning, otter holts, kingfisher nests, bat boxes and strips of Toadflax planted to attract the rare Toadflax Brocade caterpillar. 

The armed forces have begun preparations to help with security during the Olympics with marine commandos yesterday holding a huge security exercise off the south coast to show off their strength ahead of the Games.

Weymouth
 and Portland in Dorset will play host to the sailing where the 
Albion-class amphibious assault warship HMS Bulwark will play a key role
 in protecting the events.

The Navy gave a rare glimpse of its 18,500-ton flagship, along with its marines in action.

Rapier surface-to-air missiles
 have also been showcased at Blackheath Army Cadet Centre, in south east
 London, as part of the massive 2012 security test on land, sea and in 
the air.

Colonel Jon 
Campbell, commander of the Joint Ground Based Air Defence, said: 'We 
have done as much as we can to allay people's fears.

'The Rapier system has a world-class radar on it and is particularly good at picking up low and slow-moving objects in the sky.

'It means we're able to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of London.'

Air
Vice Marshall Stuart Atha added: 'We want the focus to be on Usain Bolt
this summer and not us. We're very proud to be part of this plan to 
deliver a safe and secure Olympics.'

The
Lexington Building in Tower Hamlets and the Fred Wigg Tower in Waltham 
Forest, both in east London, have been identified as potential sites for
the High Velocity Missiles.

Rapier missiles would be positioned 
on Blackheath Common and in Oxleas Wood, both in south east London, and 
at William Girling Reservoir Chain in Enfield and Barn Hill at 
Netherhouse Farm in Epping Forest, both in north London, should the Air 
Security Plan be approved by the Government.

Col Campbell said the sites had been chosen to avoid having weapons inside the Olympic Park.

He said: 'We're trying to 
de-militarise this and let the sport do the talking. The Lexington 
Building is the best available location away from the Olympic Park.'

'When you launch a Rapier missile and 
shoot down an aircraft, it's not like the whole thing vanishes. It's 100
tons of metal, scraps, and other stuff that is coming down,' said Jan 
Wind, a retired Dutch Navy captain who is director of the Hague-based 
Wiser Consultancy.

'If a 
Rapier is used, the damage could be just about the same as the 
intentions of the terrorist - only on another spot. The goal of the 
terrorists will be met in a certain sense,' Wind said.

It's
rare for the British military to publicise the location of its weapons,
but the military says it hopes that any potential attacks will be 
deterred by showing the missile strength and other defense assets such 
as Typhoon fighter jets.

Ground-to-air missiles have been a 
fixture of Olympic games and large VIP events in the post-9/11 world, 
but London's missiles have sparked outrage among residents of an 
apartment block who learned that the Rapiers might be stationed on their
 roof.

They say the missiles
 are creating a climate of fear - which security experts say is exactly 
the point. That's because the systems are more valuable as deterrents 
than as deployed weapons, Mr Wind said.

'The
 British army and air force don't do all this to really shoot down a 
terrorist aircraft, they do it to display their determination to do so, 
which will hopefully prevent the terrorists from attacking,' Mr Wind 
said.

'If you know that there are 500 policeman outside the jewellery store, you will not go there and try to rob the store.'

The Ministry of Defence it has not decided where it will ultimately station the missile batteries.

Meanwhile as Olympic fever grows stills from the final instalment of the animated film featuring mascots Mandeville and Wenlock have been released.

The movie tells the story of the pair who were born when two drops of molten steel feel as building work finishes on the Olympic stadium.

Once cooled they are picked up by a man named George.

Back home he decides to make a gift for his grandchildren out of the steel drops.

The two children take the mascots up to the attic and place them on the windowsill when a rainbow forms going through the house.

The rainbow brings Wenlock and Mandeville to colour and to life where they learn about sport from the children, posters and the TV.

The story which features GB Olympic athletes ends with the words: 'Then suddenly the rainbow disbanded; Wenlock and Mandeville know it’s time to go, their journey is just beginning. So many adventures to have, so many people to tell, but they will meet again; in London, in 2012. They’ll be there, You’ll be there, the whole world will be there.'
