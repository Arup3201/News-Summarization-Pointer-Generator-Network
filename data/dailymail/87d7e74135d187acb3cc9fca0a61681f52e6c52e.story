Amateur pilot, Jason Osu, was murdered by two assassins who lurked outside his home in Liverpool

A murder inquiry was launched today after a man died almost a week after he was shot while sitting in his car outside his home.

Jason Osu, 31, suffered multiple gunshot injuries in the attack on his driveway in Liverpool, last Monday night.

The amateur pilot was taken to hospital but died in the early hours of today, Merseyside Police said.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the cause of death.

Merseyside Police's Major Investigation Team is leading the investigation, working alongside the force's dedicated gang crime unit, Matrix.

Detective Superintendent Mike Shaw said: 'This was a brutal murder where a man has been targeted outside his home.

'It happened very close to Queens Drive, one of the city's major roads, at a very busy time and we are hoping that there are people out there who may have seen something.'

Detectives are looking for two men who 
may have been waiting in Beauclair Drive, in Wavertree, for up to 40 
minutes before they opened fire on Mr Osu.

It
is thought the men, dressed in dark anorak-type jackets and balaclavas,
then escaped in a dark-coloured hatchback car, possibly a stolen black 
Citroen C4, which was found burning nearby in Waldgrave Street shortly 
after the attack.

Mr 
Shaw added: 'There will be an increased police presence in the area in 
the days to come, and I would ask anyone with information about the 
murder to talk to officers or call the incident room.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
