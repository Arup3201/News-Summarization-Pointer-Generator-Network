A debt-ridden Romanian man proved to be unlucky in love after trying to sell his virginity for £700 - and failing to receive a single offer.

Seb Ciercies was left baffled by the lack of interest having described himself in a local newspaper as 'Athletic, toned and dark-haired'. 

The 29-year-old virgin conceded that he was 'no Brad Pitt' after his money-making plan flopped - but expressed surprise that nobody wanted to 'try out' his 'great body'.

Mr Ciercies had announced his intentions to sell his virginity to any takers in Brasov, a city in central Romania - making it clear that transport was 'not included'. Keen to secure an early sale, he did not specify whether buyers should be male or female.

He wrote: 'Man, 29, Brasov. Athletic and toned, dark haired. I'm selling my virginity. Price: 850 Euros. Transport not included.'

But weeks after placing the advert, aimed at clearing mounting debts, Mr Ciercies was still no closer to abandoning his virtue - and had not had even one response from a potential buyer.

He said: 'I don't understand it. I'm a good looking guy with a good physique. I thought someone might even offer me more.

'I'm healthy, I'm no Brad Pitt but I'm not ugly either. I forgot to specify male or female in the ad and I didn't even get any gay takers.

'It doesn't do much for your self-esteem to be rejected by absolutely everybody in the world.'

Seb took out the ad to pay off debts he has run up through unemployment and having to care for his diabetic brother.

He said: 'I've worked hard in the fields and in farms all my life. It's tough work but it has given me a great body. I thought people would be keen to try it out.'
