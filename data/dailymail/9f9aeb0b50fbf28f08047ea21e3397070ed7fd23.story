These are the pictures showing the 'horrendous' conditions passengers are being subjected to at Heathrow - a sea of stressed travellers in queues stretching half a mile through the airport.

Crowds enduring the two and a half hour wait to get through immigration were photographed last week growing irritable as the airport swelled.

Adding to their frustration, they were met with empty passport control desks and uninterested staff, according to the Daily Telegraph. And airport staff even said to have tried to stop them from taking pictures to try and keep the mess under wraps.

The chaotic scenes raised concerns over a 'perfect storm' as an extra 650,000 visitors arrive in the country for the Olympics at the height of the holiday season.

Thousands of athletes descending on Britain from across the world over the next three weeks will also only to the pressure on the immigration system, the responsibility of the Home Office.

The Immigration Service Union, which represents 4,500 border staff, said that the present problems were being made worse as only about half the current workers were fully trained to allow passengers from anywhere in the world entry.

The Olympics visitors will also arrive at the peak of summer when hundreds of thousands of families are taking foreign holidays, further adding to the strain at the airport.

One businessman who was waiting in the non-EU line said he had to wait more than two and a quarter hours on Friday. He had been returning to Britain from Italy and arrived at 8.30am but did not make it through immigration until 11am.

Adding insult to injury: Passengers facing agonising waits can only look on at the infuriatingly empty immigration desks. Staff were even said to be unhelpful during the crowded situation

'I have never seen anything like it,' the man, who did not wish to be named, told the Telegraph.

'If they think they are going to be ready for the Olympics, which is now less than a month away, then this was a very poor training exercise – and it wasn’t even busy.'

Airport staff are said to have tried 
desperately to ban restless passengers from taking pictures of the 
scenes. But many people were still able to record the situation using 
camera phones.

Despite the long delays at immigration, Heathrow seemed to be going to great lengths to welcome athletes arriving in the country.

A series of Olympics greeting desks 
manned by five members of staff have been rolled out across the 
airport.

Yet when some passengers walked past them on Saturday evening, the staff were standing idle as they waited for athletes to arrive over the next few weeks.

The bright pink 'accreditation' desks 
have been placed in four terminals to allow athletes to collect their 
passes for the Olympic village. The desks do not deal with immigration 
and athletes have to go through the same procedures as members of the 
public.

They are manned 
by Olympics officials and Heathrow staff. There will also be 1,000 volunteers in bright garments scattered throughout the airport in the run up to the Olympics to help athletes.

BAA admitted today that recent immigration queues at Heathrow were 'unacceptably' long.

The
airport operator said the Home Office had promised all Border Force 
desks at Heathrow would be manned during the peak Olympics arrival 
times.

But it added that the Home Office should be 'delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as Olympic visitors'.

A source within the organisation said that staff levels would be higher during the Olympics because contingency plans did not start for another two weeks.

They admitted 'minor' breaches of queuing time through immigration but claimed extra staff had been rolled out.

Under its targets, the Border Force must get non-EU passport holders through immigration at Heathrow in less than 45 minutes for 95 per cent of the time.

A Border Force spokesman said:  'We are fully prepared for the busy Olympic period and will be implementing well-rehearsed plans. This includes staffing all immigration desks at key ports whenever necessary.'

The target for EU passport holders at Heathrow is less than 25 minutes for 95 per cent of the time.

A BAA spokesman said: 'Immigration is a matter for the Home Office. The Home Office has said that from July 15 all Border Force desks at Heathrow will be open during peak arrival periods.

'Immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at Heathrow in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the Home Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as Olympic visitors.'

Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said that the Home Secretary had assured Parliament that the full summer capacity would be in place by now.

He added that Britain cannot afford the 'queues or the lax security'.

 

Thousands of drivers in the capital are bracing themselves for gridlock.

But it will be a far speedier affair for athletes and Olympics guests zipping around the capital.

The high-profile guests will travel glide through the busy streets using these Olympics Games Lanes.

The road marking were painted last night and adjustments to traffic lights will begin this week,The Olympics Rings-marked lanes, which run alongside lanes for general traffic, will only come into operation on Wednesday July 25 - two days before the Olympic opening ceremony, with 'ordinary' drivers allowed to use them until then.

The lanes have been dubbed 'ZiL lanes' after the Russian-built ZiL car that carried Soviet Union leaders around.

There will be 30 miles of Games Lanes in London, with the lanes forming part of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network (ORN) which links Games venues.

Variable message signs along the lanes will state that drivers will be able to use them until July 25, although Transport for London (TfL) is advising motorists to avoid central London around the ORN and Games venues from mid-July.

The exception to the free-to-use rule will be the Games Lane on the M4 near Heathrow which will start on Monday July 16 as the 'Games Family' - athletes, officials and the world's media - begin to arrive in big numbers.

Before that there will be a reversal of traffic flow in the Kingsway Tunnel at Aldwych in London to assist traffic flows while on Friday July 20 further ORN work will be carried out, including the installation of barriers to simplify junctions.

When the ORN and Games Lanes come into full operation on July 25, they will be enforced from 6am to midnight daily.

Gridlock: Drivers will endure scenes such as this across London while Olympics cars glide effortless through the traffic

Up to one million extra visitors are expected in London on each day of the Games and there will be up to 1,300 'Games Family' vehicles an hour travelling between key venues.

A penalty charge of £130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations, including driving in Games Lanes or stopping along the route, and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £200.

The Games Lanes will end around two days after the Olympics finishes on August 12 and will not be in operation between the Olympics and Paralympics.

A smaller Paralympic Route Network will come into operation shortly before the Paralympics start on August 29.

Having dedicated routes to events became an Olympic priority after difficulties in the 1996 Games led to the venue in Georgia, USA, being dubbed 'the lost city of Atlanta'.
