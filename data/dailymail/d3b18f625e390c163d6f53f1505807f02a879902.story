A father has been arrested after he confessed to violently shaking his three-month-old baby because he was mad at a video game console.

Jerry Carrier, 26, faces two charges of first-degree assault after he exploded in rage and angrily shook the baby in two separate incidents in Newport and Charlestown, New Hampshire.

Police said that he confessed to shaking the newborn after he lost his temper with a  video game system.

Anger: Carrier, 26, faces two charges of first-degree assault after he exploded and angrily shook his three-month-old son twice

After the first incident in January an ambulance was called to a home for the three-month-old who was clearly in distress.

The baby was taken to New London Hospital and then released, WMUR 9 reported.

However, the next day, the little boy could not keep his food down and had to be admitted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire.

Two weeks later, Carrier shook the baby again.

The baby's distraught mother found the child unresponsive, blue and not breathing. 

Police responded for a second time to a house in Charlestown and the baby was taken to a local hospital where doctors said his injuries were found to be from 'non-accidental trauma.' 

The three-month-old is now in state custody. 

Meanwhile, Carrier is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. 

He was arrested earlier this month for a separate charge.

Treatment: The baby had to be admitted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire on one occasion after being shaken by his father
