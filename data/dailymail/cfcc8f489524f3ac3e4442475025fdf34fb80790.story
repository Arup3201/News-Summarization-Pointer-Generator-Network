La Liga outfit Valencia could be on the verge of being sued by DC Comics due to their apparent attempt at copying the Batman logo, according to reports in Spain.

Valencia have had a bat on their team crest since their formation in 1919 but that has not stopped the American comic book publisher from suing the Spanish side.

DC Comics are said to have become unhappy at Valencia trying to register an image of a bat with outspread wings as an official trademark.
