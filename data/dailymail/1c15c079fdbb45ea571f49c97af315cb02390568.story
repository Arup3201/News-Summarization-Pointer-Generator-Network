A seven-year-old boy battling brain cancer sacrificed his life to save his mother's by giving her his kidney.

Chen Xiaotian was just five when doctors found a malignant tumour in his brain, months before his mother Zhou Lu, 34, contracted kidney disease.

Despite early signs he would recover, the disease aggressively returned, and he was told he would not reach adulthood.

Tragic: Zhou Lu, 34, reads to her terminally ill son Chen Xiatian, seven, who went blind with brain cancer

Decision: Zhou battled chronic kidney disease for two years before her son said 'I want to save you'

The pair battled through together for two years.

Eventually, Chen told his mother: 'I want to save your life'.

Over time, both had become incredibly weak.

Zhou needed dialysis treatment, while Chen required round-the-clock care.

Towards the end, Chen lost his sight and became so weak he was bed-ridden, nearly paralysed.

Before: The pair were inseparable and battled through their debilitating illnesses together for two years

Diagnosed: Chen was told he had a brain tumour aged five and despite early signs of recovery, it came back

Zhou grew increasingly weak, and needed a kidney transplant to survive, and Chen wouldn't let her refuse his

Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, said: 'The doctors approached me rather than his mother because of the sensitive nature of the issue.

'They told me that my grandson would not survive but his kidneys could help his mother and also save two other lives as well.

'I discussed it with Zhou and she refused point-blank, she absolutely didn't want to hear any talk of that happening.'

The little boy, who became near-paralysed towards the end of his life, said his wish was to help Zhou

Distraught: Zhou, pictured after her operation, said her only consolation was knowing that, if her son had to die, a part of him would always be with her

But Chen overheard the dilemma, and demanded that his mother let him save her.

In tears, his mother agreed, saying that if her son was to die her only consolation was that part of him would live on in her.

Doctors confirmed that the tissue match was perfect and when he died on April 2, he was quickly moved to the operating theatre where his kidneys and liver were removed and then donated to his mother and two other people.

Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, was the first person doctors approached to say they would have to make the decision

Doctors had not been sure Zhou would be able to live a normal life, but they say early results show Chen's kidney will give her a miracle recovery

The second kidney went to a 21-year-old girl and his liver to a 27-year-old man.

Hospital spokesman Yi Tai said all three transplants were a success and that the youngster's death had allowed three others to survive and live normal lives.

He said: 'The medical team held a brief moment of prayer and silence for the poor child before the transplant, I think it's fair to say there were very few dry eyes.'
