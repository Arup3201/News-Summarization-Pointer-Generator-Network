Cheetahs may be the fastest land animals in the world, but this pair look more content riding a car.

Wildlife photographer Paolo Torchio held his nerve as a fully-grown mother and her juvenile son hopped on to the roof of his vehicle just feet away.

'I was already out from the hatch, and so we found ourselves sharing the tiny space of the roof with the two big wild cats,' he said.

'The female was looking around using 
our car as a perfect viewpoint to spot prey or threats while her son was
 curiously looking at us.

'He was so comfortable that he used one of the spare diesel tanks like a cushion to take a nap.'

Mr Torchio captured the images at the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, which is home to thousands of cheetahs.

This particular mother Malaika, who 
like other adults is capable of speeds approaching 70mph, is well-known 
in the area for hopping onto cars.

Mr Torchio, 52, who hails from Italy 
but now lives in Kenya, is well accustomed with the behaviour of 
cheetahs and says they are 'very polite and friendly' when not 
disturbed.

'Of course the emotion was high, very high,' he added.

'But slow movements and by keeping our
 voice-level low was enough not to scare them and escalate to a 
potentially dangerous situation.

'Wild animals should always be treated with full respect.'
