In an era where airlines rarely offer complimentary peanuts anymore, it's surprising that a captain would go out of his way to feed passengers on a delayed flight.

But that's just what one unnamed Frontier Airlines pilot did this week when he reached into his own wallet to pay for a round of pizzas.

The kind act happened on a flight from Washington, D.C. Monday night, bound for Denver.

Frontier Airlines flight 719 was scheduled to leave at 5:48pm, according to FlightAware.com, but didn't leave the tarmac until nearly an hour later.

Cool pilot: The captain of a flight from Washington, D.C. to Denver that was delayed five hours on Monday, bought his hungry passengers a round of pizzas as they waited on the tarmac after being diverted to Cheyenne, Wyoming

And the flight only went downhill from there.

As the plane approached the Denver area, they ran into a severe thunderstorm and the captain was forced to circle around the western Nebraska until the storm cleared.

But when the plane started to run low on fuel, it diverted to the airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming to wait out the bad weather.

After about an hour on the tarmac, the passengers were starting to get agitated in the hot Airbus A320.

His own money: When the plane was diverted to Cheyenne because of bad weather in Denver, the pilot decided to buy 50 pizzas for the entire flight

Hungry no more: Passenger Logan Marie Torres, who is also Miss Colorado United States Teen 2014, took pictures of the flight crew handing out the much-appreciated pizzas

That's when the captain realized that neither he nor the passengers had ate in quite a long time.

'The captain took his own initiative,' passenger Logan Marie Torres, and also Miss Colorado United States Teen 2014,  told KDVR.   'He said “Ladies and gentleman, Frontier Airlines is known for being one of the cheapest airlines in the US, but your captain is not cheap. I just ordered pizza for the entire plane.”'

The captain ordered 50 pizzas which were handed out to the appreciative passengers by the flight crew.

Miss Torres took several pictures of the flight attendants bringing the pizza boxes through the cabin to passengers with smiles on their faces.

The plane remained on the ground in Cheyenne for about two hours before finally taking off for Denver, arriving just before midnight - five hours late.

So far the captain of flight 719 has not been named, and MailOnline's calls to the airline have not been returned.
