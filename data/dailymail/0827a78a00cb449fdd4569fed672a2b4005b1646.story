Agony: Roy Parker, 67, waited almost an hour-and-a-half for an ambulance to arrive after he broke his shoulder and wrist

A pensioner seriously injured falling from a ladder waited nearly 90 minutes for an ambulance because the paramedics were on a lunch break.

As Roy Parker, 67, lay in agony after breaking his shoulder and wrist at around 11.30am, his neighbour dialled 999.

But paramedics did not arrive at his home in Solihull, West Midlands, until shortly before 1pm.

West Midlands Ambulance Service has written to Mr Parker’s MP, Caroline Spelman, apologising for its ‘error’ last month.

It admitted an ambulance should have gone but its crew was sent back for a meal break.

Mr Parker’s wife, Dorothy, 69, said: ‘I arrived home about half an hour after his fall. 

'My neighbour was with him. She thought he was going into shock.’

Paramedics had phoned to say they would be there as soon as possible but arrived one and a half hours after the 999 call. 

'The paramedics were fantastic. They could see how bad the injuries were, but it is deeply concerning that my husband was left in this state for so long ,; Mrs Parker said.

In the letter to Ms Spelman, West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'In summary we did have a vehicle to send but it was sent back for a meal break.

'Caroline, we can only apologise for this error and I know the chief has offered to write to the patient to apologise for our mistake.

'Clearly there was an error in handling the call and I am sorry for the distress this has caused. I hope you are reassured that a review is taking place into what happened.'

Meal break: It has since transpired Roy, 67, pictured with wife Dot, waited while the crew had their lunch

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance added: ‘The initial call suggested he had fallen about 4ft and had hurt his arm and shoulder.

'We were dealing with a 25 per cent increase in 999 calls, many of which were of a more serious nature.

‘As well as being the law, it is right and proper that we give our crews a break. If we didn’t... they would work throughout their 12-hour shift which would put lives at risk – both patients and staff.’
