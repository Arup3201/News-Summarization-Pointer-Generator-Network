Eating certain pigment-rich foods daily can contribute to building up the skin's natural barrier to the sun's harmful rays.

Particular fruits and vegetables such as dark purple berries and dark green veggies contain special protective compounds, and it's all down to their concentrated pigmentation.

Dermatologists and skin scientists at the 
forefront of photo-dermatology (the scientific study of ultraviolet 
light and its effects on skin) have made the pioneering discovery.

Eating certain foods can contribute to building up the skin's natural barrier to the sun's harmful rays

The body utilises the food's compounds near the skin's surface to give a base level of protection against damaging UV rays.

Known as a Continual Dietary-Sun Protection Factor (CD-SPF), this is the first time scientists have ascribed an SPF value to diets based on the nature and quantity of natural plant pigments.

One of the benefits of this approach is that all day long, even cloudy days when sun cream isn't used regularly, a 'base' level protection is supplied against the damaging effects of UV light.

Food Chemist and Nutritionist Dr Sam 
Christie explains: 'The level of protection against UV light can be 
assessed in a similar way to which  sun creams are rated e.g. SPF10 or 
20; where the higher the number, the greater the protection against 
damage from UV rays. By eating foods that protect your skin against UV 
rays you are effectively achieving sun protection at all times of the 
day and on all areas on your body.'

Dermatologist
 Dr Iaisha Ali notes: 'A Continual Dietary-SPF (CD-SPF) could be a 
useful tool alongside appropriate sun cream use in achieving healthy 
skin all year round. Furthermore,
 a form of base SPF from dietary and supplement sources would provide a 
degree of protection during relatively short sun cream-free times when 
invaluable Vitamin D production takes place naturally.'

Dr Sam Christie tells MailOnline: 'Plants themselves are the heroes here. It's a matter of multi mechanistic effects.

'The plant pigments in these foods gravitate to the skin where they are deposited.

'UV light hitting the skin is slightly dissipated by the molecules the foods provide. With the right amount their energy isn't passed onto our delicate DNA.

'They help the skin cope with UV light by suppressing the damaging effects of sunlight, neutralising free radicals and reducing redness and inflammation.

'They can also help with the 
anti-ageing skin effects on an extra-cellular level. The glue that holds
 the skin together - mucopolysaccharides - is where collagen exists. The
 health of that material is dependent on the type of food you eat. You 
see relatively more severe wrinkling in people who eat less of these 
fruits and vegetables.

'Plus they help with other more severe harm from the sun.

'When
 light falls on the skin these plant compounds can help combat 
photo-immuno suppression – if left unchecked this stage can lead to the 
initiation and development of cancer cells in the skin.

'In
 essence these multi-protective plant materials give the body the tools 
it needs to help protect its delicate DNA from sun damage.’

Sun creams should not be used to increase sun exposure time but to increase protection

But to 
obtain SPF 10 from diet alone, you would need to consume a portion of 
kale and almost a kilo of black seedless grapes daily.

While eating these 'super' foods contribute to protection from the sun's harmful rays, very few people actually eat enough of them on a daily basis to achieve a base level CD-SPF through diet alone.

Colladeen®
 Visage from naturesbest.co.uk, the first supplement that can provide skin with SPF, provides a
 potent source of plant compounds for an average SPF 10 achieved after 
12 weeks of use.

Sam
 explains: 'While Colladeen® Visage will never replace the effectiveness
 of a high SPF sun cream, it provides an all-year-round 'base' SPF and 
the potential for reducing the long-term ageing effects of sun 
exposure'.
