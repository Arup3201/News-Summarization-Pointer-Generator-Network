They have taken to the celebrity jet-set lifestyle of Los Angeles with considerable ease.

But despite clearly enjoying life in California, it appears the Beckhams could be about to move after David announced last night that he will play his last game for the Los Angeles Galaxy next week.

The
iconic midfielder will attempt to help his team win their second 
consecutive MLS Cup in the league final against Houston Dynamo on 
December 1.

While that 
will be the final act of his impressive six-year career in LA, the 37-year-old 
former Manchester United player insisted he would not retire and said he
was hoping for 'one last challenge'.

Speculation over his next destination is
likely to rage over the next few days, with Paris, Australia and his 
native London all possible new homes for the English legend.

Last week, he pointedly denied rumors linking him to a short-term stint in Australia.

'I've had an incredibly special time playing for the L.A. Galaxy,' Beckham said in a statement on Monday evening.

'However, I wanted to experience one last challenge before the end of my playing career. I don't see this as the end of my relationship with the league, as my ambition is to be part of the ownership structure in the future.'

Beckham and his wife, former Spice 
Girl Victoria, seem comfortable in Los Angeles, where their three sons -
Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz - attend school.

The footballer is a fixture in the Los Angeles Lakers' courtside seats, attending his most recent game with his three sons last Friday.

He has played six years in Los Angeles since his groundbreaking move from Real Madrid - building on a worldwide fame that reportedly produces more than $40 million per year in endorsement income.

He has reached three league finals and winning one MLS title last year during his best season stateside.

He agreed to a two-year contract 
extension with the Galaxy in January after playing out his initial 
five-year deal, turning down potential moves to Paris St Germain and 
other clubs.

Beckham had not given any overt indications he was planning to leave the Galaxy after this season.

'Seldom does an athlete redefine a sport,' said Tim Leiweke, the president of Galaxy owners AEG. 'David not only took our franchise to another level, but he took our sport to another level.

'It has been an honour and privilege to be a part of his world, and more importantly, to have him be a part of ours.'

Beckham has been the star player on 
the league's most glamorous franchise during his tenure, which began 
with a handful of rocky seasons before the Galaxy became a power under 
coach Bruce Arena over the past few years.

'In
my time here I have seen the popularity of the game grow every year,' 
Beckham said. 'I've been fortunate to win trophies, but more important 
to me has been the fantastic reception I've had from fans in L.A. and 
across the States. Soccer's potential has no limits in this wonderful 
country, and I want to always be part of growing it.'

Beckham began his professional career with 12 years at Manchester United before his move to Real Madrid. He left for the Galaxy in 2007.

Beckham played in three World Cups and made a record 115 appearances for England, but wasn't chosen for the Olympic team at the London Games last summer.

Beckham still played a role in the Olympic festivities, including a prominent part in the lighting of the Olympic flame in his native east London during the opening ceremonies.
