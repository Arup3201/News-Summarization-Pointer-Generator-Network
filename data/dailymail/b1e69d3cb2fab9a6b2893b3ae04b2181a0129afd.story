It is the perfect solution for shopaholics who are running out of room for all their fashion purchases.

The Dynamic Closet is a rotating wardrobe that catalogues your clothes and can deliver your chosen item at the click of a smartphone or tablet.

Instead of rifling through overloaded hangers and rummaging among fallen items before finding something to wear, the garment is produced instantly.

The wardrobe is operated on a circular rail meaning it can store more clothes than a normal wardrobe, in the same amount of space.

The innovative system involves taking pictures of an item on a smartphone or tablet before placing it in the wardrobe.

Sensors on the rails then detect which space the item is allocated and catalogues it.

When the owner searches for it on their smartphone, the wardrobe automatically moves the rail to the correct place to bring them the outfit.

The device’s creators say users can search by pictures, colour, type...or even the date the item was last worn.

The concept was first suggested in the 1995 film Clueless in which Cher had a computer system to pick clothes

The concept was first suggested in 1995 film Clueless, in which character Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone, had a computer system to help her decide what to wear.

It labelled items a match or mismatch, enabling her to create outfits.

The real-life wardrobe comes in a range of finishes, including gold leaf and silver leaf, and makers MetalProgetti also offer to create a bespoke design.

A basic version of the futuristic furniture costs £2,900, while a double-level model is priced at £4,300.

MetalProgetti’s Amanda Tarbart said the product was ‘a very simple solution to a very real problem and is a great idea for anybody who is serious about their fashion’.
