Believe it or not, 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of Comic Relief – and yesterday celebrities including Samantha Cameron were getting into the spirit of Red Nose Day.

The Prime Minister’s wife posed for photographs with her 11-year-old daughter Nancy, who was painting her face as Larry, the Downing Street cat.

In a rare interview yesterday she said the charity was ‘close to my heart’, and revealed that her family made £200 for Red Nose Day last year, saying: ‘Biscuits, flapjacks, scones – the kids and I cooked for days.’

She also gave an insight into their life behind closed doors, crediting her husband with being a ‘good cook’ and praising him for making an effort to join the children at breakfast and bedtime. 

But she joked that she was still trying to ‘train’ him to ‘pick up his clothes’.

Painting a picture of a normal family life, she talked about the school run, cinema trips, play dates at Number 10 and doing ‘quite badly’ at school quiz nights. 

And in the interview with The Sun, she said she was ‘proud’ of her husband, and ‘desperately’ wants him to win the election in May, but added: ‘Obviously it will be up to the British people.’

The Prime Minister's wife also posted for a selfie with David Walliams. Mrs Cameron said she was 'proud' of her husband and 'desperately' wants him to win the election in May
