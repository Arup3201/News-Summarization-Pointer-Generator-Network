Game of Thrones on Blu-Ray: The new discs offer sharper HD resolutions which are supposed to look better on televisions

It was supposed to be the technology that revolutionised how we viewed films in the home.

Blu-Ray was hailed for its superior sound and picture quality, as well as the multitude of additional features available on the discs - a fact that is reflected in the price.

But it seems that many people can’t in fact tell the difference compared with DVDs when watching the film.

Some 39 per cent of those questioned said they simply couldn't tell a difference in picture quality.

The new discs offer sharper HD resolutions, which are supposed to look better on televisions.

But even after six years on sale, they remain unpopular next to lower-resolution DVDs.

On top of that, 81 per cent said they did not even have a Blu-Ray player and were still using DVDs.

Many will feel the difference in quality is not enough to justify the difference in pric, with Blu-Rays usually selling for around £20, while DVDs can be bought for as little as £4 these days.

The poll results will be embarrassing for Sony which spent millions developing Blu-Ray technology.

It has been the next generation video technology of choice since 2008 when it beat Toshiba’s HD-DVD in a battle which recalled the war between VHS and Betamax over video players.

But tech bloggers have long speculated that past a certain point viewers just don’t care about the extra quality and don’t want to pay a premium for it.

A poll of 1,348 British consumers found they are yet to be convinced by Blu-Ray technology and 53 per cent think that it is overpriced.

Their concerns appear to be justified - on Amazon.co.uk a DVD copy of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is £12.97 whilst the Blu-Ray version is £15.

The poll also found that of the 19 per cent of people who have bought into Blu-Ray technology own just three discs.

Even extras such as 3D (this Samsung player is capable of playing 3D Blu-Rays) have failed to ignite public imagination

By contrast, 38 per cent of all people who were quizzed said they owned more than 100 DVDs.

A further 44 per cent said that they own between 70 to 100 DVDs.

Those who are prepared to buy into Blu-Ray do indeed get a far superior picture.

Blu-Ray’s maximum screen resolution is 1,920x1,080 (1080p), while DVD is limited to 720x480 (480p).

Blu-Ray has richer colours and more contrast because it uses superior video-compression methods.

It also has better audio and more features such as menus you can access whilst your film is playing. Normally with a DVD you have to stop the film first.

The study found that another reason for the lack of take-up is the rise in online film streaming services which means people are buying fewer and fewer hard copies of films

The poll was carried out by MyVoucherCodes.
