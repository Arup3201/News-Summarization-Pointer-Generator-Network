Five Royal Marines have been charged with murder over the death of an injured Taliban fighter last year.

Royal Military Police officers arrested the troops after video footage was found on a Marine’s laptop that allegedly showed members of 3 Commando Brigade discussing what to do with a wounded gunman caught inside a compound in Helmand.

The images are said to have been discovered after one of the soldiers was arrested by civilian police who were investigating an unrelated crime in the UK.

The five Marines, who have not been named, remain in custody. The next stage is likely to be trial by court martial.

A further four Marines questioned about the death have been released without charge.

Details of the incident have not been
 revealed but the Ministry of Defence described it as ‘an engagement 
with an insurgent’ with no civilians involved.

It is claimed that the injured Taliban fighter did not pose a threat to the Marines.

This is the first time that UK soldiers have been charged with murder during the 11-year conflict in Afghanistan.

Strict rules of engagement, largely derived from the Geneva Convention, dictate how British troops treat the enemy.

The incident has been described as ‘an
 engagement with an insurgent’, with no civilians involved.

It is 
claimed the man did not pose a threat to the troops.

The Service Prosecuting Authority 
(SPA), an independent body that conducts prosecutions on behalf of the 
military, decided the five should face murder charges.

Bruce Houlder, the director of service prosecutions, will oversee the next stage of the process.

The tour, Operation Herrick 14, was 
the unit’s fourth and saw the force score notable successes in capturing
 explosives from the Taliban.

But 23 servicemen from 3 Commando 
Brigade lost their lives during a summer tour of duty that encompassed 
the height of the fighting season, while many more were injured.

Rules of engagement, largely 
derived from the Geneva Convention, dictate under what circumstances 
British troops are allowed to open fire, whether that is to prevent an 
attack by the enemy or in direct contact.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was determined that the rules of engagement were followed in Afghanistan.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: 
‘Everybody serving in theatre knows the rules of engagement, they carry 
cards in their uniforms with the rules on them in case they should need 
to remind themselves.

‘I can’t comment on the specifics of this case.

‘We are very determined that rules of 
engagement will be followed, that any abuse will be dealt with through 
the normal processes of service justice and that is happening now.’
