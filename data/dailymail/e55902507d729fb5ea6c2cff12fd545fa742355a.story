This is one adrenaline junkie who isn't afraid of winging it.

Footage has captured the heart-stopping moment a wingsuit flyer navigates his way through a narrow gap in rocks at speeds reaching 160mph - and it's not for the fainthearted.

Daredevil Robert Morgan, also known as Scotty-Bob, recently took to the skies above the Great Basin Natonal Park in Utah and cut through the air in his specialist wingsuit.

The jaw-dropping video was uploaded to 
YouTube and has become an internet hit with more than 60,000 clicking to
watch the video in four days.

The clip shows Scotty-Bob jumping off a cliff before weaving his way through the famous 'Beehive Line' gliding just feet away from rock faces.

First he free-falls before descending into the narrow gap at an alarming speed.

But the thrill-seeker, who travels the globe jumping, pulls off the stunt safely and flies directly through the opening of rocks before his parachute opens.

Wingsuit flying athletes slice through the air using a special jumpsuit which adds surface area to the human body to enable a significant increase in lift.

He then flew towards Mount Jianglang, which stands at 900ft, and zoomed through a fissure that measured between 15 and 60 feet in width and three football fields in length.

The daredevil had just four-feet of space either side of him and deployed his parachute just 300 feet above the ground. 

First developed in the late 1990s, the suits allow people to glide through the air subject to the wind.

People using wingsuits often jump from base exit points or from skydiving aircraft to give them enough altitude to fly for up to five minutes before they land.

A wingsuit is also known as a squirrel suit or birdman suit.

It is made up of two arm wings and a leg wing supported by the use of inflatable pressurised nylon cells.

The person wearing the suit uses his or her body to control forward speed, direction and lift.

It can take years of practice to be able to use a wingsuit correctly.

A good wingsuiter can achieve speeds as low as 25mph which is 80 per cent lower than a regular skydiver and horizontal speeds of up to 220mph.
