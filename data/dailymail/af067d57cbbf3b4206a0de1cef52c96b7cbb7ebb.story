A mother has fled from her home in northern Italy to Syria with her six-year-old son - apparently lured to the war-torn country by ISIS promises of money in return for children.

The woman, who is Albanian by birth, is understood to have left Barzago for Syria in December with the boy, leaving her two young daughters and husband behind. 

Her husband believed she had been enticed by the promise of financial rewards for women who have babies with ISIS soldiers, Italy's TGCom24 reported.

The Albanian woman left her home in Italy with her young son (not pictured) for Syria in December, enticed by ISIS's promise of financial rewards in return for having children they can turn into jihadists. ISIS's use of children was highlighted in this video - which may have been staged, above - showing a young boy executing two 'Russian spies' by shooting them in the back of the head

The so-called cash-for-babies promise was given as the reason women from at least three Somali families in the States were lured to the country, according to The Times.

The group is said to want young children who they can train up as Jihadists - like the boy who was seen 'executing' two alleged Russian spies this month.

La Repubblica reported the husband, who it names as Afrim, followed his wife - referred to as 'V' - and son to Syria hoping to get them to return home with him. 

But his desperate search ended when was unable to reach them, although it has been reported elsewhere he has located her by phone. 

He revealed he had watched her gradually turn into 'a sister of Jihad' in the months before her flight from Italy, where she had lived since 1995. 

Pictures of the six-year-old being looked after two women in ISIS-held territory are also said to exist, but have not been released. 

The woman's husband has tried to get her back by following her to Syria - but he was unable to find her once he got to the country

Akrim has now approached the police for help, and her case is being investigated by police in Italy.

V is the second Italian woman known to have gone to Syria to join the extremist militants:  

Maria Giulia Sergio, who is married to an Albanian,  is understood to have left for the country in September with her husband.

The Local reports the 27-year-old now goes by the name of Fatima Az Zahra.
