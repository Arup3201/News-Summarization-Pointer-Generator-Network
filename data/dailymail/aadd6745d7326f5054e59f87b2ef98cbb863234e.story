Roger Federer will face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the Rogers Cup final after a comfortable 6-3 6-4 win over Feliciano Lopez on Saturday.

The 17-time Grand Slam champion was seldom troubled in his semi-final victory and will pursue a third Toronto title against the Frenchman.

Federer was dominant, though he needed 11 break points to pick up the two he needed against the Spanish left-hander.

The serve statistics were telling, Lopez's double faults outnumbering his aces while Federer had just one set against 13 aces.

The Swiss star even had chance to show off his trademark between-the-legs shot in a second-set rally that ended with him blazing the ball wildly into the crowd.

He has won 11 of his 15 career meetings with Tsonga, though the latter has two wins over Federer in Canada and also knocked him out of last year's French Open, in straight sets, and Wimbledon 2011 where he came from two sets down.

Federer is not taking the threat of Tsonga lightly and said: 'He can overpower guys, serve up a storm and then play really aggressive with his forehand and also be solid in his backhand.

'You think you're in a safe place in the rally, and he takes one step and just hits it and the point is over. That's why he's been in the top 10 for so long.'

Earlier in the day, Tsonga had defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-3 to reach the final.
