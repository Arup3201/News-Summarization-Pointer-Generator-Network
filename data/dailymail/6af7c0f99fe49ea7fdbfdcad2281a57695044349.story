 A new crackdown has been launched against the estimated six millions drivers who fail to declare endorsements on their licence when taking out car insurance.

Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) show that 16 per cent of the UK's estimated 35 million motorists fail to disclose their driving record accurately, including disqualifications and serial speeding convictions.

The deception is usually committed by drivers who fear their insurance policy may be refused or made too expensive if they told the truth. However, if they have an accident, the failure to declare can make their policy invalid.

Around 16 per cent of the UK's estimated 35 million motorists fail to disclose their driving record accurately which includes disqualifications and serial speeding convictions

Recent figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) suggest that last year some 180,675 attempts were made to obtain cheaper cover by providing false information or withholding details such as past convictions - equivalent to nearly 3,500 every week.

This adds on average an extra £50 to every household's annual insurance bill. 

The ABI said examples of fraudulent applications include a motorist with a poor credit rating tried to use an alias to buy motor cover, an applicant failing to disclose four previous claims and an unspent motoring conviction which had led to a 3 year prison sentence. Another driver attempted to alter his driving licence to remove driving convictions.

The new licence-checking system called 'MyLicence' involves a partnership between the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The two groups will supply a data-sharing service to the motor insurance industry with insurers able to use accurate information about drivers' records to assess risk and prevent fraud at the point of quote or renewal.

It was developed in partnership with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in response to the Government's Insurance Industry Access to Driver Data programme and the DVLA's aim to digitalise the data it holds.

The money raised by insurers from the crackdown could be use to cut up to £50 from the premiums of honest law-abiding motorists and reduce the bills of over two million motorists who make the mistake of 'over-declaring' convictions that may be spent.

But insurers say the system will not spot the millions more drivers who tell 'little white lies' to cut the cost of their premiums – such as stating a vehicle is parked in the driveway when in reality it is parked out on the road.

A spokesman for ABI said it will allow the motor insurance industry to have 'instant access to accurate driving history data' via a secure MIB hub and the use of a driving licence number.'

She added: 'The MIB Hub is expected to receive and respond to tens of millions of insurer requests each day and will enable insurers to capitalise on the advantages of using accurate data to assess risk and prevent fraud at the point of quote or renewal. '

ABI policy director and deputy director general Huw Evans added that the new system was the latest in a series of legal reforms designed to crack down on fraudulent insurance claims and practices which had led to the motor insurance claims system being branded as 'dysfunctional' and Britain 'the whiplash capital of Europe' by MP watchdogs.

Transport minister Claire Perry said: 'MyLicence is good news for motorists and good news for the motor insurance industry.

'This Government is investing in the service which will allow insurers to price much more accurately and should reduce premiums for honest motorists.' 

Janet Connor managing director of AA Insurance noted: 'Insurers are getting better at detecting both claims and application fraud where those applying for cover are 'economical with the truth'. Yet the number of attempts to make a deceitful buck from insurers shows no sign of falling.

She added: 'These are serious issues for the industry and it's not acceptable that the majority of honest people have to stump up to pay for the dishonesty of others.'

Julie Daniels, head of motor Insurance at comparethemarket.com said: 'Any efforts to increase accurate information being provided to insurers can only be good news for consumers as this should help lower motor premiums.

'I believe that there will be little material change in premiums until the My Licence initiative is used across the industry and would therefore encourage take up.' 

She said: 'Driving down motor premiums is a priority for the insurance industry and the government. It is vitally important that running a car remains affordable as an increasingly mobile society means that families are working and living further apart – so as well as the practical, everyday benefits of car ownership, there is the social advantage of better connectivity to friends and family.'
