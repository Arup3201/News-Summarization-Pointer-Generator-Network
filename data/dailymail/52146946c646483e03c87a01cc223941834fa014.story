It is no coincidence that advances in keyhole surgery ten years ago led to a steady rise in the number of people deciding to donate a kidney. The operation, which can be performed via an incision so tiny that it can be hidden in the belly button, was carried out 1,068 times in 2012 - almost three times the number a decade ago.

Yet one of Britain's leading transplant surgeons now argues that a back-to-basics approach to open surgery - using fingers as well as surgical instruments - offers the best outcome for donors and transplant recipients.

The  technique, known as finger-assisted nephrectomy, has been pioneered by Professor Nadey Hakim

The technique, known as finger-assisted 
nephrectomy, has been pioneered by Professor Nadey Hakim. It reduces the
 operating time from between two and three hours to just 45 minutes, and
 according to new research, the donor is at lower risk of complications.
 The reduction in operating time also means the kidney is fresher for 
transplant and there is less chance of the organ being damaged during 
retrieval.

Prof Hakim's unit at Imperial College Healthcare Trust in London is the only one of 30 UK transplant centres to use this method. A handful of European surgeons are also adopting his approach.

Twenty years ago, all kidneys were removed using a large incision up to 8in long. Then, following the introduction of keyhole surgery, up to five smaller incisions were required, each measuring about 3in.

During finger-assisted nephrectomy, a 1½in incision is made below the ribcage for removal of the kidney. The surgeon then uses his fingers to manoeuvre the kidney into a position where it can be removed, using instruments to separate it from the connective tissue that holds it in place. Once this is done, the organ is lifted out with  the fingers.

'With keyhole surgery, you are making 
four or five holes for the instruments plus a 3in incision to remove the
 organ,' explains Prof Hakim. 'Complications include accidental injury 
to the bowel or a blood vessel which can damage the kidney itself. 
Getting the organ out of the patient itself takes longer once you have 
separated the kidney. And the longer the kidney remains disconnected 
without cooling, the greater chance of delayed function.'

Finger-assisted nephrectomy means that the organ is 'on ice' a matter of minutes after it is separated from its blood supply.

'Patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision'

Prof
 Hakim adds: 'Keyhole surgery is a fine technology, but it is not 
without risk and there are still merits in old-fashioned open surgery.

'Obviously both are an advance on the very large incision - as big as 8in - that we used to use in the pioneering days of kidney transplantation where everything inside was laid out for the surgeon to see.

'We have had only very minor complications with this approach and the patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision and very speedy recovery once they have left hospital. And making it safer and more comfortable for the donors will hopefully get more people to step forward.

'With nearly 6,000 patients on the kidney waiting list, anything that may increase the number of donors is to be welcomed.'

Historian David McDowall, 68, decided to donate one of his kidneys to a stranger last year. The father-of-two from South London was delighted with his small scar and the fact that he was able to resume normal activities within a month of the procedure.

Dr
 Bessam Farjo, hair transplant surgeon and medical director of the 
Institute of Trichologists, says:

'While the root of a hair is alive and
 can produce brand new hair, the end of the hair - made of the protein 
keratin - isn't alive and can't repair itself. When damaged, the fibre 
of a single hair can split into two or more and wither away. This occurs
 due to chemical treatments, heat or chlorine, vigorous brushing, or 
just wear and tear. Cutting your hair every six to eight weeks is the 
only solution to preventing this.'

Mr McDowall, who had his surgery last autumn, says: 'I decided to donate after surgeons at another hospital saved the life of one of my grandchildren - I wanted to give something that might help save another life. No one in my family needed a transplant, so I decided to donate to a stranger. My recovery was very fast. Six weeks later, it was if I hadn't had surgery at all.'

Nicos Kessaris, a transplant surgeon at Guy and St Thomas' Hospital in London, says Prof Hakim's technique is widely admired. 'There's no doubt that he is a highly skilled surgeon and there is no reason why this technique couldn't be used at other centres,' he adds.

'My view is that both techniques - keyhole and finger-assisted nephrectomy - are safe. I use a variation called hand-assisted nephrectomy where the incision is about 3in and you put your whole hand in to remove the kidney.

'But the vast majority of retrievals are made by keyhole surgery. I think that being able to give the patient a choice is a good idea.'

Mary Hart is a US television personality with great hair. But in 1991 her singing apparently caused a woman to suffer a seizure. An epilepsy expert suggested it was the pitch and quality of the sound causing the problem. It has long been known that pulses of certain coloured lights could cause epileptic fits, but this was the first known case to have been caused by the sound waves of a television broadcast.
