The website blamed for the death of Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her

The brothers behind Ask.fm have announced a ‘full and independent’ review of the site last night, amid mounting pressure in the wake of a teenage girl’s suicide linked to the website.

The Latvian-based site makes around £5million each year in advertising aimed at its 60million registered users, but a string of tragedies have been blamed on it, including that of 14-year-old Hannah Smith last Friday.

Founders Mark and Ilja Terebin said last night: ‘We recognise the importance of acting quickly and decisively to ensure our users and their parents do not lose confidence in our social network.’

They have engaged the London  law firm Mishcon de Reya to conduct ‘a full and independent audit’ of the site and its safety features.

Lawyers and media specialists will carry out a detailed investigation into the procedures and policies in place, and report back with findings and recommendations in the next seven days.

Hannah was found hanged in her bedroom after suffering months of abuse by bullies on Ask.fm who urged her to kill herself, cut herself and ‘drink bleach’.

Her father David Smith, 45, from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, has accused the site of ‘making millions out of people’s misery’ and called for it and similar websites to be properly regulated.

The Terebins yesterday repeated an earlier claim that they wanted ‘to provide a safe environment for our users’.

‘We are committed to safeguarding against bullying and harassment in all forms and would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with our colleagues across the industry to do this,’ they said.

The Terebins, the wealthy sons of a Red Army officer, have also promised to hand over details of her abusers after Prime Minister David Cameron urged parents, teenagers and advertisers to boycott the site.

Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, was discovered dead the day after posting a heart-breaking message online

In an open letter they wrote: 'Although it is possible to post anonymously to the site, we would like to reassure parents that in almost all cases it is possible for Ask.fm to identify users – through IP technology, everything on the internet is traceable – and in extreme circumstances such as those we’ve experienced this week we work through existing legal frameworks to ensure this information is accessible to the appropriate legal authorities.'

Firms such as Vodaphone, Laura Ashley and Specsavers as well as charity Save the Children pulled their adverts yesterday. 

The open letter came hours after the Prime Minister urged the Terebins, and those running similar sites, to ‘step up to the plate and show some responsibility’.

Mr Cameron also urged parents and teenagers to avoid using the ‘vile’ websites.

Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts

He told Sky News: ‘Just because someone does something online, it doesn’t mean they’re above the law. If you incite someone to do harm, if you incite violence, that is breaking the law, whether that is online or offline.

‘Also, there’s something all of us can do as parents and as users of the internet and that is not to use some of these vile sites. Boycott them, don’t go there, don’t join them – we need to do that as well.’

But some experts believe a ban is too simplistic. Holly Seddon, of parenting and technology website Quib.ly, told The Times: 'Even if (ask.fm) was taken down, there are many other avenues for online and offline bullying.

'There is a danger that if we just fixate on one product, we are not having the conversations we should have, whether that is in the government or with our kids.'
