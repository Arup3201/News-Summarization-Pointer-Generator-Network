Playing with a toy car's remote control in his doting brother's arms, it is hard to believe that just weeks ago brain tumour patient Ashya King was being treated in intensive care.

Though bearing a faint scar on the back of his head from his brain surgery, the five-year-old was almost unrecognisable as the desperately ill child seen being wheeled into hospital on a stretcher in early September.

The little boy finished a course of pioneering proton bean therapy last month, and last week was seen with his family in Marbella, Spain, as he continues his recovery.

Brothers in arms: Five-year-old Ashya King plays with a toy car's remote control as he is carried by his brother Naveed in the grounds of the Marbella High Care Hospital in Spain

Ashya and his family were seen at the Marbella High Care Hospital in Spain, where he has been treated since leaving the hospital in Prague, Czech Republic, after undergoing proton therapy.

He looked intently at the remote as he was carried by older brother Naveed; his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, not far away as they pushed his younger sister in a buggy. 

In August, Ashya was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged.

They were traced to Spain where, at the request of the British authorities, they were put in prison and the five-year-old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family members allowed to see him. 

The Kings had planned to sell a holiday home in southern Spain to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have, but which was refused by the NHS in England.

However, after a dramatic U-turn in events, they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre which had agreed to treat Ashya.

Worry: His parents have said it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough, and instead took Ashya back to Spain for further treatment

NHS England later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad. 

After six weeks at the hospital, during which he received 30 rounds of the treatment his parents hope will be life-saving, Ashya left Prague at the end of October.

However, his parents said  it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough.

Instead, they planned to continue Ashya's treatment in Spain. 

Speaking after Ashya left hospital in Prague, Mr King told Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain.

Recovery: After taking his first tentative steps, Ashya was wheeled out of the centre in Prague ahead of his family's move to Spain. The youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment

We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us.

'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us.

'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.'

Happy: Ashya was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother

Medics who had been treating Ashya in Prague said that having arrived at the hospital on a bed by ambulance, by the time he left he was able to sit on his own, and play with toys.  

The specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment.

During Ashya's 30 visits to the centre he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine to ensure the tumour he had removed had not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was.

He previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on July 24 and a further operation on his brain on August 22.
