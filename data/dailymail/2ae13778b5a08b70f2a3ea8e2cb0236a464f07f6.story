A Tumblr user has claimed that every female character used in a Disney or Pixar film in the last decade has the same face. 

The post by Every-Flavored-Bean on the Something Classy blog was uploaded after they saw stills from the new film Inside Out - and noticed the similarities between the women's faces.

They then combined a number of characters from recent productions and traced around their cheeks and noses - apparently proving the similarities.

They suggested that every female character from the last decade is a 'descendant of some primordial creature' with 'huge round cheeks and a disturbingly small nose'.

They then go on to say that the reason behind the similarities is 'lazy sexism'. 

The user wrote: 'So when I saw this picture for the new Pixar movie Inside Out, at first I thought the characters were three women and two aliens, but after seeing the trailer I realized the purple and red things were supposed to be dudes. 

'After tracing their faces, I figured out why I was so weirded out: The two male characters have extremely distinctive face shapes, while the three female characters basically have the exact same shape; round with a small nose.

The allegations follow on from claims made by Frozen's head of animation, Lindo De Salvo, in 2013 who said creating the female characters was tricky because you have to 'keep them pretty.'

They did the same with male faces and noticed that most of them were different 

They first spotted the distinctions when looking at stills from the new animated film Inside Out

According to a Tumblr user, he said: 'Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, because they have to go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty and they’re very sensitive to — you can get them off a model very quickly.

'So, having a film with two hero female characters was really tough, and having them both in the scene and look very different if they’re echoing the same expression; that Elsa looking angry looks different from Anna being angry.'

A Disney spokeswoman reacted to the controversy by saying: 'Animation is an intricate and complex art form. 

'These comments were recklessly taken out of context. As part of a roundtable discussion the binaries was describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animations females versus males or other characters.'
