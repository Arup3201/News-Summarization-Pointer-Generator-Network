The British government accused Argentina of ‘intiimidating’ British cruise liners near the Falkland Islands, it emerged yesterday.

Six such incidents, where protestors or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted cruise liners bound for the Falklands, have occurred in the past two months.

Foreign office minister Hugo Swire blamed militants from Argentina for the threats, and condemned their actions saying they should allow passenger liners to travel safely to the islands.

Rising tensions: Argentina has been accused of 'intimidating' British cruise liners headed for the Falkland Islands

It is understood that last month, the British Government ‘formally summoned’ the Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro to protest against the incidents involving thousands of passengers since mid-November.

A fresh wave of fresh protests by Argentine nationalists was launched yesterday at two cruise liners docked in Buenos Aires after visits to islands, known in Spanish as Las Malvinas.

Protesters accused the Star Princess and the Seabourn Sojourn of stopping at provinces across the region, including the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, in violation of a provincial law.

The controversial ‘Gaucho Rivero’ law which is active in five provinces, prohibits British ships involved in the ‘exploitation of natural resources’ around the Falklands from docking.

Mr Swire, the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs minister, said in the response to the information from a parliamentary question: ‘We condemn unequivocally any efforts to intimidate companies from pursuing their lawful business.

‘The British government deeply regrets that elements in Argentina have recently taken action aimed at disrupting cruise ships that visit the Falklands.’

The Foreign Office last night said there had been around six incidents in recent weeks.

They include officials refusing permission entry Argentine ports or delaying ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking offices of shipping companies and scheduled cruise itineraries either altered, or abandoned, to appease locals.

Tensions escalated between Britain and Argentina this week after Cristina Kirchner, Argentina’s president, published an open letter to David Cameron again calling for the region to be returned to her Government’s control.

The FCO has accused Argentina of trying to strangle the islands’ economy, which earns £10million from cruise ship tourism which employs around a quarter of the working population.
