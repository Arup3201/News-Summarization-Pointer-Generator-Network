A video has revealed the dramatic moment when police used pepper spray to break up a group of Polynesian men and boys performing a traditional dance after a high school football game.

Police in Roosevelt, Utah, are being accused of overreacting after a pair of officers had tried to disperse a dozen or so performers blocking an exit after the Union-Uintah game on Thursday night.

The Haka dance has been popularised by rugby players in New Zealand who chant, beat their chests and gesture aggressively before matches.

Haka: Police in Roosevelt, Utah, are being accused of overreacting after a pair of officers had tried to disperse a dozen or so performers blocking an exit after the Union-Uintah game on Thursday night

The Maori tradition also can include fierce facial expressions. Haka dances are now performed at football and rugby games around the world.

The group in Roosevelt, a town of 8,000, had travelled around 125 miles to watch a relative play his final game for Union, who lost to rival Uintah and finished the season without a victory.

They were trying to boost Union's morale with the Haka as the players left the field, reported the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune.

Spectators, coaches and players told police everything was fine and they should let them perform, said witness Jessica Rasmussen. But officers told them to make room and began using pepper spray.

Ms Rasmussen said she and other bystanders also got spray in their eyes, ears and mouths. Union fan Jason Kelly said the way police reacted was an embarrassment to the community of Roosevelt.

'I've never seen anything like it. It was totally unprovoked'

‘I've never seen anything like it,’ Mr Kelly said. ‘It was totally unprovoked.’

Police said the incident is under investigation - and anyone is welcome to lodge a complaint. They said many people in the crowd knew the group was going to dance, but the two officers did not.

Spectator Shawn Mitchell said while he did not view the dancers as a threat, the impromptu performance might have played a role in how police responded.

‘If they're going to do something like (the Haka), maybe some planning could be done ahead of time,’ Mr Mitchell said.
