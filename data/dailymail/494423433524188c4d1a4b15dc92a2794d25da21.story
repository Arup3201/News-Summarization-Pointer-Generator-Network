Police turned away hundreds of protesters yesterday at the site of a genetically modified crop experiment.

Officers prevented the activists from entering the field of chemically altered wheat, which they had planned to pull out of the ground.

Two men were arrested during the demonstration, which had been arranged to ‘decontaminate’ land being used by scientists trying to produce GM wheat that deters pests.

The trial’s opponents claim the crops could contaminate the surrounding environment, as the experiment is being carried out in the open air.

St Albans City and District Council applied to the Home Office for greater police powers in anticipation of the protest, and an order banning activists from Rothamsted Research’s site in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, was issued on Friday.

Those operating under the name ‘Take The Flour Back’ said 400 members sat in front of officers guarding the wheat field and sang protest songs for half an hour before gathering in nearby Rothamsted Park.

Police stressed that despite the two arrests there were ‘no disturbances in the area’, but claimed there were only 200 protesters present.

Aphids – greenfly and blackfly – are the bane of farmers’ lives because of the damage they do to plants by feasting on the sugars in their leaves.

The wheat grown at Rothamsted  releases a chemical that greenfly recognise as an 'air raid warning' of an attack by a predatory parasitic wasp.

Scientists hope it will keep aphids away and attract wasps to further control the pests.

They say it is a ‘natural’ form of GM, which could stop farmers having to use toxic pesticides and could also be used in other plants.

The gene that produces the chemical, was taken from a peppermint plant and inserted into the wheat crops.

A message on Take The Flour Back’s website said: ‘This open air trial poses a real, serious and imminent contamination threat to the local environment and the UK wheat industry.’

However, Professor Maurice Moloney of Rothamsted Research insisted that the chance of any cross-pollination was minuscule.

‘We have no idea who is advising them scientifically because it is absolutely incorrect,’ he said.

The organisation’s GM wheat, which was planted last month, has been developed with genes from the mint plant.

Professor Moloney explained: ‘The wheat produces a volatile chemical which the aphids don’t like and it makes them go elsewhere.

‘The purpose of it is to see if we can come up with a strategy that would avoid the use of pesticides in wheat crops, as they kill other creatures like bumblebees.’

A Rothamsted Research spokesman said it was pleased that the protest was peaceful, and that ‘both supporters and opponents had the chance to make their voices heard’.
