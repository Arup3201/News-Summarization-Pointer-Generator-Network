It wouldn't be a Golden Globe nomination ceremony without more than a few British actors and actresses getting a mention and this year the ladies are flying the Union flag.

On Thursday morning it was announced that Felicity Jones and Rosamund Pike will be vying against each other in the Best Actress - Drama for their stand out roles in The Theory Of Everything and Gone Girl.

And in the same category, but for Comedy or Musical, Dame Helen Mirren and Emily Blunt will be hoping to take home a gold status for their parts in The Hundred Foot Journey and Into The Woods.

Doing it for the Brits: Felicity Jones' emotional turn in The Theory Of Everything has been recognised in the Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama)

Funny girl: Emily Blunt has been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the musical Into The Woods

Another nod: This is Dame Helen Mirren's tenth Golden Globe nomination, this time for her leading role in The Hundred Foot Journey

It's first time Golden Globe nominations for Jones and Pike, in very opposing roles.

Felicity plays Jane Hawking, the first wife of the famous English theoretical physicist, and the woman that loved, cared and supported him for much of his miraculous life.

'I'm overjoyed to hear this news! It's a tremendous feeling to receive recognition for this film amongst a list of so many wonderful actors - an absolute privilege. The greatest thanks to the HFPA, and to Jane Hawking for entrusting me with performing her moving and inspirational life story,' Jones said after learning of her nomination. 

As Amy Elliot-Dunne, Rosamund isn't quite so loving to her husband in the sinister film that unravels the mystery behind her potential murder. Gillian Flynn has also been nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay for bringing her best-selling book to the big screen.

Keira Knightley has been nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her turn as Joan Clarke in The Imitation Game, a film which received five nominations in total.

Daring: Rosamund Pike's thrilling performance in Gone Girl has also been recognised in the same category

Five times a charm: Keira Knightley is nominated for Best Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama) for her role in The Imitation Game and Benedict Cumberbatch for Best Actor. The film has a total of five nominations

First time club: Eddie Redmayne's critically lauded performance as Stephen Hawking has earned him his first nomination

One of them, of course, went to Benedict Cumberbatch whose turn as mathematical prodigy Alan Turing has been critically lauded since the film's release.

Written by Graham Moore (also nominated) the period drama follows the work of Turing and a team of mathematicians during WWII as they try to crack the Nazi's Enigma code. 

He'll be up against Eddie Redmayne, whose transformative performance as Stephen Hawking was celebrated by the physics genius himself, and fellow Brit David Oyelowo who plays Martin Luther King Jr. in civil rights drama Selma.

Big role: David Oyelowo competes against Eddie and Benedict for Best Actor for his role as Martin Luther King Jr. in civil rights drama Selma

Brits do it better! Dominic West and Ruth Wilson have got nods for their roles in TV series The Affair

Up again: Former host Ricky Gervais is nominated for his leading role in Derek

Oyelowo reunites with his The Butler co-star Oprah Winfrey in the film that looks back at the famous march from  Selma to Montgomery by King and his followers, which culminated in President Lyndon Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Ralph Fiennes' hilarious performance as M. Gustave in Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel earned him a Golden Globe nod in the Best Actor - Comedy or Musical category.

In the television categories Ruth Wilson and Dominic West have been nominated for their new roles in Showtime drama The Affair, for Best Actress and Actor - Drama.

Stand out: It's no surprise Ralph Fiennes received a nominated for his hilarious turn in The Grand Budapest Hotel

Back again: Martin Freeman has a nod for his role in TV series Fargo

The Good Wife: Alan Cumming gets a nomination for his supporting role as Eli Gold

Up again: Joanne Frogatt receives a nomination for her role in Downton Abbey

Ricky Gervais has been given the nod for his role as Derek in the dramedy series of the same name in the Best Actor - Comedy or Musical.

The Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television sees Martin Freeman nominated for his role in Fargo.

Downton Abbey's Joanne Frogatt is up for a gong in the Best Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or MFT Movie category for her continued role as Mrs. Anna Bates.

Clive Owen was nominated for his new role in HBO period drama The Knick. 

And Alan Cumming has landed a nod in the male version of the category with his role as Eli Gold in The Good Wife.

A surprising addition to the Best Picture category was the indie comedy Pride starring Andrew Scott, Imelda Staunton and Dominic West.

The film follows a group of U.K. gay activists who work to help miners during their lengthy strike of the National Union of Mineworkers in the summer of 1984.

The nominations were revealed by actress Kate Beckinsale in Beverly Hills on Thursday ahead of the 72nd annual Golden Globe Awards alongside Paula Patton, Peter Krause, Jeremy Piven and this year's Miss Golden Globe Greer Grammer.

The ceremony will be presented on January 11, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. 

Golden girl! Kate Beckinsale took the honor of announcing the nominees in Beverly Hills on Thursday
