A deputy prosecutor in Washington state allegedly exchanged more than a thousand text messages, including a photograph of herself in a bikini, with a convicted robber and girlfriend-beater who has 'criminal' tattooed on his forehead.

Marriya Wright, who works for Spokane County, is accused of rendering criminal assistance to Matthew Baumrucker, an inmate in the Spokane County Jail.

Court documents unsealed last week reveal the pair corresponded via text or phone calls 1,280 times between February 6 and March 5, and she visited him several times in jail, according to a statement from a Spokane County corrections officer.

Their visits occurred in the attorney-client booth, despite the fact Wright was not assigned to any of Baumrucker's cases.

That same officer told police Baumrucker had a picture of Wright in a swimsuit in his cell phone, adding that he had 'never seen an inmate in possession of a prosecuting attorneys photograph in a bikini.'

Baumrucker has multiple felony convictions and has served prison sentences for robbery, assault and domestic violence.

At the time police began their investigation, he was facing drug and assault charges.

Wright has not yet been charged, but she has been suspended as police investigate the pair's relationship, which authorities discovered while investigating Baumrucker in an assault.

According to KXLY.com, police were trying to find Baumrucker in connection with those charges back in March.

A woman who was in an apartment with Baumrucker at the time later told police he called Wright and said, 'Marriya, the police are chasing me, I am in an apartment.'

She said he then relayed a message that she didn't have to let the police in to search if they did not have a search warrant, so they didn't answer the door.

Another witness told investigators Baumrucker met Wright in a car at a nearby gas station, an account corroborated by surveillance video obtained by police.

Court records seen by KXLY.com show state charges against Baumrucker were dropped on August 15, but federal prosecutors filed charges against him one day before for being a felon in possession of a firearm, a Hi-Point C9 semi-automatic pistol.

A judge ordered that he remain in jail until the disposition of his trial in October. In the meantime, Wright is on leave from the prosecutor's office while the investigation continues.
