A mother-of-three who was admitted to hospital with earache died five days later from meningitis.

Jo Graham thought she had a harmless infection when she was admitted to hospital after complaining of an intense earache.

But the 36-year-old failed to respond to treatment and was put in an induced coma at Coventry University Hospital last December.

Jo Graham, 36, was admitted to Coventry University Hospital suffering from severe earache. She was told she could probably go home the next day but her condition deteriorated rapidly

Her husband Mark made the agonising decision to turn off her life support machine five days later when doctors said nothing more could be done to save her.

The cause of death was only picked up in a post-mortem examination as hospital tests failed to reveal that she had meningitis.

Mrs Graham was at a Christmas lights switch on in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, with her father, Roy, when she started to feel unwell.

Her mother, Pat Collins, who was in hospital with pneumonia at the time, said: ‘She told Roy she wasn’t feeling very well and Roy took her to hospital in Coventry.

The mother-of-three failed to respond to treatment and was put in an induced coma. Five days after she was admitted, doctors advised her family to turn off her life support machine

‘Jo was given tablets and was told 
she could probably go home the following day but she wasn't getting any 
better and she stayed in hospital.’

Ms
Collins was unaware of her daughter's battle for life until a relative 
came to deliver the devastating news that she wasn't 'expected to last 
another day.'

She was discharged so she could visit her daughter, who worked for Warwickshire Police, and was with her the day her life support machine was switched off.

Her family, including her three children - Jade, 12, Callum, eight, and Kayla four, have spoken out to raise awareness of meningitis.

A post mortem examination revealed that she had died of meningitis which did not show up on the tests carried out at Coventry University Hospital

Ms Collins paid tribute to her daughter and said: ‘Jo was bubbly, her children were her life and she loved her job, all that's been taken from her.

‘Part of us still can't believe that she's gone. We still keep expecting her to walk through the door.’

Mrs Graham's kidneys, liver, pancreas and lungs were donated after her death and her family have been told that has helped save the lives of four people.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

About 3,400 people contract bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in the UK each year - one in 10 people die while one in four are left with permanent disabilities.

Meningitis is an infection of the meninges - the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

The infection causes the meninges to become inflamed and can damage the nerves and brain.

The most common symptoms include a high fever, severe headache, vomiting, a stiff neck, sensitivity to light, rapid breathing and a rash which does not disappear under pressure.

There are two different types of meningitis - bacterial meningitis which is very serious and should be treated as a medical emergency, and viral meningitis which is more common and less serious.

Meningitis can be hard to diagnose as it can come on very suddenly and is often mistaken for flu.

Viral meningitis usually gets better within a couple of weeks but bacterial meningitis requires hospital admission for treatment with antibiotics.
