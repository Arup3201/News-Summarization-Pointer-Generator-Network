Gabrielle Giffords looked visibly recovered as she listened to President Obama’s State of the Union address yesterday - just two years after she was shot in the head at point blank range.

The former Congresswoman, who retired in 2012, was singled out during a powerful plea from President Barack Obama for stronger gun control laws.

Giffords attended the address with her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly.

They were both guests of fellow Arizonans Senator John McCain and Representative Ron Barber.

Barber was also injured in the 2011 Tucson shooting, in which six people were killed.

Her appearance came a day after her PAC Americans for Responsible Solutions, which she founded with husband Kelly, released its first advert urging Congress to support tight gun laws.

In it she narrates over images of recent gun massacres: 'We have a problem, where we shop, where we pray, where our children go to school.

'But there are solutions we can agree on, even gun owners like us. Take it from me, Congress must act. Let’s get this done.’

Giffords was named in a list of gun crime victims by President Obama, who he said deserved the introduction of tighter controls.

The Sandy Hook massacre was also 
mentioned as was majorette Hadiya Pendleton, who was shot dead three 
weeks after performing at the President’s inauguration.

President Obama said: ‘Hadiya’s 
parents Nate and Cleo are in the chamber tonight, along with more than 
two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.

‘They deserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote.’

The former Congresswoman, pictured at hospital in May 2011, continues to make a remarkable recovery from her injuries after being shot at point blank range by gunman Jared Lee Loughner

Giffords and her husband both wore green ribbons in memory of the Sandy Hook victims.

It was her first major public appeared since she made a passionate speech to a Senate Judiciary Committee last month.

The Arizona Democrat spoke in short and composed but occasionally stilted sentences.

She said: ‘Speaking is difficult but I need to say something. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying.

‘We must do something. It will be hard but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous. Americans are counting on you.’

Giffords has made a remarkable recovery since being critically injured by gunman Jared Lee Loughner.

She was shot during the Congress On Your Corner gathering outside a Safeway store in Casas Adobes, Arizona.

Giffords was given emergency first aid by her intern Daniel Hernandez Jr, who is credited with saving her life, before being taken to hospital. 

She has regained her speech and can write with her left hand and can walk but does not have the use of her right arm and is partially blind.
