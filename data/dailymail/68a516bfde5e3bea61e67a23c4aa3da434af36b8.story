Farmers are producing ‘designer tomatoes’ in a revolutionary greenhouse that can change the flavour and add vitamin C by growing them under pink LED lights.

Farm technologists have discovered that changing the colour of the lights, from red to a fuchsia pink or blue, will alter the flavour, delivering a more home-grown taste.

The new technology also means tomatoes can be grown all year round under glass, preventing the need for imports from warmer climates, such as Spain.

Currently, 80 per cent of the tomatoes eaten in the UK are imported, which generates huge transport costs and waste.

Farmers in this country have traditionally used sodium lights, which give off a white or yellow colour, in their greenhouses to extend the growing season for summer crops.

However, it appears the LEDs – Light Emitting Diodes – are much more effective in mimicking the sun and they can deliver different colours of light, which can intensify the flavour.

The LEDs also use much less energy, which means growing tomatoes and other crops in greenhouses under light through the winter becomes financially viable.

Experts at the Stockbridge Technology Centre in Selby, north Yorkshire, are already growing tomatoes under the brightly coloured LED lights at a new 1,000 square metre glasshouse.

Nigel Bartle, chairman of the British Tomato Growers’ Association, said the process of photosynthesis, which is the key part of the growth process, principally uses the red and blue spectrum found in sunlight.

‘The LED system means that we can target the colour of the light that the plant needs, rather than just giving a blanket white light,’ he said.

‘In doing that we use as incredibly reduced amount of energy. As a result, LEDs offer a great opportunity to grow something very efficiently.’

The trials also involve growing salad leaves, strawberries and garden plants under a mix of coloured LED lights.

The research in Yorkshire is looking at specialist, highly flavoured tomatoes, such as Sunstream, a midi-plum variety, rather than the cheap bulk buy imports that tend to be bland or watery.

Some of these were grown in the glasshouse through the autumn and harvested in December before going on sale in the area in the run-up to Christmas.

Mr Bartle said: ‘They have been very well received due to their exceptional, just-picked taste. Sunstream is a lovely variety, with a deep red colour, but most importantly, that home grown flavour.’

Graham Ward, the chief executive of the technology centre, said: ‘Basically the LED gives us the advantage that you can build up your own bespoke colours of light. That allows you to change the flavour and shelf life.’

The centre is researching how changing the light and colours affects the taste and the nutritional quality of the tomato.

There is some evidence from Holland that there are real benefits. A project between the LED manufacturer Philips and Wageningen University found that the system can produce healthier tomatoes.

Crops receiving extra light from the LEDs contained up to twice as much vitamin C as others, even though the extra dose was equivalent to only a quarter of the natural light intensity on a sunny day.

The Cornerways Nursery, based in Norfolk, which is one of the UK’s biggest tomato producers, is supporting the trial. Its general manager, Patrick Harte, said the LED system will allow the crop be grown all year round.

‘One of the large challenges around growing in the winter is the amount of capital involved, which can be £1m a hectare. The purpose of this trial for us to understand the technologies and see whether they deliver the returns we want,’ he said.

Mr Harte told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today programme that while people eat fewer tomatoes in the winter, there is still a large market.

‘We are importing a lot of tomatoes across the winter and having a high quality tomato that is fresh and local to market means we can get something that is better tasting for consumers,’ he said.
