Katie Hopkins  dislikes plus-size models and wants overweight people to pay the NHS to treat any health problems resulting from their size

Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people. 

But her latest battle - to shame people into losing weight - has virtually made her a social pariah. 

The television star's new documentary, which sees her gain and lose three stone in six months, has made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her. 

The mother-of-three told FEMAIL: 'Fat people can be quite afraid of me, there is this sort of Hopkins fear.

'A lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street. 

'Others will present me with their excuses before I have even opened my mouth, which is weird because it's not like I go around judging me all of the time. 

Fat mums completely avoid me, but that’s fine.' 

Katie has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years. 

Last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she wouldn't hire a fat person because they are 'lazy'. 

So in the last six months, the 39-year-old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly, to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds.

The star has very little time for larger people, admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat, but she has even less for their excuses.

Instead of laying the blame for Britain's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies, Katie says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do.

The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story follows Katie Hopkins as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise 

Katie said: 'At my heaviest during this television experiment, I weighed 12 stone. 

'Nowadays, I hear a lot of women say 12st isn’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14.

'But it's strange idea that we think 12st isn’t that big, I actually find it very alarming.

Katie wants her TLC documentary to start a debate about the nation's obesity crisis

'We keep pushing up the boundaries, first of all 10st wasn't that big, then 11st and now 12st.

'I really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation. 

'By putting size 16 models in Debenhams shop windows and embracing bigger seats, bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal.'

But while Katie thinks the plus-size models in Debenhams shop windows are unacceptable, the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in Topshop are acceptable in her eyes. 

She said: 'I don’t mind skinny mannequins.

'I didn’t think that they were particularly skinny, I thought that they pretty alright. 

'There are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny. I was a pretty skinny kid.

'In terms of sizing, Mango starts their plus-size collection at a size 12 and I’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat. 

'Because for me, it’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat, it’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal. 

'I believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger, we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal.' 

Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. 

Asked about a fat tax as a potential solution, making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce, Katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option.

The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st  'killed her' and left her in constant floods

In part two of Katie's documentary, airing Saturday, she debates diet bloggers and plus-size campaigners

She says: 'I’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax, but I would go much more brutal than that. 

'I think the fact that we don’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have.

'For instance, our NHS in this country is free at point of use, but most people perceive that as completely free. 

'Therefore, any problem that they create with their body is also free, with someone else footing the bill.'

She continued: 'Obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £17.4 billion last year.

'We need to make these people own the problem. So, we should have a social security insurance scheme, whereby people are charged if they don’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health.

'If you don’t look after your own health, guess what? You’re going to pay more. So if you smoke, guess what? You’re going to pay more. You drink too much, guess what? You’re going to pay more.

'And if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese, then you’re going to pay for your hip operation as well.

'That would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax.

'Because this tea and sympathy lark just isn't working.' 

The first episode of Katie's new two-part documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story airs tonight on TLC, with the second programme coming out tomorrow evening. 

In half a year, Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit.

The journey was all captured on camera. 

Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, airs Friday and Saturday, 2 and 3 January at 9pm on TLC.
