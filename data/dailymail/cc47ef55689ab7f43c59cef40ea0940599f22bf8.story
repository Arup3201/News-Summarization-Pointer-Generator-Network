It is recognised the world over as a symbol of Britain's unity.

But the design of the Union flag could be changed forever if Scotland wins its independence.

The iconic red, white and blue design incorporates the crosses of the patron saints of England, Scotland and Ireland.

But without the striking blue of Scotland's St Andrew's saltire, just the red cross of St George and the diagonal red cross of St Patrick, which represents Ireland, would remain.

The patron saint of Wales, St David, is not represented in the Union flag as it is integrated into the constitutional body of England and Wales. 

The flag has been virtually unchanged for 400 years and is one of the more visual impacts the Scots and Britain would have to confront if the radical division went ahead. 

New design: This is what the Union flag would look like without the striking blue representing Scotland if it won its independence

National symbol: The Union flag is one of the best known flags in the world. It has been around for about 400 years and very little has changed in its design

Today, Education Secretary Michael Gove, the highest profile Scottish member of the UK Cabinet, accused SNP leader Alex Salmond of 'avoiding and dodging some fundamental questions' over the controversial issue.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'Do the people of Scotland want to have the pound, the euro or an alternative currency?

'Do the people of Scotland want to have the same level of welfare benefits as the rest of the United Kingdom?

'Do they want to be part of the same nation that has a British Broadcasting Corporation and a National Health Service?

'Do they want the Royal Navy and British Army to remain institutions that embody patriotic feeling and sentiment, or do they want to sunder and separate them?'

He urged the Scottish Government to accept a 'decisive yes or no question' for the ballot.

Today Mr Salmond offered to host 
talks with Prime Minister David Cameron and Nick Clegg 'in Edinburgh, in London or wherever' on 
the next steps in the staging of a referendum.

Mr Salmond's offer came as he met Deputy 
Prime Minister Nick Clegg for a summit of the British-Irish Council in 
Dublin, just hours after he accused the UK Government of 'bullying' the 
people of Scotland over independence.

Mr Clegg rejected the accusation of 
bullying and said he and Mr Cameron had made it clear that they want 
direct talks with the Scottish Government on the referendum.

Mr Salmond appeared alongside Mr 
Clegg at a press conference in Dublin at the conclusion of the 
summit, which brings together representatives of 
national and devolved governments from across the British Isles.

The First Minister announced that he will
publish his proposals for an independence referendum in the autumn of 
2014 on January 25 and will be happy to meet Mr Cameron after that.

Should the Scots be allowed to keep the pound if they become independent?

In
an interview broadcast shortly before the meeting, the First Minister 
warned that he would not be pushed around by Westminster: 'Bullying and 
hectoring the Scottish people from London ain't gonna work.

'What we're seeing is the most extraordinary attempt to bully and intimidate Scotland by Westminster politicians.'

Asked about his comments, Mr Salmond 
said: 'On the subject of Scotland's constitutional future, the UK 
Government made proposals last Tuesday, the Scottish Government will be 
launching our consultation document a week on Wednesday - a consultation
document with the whole community of Scotland.

'We believe, we know,
and I think it's generally acknowledged that we have got an 
unanswerable political mandate - that is an absolute majority in a 
proportional parliamentary system - to conduct a referendum on 
Scotland's constitutional future.

'What I have said to the Deputy 
Prime Minister, which I think is similar to what the Prime Minister said
in the House of Commons, is that, once we've published the Scottish 
Government's consultation document, I am very happy to meet the Prime 
Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister in Edinburgh, in London or 
wherever to talk through these things in a positive way.

The 'Union Jack' was first introduced under the proclamation of King James 1 in 1606 and was known as 'the British flag'.

It was ordered to be flown at the masthead of all ships and warships of Scotland and England.

The word 'Jack' was used to describe the maritime bow flag but by 1627 a small Union Jack was flown in this position.

Some say it was known as the 'Jack Flag' or 'The Jack' for several years but by 1674 it was commonly called the Union Jack.

Recently there has been some debate over whether the flag should be called the Union flag - unless it is flown from a warship and then it can be called the Union Jack.

But according to the Flag Institute either is fine. It states: 'the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack

'Far better,
whatever our views on events of recent days, that we can come to a 
constructive dialogue. I think that's what the people would expect and I
think that can take us forward.

'Once we publish our proposals, 
perhaps some of the fears that people have will dissolve in the light of
these proposals being published.'

Mr Salmond wants to put the 
referendum question - or questions - to the test  in a 
ballot overseen by a Scottish body and open to voters as young as 16.

Mr Cameron offered Holyrood the temporary power to hold a 'legal' referendum overseen by the Electoral Commission amid suggestions earlier this week that it would have to be held within 18 months.

Yesterday, George Osborne twice refused to say whether the Scots would be able to keep sterling if they opt to break up the union.

And the Chancellor warned that a move to back Mr Salmond’s bid for independence would seriously damage the Scottish economy.

Mr
Osborne told ITV News: ‘Alex Salmond has said he’d want Scotland to 
join the euro and you have to ask yourself is that the currency you want
to be joining at the moment?’

Asked whether the British government would let Scotland keep the pound, Mr Osborne said: ‘All these issues are going to be fleshed out now and flushed out.’

He added: ‘The SNP is going to have to explain what its plans are for the currency of Scotland, what its plans are for the defence of Scotland when it doesn’t have the protection of the UK, what its plans are for the Scottish economy when it’s not part of a larger economy.’

The Government in London has said that only it can sanction a legally binding referendum, which the SNP is planning for 2014.

Warning: Chancellor George Osborne told Scotland it could be forced to give up the pound if it became independent of the rest of the UK. He is pictured earlier this week during a visit to the Macclesfield AstraZeneca site in Cheshire

If Scotland goes it alone, Mr Salmond would have to apply for membership of the EU and would be expected to join the euro.

Mr
Salmond claims Scotland would walk away with 90 per cent of North Sea 
oil assets, but leave English taxpayers to shoulder the £187billion 
exposure to the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Mr
Salmond said the people responsible for the meltdown at RBS ‘were the 
London Treasury’, adding: ‘I’m afraid people will have to take 
responsibility for the past mistakes they made.’

Labour former Chancellor Alistair Darling said Salmond publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so disastrous

But
it later emerged he wrote a letter to disgraced former RBS boss Sir 
Fred Goodwin offering him ‘any assistance my office can provide’ in the 
purchase of ABN Ambro, the deal that wrecked the bank’s finances.

Former
Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling joined the charge against Scotland’s
First Minister: ‘It is typical of his bluster. He cannot overlook the 
fact that he publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so 
disastrous.

‘The disaster that overtook the bank was made in Edinburgh, not London.’

Mr Osborne warned that uncertainty over independence is already damaging the Scottish economy.

He said: ‘There are businesses that are nervous about investing in Scotland when they don’t know about its constitutional future.’

The tensions over the referendum issue even spilled over into whether the Scots would be able to keep the two giant pandas loaned by China to Edinburgh Zoo.

The Chinese have made it clear that the bears are ‘a gift to the people of the UK’.

If Scotland becomes independent, some say Tian Tian and Yang Guang might have to leave the country.
