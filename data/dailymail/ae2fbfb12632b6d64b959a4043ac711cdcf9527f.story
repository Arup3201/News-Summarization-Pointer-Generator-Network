Two men in their mid-twenties and best friends since childhood died together on Saturday night after their boat capsized in rough conditions on the Great Salt Lake in Utah.

The bodies of Logan Hardman, 25, of West Jordan and Chad Tohinaka, 25, of Sandy were pulled from the dark waters of the lake just before midnight on Saturday.

Tohinaka was a student at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, while Hardman was a devoted family man who leaves behind a wife, Tasha, a three-year-old daughter Brynnlee and one-year-old son Brody.

The two men, along with a 24-year-old friend, were heading back to shore from one of their regular duck hunting trips at about 4 p.m. on Saturday when the weather suddenly changed.

Within seconds, waves flooded their boat, causing it to capsize and plunging all three men into the freezing 47-degree water.

The 24-year-old man, whose name has not been released, swam about a half-mile to shore for help. Both Hardman and Tohinaka stayed with the boat, a 12 foot flat-bottomed vessel that the three men had recently purchased. The bodies were located approximately six miles east of the Great Salt Lake State Marina, where they had set sail from earlier that day.

The Great Salt Lake is notorious for unpredictable conditions and on Saturday it experienced mild squall conditions, where periods of high wind would pass creating choppy two- to three-foot waves.

Hardman and Tohinaka forged a lifetime’s friendship while still in diapers.

Hardman’s mother acted as babysitter for the boys at her home in Kearns, where Tohinaka’s mother was a local school teacher who taught Hardman’s three older brothers.

‘It was a wonderful friendship and, you 
know, it was nice that they were not alone at the end,’ Tohinaka’s 
mother, Karen Tohinaka, told The Salt Lake Tribune.

Although they never lived in the same city, or attended the same schools the boys remained the best of friends throughout their lives. 

'Logan and Chad have been inseparable since three year's old,' Matt Hardman, a brother of Logan, told Deseret News. 'They grew up that way and kept doing everything out of Jr. high and high school.'

When Hardman married, Tohinaka was his best man.

Tasha Hardman wrote on Tohinaka's Facebook page: 'Not only did I loose my husband and my kids lost their father but we also lost you a brother, great friend and my kids lost their uncle.

'Thank you for keeping my sweetheart company, it gives me comfort to know that you guys were together and not alone. You will truly be missed, we miss and love you very much. You were an amazing person!'

Hardman was described by his family as a calm and quiet person with an infectious smile, a passionate husband and father of two, a deeply religious man and an avid duck hunter.

Tragically, his life insurance policy was not scheduled to start until the new year. To assist his wife and children, an account has been established in Logan Hardman's name and individuals interested in donating can do so through Zion's Bank.
