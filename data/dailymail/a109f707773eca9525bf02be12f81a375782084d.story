Peter Clarke's first goal of the season boosted Blackpool's hopes of avoiding relegation from the Sky Bet Championship with a 1-0 win over fellow strugglers Millwall.

The Seasiders had only won one of their previous 14 games in all competitions and earlier in the week owner Owen Oyston wrote an open letter to disgruntled Blackpool supporters.

But Clarke's first-half header moved the bottom side to within eight points of safety, while Millwall remained inside the bottom three with this their fourth league game without a win.

Chris Hughton's first Championship fixture in charge of Brighton was decided 1-0 in his side's favour after Rohan Ince netted the only goal of the game.

The midfielder's header ended up shading a low-key encounter at the Valley against a Charlton side that lacked a cutting edge.

Hughton, sacked by Norwich at the tail end of last season, was hired to replace Sami Hyypia following the former Liverpool defender's pre-Christmas resignation.

He tasted victory at the first attempt as Albion won 2-0 at Brentford in the FA Cup last week and has now seen his side move further away from the relegation places.

Malky Mackay's Wigan woes continued as Clayton Donaldson's hat-trick fired Birmingham to a comfortable win at St Andrew's.

The Latics have now won only one of eight league games under the Scot's guidance and looked set for their sixth league defeat in that spell right from the first minute.

Donaldson headed in after 67 seconds and made it 2-0 with a tap-in 13 minutes later. James McClean's superb curling effort reduced the deficit before the break, but the Blues striker's third just after the hour put the game beyond the Lancashire side.

Huddersfield centre back Joel Lynch produced a stunning striker's finish as the Terriers shocked high-flying Watford with a 3-1 win at the John Smith's Stadium.

Watford had won four of their last five Sky Bet Championship games but Huddersfield romped home with an impressive second half display.

Lynch, celebrating his 200th career league appearance after missing six games through injury, got the third goal with a brilliant overhead kick.

After a goalless first half, Nahki Wells put Huddersfield ahead before sub Odion Ighalo equalised with virtually his first touch. James Vaughan made it 2-1 before Lynch's late acrobatics sealed victory. 

Brentford ended their three game losing streak to win 1-0 and inflict a first league defeat in seven on draw specialists Rotherham.

A text book Stuart Dallas volley just before the hour clinched the points and ended the Millers' dogged resistance. 

Middlesbrough's promotion push suffered a slight setback when they were held to an uninspiring 0-0 by lowly Reading at the Madejski Stadium.

Neither side impressed in a drab first half but both upped the tempo in an improved spectacle in the second period.

Reading threatened briefly but were indebted to goalkeeper Adam Federici, who made two superb saves from Patrick Bamford and Kike near the end to force the draw.

Sheffield Wednesday triumphed 2-0 to claim their first win at the City Ground since 2001 and pile yet more pressure on beleaguered Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce.

Owls boss Stuart Gray is close friends with Pearce and his assistant Steve Wigley, but he did them no favours as goals from Kieran Lee and Chris Maguire, either side of half time, earned the visitors a simple win. 

In the other major matches of the round Ipswich fell 1-0 to Derby, Norwich beat leaders Bournemouth 2-1 away, Cardiff clinched a 1-0 win over Fulham while Bolton and Leeds were deadlocked at 1 - 1.
