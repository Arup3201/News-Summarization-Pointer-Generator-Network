A toddler who had 70 per cent of her kidneys removed in her  battle with cancer has been given the all-clear.

Rumeysa Kose had 27 gruelling courses of chemotherapy after a cluster of malignant tumours was found in her kidneys in April.

Her father Osman, 33, had noticed lumps on the 16-month-old’s abdomen and took her to the doctors, who immediately admitted her to hospital to begin treatment.

However, tests soon showed that the chemotherapy wasn’t getting rid of the cancer and doctors told Mr Kose that the affected organ ‘looked more like a tumour with a kidney on it than a kidney with a tumour’.

In June, surgeons removed Rumeysa’s entire right kidney and a third of her left during a five-hour operation at Birmingham’s Children Hospital.

After the operation the youngster was moved to University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

And yesterday Rumeysa was finally allowed back home to Clayton, Staffordshire, where she can play with her four-year-old brother Huseyin.

Her mother Esra, 31, said: ‘Because she was so young when she was diagnosed, as her mother, you often wish it was yourself who was ill. We’ve been told by the doctor that the cancer can come back, but hopefully it won’t.’

Mr Kose, a computing student, added: ‘If we hadn’t found the lump  on her tummy when she was having  a bath, I dread to think what would have happened.’

After her operation, the toddler, was moved to University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Just before Christmas she was visited by ex-England footballer Michael Owen who posed for pictures with her and promised to keep in touch with the family.

He was touched by Rumeysa's plight as he handed out Christmas presents to youngsters at the children's centre at the hospital with other Stoke City players.

Today her thrilled parents, Osman, 33, and Esra, 31, thanked the 33-year-old goal scorer for his support, saying they gave them a 'real lift'.

Rumeysa has had to endure 27 rounds of debilitating chemotherapy that have left her unable to walk

He said: 'When the doctor told us what was wrong with Rumeysa I went into shock.

'The consultant spent five or 10 minutes trying to explain what was wrong with her to me and my wife, but I just couldn't hear what he was saying.

'I could see his mouth moving but there was no sound, I was just in shock.

'You would not have known there was anything wrong with Rumeysa, she was a happy smiley child, always laughing.

'If we hadn't found the lump on her tummy when she was having a bath I dread to think what would have happened.

'The treatment has left her so very weak, it is a strong chemotherapy leaving her legs weakened, she should have learnt to walk by now, but it is a huge effort for her just to crawl.

'When they did some tests they found the tumour was huge and the chemo wasn't getting rid of it all.

'They told me it looked more like a tumour with a kidney on it than a kidney with a tumour.

'So they had to go in and remove one kidney and a third of the other.

'The visit in hospital from Michael Owen was brilliant.

'You could see that everyone at the hospital got a lift from it.

After 27 courses of chemotherapy, Rumeysa has been given the all clear

'We had been through some real dark times, very bad, but talking to him and seeing him take an interest gave us such an emotional lift.

'He was absolutely lovely and though Rumeysa didn't know who he was the effect it had on the rest of us really helped her.

'Now she is still going to have a few more sessions of chemotherapy and may need a kidney transplant one day, but right now she is clear and that is wonderful.

'I just want to thank everyone who took an interest in my little girl, it was so heartwarming and helped us so much.'

Speaking from training yesterday, kind-hearted Owen said: 'It is great news to hear that Rumeysa is well again, especially at this time of year.

'I loved visiting the children at the hospital and this news just tops it off perfectly.'
