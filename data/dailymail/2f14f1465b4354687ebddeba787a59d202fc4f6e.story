Turkey is demanding the return of a slab stone, which has been at the British Museum since 1927.

In January, the Turkish Government wrote to the museum to request that the grey carved stone object, known as the Samsat Stele, be removed from their collection and transferred to back to its homeland.

The basalt stone from the 1st century BC, measures 1.3m high (4.3ft), and is currently on display in Room 52 of the museum.

Dispute: The basalt stone from the 1st century BC, measures 1.3m high (4.3ft). In January, the Turkish Government wrote to the museum to request that the grey carved stone slab, known as the Samsat Stele be returned

The Elgin Marbles refer to a collection of stone objects depicting gods, men and monsters - were removed from Athens' Parthenon in 1811 by Lord Elgin. He was the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire that controlled Greece at the time.

The objects were then purchased by the British Parliament from Lord Elgin in 1816 and presented by Parliament to the British Museum, where they have been resided since.

The subject of their return to Greece has become both a political and national issue, with the Greeks demanding they be sent back to their country of origin, while London's British Museum has insisted they stay in England.

It does not attract as many visitors as the museum's glamorous Elgin Marbles, which famously Greece demanded be returned, but is now at the centre of a dispute as both sides lay down their reasons for claiming rightful ownership.

Found in southern Turkey in 1882, it has been in Britain for decades, after Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, the museum's director of excavations, purchased it in 1927.

The slab, has an image of ancient King Antiochus carved out, greeting Herakles.

It has a large hole drilled through the middle because it has been used as a olive press in the past.

Turkey's letter in January is not a one-off, they have recently demanded the return of several pieces worldwide in recent years.

Targets included on their campaign to restore art to the country include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the J.Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Louvre in Paris and the State Museums of Berlin.

Although many of the claims were put 
in years ago, Osman Murat Suslu, the new director of cultural heritage 
and museums has stepped them up since he was appointed in 2010.

Turkey has started to refuse loan request from museums that posses the disputed objects. 

The
British Museum had asked for 35 items for the exhibition Hajj: Journey 
to the Heart of Islam  but although Turkish museums were agreeable to 
the loans, the ministry of culture blocked them, leaving the British 
Museum to find alternative objects at short notice.

The
V&A is facing a similar problem over its planned exhibition, The 
Ottomans, which needs loans  from Turkey -  scheduled for 2014, then delayed a 
year, it is now on hold.

Claim: Found in southern Turkey in 1882, the slab was purchases in 1927, by Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, the museum's director of excavations

The British Museum have considered 
the request for the past few months, but last week its director Neil 
MacGregor, replied to Turkey.

'At
no point between 1927 and 2005 have the Turkish authorities, who were 
fully aware of the stele's location, suggested that it has been 
improperly acquired or should be returned,' stated the museum.

Although
a claim was made for the stele in 2005, it was not pursued by the 
Turkish authorities and loans between the two countries continued.

In a statement the museum was keen to stress it wanted relations between the two countries to remain civil.

'The Museum greatly values the 
cordial relationship it has enjoyed with Turkish colleagues over recent 
years which has led to fruitful collaborations.' 

As
a compromise the museum did offer to lend the disputed artifact to 
Turkey if the country recognises the British Museum's ownership - there 
was a similar offer with the Elgin Marbles.

But it also made clear that it was not willing to return the object on a permanent basis:

'The Trustees of the British Museum 
cannot consent to the transfer of ownership of the stele and firmly 
believe that it should remain part of the British Museum’s collection 
where it can be seen in a world context by a global audience.'

Refusal: The British Museum will not return the Samsat Stele but have said they are willing to temporarily loan it to Turkey
