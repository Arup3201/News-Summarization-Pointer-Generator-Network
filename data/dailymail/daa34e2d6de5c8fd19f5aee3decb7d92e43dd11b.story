This archaeological dig less than a mile from Stonehenge has found early Brits feasted on frog's legs 8,000 years BEFORE the French

They might seem the epitome of French cuisine, but the English were feasting on frogs' legs up to 8,000 years before the French acquired a taste for them, archaeologists have claimed.

A charred toad's leg has been discovered alongside fish bones at a site just one mile away from Stonehenge in Wiltshire and is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world, scientists said.

The leg dates to between 6,250BC and 7,596BC - some 5,000 years before the prehistoric monument was built - and eaten 8,000 years earlier than the French and Czechs were documented as enjoying the delicacy, which they claimed as a national dish.

Archaeologists unearthed the leg alongside small fish vertebrate bones of trout or salmon as well as burnt aurochs' bones (the predecessors of cows) at the Blick Mead dig site near Amesbury.

David Jacques, senior research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, said: 'It would appear that thousands of years ago people were eating a Heston Blumenthal-style menu on this site, one-and-a-quarter miles from Stonehenge, consisting of toads' legs, aurochs, wild boar and red deer with hazelnuts for main, another course of salmon and trout and finishing off with blackberries.

'This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?'

The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum, who examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the mesolithic era.

Mr Jacques said that he hoped the discoveries would help confirm Amesbury as the oldest continuous settlement in the UK.

The site includes one of the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north-western Europe.

Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said that the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created.

He said: 'No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area.

'There
must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, 
with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, 
may well be it.

'I 
believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and 
weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most 
significant mesolithic home base ever found in Britain.

Currently
Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest 
continuous settlement in the UK, with Amesbury 104 years younger.

'By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered,' he added.
