Today West Midlands Police released CCTV images of the yob fleeing the Spon Gate pub in Coventry moments after the attack.

Mr Barrett, a builder from Coventry, said: 'It was like being in a horror movie.

'I was with my mates on the dance floor and suddenly I was in a head lock.

'When
 I tried to get myself free I felt a sharp pain on the side of my head 
and realised this bloke was actually trying to bite my ear off.

'I was screaming in pain and blood was everywhere and the bouncers came and he ran off.

'It
 was horrific. I have no idea why I was targeted, I was having a good 
night with my mates and I was attacked from nowhere for no reason.'

Mr Barrett, a builder, was rushed to hospital where doctors glued his ear and treated him for concussion
