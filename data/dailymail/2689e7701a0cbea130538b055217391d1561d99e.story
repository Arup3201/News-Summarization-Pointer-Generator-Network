A skydiver has captured the terrifying moment his parachute failed and sent him into a violent spin as he plummeted towards the ground.

The 27-year-old Canadian was jumping from 14,000ft when the lines on his parachute became entangled above Wilton, south west of Sydney.

The quick-thinking skydiver was only able to save himself by 'cutting away' and deploying his reserve chute - just seconds before impact.

A 27-year-old skydiver has captured the terrifying moment his parachute failed and sent him into a violent spin as he plummeted towards the ground near Sydney

The skydiver, who has jumped nearly 2,000 times before, said everything was running smoothly until he deployed the chute, which had been connected incorrectly, at about 3,000ft

'Under normal circumstances it's not very difficult to cut-away your main parachute. However, this was far from a normal situation. Someone else had hooked half my gear up incorrectly and I missed it,' the Canadian, who did not want wish to be named, said.

The skydiving instructor was jumping from a Sydney Skydivers plane during a routine jump in January when the incident unfolded, but only released the footage this week.

'Have you ever seen the Shawshank Redemption? Remember the scene when Tim Robbins climbs through a sewage pipe and comes out clean on the other side and he raises up his arms into the rain. Surviving this felt something like that,' he said.

The skydiver, who has jumped nearly 2,000 times before, said everything was running smoothly until he deployed the Velocity 96 high-performance chute, which had been connected incorrectly, at about 3,000ft.

Footage of the jump shows him going into a heavy spin as he tried to untangle the lines.

He then made a snap decision to try and disconnect from the main parachute to deploy the reserve chute.

All modern parachutes are fitted with a three-ring release system that allows for a rapid cut-away in the case of an emergency.

'Everyone has jokingly been telling me for months that I was going to have a bad cutaway - so when it twisted up on me I thought “Now they're all going to laugh at me”,' he said.

'But I took my time, as you can see in the video, I worked out all the scenarios, and then fixed it before my time ran out.'

But despite the frightening ordeal, the daredevil dusted himself off to complete two more jumps and said he had only been 'moderately' afraid.

'I did two jumps directly after,' he said.

'Two other people who saw the video left for the day.'
