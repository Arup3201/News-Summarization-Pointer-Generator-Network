The 24-year-old was found guilty of manufacturing a firearm and conspiracy to blackmail at Manchester Crown Court 

A student who built a DIY gun from YouTube instructions that was then used to shoot a drug dealer has been jailed. 

Michael Sierotko put together the steel and metal weapon after following step-by-step instructions from a video posted on the website. 

The 24-year-old from Glossop, Derbyshire, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years after being found guilty of manufacturing a gun and conspiring to blackmail. 

Manchester Crown Court heard how Sierotko fell in with a gang of criminals after racking up debt following his studies. 

After researching how to construct the weapon on YouTube, it was used in the kidnapping and shooting of drug dealer Neil Hazelwood. 

The court heard three masked captors, who have not been identified, bundled the 35-year-old into the back of a car and took him to woodland in Holmfirth, Yorkshire.

There, the gun that had been made by Sierotko, was used to fire a shot into Hazelwood's chest. He spent six weeks in hospital following the incident in September last year. 

Sierotko was cleared of attempted murder and conspiracy to kidnap but found guilty of manufacturing a firearm and conspiracy to blackmail. 

Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton said: 'The offences arise out of events that relate to the world of drug dealing. The people involved were working at a level higher than that of the supply on the streets.

'The conversations always involved substantial sums of money and you became indebted in larger sums. 

'These were ruthless people who have no regard to anyone if it serves there purpose not to do so.' 

'Your role here was to ferry one of the men and collect money and that man Neil Hazelwood was the victim of the blackmail.

Michael Sierotko followed instructions given in a YouTube video (pictured) on how to build a DIY gun at home 

'The jury were satisfied that there was a conspiracy to blackmail and you played a part in it.'

'Your role here was to ferry one of the men and collect money and that man Neil Hazelwood was the victim of the blackmail. 

'The jury were satisfied that there was a conspiracy to blackmail and you played a part in it.'

'Piping similar to that used (in the manufactured firearm) was found in your home. You had a demonstration video on your phone and it explained how to make the firearm. 

'The gun you made had no lawful purpose. It must have been made to be used.' 

He added Sierotko was a 'clever' young man who had fallen with a group of criminals before constructing the weapon.  

'I have watched you giving evidence and you are a clever young man and your academic achievments support that view but I viewed you as interested substantially in yourself and what you wanted. 

'You are highly manipulative.

'You have conducted charity work for your community. You are from a highly respectable family of hardworking people for who your behaviour is unacceptable.'

After pleading guilty to a separate charge for owning a sawn-off handgun, the 24-year-old was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail. 

Parts of the man's handmade gun were discovered by police at his home in Derbyshire where he also kept a sawn-off shotgun 

It is not known who used the DIY gun to shoot Neil Hazelwood (right) in the woods in September last year

Defending Stephen meadowcroft QC said of his client: 'He's not a violent individual, he comes from a very decent family. 

'He is a man who perhaps did not appreciate the serious mess he was getting himself into - once he went off the rails he was trapped. 

'He did well at school and went to college, he has qualifications - in woodwork, tiling and joinery. He could've had a perfectly good life.'
