Prison: Khalid Missouri now works as a solicitor at Southampton Crown Court where he was sentenced for robbery in 1993

A man jailed for his part in an armed robbery is now working as a senior lawyer in the very court where he was sent down, sparking an extraordinary legal row.

The criminal-turned-solicitor was even asked by one of his robbery  co-defendants to act for him in a subsequent sex assault case.

Khalid Missouri, 42, was jailed for seven years for his role in a raid in which staff at a Post Office branch were threatened by masked thugs wielding a gun and a knife.

Mr Missouri, the getaway driver, waited outside in a car while two other gang members burst into the branch at Calmore near Southampton.

But despite his conviction for robbery in 1993, Missouri has been allowed to qualify as a solicitor after his release from prison – and now works in the same Southampton Crown Court where he was sentenced.

The lawyer insisted yesterday he had been completely open about his past with the Law Society, the solicitors’ professional body, before he qualified as a lawyer in 2005.

But The Mail on Sunday has learnt that his career change has sparked astonishment in legal circles.

Concerns were laid bare when one of Mr Missouri’s former co-defendants in the robbery, Fouad Benabbou, who wielded the knife, applied to have the lawyer help defend him on a sex assault charge.

Court records from 2011 – which  can only now be published – reveal that Southampton Crown Court’s senior judge, Derwin Hope, blocked Benabbou’s application for legal aid for the defence work because he  was ‘extremely concerned’ about the arrangement. The request was eventually allowed on appeal, but only after another judge appeared to make clear his surprise that the lawyer could represent his former co-defendant.

Mr Missouri last night said that one of his law firm’s colleagues – not himself – went on to act for Benabbou, who was jailed for four years last August after being convicted on two counts of sexual assault.

In a statement yesterday, Mr Missouri said: ‘With regard to my conviction some 20 years ago, I can only reiterate how deeply sorry and ashamed I still am for my actions. I was rightly punished and have since tried my utmost to make amends.

Surprise: News of Khalid Missouri's previous conviction was said to be the talk of the robing room at Southampton Crown Court, Hampshire

‘I disclosed my previous conviction to the Law Society well before my admission to the roll of solicitors. I have been a solicitor for some eight years and have an exemplary record of professional conduct.’

In a statement, the Law Society said that a criminal conviction was not a complete bar to practise in every instance. A spokesman added: ‘The Society would have looked closely at all the facts before allowing entry to the profession.’

But one fellow Southampton lawyer expressed his surprise at the situation, saying: ‘This is the talk of the robing room in the court.

‘There is surprise that someone with such a serious offence can be working as a solicitor-advocate in court – especially the same one he was sent down in.’
