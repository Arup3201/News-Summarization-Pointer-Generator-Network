Piles of soiled and unusable goods dumped as 'donations' for charities are doing more damage than good, with Australians urged to think before they 'give away' their junk.

Charities are set to lose millions of dollars this holiday season disposing of the worthless items people offload, as they create room for gifts and treats they receive over Christmas.

For years, Lifeline's Gold Coast business manager Jim Dale has been picking up the pieces and this year he's bracing himself for the worst.

He says Christmas time is when op shops receive the most donations of junk and this leaves him 'frustrated and disappointed' every year.

'We get a lot of broken, soiled and ripped items donated to us this time of year,' Mr Dale told Daily Mail Australia.

'They include clothing, mattresses, lawn mowers and once even had a transmission with oil in it.

'Majority of our donors are responsible but there's always that minority who leave us disappointed and frustrated.'

Mr Dale says the process of removing the items are costly.

'It's quite expensive and here in the Gold Coast (southeastern Queensland) we've actually had to buy a second tip truck to help with the load. They cost more than $100,000 so they're not cheap.'

In a recent incident, it took Mr Dale and other volunteers four hours to remove seven mattresses, three lounges, two dining tables and a dirty barbecue.

Most of them had to be sent to the tip.

NACRO Chief Executive Officer Kerryn Caulfield says 'Christmas is a hard time of year for many Australian families struggling with poverty, so donations of good quality goods are needed by the charities'

Unfortunately Ms Caulfield says Christmas time is 'heartbreaking for the volunteers who return after the break to be faced with sorting through piles of dirty, broken household rubbish dumped amongst the donations'

NACRO chief executive Kerryn Caulfield says this year Australian charity op shops are set to lose millions of dollars for cleaning up junk that's been left behind by householders.

'That money should be going to help others,' she said.

Ms Caulfield says Christmas time is 'heartbreaking for the volunteers who return after the break to be faced with sorting through piles of dirty, broken household rubbish dumped amongst the donations'.

'Christmas is a hard time of year for many Australian families struggling with poverty, so donations of good quality goods are needed by the charities to raise funds so they can deliver their services.

'But giving un-useable or broken goods to a charity bin or op shop is not a donation - it is dumping waste and the cost of disposal of this rubbish takes away funds needed for the charities' community programs.'

The National Association of Charitable Recycling Organisations is appealing to householders to make their donations of secondhand goods count this Christmas season:

· Ask yourself, would you give this item to a friend in need (ie it's clean, undamaged, good quality);

· Donate direct to the op shop during operating hours or call to arrange pick-up for larger items;

· Put rubbish and damaged items in your rubbish bin.
