There was no mistaking where Prince William gets his dance moves from as he last night launched into an embarrassing routine in front of a giggling Duchess Of Cambridge.

William entertained Kate and numerous onlookers by throwing a few shapes on a visit to Centrepoint’s Camberwell Foyer homeless centre in Camberwell, south-east London.

He was chatting with resident Vanessa Boateng, 18, when he asked her whether the uniform he wore to his wedding looked 'dapper'.

Just like his father: Prince William entertains the Duchess Of Cambridge and Vanessa Boateng, 18, by throwing a few shapes on a visit to Centrepoint's Camberwell Foyer homeless centre in south-east London yesterday

Giving his all: Prince Harry might have cringed at his older brother's urban dance moves

'Nooooo,' she replied, 'your swag looked on point' - which is street slang for pretty damn good.

William, 29, looked pleased as punch and started doing a hip-hop style 
dance, brushing the shoulders of his jumper twice on each side.

While it is likely his brother, Harry, would have cringed at his attempts, Kate and Vanessa both looked delighted.

The prince was so chuffed at the reaction that he called Vanessa over to do it again at a reception later.

He also let slip his and Kate's future plans when he discovered that his new friend was training to become a nursery nurse.

'He said he was going to make his children come and I could discipline them,' she revealed.

'He is fantastic, he is great, I love him... We are friends.'

William's enthusiastic dancing was 
reminiscent of his father Prince Charles's regular attempts to blend in 
with local traditions via some questionable moves.

In the groove: Prince Charles dances the samba with 20-year-old Nayara as he visits the Maguari Community's village in Brazil's Amazonian rainforest in 2009

Most famously, during his first visit
 to Brazil in 1978, Charles took to the dance floor with a Samba dancer 
during a party staged by the mayor of Rio De Janeiro.

And as recently as 2009, Charles was twirling with a scantily-clad village girl in the centre of the Amazon rainforest.

William was already familiar with the 
Camberwell centre he toured with his wife yesterday, having made a private 
visit in 2003 when he was 21.

The couple were suitably dressed down
 for the occasion - Kate sported a 
Ralph Lauren olive green jersey dress, clinched at her tiny waist with a
 thick black belt, and knee-length black suede boots. The prince also 
abandoned his habitual suit for blue cords and a jumper and shirt.

During
 their engagement the couple viewed a group session on Centrepoint’s 
‘Workwise’ programme, which enables participants to prepare themselves 
in order to find a job.

William and Kate also took part in a cookery class making low fat festive mince pies and gingerbread.

In
 organising the event shortly before they headed off for the 
traditional royal Christmas at Sandringham, the royal couple were 
following in the footsteps of Princess Diana.

Affectionate: William offered his bride-of-eight-months a guiding hand during the visit

As
 a young boy William and Harry were regularly 
taken by their late mother on private visits to Centrepoint hostels 
across the capital to better understand the lives of those less 
fortunate than themselves.

William
 is now patron of the organisation which works with young homeless 
people and two years ago spent the night sleeping rough publicise the 
plight of the homeless at Christmas.

Centrepoint is a 
national charity providing housing and support to improve the lives of 
homeless young people aged 16-25. At any one time, it works with over 
500 young people providing a range of services to help them tackle the 
issues that can lead to homelessness.

In
 addition to a wide range of accommodation services, Centrepoint also 
ensures young people have access to personal and mental health 
assistance and learning programmes, which enable them to develop the 
skills they need for a sustainable future.

Its
 housing services range from night shelters for emergencies to hostels 
for short stays and supported flats with facilities for learning on 
site.

At ease: The couple looked comfortable in the kitchen and Kate even made a heart-shaped birthday cookie for a girl who was celebrating her 18th birthday

The charity also provides services specifically for young people 
who are leaving the care of the local authority, for ex-offenders and 
for young single parents.

Chief executive Sey Obakin said of 
the royal visit: 'It is a powerful motivator and Prince William is a keen
 and passionate patron.

'I have seen him talk to a young person and remember their story six months later.

'This has been a difficult 12 months for the charity and our young people in particular.

'There
 are one million young people unemployed in this country and ours are at
 the back of the queue as they have no qualifications, no experience and
 have chaotic lives.'
