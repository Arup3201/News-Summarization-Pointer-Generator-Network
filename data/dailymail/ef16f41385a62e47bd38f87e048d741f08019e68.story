One in ten people would take a pay cut if they were allowed to reduce their working week, file picture

One in ten employees feel so overworked they would happily take a pay cut if they could do fewer hours.

The number of overstretched workers has risen 10 per cent over the past year to three million, official figures show.

Chief executives, doctors, dentists and senior police officers were the most ‘overemployed’, with the highest concentration found in the South West. They typically want to cut back 11 hours back a week, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Staff in their 50s and early 60s were keenest for more time off and those in their 20s the least eager. Women were slightly more overworked than men.

The ONS report also shows that one in ten staff wanted to work extra hours to gain more money. Three million people are now classed as ‘underemployed’, a problem most common among waiters, cleaners and sales assistants.

The number of underemployed Britons has fallen only slightly over the past six years, which economists said cast doubts on the country’s ‘jobs miracle’.

The Government has seized on figures showing employment has climbed to 30.7million in the last quarter, the highest since records began in 1971. 

But the ONS report on underemployment, which is affecting 9.9 per cent of the workforce, suggests there is still slack in the economy.

John Philpott, of The Jobs Economist, a research consultancy, said it was the sixth successive year in which the underemployment rate had been above 9.5 per cent. 

He added: ‘Such a prolonged period of mass underemployment demonstrates the extent to which the very good headline employment and unemployment figures of recent years mask a substantial underlying shortage of work, the persistence of which takes some gloss off the UK’s supposed jobs miracle.’

One in five part-timers is underworked compared with one in 20 in a full-time job. 

The North East has the highest percentage of underemployed workers in Britain.

Frances O’Grady, of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘It makes no sense that there are so many people wanting more work, while others complain of being overworked.

‘The Government should strengthen flexible working rights, which could help solve both problems.’

Ministers have already introduced a shake-up giving every worker the right to ask for flexible hours whatever their circumstances. 

But there is no legal requirement for firms to grant the requests.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We have record employment with countless individual stories of hard work and determination.

‘The vast majority of the rise in employment over the last year has been in full-time jobs and more than four out of five people who work part-time do so because they want to.’ 

Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress said it was madness that people were being overworked at a time when there was so many people out of work, she said more flexibility should be encouraged
