It was Frank Leboeuf’s mother who first noticed something in her son’s face that leads to his many deaths these days.

‘Sometimes she would see me playing football or giving an interview and she would call me,’ Leboeuf says. ‘She would ask, “Why are you so sad, Frank. Why are you upset?”

‘I would say, “I am not sad, this is just my face. And you know my face!” But I guess she sees what the directors see. Maybe it is a sad face, even if I am happy. It means I play a certain type of character and they die a lot.’

This is what Leboeuf terms his ‘second life’, more specifically the acting career that has followed the World Cup and European Championship he won, among other things, as a footballer player which sees the Frenchman follow in the footsteps of Manchester United legend Eric Cantona.

It is the life he always wanted, a dream that preceded the one he had to play football. If he gets his wish, it could in time see him regarded as a fine actor who used to play a bit of football. Some of his countrymen in France might stop sniggering.

But it’s a long journey for a legend of Chelsea; it’s many more deaths away.

‘Maybe it is my face,’ Leboeuf says. ‘A lot of my characters have a deep, maybe dark side.

‘I have died many times. In my first play I was killed and I have done eight movies and been killed four times. One was a suicide. I think I die well.

‘But I like these guys. I love to play something I am not. I try to be a nice guy in real life. In the movies I can kill people and be a bad guy and shout. I love that.’

His latest film, Allies, is released on DVD on Monday, while two more are in post-production. Allies pitches the former Chelsea defender as the leader of a French Resistance group in World War II, his role a brief blitz of extreme violence, shouting and shooting.

‘I think my character, Marcel Deville, is a good guy but he likes justice and doesn’t like traitors,’ Leboeuf says. ‘He doesn't treat traitors very well, but he is still a hero. That role was very intense, but good fun.’

Leboeuf, as a child in Marseille, wanted to act more than he wanted the career that would yield two FA Cups, the League Cup, the European Cup Winners Cup and the two major honours of international football.

‘It was my first passion,’ he says. ‘I wanted to become an actor before becoming a football player. Because of my mother I was watching movies and we used to watch plays as well. I told her I wanted to be an actor.

‘But my father created a football academy, so I used to play with my father and friends and it went well. I never had any regrets. But when I gave up my career in 2005 I went to Los Angeles because I was so desperate to learn.’

Leboeuf, who as a Chelsea player in 2001 appeared in his first film, Taking Sides, featuring Harvey Keitel, spent two years in Los Angeles.

‘I was learning everything I could,’ he says. ‘I am putting in the hard work. I am taking this very seriously.

‘I am only aiming for happiness. When I decided to give up my career, in the space of four months we had a family bereavement and I got divorced. I am another person now. I am happier now, more conservative in my private life.

‘Acting is a big part of that. In sport, the goal was titles. In the movie industry, you want to share something artistic, something creative.’

Needless to say, there has been scepticism. ‘I have to admit, it is odd in France,’ he says. ‘When you were a footballer you stay a footballer. But I didn’t decide after one night, “I want to be an actor”. I have earned the right to show what I can do.

‘My job in each role is to make people forget about me as a footballer, to only see my character. Having that life in football is not a plus in my life right now because people never forget what you did. Maybe the new generation will.’

Not that Leboeuf has, or indeed wants, to forget his past life. He calls himself a Chelsea fan. ‘I think they are title favourites,’ he says. ‘It is between them and Manchester City but I think they can do the treble – Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. Diego Costa has made a big difference.

‘For me it is the best squad they’ve had and Mr Mourinho knows exactly how to motivate a team. I think they will win a lot this season.’

His more pressing hope is that the scripts continue arriving at the current rate. And that some of his characters see the final page.
