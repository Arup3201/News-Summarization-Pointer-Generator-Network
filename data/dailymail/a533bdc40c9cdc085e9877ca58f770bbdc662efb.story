International experts have conceded they missed early chances to control the spread of Ebola as they incorrectly believed an initial lull in deaths meant the outbreak was over.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that 'modest further intervention efforts' could have controlled the outbreak in the spring.

They conceded that infighting and finger pointing led to delays in the international response, according to a New York Times investigation.

Allowing the less experienced African branch of the WHO to co-ordinate efforts on the ground and failing to understand how West African attitudes towards issues such as burial might affect the disease's spread also allowed the outbreak to escalate.

Experts incorrectly believed the outbreak was 'over' in April as cases of the disease had slowed. In fact, it had gone underground and would go on to kill 7,800 people by December 2014.

Dr Pierre Rollin, an Ebola specialist at the  Centers for Disease Control (CDC), U.S., who spent nearly two months in Guinea during the early days of the outbreak, said the lack of new cases prompted aid organisations to withdraw and declare the outbreak over.

'This is close to over,' the New York Times reported he said to himself on the plane ride home in April.

'That's it for this outbreak.'

In fact, 20,000 people would go on to contract Ebola and 7,800 have now died.

Dr Rollin said health officials underestimated how much West African practices, especially regarding burial practices, would catalyse the spread of the disease.

'It was an unprecedented outbreak,' he said. 'There were a lot of things we didn't know at that time.'

The first patient died of Ebola in Guinea on December 28 last year, but the virus was not officially recognised until three months later.

The WHO and the Guinean health ministry documented cases of a handful of people dying or being sick with Ebola-like symptoms in Sierra Leone in March, but the information didn't reach the team investigating suspected cases.

The most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was a young boy playing near a colony of virus-infected bats, scientists claim.

The two-year-old boy - described as the index case, or patient zero - became infected and was the first to die in his village in Meliandou, Guinea in December last year.

It is thought 'patient zero' was was Emile Ouamouno, described as a playful toddler by his father Etienne.

Before his death, on December 6, 2013, Emile had been near a tree harbouring the free-tailed bats. 

Researchers from the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin concluded the large colony of free-tailed insectivorous bats were the most likely source of the disease. 

Villagers reported that children often used to play in and around thehollow tree, and may have resulted in a massive exposure to the bats.  

The toddler came down with a sky-high fever, began vomiting and passing black stools. 

It took four days for the disease to claim Emile's life, and he passed away on December 6, 2013.

His sister Philomene fell ill on Christmas Day last year, and was dead before New Year.

Their mother followed, along with their grandmother, Etienne said earlier this year. The disease then spread to other members of the community before spreading to other parts of Guinea.

It was not until May that Sierra Leone recorded its first confirmed cases, prompting infighting and finger pointing among the WHO, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said efforts to help were resisted because African experts wanted to prove they could tackle the disease on their own.

Usually in such situations the CDC would be  brought into outbreaks quickly and given a primary role, and Dr Frieden was surprised this hadn't happened.

He learned that CDC experts were being held up by bureaucratic demands, and were having their credentials checked by the African WHO officials.

'People shouldn't die because someone's embarrassed that they can't do it themselves,' he said.

Aid and experts were sent from the Geneva branch of the WHO, but leadership of the early response was largely delegated to regional WHO representatives on the ground.

Worried, Dr Nils Daulaire, who until February sat on the WHO executive board, said the African office was seen as a place where 'politics trumps substance' and where senior officials are 'often not the cream of the crop'.

A Guinean WHO official who had never been involved in fighting Ebola was put in charge of co-ordinating the response on the ground, ahead of Dr Pierre Formenty, the WHO's top Ebola authority.

Dr Formenty said this was obviously 'only because I was coming from Geneva'.

The WHO's budget for epidemic preparedness and response in Africa had also been more than halved over five years from $26 million (£17 million) in 2010-11 to $11 million (£7 million) for 2014-15, meaning its capacity had shrunk.

By April, when officials were hailing the end of the outbreak, it had simply gone 'underground', with cases going unreported.

Governments attempted to broadcast the message that Ebola was spread through contact with fluids like vomit, faeces and blood, and that bodies were still highly contagious after death.

But communities continued to wash bodies after a burial, as this was believed to lead to contentment in the afterlife.

Villagers complained their relatives taken by health workers to treatment centres never returned and protests outside one Medecin Sans Frontiers (MSF) clinic forced its closure. 

It wasn't until August – nine months after the first case recoded in Guinea – that the WHO declared Ebola was a 'public health emergency of international concern' – a rating which mobilised an international response.

Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola, and Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust concluded the outbreak 'an avoidable crisis'.
