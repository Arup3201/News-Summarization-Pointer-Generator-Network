The 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation is to be marked by a service of celebration at Westminster Abbey.

The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family will attend the event, which is likely to attract thousands to the streets of London.

The service is one of the major highlights of this year's coronation celebrations, along with a four-day festival in Buckingham Palace Gardens in July.

Although the official Diamond Jubilee
celebrations took place last year – the anniversary of the death of 
King George V1 and the Queen’s official accession to the throne – the 
Queen’s actual coronation took place more than a year later, on June 2 
1953.

Buckingham Palace 
said today that the service will take place on Tuesday June 4, a few 
days after the 60th anniversary of the coronation, followed by a lunch.

Foreign
dignitaries are expected to be among the congregation along with 
leading UK figures, from Prime Minister David Cameron and members of his
Cabinet to military chiefs.

A
spokesman for Westminster Abbey also revealed that the Queen’s 
coronation chair – used by almost all kings and queens since the 14th 
Century – will be on display in time for the event following extensive 
restoration.

The delicate 
work has taken many months to undertake and the chair will be presented 
under a new red fabric canopy supported by four posts of turned oak.

The design, by Ptolmy Dean, Surveyor 
of the Fabric at Westminster Abbey, has been inspired by the gold canopy
traditionally used during the anointing ceremony in the coronation.

The Queen acceded to the throne on 
February 6 1952 when her father, George VI, died unexpectedly in his 
sleep at Sandringham in Norfolk.

The
country was still in the grip of post-war austerity but a glittering 
coronation was staged on June 2 the following year at Westminster Abbey,
which saw millions take to the streets in celebration and was broadcast
live on television around the world for the first time.

The
other major celebration of the landmark anniversary will be a festival 
of ‘innovation, excellence and industry’ held in the gardens at 
Buckingham Palace by the Royal Warrant Holders Association from July 11 
to 14.

Displaying the ‘best of British’ – from fashion to technology, car design to food and drink – the palace gardens will be packed with display stands.

A gala performance of music and dance will also be held on a specially-designed stage on selected evenings.

Unlike the official Diamond Jubilee events last year, which were largely free, tickets for the festival are priced at £30 for the daytime event and £90 each evening.

Tickets are available at www.coronationfestival.com.

According to Buckingham Palace, events to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation will be far more low-key than those of the Diamond Jubilee. 

‘The jubilee was very much the focus of the national celebrations,’ a spokesman said.
