Culture Secretary Maria Miller has announced plans for a new media watchdog

Plans to ensure the toughest Press regulation regime in British history which could see papers fined £1million were published yesterday.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller unveiled plans for a Royal Charter to approve a new system of watchdogs in response to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards.

Under the scheme, the newspaper and magazine industry will set up a regulator to give victims of Press intrusion a quick and inexpensive system of seeking redress.

Publishers who sign up will face fines of up to £1million if they break the rules. But under the Tory proposals those who fail to sign up – including bloggers or those who publish news online – could face far larger exemplary damages. Newspaper lawyers say this breaches European law.

The Royal Charter will create a ‘recognition panel’ to decide every three years if the regulator has fulfilled requirements set out by Lord Justice Leveson.

All three main party leaders would have to agree the proposals to recommend them to the Privy Council who would pass them for approval by the Queen.

Crucially, the plans mean there would not have to be new Press laws, which critics say would undermine freedom of speech. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘The Royal Charter would allow the principles of Leveson to be implemented swiftly and in a practical fashion.

It would see the toughest Press regulation this country has ever seen, without compromising Press freedom.’

The plans was welcomed by the industry and the Lib Dems but both raised concerns on details.

Labour complained the proposals did ‘not comply’ with standards laid down by Lord Justice Leveson and said they would seek to change them when cross-party talks on the proposals begin again tomorrow.

The Royal Charter contains provisions to stop meddling by politicians. Any changes must be approved by party leaders and a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament.

But in a letter to the Tories last night, Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman said the Privy Council – made up of senior politicians – can change any Royal Charter.

She said: ‘At the heart of Leveson’s proposals was that a new system should be independent of politicians and independent of the Press.

There is nothing to stop the Privy Council from amending the Charter at any time, thereby changing the terms of the recognition and regulatory framework.’

Industry representatives said the plans do not go far enough to safeguard Press interests.Supreme Court judge Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, chairman of the appointments committee, would pick Press representative on the recognition panel. The rules exclude serving editors and publishers.

The plans also ban anyone who has ever been an editor from serving on the recognition panel. This has raised concerns that the panel will lack the necessary expertise.

Paul Vickers, Chair of the Newspaper and Magazine Industry Implementation Group, welcomed ‘this very constructive announcement’. He said the regulatory body should be set up ‘without statute, which would raise dangerous constitutional questions’.

He added: ‘We remain opposed to exemplary damages, which are unnecessary, unjust and against European law, and we have grave reservations about the proposed arrangements for appointments to the Recognition Panel.

‘However these are issues which can be addressed over the coming days: the newspaper and magazine industry are determined to have a new, Leveson-recommended regulatory system up and running as soon as possible.’

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘The onus is now clearly on those who oppose statute to demonstrate a Royal Charter approach can be shown to meet the requirements set out by Leveson. We are not yet convinced today’s proposals meet that test, but we welcome them as a starting point.’

Campaign group Hacked Off rejected the plan. Gerry McCann, father of missing girl Madeleine said: ‘This plan falls far short of Leveson.’
