Danny Talbot led the home nation charge in the 200 metres heats, with the English sprinter easing through to into the Commonwealth Games semi finals as joint-second fastest qualifier.

The 23-year-old is unlikely to replicate compatriot Leon Baptiste's gold medal of four years ago, but represents the best chance of a British podium finish.

Talbot went in the fourth of 10 heats at Hampden Park on Wednesday morning and won with ease, slowing up as he crossed the line in 20.56 seconds.

'I've had a really good couple of weeks of training, I feel good,' the British champion said.

'I've been around my PB a lot this season and in different conditions, mainly into headwinds, so I feel if the conditions are good I should go a lot faster than my PB.

'Watching Adam [Gemili] on Monday night - I've been really good friends with Adam for a few years now - he's inspired us all [with his silver in the 100m].

'I was watching it on TV back in the village and from our block you could hear all the other English guys cheer when he crossed the line.'

Talbot is joined in Thursday's semi-finals by Northern Ireland's Leon Reid, who qualified as a fastest loser, as well as England team-mates Christopher Clarke and James Ellington after the pair finished second in their heats.

The latter finished behind Jason Livermore of Jamaica, who clearly irked the Londoner before their heat.

'That clown on the outside, the Jamaican guy, he spurred me on because he was making noise in the call room,' Ellington told BBC One after his 20.73 secs run.

'He shouldn't do that, it just makes me run faster. As long as he does that in the semi-final too though you know what I mean?'

Livermore downplayed his chat with Ellington as they crossed the line, though.

'I'm just enjoying myself you know,' he said. 'Honestly, he's a nice competitor, I'd give him that. Tomorrow's the semi-finals so let's see what happens tomorrow.'

Livermore's Jamaica team-mate and 200m favourite Warren Weir eased through to the semis, winning his heat in 20.71s.
