John Kerry said  he will now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks attended by 40 world leaders and a million people

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he will now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks. 

The rally was attended by 40 world leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, and a million people. 

A staggering 3.7 million people gathered across France today to stage further defiant marches in a moving tribute to the 17 people killed in hostage sieges last week.

Kerry said at a news conference that U.S. officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities almost immediately after the first attack occurred and had offered intelligence assistance.

As to criticism about the lack of a senior U.S. official at Sunday's March, Kerry said: 'I really think that this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched.

'As everybody knows, I have been here in India for a prior planned event,' he added. 

'I would have personally very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.' 

Kerry was in the Indian city of Ahmedabad on Sunday for a long-scheduled appearance at an international investment conference, and to prepare for President Barack Obama's trip to India later this month. 

But another high-ranking administration official, Attorney General Eric Holder, was in Paris at the time for a terrorism summit, and he didn't attend the march, either.

It it not known why Holder didn't join other world leaders on the streets of Paris. The Department of Justice did not return DailyMail.com's request for comment on the matter.

The outgoing AG did have time to appear on four different American news shows on Sunday that aired during the rally, though it was not immediately clear if the interviews were pre-taped.

Calling France the United States' 'oldest ally,' President Obama said Friday, 'I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.'

Two days later no U.S. officials, save for the relatively unknown deputy secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to France Jane Hartley, stood with the French at the unity march against barbarity, however.

According to an administration official, President Obama spent part of his Sunday afternoon watching a National Football League game on television. 

The White House did not release any details on the president's activities yesterday nor did it respond to DailyMail.com's request for confirmation that Obama's took the afternoon off to watch the playoffs.

Both games were broadcast hours after the march. 

More than 40 world leaders from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and even Russia attended the historic rally in Paris, but President Obama was conspicuous by his absence.

Even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas put aside their differences and linked arms.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov  made the same unifying gesture in the march down the Place de la Concorde in defiance of the Islamist terror attacks that rocked the city last week. 

The absence of a strong U.S. presence at the event rankled Republicans, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, calling it 'dangerous' and 'symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage.'

'The attack on Paris, just like previous assaults on Israel and other allies, is an attack on our shared values,' Cruz wrote in a Monday op-ed in Time. 

'Many of our allies gathered together in Paris yesterday in an admirable display of determination. Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies,' he said. ''We should never hesitate to speak the truth. In Paris or anywhere else in the world.'

Echoing Obama's words on Friday, Kerry said today that he would go to France to reaffirm U.S. solidarity with country's longtime ally. He said as soon as he heard about the march, he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could go.

'That is why I am going there on the way home and to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,' he said. 

'I don't think he people of France have any doubt about America's understanding about what happened, about our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trial.'

While in Paris, Kerry will be meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and pay tribute to the victims of last week's attacks, which killed 17 people. 

Kerry is a fluent French speaker, has a well-known affinity for France and has visited Paris more than a dozen times since becoming secretary of state.

He will arrive in Paris on Thursday after stops in Islamabad, Pakistan and Sofia, Bulgaria and Geneva, Switzerland.

The previously unannounced drop-in to Islamabad dovetails Kerry's meetings in India, Pakistan's geopolitical foe, and a Dec. 16 terror attack  that claimed the lives of 134 children and 16 adults at an army-run school in Peshawar. 

'The secretary's engagement will be very critical to advancing our shared fight against militant extremism,' a senior official at State told Agence France-Presse.

While there Kerry will assess whether the country is truly committed to a 'real and sustained effort' to thwart terrorism, U.S. officials travelling with Kerry told CBS News.

In Geneva, on Wednesday, Kerry will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to discuss the status of nuclear negotiations that are to resume the next day.

Kerry will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit France since the terrorist attacks on a French newspaper and a kosher supermarket. 

Authorities say one of those involved in the attacks pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video. He and two other suspected extremists were killed during police raids.

'I want to emphasize that the relationship with France is not about one day or one particular moment,' Kerry said. 

'It is an ongoing longtime relationship that is deeply, deeply based in the shared values, and particularly the commitment that we share to freedom of expression.'

'No single act of terror, no two people with  a AK-47s, no hostage-taking at a grocery store is ever going to prevent those who are committed to the march for freedom to continue to march and to ultimately see all people enjoy their rights, to be able to enjoy the protections that come with that freedom,' he said. 

Obama offered condolences last week at the French Embassy in Washington. 

'We stand united with our French brothers to ensure that justice is done and our way of life is defended,' he said.

The U.S. president will host British PM Cameron at the White House on Thursday and Friday to discuss counter terrorism measures in addition to other global issues that include international trade, cybersecurity, Iran, ISIS and Russia's continued occupation of eastern Ukraine.
