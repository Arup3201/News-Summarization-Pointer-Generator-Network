Attacked: Sir John Gurdon, 80, was throttled by his alcoholic son in the family's mansion, a judge was told

The alcoholic son of a Nobel Prize winning biologist tried to strangle his father and hit his mother in the family's £1.8million home, a court heard.

William Gurdon, 45, attacked his father Professor Sir John Gurdon, 80, and mother Lady Jean when they confronted him about his drinking.

The unemployed man - who admitted carrying out the assault on his elderly parents - is addicted to alcohol and has previously been treated at The Priory, the judge was told.

His father, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2012 for pioneering cloning research, was attacked when he told his son he should go to rehab again.

Following the incident, Gurdon moved out of the family home in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, and was staying in a £140-a-night bed and breakfast.

But Cambridge Magistrates Court heard that his parents have forgiven him and he is now undergoing treatment.

On the day of the attack, Lady Jean, 77, made her son a full English breakfast after smelling that he had been drinking at 8.30am, the judge heard.

After cleaning his plate Gurdon went back to his room, but returned to the kitchen later to make a pizza for lunch.

While he was there, his father suggested that it was time for his son to confront his drinking. When Lady Jean returned home, her son had become 'very aggressive'.

Magistrates in Cambridge heard how he 'lurched' towards his father and pushed his mother to the ground before 'squeezing his neck'. Lady Jean called the police and he was later arrested.

District Judge Ken Sheraton said: 'Your behaviour was disgraceful. Your parents have given you money and provided you with a place to live, and you treated them in the way you have.

'You got drunk and pushed your mother over so she hit her head on the floor causing injury.

'You then pushed your father onto the floor and grabbed him by the throat and attempted to strangle him.

'I would like to send you straight to prison today but it seems your parents have not requested a restraining order, which suggests there may be a time when they would have you back in their lives.

'The only way it would be safe for that to happen is for you to stop drinking at all, and you would not receive that help in prison.'

Gurdon admitted two counts of assault when he appeared before the judge yesterday.

The court heard he was drunk when police arrived at the family home on October 31 and he claimed to have a knife - though a weapon was never found.

Paul Brown, prosecuting, told the 
court: 'The defendant has problems with alcohol and was drinking half a 
bottle of Bacardi a day. He had previously been to the The Priory rehab 
clinic.

'When Jean got back home at 1.30pm, William was being very aggressive towards his father.

'Then
 suddenly William lurched towards John and pushed his mother out of the 
way, knocking her to the floor causing a cut to her head.

'When she got up she saw John on his back on the floor with William standing over him and his hands squeezing his neck.

'She tried to pull him off but he was too strong so she shouted at him. John was making choking noises.'

In a victim statement read to the court by Mr Brown, Lady Jean said there was 'no excuse' for her son's behaviour.

It read: 'I am shocked at what William has done. Alcohol may have been a cause but it doesn't excuse him for try to strangle his father.'

Nick Symonds, mitigating, said it was an 'unusual living situation' which had come about partly due to his client's epilepsy.

He said: 'He has struggled to find work and has no money of his own, other than £20,000 of savings which he was given by his parents.

'At the time of the offence he was drinking everyday and now he only drinks two evenings a week.'

Gurdon, who has no previous convictions, was given a six-week prison sentence suspended for a year, with 12 months of supervision, including an alcohol treatment programme.

He must also pay £85 court costs.

Speaking after the hearing, Lady Jean, who also has a daughter, said her son would now be moving back into their mansion.

She said: 'William has been very remorseful; his actions had a lot to do with drink.

'We are welcoming him back to our home and he is trying to get himself cured of all his problems. We love him dearly and want to help him.

'These past weeks have been awful for the family as we haven’t been able to see William.

'Now we want to put the incident behind us and move forward.'

Sir John Gurdon had the Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University named after him in 2004.

It is the home to developmental biology research, focusing on how cells acquire and maintain their normal functions.
