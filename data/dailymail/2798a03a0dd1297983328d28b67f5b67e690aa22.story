Scottish banks are filling up cash machines in case of a dash to withdraw money in the event off a Yes vote.

The move to keep ATMs stocked is part of a package of measures put in place in an effort to avoid financial panic.

Banking industry sources insist there will be no immediate risk to anyone’s savings if Scotland votes to split from the rest of the UK.

But senior figures have recognised the risk that some people will be concerned and start to withdraw money. 

Should cash machines run dry it could fuel public fear. ‘We did not have to be asked by the Bank of England, it is just a natural part of what we said we would do,’ said one bank source.

Pledges to keep cash machines full are part of the contingency plans all banks are understood to have submitted to the Bank of England ahead of the vote.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has confirmed it has a contingency plan of its own in place, but has given no details.

In the event of a Yes vote, the Governor is expected to make an emergency statement, reassuring bank customers and markets that the Bank of England would remain the regulator and the lender of last resort to banks in Scotland until independence was formally declared, which Alex Salmond has said would occur about 18 months after a Yes vote.

Until then, all deposits in Scotland would also still be covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects savings up to the value of £85,000.

Banks have reported rising concern among both business and personal customers over what a Yes vote might mean.

There have been reports of customers moving cash from Scottish to English branches, but it is understood that the levels of movement have not yet caused alarm at the Bank of England.

Last week five banks legally based in Scotland – Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale, TSB and Tesco Bank – all said that they would move their official home to England in the event of a Yes vote.
