A young father who lost both legs and an arm when a cold developed into a flesh-eating bug is facing the prospect of losing his last remaining limb.

Triple amputee Alex Lewis contracted Group A streptococcus last November, which then developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome.

The 34-year-old battled against the odds
 to make a remarkable recovery after doctors gave him a three per cent 
chance of survival.

Doctors were forced to amputate the 34-year-old's legs above the knee as well as his left arm.

Alex Lewis (pictured with his partner, Lucy, and son, Sam) will have his last remaining limb, his right arm, amputated after losing both legs and his left arm to a flesh-eating bug

But a 16-hour operation to reconstruct his remaining arm, temporarily saved the limb.

Last
 Friday, months after his initial operation, Mr Lewis, who returned home
 earlier this month, broke his remaining arm in three places.

As he rolled over and tried to push himself up, he heard a snap.

In
 a cruel twist of fate, hospital scans have revealed the Group A 
streptococcus caused an infection and seriously damaged the bones 
leaving them weak and irreparable.

The
 former pub landlord now faces six weeks in Salisbury District Hospital 
in Wiltshire, where doctors will also perform surgery to reconstruct his
 lips.

Despite the prospect of his future as a quadruple amputee, Mr Lewis has called the news a 'minor setback'.

In
 a message to all those who have supported him, he said: 'All of you 
make this minor setback a walk in the park, excuse the pun.

'With
 all your support I continue to feel humbled everyday and I still can't 
thank everyone enough for what they have done and what they are about to
 do for the trust. You are all amazing.'

Streptococcus, a normally harmless bacteria, is 
usually filtered out by the body but in the father-of-one's case, it 
developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome.

Mr Lewis's major organs shut down and he spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body.

Mr Lewis (pictured with his partner and son before his illness) thought he had developed a cold in November but he had actually contracted strep A which wreaked havoc throughout his body and left him close to death

Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin.

The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo.

Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood, muscles or the lungs.

The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores.

Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs.

Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis (infection of muscle and fat tissue) and toxic shock syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs).

The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site.

The early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain.

Doctors
 had to amputate both his legs above the knee and his left arm after his
 feet, fingertips, arms, lips, nose and part of his ears turned black.

He
 also lost part of his nose, his lips and underwent a pioneering 16-hour
 operation to reconstruct his remaining arm in a bid to save it.

Medics told his partner Lucy Townsend - who runs The Greyhound pub in Stockbridge, Hampshire - he wouldn’t make it.

But just six months later, the 34-year-old was back home and playing with his three-year-old son Sam.

He
 said he felt lucky to be returning home, and that he had his remaining 
arm to help him do the things most people take for granted - like 
sending a short email on his iPad using the underside of his little 
finger.

He said the nerves were re-growing impressively and was expecting to be able to feel his thumb twitch shortly.

But that has tragically been taken from him, as he prepares to adapt to life as a quadruple amputee.

His
 local community in Stockbridge are holding a fundraising festival for 
the Al Lewis Trust but Mr Lewis can no longer wheel himself onto the 
stage.

Ms Townsend,  said: 'He is still wonderful and full of spirits.

'He’s a little scared in case they find something else but he hasn’t lost his sense of humour.

Mr Lewis is set to have surgery to rebuild his lips in the next six weeks, to allow him to eat and speak normally

Mr Lewis hopes he will soon learn to  walk on prosthetic legs

'We hope they will amputate below the elbow but they won’t know until they operate and see how badly damaged the arm is.'

The
 family home has been adapted to suit Mr Lewis’s wheelchair needs and 
his best friend Chris Bagley has become his full time carer.

Before
 he was re-admitted to hospital, Mr Lewis said: 'Our whole life has been
 turned upside down but for me, there’s a lot of clarity.

'I feel I’ve experienced life and death and I am just so lucky to be here.'

After his operation to reconstruct his lips, Mr Lewis will go to a specialist unit in 
Roehampton, south west London, for ten weeks to learn skills to regain 
his independence.

This includes taking his first steps on prosthetic legs.

He said: ‘Words cannot describe how much I can’t wait to get walking.

‘All
 Sam talks about now is “daddy when you get your legs you can kick a 
ball about in the garden” and “when you get your legs you can do this, 
that and the other”.

‘The frustration is when I watch Sam playing in the garden out of the window and I can’t play with him.

Mr Lewis says he is delighted to be back at home with his partner, Lucy, and his son, Sam

‘To think I could be walking by the end of the summer is just incredible.

‘But
 it doesn’t take anything spectacular to make me feel great. It’s these 
simple things, the normal things that make me so happy.

‘Just the other day Chris and I were sat here watching the golf, like mates do, and that was a lovely feeling.

‘It was just like the old days when we used to kick back, and at that point there wasn’t a care in the world.

‘But
 despite what has changed, I’m not bitter or angry. I’m proud of the 
fact I don’t think I’m mentally any different to how I was when I went 
into hospital.

‘I wouldn’t change anything - no way.’
