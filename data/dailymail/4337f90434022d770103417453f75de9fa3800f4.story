Health guru Hazel Walsh knows exactly what her clients desperate to lose weight are going through - as she has had to battle her own food demons to become the slim size 10 she is today.

The 26-year-old, from Bradshaw, suffered from depression and bulimia when she was a dress size 24 weighing 18 stone - but she's turned her life around and now wants to help others do the same.

Hazel used to comfort eat on cakes and cookies but - after having surgery to kick start her weightloss - she has now learnt how to eat healthily and exercise to stay in shape.

Hazel at her heaviest: 18st and a dress size 24, left, and now a slim size 10 after losing more than 7st

Hazel started putting on weight as a teenager and was bullied as a result.

Once she was humiliated when she was asked out on a date which she later found out was a dare to 'pull a fat girl'.

She recalled of her youth: 'I was tall and gangly - 5ft 7in - then the weight started piling on so I was a target for bullies.

'I stopped being social and playing 
sports and started comfort eating to try to isolate myself. I just ate more food - I started eating junk food, takeaways 
and fast food. I always had cakes and cookies after school.'

Drastic measure: Hazel has a £6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the Czech Republic to kick start her weightloss

Hazel admitted she suffered episodes of binge eating and bulimia and tried various diets that left her even more depressed when she failed to lose weight. She became so down she was prescribed anti-depression tablets.

She said: 'The antidepressants 
made me put on more weight so I stopped after two years and decided 
something needed to be done.'

At age 24, a size 24 and at her wits' 
end, Miss Walsh booked a £6,500 gastric sleeve operation in the Czech Republic.

She started blogging about her experience at prettyfat.co.uk, documenting her 
mental as well as physical recovery and progress as she shed more than 7st.

Made a career out of her experiences: She has now trained to be a nutritionist so she can help others lose weight

She said: 'I know surgery is drastic 
but I'd already tried every diet under the sun. I have been dieting 
since I was about 15 and none of them did anything - or if they did the 
weight went back on when I came off the diet.

'I started to write a blog about my 
progress and I've had people contact me asking me about diet and 
fitness. I was flattered that they asked me, so I thought I would do it 
as a career.

'I started to learn all about 
nutrition and fitness and signed up to a distance learning course last 
year. I am just waiting for my diploma certificate in Level 3 Diet and 
Nutrition which means I can advise others. I hope to do another qualification in fitness in the future too.'

Hazel said she is now the happiest she has ever been and has launched her own business -  healthyeats.co.uk - which she hopes will help others who were in the same position as she was.

Help from someone who has been there: Hazel said her weightloss journey helps her know what her clients are going through

She said: 'I am now a size 10 and have lost just over seven stone and I now want to help individuals like me.

'I'll be offering advice on emotional eating, obesity and weight loss, binge eating, compulsive overeating, weight loss surgery and food intolerances.

'I'm aiming to provide clients with a meal plan that they can follow and recipes. I've done all the diets in the world so I know it's easy to be given a plan but when you come off it you put the weight back on so I want to try to teach them to plan what foods to eat and teach them to make healthy recipes.'
