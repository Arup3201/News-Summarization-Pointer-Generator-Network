This is the terrifying moment an elderly couple dramatically escaped their boat after it caught fire.

The pleasure vessel burst into flames on the River Ouse estuary at around 8am today, and the scene was watched by Nick and Linda Hitchen from their home near Blacktoft, East Yorkshire.

A Royal National Lifeboat Institution crew raced to the scene and a man and a woman were rescued from a dinghy - which was already melting in the heat - attached to the rear of the Moonraker boat.

Heat from the flames melted the entire top of the boat before it sank in less than an hour, but both people on board the 36ft vessel - a man and a woman said to be in their 60s - were rescued unhurt.

Mr Hitchen, 46, an HGV driver, said: ‘My wife Linda called me out to the garden and we saw this boat on fire and a couple in a dinghy on the back of it. It was melting the heat was so intense.

‘They were both rescued by the RNLI, and there were four fire engines at the scene but there was nothing they could do. You could see the flames take hold so quickly. 

'The boat had apparently had engine trouble and stopped. We don’t know why it caught fire.’

Graham Anderson from Humber Rescue said the fire was a danger to other boats on the river.

He
added: ‘The heat would have been quite intense. Plus, you don’t know 
what’s going to explode, so obviously you’ve got to keep your distance 
from the vessel.

‘Luckily, the people had got into the 
small boat so they were at a safe distance so we can safely transfer 
them on to the rescue boat.’

'The heat would have been quite intense. Plus, you don’t know what’s going to explode'

Martin Rumford, trustee and coxswain at Humber Rescue, added: 'This incident serves as an illustration as to how quickly things can escalate, leaving crew members with no option but to abandon their vessel.

'We cannot emphasise enough the need to make sure that all of your safety and communication equipment is checked and working before setting out on a journey.'

Humberside Fire and Rescue said the boat was well alight when firefighters arrived and was carrying a gas cylinder and 125 litres of diesel fuel.

But they said the two people on board were rescued by Humber Rescue before the crews arrived and no-one was injured. The service's firefighting tug boat was mobilised but not used.
