Tragic: Private Steven Murray, 23, died after hitting his head while larking around with a friend during training at Halton Camp near Lancaster

A soldier died after he smashed his head on a concrete floor during a drunken play-fight with a comrade at an army training camp where heavy drinking was encouraged, an inquest heard yesterday.

Private Steven Murray, 23, who had been drinking vodka sneaked into the barracks, suffered a fractured skull after he was grabbed by the legs and pulled to the ground whilst wrestling with best friend James Cox, 24, in front of fellow squaddies.

Despite complaining of a sore head, feeling sick and showing a cricket-ball sized swelling to his temple, Pte Murray was allowed to go bed by senior officers after insisting he wanted to sleep it off.

The alarm was raised at 5.30am the following morning when colleagues failed to wake him up, noticed he was not breathing and called for an ambulance to the Halton Camp near Lancaster.

Pte Murray, from East Kilbride, near Glasgow, was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead just 80 minutes later with a bleed to the brain.

Blood tests showed he was almost three times the legal driving limit.

The inquest heard that drinking large quantities of alcohol was 'an army way of life' among recruits, with breaches of rules allowed to go lightly punished.

The tragedy occurred on June 3, 2010, after Pte Murray of the Royal Regiment of Scotland based at Catterick Garrison Camp in North Yorkshre, was 11 weeks into his training.

He and fellow members of his platoon had arrived at the camp on May 31 to take part in adventure training in the Lake District including kayaking, caving and climbing.

But tragedy struck after some of the soldiers - known as the 'Naughty Eight' - broke army rules and sneaked into an off licence to buy bottles of vodka whilst on their way to a kayaking exercise.

A small bottle was said to have been passed round the squaddies before the exercise and the rest was hidden in army back packs and smuggled back to camp before being drunk after dinner. Cox also sneaked out of camp to get Strongbow, Stella and more vodka.

At 8.30pm in a dormitory, Murray got Cox in a headlock only for Cox to grab Murray’s legs and throw him backwards causing both to tumble to the floor on top of each other.

The hearing was told there was a 'very loud bang' when Murray’s head hit the floor and he was momentarily knocked unconscious.

By the time a corporal arrived he had come round and went to speak to the Platoon leader for 40 minutes.

He returned complaining about a sore head and was sick but was said to have shrugged off the incident and wanted to be left in peace to sleep.

Murray initially fell asleep on his top bunk, but as he was restless was moved to a mattress on the floor whilst colleagues took it in turns to watch him for the next few hours.

Cox who has since left the army after a tour of Afghanistan said: 'We were best mates all the way through training. He was a bit wild like me and he was always trying to make the lads laugh and cause a bit of mischief.

'When he was in camp he would drink anything that was there. I bought a half bottle of vodka but Murray couldn’t get served so one of the lads got him his.

'We couldn’t get a big bottle because it wouldn’t fit in our army gear. I put it straight down my boxers as we walked out. The instructors didn’t even know about it.

'The lads would have been on the booze as soon as they got back to the accommodation. We are the Naughty Eight who are always getting in to trouble.'

He added: 'Me and Murray were always taking the p*** out of each other him calling me an English b****** and me calling him a Scottish b******.

'He got me in a headlock between his legs my head was lower than his knees. I bear hugged his legs and grabbed his a*** and we both fell backwards.

'That’s when I heard the bang from his head so I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t lift him no higher than knee height. He came around. I can remember him saying "I’m okay"’. He said, "I have been hit around the head with with a bat before, I’m okay".

'Way of life': The inquest into the death of Private Steven Murray's inquest heard, who died after a drunken play-fight at British Army Training Camp in Halton near Lancaster, pictured, head that the army encourage soldiers to drink

'He said "get out of my way I want to be on my own". I let him go and lie down. He said he had always been in and out of fights all of his life. No one thought anything until he fell off the bed and he was a different colour.

'Looking back everyone can say we should have done this and that, but as a friend he was telling me to p*** off and that’s what I did.'

Speaking of life in the army barracks in Catterick he said: 'Every single weekend we would get drunk, we trained all week and then get drunk.

'We knew if we got caught we would be punished, we got punished with fitness, that was a bonus for lads in the army. The army encourages us to drink it’s just the army way of life, they told us at the weekend to go out with the lads and get drunk.'

Eye witness Pte Kevin Fletcher said: 'I recall Cox and Murray messing about - it was normal to have a laugh and a little play. They were were trying to touch each other’s faces - not intentionally to hurt, but just playing.'

He said the pair adopted a boxing stance before grabbing each other around the upper body. Pte Fletcher added: 'It was like a bear hug type move, moving and twisting around. Cox tried to pick Murray up off his feet and lifted him about six inches off the floor.

'They were grappling with each other. I am not sure whether one person slipped or whether they both slipped together or tripped on each other’s foot. I just remember them both hitting their heads.'

Concern: Private James Smith, pictured, giving evidence at Preston Coroners Court, said he was concerned about the injury but Private Steven Murray did not want to make a fuss

'Later when Private Murray got back in bed he wanted to listen to his MP3 player. He had his headphones on, I personally asked him if he wanted a drink of water, but he said ‘no he was okay’ and said he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. He told us to leave him but we were worries about him and were checking.

'We were all concerned because he had a lump on his head, just above his temple. It was the size of a cricket ball split in two. It was a dark in colour, it looked like there was blood on the surface. I got the impression he was dazed, he didn’t know where he was when he first came around.'

Fellow soldier Jake Challinor said: 'The lads were planning on having a drink when they got back and I became aware of people outside getting a bit boisterous, a bit loud as you would do when drinking.'

'It was just a little bit of push and shove, who’s the strongest type-thing. It was drunken boisterous antics - I just remember seeing Steven on the floor. It was some play fighting gone wrong. Cox has done this kind of thing before, I am pretty sure he didn’t meant to hurt Pte Murray.'

Pt James Smith said: 'Steven didn’t want anyone to make a fuss. He was quite embarrassed at the time because Private Cox got the better of him. Half an hour after he said "I’m going to get my head down now".

'I didn’t think it was a good idea because when you have a head injury it isn’t best I know it’s not a good idea. He was brushing it off, not wanting help, telling the lads ‘I’ve had worse’.'

The inquest continues.
