Age is nothing but a number, the old saying goes.

But the way in which our appearance changes as we grow older is clear to see in a thought-provoking video produced by a Dutch filmmaker.

Jeroen Wolf found 100 people, ranging in age from nought to 100, and persuaded them to reveal on camera how old they were.

He then put all the clips together to make a poignant video showing the volunteers counting to 100 - revealing how the ageing process alters how we look as we continue on life's journey.

...to the oldest: The video ends with this woman revealing that she is 100 years old

Mr Wolf said his job was easiest collecting shots of youths and middle-aged people, but that he had more difficulty accessing the very young and very old, who are more vulnerable and protected.

He admitted that his collection was not completely representative of the population of Amsterdam, where the project was filmed, as representatives of some minorities were more reluctant to appear on camera than others.

Mr Wolf said: 'In October 2011 I started documenting people in the city of Amsterdam, approaching them in the street and asking them to say their age in front of the camera.

'My aim was to "collect" a group of 100 people, from age 0 to 100.

'At first my collection grew fast but slowed down when it got down to the very young and very old. The young because of sensivity around filming or photographing children and the very old because they don't get out of the house much.

'I found my very old "models" in care homes and it was a privilege to document these - often vulnerable - people for this project.

'I had particular problems finding a 99 year-old. (Apparently 100 year-olds enjoy notoriety, but a 99 year-old is a rare species...)

'And when I finally did find one, she refused to state her age.

'She simply denied being 99 years old! But finally, some four months after I recorded my first "age", I was able to capture the "missing link" and conclude this project.'
