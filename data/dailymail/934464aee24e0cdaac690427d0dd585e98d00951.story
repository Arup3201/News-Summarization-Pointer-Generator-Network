One of the soldiers accused of 
hounding Private Danny Chen to his death punched and choked his former girlfriend in a sadistic beating in 2001, it has emerged.

Specialist Ryan Offutt stripped her and threw her on a
bed 'so hard that she smashed into the headboard.' The victim told 
police she believed she 'was going to die,' court records show.

The revelations have emerged as eight
soldiers have been charged over the death of fellow soldier Danny Chen 
in Afghanistan, in a suicide case that has rocked the Army.

Criminal: Specialist Ryan Offutt punched and choked his ex-girlfriend, stripping her, in a sadistic beating in 2001

Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, 
was found in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after 
apparently committing suicide.

The Army described Private Chen as 
having 'an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound' when found in southern
Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

It is now no longer clear whether Private Chen, who was from the Chinatown area of Manhattan, did in fact take his own life.

The beefy, Offutt from Greenville, who measured more than 6ft is thought to have been among the worst of the alleged bullies.

The 32-year-old is one of four 
soldiers facing the most heinous charges: negligent homicide, reckless 
endangerment and assault and battery. If convicted all four face up to 
15 years in jail

In October 2001 Offutt was charged with aggravated assault and attempted rape, the Daily News reported.

His former girlfriend told police he beat her and ripped off her clothes.

'Offutt tried to have intercourse with her,' a criminal complaint alleged. She 'had to fight Offutt to escape.'

In action: Sergeant Travis F. Carden was one of eight soldiers charged

The soldier's roommates woke up to 
the noise of the girl screaming, the complaint states. They found her 
'naked and bleeding from the face.'

Offutt pleaded guilty to simple 
assault and indecent assault and was sentenced to four months to two 
years in prison.  He was also obliged to attend drug and alcohol 
treatment.

Offutt joined the army in 2006 and is  based at Fort Wainright, Alaska.

First Lt. Daniel Schwartz, the only officer charged with Chen’s death, also has a record, the Daily News reported.

The 25-year-old Maryland man was arrested five yeasr ago for possession of a controlled substance, according to records.

Eight U.S. Army soldiers have been 
charged over the death of an Asian-American soldier in Afghanistan who 
was allegedly severely racially bullied.

Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide.

The Army described Private Chen as 
having ‘an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound’ when found in southern
Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

Hundreds of supporters held a vigil last
week after demanding officials address the treatment of Asians in the 
military, reported MSNBC.

His cousin Banny Chen read out a 
letter sent by Private Chen in February at the vigil last Thursday, 
which said: ‘Everyone knows me by Chen’.

‘They ask if I'm from China a few 
times a day,’ he wrote. ‘They also call out my name Chen in a goat-like 
voice sometimes for no reason.

‘People crack jokes about Chinese people all the time. I'm running out of jokes to come back at them.’

Around 400 people were at the vigil and march last week in Manhattan as Occupy Wall Street protesters also got involved.

Asian Pacific Americans civil rights 
group OCA has expressed outrage at what happened and have their own 
theory on why he was allegedly abused.

‘They did it because they knew that 
there was an environment that they would get away with it,’ an OCA 
spokesman said, reported NBC New York.

Relatives of Private Chen said on Wednesday they are encouraged to learn of the charges brought.

His father Yen Tao Chen said the family realises he will never return, but the news 'gives us some hope'.

First Lieutenant Daniel J. Schwartz, Staff Sergeant Blaine G. Dugas and Staff Sergeant Andrew J. Van Bockel were all charged.

Sergeant Adam M. 
Holcomb, Sergeant Jeffrey T. Hurst, Specialist Thomas P. Curtis, Specialist Ryan J. Offutt and Sergeant Travis F. Carden were also charged.

All eight soldiers are of 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker 
Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.
