Trainer Colin Tizzard says Cue Card has been showing ‘electric’ form in his home work as he attempts to win the Haydock’s Betfair Chase for the second year running.

Daryl Jacob’s mount was fourth to God’s Own in the two-mile Haldon Gold Cup at the start of the month, his first run since finishing second to Silviniaco Conti, one of his rivals on Saturday, in the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day.

That effort from the 3-1 favourite, his first since recuperating from a pelvis injury, left some questioning his status going into the more suitable longer test.

But Tizzard, who combined with Jacob to win the Oaks Loans Graduation Chase with Third Intention, is in no doubt.

‘He hadn’t run for 10 and a half months,’ said the trainer. ‘We were giving away stacks of weight. Daryl is positive, he said, “Would any of the three-mile chasers we are taking on have done any better in that race?” I doubt it.

‘It has sharpened him up brilliantly. I said after his very first race that no-one could hold him and he is a bit like that now. He has gone from coming up the gallops just off the bridle to electric.’

Jacob, who also won the opener at Haydock on Emma Lavelle’s Closing Ceremony, added: ‘I have been buzzing about this horse since Exeter.

‘Some people questioned the form but I think it was a blinding run. I think you will see a great horse.’

Meanwhile, the Irish Turf Club will decide on Saturday the punishment Cheltenham Festival winning trainer Philip Fenton must face after banned anabolic steroids were found at his Co Tipperary stable.
