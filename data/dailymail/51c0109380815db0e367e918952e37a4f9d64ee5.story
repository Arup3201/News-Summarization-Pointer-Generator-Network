The family of Uriel Jaurez-Popoca allege that dropping the Mexican man at a Taco Bell was part of a 'perverse joke' about his heritage

The family of a drunk Mexican father who was run over and killed after police dropped him off at a Taco Bell instead of arresting him are suing the force for racial discrimination.

Uriel Juarez-Popoca, 22, was hit and killed while walking along a four-lane highway on June 28 2012 near Columbus, shortly after Ohio state police found him sitting in his truck while clearly intoxicated.

But instead of arresting him, the officers took him five miles away to the nearest Taco Bell before leaving him there, an act which the family claims is part of a 'perverse joke' about his heritage.

The family has now launched legal action for unspecified damages against the Delaware County Sheriff's Office in Ohio, several of the agency's deputies and an officer with the Ohio State Highway Patrol.

According to Courthouse News Service, the complaint reads: 'Violating all of their own rules of conduct and safety, defendants ridiculed Mr. Popoca as a Mexican, ultimately leaving him disoriented and intoxicated in a dangerous area where he was predictably killed by a passing motorist.

'The defendants mocked and ridiculed Mr. Popoca based on his Hispanic or Mexican national origin. Defendant Trooper Carpenter failed to stop the discriminatory behavior of the deputies.

'Defendant Deputy Beggs then advised defendant Trooper Carpenter that they were going to transport Mr. Popoca to a nearby Taco Bell.'

Police said at the time that they dropped Juarez-Popoca off at the Taco Bell expecting him to call for a ride.

However the lawsuit alleges the officers received numerous calls about him 
from the store manager and drivers along the highway during the 50-minute 
period after they dropped him off, and failed to take proper action

Juarez-Popoca, who was working in the U.S. at the time and sending money back to his wife, two children and parents in Mexico, was hit on U.S. 36 just north of Columbus, Ohio, and died of severe head, neck and chest injuries.

An attorney for the patrolman said the discrimination allegations are ludicrous and that the officers gave Juarez-Popoca 'a major break' by letting him go, especially considering that his legal status in the country was in question.

Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing the Ohio state patrolman named in the lawsuit, said that Juarez-Popoca's death was a tragedy but that authorities were not discriminating against him.

'There's no discrimination here,' he said. 'If you ask me, it could just as easily be said that deputies were giving him a major break by not taking him to jail, maybe in order to not have discriminatory actions taken against him, vis-a-vis deportation.

'As an observer trying to be independent, I would suggest that's way more plausible than that they were discriminating against him because he's Hispanic.'

Two deputies, Christopher Hughes and Derek Beggs, were fired over the matter. Patrolman Sean Carpenter also was fired but won an appeal of that decision and was reinstated.
