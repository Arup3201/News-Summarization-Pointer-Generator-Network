The limo is booked, the dream dress bought and a lavish reception planned, and for Hampshire council worker Sam Young, 47, her wedding day simply can't come soon enough.

But although the fairytale nuptials are planned, paid for and ready to enjoy, one special guest won't be there: the groom.

Despite not actually being engaged - or even having a boyfriend - wedding mad Sam has decided to go ahead with her dream wedding regardless.

Big day: Council worker Sam Young is having a wedding this April, despite not actually having a groom

Dress: Sam already has a wedding dress and has asked little Ashleigh Buckland (right) to be her bridesmaid

But she's not entirely resigned to going without a groom, so Basingstoke resident Sam has taken to Facebook in an attempt to find a man willing to walk down the aisle with her, although as she's keen to point out, the lucky man won't have to actually marry her.

The post on the social networking site reads: 'Bridegroom needed for fake wedding reception. Intrigued? Read on. I want a wedding reception without actually having to get married.

'Yes I’m nuts!! Your duties will be the first dance then to have a good time. You can bring your (best man). If interested please PM me.

'No idiots or divs please. I know this sounds nuts but it’s a genuine party.

'You MUST be single cos not wanting to cause any friction, and preferably over 5ft 9 and must be between the age of 40-50.

'Literate and sense of humour a must. PM me for date of event and more info.'

Planning: Sam has organised her dream reception, complete with DJ and food for 70 guests

Fresh start: Sam, who has been married before, says the wedding is a reward for losing lots of weight

The lucky groom will enjoy a lavish reception, complete with food for 70 guests, music provided by a local DJ and the attentions of Sam's bridesmaids.

Wacky though it sounds, Sam, who even has an engagement ring, cannot wait for her big day to arrive.

Sam, who was shopping with her sister when the idea hit her, said: 'I’ve been single for a long time and I’m happily single, but I thought "Why can’t I do this?"'

'My sister and I went shopping and I was looking at all these glamorous wedding and engagement rings.

'She said ‘You need a bloke first’ and I thought "No I don’t!" So I bought the ring - if I find a man, he can reimburse me!'

Hunt: Single Sam has hit Facebook in search of the perfect man to walk down the aisle with on her big day

Support: Sam's family are happy for the wedding to go ahead, although admitted to being nonplussed at first

Sam, who works for adults services at Hampshire County Council, got married when she was 21 but was eight months pregnant and didn’t have the money for a lavish reception.

She was divorced in 1995 and lives with her sons Scott, 24, and Callan, 23, who are part of the world-famous free running group 3Run.

She’s been off work with gallstones and labyrinthitis and says she also wants to cheer up her family with the fake wedding because her grandmother Irene Armer, 87, has pancreatic cancer.

She’s already received several 'applications' and plans to draw up a short-list of potential grooms for the fake wedding in April.

She’s booked Brighton Hill Community Centre in Basingstoke for the bash and has sent out the invitations.

Her mum Sheila, 64, is backing her, saying 'I thought "That’s Sam". I got into the swing of it and thought "Why not?".'
