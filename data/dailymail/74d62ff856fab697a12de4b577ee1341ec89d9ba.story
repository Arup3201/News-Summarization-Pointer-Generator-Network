A dog shelter has been forced to hand a dog abandoned at Glastonbury festival back to its owners after animal rescue workers said they had 'no other option'.

A female lurcher, nicknamed Dolly after country singer Dolly Parton offered to adopt her, was found cowering among 5,000 abandoned tents on the 900-acre festival site at Worthy Farm in Somerset.

At the time shelter workers expressed disbelief and anger at how anyone could mistreat an animal so badly, but now, despite seeking legal advice, rescue workers have been forced to hand the pet back after her foreign owners came forward to collect her.

Dolly the lurcher was found abandoned in a tent after Glastonbury festival but has been handed back to her owners after foreign couple came forward

The RSPCA said it had sought legal advice before giving the animal back, but said it had been left with 'no other option' after the owners came forward

The dog, renamed Dolly after Glastonbury act Dolly Parton offered to adopt her, was found cowering in one of the 5,000 abandoned tents after the festival finished

After being left behind at the festival site, she was cared for by Happy Landings 
animal shelter in Pylle, Somerset, who are still unsure how the dog 
ended up being forgotten.

A spokesperson for the shelter said: 'Although we have concerns and unanswered questions legally we have had to hand her back.

'The
 RSPCA followed all avenues possible within their legal constraints. 
Dolly was delighted to see her owner and vice versa. There have been 
tears all round.

'We have 
passed on all medication and the owner will have a programme of care to 
uphold that was started here with us, which will be monitored.

'We
 would like to thank everyone for their support and donations which has 
enabled us to treat Dolly whilst she has been here without having to 
financially take away from any of the rescues in our care.

'We
 understand people’s disappointment with this outcome, we did seek legal
 advice from different sources but had no other option'

In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, country singer Dolly Parton said the dog had been reunited with her owners who had reported her missing, but were hampered by the language barrier

Crowded: For five days the festival site was home to some 175,000 people. Tractors carrying magnetic strips were dispatched to pick up tent pegs left at the festival site after it finished

Recovery: Dolly, pictured with a rescue worker, was being looked after at Happy Landings animal shelter. Staff are still not sure how Dolly came to be at the festival, as it has a no pets policy

It is unknown how the dog was able to enter the festival, which has a no pets policy.

It is thought that Dolly’s owners are from a foreign country but were able to track their pet down after reporting her missing.

Last week Dolly Parton offered to rehome the dog if they were unable to track down the real owners.

However, Rolling Stone have now reported that Dolly the dog had been reunited with her owners.

Ms
 Parton said: 'We got a call that the true owners did come forward. They
 had reported the dog missing but there was a language barrier.

'I
 think they were from another country. They got the dog back, everybody 
feels good about it. The Happy Landings shelter has a happy ending now.'
