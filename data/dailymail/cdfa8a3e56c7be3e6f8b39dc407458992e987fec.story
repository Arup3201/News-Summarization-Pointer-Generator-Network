Fancy joining the mile-high club? Now you can make your intentions clear without leaving your seat - even when the 'fasten seatbelt sign is on'.

A new Virgin gimmick lets you buy your fellow passenger a drink via the seat-back entertainment system, allowing for full-on in-flight flirting.

The America service lets flyers locate the object of their affection via a digital seat map, then send them a tipple at the touch of a button.

Cheers! Virgin passengers can locate the object of their affections via a digital seat map in the seat-back system in front of them

Target the object of your affection: Tycoon Sir Richard Branson has released a 'guide to getting lucky' by using the system

Flyers first locate 
the object of their affection via a digital seat map.

They then select what they want to send, be it drinks, snacks or even a meal, and enter their credit card details.

Staff then deliver the food to the appropriate seat.

Customers can then follow up their gift via a seat to seat chat system

After selecting items and paying with a credit card, a flight attendant delivers the goodies directly to the passenger's seat.

They can even follow up the gesture with a chat-up line sent through the seat-to-seat messaging system.

Passengers can also have meals and snacks delivered to people sitting elsewhere on the aircraft - so if things go well an admirer could end up buying you dinner.

After the delivery, you can follow up and chat with your object of affection with Virgin America's existing seat-to-seat chat platform via its Red in-flight entertainment system.

The chat platform allows travelers to send text messages to other fliers.

Billionaire Virgin boss Richard Branson 
unveiled the new service to the in-flight entertainment system with a 
video entitled: 'Sir Richard Branson's Guide to Getting Lucky at 35,000 
feet'.

'I'm not a betting man, but I say your chance of deplaning with a plus-one are at least 50 percent,' he told potential customers.

The tycoon uses the tongue-in-cheek video message to advise his passengers to 'pinpoint the object of your affections', then woo them by sending them a drink or striking up a seat-to-seat chat.

In is the latest in a series of stunts the Virgin boss has used to gain publicity for his ventures, from flashing his underwear to abseiling down buildings.

Branson, who signs off by saying 
'best of luck up there', launched the new feature to mark the start of 
Virgin's new Los Angeles to Las Vegas service.

It is available on all of the airline's U.S. flights.
