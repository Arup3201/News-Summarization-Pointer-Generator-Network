Arts, charities and indigenous education will be bolstered by a $200 million grant from the Packer family and Crown Resorts.

Gretel Packer says she and billionaire brother James learnt a lot about philanthropy from their parents, the late media tycoon Kerry Packer, and mother Roslyn.

The National Philanthropic Fund, is a ten-year commitment by the Crown Resorts Foundation and the Packer Family Foundation.

James Packer said the $200 million philanthropic fund will support people from disadvantaged backgrounds

Gretel Packer, James' sister, said both her and her brother were always interested in starting a philanthropic fund

Ms Packer, who is the Packer Family Foundation chair, said it will 'contribute towards strengthening communities in Australia and developing our artistic future'.

Crown Resorts chairman James Packer says the fund will support opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The pair has set up a $200 million National Philanthropic Fund to follow the example of their late father, media tycoon Kerry Packer, and mother Roslyn.

'Philanthropy has always been part of our family life, sometimes private, sometimes public, but always there,' Gretel Packer said at the fund's launch on Tuesday, where she was joined by her mother and daughter Francesca.

'My parents have been wonderful role models for James and I in that regard, and in so many other ways, and we appreciate their example so much.

'We have always intended to make a large philanthropic commitment, and today we are in the position to fulfil that promise.'

The $200 million is a 10-year commitment from the Packer family and casino group Crown Resorts, which will be split between arts organisations and charities.

'Today's announcement commits us to another decade of financial support for organisations which work tirelessly to deliver services, assistance and opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds," Crown Resorts chairman James Packer said in a statement.

The Salvation Army, National Centre of Indigenous Excellence and the Exodus and Father Bob Maguire foundations stand to benefit, while the Melbourne Theatre Company was one of the first arts organisations named a beneficiary, receiving $2.5 million over the next five years.

Kerry and Roslyn Packer were 'wonderful role' models to their two children, Gretel Packer said
