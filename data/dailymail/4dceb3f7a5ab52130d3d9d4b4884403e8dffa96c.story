It is known as El Caminito del Rey (the King's little pathway) and was a popular challenge for adventurers until five people lost their lives while taking on the path between 1999 and 2000.

But 14 years after it was closed due to safety fears, the famous walkway - known as the most dangerous in the world - is set to reopen to the public.

The narrow gorge in the province of Malaga, El Caminito del Rey is a precarious walkway that rises over 100 metres (328ft) above the river below.

The original trail was built to provide construction workers with access to hydroelectric power plants in Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls

The pathway has been reinforced with an extra security fence and  is now entirely safe for the public to use

The trail was built to provide construction workers with access to hydroelectric power plants in Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls between 1901 and 1905.

And it earned its royal name after it was crossed by King Alfonso XIII, who went to attend the opening ceremony of the dam Conde del Guadalhorce in 1921.

But after five people lost their lives negotiating the pathway between 1999 and 2000, the authorities were forced to close it in 2001.

After that the walkway fell into disrepair and people were ordered to stay clear of it with a €6,000 maximum fine for trespassers the deterrent.

The pathway was shut in 2001 after five people lost their lives while negotiating it between 1999 and 2000

The walkers can be seen wearing hardhats as they make their way across the newly renovated trail

However, after an extensive €2.8 million restoration it was recently reopened to the press and will officially open to the public on March 28.

A joint effort by the regional government of Andalusia and the local government of Malaga, who shared the costs of the renovation, the project has retained much of the walkway’s original features.

The pathway has also been reinforced with an extra security fence and despite offering up some dizzying views is entirely safe.

The €2.8 million restoration cost was split between the regional government of Andalusia and the local government of Malaga

King Felipe is said to be among the first guests preparing to negotiaite the rennovated path

In the video walkers can be seen wearing hard hats as they clutch the newly installed handrails on their way along the trail.

A cave is also incorporated into the path, and walkers can be seen entering and exiting it via a set of stairs.

The walk will be free to enjoy for the first six months  before a small fee is brought in thereafter.

King Felipe is due to be among the first guests to take a walk along the renovated path.

Tickets for the dangerous walk will initially be free for the first six months before a small fee is brought in
