Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has former driver Sebastian Vettel to thank for their 'camouflage car' in testing this week.

The black-and-white livery design is visually refractive, ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car's aerodynamics.

Horner has conceded the idea was spawned by Vettel's helmet design seen over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend last year.

Although four-times champion Vettel has moved on to Ferrari, Horner said: 'Seb's helmet was quite fun, so we thought it would be interesting to extend that concept to the rest of the car.

'Dietrich (Mateschitz, owner) liked it when he saw it, and it epitomises Red Bull that we like to do things a bit differently.

'To see a Red Bull in a different livery is striking and it makes it difficult to get detailed photographs of the car, as it confuses the eyeline, at a time of year when we're all trying to be as secretive as we possibly can.

'But it's obviously had a great reaction.

Horner admitted the car is likely to return to its traditional colours for the first race of the but will feature a stronger livery design

'It's been extremely well received.'

Fans, in particular, are keen for Red Bull to run the livery over the course of the season.

Horner has conceded that will not be the case, he added: 'The fans won't be disappointed because the livery will be even stronger.'

There was little sign, however, of the car in action on the morning of the second day of the test at the Circuito de Jerez.

That was due to the fact new recruit Daniil Kvyat, promoted from Toro Rosso to fill Vettel's shoes, damaged the one-and-only front-wing available to the team on an early installation lap.

Despite lacking a spare, Kvyat still ran on track without a wing for a handful of laps before deciding to pit and wait for the new part to arrive from the factory in Milton Keynes.

Horner said: 'Unfortunately Daniil very lightly touched the tyre wall with the front wing, causing damage.

'It's the only front-wing assembly we have in Jerez at the moment, which is relatively usual for this time of year when you are not abundant with spare parts.

'There are more components coming down later today, this evening and over the next two days. We'll certainly have a new front wing by tomorrow morning.'
