His creepy clown costune has delighted and terrified Northampton since he was first spotted roaming the streets on Friday the 13th.

But now the mysterious joker behind the Northampton Clown has been unmasked.

Film and documentary maker Alex Powell finally admitted this weekend that he is the prankster after he was pictured coming out of a house dressed in the sinister costume.

The Northampton Clown has been a mystery since appearing on the streets on Friday September 13

The 22-year-old student has built up an international following since he was first pictured last month.

More than 184,000 people have liked his page on the Spot Northampton's Clown Facebook and his story has been featured on news channels across the world.

He was outed by the Sunday People, who took pictures of him and his accomplices Elliot Simpson and Luke Ubanski, who runs the page on Facebook.

The trio were seen going into a house in their normal clothes before Powell emerged in his clown costume.

When he was challenged by a newspaper reporter he said: 'OK, I am the clown but I’ve been trying to keep it as ­mysterious as possible. To be discreet so people didn’t find out.'

The Northampton University student said not everyone has seen the funny side of his antics and he has even been sent more than 1,000 death threats on Facebook. 

The student says he has received hundreds of death threats on Facebook for his clown antics

He told the Sunday People: 'It was just a bit of fun at first and a lot of people seem to enjoy it but it gets a bit hard sometimes with the death threats.'

He said he was at a local football match when a spectator threatened him with a knife.

The student has also been phoned and told he would be run over.

The Northampton Clown first emerged on the streets of Northampton on Friday September 13.

His scary costume closely resembles that of Pennywise, the clown in the film adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel It.

He would comment on pictures of him uploaded to Facebook and sign off with Pennywise's catchphrase, 'beep, beep'.

The clown would also tease fans with clues on the page about where he would appear next.

After rumours that he was carrying a knife, the clown told a local newspaper anonymously: 'I just wanted to amuse people.

'Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards.

'It's like watching a horror movie. When people get scared they usually start laughing.'

Despite some hostile reaction, Powell said he just wanted to entertain people.

Last weekend, he visited a terminally ill girl in costume and also plans to donate money raised from merchandise to charity.
