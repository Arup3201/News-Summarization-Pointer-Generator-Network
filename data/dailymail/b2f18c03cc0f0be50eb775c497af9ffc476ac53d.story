Egyptian army officers were seen constructing the third line of the hastily erected barricades around the presidential palace of leader Mohammed Morsi today.

The security measures followed threats of protests against President's Morsi's decision not to delay the referendum on his controversial draft constitution, set to be held next Saturday.

Hundreds of Egyptians today marched on the presidential palace and the newly build barricades, despite Morsi rescinded a decree that would stop the judiciary challenging his rule.

His decision to renounce his planned 
'Pharaoh' powers was a desperate bid to end the violence in which at 
least seven have died and hundreds have been injured.

Liberal and secular opponents say the 
framework of the draft constitution is too deeply influenced by Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood party.

The ratification of the constitution would seal the democratic transition that began when the country's 2011 uprising saw dictator Hosni Mubarak ousted after three decades of one-man rule.

National
Salvation Front leader Ahmed Said called the race to a referendum an 
‘act of war’. His  movement called for a mass protest at the palace in 
Cairo. The building was stormed last week by activists angered by the 
power grab.

The concrete wall is the third 
barrier built outside the presidential palace and as hundreds marched on
the palace today Morsi's worried proved not to be unfounded.

However, Mori's choice to lift the 
decree last night could persuade many judges to drop their two-week 
strike to protest against it, which means they would oversee the 
referendum as is customary in Egypt.

It was the decrees that initially 
sparked the wave of protests against Morsi that has brought tens of 
thousands into the streets in past weeks.

However, the rushed passage of the 
constitution further inflamed those who claim Morsi and his Islamist 
allies are monopolizing power in 
Egypt and trying to force their agenda.

The draft charter was adopted amid a boycott by liberal and Christian 
members of the Constituent Assembly, meaning not all members voted.

The document would open the door to
Egypt's most extensive implementation of Islamic law or Shariah, 
enshrining a say for Muslim clerics in legislation, making civil rights 
subordinate to Shariah and broadly allowing the state to protect 'ethics
and morals'.

It fails to outlaw gender discrimination and mainly refers
to women in relation to home and family.

In his late night announcement on Saturday, Morsi
replaced the scrapped decrees with a new one that doesn't give him 
unrestricted powers, but allows him to give voters an option if they 
decide to vote "no" on the disputed draft charter.

In the new decree, if the 
constitution is rejected, Morsi would call for new elections to select 
100-member panel to write a new charter within three months.

The new panel would then have up to six months to complete its task, and the president calls for a new referendum with a month. 

Bassem Sabry, a writer and activist, 
called the partial concession a 'stunt' that would embarrass the 
opposition by making it look like Morsi was willing to compromise but 
not solve the problem.

'In the end, Morsi got everything he 
wanted,' he said, pointing out the referendum would be held without the 
consensus Morsi had promised to seek and without giving people 
sufficient time to study the document.

Yesterday Morsi was warned by the 
powerful Egyptian army that ‘anything other than dialogue will force us 
into a dark tunnel with disastrous consequences.’

The statement, broadcast on Egyptian 
state TV was attributed to an anonymous official who promised the 
military would not allow this to happen.

Good idea: The building works may have been justified as it was reported that several hundreds of Egyptians marched on the palace to protest against the vote on the draft constitution next Saturday
