Barack Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro today, an unprecedented gesture of friendship which occurred, fittingly, at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela – but left the U.S. president facing backlash that he had warmly greeted a 'murderer'.

The handshake between leaders of the two Cold War enemies took place during a ceremony which honored the former South African President's powerful legacy of reconciliation.

But members of the U.S. Congress were upset on Tuesday, led by Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and son of Cuban immigrants.

'If
 the president was going to shake his hand, Rubio told MailOnline, 'he should have asked him 
about those basic freedoms Mandela was associated with that are denied 
in Cuba.'

Rubio has
 been an outspoken critic of the Castro regime which he said earlier this year 'sponsors 
terrorism abroad and against their own people.'

'It is nauseating, Florida GOP congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told Fox News.

'I was born in Cuba, had to leave the homeland because of oppression... He shook the hand of a murderer, of a thug. And those are bloodied hands.

'If it's just a handshake that's not going to produce any change, I think Raul Castro should have listened to what Obama said' about human rights, she insisted.

The gesture seemed to show another small step toward rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, raising hopes the two nations could be
 on the verge of a breakthrough in relations.

But Ros-Lehtinen, who represents thousands of Cuban refugees who are now U.S. citizens, was so upset that she laid into Secretary of State John Kerry during an unrelated hearing about Iran.

'When the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of
a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the
tyrant,' she lectured him before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

'Raul Castro uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail
Democracy advocates. In fact, right now as we speak Cuban opposition leaders
are being detained and they're being beaten while trying to commemorate today,
which is International Human Rights Day.'

Kerry deflected the criticism.

'Today is about honoring Nelson Mandela. And the
president is at an international funeral ... he didn't choose who's there,' he said.

Ros-Lehtinen asked if Castro is honoring the human rights of
Cubans.

'No, absolutely not,' Kerry replied.

Former
 president Jimmy Carter, who was part of the U.S. delegation to attend 
Mandela's memorial, said that the handshake was 'significant', adding: 
'I hope that will be an omen for the future.'

The handshake between Obama and the brother who took over the duties of 
longtime Cuban dictator Fidel Castro was seen by millions around the 
world on live television. A White House official said it was not 'pre-planned'.

The Cuban government hailed it as a 
hopeful sign, writing on its website: 'May this... be the beginning of 
the end of the US aggressions.'

Obama
 later used his eulogy to Mandela, a man he considers a personal hero, 
to address dictators of the world who pay lip service 
to Mandela's legacy while repressing their own people.

He said: 'There 
are too many of us who happily embrace Madiba's legacy of racial 
reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would 
challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality.

'There
 are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for 
freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there 
are too many of us who stand on the sidelines, comfortable in 
complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.'

A group of U.S. lawmakers visited with Castro in February, in a failed 
bid to secure the release of U.S. government contractor Alan Gross, who 
has been imprisoned there since December 2009.

Gross was sentenced to 15
 years in prison for installing Internet networks as part of a secretive
 U.S. program that aids dissidents in connecting with the outside world.

 Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy led the delegation, which also included 
Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona; Democratic Senators Debbie 
Stabenow of Michigan, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse of 
Rhode Island; and Democratic Representatives Jim McGovern of 
Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.

The
 Obama administration has made Gross’ release a condition of any future 
thaw in America’s icy relationship with Havana. Under the 1996 
'Helms-Burton' law, U.S. trade sanctions with Cuba cannot be lifted 
until the nation’s one-party Communist political system gives way to 
another form of government.

At Tuesday's memorial service, Obama greeted a long line of world 
leaders and heads of state attending the memorial service in 
Johannesburg after flying to South Africa with a U.S. delegation which 
included former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Jimmy Carter 
along with their families.

Obama also shook hands with Brazilian 
President Dilma Rousseff, who has clashed with the U.S. President over 
alleged National Security Agency spying.

Thorning Schmidt.

Obama arrived an hour late to the memorial service on Tuesday after missing the 
opening speeches when his motorcade got stuck in traffic. The
 President was greeted with a rapturous ovation when he arrived at the FNB Stadium to pay tribute to the former South 
African leader.

Obama described Mr Mandela as the 
'last great liberator of the 20th century' and compared him to Ghandi 
and Martin Luther King in a powerful address to the crowds.

Obama opened his speech by thanking
 Mandela's family, then continued: 'To the people of South Africa - 
people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing
 Nelson Mandela with us.

'Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.

'Mandela taught us the power of action, but also ideas; the 
importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those you
 agree with, but those who you don't.'

Referring
 to the anti-apartheid icon's friendship with his own prison warders, 
the President said: 'It took a man like Madiba to free not just the 
prisoner, but the gaoler as well.'

To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph.

Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by elders of his Thembu tribe - Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century.

He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood - a son and husband, a father and a friend.

Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals.

Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa - 'Ubuntu' - that describes his greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.

It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the gaoler as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth. He changed laws, but also hearts.

There are too many of us who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us who stand on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.

We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa, and young people around the world - you can make his life’s work your own.

Over thirty years ago, while still a student, I learned of Mandela and the struggles in this land. It stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities - to others, and to myself - and set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be better.
