This group of female horse riders are stripping off to raise funds for a good cause.

Each one is involved in the equestrian world in some capacity; either hunting, show jumping, or into eventing or dressage. 

And the one-time models, who each represent a different month, have dressed up in lingerie for a racy horsey-themed calendar.

They've accessorised themselves with little other than strategically-placed riding props such as whips, caps and riding jackets. 

The women from the equestrian scene in Wiltshire, Somerset and Devon are all amateurs, and for most is the first time in front of a camera.

The Foxy Hunters calender 2015, now in its sixth year, features black and white shots of the women and raises money for air ambulance services.

One model, Laura Quick 31, of Honiton, Devon, competes in dressage and show jumping.

She said: 'We certainly have a giggle during the shoots. Fun aside though the cause for the calendar is the real reason we all participate.'

The Foxy Hunters Calendar was conceived by Photographer David Betteridge of DHB Photography in 2009.

Having photographed many equestrian events he became aware of the dangerous nature of the sport.

The idea is to raise funds for the Wiltshire Air Ambulance, and the Hampshire and IOW Air Ambulance, which play such a vital role for local horse riders.

When a friend's life was saved by the Hampshire and IOW Air Ambulance Crew following a riding accident the project became even more important and very personal and so it was decided that the funds raised also go to help their amazing work. 

Mr Betteridge said: 'My market is primarily online - I have orders from all around the world, we send them to New Zealand, to Australia and a lot to America and Canada.

'We have people that come through the Facebook group and offer to be in it, and they come from around the country, but most of the women in it are still locals from Wiltshire.'

Last year he had to double the amount of calendars he printed. 

'It started with just a couple of hundred likes on Facebook and now it has just rocketed - I often think I must be dreaming.' 

To date more than £26,000 has been raised to help keep the Air Ambulance Services flying.

The calendar is available via the website foxyhunters.co.uk priced at £12.50 plus postage and packing.
