A female teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with her 17-year-old student after she was dobbed in by her husband.

The 44-year-old woman was arrested at her home in St Marys, in Sydney's west, on Tuesday and was taken to Penrith Police Station.

It is understood the woman's husband found out about her alleged sexual relationship with the male teenager and reported his wife to police, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Police also searched the Year 11 student's home and took a number of items.

The 44-year-old was charged with four counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 16 and 18 under special care.

The woman was granted conditional bail to appear at Penrith Local Court on Monday 19 January 2015.

She has been suspended from her role as teacher at a Western Sydney high school.

A NSW Education spokesman said the Department has removed the teacher from the school.

'She will be placed on alternative duties away from all students,' he said.

'Counselling has been offered to the student involved.

'As the matter is before the courts, it is not appropriate to comment further at this time.'

The NSW Department of Education and Communities code of conduct states teachers cannot have sexual relationships with students, consensual or otherwise.

'It is irrelevant whether the relationship is homosexual or heterosexual, consensual or non-consensual or condoned by parents or caregivers,' it states.

'The age of the students or staff member involved is also irrelevant.'
