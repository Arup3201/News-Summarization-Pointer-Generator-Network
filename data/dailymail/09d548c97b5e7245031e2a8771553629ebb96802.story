A controversial plan to segregate all people wearing face coverings inside Parliament House has been dumped.

The security overhaul, which one MP labelled 'religious apartheid', was abandoned after mounting criticism.

However, the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) which sets security protocols says all visitors to Parliament House will now be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features.

A controversial plan to segregate people wearing face coverings in Parliament House has been dumped in favour of new security measures

Anyone wearing a facial covering is now required to remove it at Parliament House check points for identificatoin purposes before being allowed to view Question Time proceedings from the public gallery

Bronwyn Bishop is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The decision taken by the Speaker and Senate President Stephen Parry to restrict anyone wearing facial coverings to a glassed-in area of Parliament has now been rescinded and replaced with new rules

Senate president Stephen Parry was asked to reconsider the 'burqa ban' by Prime Minister Abbott. That security measure has now been rescinded in favour of new rules

The DPS says this will enable security staff to identify anyone who may have been previously banned from entering the building or who may be known to be a security risk.

'Once this process has taken place visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place.'

The new security arrangements reverse a decision announced on October 2 to seat people wearing coverings such as a burqa in glassed-off areas, normally reserved for noisy school children.

That decision - made by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry - came after more than week of heated debate about the potential security risk posed by burqas.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who labelled the burqa as 'confronting', intervened in the matter, requesting a review of the decision after it prompted widespread outrage.

But Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek ridiculed Mr Abbott's comments regarding the burqa being confronting.

'I'd prefer if Tony Abbott didn't get about in his Speedos either, but it's a free country,' she said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott calls the burqa 'confronting' but asked the Speaker of the House, Bronwyn Bishop and the Senate President, to reconsider the ban inside parts of Parliament House

The DPS says the security measures for Parliament House have now been 'enhanced'.

Procedures are in place to ensure that security manage the arrangements in a 'sensitive and appropriate manner'.

The official circular from the DPS states that the new rules are effective immediately:

'Further to the circular of 2 October 2014 providing for interim access arrangements to the private areas and public galleries at Parliament House, the Presiding Officers met yesterday and enhanced those arrangements. This circular replaces the circular of 2 October with effect from 8.30am Monday 20 October 2014.

'The new interim arrangements are as follows:

(a) The renewal and issue of sponsored passes remains suspended.

(b) Photographic identification is required for the issue of escorted passes for all adult visitors.

(c) All visitors entering Parliament House will be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features. This will enable DPS security staff to identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk. Once this process has taken place, visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place.

New procedures have come into force on Monday at Parliament House in Canberra requiring anyone wearing a facial covering like a burqa to remove it temporarily for identification before being allowed in

'Procedures are still in place to ensure that DPS security manage these procedures in a sensitive and appropriate manner.

'These measures are designed to enhance and strengthen the existing access, identification and security arrangements at Parliament House. Further amendments and enhancements to pass policy and broader security practice will be implemented in due course.'

Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek and Palmer United Party Senate Jacqui Lambie hold distinctly opposite views when it comes to the wearing of the burqa

The government was accused of inflaming tensions with the Muslim community when it was revealed the proposed restrictions, which would have forced women wearing head
coverings to view chambers of parliament from the glassed-in
gallery, following a series of high-profile security-related raids across Sydney and Brisbane.

'I asked the Speaker to re-think that decision and my
understanding is that it was an interim decision,' Mr Abbott said at the time.

Mr Abbott said the burqa was something he
wished people chose not to wear, but said it was not the role of
government to tell people what to wear outside of secure
buildings.

The restrictions were criticised by Muslim groups and
opposition members of parliament, including independent MP
Andrew Wilkie, who called them a form of 'religious apartheid'.

Among those who had thrown their weight behind a proposed ban was controversial Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie who labelled it a 'national security issue'.

'It is like a motorbike helmet. It is like a balaclava,' she said during the debate

'I will not allow you to wear that into my office because it is a security risk.'
