Chelsea could have been awarded a penalty in the first half of their Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.

There were two separate incidents in the area as Chris Smalling appeared to wrestle Branislav Ivanovic to the ground as Marcos Rojo similarly seemed to hold John Terry.

Sportsmail's GRAHAM POLL gives his verdict of Phil Dowd's handling of the incident.

You could argue it should be two penalties. It’s not just Chris Smalling on Ivanovic, you’ve got Rojo on Terry. The two have virtually got them in headlocks. 

From Dowd’s position he should see this. You can tell by Ivanovic’s reaction; he’s not just appealing — he’s going berserk. The Manchester United ones are worse than Shawcross (versus Swansea) last week.

Phil Dowd let Chelsea down by ignoring two headlocks by Manchester United defenders at the same setpiece and by doing so also let his select list colleague Michael Oliver down.

Oliver was the referee who correctly awarded Swansea a penalty when Ryan Shawcross held Wilfried Bony and Dowd had the chance to reinforce referees resolve to stop this practise by awarding Chelsea the penalty they deserved for either Marcos Rojo’s hold on John Terry or Chris Smalling’s even more blatant hold on Branislav Ivanovic.

Dowd chose to stick to his belief that you are remembered for what you give and not what you miss or ignore and that was a major disappointment to all neutrals who are fed up with this continual holding at set pieces.
