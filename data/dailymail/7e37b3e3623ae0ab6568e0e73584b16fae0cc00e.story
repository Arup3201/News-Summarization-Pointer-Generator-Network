Taylor Swift has been a star since the age of 16, when she released her first album and it went to No.5 in the US Billboard Chart. 

The singer has gone on to release four more albums, which have all gone to to the top spot in America .  

But it wasn't until last year that the 25 year old from Pennsylvania went on to become a global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele.

Taylor Swift may not have attended the Golden Globes but she made her presence known at the InStyle magazine after party in this vibrant yellow gown by Jenny Packham.

There are many ways to make an entrance at a big event. You can go for the thigh split or the plunging neckline look. Or you'll be sure to turn heads with a 'novelty' dress a la Bjork or Lady Gaga. But the safest way to make an impact is with the use of bold color.

Taylor clearly got the memo and was the picture of sunshine elegance in this lovely bandeau dress. Jenny Packham is a classic red carpet choice. Her designs are beloved of the Duchess of Cambridge as well as stars including Kate Beckinsale and Kate Winslet and they suit Taylor's girly style to a tee.

Taylor's influence is now mind blowing - she has 52.8 million Twitter followers and 74.4 million likes on Facebook. 

Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. 

The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. 

Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton.

Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. 

It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. 

In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. 

There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles.

But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life.  

She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.'

'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' 

In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. 

The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age.

But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. 

Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. 

Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. 

For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss.

Every morning, she leaves her Manhattan loft dressed in an immaculate ensemble that puts most celebrities to shame. 

Stick her name into Google and it is virtually impossible to find a snap of Taylor with a hair out of place. 

And while her schedule has become even more demanding, she hasn't failed to forget the people who helped her to make it in the first place.

Her feelings of responsibility towards her fans is one of the strongest in showbiz - she researches their hobbies on social media and then buys presents for them that reflect their personalities. 

According to the Telegraph, she has even been known to help pay off her supporters' student loans. 

She said: 'Do they like photography? I'll get them an 1980s Polaroid camera. Do they like vintage stuff? I'll go to an antiques place and get them 1920s earrings. Do they work out a lot? I'll get them workout stuff. 

'When you actually get to know them on a person-by-person basis, you realise what you're doing is special and sacred and it matters.' 

With an attitude like that, her popularity is unlikely to fade anytime soon.
