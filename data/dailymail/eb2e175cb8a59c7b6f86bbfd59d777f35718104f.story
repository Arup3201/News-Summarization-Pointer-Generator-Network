Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer says the club's owners do not wish to lose striker Jordan Rhodes.

The 25-year-old has been the subject of an offer from Middlesbrough while Nottingham Forest, Derby, Norwich and Sheffield Wednesday have also expressed interest.

Rhodes scored Blackburn's last minute winner against Bolton on Wednesday night and Bowyer says Rovers owners Venky’s share his stance on not letting the Scotland international leave on loan to a rival Championship club.

Bowyer said: 'They (Venky's) are of the same opinion as ourselves – why would we want to be doing that?'

Boro manager Aitor Karanka asked if he could confirm Boro’s approach, said: 'I don’t need to speak about speculation because we have a lot of games in front of us that are very important.

'Jordan Rhodes is not our player so I prefer to speak about our players.' Pushed again he said: 'If, if, if. We could bring in Ronaldo and Messi, (that) could be good for everybody.'

Forest manager Dougie Freedman admitted his side have given up hope of signing Rhodes.

Freedman told BBC Radio Nottingham: 'I phoned Gary Bowyer and he was very open and honest with me saying Jordan was not going out on loan so that was the end of the conversation.

'There was a rumour in the game that he could be going out on loan and I’m a big admirer of Jordan so out of respect I phoned Gary.

'I spoke to him and said if that was to come up we’d be interested in loaning Jordan with a view to a permanent if we did go up and he just squashed it straight away.'
