Meet the python on a murderous cane toad rampage.

The snake was spotted wrapping itself around the neck of a cane toad in the car park of Darwin's Sky City Casino this week.

It's believed to have killed at least another two in as many days.

'When I first looked I had a thought that someone had got a cane toad and put on some Christmas decorations,' Jason Carpenter, who snapped the photo, told the NT News.

'Then I realised it was a cane toad with a python wrapped round it. It was a negative outcome for the toad.'

The snake, nicknamed 'The Assassinator', doesn't stick around to eat the cane toads and instead just leaves their bloated bodies in the casino car park, which is how Mr Carpenter stumbled across it.

He joked that the snake should train up his friends to help round up and kill more cane toads to stop the pest destroying native species and the environment. 

It comes following revelations freshwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory had worked out ways to eat cane toads without being poisoned by just chewing off the legs.

Crocodile specialist Dr Adam Britton told Daily Mail Australia last week that he and his wife had discovered a significant amount of toxic cane toads with missing legs in rivers 500 kilometres from Darwin. 

'My wife Erin did some surveys in 2009 after the cane toads reached the areas. She observed the twisted and mangled toads and noticed the crocodile teeth marks,' Mr Britton said.

'We know that they often like to flick and tear off whatever they're holding in their mouth and that's what we're seeing a lot around the area.

'We were sceptical at first but now we've seen patterns and it's obvious that they're mangling the back legs to feed themselves.'

The poisonous cane toads have the power to effect the crocodile population, according to Mr Britton.

‘The toads have toxins in parts of their body that will usually kill the crocodiles when they consume them,’ he said.

'The ones who have been tearing of their legs from its limbs are the ones who have survived.'
