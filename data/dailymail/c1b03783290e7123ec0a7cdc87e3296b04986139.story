Monaco still want Arsene Wenger to return to the club, despite the Frenchman only signing a new contract with Arsenal in May

Theo Walcott is set to make his comeback after nine months out with a serious knee injury on Friday.

The Arsenal forward is due to play for the Under 21's against Blackburn having not played since suffering a knee ligament injury against Tottenham in January.

Walcott returned to full training on Monday and Friday's clash at Meadow Park is the next major step in his return to full fitness.

The England star is unlikely to feature in the Gunners' Premier League clash against Hull on Saturday, however.

He could make the bench next Wednesday for the away Champions League tie against Anderlecht.

Walcott’s imminent return will be a relief for Wenger as his injury list continues to grow.

Arsenal have recently lost Aaron Ramsey to a hamstring injury and record signing Mesut Ozil to a knee injury, which could keep him out of action until the New Year.

Meanwhile striker Olivier Giroud is still out of action since breaking his foot against Everton In August.

Wenger is also facing a defensive crisis ahead of Hull’s visit on Saturday as centre-back Laurent Koscielny is out for three weeks with an achilles injury, Mathieu Debuchy remains on the sidelines with an ankle complaint and Calum Chambers is suspended.

The Arsenal manager insists it is just a coincidence: ‘You cannot say our injuries are preparation mistakes. The big injuries we have are really accidental.

‘Scientifically we are quite good. We have been hit hard after seven games. I would never have thought we would have had so many bad injuries.

‘I am not a great believer in coincidences but this time it really is coincidence.’
