A former Disney star has been cast as Ronald Reagan in an upcoming biopic about the 40th President of the United States

David Henrie, who is best known for playing Selena Gomez's older brother on the Disney channel show Wizards Of Waverly Place, will play a young Reagan in the $25 million indie film.

Called Reagan, the film will be told from the point of view of a KGB officer who was tasked with keeping tabs on Reagan from his days as a Hollywood actor in movies such as Bedtime for Bonzo.

Henrie will play Reagan in his teens and 20s, beginning with his time as a lifeguard, college football star and through his time as a radio announcer before he moved to Hollywood.

'I'm excited to play such an iconic figure in an era of his life that many people don't know about,' said Henrie. 'That makes this role more challenging as an actor. I look forward to that challenge.'

'It's a universal film with universal values and principles,' he told The Hollywood Reporter.

'David has the physicality of a lifeguard and a very strong presence,' producer Mark Joseph said. 'He also has a strong and consistent body of work that attracted us to him.'

Henrie took to social media on Thursday to celebrate the announcement that he will play the 40th President of the United States

The film is adapted by Space Cowboy's Howard Klausner and based on two biographies by Paul Kengor. Henrie is the first cast member to be announced.

This will be the first biopic made for the silver screen about Reagan, who is still a beloved icon for millions, especially Republicans and conservatives.

Reagan started out in politics as president of the Screen Actors Guild union. 

Under the influence of the family of his second wife, actress Nancy Davis, he switched from being a Democrat to being a Republican and staunch anti-communist.

He died in 2004 at age 93 after a long decline into Alzheimer's and was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California.

This will be the first biopic made for the silver screen about Reagan, right, although Alan Rickman played him in Lee Daniels' The Butler in 2013
