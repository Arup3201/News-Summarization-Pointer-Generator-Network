Everyone's a food photographer nowadays: sometimes it feels like you can't escape from the endless stream of supper club plates and flourless chocolate cakes on Instagram and Facebook.

But now one photographer is trying to do something a little different with edible subjects.

Food and drink snapper Sarah Anne Ward is recreating famous artworks using sweets, cake, ice cream and jelly.

Ward recreated Rothko's White Center, which sold for £45.5 million in 2007, using cake, chocolate sauce and ice cream

Candy photograph pays homage to Damien 
Hirst's For The Love Of God diamond skull, with the jewels replaced by the pastel-coloured boiled sweets.

Together with food stylists Michelle Gatton and Heather Meldrom, Ward recreates Rothko's White
Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose), which sold for £45.5 
million in 2007, using cake, chocolate sauce and ice cream.

The mouthwatering photographs form part of Ward's Dessert Art project.

'Nowadays people just vomit food imagery with Instagram and Facebook,' Ward says of her motivation for shooting the series.

'I am always trying to find new ways to shoot, style, and just reimagine the food and our relationships and experiences with it.'

And so, in Ward's world, Jackson Pollock's work is recreated with Rice Krispie cakes while Mondrian's famous 1930s primary-coloured Compositions are represented using shaped jelly.

Working with food stylists Michelle Gatton and Heather Meldrom, Ward has recreated famous pieces, such as Damien Hirst's For The Love Of God diamond skull, here replicated with boiled sweets

The candy self-portrait is inspired by one of Ward's favorite artists, Cindy Sherman

Jeff Koons's giant shiny balloon dog 
is remade with Twinkies (American sponge cake with creamy filling) and 
Georges Seurat's Eiffel Tower 1889 is copied on top of a sponge cake, 
the blurry, pointilliste effect mimicked with candy sprinkles.

The candy self portrait is inspired by one of Ward’s favorite artists of all time, Cindy Sherman, and the Cubist movement features with Picasso and Braque-inspired pinwheel cookies.

Ward, from Manhattan, New York, takes playing with food to an altogether higher plane with her fascinating project.

She
specialises in food, drinks, and still-life product photography. Her 
clients include J Crew, The New York Times, Random House, Esquire, Ralph
Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger.
