An HIV-positive man has potentially infected thousands of people - by having unprotected sex so he could spread the disease.

David Dean Smith, 51, turned himself in to a Michigan police station last week - after claiming to have slept with 3,000 men and women over several years.

A detective investigating the case said: 'He says he intentionally attempted to spread the disease to kill people.

'His latest fantasy is strangling a woman and having sex with her dead body.'

Charged: David Dean Smith turned himself in for having sex with 'thousands' of women while he knew he was HIV-positive

Big black book: Smith told one of his victims he had been with up to 3,000 people

It is unclear when Smith was diagnosed with HIV, but he claims to have known full well what he was doing when he had unprotected sex with many partners over the past few years.

While he claims that there may be thousands of victims, so far he has only been arraigned and charged with two counts of AIDS-sexual penetration with an uninformed partner.

Neither of the two victims that police are aware of have been identified, but one has spoken to reporters in an effort to help other women realize if they may be infected.

She said that once she was tested, she immediately knew it was Smith who infected her. The two met through a Yahoo! Personals listing and, in speaking with MSNBC, she called him a 'sociopath' and 'a predator'.

Smith works in telecommunications - previously at Ronco Communications and now at Blue Cross Blue Shield, a healthcare provider.

Though the scope of his destructive path is still unknown, that woman said that she and Smith got together in 2008.

She claims he texted her as he was headed to the police station, saying 'Turning myself into the law, my life is over. Take care. Always love you'.

She was not fooled by the niceties, however. 'It's something he should have done years ago,' she told MSNBC. 'He shouldn't get a pat on the head for what he did.'

In her previous conversations with Smith, he lead her to believe that he had a vast sexual past, claiming that he had had sex with up to 3,000 people, including men and women.

'He hits drifters. He hits people who are young. He hits young women, and from what I understand, he hits men, too.'

Deadly strain: The HIV virus leads to AIDS, and can easily be transferred from person to person during unprotected sex if one partner is infected

According to his Facebook profile, Smith graduated from Harry Hill high school in Lansing, Michigan in 1978. He then went on to study at the online for-profit University of Pheonix.

His frequent and positive posts about the successes of his band do not reflect the supposed inner turmoil that he was going through.

He was court-appointed to a mental health facility because of recent suicide attempts, and their records allege that he is 'sexually aroused by causing pain to females.

In Michigan, sexual penetration with HIV is considered a felony and he will be tried accordingly.
