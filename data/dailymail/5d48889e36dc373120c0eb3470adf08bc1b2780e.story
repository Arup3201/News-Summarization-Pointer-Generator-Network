Holidaymakers who have always wanted to travel like an A-list celebrity are being given the chance to follow in the footsteps of David Beckham.

After the global superstar’s documentary saw him journey through the Amazon rainforest, Brits can now book to do the same tour – but in style.

Holidaysplease has launched the 13-day break, designed around seeing the best of Brazil in luxury, including checking into a lodge located deep in the heart of the Amazon.

A stay at 
the Anavilhanas Lodge has been described as ‘life changing’ and puts travellers right in the thick of the action – similar to where Beckham stayed for 
the BBC1 David Beckham Into The Unknown documentary, which aired this 
week.

Viewers saw Beckham, after arriving in Manaus, the rainforest 
city where England is set to play Italy next month - explore the surrounding area with friends Derek 
White and Dave Gardner by motorbike and boat.

Guided by locals, the star visited the community of Angelin, crossed the river Negro to the 
banks of the Cuieras River and travelled deep into the rainforest to meet
 the remote Yanomami tribe - and viewers also saw him get spooked by a tiny frog.

The
 new Holidaysplease trip – which costs £3,799 including flights – flies from the UK to Rio 
for three nights in the ‘Marvellous City’, staying at the four-star 
Porto Bay International Hotel, in the heart of Copacabana Beach.

As
 well as a jeep tour to Corcovado to see Christ the Redeemer and Tijuca Forest, there’s 
the chance to visit Sugar Loaf Mountain before heading to the Amazon 
rainforest.

Guests will fly from Rio to Manaus - the entry point for the jungle - where they will spend the night at the Tropical Hotel in Manaus before heading to Anavilhanas Lodge.

Staying deep in the heart of the jungle for three nights, holidaymakers will be exploring ‘into the unknown’ - or lazing by the resort's stunning pool.

After flying back to Manaus, guests will travel to the Pantanal, a vast expanse of wetlands, thought of as the best place to spot wild animals in the whole of South America.

Upon arrival at the airport guests will be transferred by 4x4 vehicle to the award-winning Araras Eco Lodge for three nights.

The
 wetlands are one of the most uninhabitable places in the world, and the
 lodge is situated right next to the river – the perfect place to spot 
wild animals.

The holiday ends with a final night in Rio before heading back to London.

A
 spokesman for Holidaysplease said: ‘When the most iconic celebrity in 
the world does something truly unique, it’s only natural for people to 
do the same.

‘We’ve
 created a bespoke tour that not only lets you see the heart of the 
Amazon Jungle, but also throws in some rest and relaxation.

The adventure starts and finishes on the beach – giving travellers time to relax and check their camera full of memories – and includes a half-day jeep tour to Corcovado & Tijuca Rainforest.
