A violent sex offender who fled Canada before allegedly sexually assaulting a boy in a Seattle alleyway has given a sickening 'thumbs up' in court as he was sent to prison for just two months.

Michael Sean Stanley, 48, grinned and posed for cameras as he appeared in Seattle Municipal Court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to harassing West Seattle residents and resisting arrest.

Stanley, who was previously jailed in Canada for sexually assaulting two mentally-challenged boys, was sentenced to seven months in prison but, because of time served, he will only serve two.

He has not yet been charged in relation to the alleged sexual assault, but the Kings County Prosecutor's Office told KIRO that they are continuing to investigate.

Sick: Michael Sean Stanley gives a 'thumbs up' as he is sentenced to 2 months in prison in Seattle this week

At ease: He smiled and posed for pictures three months after he was arrested for harassment and resisting arrest. He is also accused of sexually assaulting a teenage boy before he was arrested

His sentence comes after he was arrested in the early hours of October 22.

Police said Stanley had met a 16-year-old boy at a
 west Seattle grocery store, struck up a conversation with him and walked him to an alley where police say he plied the teen with alcohol.

He then grabbed the teen and sexually assaulted him, police said. The boy pulled a knife and was able to run away and contact authorities.

Detectives believe the incident 
happened before police received several calls reporting noise in an 
alley and Stanley threatening someone who asked him to be quiet.

When
 police arrived, Stanley became combative and said he had a knife. He 
appeared intoxicated, according to authorities. He was arrested and 
jailed for investigation of harassment.

'I've got to be responsible for my actions so that's why I'm agreeing with it,' Stanley said to the judge as he was sentenced on Tuesday.

Part of his plea deal included evaluation and treatment for alcohol dependency.

'I can't be walking around with a gallon of alcohol and think everything's going to be okay,' he added as the judge nodded. 'Once I get the treatment I think everything will work out.'

The incident came after Stanley, who is a U.S. citizen, cut off an electronic monitoring bracelet in Canada and managed to sneak across the border.

Police in Edmonton issued a public warning when they learned that he had taken off the monitoring bracelet and warned U.S. counterparts that Stanley might try to cross the border.

Officials described him as an untreated, violent offender who posed a significant risk.

But U.S. officials allowed him to enter the country after determining he was not the subject of an extraditable arrest warrant, CTV News reported.

Canadian officials announced it would not seek to extradite him because the charges he faced - breach of recognizance, mischief and driving charges - didn't 'warrant engaging the extradition process'.

He registered as a sex 
offender with the King County sheriff's office in Washington and listed his address as
 an intersection just a block away from Pike Place Market.

It's also near a preschool, even though he had been ordered to stay away from children in Canada.

Before the October incident, there was no reason to arrest 
Stanley earlier as Canada hadn't pursued an extraditable warrant and 
he wasn't wanted for any crimes in the United States, authorities said.

Edmonton, Alberta, police spokesman Chad Orydzuk told The Associated Press that Stanley's arrest in Seattle was 'unfortunate but we can't provide comment. It's not our file.'

He has a criminal record stretching back as far as 1987.

In 2011, he was released from prison after a 32-month prison sentence for assault and forcible confinement. It stemmed from claims that he lured two mentally challenged boys into a washroom, blew crack smoke in their faces and sexually assaulted them, according to records.

He was being monitored by police under a
 peace bond when he fled the country. His peace bond had 20 conditions, 
including one ordering him to stay away from children.

He also sexual assaulted an elderly woman and exposed himself to children, according to parole records.

When he surfaced in Seattle, Stanley denied responsibility for many of the convictions and said he was just looking for a new life.

'I said I had enough,' he told KIRO. 'I'm leaving this country because it hasn't been good to me. All they've been doing is belittle me, shafting me, making me look like I'm some kind of menace, some creep, some pedophile, some kind of guy that didn't deserve to be out in the community.'
