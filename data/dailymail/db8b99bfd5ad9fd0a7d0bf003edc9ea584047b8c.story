Scotland Yard chiefs yesterday faced damaging claims that junior officers are routinely bullied to meet ‘draconian’ performance targets.

The allegation followed a report by the Metropolitan Police Federation, the organisation which represents more than 30,000 officers in the capital.

It said there is a ‘culture of fear’ in Britain’s biggest force because of the relentless pressure on officers.

Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne said since the force had introduced a 'more accountable way of doing things', crime rates had reduced by nearly 10 per cent

The Federation, which drafted its report after interviews with 250 officers, called some targets ‘meaningless’ and ‘unrealistic’.

Insiders believe it is only a matter of time before an aggrieved employee takes commanders to a tribunal over bullying claims.

But a senior Scotland Yard officer denied the allegations.

Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne told Radio 4’s Today programme that it was the Met’s job to bring down crime and since it had introduced a ‘more accountable way of doing things’, crime rates had reduced by nearly 10 per cent.

The bullying claims place extra scrutiny on Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who is facing criticism over shredding corruption files, as well as allegations his force had manipulated crime figures.

John Tully, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said his organisation’s report painted a ‘devastating’ picture of life at Scotland Yard.

He told the Today programme that officers who missed targets were put on a ‘hit list’, with some facing potential misconduct action.

‘It’s correct that we are measured on what we do. Whether or not it’s an absolute must that there are performance-driven targets I think is questionable,’ Mr Tully said.

One officer, he claimed, said he had to arrest at least four people a month and had to do ten stop-and-searches, one of which had to have a ‘positive outcome’.
