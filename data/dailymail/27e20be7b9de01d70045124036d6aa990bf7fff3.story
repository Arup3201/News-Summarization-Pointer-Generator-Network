This is the moment a 30 man lynch mob stormed a Russian hospital so they could beat and stab to death a man who had hours before killed a waiter in a restaurant.

Georgiy Ohamov was dragged from his hospital bed, kicked, punched and even had a bench dropped on him before he was finally stabbed to death allegedly in revenge for stabbing waiter Mahil Grukovich in a dispute over the bill.

According to detectives, Ohamov had been with friends at the Baku restaurant in the city earlier in the evening where they had drank wine and vodka.Â

There was then an altercation between Ohamov and the waiter when the bill arrived.

Eyewitness Alexsei Smelenko said: 'It started
 with words, moved on to fists, then chair legs and finally the customer
 grabbed a knife and stabbed the waiter in the chest.

'But by that time he was pretty bloodied too and could barely stand.'

Both injured men were transferred to a local hospital and it is thought relatives of Mahil heard that he was fighting for his life and hatched their plan for revenge.

Police said the crowds, which stormed the hospital in the far eastern city of Tyumen were 'wild with fury' as they carried out the attack.

A police spokesman said: 'We are perhaps fortunate that not more people were killed in this vortex of hatred.'
