THE LONG RIDE HOME by Rupert Isaacson (Penguin £7.99)

Horse sense: Autistic Rowan was stimulated in the saddle

Desperate people often do desperate things and in 2004 Rupert Isaacson did something very desperate indeed. In an attempt to ‘cure’ his six year-old son Rowan of autism, he took him to a shaman called Ghoste in Mongolia.

As Isaacson described in his earlier book, The Horse Boy, the shaman spent three days drawing a strange mucus-like liquid out of Rowan’s head with his fingers — his parents also had to be whipped and to have their private parts anointed with ‘sacred vodka’.

Afterwards, Ghoste promised that Rowan would gradually become less and less autistic until he reached the age of nine — when his autism would disappear completely. But there was one condition attached to all this.

Over the next three years, Isaacson and his wife, Karin, had to take Rowan on other ‘healing journeys’ to shamen or faith healers. The healers could be anywhere in the world, Ghoste told them, but if they didn’t go to see them then his original magic wouldn’t work. The Long Ride Home is Isaacson’s account of what happened next.

Ghoste’s ministrations — whatever they consisted of — seemed to have a dramatic effect on Rowan. He soon stopped having violent tantrums, he was no longer incontinent and he could even hold conversations — something he had never done before. Fearful that he might start backsliding unless they took him to another healer, they went to see the Bushmen of the Kalahari.

Isaacson had previously helped the Bushmen in a land dispute with the Namibian government and one of their healers — a man with the seemingly unpronounceable name of Kunta — tells him that Rowan’s autism is the result of a curse laid on him by disgruntled government employees: ‘They threw a bone at you which missed and hit your son instead.’

Part of the Bushmen’s healing process consists of throwing the bone back from where it came.

Over the next two years, Isaacson takes Rowan to Australia to see an Aborigine called Howard and to New Mexico to see a Native American healer called Blue Horse. Everyone they visit behaves as if curing autism is a complete doddle — ‘I’ve worked with some young men with autism before,’ Howard tells them. ‘Shouldn’t be too much trouble.’ Just like Ghoste in Mongolia, Howard starts drawing ‘slightly bloody mucus’ out of Rowan’s head with his fingers. ‘There,’ he says after a while. ‘That should do it.’

And all of them do seem to do a remarkable amount of good. Rowan starts to swim, to do maths and to play practical jokes. Yet it gradually become clear that there’s also a large element of self-deception here.

Now aged 12, Rowan may be much improved, but he’s not cured, nothing like it.

It’s also impossible to work out how much of this improvement is due to the various shamen and how much to the unstinting care and attention that Isaacson and his wife lavish on Rowan.

Indeed, they devote their lives so wholeheartedly to him — teaching him on horseback and even bouncing on a trampoline because it makes him more responsive — that it finally drives them apart.

You get the feeling too that Isaacson is such a sucker for New Age theories that it’s sent him a bit doolally.

While he starts off the book by seeking a cure, he soon starts moving the goalposts and ends up by saying that ‘autism is not a problem to be fixed. Autism is a collection of gifts, a skill set, a wonderful way of being.’

Is it really? Or is this just another sign of desperation, of someone frantically searching for the good in any situation, however bleak?

But Isaacson then goes several stages further by suggesting that autistic people might be the forerunners of new, more evolved, less egotistical human beings: ‘Do we as autistic parents have a front-row seat at the accelerated evolution of our species?’ he wonders.

The answer to that, I would suggest, is a resounding no. Yet despite spiralling off into battiness, there is enough here to suggest that something — be it the power of mind, ritual or maybe magic itself — can help bring an autistic child from near total darkness out into the world.
