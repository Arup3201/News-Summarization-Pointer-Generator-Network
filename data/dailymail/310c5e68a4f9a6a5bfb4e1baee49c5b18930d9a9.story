Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise — the highest total since 1956.

The new numbers come from the American Public Transportation Association.

Back on track: Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

'People are making a fundamental shift to having options' aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. 'This is a long-term trend. This isn’t just a blip.'

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines.

Overall, LA Metro gained nine million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transport association said.

Riding on: The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Houston and Phoenix, two cities which 
have been more notable for their sprawl than public transportation 
offerings, had large ridership gains.

So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and 
San Diego. The New York area’s behemoth transit network saw the greatest
 gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit
 advocates the nation’s urban shift and the concentration of new 
development around transit hubs show the public increasingly values the 
ability to get around without a car.

'People want to work and live along 
transit lines,''Melaniphy said. 'Businesses, universities and housing 
are all moving along those corridors.'
