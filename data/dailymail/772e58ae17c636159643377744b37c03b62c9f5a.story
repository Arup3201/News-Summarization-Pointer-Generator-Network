The Ohio woman who was accused of breaking into a home west of Cleveland, cleaning it and leaving a bill for $75 has pleaded guilty to attempted burglary.

The 53-year-old Susan Warren told authorities that she was driving by the house one day in May and decided she 'wanted something to do.' 

She broke in, washed some coffee cups, took out the trash, vacuumed and dusted inside the house.

Cleaning intruder: Susan Warren pleaded guilty to breaking into a home to clean it

No reason: Warren said she was simply driving by the house and 'wanted something to do' so she let herself in

Then she left a bill written on a napkin that included her phone number.

When police confronted Warren about the alleged early-morning break in, she told them she 'does it all the time.'

Warren allegedly broke into the home in Westlake, Ohio after picking the house at random while driving down the street, she said.

When the homeowners' 18-year-old daughter woke up to find the house had been cleaned, she assumed her parents had hired a maid, the victim Sherry Bush told WKYC-TV.

Housekeeping bill: The Ohio woman left a handwritten note on a napkin which read 'I was here to clean' along with her name, address and '$75'

'There were some coffee mugs that my husband had out,' she said. 'She had washed them all.

'She wrote a note [on a napkin] and left it on the table, saying, "$75 I was here to clean", and left her name and number,' Bush said. 

Warren says that she owns a cleaning business and sometimes enters homes, cleans them and leaves a bill.

The 'cleaning fairy' was also caught in another property in February and was found guilty of criminal trespass.

Warren is scheduled to be sentenced next month. Details of the plea bargain and the terms of her expected sentence weren't released.
