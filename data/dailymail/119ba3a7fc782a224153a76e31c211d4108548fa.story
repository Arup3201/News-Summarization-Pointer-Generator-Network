Smiles have been hard to come by among the Real Madrid camp of late but as preparations ramped up for their El Clasico date with Barcelona the mood was decidedly buoyant.

Under-fire Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were in full swing during hurdling drills and five-a-side games at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Thursday.

Perhaps the air of positivity stems from numbers that suggest despite their recent run of poor form, which has included a 4-3 defeat by Schalke as they scraped through to the Champions League quarter-finals and falling from the top of La Liga, a trip to the Nou Camp could be just what the doctor ordered.

The facts are that, despite being in the rare position of being underdogs at the weekend, away from home Ronaldo and Bale are Spanish club football's most dangerous forward duo.

The Portuguese Ballon d'Or winner and the Welsh winger have more away goals than any other strike partnership, even Lionel Messi and Neymar.

Their combined 22 goals in 14 games when not braving the white handkerchiefs of their Bernabeu is leads Messi and Neymar's tally of 18 outside the Nou Camp.

Ronaldo has 15 of those and will be keen to catch the Messi, the prodigious Argentine who has been on fire in 2015 with 20 goals in 17 matches in all competition and overtook the Portuguese to be La Liga's top goal scorer.

Bale, who broke a nine-match goal drought with a double at home in their 2-0 win over Levante, will also be keen to work his way back into favour with Real fans and the Spanish press, who have recently labelled him 'lazy' and a 'ball hog'.

Ahead of their trip to Barcelona for Sunday's 9pm kick-off, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti enlisted second division Castilla players Martin Odegaard, the Norwegian wunderkid, and Ruben Yanez to make up the numbers.

With Bale and Ronaldo in full flight, only Sami Khedira was missing through a stomach illness while James Rodriguez's foot injury is still on the mend.
