The slow start to the nation's tornado season came to a blustery end Wednesday when tornadoes hit Arkansas and Oklahoma and left one person dead and several others injured.    

Tulsa County Sheriff's Capt. Billy McKelvey says a mobile home park near Sand Springs in the Tulsa area was nearly destroyed Wednesday. It's not clear yet whether it was a tornado or straight-line winds that hit the mobile home park.

McKelvey says one person was killed there. He said multiple other people were injured, though he couldn't say exactly how many people

The mobile home park southwest of that town was 'hit very hard,' said Chief Daniel Bradley of the Sand Springs Fire Department.

Has said that  24 homes were damaged, some of them rolled over.

'Take cover in a basement or storm shelter now!' the weather service advised those affected by the storm.

A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for the area until late on Wednesday night.

Until Tuesday, when a waterspout formed over an Arkansas lake, the U.S. hadn't had a tornado in more than a month.

Sirens also went off at Moore, Oklahoma, where 24 people died in a top-of-the-scale EF5 tornado in 2013.

Television coverage on Wednesday evening showed a small twister on the ground. Another tornado was reported near the fairgrounds in western Oklahoma City.

Storm chasers took to the windy streets to capture photos of the blasts and posted their images to Twitter. 

The tornado season usually ramps up for parts of the U.S. in March, but weather patterns funneled cold air into much of the country, depriving the atmosphere of the warm, moist air necessary for form bad storms for most of the month.

That all changed this week. Southerly winds pushed temperatures into the 70s and 80s across the Ozarks and Southern Plains, while weather fronts churned the air into Wednesday's storms.

Meteorologist Jeff Hood in Little Rock said a weak 'waterspout' tornado briefly touched down in Bull Shoals Lake in Marion County in northwest Arkansas on Tuesday night.

 He said it will likely be classified an EF0 — the weakest tornado with wind speeds of 65 to 85 mph. A 'waterspout' forms over water.

The tornado on Tuesday never made it onto land, and there were no reports of damage.

'This will be the 'tornado' that breaks the drought for March,' Greg Carbin, warning coordination meteorologist for the Storm Prediction Center, said Wednesday.

Before this week, only about two-dozen twisters had been recorded this year during a period when about 120 are typical. The last time the U.S. had no twisters in March was nearly 50 years ago, according to figures from the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

The National Weather Service called the storm 'extremely dangerous.'

'You are in a life threatening situation. Flying debris will be deadly to those caught without shelter. Mobile Homes will be destroyed. Considerable damage to homes, businesses and vehicles is likely and complete destruction possible,' said a Google weather update posted just minutes ago.

Storms: A cluster or line of thunderstorms should form from eastern Oklahoma into western/northern Arkansas, southern/eastern Missouri, far southern Illinois and western Kentucky

A second storm passed through the city a half-hour later, prompting another tornado warning. 

News 9 reported on a few 'weak' and not very life-threatening tornadoes earlier in the evening. 

The Storm Prediction Center had warned that a clash of warm and cooler air masses could lead to violent storms. It predicted mostly hail and high winds, but said tornadoes couldn't be ruled out.

Tornadoes were also reported in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas. No injuries were reported there, either.

News 9 reports that hail the size of baseballs and golf balls have been common in many of the communities that the storms have moved through.

Over 7,000 homes are without power.
