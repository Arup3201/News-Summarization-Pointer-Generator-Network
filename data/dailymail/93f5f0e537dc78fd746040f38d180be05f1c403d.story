John Garner, 53, died after being found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday

Police have launched a murder investigation after a British man was found dead aboard his burnt-out yacht in the Caribbean Sea.

Sailing instructor John Edward Garner, 53, was discovered with head and leg injuries after the coastguard responded to reports that a yacht was on fire off the coast of St Vincent.

He was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital yesterday afternoon.

Police
 are now searching for a woman called Heidi Hukkelaas, with whom he flew
 to St Vincent on January 19. She is believed to be his Norwegian wife.

But ex-pats living on the island - including the dive instructor who discovered Mr Garner's body - say Miss Hukkelaas left her partner two days previously, to return to Norway to look after her children, as planned.

And despite Caribbean police claiming to be searching for Ms Hukkelaas, Norwegian authorities said no requests have been made with them regarding her whereabouts, only to inform Norwegian relatives that Mr Garner had died.

'We have not been asked to do anything but inform relatives of the incident,’ a spokesperson for Norwegian Police told Verdens Gang.

‘We are not aware that the Norwegian woman is wanted internationally and there is no such request regarding this woman in our system.’

Kay Wilson, who owns Indigo Watersports, and is originally from Bristol, said she was taking a boat trip full of guests from a nearby hotel resort, when she saw smoke on the horizon and went to investigate.

She said she and her crew discovered Mr Garner's body free floating in the water wearing a life jacket, with severe lacerations to his face and legs.

A burning life raft was also found close to the yacht, which was well ablaze, she said.

His passport and personal documents were floating nearby in a waterproof 'grab bag' - a tool commonly used by yachtsman in case of emergency.

Only his personal details were found in the bag, indicating that he was alone, she said.

She said: 'There was a lot of debris in the water, as there commonly is with explosions.

'He was free floating in the water. A life raft was nearby but it didn't appear to have deployed properly and that was on fire too.

'The heat from the burning vessel was such that we could feel it when we were approaching.'

St Vincent 
police commissioner Michael Charles said: ‘We are treating the death as 
suspicious and are looking at all lines of inquiry. We suspect foul play and will investigate the matter fully.

‘Miss
 Hukkelaas is a person of interest and as with every murder 
investigation we have to look at everyone and everything and will leave 
no stones unturned.’

Officers said checks revealed Miss Hukkelaas had not left the country via any of the island’s main airports or seaports.

The commissioner refused to confirm her nationality or relationship to the deceased last night.

However,
 Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang has been in touch with the Ms 
Hukkelaas' family and they have confirmed that she is back in her home 
country, arriving the day before the incident.

Mr Garner's daughter Elisabeth, 37,  
told the MailOnline that her family were unaware that her father's death
 was being treated as suspicious, and was instead a 'tragic accident'.

She
 said she had spoken to her step-mother who had left St Vincent two days
 before Mr Garner, to head back to Norway and look after her young 
children.

She said: 'She always leaves before him.

'This
 is a shock for everybody. We have not been told that this is being 
treated as suspicious. As far as we have been told, it is being treated 
as a tragic accident.'

Ms Wilson said she also believed it could have been simply an accident.

Police say the life raft was found approximately 15 nautical miles west of Buccament in southwestern St. Vincent

She
 said: 'It was lunchtime, I think he may have gone to the galley to make
 himself something to eat and the lacerations on his face and legs lead 
me to believe he was bending over a gas canister.

'If someone had killed him onboard, he wouldn't have been able to try and deploy his life raft.

'I have been living in Caribbean for long time and have helped rescue people in severe floods.

'When
 you attend you expect to help people. If you do encounter someone that 
you are unable to help, one thing that makes it more tolerable, was at
 least we were able to uncover Mr Garner's body for his family. '

A sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, 
said the divorced grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a physical trainer for British special forces.

Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent

He had previously divorced from a Norwegian woman and had several children and grandchildren, the source said.

The friend said: ‘It is very shocking 
news. He was a very nice man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was 
meticulous about the way he kept it. He had a military attitude towards 
things and was a strict sailing instructor.

‘He
 is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special 
forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did
 not have a rank.

‘He
 loved sailing and I know Heidi went with him sometimes, although I 
never met her. He was often in the Caribbean and would then come back to
 Norway, where he had a house.’

The friend said they had previously spoken to Mr Garner about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent.

‘Me
 and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St
 Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at.

‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes.

‘Boat
 boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and 
then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come 
back at night time.

‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.

’Yesterday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out.

The
 yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off 
the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, 
which boasts several five-star hotels.

Police said Mr Garner and Miss Hukkelaas had recently been granted permission to extend their stay on the island until April 19.

The Asante was is described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabins

Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000.

The
 online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and 
lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other
 kills.

It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat.

‘Skipper
 and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster 
system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’

The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins.

The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’.

The
 murder comes just two months after retired management consultant Roger 
Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers 
attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St 
Lucia.

The couple, from 
Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their 
£200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at 
night.

Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt’s murder and theft and are awaiting trial.
