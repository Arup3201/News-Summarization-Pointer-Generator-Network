A young soldier who survived a Taliban bomb blast on the frontline in Afghanistan has been found hanged while on home leave.

Trooper Robert Griffiths, 24, was driving a light tank when it was hit by a Taliban roadside bomb last year.

The three stunned soldiers inside the tank walked away from the explosion unharmed - thanks to the new armour of their new 35-ton Scimitar Mk2.

Trooper Robert Griffiths, who survived a Taliban bomb blast and was part of a challenging seven-month tour of Helmand Province, has been found hanged while on home leave

After the lucky escape Robert said: 'I'm massively impressed with the amount of protection the upgraded armour provided.

'It was obviously a shock - but I’ve never had such a buzz in my life.'

Hero Robert served in the Dale barracks-based regiment in Paderborn, Germany, and was on home leave for Christmas.

The soldier was found hanged at his home in Bishopston, near Swansea, South Wales, on Saturday evening. He was on home leave staying with his parents Paul and Mary.

Trooper Griffiths was serving with the 1st The Queen’s Dragoon Guards - known as the Welsh Cavalry - which lost two soldiers on the same tour of duty.

Tragedy: Robert Griffiths was found hanged while on Christmas home leave from the Army

Lieutenant David Boyce and Lance Corporal Richard Scanlon were killed while serving with the regiment in Afghanistan.

They died in November 2011 when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device (IED) and a number of service personnel wounded.

The regiment returned from their challenging seven-month tour of Helmand Province last April.

They marched in Swansea as part of their Freedom of the City last May to mark their return from operations in Helmand Province.

An Army spokesman said: 'Police are investigating the death of a soldier who was serving with 1st The Queen’s Dragoon Guards.

'Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.'

A police spokesman said the soldier’s death was not being treated as suspicious and his family had been informed.

He said: 'South Wales Police in Swansea are investigating the unexplained death of a 24-year-old man. 'There are believed to be no suspicious circumstances.

'The next of kin and HM Coroner have been informed.'
