A New York-based designer and art director has embarked on a project which aims to catalog the intricate mosaic Subway signs of New York's vast underground network – and reveal their untold stories.

Adam Chang, a Brooklyn native, has been quietly looking past the grimy, crowded tunnels that snake beneath the city to find beauty in the unique ceramic art works that have stood for over a century, often unappreciated.

So far, he has covered 118 stations, which he photographs and then digitally illustrates, and has spent 20 hours riding trains to document the signs for his NY Train Project.

Art: Designer Adam Chung has launched the NY Train Project, which catalogs his illustrations of the beautiful mosaic signs of MTA's New York subway system, including this sign for Bleecker Street

'One day while waiting for the 6 train at the Bleecker stop, I began to notice the intricate details of the carefully placed tiles in the station sign,' he writes of his project.

'Which led me to noticing other station signs and how they were all different, infused with the personality of the neighborhood.'

The New York MTA Subway system - one of the world's oldest and largest - first opened in October of 1904, and its creators, George Heins and Christopher LaFarge, opted to use ceramic tiles to craft the signs because they would be long-lasting and easy to keep clean.

Begin your trip: Mr Chang has so far captured 118 stations and aims to eventually cover the whole of the Manhattan network. His photos are organized online by train line (pictured)

Intricate: The project is made up Mr Chung's digital illustrations of the signs, which he first travels to and photographs, such as this example (pictured) of a sign for the 81st Street Museum of Natural History stop

Old: New York's Subway system is one of the oldest and the largest in the world, first opening in 1904 - this sign for Canal Street (pictured) dates to 1917

And they were right about them lasting. The signs have largely stood the test of time, with newer works installed every year on the network.

Throughout several re-designs of MTA's network, including a major brand overhaul in 1970 which altered the maps and color coding of the lines, the mosaic signs have always remained immune to change.

Many of the illustrative mosaics that appear were originally intended not only to be aesthetically pleasing, but to offer non-English speakers and tourists clues as to where they were going.

Unnoticed: Mr Chang says he traveled the Subway for many years before he began to notice the beauty in the intricate mosaic signs

Practical: The signs were originally fashioned from mosaic tiles because they were long-lasting and easy to clean

Claim to fame: This station can be seen in the backdrop of David Bowie's 'I'm Afraid of Americans' music video, just one among several stops to have appeared in movies and videos over the years

Many of the signs Mr Chang has captured and added to his online gallery include snippets of long-forgotten, or never before told information about each station’s history.

For example, the Lower East Side’s Bowery station, where the J and Z trains stop, houses a 'Future Doorway' which enables the construction of another opening - one that has never been needed as Bowery has historically been one of the most under-used stops on the MTA network.

Similarly, the F train’s East Broadway station has a strip of mosaic around a quaint locked door, behind which is a level that was intended for the never-built Worth Street line.

History lesson: The Bowery station (pictured) is one of few to house a 'Future Doorway' which was built to enable a new underground opening, yet to be used in this case

Secret: Behind this locked door (pictured), there's another level that was intended for an unbuilt line, captured by Mr Chang, who wants his gallery to serve as a 'tribute' to the history of the MTA

Some of the stations have appeared in movies and music videos.

The 1 train’s Christopher Street station in the West Village can be seen in the backdrop of David Bowie's 'I'm Afraid of Americans' video, while the 1 and 2 train’s entire 23rd Street station on 7th Avenue gets destroyed in the 1998 version of Godzilla.

'I hope this gallery can serve as not only a tribute to the history of the subway stations but also as a quick guide to getting around New York via the MTA,' says Mr Chang.

SubwayTileShirts.com is now selling premium T-Shirts which feature the tile designs for $38 a pop.
