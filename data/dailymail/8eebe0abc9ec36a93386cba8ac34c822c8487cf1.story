The mother of two boys who suffer from the same fatal disease is fighting to give one of them access to a drug that seems to be curing the other.

Jenn McNary's sons, Max, 11, and Austin, 14, of Vermont, have Duchene Muscular Dystrophy, a disease caused by a gene mutation that leads to muscle breakdown and eventual death.

But only Max qualifies for the clinical trial of a new drug called Eteplirsen, which is designed to stop the disease from progressing.

Max's illness had not progressed as far as Austin's when researchers began offering the clinical trial. To qualify for the trial, patients had to perform a six-minute walking assessment, which Austin was unable to complete.

As a result, only Max - along with a dozen other children - qualified for the drug. Max started taking it nearly two years ago.

'Before the drug he was falling a lot, and beginning to depend on his manual wheelchair most of the day to get around,' Jenn McNary, the boys' mother, told the parenting website SheKnows.com.

Now, his condition has improved so much that he is able to run, jump and climb stairs, she said.

'It’s a miracle,' McNary, told NBC. 'It really is a miracle drug. This is something that nobody ever expected and he looks like an almost normal 11-year-old.'

Meanwhile, Austin remains bound to his wheelchair and his condition is worsening every day.

'He can’t get into a chair, out of his wheelchair, into his bed and onto the toilet,' McNary said. Austin has been wheelchair-bound since he was 10 years old. He is now 14.

Heartbreakl: For Austin (center), watching his younger brother (left) get healthier with each day is equally heartbreaking and inspiring

For Austin, watching his younger brother get healthier with each day is equally heartbreaking and inspiring.

'It's really hard because I know I'm getting worse and he's getting better,' he told NBC.

Now McNary is determined to get Austin access to the drug that has seemed to cure her other son, but the Food and Drug Administration won't allow anyone who doesn't qualify for a clinical trial to take a drug that hasn't yet been approved.

She has reached out to the FDA to make an exception for Austin and started an online petition to bring attention to her cause. The agency says her son's case is still pending.

Playful: The boys appear happy and playful despite their deadly disease

Without the drug, 'in the next six or seven years, [Austin] will die,' McNary said. 'But we hope that doesn’t happen.'

She said their family doesn't celebrate Max's improvements because that would be too hard on Austin, who sadly needs the drug far more than his brother, at this point.

'At the end of the day we’re talking about a family cut down the middle, with one son thriving and the other son literally dying while waiting for the life-saving drug,' she told SheKnows.com. 'It’s painful and raw and I don't think there is a person in the world who doesn't feel for Austin as he waits for his turn.'
