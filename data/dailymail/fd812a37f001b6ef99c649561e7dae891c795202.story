The killers of Stephen Lawrence were refused leave to appeal against their convictions yesterday.

David Norris, 35, and Gary Dobson, 36, claimed their six-week trial at the Old Bailey which resulted in unanimous guilty verdicts was unfair.

But a judge rejected their written applications at the Court of Appeal.

They were given life sentences in January for the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum  of 15 years and two months, while Norris  was given a minimum of 14 years and three months.

The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which for 15 years has campaigned for justice for the Lawrence family.

Norris subsequently launched an appeal on the basis that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial.

In the video, shot 20 months after Stephen’s 1993 murder, Norris was secretly filmed  telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people.

In an appalling rant recorded by a  police surveillance camera, Norris boasted he would ‘skin a black ****’ and ‘blow their two arms and legs off’. Then, he said, he would tell them: ‘Go on, you can swim home now.’ 

Norris’s legal team argued that the video was highly prejudicial because it did not prove he was involved in Stephen’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence.

The video also showed Dobson using violent, racist language.

Over a period of 17 days in  December 1994, detectives heard him frequently use racist terms to describe black and Asian people, jurors heard.

Dobson was seen in one clip recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife.

Lawyers for Norris also objected to the way the prosecution presented the scientific evidence during the trial.

The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists were called in. They found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair’s homes.

The defence claimed this was the result of contamination, but that was rejected by the jury.

Dobson and Norris were the first people convicted over the knife attack on A-level student Stephen, 18, by a group of white youths near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.

Yesterday Norris’s legal team indicated that this was just the first round of their efforts to challenge the convictions. His lawyers will now consider whether to renew the application before judges sitting at the Appeal Court.

He said: ‘We will obviously give very serious consideration to the judge’s response to the legal application and decide whether to renew it orally.’
