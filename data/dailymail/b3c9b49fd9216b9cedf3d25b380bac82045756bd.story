The parents of a BBC journalist who is thought to have committed suicide after suffering alleged sexual harassment at work have blamed the corporation for failing to prevent his death.

Radio reporter Russell Joslin, 50, whose father is a former chief constable, suffocated despite being on suicide watch at a psychiatric hospital.

Close friends and relatives have told the Daily Mail he had been left a ‘shadow of his former self’ after feeling that bosses failed to act on his complaints about a senior woman colleague.

They said his descent into mental illness began after he allegedly spurned unwanted sexual advances by the woman broadcaster during a night out at a restaurant near his home in affluent Kenilworth, Warwickshire.

Mr Joslin’s parents said he was forced to leave her in the restaurant because of her behaviour, after which she sent him a flurry of abusive phone messages which have been played to the Daily Mail and in which she swore and belittled him.

Peter Joslin, the retired chief constable of Warwickshire, said that while questions need to be asked at the hospital over how his son was apparently able to take his own life, the BBC should hold an investigation into his treatment.

Mr Joslin, 78, added: ‘There is some evidence to support accusations that Russell was being sexually harassed or bullied.

‘I am shocked to discover the apparent attitudes of certain individuals to their employees at the BBC.

‘I believe he was ignored by his bosses, despite outlining his concerns about the particular staff member he claimed had sexually harassed him.

‘He enjoyed his work at the BBC but in recent years the situation had become intolerable for him there.’

St Michael's hospital where Russell Joslin was admitted for help and later found dead

Mr Joslin, who lives with wife Kathy next door to their son’s home, retired in 1998 after 44 years’ service – the longest-serving policeman ever in the UK.

He said his son’s alleged ‘sexual harassment’ by the female colleague at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire was the ‘trigger’ which caused his mental illness.

There had been ‘plenty of opportunities’ for managers to intervene after he complained, but ‘nothing was done to help him’.

Mr Joslin said he felt more should have been done to pick up the problems as his son was clearly quite distressed.

Their son was admitted to St Michael’s psychiatric hospital in Warwick on Friday after suffering minor injuries when he walked in to the road and was hit by a bus in an apparent suicide attempt.

Mr Joslin senior said the hospital ‘specialises in people who are at high risk of committing suicide and he was checked every 15 minutes.’

He was found choking on Sunday and taken to nearby Warwick Hospital, where he was pronounced dead the following afternoon.

His family and his ex-girlfriend, Lucy Poulson, claimed that after propositioning him in the restaurant, the woman – no longer at the station – began targeting him in other ways at work, deliberately cutting him off while he was on air.

It is understood that Mr Joslin, a bachelor who covered south Warwickshire for the station, first complained about her to management after she sent him an unpleasant email.

He is thought to have approached bosses again early this year to complain about being sidelined at the station, concerned he had been overlooked for news reading and presenting opportunities.

Miss Poulson said he then became consumed by worry and stress ‘because he knew that people don’t go very far by speaking out against organisations like the BBC’.

He was diagnosed with depression and suffered a breakdown soon afterwards.

Miss Poulson, 28, a freelance theatre director, told the Daily Mail that the BBC had paid for him to receive counselling.

His GP and the corporation’s own occupational health specialist all advised him not to return to work at the station for the good of his health.

But despite this bosses told him he would have to return full time before he could think about transferring to another station.

Mr Joslin eventually went back to work three months later, but on a part-time basis.

Miss Poulson said she split from Mr Joslin in 2010, after four years together, but the pair remained close. She said that in recent months he had been ‘the happiest I had known him’ and was considering returning to freelance journalism.

She said that for years he felt unable to speak out against his tormentor. When he finally did pluck up the courage to speak out, she said the office climate left him fearful for his job and future.

Miss Poulson added: ‘Russell told me that this woman treated many people badly at the station, but nothing was done because of her senior status.

'It seemed everybody was scared to tackle her. People need to know that this culture still exists – of allowing certain individuals to be in control, when others don’t seem to matter.’

Russell Joslin recorded the following three messages from his female colleague after he left her in the restaurant. ‘Thanks a lot, you’ve p***** on your chips. I’m trying to get a taxi to Coventry. Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t ever ever ever think of me as your mate again. Do what you have to at the BBC because you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever ever encroach on me or my talent.’ ‘Hi, it’s me. I’m in a taxi from Kenilworth to Coventry. Russell, don’t ever count on me as a friend. I’m going home. Please don’t think you can rely on me – you’ve insulted me. You have left me stranded in Kenilworth. You are flaky, you are poor, you are weak. I don’t want anything to do with you except on the radio. Goodbye.’‘Hi, it’s 9.21. I’m back at my car. Don’t ever ever ever presume friendship with me again, all right? Goodbye.’

Neither Warwickshire Police, responsible for policing in Kenilworth, or West Midlands Police, which covers Coventry, could find any record of Mr Joslin reporting the alleged harassment.

The woman he accused said there was never a complaint against her and she denied any wrongdoing.

She said she was asked by managers to try to help him.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘I got a message to say Russell had died. I’m really upset about it and can’t say any more.’

Told of the Joslin family’s allegations that his illness had been triggered by her alleged behaviour, she said: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about’ and put the phone down.

Mr Joslin’s colleagues are being offered counselling by the BBC. His funeral is to be held on Wednesday.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and condolences are with Russell Joslin’s family at this sad time.

'This is a difficult time for everyone who knew him.

'The BBC is committed to working constructively with the family to ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed. It would not be appropriate to comment further until the facts are established.’

An inquest into Mr Joslin’s death was opened yesterday at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa.

Coroner Sean McGovern was told the radio presenter died of ‘asphyxiation’ as a result of a ‘plastic bag in an airway’.
