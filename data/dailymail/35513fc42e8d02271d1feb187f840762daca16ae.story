Matt Prior has hit back at Kevin Pietersen after the former England batsman accused him of leading a concerted regime of bullying within the team.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph ahead of the publishing of his new autobiography on Monday, Pietersen described Prior as a 'bad influence' within the England set-up.

Pietersen said: 'Alastair Cook isn’t the greatest speaker but his sidekick Matt Prior could talk the hind legs off a donkey. So Cook wanted Prior close to him.

'He wanted his vice-captain to do all his talking for him. So when I went after Prior I said he shouldn’t be in the team, he’s a bad influence, a negative influence, he picks on players.'

Prior, currently recovering from achilles surgery, responded in good humour on Twitter on Monday.

He wrote: 'After this morning I'm looking forward to reading the full kp book. Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!!

Prior added: 'Obvs (sic) sad to see the accusations against me this am and I WILL have my right of reply! However today is not the day and Twitter is not the place for it! Now back to my Achilles rehab and learning to walk again! have a great day everyone.'
