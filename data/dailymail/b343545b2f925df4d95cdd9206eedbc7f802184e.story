M&S has today  unveiled its 2014 Christmas campaign in all its festive glory - and revealed that it's behind the elusive @TheTwoFairies social media account that has been mysteriously granting wishes to people via Twitter.

M&S’ famous Christmas strap line ‘Magic & Sparkle’ is brought to life this year in the form of two playful fairies, named Magic and Sparkle, who spread a little festive kindness as the stars of the retailer’s advertising campaign.

Set to the catchy classic Julie London version of ‘Fly Me to the Moon’, Magic and Sparkle take the lead role, as they clock in for a day’s work at the Fairy Factory.

It's here! M&S has today unveiled its 2014 Christmas campaign starring two fairies who spread festive kindness to people across the UK

Soaring the city skies, the duo are eager to bring a smile to the unaware people below - gifting snowfall to children stuck indoors, adorning grey washing lines with glittering party dresses and sparking love between a lonely pair. 

A spokesperson for M&S said: 'The magic of Christmas is how it brings out that little part in all of us that wants to believe in the extraordinary. 

Spreading joy: The two fairies, named Magic and Sparkle, can be seen soaring the city skies eager to bring a smile to the unaware people below

Secret is out: M&S has also revealed it is behind @TheTwoFairies - the twitter based duo who have kept the nation guessing on their random acts of kindness over the last seven days

Real life acts: At Britain's most southerly school, Landewednack Primary in Cornwall, children were amazed to find the school mysteriously covered in a fresh fall of snow, thanks to @TheTwoFairies 

'It’s a moment to escape the realities of every day and give in to the joyfulness of the festive spirit. We wanted to capture that feeling and bring Magic and Sparkle to life in a fun and light-hearted way that spreads a little cheer.'

Taking cues from the ad, M&S’ two fairies have been on an undercover social media mission in the run up to their TV debut, as they visited cities throughout the UK, delivering kind surprises to the unsuspecting public.

Working under their twitter alias @TheTwoFairies, Magic and Sparkle have journeyed across the country. 

Who are they? Taking cues from the ad, M&S' two fairies have been on an undercover social media mission in the run up to their TV debut leaving the nation guessing as to who they were

At Britain’s most southerly school, Landewednack Primary in Cornwall, children were amazed to find the school mysteriously covered in a fresh fall of snow, and the pair startled onlookers as they were glimpsed in flight above the river Tyne in Newcastle. Other fairy ‘sightings’ where reported in towns across the UK – including Birmingham, London, Glasgow and Manchester.

Via @TheTwoFairies, the pair have been responding to those posting about life’s daily problems with random acts of kindness. 

Treating workers on long hospital night shifts, salvaging failed dinner plans and rescuing rain-soaked commuters are just a few of the little acts the duo have undertaken to brighten up individuals’ days.

Bringing joy to Britain: Magic and Sparkle delivered flowers to people who were unwell and spread fake snow across a school ground. The duo will continue their random acts of kindness  for the whole festive season

At every point, the only clue has been a calling card citing @TheTwoFairies #FollowTheFairies.

The spokesperson added: “The real magic has not been driven by us but by the spirit of generosity the two fairies have ignited in the social community. People have not been wishing for themselves, instead they’ve taken genuine pleasure in kindness to others.'

Magic and Sparkle will continue their random acts of kindness via @TheTwoFairies for the whole festive season, supported by more magical surprises across M&S stores and online channels.

Customers can get a first look at the ad on M&S’ social channels from midday today, or catch the premiere of the TV ad during this Saturday’s (8th November) X-Factor on ITV1.
