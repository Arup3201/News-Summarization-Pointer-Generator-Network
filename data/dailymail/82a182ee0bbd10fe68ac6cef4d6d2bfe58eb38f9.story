Manchester United and Barcelona target Daley Blind admits he would not be able to resist a move to one of Europe's biggest clubs, but insisted he has not yet done a deal with either team.

Blind, who starred for Holland during their run to the World Cup semi-final, is a target for both Louis van Gaal and Luis Enrique, and the 24-year-old told Goal.com that he would be excited by the prospect of joining either.

But the Ajax midfielder also claimed he was happy in Holland, and that he is unsure that the physicality of the Premier League would suit him.

Star quality: The Ajax midfielder scored against hosts Brazil in the World Cup third place play-off

'It would be very hard to turn down these kind of clubs,' said Blind. 'But there's no serious interest as of yet.

'You can never make promises in football. When you make a promise, you have to stick to it. There are plenty of players who promise to stay and then leave after all. I am keeping my options open. I am very happy in Amsterdam and at Ajax, but you never know what could happen.'

Blind played all of Holland's seven World Cup games under Van Gaal, scoring in the third place play-off, but expressed a preference to go to Spain rather than follow his international boss to the Premier League. 

Physical challenge: Blind admitted that he would prefer La Liga to England, which does not suit his game

'La Liga would suit my style of play. Perhaps England as well, but that's a very physical competition and that's not my biggest strength. I have made steps forward physically, but fighting out personal duels is not my thing. I am not like Jan Vertonghen, who is very powerful.'
