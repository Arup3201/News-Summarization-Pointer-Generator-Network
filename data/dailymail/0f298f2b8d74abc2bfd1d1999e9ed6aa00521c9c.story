The bizarre architecture that has sprung up along China's skyline over the past few years could soon become a thing of the past, after Beijing announced a crackdown on 'weird buildings'.

The capital city's vice mayor Chen Gang announced that Beijing would be taking a greater role in influencing building aesthetics by specifying standards in size, style, color and materials.

He said that by managing urban design, Beijing will demonstrate its modern spirit without abandoning its local characteristics as a historical city.

Chinese President Xi Jinping insisted buildings such as the CCTV headquarters - nicknamed 'Big Pants' due to its design looking like a par of trousers - should no longer pop up in the city

According to China Daily, Mr Chen added that the next step is to pay attention to the design of public areas, providing habitable spaces for residents as well as creating a better cityscape.

China's cities have become well-known for the bizarre buildings that adorn the skyline, including space-age eggs, a phallic-shaped newspaper tower, a giant golden doughnut and a tea-pot shaped structure.

Fed-up with the garish, novelty shapes, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an end to 'weird architecture' during a two-hour speech at a literary symposium in Beijing in October.

Mr Xi, who took over as China's Communist Party leader nearly two years ago, called for morally-inspiring architecture that should 'be like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste and clean up undesirable work styles'.

He insisted buildings such as the CCTV headquarters - nicknamed 'Big Pants' due to its design looking like a par of trousers - should no longer pop up in the city.

But Dutch architect and Pritzker-prize laureate Rem Koolhaas, who designed the CCTV building, told CNN that he is unconcerned by the prospect of a crackdown in Beijing.

'There have been periods (in China) where ordinances existed, there were mayors who insisted (to put) Chinese roofs on modern buildings but it's like a pendulum,' he said, while attending a design conference in Hong Kong.

'I'd like to see (the rules when they are announced). There was a rule that buildings had to be grey, and the CCTV building is grey, and I don't think it is diminished because of that.'

Mr Koolhaas added that he did not believe the 'weird buildings' remarks were aimed at the iconic CCTV building.

'The media has made that connection,' he said. 'No more weird buildings, it's understandable if you look around and I don't feel that CCTV is a weird building so that's my comment.'
