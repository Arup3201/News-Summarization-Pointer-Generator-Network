During the dark days of the First World War, 2nd Lieutenant JRR Tolkien kept his revolver close to him at all times as he fought to survive the front-line trenches.

Now the precious gun is going on display for the first time, helping Lord of the Rings fans connect with the history that helped shape the author's writing.

The Webley MK VI was given to Tolkien who joined the 11th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers in June 1916.

He was an Oxford University in 1914, but only two years later was serving as a battalion signals officer during the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest conflicts in history.

Best
 known for his classic titles The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings 
trilogy, Tolkien served in the Great War through the summer and autumn 
of 1916 before contracting trench fever due to weeks of tension being 
weighed down in wretched conditions.

He was sent back to hospital in Birmingham, West Midlands, where he remained unfit for the rest of the war, and so began to write early versions of his 'Middle Earth' stories.

Debate still continues regarding the extent to which Tolkien's war experiences influenced his literary work, however the impact of the battle remained with him for the rest of his life and fans say its influence can clearly be seen in his writing.

His gun, which was an updated version of the Webley Mk V - the standard British service revolver at the outbreak of World War I - will go on display in the Imperial War Museum North's Main Exhibition Space in Manchester this month.

The museum is holding an exhibition next year to mark the centenary of the war, called 'From Street To Trench: A War That Shaped A Region'.

Tolkien is best known for his books, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy

Graham Boxer, director of IWM North, said: 'This December, just as the latest The Hobbit film launches in cinemas, visitors to IWM North will be able to see this weapon and connect further with Tolkien's magical stories which were born from harrowing wartime experiences.

'Exhibiting this object is for us the start of what will be an extremely busy time as we prepare to launch our major First World War Centenary exhibition.'

Tolkien graduated from the University of Oxford in June 1915 and soon obtained a commission in the army as a Second Lieutenant.

In June 1916 Tolkien went to France and was posted to the 11th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers.

Between June and November 1916, more than one million people were killed in the Battle of The Somme.

Tolkien and his battalion were posted there from 1916 and he occupied front line trenches in Beaumont-Hamel, Serre and the Leipzig Salient.

The Imperial War Museum tells the story of people who have lived, fought and died in conflicts involving Britain and the Commonwealth since the First World War. 

The 'One Ring' has been likened to the atomic bomb

Although the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit author has denied his story was an allegory for World War I or II, he did admit that no author can ‘remain wholly unaffected by his experience’.

This denial has not stopped fans of the novels from speculating, and noting the parallels between the books and the wars Tolkien lived through.

Characters Sauron and Saruman have been compared with Hitler and Stalin, while the marshes of Mordor have been likened to World War I’s Western Front.

The ‘One Ring’, meanwhile, has been speculated to symbolise the atomic bomb.

While John Garth, the author of Tolkien and the Great War, said that Tolkien denied the comparisons, he strongly believes Tolkien was inspired by his experiences in World War I.

'People think about the Second World War but it was that First World War that shaped a lot of his writing,' he said.

Mr Garth said that the main character in Lords of the Rings, Frodo Baggins, can rightfully be compared with a young war officer and his journey with the 'traumatising experiences of war'.

On Frodo's main companion to Mordor, meanwhile, Mr Garth said: 'Tolkien specifically said that Samwise Gamgee was a kind of tribute to the servants that he had known in World War One.'
