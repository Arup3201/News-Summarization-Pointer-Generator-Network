Internet users have the right to tell Google to hide embarrassing details of their past in search results, European judges  ruled yesterday.

Anyone will be able to ask the technology giant and other search engines to block any reference to information about their life.

Although content cannot be removed  from the internet altogether, the decision means it can be hidden from search results if it is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’.

The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30

Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under
 Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to 
‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to 
them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This
 particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, 
when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was 
collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the 
storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. 

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who
 has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, 
including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined.

It effectively enshrines in law the 
Brussels doctrine of the ‘right to be forgotten’, which says people 
should not be damaged by discussion of their mistakes or misjudgments in
 the distant past.

The ruling by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice yesterday provoked a wave of anger in Britain.

Both
 privacy and freedom of expression watchdogs said it was a threat to 
free speech – condemning efforts to allow people to ‘whitewash their 
personal history’.

Influential
 Tory Eurosceptic MP Dominic Raab added: ‘This ruling is a draconian 
attack on free speech and transparency, totally at odds with Britain’s 
liberal tradition.

‘It 
highlights the increasingly authoritarian dimension to the EU, which 
threatens basic freedoms we have long taken for granted.’

The judgment came as an unwelcome surprise to ministers who have opposed EU moves to establish a ‘right to be forgotten’.

The
 Government had been led to believe the European Court of Justice would 
reject yesterday’s case when an adviser to judges last year said 
suppressing content in the public domain would affect the ‘freedom of 
expression’ of web publishers.

But
 yesterday a board of 13 judges ruled that information could be 
suppressed even if it was ‘true, accurate and lawfully published’.

The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy. Google told MailOnline it is 'disappointed' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index

In June 2013, an adviser to EU’s highest court said that Google should not have to remove personal information from its search results, even if that information is damaging to a person's reputation.

The statement was made by by Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen and was seen as a major blow against the 'right to be forgotten' campaign. 

Jääskinen said: 'Requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression.

'Search engine service providers are not responsible, on the basis of the data protection directive, for personal data appearing on web pages they process.'

They
 found in favour of Spanish citizen Mario Costeja Gonzalez, who had 
demanded that Google block  links to newspaper reports dating back to 
1998 about his social  security debts.

Mr Gonzalez told the court that the proceedings concerning him had been ‘fully resolved for a number of years’.

Judges
 said he had a right to suppress the information under a 1995 EU data 
protection directive and the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, adding 
that his rights to privacy ‘override, as a general rule, the interest of
 internet users’.

Google was
 held responsible because, the judges decided, even though it is a 
US-based corporation, it has local sales offices in Spain.

The
 search giant said yesterday: ‘This is a disappointing ruling for search
 engines and online publishers in general. We now need to take time to 
analyse the implications.’

European
 Commission vice-president Viviane Reding, who is trying to persuade EU 
nations to adopt a formal directive on the right to be forgotten, said 
the decision was a victory for privacy and would mean people could now 
‘manage their data’.

‘Companies can no longer hide behind their servers being based in California or anywhere else in the world,’ she said.

Emma
 Carr of Big Brother Watch said: ‘The principle that you have a right to
 be forgotten is a laudable one, but it was never intended to be a way 
for people to rewrite history.’

Index
 on Censorship added: ‘It allows individuals to complain to search 
engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight.

‘This
 is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. 
Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the 
door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history.’
