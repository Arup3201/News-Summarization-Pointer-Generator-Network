One mother brought new meaning to sweet dreams for her baby boy, creating adorable photographs of her sleeping son going on enchanting adventures.

Artist and mother-of-three Queenie Liao would wait until Wengenn fell asleep before quietly creating an imaginary fairy tale scene behind him to take these delightful photographs in California.

While the baby slept, he was photographed travelling to castles in the clouds, cooking eggs in the kitchen or swinging on the trapeze with an elephant to catch him.

Sweet dreams: Baby Wengenn sleeps soundly and while he does his mother Queenie Liao creates fairy tale scenes around him to take adorable photographs

The photographs have captivated people around the world with their cute creativity made out of different coloured material, soft toys and other household items.

Drawing inspiration from famous child photographer Anne Geddes and mother Adele Enersen who published a book of similar photographs, Ms Liao decided to turn her photography hobby toward her son. A love of fairy tales also helped her create the enchanting photo series.

According to BoredPanda.org, she said: ‘Everyday just before Wengenn’s nap, I would imagine him being the main character in one of my favourite episodes and “paint” a background setting with plain clothes, stuffed animals, and other common household materials, just like how an artist would with her paint brushes.

‘After Wengenn fell asleep, I would place him at the centre of the theme I’d created and start taking pictures.’

One photograph with Wengenn as an angel with the words ‘wishes for Japan’ was intended as well wishes for the victims of the tsunami and earthquake in the country.

With a collection of more than one hundred photographs of Wengenn’s night-time adventures, Ms Liao published a book in Chinese in Taiwan last year titled ‘Sleepy Baby’.

Ms Liao said: ‘The book provides step-by-step details of how some of those pictures were taken, as well as how other art crafts can be made out of baby pictures.’

There are plans for an English version to also be published.

She told her fans: ‘I’m truly touched by your overwhelming support.’
