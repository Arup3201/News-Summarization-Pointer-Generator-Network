Olympic champion Luke Campbell is relishing the opportunity to resume his professional career on July 12.

Campbell, the bantamweight gold medallist at London 2012, had compiled a perfect 5-0 record, with four stoppages, since switching to the paid ranks last year but he has recently taken time out for family reasons.

The Hull southpaw will be back in action on the undercard to Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly's bouts at the Echo Arena in Liverpool and will face Welshman Craig Woodruff in a six-round bout.

Return: Luke Campbell will make his professional comeback against Craig Woodruff after taking time out

Champion: Campbell won Olympic gold in London in 2012 and turned professional soon after

'It has been five months or more and I am looking forward to getting back in the ring,' said Campbell.

'The break has given me a good opportunity to spend time with my family and I have always been in the gym ticking over and working on certain things.

'Now everything is steady and good everybody in the family wants to see me back in the ring and doing what I do best.'
