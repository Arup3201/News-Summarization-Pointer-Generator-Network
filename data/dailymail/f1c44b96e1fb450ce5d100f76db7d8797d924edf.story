Australia's British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard faces a shootout against her former foreign minister Kevin Rudd after he challenged her leadership.

But Miss Gillard is convinced she has the support of the Labour Party to see off Mr Rudd - the man she ousted for the top job in 2010.

Mr Rudd resigned as Foreign Minister on Tuesday while he was in Washington, raising speculation that he would challenge Miss Gillard when her cabinet meets on Monday.

Confident: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she will hold a ballot for the Labour Party leadership on Monday

Kevin Rudd confirmed today he will challenge Julia Gillard for the Labor leadership on Monday

A recent poll shows Mr Rudd is preferred as prime minister by 57 per cent of voters compared with 35 per cent for Ms Gillard.

In October, Mr Rudd led by 61 per cent to 30 per cent.

About one-quarter of those who back Mr Rudd do not believe he should run for the leadership.

Mr Rudd then declined to confirm whether he will take on 50-year-old Miss Gillard, before confirming he will today.

He said: 'And starting on Monday, I want to start restoring that trust. Thatâ€™s why I've decided to contest the leadership of the Australian Labor Party.

'I want to finish the job the Australian people elected me to do when I was elected by them to become prime minister.'

The PM had said she will hold a ballot
for the Labour Party leadership on Monday in any case to end all the 
speculation over who is the best person to hold the the top job - a 
debate that has been damaging the party according to opinion polls.

Miss Gillard, who arrived in Australia
with her parents from Barry, in Wales, when she was five, said yesterday: 
'Australians are rightly sick of this. We need a leadership ballot to 
settle this question once and for all.'

She added that she expected Mr Rudd 
would be a candidate in the ballot - but was confident that not only 
would she win it, but would go on to win the next general election due 
next year.

Refusal: Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister in June 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the Labor Party in recent weeks over the leadership

Announcement: Mr Rudd declared his resignation at a press conference in Washington DC, saying he could not continue without Ms Gillard's support

She said: 'I am confident that...we 
can win that election provided we use Monday's opportunity to end this 
for all time and then we get on with the job of delivering good 
government for the Australian people.

Mr Rudd, 54, has been a thorn in Miss 
Gillard's side since she gathered enough support to oust him from the 
Prime Minister's job two years ago as he slumped in the opinion polls 
against the Liberal - Australia's conservative - Party.

As Miss Gillard's popularity also 
began to slide in the opinion polls, Mr Rudd is understood to have 
indicated to people close to him that he would try to get his old job 
back.

Miss Gillard appointed him as her 
Foreign Minister when she took over, but it was in Washington at a snap 
news conference that he announced his resignation from the position.

Unhappy union: Recent polls suggest their ongoing battle has been damaging the Labour Party

Before leaving Washington, where he 
had met US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, Mr Rudd told reporters 
that some of his colleagues had told him that they regarded him 'as the 
best prospect to lead the Australian Labour Party successfully to the 
next elections'.

Despite Miss Gillard's conviction that
she has the support to thwart any leadership challenge by Mr Rudd, 
former Attorney-General Robert McClelland stepped forward today to 
declare his support for Mr Rudd.

He said: 'He's our best prospect to win the next federal election.'

But Labour Senator Mark Arbib used virtually the same words to lend his support to Miss Gillard, saying she was 'the best person to lead the country and win the next federal election for Labour'.
