A London penthouse with a cinema, gym, massage room and six garden terraces has been put on the rental market for an eye-watering £50,000 a week.

Described as 'spectacular and rare' the six-bedroom apartment in Wellington Court is located in desirable Knightsbridge and offers views over Hyde Park.

The 'boutique hotel' style bedrooms each have their own en suite bathrooms while there is a grand reception room, library and a separate dining room with bar and study area.

A 'spectacular and rare' penthouse regarded as one of the finest in London has been put on the rental market for a staggering £50,000 a week

It also features a jacuzzi room and six garden terraces, all boasting panoramic views.

There is 9,000 sq.ft of interior space while the terraces, measuring a total of 2,000 sq.ft, is the equivalent of two new build homes.

The anonymous owner of the flat has now decided to try and take advantage of London’s buoyant rental market by leasing it out to a billionaire.

Fully furnished and ready to be lived in, the penthouse went on the market on Friday for a record-breaking £50,000 per week.

Over a month, the tenant will be paying £216,667 while a year in the luxury penthouse stands at £2.6 million.

Wellington Court was put on rental market with a number of estate agents this week including Strutt and Parker, which described it as 'spectacular'.

Charlie Willis, from Strutt and Parker, said: 'It is very rare to find a property of this square footage on one floor with the addition of 2,000s sq/ft terrace overlooking Hyde Park.

'The interior is stylish and almost feels like a luxury boat, it is very elaborate. It is one of the finest positions in London and has sensational views.'
