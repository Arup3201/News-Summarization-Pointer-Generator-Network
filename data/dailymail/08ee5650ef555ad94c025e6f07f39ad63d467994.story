This is the moment a British 'freerunner' scaled the top of a bridge and performed a back-flip while hundreds of feet in the air.

James Kingston, who describes himself as a 'professional adventurer', climbed 380 feet to the top of the Moscow Bridge in Kiev along with friend Mustang Wanted.

The pair are then seen dangling each other over the edge of the bridge, before the nail biting footage shows Mr Kingston do a back flip without wearing any safety gear.

But the stunt doesn't quite go to plan, not because he lands badly, but because after making his descent from the bridge, he falls right into the arms of local police who arrest him.

The footage starts with the pair climbing the 380 feet to the top of the Moscow Bridge, not seeming to use any sort of safety equipment.

Mr Kingston is then seen scaling the metal beams to reach the top platform, where he and his friend dangle over the edge - where one slip could cause the other to fall to certain death.

Don't look down: Okay, do look down and see the concrete and cars below

In the footage, Mr Kingstonscales the metal cables to reach the top platform, where he then performs a back-flip

Mr Kingston then completes the back flip on top of the platform, nailing his landing.

But as the pair climb down, sirens can be heard and the police are waiting for them.

They try to tell the officers that they are photographers and are just taking pictures of the panoramic views of Kiev.

Test of friendship: Kingston holds his friend over the side, allowing him to dangle freely in a stomach-churning image

One small step: Kingston prepares to perform a somersault atop the bridge

Ready to jump: Kingston bends down as he prepares to jump

Mid-air: Kingston performs the stomach-churning somersault atop one of the bridges 377ft pylons

Taking it all in: Kingston calls himself a professional adventurer, although there doesn't appear to be much professionalism in his stunts

But despite landing his back flip, his stunt didn't quite go to plan when he climbs back down

Waiting reception: Kingston made his way carefully down the side of the bridge to a bunch of cops were were waiting to question him

The Moscow Bridge in Kiev, which Mr Kingston scaled, crosses the Dnieper River

But when one officers asks why they were doing somersaults, one of them replies, 'because he is the English Spider-Man.'

The video, which is recorded by the pair then ends showing them sitting in the back of a police vehicle.

Mr Kingston has scaled several large structures around the world and has uploaded videos of himself carrying out the stunts on his Youtube channel.
