The White House, Members of Congress and the international community reacted swiftly, but with varying levels of intensity, on Wednesday after reports from Syria indicated that the Bashar al-Assad regime had killed at least 1,300 people with a chemical weapons attack.

While the White House held its cards close to the vest, some in Congress were quick to blame the Obama administration for inviting genocide through a weak posture abroad.

There are 'no consequences for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line,' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said in a tweet. 'We shouldn't be surprised he's using them again.'

The 'red line' comment refers to comments President Obama made a year ago, promising that the use of chemical weapons against Syrian rebels would bring a game-changing shift in U.S. posture toward Assad's often brutal regime.

'We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground,' Obama said on August 20, 2012, 'that a red line for us is [if] we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.'

However, at an afternoon press conference the White House continued to deflect demands that it must take unilateral action against the regime.

'This is and should be a top priority of the United Nations,' said Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest in a briefing with journalists.

The UN Security Council has scheduled a 3:00 p.m. emergency meeting to debate a response, but Russia - Syria's principal ally - can veto any proposal.

But 'there is work,' Earnest insisted, 'that can be done with our international partners to try to continue to pressure the Assad regime.'

'Those that are responsible for the use of chemical weapons -- if it's determined that that's what happened -- will be held accountable,' he said.

But when reporters pressed Earnest on whether President Obama is 'willing to use the stick along with the rhetoric' on Syria, he quipped that it was 'a philosophical question which I think is a legitimate one.'

'It might be better answered by the Commander-in-Chief himself.'

A reporter then asked, 'Are you going to bring him out?'

Earnest
 refused to speculate on whether the U.S. actions to date have caused 
Assad to feel enough pressure to consider ceding power to a 
democratically elected government.

'There
 are a range of consequences' that the administration has sought, he 
said. 'It's hard for me to speak to whether or not he [Assad] feels 
threatened.'

But he 
acknowledged that 'steady escalation of aid that has been provided to 
the Syrian opposition,' along with humanitarian aid and negotiations 
with the international community, ... 'has not resulted in the outcome 
that we would like to see, which is the complete removal of Assad from 
power.'

Earnest 
dismissed a similar question about whether there was a 'red line' that 
Egypt's military rulers had crossed by killing more than 1,000 
pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters in Cairo.

'I didn't bring my red pen out here with me today,' he said.

Earnest
 insisted that a UN inspection team, which has been on the ground in 
Syria since Tuesday, should be allowed to investigate the sites of 
alleged chemical weapons use before the U.S. or any other country mounts
 an organized response.

'We think it's important for that investigative team to be given access to that area,' he said.

He
 would not comment, however, on whether or not a 'red line' would be 
crossed if the Assad government interferes with that investigation or 
refuses to grant the UN team access to critical sites, including those 
shown in videos that circulated online Wednesday.

Russia, too, has urged an 'objective' investigation into the footage and reports.

Russian
 President Vladimir Putin remains Assad's most powerful ally, in part 
because Syria hosts its last remaining naval base on the Mediterranean 
Sea.

But Reuters reported Wednesday afternoon that Russia's Foreign Ministry has claimed pro-democracy rebels in Syria may have staged the attack in order to provoke international reactions against Assad.

On Jan. 31, Russia and China blocked Security Council plan demanding that Assad hand over power to his deputy and allow a general election, and promising unspecified 'further measures' if he did not comply.

Turkey, meanwhile, castigated the Assad regime for employing 'unacceptable violence' against his own people, according to a translation provided to MailOnline.

'If the allegations are true,' said the statement from the country's foreign affairs minister, it would constitute 'a crime against humanity'

In an earlier statement today, Earnest said the administration was 'deeply concerned' by the news filtering out of Syria, and called on the UN to investigate further.

'The United States strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons' Earnest said in a statement. 'Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable.'

'Today, we are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. The UN investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate.'

If it's established conclusively that the chemical attacks did occur near Damascus, as rebel groups have alleged, they would have been carried out while the UN inspectors were on the ground nearby.

Syria, meanwhile, has said via its state-controlled media that there is no truth to the accounts.
