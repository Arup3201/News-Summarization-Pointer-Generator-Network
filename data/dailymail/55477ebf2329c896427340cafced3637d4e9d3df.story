Mercedes have unveiled a monstrous new rugged off-roader with six wheels - their first since a similar model was produced for the Nazis in 1930s Germany.

The outrageous Mercedes G63 AMG 6x6 is a limited edition model based on the iconic G-Wagon.

It has been designed to have the off-road capabilities of a tank, accelerate like a hot hatch and provide the luxury feel of a limousine.

Monster: The Mercedes G63 AMG 6x6 is a limited edition model based on the iconic G-Wagon

Acceleration: Mercedes has replaced the standard G Wagon's 3-litre diesel engine with a twin-turbocharged 5.5-litre V8

Suitable: Mercedes claims the vehicle can negotiate rocky ground with 'all the agility of a mountain goat'

Size: The behemoth of a vehicle measures 19ft in length and weighs 3.85 tons

To give it brutal acceleration, Mercedes has replaced the standard G Wagon's 3-litre diesel engine with a twin-turbocharged 5.5-litre V8.

The result is a 536bhp behemoth which is capable of 0-62mph in less than six seconds - despite measuring 19ft in length, weighing 3.85 tons.

Mercedes claims the 6x6 - which has 37 inch wheels - can negotiate rocky terrain with 'all the agility of a mountain goat', while fording a river is 'almost child's play'.

They add: 'Anyone exploring the on-road performance is certain to be impressed by the catapult-like acceleration of this 3.85-tonne pickup.'

However, the 6x6 comes with a massive £350,000 price-tag - making it the most expensive model in the Mercedes range and three-times as pricey as a typical G Wagon.

The off-roader, which is likely to be most popular in the Middle-East, will be limited to around 30 sales per year.

Power: The 6x6 has 563bhp and is capable of 0-62mph in less than six seconds

Interior: The off-roader comes with a massive £350,000 price-tag

The new model is not the first six-wheel off-roader from the German firm, with Hitler owning eight during the Third Reich.

The G4 was a heavy-duty off-road car Mercedes produced for the German army between 1934 and 1939.

Mercedes built 57 G4s during this period with heads of state and top military brass regarding them as a 'prestige all-terrain vehicle'.

Not the first: The G4 was a heavy-duty off-road car Mercedes produced for the German army between 1934 and 1939

Modern: Unlike the new Mercedes G63 AMG (pictured) however, the G4 wasn't six-wheel drive with power only sent to the rear four wheels

Rare: It is understood there are just three G4 models in existence which are absolutely authentic although other models have been rebuilt

Hitler was a huge fan and had eight of the six-wheeled cars, with a number located at his various castles around Germany.

However, unlike the new Mercedes G63 AMG, the G4 wasn't six-wheel drive with power only sent to the rear four wheels.

It is understood there are just three models in existence which are absolutely authentic although other models have been rebuilt. One of these models is owned by the Spanish royal family after Hitler gave it to General Franco in 1939.

Costly: The G63 AMG 6x6 is the most expensive model in the Mercedes range and three-times as pricey as a typical G Wagon

In control: Mercedes claim fording a river in the 6x6, which has 37 inch wheels, is 'almost child's play'

New: A Mercedes spokesman said, 'Anyone exploring the on-road performance is certain to be impressed by the catapult-like acceleration of this 3.85-tonne pickup'
