Having presided over only 13 competitive matches during his first four months in charge, Louis van Gaal has now embarked on a demanding run of nine games in 36 days that will shape his debut season at Manchester United.

The fixtures come thick and fast with Stoke City next at Old Trafford on Tuesday and the Dutchman has some big decisions to make — most notably whether Robin van Persie should keep his place with Radamel Falcao available once again.

For a manager who has based his entire coaching career on careful preparation, Van Gaal is critical of the heavily lopsided fixture list.

‘I’m not happy but I cannot change it,’ Van Gaal said. ‘I don’t agree with it because I don’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days. In December, it shall be like that.

Former Manchester United fans’ favourite Steve Bruce has failed to beat his old club in 21 attempts as a manager.

‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas.

'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’

At least United go into their hectic period in a Champions League spot after a run of one defeat in eight games.

Manchester United face a busy Christmas schedule which could well define their season

Their injury situation has been downgraded from chronic to poor even though Angel di Maria tweaked a hamstring and will have to sit out the Stoke game alongside Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael and Phil Jones, while Wayne Rooney, James Wilson and Jonny Evans have to be assessed.

Rooney hobbled off at full-time after kicks to his calf and knee but has told his manager he is ready to play.

On the plus side, Michael Carrick, Marcos Rojo and Falcao all returned from injuries with the return of the £265,000-a-week Colombian presenting Van Gaal with a major selection dilemma.

Van Persie responded to recent criticism by setting up United’s second goal for Rooney and then scoring a fine third himself, though Van Gaal insisted the striker’s all-round performance could still improve.

Van Gaal is anxious to see what Falcao can do with United as he has to decide by April whether to sign the Monaco loanee on a permanent basis.

‘Because I played with two strikers on Saturday I needed Falcao on the bench,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But it was not normal because he was not fit to play 90 minutes but for 20 minutes. Now, I can use him because he has trained for a full week with the first team.’

Defender Chris Smalling, who scored United’s first goal, revealed that Van Gaal has made his intentions clear.

‘He asked for six points as a must from these two home games and we’re going to deliver that on Tuesday,’ said Smalling. ‘Confidence is good with our form at Old Trafford. We’ll be coming out firing again.’

Hull are on the slide. Manager Steve Bruce has seen his team lose their last four games to slip close to the relegation zone with a tough trip to Everton on Wednesday. 

Midfielder Tom Huddlestone, dropped for the visit to Old Trafford, remarked on Twitter that Hull had shown United too much respect. It will be interesting to see if he returns at Goodison.

‘I just thought he could sit out (United), freshen him up a bit. Let’s hope it works,’ said Bruce.‘He’s not hit the heights he hit last year but then he set an unbelievable standard. Tom Huddlestone will come again.’
