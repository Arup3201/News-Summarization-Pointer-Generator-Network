This is the moment two 'remorseful' thugs laughed and punched the air with joy after being spared prison for beating a man unconscious.

Corey Savory and Thomas Vernon were let off with suspended jail sentences by a judge who had heard they were full of remorse for the unprovoked late night assault.

The pair, both 23, were sombre in the dock during their sentencing hearing and Savory appeared to be in tears at times.

However, the North Yorkshire men showed no signs of being sorry for their actions as they gave two thumbs up  and celebrated wildly on the steps of Teesside Crown Court after the hearing.

The pair, both 23, were each handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months with supervision and ordered to pay £100 compensation after the judge said they showed 'genuine remorse'

The pair were each handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months with supervision, and ordered to pay £100 compensation to the victim after the judge said they showed 'genuine remorse' for the attack on March 30 last year.

The court heard how the pair targeted the victim, who was unknown to them, as he smoked and waited for a friend outside a pub on Redcar high street.

The victim was struck in the face before the pair ran off towards Savory's home, which was also in the high street. The victim followed and repeatedly kicked the door, the court heard.

Jenny Haigh, prosecuting, said the victim was shocked, upset and angry at being attacked and wanted to know why he was hit and threatened.

Just seconds later, at about 11.30pm, a third unknown man came up behind the victim and hit him, knocking him to the ground.

Savory and Vernon then attacked him, kicking him in the head until he lost consciousness, the court was told.

Ms Haigh said Savory kicked the victim's torso and both men punched him repeatedly.

The victim suffered a two-inch cut to his forehead, which needed stitches and left a permanent scar – which he described as a 'constant reminder' of the attack.

He said the assault contributed to him losing his job and he feared being attacked again.

As the court was shown CCTV footage of the assault yesterday, Savory put his head in his hands and refused to watch the video.

Both Vernon and Savory admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, but they both denied kicking the victim.

Defence advocates described their behaviour as unacceptable, reprehensible and 'utterly inappropriate'.

Graham Brown, defending Vernon, said he called police in a 'Mexican stand-off' which escalated when the 'random third party' struck the victim.

He said the two men took advantage of the situation in a joint assault which lasted 30 seconds.

He added that Vernon was a single man who was 'petrified' by the court process and said prison would have a 'lifelong impact' on him.

Uzma Khan, defending Savory, said: 'They were provoked into reacting and defending their property.

'That went too far and it was perhaps opportunistic when the victim was lying on the floor. They never set out to cause any injury.'

She said Savory never wanted trouble, tried to defuse the situation and did not expect it to go beyond verbal abuse.

The two men were handed eight-month jail terms, suspended for 18 months with supervision, when they appeared at Teesside Crown Court (pictured). The judge described the attack 'ferocious' and 'unprovoked'

The court heard how Savory claimed the victim made comments to him in the pub earlier in the evening and became the 'aggressor' when the pair retreated to the house.

He was said to be 'utterly remorseful' and willing to consider restorative justice with a direct apology.

He also suffered from depression and there was a risk of self-harm and suicide, the court heard.

The judge, Recorder Sarah Mallett, did not accept that the victim was the aggressor.

She told the pair: 'You could simply have returned to your home, shut the door and stayed there.

'You could and should have retreated back inside. But you didn't do that.

'This was a ferocious attack by two men who had the advantage of having their victim put on the ground for them by a third party.

'He was already on the floor and he wasn't doing anything provocative. They are nasty injuries.'
