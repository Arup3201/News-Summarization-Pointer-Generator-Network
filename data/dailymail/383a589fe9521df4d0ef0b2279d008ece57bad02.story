Severely disabled Jade Norton, aged 10, from Blackpool in Lancashire, was given the £2,600 BaKare Klearside bed to stop her rolling out at night

The NHS is facing a criminal trial over the death of a severely disabled ten-year-old girl who fell out of a faulty bed and was suffocated by a plastic sheet.

Jade Norton, aged 10, from Blackpool in Lancashire, was given the £2,600 BaKare Klearside bed to stop her rolling out at night if she suffered a seizure.

She suffered from Rett Syndrome, a rare disorder which impacts on breathing and movement.

Just days before her 11th birthday in June 2011 she suffered a fit during the night and fell from the bed because the barrier to stop her falling out was broken and had not been fixed.

Her parents claim they put in four requests in with the NHS and their care providers over a six week period asking for the bed to be fixed, but were ignored. 

They also say the bed was not serviced in four years.

Three years after the tragedy health bosses have finally apologised and paid undisclosed compensation as part of a civil case.

But yesterday criminal proceedings were launched by the Health and Safety Authority against NHS Litigation Limited and Jade's carers, Interserve Healthcare.

Jade's mother Amanda, 42, a support worker said: 'At the end of the day an innocent girl has died.

'She would still be here if it was not for the faults.

'I hope that we get the truth. I know nothing will bring her back but people need to be made more aware of what has happened so it never happens again.

'It is justice for Jade. My little girl has lost her life - I do not want it to happen to anyone again.'

Her father Lee, a graphic designer, noticed the bed's barrier was faulty but claims his complaints were ignored.

He was the one to find his daughter's lifeless body beneath a plastic sheet on the floor.

Mr Norton, 41, said: 'I thought she was asleep - but then I noticed she was blue. I just howled.'

Rett syndrome is a rare chromosome condition that only affects girls. 

The disease usually strikes youngsters when they have learned to walk or talk. 

Over time the disease drags a girl's progression backwards so they lose their new skills and are left unable to communicate. 

Most girls with Rett syndrome reach adulthood but lose their motor skills. 

The syndrome is most often caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation and can occur in any family at any time. 

It affects around 1 in 12,000 live female births.

There is no current treatment for the condition but there are hopes of finding a cure. 

The condition also affected Coleen Rooney's little sister who died in January 2013. 

Sufferers can live to their 40s and some have been known to live to their 70s. 

People do not die of Rett Syndrome but of complications that can appear with it such as epilepsy or pneumonia

Mrs Norton added: 'Lee screamed. I started CPR to try to resuscitate her while Lee rang for an ambulance.

'I would hate to go through it again.' 

Today Mrs Norton demanded justice for her daughter.

She said: 'Nothing will bring her back but people need to be made more aware of what has happened so it never happens again.'

The NHS faces one allegation of failing in its duty of care to Jade in relation to the supply of a prescription bed at her home.

Care provision company Interserve Health Care - formerly known as Advantage Health Care - faces two allegations of exposing Jade to risk through their delivery of nursing and personal care.

Jennifer Maloney of Slater Gordon law firm confirmed the civil settlement had been agreed and an apology received by the family.

A letter to the family from Richard Jones of NHS England, said: 'I do appreciate that no apology I can make will be adequate in these circumstances, but I am truly sorry.'

NHS Litigation Ltd spokesman said: 'Any criminal liabilities of former PCTs were passed to the NHS Litigation Authority by Transfer Orders when PCTs were abolished.' 

Interserve Healthcare declined to comment.
