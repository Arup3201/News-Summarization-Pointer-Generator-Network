Hospitals will no longer be able to profit simply by putting dying patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway.

NHS trusts have been receiving six-figure sums for using the controversial end-of-life regime.

But care minister Norman Lamb said these ‘bribes’ would have to stop unless it was shown suffering had been reduced.

It is feared the incentives pressure doctors to use the pathway even when a patient’s life may not be nearing its end.

Hospitals will no longer be able to reap financial bonuses by putting patients on the Liverpool Care Pathway, a scheme that governs the treatment of the seriously ill. File picture

Freedom of Information requests show Aintree University Hospitals Trust, in Liverpool, received £308,000 last year for achieving ‘goals including the Liverpool Care Pathway’. Part of the money was tied to it achieving an LCP figure of 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent.

Salford Royal NHS Trust had LCP-linked payments halved for failing to hit targets.

Mr Lamb, who has commissioned a review of the pathway, said payments should be made only if it can be demonstrated that individual patients have experienced reduced suffering as a direct result of being placed on the LCP.

‘If incentives are given just to add someone to a list, that seems to be of concern,’ he said. ‘I want the issue of payments to be looked at in the review, but in the meantime, let’s ensure we only pay incentives when it can really be demonstrated that care at the end of life is being improved.’

Every year 130,000 people are placed on the pathway, which aims to ease suffering. It usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs, and in some cases the removal of tubes providing nutrition and fluids.

Yesterday Mr Lamb named health expert Julia Neuberger as chairman of the independent review. Her inquiry will make recommendations about any changes needed to ensure patients are always treated with dignity and that they and their families are involved in decision-making.

It will look at the experience and 
opinions of patients and families; the experience and opinions of health
 professionals; complaints against hospitals; local payments made to 
hospitals in respect of LCP; and the literature about the benefits and 
limitations of the pathway.

Baroness Neuberger, former chief executive of the King’s Fund health think-tank, used to sit in the Lords as a Lib Dem but is now a crossbencher and is also a senior rabbi to the West London Synagogue.

She said: ‘How we care for people at the end of their lives is a reflection of our society’s values and civilisation.

Mr Lamb called some aspects of the LCP, such as patients not getting food and drink, 'deeply disturbing'

‘At its best, Britain leads the world in end-of-life care, but it is not always perfect, and we need to work hard to get it right for everyone, providing the personal care individuals and their families both want and need.’

Mr Lamb said: ‘She will be scrupulously independent and she brings a faith perspective to the consideration of this.

‘She will be supported by a panel of people; independent experts and other people from faith perspectives. There is deep concern, for example, among the Roman Catholic perspective.’

The Lib Dem minister said there would be a specific session of the review which would question families about their experiences. Medical experts – both those for and against – would also appear.

He said: ‘I have been deeply troubled by some of the stories that have been reported to me about the experiences in some hospitals. It is impossible to know the scale.

‘I am deeply concerned about the apparent misapplication of Liverpool Care Pathway guidelines in some hospitals.

‘Why it is that in many hospitals, patients are being denied food or drink, even though the guidelines say this should not happen? It is deeply disturbing and needs to be properly understood and investigated.

‘I will act on any rational conclusions that come from the review. We have the chance to get to a great conclusion, where we can genuinely improve the quality of care at the end of life.

‘It is critical that food and drink is not withdrawn, unless to give food and drink would cause unnecessary suffering. I have heard stories of people who are compos mentis being denied liquids – and this is deeply disturbing.’

One leading critic of the LCP, hospital consultant Professor Patrick Pullicino, attacked incentive payments last year.

He said: ‘Given the fact that the diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one, putting a financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea.’
