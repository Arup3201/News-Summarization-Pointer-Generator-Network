A bluefin tuna sold for a record £1.09million at a Tokyo auction today, nearly three times the previous high set last year.

The fish's tender pink and red meat is 
prized for sushi and sashimi - and the best slices, known as 'o-toro', can sell for £14 (2,000 yen) per piece at upmarket Japanese
sushi bars.

Caught off the country's northeastern coast, the 222kg (489lb) tuna was sold at the first auction of the year at Tokyo's sprawling Tsukiji fish market, said market official Ryoji Yagi.

That means the price for this year's whopper works out at a stunning £2,230 per pound.

The news comes as environmentalists warn that 
stocks of the majestic, speedy fish are being depleted worldwide amid 
strong demand for sushi.

Japanese eat 80 per cent of the bluefin tuna caught worldwide, and much the global catch is shipped there for consumption. 

The winning bidder, Kiyoshi Kimura, president of Kiyomura Co., which operates the Sushi-Zanmai restaurant chain, said 'the price was a bit high' but that he wanted to 'encourage Japan', according to Kyodo News agency.

The massive catch is being served to his customers this evening.

Kimura also set the old record of £430,000 for a bluefin tuna at last year's New Year's auction, which tends to attract high bids as a celebratory way to kick off the new year - or get some publicity.

But the high prices don't necessarily reflect exceptionally high fish quality. 

Stocks of all three bluefin species - the Pacific, Southern and Atlantic - have fallen over the past 15 years amid overfishing.

The bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world.

On average, it measures 6.5ft in length and weighs 550lb, although much larger specimens are not uncommon.

Its torpedo-shaped, streamlined body is built for speed and endurance.

In appearance, they are metallic blue on top and silver-white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below.

Bluefin meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels.

It has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the Japanese eat 80 per cent of the Atlantic and Pacific bluefins caught. 

On Monday, an intergovernmental group is to release data on Pacific Bluefin stocks that environmentalists believe will likely show an alarming decline.

'Everything we're hearing is that there's no good news for the Pacific Bluefin,' said Amanda Nickson, director of the Washington-based Pew Environmental Group's global tuna conservation campaign.

'We're seeing a very high value fish continue to be overfished.'

The population of another species, the Southern Bluefin, which swims in the southern Pacific, has plunged to 3 to 8 per cent of its original levels.

Stocks of bluefin caught in the Atlantic and Mediterranean plunged by 60 per cent between 1997 and 2007 due to rampant, often illegal, overfishing and lax quotas.

Although there has been some improvement in recent years, experts say the outlook for the species is still fragile.

In November, the 48 member nations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, or ICCAT, voted to maintain strict catch limits on the species, although some countries argued for higher limits.

The quota will be allowed to rise slightly from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500.

The fish's tender pink and red meat is prized for sushi and sashimi - and the best slices, known as 'o-toro', can sell for £14 (2,000 yen) per piece at upmarket Japanese sushi bars

Quotas were as high as 32,000 tons in 2006.

A total catch limit on the Pacific Bluefin has been imposed only recently in the eastern part of the Pacific near the United States and Mexico, but not by the intergovernmental group that oversees the western Pacific, Nickson said.

So-called effort limits in place now - restrictions on the number of vessels and days fishing allowed - are not effective, she added, and fisherman also are targeting juvenile populations and spawning grounds.

'This poor species is being hit from every angle,' she said.
