This is filmmaker Costis Mitsotakis - the only man in a Spanish village who didn't win a share of a £600million lottery prize because he forgot to buy a ticket.

When the residents of Sodeto's number came up on the Christmas mega draw - called El Gordo or the Big One - they danced down the street in the conga.

But Mr Mitsotakis wasn't celebrating - because when community leaders went round the 70 houses in their remote community collecting money for tickets they missed him off.

World's unluckiest man: Costis Mitsotakis is the only person in Sodeto who did not win a share of the El Gordo Christmas lottery jackpot after he didn't buy a ticket

Jackpot joy: The people of Granen celebrate winning the Christmas lottery in Spain by doing the Conga. The winning tickets were all bought in the small town and the surrounding villages including Sodeto which has around 70 houses

A share in a single ticket - or a 'participation' would have cost him £4 and would have won him an £83,000 prize.

The Greek national moved to the area 
after falling in love with a woman. When 
the relationship fell apart he stayed in the area and has been 
renovating a barn.

However, Mr Mitsotakis did not lose out entirely as the day after the Christmas draw was made a neighbour agreed to use their winnings to buy a plot of land he had been trying to sell.

The Spanish lottery El Gordo - the Fat One - has a total of 1,800 winning tickets. Each ticket costs around £16 but it is sub-divided into four participations which cost around £4 each.

Each one of the residents bought a ticket bearing the first prize winning number 58,268 - except for Mr Mitsotakis.

Rejoice: Each share of a ticket in Granen which won was worth £83,000. The lottery El Gordo - the Fat One - takes place in Spain every year just before Christmas

While some people won £83,000 after buying a single share, other villagers won millions.

In total, the people of Sodeto received around £100million of the £600million money for the 'first prize tickets'. The rest of the £600million fund went to people in the town of Granen nearby and neighbouring villages.

The village, in northern Spain, is around three hours by car from Barcelona on the coast.

José Manuel Penella Cambra's wife bought two participations and his son discovered two more which he had forgotten he had bought. In total, the family netted in the region of £372,000.

The homeowner joked to the New York Times: 'I kept saying: look for some more, look for some more.'

El Gordo: The big Christmas lottery has taken place since 1812 - and the average Spaniard spends £47 on tickets. It is so popular people take the day off work to watch the draw

'But this money means that now we can breathe. And the best part is that it isn’t just me. Everybody won.'

Sodeto, which has around 250 residents, has been inundated with travelling salesmen and bankers hoping to persuade the wealthy villagers to part with their winnings.

The annual El Gordo lottery has been 
running since 1812 and is so popular that some people take the day off 
work to watch the morning draw.

The homemakers association in Sodeto organise the sale of tickets for the draw every year.

Although a single participation costs £4, the area has been so badly hit by the recession that some people were struggling to come up with the money.

The average Spaniard spent £47 on tickets despite the severe economic crisis and record unemployment.

The lottery gives out 1,800 first prizes for each whole ticket split into four participations of £332,000, 1,800 prizes of £100,000, 1,800 third prizes of £41,600 and thousands of smaller cash prizes.

Around £50 million of the takings go to charities including the Red Cross.
