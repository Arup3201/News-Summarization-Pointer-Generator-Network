A grandmother was given the fright of her life when her grandchildren pranked her into thinking she was about to be attacked by a shark.

The woman was filmed by her giggling relatives as she visited an interactive aquarium at the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., apparently unaware it was actually a pre-recorded video.

After tapping the glass of the aquarium several times - the grandmother turns to the camera bewildered.

Then, one final tap sees the 'shark' make a a quick about turn and smash into the glass, cracking it- and sending the petrified woman hurtling backwards with a scream.

The Museum features an interactive virtual shark attack display in the 'Earth Redesigned' portion of the 'Exquisitely Evil: 50 Years of Bond Villains' exhibit.
