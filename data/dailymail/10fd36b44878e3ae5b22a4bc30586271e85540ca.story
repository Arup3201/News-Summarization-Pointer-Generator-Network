U.S Marines were up in arms when a 2011 decree banned them from rolling the sleeves of their desert uniforms up – but now they’re getting ready to roll again, because army chiefs have done an about-face on the policy.

Marines have long regarded the rolled-sleeve look as a point of pride as it marked them out from other divisions in the armed forces. It also allowed them to show off their muscles.

Dislike of the ban was so widespread and vocal that the head of the Marines finally caved in and announced on Wednesday that from March 9 they would be allowed to bare arms once more while in non-combat situations.

Approval: The Facebook announcement about the sleeve-roll ban being revoked received over 30,000 likes

General James Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, wrote on the Marines’ official Facebook page: ‘Many of you have let us know how important your identity as a Marine is to you and the Marines you lead.

‘I can't tell you how many times we have been asked the persistent question "Commandant, are we ever going to return to SLEEVES UP?" I've thought a lot about this over the past 2 .5 years; I realize that it's important to you. Sleeves up clearly and visually sets us apart. WE HEAR YOU MARINES!

‘Because of the persistence of you, my Sergeants and Corporals, this evening I am publishing a MARADMIN [Marine Administrative Message] that will return us to SLEEVES UP status when wearing our Desert CAMMIES in non-combat areas. This will take effect on 9 March when we transition to our summer warmer weather uniforms. Get the word out Marines.’

Needless to say, the announcement was greeted with a chorus of approval. At the time of writing it had received 33,350 likes and hundreds of comments.

Some of them revealed the dedication that Marines apply to the rolled-sleeve look.

David Cowdrey Jr wrote: ‘If you didn't spend 20 minutes rolling your sleeves, you did it wrong.’ Justin Carrow replied: ‘20 minutes PER SLEEVE.’

Order: Marines will have to keep their sleeves down in combat situations to prevent sunburn and insect bites

Then John Edmiston issued instructions on how to produce the perfect look: ‘One roll, starch, iron, repeat.’

In fact, according to Wsj.com, there used to be official instructions issued to recruits on how to roll sleeves.

It said: ‘When authorized, utility sleeves will be rolled with the inside out, forming a roll about three inches wide, and terminating at a point about two inches above the elbow.’

Marines will be required to keep their sleeves down in combat to prevent sunburn and insect bites.
