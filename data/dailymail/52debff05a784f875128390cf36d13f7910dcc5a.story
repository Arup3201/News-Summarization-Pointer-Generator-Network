Victoria Evans, who was brutally tortured by her adoptive mother for 20 years, has spoken of her fears about her abuser's release from prison next month.

Eunice 
Spry, 70, from Gloucestershire, will be let out of jail in July and could be rehoused just 
miles from the daughter she so cruelly abused.

Victoria, also from Gloucestershire, today made her first ever television appearance on ITV's This Morning. 'I wish her no harm but I don't want to ever see her again,' she said. 'When I look into her eyes I see so many horrific memories.'

'There have been concerns she'll try and make contact,' she adds.

Eunice
 was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of 26 charges of child 
abuse against her two foster children and Victoria, her adopted daughter. 

Now 28, Victoria spoke of the vile abuse she endured but says she is stronger and happier than ever.

Telling her harrowing story, she said, 'She would force a stick down my throat and would count and count whilst I screamed in agony.

'She would then stand on top of me to stop me from screaming.

'We were always starved -- sometimes for three months at a time. And if she saw we looked too healthy she would make us vomit.' She would then make her daughter consume her own sick..

'She was the same with all of us,' she said referring to her two foster siblings. 'Sometimes she was a bit nicer to one to get us against each other.'

She then told of the guilt and torture she endured when her adoptive mother's biological children were killed in a freak accident.

'A lorry driver was playing with his radio and ploughing into the back of us. I was hanging with broken neck over two dead bodies over me.

'Six months later when I woke up from the coma she said, "Why is it scum like you grace this earth?"

'She then said the devil looks after his own. She the kept me in a wheelchair for four years. If I ever tried to sit up she would push me back in by my jaw.'

Victoria's escape came at the age of 18 when, in her role as nanny to a younger brother, she was allowed out the house.

'People said, "Why have you got strangulation marks?" I didn't want to lie to them. That's when I realised that what was going on at home was not right. These people were being different.'

Eventually she left home and brought charges against Eunice. However, despite the vile abuse, her 
mother had such power over her that Victoria still craved her affection.

'At first my mother was writing letters to me saying, "I love you" and she'd call me "a special daughter". It would rip my heart out.'

Eunice was found guilty of 22 charges, including assault and actual bodily harm.

'I was grieving when first happened,' Victoria admitted. 'I was in shock.'

'Eunice's father died three days into the trial so  there was guilt, guilt, guilt!' she said. 'But I know what I did was right.

'Now, I'm a different person. I've got amazing friends, I'm in a relationship and I've got two gorgeous dogs,' she said in an inspiring show of strength.

'You can always get up, dust yourself and keep going. Don't use your past as an excuse,' she said.

But sadly, Victoria felt there was a 'ridiculous lack of support' for people in her position.

'There are people up that need picking up and helping,' said Victoria. And by raising awareness that's exactly what Victoria is now hoping to do.
