A British grandmother has been reunited with her American pen pal nearly 70 years after she first posted an advert in a New York newspaper looking for a long-distance friendship.

Joyce Vosper was a 15-year-old schoolgirl when she placed an advert in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1947, looking for new friends around the world. 

Eileen Schreiber, 14, from New York, saw the 
notice and responded to the British teenager - with the first of hundreds of letters the pair 
would exchange over the years.

Eileen Shreider, 82, from New York and Joyce Vosper, 83, pictured right,
 from Plymouth, Devon, have been reunited 70 years after they 
began writing to one another as pen pals

Mrs Vosper, now 83, sent the advert after the death of her father William, a fisherman, died in 1945, aged 45.

As their special relationship blossomed, Mrs Shreider, now 82, sent sweets and clothes to her English pen pal as she coped with post-war Britain. 

Their correspondence then continued for decades, as both women married, had children and went through the deaths of their husbands .

Mrs Shreider said: 'We would talk about our everyday life - what we felt about the war. We weren’t as close to the war whereas Joyce was right next to it.

'We explained to our neighbours that there was this family that had nothing, not even a father, and my mother would send out these great big boxes with dresses, candy bars and things hidden in the coats.'

The pair began writing after Mrs Vosper sent an advert into the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper in the US, pictured above, when she was aged 15, asking if the paper could help her find an American pen friend

Mrs Vosper - who is known as Joycey to her friends - originally decided to write to the US after losing her father in 1945.

She said: 'I thought one day I would like to travel and the way to do that was to 
make some friends around the world and to find out what the world was 
like.

'I just wanted to write to 
someone after everything so I wrote to the paper in the hope of finding 
an American pen pal.'

Her letter, addressed to one of the Daily Eagle’s reporters Helen Worth, was printed in full on page 10 of the Monday, March 31 1947 edition.

It read: 'On reading your article in the paper I thought you’d be able to help me to get a pen friend in America.

'My age is 15 and a half years and my hobby is collecting film stars’ pictures. I’m very interested in writing to a friend in the USA. Hoping you will oblige and to hear from you or pen pal soon.'

When Mrs Shreider discovered her pen pal was being raised by a single mother after the death of her father, she asked her family to send things though the post.

Her parents gathered clothing, food and other essentials and posted them to
 England - an act of kindness that Mrs Vosper says she has never forgotten.

From then on, the duo wrote to each other constantly before losing touch for about ten years.

But after the internet was created, Mrs Shreider tracked down Mrs Vosper's brother's email address - with whom she was living at the time.

Mrs Shreider, a former data analyst for IBM, said: 'The computer came in and I started looking for Joyce but I couldn’t remember her married name.

'I started looking on the internet and I sent an email to a man named Colin Launder. It turned out to be Joyce’s brother who she was living with at the time so he put us back in touch.

'That’s the thing that surprised me - I thought she might have decided that she didn’t want to write to me anymore but she did.'

Mrs Vosper, pictured here in 1949 when she was crowned Miss Barbican in Plymouth, wrote to the newspaper when she was grieving over the death of her father, who died in 1945

The pair later met up in America when Mrs Vosper and her daughter Beverley travelled to the US to visit Mrs Shreider.

But this is the first time that Mrs Shreider has visited the home of which Mrs Vosper wrote so vividly during the post-war years.

Mrs Vosper, nee Launder, married a widower, Walter Vosper, at the age of 21 and had two step-daughters and two girls of her own. Mrs Shreider married her husband Ray, to whom she was married for 33 years, and had two daughters and two sons.

When Mr Shreider died in December, and after having open-heart surgery in May, Mrs Shreider finally decided to book a flight to Britain.

The letters writers were in contact for decades but almost lost touch as
 their lives went in different directions. They re-started their 
correspondence when Mrs Shreider looked for Mrs Vosper on the internet -
 and found her brother's email address

Mrs Vosper said: 'I was amazed that 
she came because I was afraid that something would happen - but she’s a 
tough old bird, she really is.

'Life went on and we lost touch for a few years but it was great when we managed to get back in contact in the 90s.

'Eileen was crying. We’ve shared a lot over the years and it’s been so lovely having her here.

'Eileen is just incredible, she had a heart operation before she came out in May and I thought she may not be able to come.

'We’ve had such an amazing time. I’m going to be really sad to see her leave but we’ve had some lovely trips out.'

Mrs Shreider's daughter, Maureen, who has travelled to the UK with her mother, added: 'It’s like she’s come alive again since she got to Plymouth.'
