A beauty therapist who went abroad for a bargain boob job was horrified when the implants burst through her skin just days later, nearly killing her. 

Claire Hawker, 30, had been recommended the cosmetic surgeon in Prague by a friend and was initially delighted with her new figure.

But just days after returning home, her size G breasts started leaking a brown discharge and suddenly burst.

Claire Hawker was nearly killed by a boob job she had abroad after developing a raging infection

After being rushed to hospital, surgeons warned the mother-of-two she would die if the implants were not removed immediately. 

‘I remember feeling scared then angry when I was told my implants would have to be taken out - but I had no choice,' says Ms Hawker, from Reading.

'I had wanted bigger boobs for almost a decade because they had really sagged after having children. My  confidence was rock bottom.'

While one breast was a 34B cup, the was other a C - and both began to droop following the birth of her daughter, Jasmine, at 17.

‘Working in the beauty industry it was important to me to look good and feel confident, though I hadn’t for a very long time,’ said Ms Hawker.

‘I would look in the mirror and feel so self-conscious about that part of my body. I wished my breasts could be bigger.’

But as a single mother, she couldn't afford expensive cosmetic surgery.

'It got to the point where my appearance was affecting how I felt at work, though. As a beauty therapist it was critical I looked and felt good, but my clothes hung on me like a sack of potatoes.’

Then in July 2008 a friend who’d had liposuction at a cosmetic surgery in Prague recommended the clinic to Ms Hawker.

After researching the clinic online, she discovered she could have a breast uplift and implants for £2,300 – a third of the cost she would pay in the UK.

Friends and family also backed her decision to go abroad, so she took out a loan for £4,000 to cover flights and expenses.

She was also unhappy with her uneven breasts (left) and hoped surgery would sort the problem out. But even a week after surgery in Prague, she was in agonising pain (right) 

'A year later as I got on the plane to Prague, I was so excited about having the body I'd always dreamed of,' she said. 

After five days exploring the city, Ms Hawker met the surgeon who would perform her procedure.

She said: 'The receptionist at the clinic explained the surgeon didn’t speak much English, so I should show him photos of what I wanted.

‘But I assured myself he knew what he was doing and I showed him some magazine clippings of celebs with size G breasts, like I wanted.’

However on waking up two hours after the op, she was in total agony.

'My breasts were bandaged up so I couldn’t seem them and there was pain shooting through my chest.

'I told my friend I thought I was going to die.’

The next day, her bandages were changed again before she was discharged - still without having seen her new breasts. 

Surgeons told Ms Hawker her  implants were too big. This had ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected

Even as she boarded the plane home the day after, her breasts continued to ache and she took some tablets the surgery had given her to ease her suffering.

'I figured I should expect some pain following surgery, so I did my best not to worry,' she said.

Back home, she spent the following few days slumped on the sofa, barely able to move her arms for the pain.

But a week later, despite still being bandaged up, she decided she was ready to visit the salon where she worked to show her mother and colleagues her new breasts.

As she lifted her top however, she noticed her bra was damp and a brown, smelly discharge was leaking from her left breast.

‘My mum said she could see my implant poking out of a 50p sized hole in my skin, which had burst open.’

After being rushed to Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, a surgeon examined her breast.

As he did, the skin under her right breast split too.

‘He said my implants were too big and they’d ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected.

'They had to be removed or I would die.'

He added she was the fourth person he'd seen that week who's been the victim of botched cosmetic surgery abroad. 

Later that day Ms Hawker was taken in to theatre to have her implants removed and she spent the next week having the infection washed out of them.

'I spent two weeks in hospital and regretted going overseas so much,' she said. 'It really hadn’t been worth it.’

Even after being discharged, Ms Hawker had to return every two weeks for the next year so that nurses could clean her wounds and check her breasts were healing.

But nothing can repair her confidence, which is now even lower, having been left with small breasts and horrific scarring.

She said: ‘My breasts looked even worse than before and I worried even if I got new implants, the skin under them would always look like I’d been burnt.

‘At least the uplift I’d received overseas hadn’t gone wrong, so my breasts looked alright when I wore strappy tops.

‘But I continued to miss the fullness my new breasts had given me and my confidence, at work and going out with friends, and I felt at an all-time low.’

She was told she would have to wait at least two years - and until she’d made a full recovery - before she could have further surgery.

Though it would cost her thousands - and she was still paying off her loan for her original surgery, Ms Hawker said she couldn't stay the way she was.

Then in May 2013, she spotted a magazine ad recruiting people for a documentary about botched cosmetic surgery called Botched Up Bodies. In return they’d receive free corrective surgery. 

Last year Ms Hawker underwent further surgery in the UK to correct the damage and enlarge her breasts again

 She said: 'Having this surgery changed my life. I’m more confident now and love receiving compliments. I just wish I hadn't risked my life the first time for cheap cosmetic surgery'

Ms Hawker said: ‘I was anxious about appearing on TV but my mum encouraged me and I decided it was worth it to get the body I wanted.’

At Royal Welbeck Hospital, in London, a leading cosmetic surgeon Dr Nick Percival, from Cosmetic Surgery Partners, examined her and recommended an E cup.

On the day of her surgery last June she admits feeling nervous.

'But when I came round hours later - not in any pain and with new 34E breasts - she was thrilled.

Then in November, she had a second procedure to remove the scar tissue she’d lived with for three years.

She said: ‘Having this surgery changed my life. I’m more confident now and love receiving compliments.

‘I wish I hadn’t been so eager before to have cosmetic surgery. I should have researched my options and saved up to have it done in the UK.

‘Instead, going abroad almost cost me my life. It’s not worth risking it for cheap cosmetic surgery.’
