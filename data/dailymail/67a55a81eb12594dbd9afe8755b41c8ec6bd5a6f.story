A nine-year-old girl has penned a book about her younger brother in the hopes of raising a million dollars to help find a cure for his rare disease.

Makenzie Lawrey, from Cape Coral, Florida wrote 'The Mighty Mito Superhero' about six-year-old Gavin who suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, which does not have a cure.

The disease, which leaves cells in the body unable to produce energy, means Gavin suffers seizures that leave him tired and unable to beat infections.

'He turned 18-months-old and a light switch went off and he just changed,' his mother Brandi Lawrey told NBC2. 'We'd never heard of it. We didn't know what to do.'

She told WinkNews that her daughter Makenzie has always written down her thoughts but recently decided she wanted to turn them into a book to help educate others, while raising funds for a cure.

So she contacted Gavin's doctor and carried out her own research before writing the book in a way it would be easy to understand.

It includes photographs of her and her family throughout the years alongside descriptions of how she has helped to take care of her little brother.

Determined: Makenzie, pictured reading to her brother, said she wants to raise a million dollars with the book

Educational: The book follows her brother's heroic journey through medical procedures

Journey: The book is written from Makenzie's point of view as she watches her little brother in pain

'Gavin is my superhero,' she writes in the book. 'Gavin battles pain while teaching those around him lessons.'

Makenzie explained: 'I wanted to write this book so there was
 a better way for people to understand what Mito is. It makes me feel really good because I know that even if he doesn't feel good I can still help in a way.'

Despite Makenzie's best intentions, her mother was initially skeptical about her daughter's aim to raise a million dollars.

'She said, "Hopefully I can raise a million dollars" and I said, "A million dollars?"' Brandi said.

Illness: The disease, which affects cells responsible for making energy, leaves Gavin weak. Here he is pictured with his service dog Hershey after being hospitalized following seizures at school

Caring: Nine-year-old Makenzie is pictured comforting her little brother while in hospital

Hopeful: Their mother Brandi said she has been shocked by the positive response to the book already

Makenzie added: 'And she said, "How about $10,000? And I said, "No, a million".'

But in less than a week, Makenzie has sold more than 500 books and collected about $20,000 - thanks to the big sister's devotion and the firm following of their Facebook fans.

Mrs Lawrey encourages people to donate an amount equal to their age when they are buying the book to represent the life they hope Gavin can live, Wink reported.

Â Mitochondrial disease is caused by the failure of mitochondria, which are present in every cell in the body, apart from red blood cells. They are responsible for creating energy in the body and so their failure means less energy for the cells, eventually causing cell death.

If this continues to happen throughout the body, it can cause systems to fail, such as the heart, lungs or muscles. It can cause weakness, pain, poor growth, seizures, cardiac disease, the inability to fight infections or problems with swallowing, sight or hearing, among other issues.

The body's weakness means that even a simple flu or cold virus can have devastating effects on the patient, and even cause death. Any illness must be treated immediately with medical interventions, like IV fluids and IV antibiotics.

Around one in 4,000 children in the U.S. will develop mitochondrial disease by the age of 10. Treatments are limited and doctors often prescribe vitamins.
