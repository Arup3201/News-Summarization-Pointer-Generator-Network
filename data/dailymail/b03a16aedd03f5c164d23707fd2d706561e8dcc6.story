Dallas Cowboys fans have a reason to lift their spirits despite not making it into this weekend's highly-anticipated playoffs.

And it doesn't have much to do with football.

Some of the worldâ€™s hottest babes have just released a video that proves the Dallas Cowboys are really something to talk about.

Scroll down for video...

One for the team: The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders appeared in a video shot by a GoPro camera strapped to a hula hoop

The team's cheerleaders recently appeared in a video shot in an unorthodox fashion â€“ namely, on a hula hoop.

As the hoop went round and round in circles, so did the GoPro camera attached to it, giving viewers a fine, 360 degree example of what the cheer-leading ladies have to offer.

The video was shot in a tropical beach and swimming pool setting with the girls flaunting their hot bods in their favourite swimsuits.

The video, which was posted on YouTube on January 8, has already had almost 500,000 hits.

Go Cowboys!
