Police officers on Merseyside are on alert for Sunday's crunch clash between Liverpool and Manchester United after a number of well-known United hooligans saw their banning orders expire.

The match between the two fierce rivals, which carries the highest security risk rating, kicks-off at Anfield at 1.30pm.

Along with the usual bragging rights, this season it also features the added tension of both sides being in direct competition for a Champions League spot.

And it is understood around half-a-dozen known United troublemakers are free to go to the game after orders preventing them from going to matches ended last year.

United will take around 3,000 followers to Liverpool. While police are happy with the early kick-off time, they are aware of the various elements which could potentially turn things ugly but remain confident they can deal with any situations.

In November, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) deployed around 400 officers for the Manchester derby, which the previously-banned hooligans were also able to attend.

Raheem Sterling had several opportunities to score for his team, but failed to find the net last December

While the match passed without major incidents of disorder a large-scale brawl was captured on a mobile phone video more than 90 minutes after the final whistle.

There, a number of United fans fought with City supporters outside a pub close to the Etihad Stadium, setting off a flare and hurling bottles.

Police said fans used chairs and wooden poles as weapons amid chaotic scenes.

Five men were later arrested, while a man thought to be a City fan lay motionless on the ground after being punched and kicked in the head. He later declined hospital treatment.

When Liverpool played United at Old Trafford in December the match, which ended 3-0 to the home side, passed with a small number of arrests.
