1 Nico Rosberg, Mercedes 1:40.480

2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes +0.386

3 Valtteri Bottas, Williams +0.545

A warning sign flashed in front of Lewis Hamilton here in the desert night as Nico Rosberg took pole position for the race that will determine the destiny of the world title on Sunday.

It is the German’s 11th pole of the season and the most important, coming ahead of an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that will be fought as much in the head as on the baking track of Yas Marina circuit.

They were jigging in the Mercedes garage – Rosberg’s wife Vivian and the Mercedes’ hierarchy – as he beat Hamilton. 

Rosberg put up his thumb and thrust his forearm out as he came back into the pit lane. It was a gesture of intent.

Rosberg’s lap was faster by 0.386sec, with Hamilton’s final flying lap off the pace from the first sector.

However, Hamilton need only finish second to win his second title on Sunday regardless of whether Rosberg wins the race. That is the cushion of the Briton’s 17-point lead going into the weekend.

The random factors are the Williams cars. Valtteri Bottas was third and Felipe Massa fourth.

‘It is only one small step,’ said Rosberg, ‘because it is about the championship, not pole position. It would have been great if a Williams got between the two of us. Perhaps that can happen tomorrow.’

Hamilton’s voice was deeper. ‘I enjoyed qualifying but as Nico said tomorrow is the special day.’

There had been a few lively moments earlier in the session. Hamilton locked up in the first session and Rosberg, more dramatically, ran wide in the second. Then Hamilton was far on to the kerbs in his first fast lap in the third. 

Before the action started, came the phoney war. The German newspaper Bild reported that Hamilton fans were making noise in the yachts in Yas Marina to disturb Rosberg, whose rest room is nearby.Hamilton’s room is next door so I’m not sure it’s a fool-proof plan of disturbance.

Despite being slower than Hamilton in the opening two sessions, Rosberg (pictured) made it count when it mattered in Abu Dhabi

Jenson Button, in what might be the last Formula One qualifying session of his life, will start eighth, but only after he needed to go back to the pits because McLaren had forgotten to fuel him. ‘Are you joking,’ he said.

He still beat his rival for a seat at the team next year, Kevin Magnussen, who will start 11th. Button stands 10-9 in qualifying performances this season. Will that register on the radar of Ron Dennis, who was watching here from the pit wall?

Among the first to fall by the harbour side were the Caterhams of Kamui Kobayashi and British rookie Will Stevens.

Just making it here was a triumph of sorts for Caterham, whose affairs are being overseen by a pint-sized Irishman called Finbarr O’Connell, the administrator and ballroom dance devotee. He finds himself on the pit wall.

He will not get the call to lead Ferrari, of course. They are expected to dispense with team principal Marco Mattiacci to be replaced by Marlboro vice-president Maurizio Arrivabene.

There is also a suggestion that Ross Brawn will emerge from his ‘retirement’ to rejoin the team with which he enjoyed so much success as an architect of the Michael Schumacher era. He denied it in a text to Martin Brundle of Sky. 

Jenson Button, who could be competing at his final grand prix weekend, will start from eighth position in Abu Dhabi 

Rosberg must surely win on Sunday and he has given himself every hope after securing pole position with a blistering lap on Saturday
