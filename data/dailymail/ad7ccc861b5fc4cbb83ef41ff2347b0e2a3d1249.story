Jayden Watson, five, was born with rare genetic condition harlequin ichthyosis, which means his skin grows seven times faster than normal

A mother has revealed her heartache enduring the cruel taunts of parents encouraging their children away from her son because they believe he is 'contagious'.

The five-year-old actually suffers from an incredibly rare genetic condition which leaves him with  thick, dry, skin resembling 'fish-scales'.

Jayden Watson, of Bedford, Warwickshire was born with harlequin ichthyosis, a condition which causes his skin to grow seven times faster than normal.

While there is no cure for the painful condition, it is not contagious.

But Jayden's mother Jane Blackford said she has had to listen as other parents berate her, telling her to take better care of her son.

The 25-year-old said some people have even ushered their children away from Jayden, whose nickname is Super Jayden.   

'We were in the park when a woman came storming over,' she recalled.

'She said: "Keep your child out of the sun, can't you see you've burnt him?"

'Another day I saw a mother tell her son to stay away from Jayden in case he was contagious.

'It is heartbreaking, but people just aren't aware of the condition.'

Harlequin ichthyosis is an extremely rare genetic  skin condition.

Parents who carry the gene have a one in four chance of having a child with the illness. 

It is caused by a mutation in the gene thought to be involved in the transport of fats into the spaces between the skin cells.

The skin appears tight, with thick plates of hard scales resembling armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester, and splits in different areas, causing deep cracks.

A sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales.

Miss Blackford said doctors realised there was something wrong with Jayden as soon as he was born.

She said she couldn't see her newborn son straight away, after her 15-hour labour, because he was being cared for in an incubator.

She asked her partner Paul Watson, 28, what their son looked like and he said: 'I can't really describe him – it's like he's got scales.'

A nurse then warned: 'His appearance might alarm you.'

Miss Blackford added: 'Doctors told me he was very ill and might have just days to live but nothing could've prepared me for how poorly my baby looked.

Jayden's condition leaves him with thick, dry, fish-scale skin which has to be constantly removed. He is pictured with parents  Jane Blackford, 25 (left) and father Paul Watson, 28, (right)

Harlequin ichthyosis is incurable, and parents have to apply ointment to Jayden's skin three or four times a day (he is pictured left and right as a baby). His mother describes how other parents ignorant about the condition incorrectly believe he is 'contagious' and have ushered their children away from him

Despite his condition, Jayden learned to walk and talk and now attends nursery, where he has lots of friends. He is pictured with his mother during a charity run

'His mouth was stretched open, as if he was silently screaming. The skin all over his body was cracked and bleeding.

'We were told he was suffering from harlequin ichthyosis which is where the skin is thick and extremely dry.

'Jayden's condition was so severe that it was likely he'd pick up a fatal infection.

'As we held him a nurse told us, "Every moment is precious".'

Miss Blackford said she felt 'overcome with love' for her son, but was terrified she would hurt him.

'We didn't leave his side,' she said.

Harlequin Ichthyosis is extremeley rare and severe skin condition.

It is caused by a mutation in the ABCA12 gene which is thought to be involved in the transport of fats into the spaces between the skin cells.

It is a genetic condition. The parents of an affected baby are carriers and will have a one in four risk of any baby being affected.

The condition causes the skin to grow seven times faster than normal.

The skin appears tight, with thick plates of hard scales resembling armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester.

The skin splits at several areas causing deep cracks. And a sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales.

The extra skin needs to be removed constantly and ointment is also applied four or five times-a-day.

Babies with the condition tend to be born prematurely and are usually small. 

Children who survive will need ongoing intensive skin treatment with creams and courses of retinoid medicine and many require physiotherapy and counselling. 

There is no cure for it and it cannot be prevented.

'Doctors told us the skin around Jayden's hands and feet was so thick and tight he wouldn't be able to use them if they didn't operate to remove some of the skin.'

On June 25, 2010, when Jayden was just two days old, he was taken in for surgery.

Afterwards, he was bandaged from head to toe.

His dressings were replaced every hour to stop his skin drying out.

His mother continued: 'During the next week we were shown how to care for him.

'Every hour throughout the day and night his body needed to be slathered in oil and then bandaged.

'A fortnight later we were allowed to take him home.'

Children with the condition need round-the-clock care, as the extra skin needs to be removed constantly and ointment is also applied four or five times a day.

Children who survive will need ongoing intensive skin treatment with creams and courses of retinoid medicine and many require physiotherapy and counselling.

Miss Blackford said caring for Jayden was difficult at first.

She said: 'Applying his lotion during the night left us both exhausted.

'His skin was so sensitive the slightest knock could cause him to bleed.'

But as the months passed Jayden thrived. He learned to walk and talk and now attends nursery.

After his first day  he even told his parents 'I made three new best friends.'

A spokesperson from the Ichthyosis Support Group said harlequin ichthyosis is 'extremely rare and severe'.

They said: 'There are approximately five such children born in the UK each year and some may be stillborn.

'The name comes from the appearance of the skin at birth.

'The skin is covered in tight, thick, plates of hard scale and resembles armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester.

When he was just two days old, doctors carried out surgery to remove the thick skin from Jayden's hands and feet. As Miss Blackford held her son for the first time, a nurse told her 'time was precious'. But as the months went on, Jayden thrived. He is pictured with his mother as a baby

'It splits at several areas causing deep cracks.

'The face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden in the scale.

'The eyes may be invisible because they are temporarily covered by the swollen eyelids.

'The baby's movement and ability to suck is affected and they suffer all the problems of leaky skin.

'They become dehydrated and have poor temperature control, difficulty feeding and sometimes breathing and are also at risk of serious infection.'
