We’re nearly a month into the new Football League season so here are five things from outside the Premier League that have caught my eye so far…

1) Cyrus Christie – the young right back has hit the ground running at Derby County after making the step up from League One Coventry City, his hometown club. 

He had been with the Sky Blues for 13 years so some early season 'homesickness' might have been understandable but he looks like he has been playing in the Championship all his life.

It’s thought Derby picked up him for a fee of around £100,000 after he ran his contract down – it’s a real bargain and I find it hard to believe no Premier League club took him. Makes you wonder how hard their scouts work. 

On his debut on the opening day of the season he provided the cross for the Rams’ winner against Rotherham, and four of the five Derby goals against Fulham on Saturday were started on the right.

His attacking qualities are matched by his defensive ability. This kid is only 21 and on the evidence so far, he has got a massive future. At his current rate of progress he will be in the Premier League next season, either with Derby or somewhere else.

2) Graham Alexander – or as I always call him on talkSPORT, 'the excellent Graham Alexander.' One of the good guys of football was an exemplary professional as a player, and is now proving to be a quality manager at League One table-toppers Fleetwood.

Fleetwood as a club have had a meteoric rise but in those promotion years they have been among the biggest spenders in each division. Chairman Andy Pilley estimates he has injected some £15million of his own money into the club during the years of success. 

But in League One, Fleetwood are no longer the biggest players. The likes of Bristol City, Sheffield United and Leyton Orient are all paying big wages, so it’s harder for Fleetwood to compete. So far Alexander is making it look easy.

3) With Ross Barkley out of the England picture, Roy Hodgson might be wondering who is going to create some magic for England. Who has got that unpredictable spark that the best England teams down the years have had? 

I doubt Hodgson will go looking in the Championship but if he did he would find such a player at Middlesbrough. Had Lee Tomlin been more disciplined – on and off the field - in his career, he would unquestionably have made it to the Premier League by now.

He’s a clever player who can destroy teams on his day. He creates and he scores – he’s a perfect example of how a 'fantasy No 10' should play. He looks heavy but he is deceptively speedy, and runs as quick with the ball as without it, which not many can do. 

There is a Premier League tendency to dismiss the Championship as rubbish, but if you look carefully there are some gems. Tomlin is one of them, albeit a late developer. 

And let’s not forget, the Championship is where Barkley received a great education during a couple of loan spells, and it is a division that the likes of Adam Lallana, Gary Cahill and Leighton Baines have all passed through on their way to the top. There are some gems down there.

4) Bakary Sako was not expected to stay at Wolves when they dropped into the third tier of English football last year. But he did and they were comfortable champions in the end. 

Sako, a left-sided attacking midfielder with a real goal threat, was signed from St Etienne in 2012, and Wolves were then relegated in his first season. But Sako was brilliant in League One and is one of the main reasons Wolves have made such a great start to life in the Championship this season. 

Real threat: Bakary Sako has pace, power, scores goals and has been Wolves' star so far this season

Three years ago the Mali winger was second only to Balise Matuidi as St Etienne’s player of the season. Matuidi is now a regular fixture for Paris Saint-Germain and France, while Sako is working a tougher route to the top. With less than a year left on his Molineux contract it may come sooner rather than later.

5) On a rare Saturday off during an international weekend last season, I went to watch Stevenage vs Rotherham. A blond midfielder ran the game, scored a cracker and looked the part in a 3-0 win for the Millers. 

Ben Pringle has found the right club and the right manager in Steve Evans to harness his unquestionable talents, and that’s why he has already been linked with a Premier League club this season. 

Evans will do everything to stop his best player going to Hull City, though. Pringle is busy, always available for the ball, never hides, and works back too. His delivery from wide areas is usually high quality – he’s a special talent, and he seems to be a good lad to have around the dressing room as well.
