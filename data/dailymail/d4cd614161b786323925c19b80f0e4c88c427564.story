Students could face a further £1,000-a-year rise in tuition fees to help fill a £10billion black hole in the main pension scheme for university staff, experts warn.

They say the institutions will have to raise their charges and increase the contributions from lecturers to plug a ‘very worrying’ deficit much higher than previously thought.

The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is the biggest pension fund in the country with 303,000 members – most of them on gold-plated final salary pensions.

Squeezed: Students could be hit with a £1,000 increase in tuition fees to plug the deficit in staff pensions

USS put its shortfall at £7.9billion in a report last month. But pensions consultant John Ralfe, a former finance director of Boots, says the real deficit is £2.6billion higher.

He examined the data for an investigation by BBC2’s Newsnight. Using the same analysis methods that private companies use, he put the deficit at £10.5billion.

To make good that deficit over 20 years would require a near doubling of contributions  to £1.8billion, he said. That could be achieved by a rise in tuition fees of up to £1,000 a year.

‘There is a whole degree of denial,’ Mr Ralfe said. ‘USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial.

'We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years.

‘There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we’re doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children.’

Higher education minister David Willetts said it would be wrong to pass on the cost to students

The USS has assets of £37.9billion – more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education.

However, it has admitted it has a huge deficit.

Professor Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, said the size of the scheme’s black hole was concerning.

‘It’s very worrying now and it  looks even more worrying for the future,’ he said. ‘It would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some  other source, either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises.’

But higher education minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students.

‘Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits,’ he said.

‘It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits  to support pension schemes that  are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they’re older.’

As well as the threat of higher tuition fees – which can already cost as much as £9,000 a year – university staff could face the prospect of having to pay more for their pensions.

They are already planning to strike next week over pay.

Bill Galvin, chief executive of USS, said that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered. ‘It’s been done in 2008. It’s been done in 2011. We’re looking at it again now,’ he added.

Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, denied yesterday that tuition fees will have to rise to plug the black hole.

‘Employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long-term solutions to ensure that USS remains sustainable and affordable,’ she said.

‘The range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to USS and impact on all pension schemes. There is no question that tuition fees will be increased to plug the USS funding shortfall.’

A USS spokeswoman said: 'USS has been entirely transparent about the deficit figures and provides comprehensive estimates to institutions on an annual basis.

'USS has made changes to both benefits and contribution levels in recent years to deal with historic deficits and will continue  to work with employers and members’ representatives to agree a recovery plan which is commensurate with the long-term nature of the scheme. The employers have made it clear there is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to provide additional funding for the scheme.'
