A man suspected of taking a drugs overdose was arrested after he violently attacked two paramedics - before speeding off in their AMBULANCE.

The ambulance crew treating the 37-year-old patient were forced to call police yesterday after he became so violent they were unable to control him.

The man assaulted the two male paramedics just before 3pm on the High Street in Bloxwich, West Midlands, after being helped from a flat to the ambulance.

damaged trying to stop the fleeing man and the police officer driving 
needed to be taken to hospital

But before the police could arrive the man forced the paramedics out of their ambulance, jumped behind the wheel and sped off with the vehicle's back doors still open.

He then drove erratically down the busy road for nearly two miles, making at least two U-turns, before crashing into a police car outside the village's Baptist Church. After being forced to stop by the collision the man was then arrested.

West Midlands Police confirmed the man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault and vehicle theft. He was then held at a nearby police station.

Inspector Tony Banton, from Bloxwich Police Station, said: 'The ambulance was driven off with its rear doors still open.

'It was reported being driven very erratically and we're looking into whether it may have struck other vehicles.

'A response vehicle quickly picked up the ambulance and the man was arrested within five minutes of the emergency call coming in to us.

'There was a low-level collision between the ambulance and the arresting officer's car. That officer has been taken to hospital suffering whiplash-like injuries.

'Two male members of ambulance staff were also taken to hospital as a precaution but are not seriously injured.'

A spokesperson for the West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'Two ambulance crew members were attacked by a man they'd been called to help, and who they believed needed hospital treatment. For them to be attacked is disgraceful.

'Thankfully they've not been seriously hurt but no doubt this was a shocking, unexpected incident, and one of our vehicles has been badly damaged and will have to be taken off the road for some time to be repaired.

'We won't tolerate any abuse against our staff. Anyone attacking ambulance crew can expect the full weight of the law to come down on them. We will do all we can to help the police with their inquiry.'
