Another day in the life of Floyd Mayweather and that means another opportunity to show everyone just how wealthy he really is.

After uploading a photo of stacks of $100 bills covering his table on his Instagram account on Friday, the undefeated boxing champion went one better on Saturday by revealing his latest purchase - a gold Bentley golf cart.

But what was more surprising was the recipient of the Bentley - his 15-year-old son Koraun!

The pair posed for a photo in the golf cart with Mayweather posting the picture on Instagram attached with the message: 'My son @kingkoraun wanted a Bentley golf cart for his 15th birthday so I made it appear. Stay on the look out for his gift for his 16th birthday!'

While most teenagers dream of hitting the road in expensive sports cars, Mayweather is more than prepared to make this a realty as early as possible for Koraun - just as soon as he reaches the legal age to drive in America.

When your dad's nickname is 'Money' though - and is the highest paid athlete in the world - it's probably just to be expected.
