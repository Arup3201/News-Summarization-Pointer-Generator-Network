The woman who died after her ambulance was delayed due to the road closures enacted by New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s political allies was a mother-of-two who moved to America from Italy for a better life, it emerged today.

Florence Genova had a heart attack at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey, on September 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock.

Her family today said they don't believe that her death was due to the delayed emergency response caused by the George Washington Bridge lane closures ordered by Chris Christie's aides.

Mrs Genova's daughter Vilma Oleri, 57, told the New York Times: 'I honestly believe it was just her time. 'We want to stay out of it. It’s not political.'

Bottleneck: The ambulance took nine minutes to reach Mrs Genova as traffic backed up to cross the double-deck George Washington Bridge which spans the Hudson river between New York City and Fort Lee, New Jersey

But angry friends neighbors have have expressed their outrage that her care may have been compromised 
in any way for what appears to have been an act of revenge on one of 
Christie’s political opponents.

The
 91-year-old was taken to the nearby Englewood Hospital where she died 
later that day. It is not clear if the delay in the ambulance arriving 
contributed to the death of Mrs Genova, a widow whose husband died five 
years ago.

Neighbours 
of Mrs Genova told MailOnline they were appalled that her ambulance was 
delayed by the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge.

They said they were shocked and disappointed if it emerged that Christie had anything to do with it.Gus Jentile, who lived next door to her for 56 years, said: 'I can't believe that a guy of that stature would stoop so low.

'I looked up to that guy as a politician.'

Mr Jentile, whose kids grew up with Mrs Genova, said: 'Politics is a dirty game but it shouldn't cost lives'.

Neighbor of 18-years, Vlador Stosic, 68, said that Mrs Genova was simply an old lady who kept herself very quiet.

He
 revealed she had lived alone for five years by the time of her death - 
her husband dying outside their own home in Fort Lee, New Jersey after 
falling and hitting his head on the ice.

'She would sit on the porch in the summer,' he said.

'Her children would visit every so often and she would never have other visitors'

Mrs Genova is understood to have 
grown up in Mongardino, a small town in Italy 30 miles outside of Turin 
and moved to the US in the 1960s.

She and her husband settled in Fort Lee which has a strong Italian American community. Neighbours said they built their own home as they made their new life in America. Her children have now moved away.

Vlado
 Stosic, who lives next door, told the New Jersey Star Telegram said 
that Mrs Genova was found by a home health aide and that she had fallen 
in her bedroom.

Mrs Genova was unconscious so the aide called for an ambulance.

Another neighbour, Dina Mirkovich, said Mrs Genova was ‘a very quiet lady’.

She said: ‘My mother was friends with her. They spoke Italian to each other.’

‘She built that house probably. The original old time people from this neighborhood, they all stay. The children move away.’

They should lose their jobs: Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, who refused to support Christie has called the closure a 'heinous act'

Mrs
 Genova was among four medical incidents which Fort Lee borough EMS head
 Paul Favia said were affected by the road closures, which were put in 
place over four days to spite the local mayor

Mark Sokolich for not backing Christie in his last election.

The
 others included a traffic accident with four people involved which 
should have taken four minutes to get to, but instead took between seven
 and nine minutes.

In a
 letter to Mayor Sokolich, Mr Favia said that in relation to Mrs Genova 
‘paramedics were delayed due to heavy traffic on Fort Lee Road and had 
to meet the ambulance en-route to the hospital instead of on the scene’.

Fort Lee police also revealed that the search for a missing four-year-old boy was hampered by the gridlock.

Ila
 Kasofsky, a Fort Lee councilwoman, told Mother Jones that one resident 
was unable to cross the George Washington Bridge to be with her husband 
during a major surgery.

One woman was unable to pick up her son after his dialysis as well.

The
 governor's chances of a presidential run are now threatened following 
the release of emails proving members of his staff blocked lanes on the 
bridge back in September because the mayor of Fort Lee refused to 
endorse Christie's re-election campaign.

'Is
 it wrong that I am smiling,' former Port Authority official David 
Wildstein said in a text message after successfully reverting three 
lanes of traffic to one.

Mayor Sokolich broke his silence in an interview Wednesday on CNN in which he called the lane closures  a 'heinous act' and that the officials who did it 'intentionally put people in harms way'.

When the lane closures first 
happened, Mayor Sokolich was told that it was because he wouldn't 
endorse Christie but he refused to believe that.

'Right
 from the beginning, people were saying it was about me and a failure to
 endorse. I always dismissed it as not being important enough. I mean, 
who would possibly reduce themselves to closing lanes to the busiest 
bridge in the world, putting my town in harm's way?'

Now
 that the emails and text messages prove it was aimed at him, he says 
he's glad he didn't endorse the incumbent Republican governor.

'No one should have to do anything like that or provide any sort of support under threat of retribution,' he said.

Meanwhile, Governor Christie has been working to distance himself from Bridge-gate, pinning the blame on members of his staff.

He has fired his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and barred former campaign manager  Bill Stepien from working with the local Republican party.

'What
 I've seen today for the first time is unacceptable,' Christie said. 'I 
am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a
 member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned 
conduct was made without my knowledge.'

Shocking
 emails revealed Christie's aides punished Mayor Mark Sokolich for 
refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter traffic entering his
 town's on-ramp to New York City's busy George Washington Bridge.

Emails and instant messages between 
Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and two appointees at 
the Port Authority revealed a calculated effort to retaliate against 
Sokolich by closing off lanes leading to the bridge.

'Time
 for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the 
event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive 
political payback.

'Got it,' responded David Wildstein, a Christie ally who served as a Port Authority official until his resignation – unrelated to the bridge mini-scandal, the Christie administration has insisted – in early December.

The Christie administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by Wildstein. 

Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to a Port Authority official on August 13, subpoenaed documents show

But the trove of emails and other 
messages, obtained by several news outlets on Wednesday, show that the 
governor's appointees reveled in their accomplishment and later 
expressed shock when Port Authority officials in New York restored the 
Fort Lee traffic.

'The New York side gave Fort Lee back all three lanes this morning. We are appropriately going nuts', Wildstein wrote to Kelly.

'What??' she responded in an email.

'Yes, unreal. Fixed now,' Wildstein responded.

After
 Mayor Sokolich complained to the Port Authority that the traffic jam 
was keeping children from reaching schools on their bus routes, 
Wildstein asked in an instant message, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling,'

Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono

'No,' came the reply from the recipient.

'I feel badly about the kids ... I guess,' wrote Wildstein.

'They are children of Buono voters,' his unidentified texting partner answered.

Barbara Buono was the Democrats' failed gubernatorial candidate who garnered Sokolich's endorsement.

She told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the flap represented 'a clear abuse of power. This is what is being inflicted on the people of New Jersey.'

Christie
 won the support of several prominent Democratic politicians in his 
state, in an effort to demonstrate his ability to build bipartisan 
support and reach across the political aisle.

That quality, a Republican strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday, 'will be critical if Christie has any chance at winning the presidency as a Republican in 2016.'
