Louis van Gaal has thrown down the gauntlet to midfielder Anderson who has not played since Manchester United’s goalless draw at Burnley in August.

The club are prepared to write off the £18million midfielder in January but will not pay up his contract to see him go, meaning other clubs will have to match his £60,000-a-week wages, something Brazilian clubs are loathe to do.

Van Gaal has said Anderson has not been fit enough for him to be considered for selection but revealed he has returned to training with the first team and has to show better stamina and energy levels on a consistent basis.

Manchester United midfielder Anderson has struggled for form and fitness under Louis van Gaal

Anderson's last appearance for Manchester United came against Burnley at the end of August

The midfielder has been criticised in other quarters for his lifestyle off the pitch and has been the subject of jokes of other United players about his eating habits.

Van Gaal said: ‘He’s now coming back. He was injured but he’s training now with the team. I cannot say what had happened last year but in my four months here, he’s had a lot of injuries.

‘So I cannot judge him but when he trains he trains at a good level. He’s not always fit and that is more his problem now.

‘I can’t pick him now because you have to be fit. For the first three months the culture of a trainer is fitness. That is the smallest thing you can demand. Professional league fitness. Fitness is the most important thing. First you have to show your fitness. Not for just one day but for several weeks.’

Van Gaal has revealed Anderson has returned to first team training following a number of injuries
