Retired vicar Barry Kinsmen, who has gone missing. Police have found his car near Hawkers Cove, near Padstow, Cornwall

Fears are growing for a retired vicar after his car was found abandoned near a remote clifftop.

Police are hunting for community 'stalwart' and former headteacher Barry Kinsmen, 72, after he failed to turn up at lunch on New Year's Eve.

He has not been spotted since, prompting anxious friends to fear he may have fallen from a clifftop or walked out to sea.

Mr Kinsmen's blue Ford Ka was found abandoned close to his home in Padstow, Cornwall, with a note left inside.

Coastguards
and police searches have so far found no trace of the missing 
pensioner, who is believed to live alone and have no children.

Known
by locals as the 'Cornish Bard', Mr Kinsmen has lived in the area his 
whole life and published a book about his memories growing up there.

Friends
said he enjoys the annual Mayday celebrations and is an enthusiastic 
member of the The Federation of Old Cornwall Societies.

However,
the group's president, Jean Haigh, said Mr Kinsmen's health has 
deteriorated and he is due to have hospital treatment for a hernia.

Mrs Haigh, 87, said: 'I suppose he 
might have been very lonely, he doesn't have any children or a wife. He 
was a dear but he hasn't been well for a while now and has diabetes as 
well as arthritis.

'The 
whole town has been aware that he has not been himself recently and he 
lives alone, this time of year is a very depressing time to be on your 
own.

'Everyone is totally 
devastated. He is a great character but the thing is he is very unwell 
and I understand he was due to go into hospital before he disappeared as
he had a hernia.

'We are praying that we can find him safe and sound, we're just devastated and want him to come home.'

Coastguards and police have conducted 
sea and land searches for Mr Kinsmen and are appealing for sightings of 
the retired clergyman, who used to work at St Petroc's Church in 
Padstow.

The vicar of Padstow Chris Malkinson said worshippers were shocked by his disappearance.

He said: 'He is a single man and a very nice fellow, we don't know why he would disappear, we are just leaving everything with the police for now.'

Padstow mayor Teri Walter added: 'He is such a lovely man who is a great supporter of Padstow and someone who everyone knows and likes.

'What seems to have happened is so sad.'

Mr Kinsmen, who may be wearing a tweed jacket, is described as white, around 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build with balding grey hair.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for his safety.

'What he has done is very out of character. He is a stalwart of the local community and is known by many.'
