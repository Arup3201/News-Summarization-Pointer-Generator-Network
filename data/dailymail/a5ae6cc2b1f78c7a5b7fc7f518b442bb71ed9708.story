Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt decided to take his mind away from Manchester United's 2-1 defeat against Swansea City by taking to Copacabana Beach.

Manchester United supporter Bolt played what he described as 'footvolley' with Brazilian locals.

Bolt is scheduled to race at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday in the Mano a Mano 100m event.

Bolt had earlier tweeted his disappointment at Manchester United's defeat in Louis van Gaal's first competitive game at Old Trafford. 

The 27-year-old took to Twitter to urge Manchester United to grab an equaliser before stating the season is young.

Bolt, who won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow earlier this month, will travel to Warsaw to compete at the Lotto Kamila Skolimowska’s Memorial 100m event after his trip of Brazil.
