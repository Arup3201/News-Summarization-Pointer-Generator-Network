After 19 matches, including winning Olympic gold at London 2012, last year’s title at the Queen’s Club and, of course, Wimbledon, Andy Murray’s glorious streak on grass finally came to an end.

We knew it would eventually, but few could have predicted it would be with a whimper.

The British No 1 was beaten in straight sets 7-6 6-2 by Radek Stepanek, the 35-year-old ranked No 42 in the world, and beaten well.

For once, it was not the deadly mixture of searing summer sun and copious amounts of Pimm’s that kept the well-heeled West London crowd quiet, but the sight of  Murray contriving to beat himself.

It was all too much for one ballgirl, who was overcome by fatigue during the lengthy first set tiebreak which Stepanek won 12-10.

Murray seemed a little bewildered by events himself, squandering eight set points in that tiebreak and losing his first service game in the second set.

Stepanek, a seasoned Davis Cup campaigner, refused to give in to the younger man as his friend,  Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, looked on. Stepanek sealed the tiebreak and then cantered through the second set, breaking Murray twice, to earn a quarter-final tie against Kevin Anderson.

The Wimbledon champion, one of the best returners in the game, struggled to pick the Czech’s first serve, on which Stepanek lost only four points, and was pushed back on the court as the veteran seized advantage at the net. There was certainly plenty for Murray’s  new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, to ponder as she scribbled notes.

Murray said: ‘​I have only got myself to blame that I lost the first set. Quite a lot of them were on my serve and, on this surface especially, you shouldn’t really be losing sets like that. For me, that’s what’s  disappointing really. I blew the first set and that was my fault. I have played well on the grass over the last few years and my best results came when I had a decent amount of preparation time.

‘It’s more about how I get myself ready for Wimbledon now and hopefully I can do a good job of that.’

Murray’s unbeaten run on grass is over, but there is no cause for despair with Wimbledon just over a week away. The 27-year-old did not play on the clay at Roland Garros last year after pulling out of the French Open with a back injury and practised for 10 days on grass before winning Queen’s and Wimbledon, becoming only the seventh man to achieve the feat.

This time, he has come into the tournament straight from a French Open semi-final, with only two days to adjust.

He looked a little rusty and upright when confronted with the lower bounce on grass and said his hamstrings felt slightly stiff, but Murray is not alone in struggling with the transition.

Rafael Nadal was beaten on grass  in Halle, Germany, where Roger Federer needed three sets to edge past Joao Sousa. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, was last spotted  relaxing at a beach club in Ibiza.

Murray went to the gym ‘to do some weights’ immediately after yesterday’s defeat and will not pick up a racket again until he plays mixed doubles in the ‘Rally for Bally’, in memory of Elena Baltacha, at Queen’s on Sunday.

Eye opener: Despite the defeat, Murray still has high hopes to defend his Wimbledon title

He plans to relax, catch up with friends and watch the World Cup in the interim, although he laughed and admitted he will leave the gardening to his girlfriend, Kim Sears.

It transpires Murray prefers to play on grass, rather than mow it.

‘I have never mowed a lawn in my life,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t want to mess it up and it wouldn’t look great if I tried.’

After that will come an exhibition match at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham and then three or four days practising in the relative ‘peace and quiet’ of the All England Club before everything ‘gets quite hectic’ in the last few days before Wimbledon begins.

That, you would imagine, could be something of an understatement from the first British man for 77 years to defend the title.
