A ballroom and Latin dancer who will never compete again after a hit-and-run has blasted police who dropped her case to due a lack of evidence.

Helen Ansell, 20, had to have four operations - including a metal plate in her left leg - after breaking her leg and ankle in the crash in Nottingham, where she studies at university.

She spent three weeks in intensive care with broken metatarsals in her foot and a six-inch gash in her calf while police traced the car suspected of hitting her and arrested two men.

Anger: Helen Ansell, a talented Latin and ballroom dancer, has been told she will never dance again after a hit-and-run driver left her for dead - and has now blasted police who closed her case due to lack of evidence

Injuries: Miss Ansell had to have four operations and a metal plate put in her left leg (pictured) after the crash

But they have now released the men and closed the case, saying there is not enough evidence to bring a successful prosecution. 

The English literature student at Nottingham University was crossing the road in Lenton, Nottingham, at 4.30pm on March 7 when she was hit by a BMW and left for dead. 

'The driver didn’t even try to stop and was gone before anyone knew it', she said.

'I was halfway across and then saw a car speeding down the road really fast, so I began to run to get out the way.

'I didn’t make it in time though, and before I knew it I was knocked flying in the air and thrown under a car.

Recovery: Miss Ansell is still having to study part-time, and will not return to her degree full-time until January

'I was in absolute agony. I can’t explain the pain that I felt, and the fact I didn’t pass out until 2am meant I felt every bit of it.

'I thought the police would find them, but now I just have to hope someone else saw it happen.

'I hate the fact the people responsible are walking around without a care and I am facing another two years of rehabilitation before I will get to the best I will ever be - whatever that is. It is really unjust.'

The crash meant Miss Ansell has had to stay for another year of university because she had to take six months off her studies to recover.

She is still studying part-time and doctors say she will not be in lectures again full-time until January.

The former talented Latin and ballroom dancer was also told she will never dance again. 

Left for dead: Miss Ansell was crossing this road in Nottingham in the middle of the afternoon in March

She said: 'There have been plenty of tough days, but I can walk again. I am lucky as I have heard of these things ending up much worse.'

A spokeswoman from Nottinghamshire Police said: 'Despite a full and thorough investigation there is insufficient evidence to progress the case any further.

'Two men were arrested in connection with the offence but were released with no further action. If any further evidence comes to light we can review this.'

Sally Green, 45, a close friend of Miss Ansell’s mother who died of cancer in 2009, said she was 'absolutely shocked' by the decision.

She said: 'She has been amazing how she has got through it. She just wants someone to be brought to justice for what she has been through.'
