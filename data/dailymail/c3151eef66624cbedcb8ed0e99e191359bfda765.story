The Australian Tax Office is threatening to take audit action against local companies and major multinational corporations following the leak of almost 28,000 pages of documents exposing their complex Luxembourg tax structures.

An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) found that accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers helped 343 local and overseas companies shrink their tax bills - in some cases to almost zero – by routing their profits through the tiny European nation.

This includes IKEA which has made an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in profits in Australia since 2003, but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $103 million and paid $31 million in tax, the Australian Financial Review reported.

ICIJ director Gerard Ryle said the companies featured in the documents – including Australian companies Lend Lease, Macquarie Group, Goodman Group, The Future Fund and AMP – all used different tax structures.

'The emphasis is that all of this is perfectly legal, no one is breaking any laws here,' Mr Ryle told Daily Mail Australia.

'Luxembourg isn't seen as a tax haven, it's seen as a first-world country.

'They're above board and above reproach.'

Mr Ryle said the fact that companies were paying small amounts of tax in Australia affected all Australians.

'If companies or individuals aren't paying their fair share of taxes it means we end up paying more,' he said.

Investigation leader Gerard Ryle said 'Luxembourg isn't seen as a tax haven, it's seen as a first-world country' 

'Essentially it's a simple issue, it's all about fairness.'

Mr Ryle said the global corporations use Luxembourg to reduce billions of dollars in taxes, often by setting up subsidiaries or separate entities in the country.

Between 2002 and 2013:

'The idea of doing this all legally is to make sure your profits are being earned in a place where you're being taxed the least,' he said.

'So if you are taxed 10 percent in Australia, you want to earn the money somewhere else where the rate is one percent or less.

'So you might set up an entity in Luxembourg that lends your Australian company money at a high percentage, and then what happens there is you're shifting the profit because the Australian company has to pay interest rates to Luxembourg.'

Mr Ryle said Luxembourg received a small percentage of the money but for the country 'it is about volume'.

'If there are billions of dollars going through, even if it's a tiny bit, it's worth their while,' he said,

Mr Ryle added that the documents were studied by tax experts and journalists for almost six months, after smaller investigations in France and the UK.

ATO commissioner Chris Jordan has seen the documents and said the tax office had started analysing the data.

'I want to reaffirm we will be checking the data that has been published and if we see discrepancies from what we've been told we will take audit action,' Mr Jordan said in a statement.

'We have stepped up our commitment and effort to ensure multinationals pay tax in Australia on the income they earn here.

'We are very aware that taking action with those who do not do the right thing is critical to community confidence in our fairness and integrity, and ultimately the sustainability of the system.'

A Pricewaterhouse Coopers spokeswoman said the firm provides independent professional advice to clients on a wide range of tax issues.

'This can include advice on the taxation of potential business transactions in a particular country. We also assist our clients with the preparation of tax returns and with discussions with tax authorities,' she said in a statement.

'All our advice and assistance is given in accordance with applicable local, European and international tax laws and agreements and is guided by the PwC Global Tax Code of Conduct which has been in place since 2005.

'Our client relationships are governed by strict confidentiality; we cannot comment on individual cases.'

An IKEA Australia spokewoman said: 'IKEA Group retailer in Australia pays all taxes incurred nationally and locally in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country.'
