HOW WE ARE by Vincent Deary (Allen Lane £16.99) 

WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE by Oprah Winfrey (Pan Macmillan £14.99)

The two books on my desk couldn’t be more different yet they share a similar aim: to nudge readers towards leading a better, happier life.

One is big, one is small. One is a first book by a hitherto unknown health psychologist and therapist, the other is by an international media superstar. One is baggy and would have benefited from some pruning and shaping. The other is so distilled I’d have liked more.

Vincent Deary’s ideas are dense, sometimes irritatingly pretentious, fascinating, jumbled and often profound.

For 14 years, Oprah Winfrey has written a column called What I Know For Sure in her own magazine Oprah, and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected

Oprah Winfrey would probably be happy with the description ‘homespun wisdom’ yet her simply expressed thoughts resonate with the clarity of a small bell.

Both are, in essence personal journeys which invite readers to walk a little way in the author’s shoes, then critically examine their own worn-out old footwear.

How We Are is the first volume of a promised trilogy with the grandly ambitious title, How To Live. It will be followed by How We Break and then How We Mend. This is, in essence, self-help for literary intellectuals, who love Alain de Botton (as I do) but would probably regard reading Oprah Winfrey as beneath them.

Oprah's self-help book is more heartfelt and straightforward

And by the way, I write in the conviction that in encouraging people to re-construct their lives, ‘self-help’ or personal development and inspirational books can do much good.

Bring them on, I say. There’s a lot of need out there. Deary’s aim is to make us understand how much of our lives settle into ‘grooves’ of habit, often without us being aware of the fact. From the routes we take to the way we dress (some wonderfully well-observed insights here), our daily lives are circumscribed by set ways of thinking, feeling and acting which can render us ‘stuck’ in an unfulfilling present.

Change is terrifying — and yet the discomfort (sometimes agony) of shifting our habits is an essential part of the process. No pain, no gain, as they say.

As an advice columnist, I recognise the truth (in terms of my readers’ problems) of this: ‘ . . .if the new is to become our new normal, if we are to get through to the end, we must be, for a while, overwhelmed.

‘These are the moments of truth, where we either give up or push on.’ The end of a relationship, or job, or working life . . . these are just some of the stages in life which require us to change. Bereavement is another.

Deary introduces us to some of his family and friends to illustrate points — and lets us into some of the dilemmas of his own life to enable us to see how many small decisions, made each day, add up to cumulative change.

For much of the book he appears to be saying, ‘Look at me, I’m neurotic and make mistakes like the best of you and I’m really, really terrified of writing this book, too.’

He writes: ‘May I not falter. I am dedicating myself to this project on transformation in the hope it might be a transformative project.’

In other words, he wants to help himself.

Such self-consciousness can grate, but it’s also endearing. Similarly, his range of references might intimidate — or exhilarate.

So his writing can be as indigestible as an over-rich meal, yet when he writes simply (from the breath of his professional and personal experience), choosing to communicate directly, he can be uplifting: ‘ . . .improvement happens, people get better. I mean better at living, at being who they are, at handling life with grace, humour and courage.’

Those three qualities abound in Oprah Winfrey’s collection. For 14 years, she has written a column called What I Know For Sure in her own magazine Oprah, and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected.

Oprah is more open than Vincent Deary about the traumas of her life; on the other hand, this is to be expected since her traumatic childhood is already in the public domain.

Vincent Deary’s ideas are dense, sometimes irritatingly pretentious, fascinating, jumbled and often profound

Yet there’s still something sublime in the way she cuts to the chase:

‘I know for sure that healing the wounds of the past is one of the biggest and most worthwhile challenges of life. It’s important to know when and how you were programmed so you can change the program. And doing so is your responsibility, no one else’s. That is the irrefutable law of the universe: We are each responsible for our own life.’

Yes, indeed. That thought doesn’t need to be hedged about with theory or quotation.

It’s clear that Oprah was determined to heal herself with the practice of mindfulness before it became a fashionable buzz-word. She says her ‘number one spiritual practice is trying to live in the present moment’ and yet there is nothing ’new-age’ about this African-American woman whom both peers and younger women rightly regard as such an inspiration.

On the contrary, she revels in material possessions (like her very own plane) and friends and dogs and spending Sundays in pyjamas. She says she lives in a condition of ‘exhilarated contentment’ yet you know it has been hard-won. She’s struggled with her weight and with her memories of childhood abuse.

The small book carries many messages, although professional therapists will judge sentences like this as embarrassingly over-simple: ‘The Creator has given you full responsibility for your life and with that responsibility comes an amazing privilege — the power to give yourself the love, affection and intimacy you may not have received as a child.’

Yet there Oprah is writing from the depths of her own life, and her message is one many people want — and need — to hear.

Vincent Deary challenges the mind and Oprah Winfrey massages the soul — and all to the good, because both books could change lives.
