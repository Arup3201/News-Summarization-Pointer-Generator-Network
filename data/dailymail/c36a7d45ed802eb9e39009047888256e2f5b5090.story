Demands: Andrea Leadsom MP is leading a Tory backbench attack on Brussels

Britain should have the power to give a ‘red card’ to EU proposals and existing laws and limit the right to freedom of movement across the Continent, according to the leader of a group of 100 Eurosceptic Tories.

Andrea Leadsom, co-founder of the Fresh Start group of  Conservative MPs, said that without such changes there would be overwhelming calls for Britain to exit the EU.

Her intervention comes ahead of a major speech tomorrow by George Osborne on Britain’s future in a reformed Europe.

David Cameron is struggling to maintain Tory unity on the issue, with more than 90 backbenchers this week backing a call for  Parliament to gain a unilateral veto over new EU laws.

Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday dismissed that idea, saying it would undermine the single market and make even a Swiss or Norwegian-style trading relationship with the EU impossible.

But he suggested the Government is ready to back the idea of allowing a bloc of ten or fewer EU states to veto unwelcome laws in the renegotiation talks promised by Mr Cameron to claw back  powers before an ‘in/out’ referendum on membership.

Mrs Leadsom, writing for MailOnline, argued Britain should demand the creation of a ‘permanent means by which a group of member states’ can reject EU proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary’. Other reforms suggested by the Fresh Start group include the rejection of the EU’s founding principle of ‘ever closer union’, which she says is ‘no longer relevant or necessary’.

Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday dismissed the idea of a unilateral veto, warning it would undermine the EU single market

Free movement legislation, which 
enshrines the right of all EU citizens to move to other countries and 
work and settle there, should be amended to eliminate ‘unintended 
consequences’, she adds.

Ministers
 are backing the idea that the right of citizens of new member states to
 migrate elsewhere should be blocked until average incomes reach a 
certain point.

The group of 
MPs also wants to scrap EU quangos, introduce ‘severe penalties’ for 
fraud and error in EU budgets and see Brussels agree to a ‘full review 
of how taxpayers’ money is used by the EU’.

‘The
 way the EU works now fails to meet the aspirations of the British 
people on crucial levels. If the EU is not fundamentally reformed, the 
clamour for UK withdrawal may become overwhelming,’ Mrs Leadsom said.

‘The
 EU is at a fork in the road. If there is not meaningful reform of the 
EU over the next few years it will continue to lose out against 
emerging, more competitive countries. As an organisation, it is 
over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of 
many citizens in EU countries.’

Mr
 Hague yesterday said the idea of every nation being able to go it alone
 and reject any Brussels edict would be unworkable ‘in any system which 
relies on common rules’.

Mr Hague clashed with Kenneth Clarke - who dismissed suggestions the EU is to blame for unsustainable levels of immigration

But
 he suggested Tory plans to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership before 
an in-out referendum would include a ‘red card’ system that would allow 
fewer than ten nations to reject EU laws outright. ‘We do want a much 
bigger role for national parliaments,’ the Foreign Secretary said. ‘It’s
 common ground not only in the Conservative Party but in the country 
that the powers of the European Union have increased too much, that they
 are too great, that they must be diminished.’

Mr
 Hague clashed with former Tory Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who dismissed
 suggestions that the EU is to blame for ‘unsustainable’ levels of 
immigration.

Mr Clarke, who 
sits in the Cabinet as the prime minister’s trade envoy, said: ‘I just 
don’t think it’s true that the European Union is responsible for 
unacceptable waves of migration. The idea that you can have some 
fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here 
is rather typical right-wing, nationalist escapism.’

Mr
 Hague insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern 
European countries who joined the EU had triggered ‘large-scale 
migration’ and had been a ‘mistake’.

But
 Laszlo Andor, the EU’s social affairs commissioner, suggested Britons 
were ‘emotional and misguided’ over the issue and would ‘pay more 
attention to the facts’ in the absence of a big influx from Bulgaria and
 Romania.

Chief Secretary to
 the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said the idea of a national veto against
 EU proposals was ‘potty’. Labour peer Lord Wood, one of Ed Miliband’s 
closest advisers, agreed. He said: ‘The impossible Tory demands of 
Europe must leave EU allies thinking: “The Conservatives don’t want EU 
reform. They want to wreck it or leave it”.’

By Andrea Leadsom MPThe way the EU works now fails to meet the aspirations of the British people on crucial levels. If the EU is not fundamentally reformed, the clamour for UK withdrawal may become overwhelming. The next few years present a unique opportunity for such reform.

The eurozone crisis means that the status quo in the EU is no longer an option—those countries who use the euro are moving towards closer fiscal and financial integration. So where does that leave the wider EU, and the 175 million citizens of countries who are not euro members?

Even without that elephant in the room, the EU is facing a crisis of competitiveness and a crisis of legitimacy.

Mr Cameron is said to be struggling to maintain party unity on the issue

The EU is at a fork in the road. If there is not meaningful reform of the EU over the next few years it will continue to lose out against emerging, more competitive countries.

As an organisation, it is over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many citizens in EU countries.

The UK can be pivotal in securing profound and necessary reform. The Prime Minister is rightly leading the debate on EU reform with calls for greater competitiveness, flexibility and democratic accountability.

However, there are many on the continent who continue to regard the UK with deep suspicion. On a recent visit to the Netherlands to discuss EU reform with Dutch Parliamentarians, they showed how wary they are of British motives: ‘We are your allies, but don’t hug us too close,’ they say.

Mr Osborne is set to delivery a major speech on Britain's future in a reformed Europe tomorrow

As British politicians, we need to engage better with our European colleagues to understand where their interests are, and to persuade them of the merits of the case for reform.

This week, I am co-hosting a conference in London to discuss detailed proposals for reform of the EU. It will bring together participants from over 30 countries, including all 28 EU member states, and will feature keynote speeches from ministers, Commissioners; MPs; MEPs; and leading business figures.

My discussions with MPs from other European member states often start with a degree of scepticism on their part—they say ‘you are just cherry-picking the best deal for the UK’ or ‘you just want to leave the EU, so why should we bother.’ Following discussion of specific proposals however, we discover there is a great deal of common ground.

We are pressing for:    

• incorporation into the EU's fabric acceptance of the principle that ever closer union is no longer relevant or necessary

• the creation of a permanent means by which a group of Member States' Governments can reject EU proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary

• far-reaching reinforcement of the Single Market, particularly in services, which is a British strength

• strengthening of accountability between voters and those who represent them at European level

• strong commitment to improving the performance of the EU through scrapping EU quangos, agreeing severe penalties for fraud and error in EU budgets and committing to a full review of how taxpayers' money is used by the EU

• elimination of the unintended consequences of the free movement legislation.

Of course not everyone will agree with everything. The art of negotiation is to craft a deal that will satisfy most people.

The challenge is to develop a reformed EU that is globally competitive and democratically accountable. If we do this, we will have a union that is fit for the 21st Century, and one that the British people can be comfortable with at last.
