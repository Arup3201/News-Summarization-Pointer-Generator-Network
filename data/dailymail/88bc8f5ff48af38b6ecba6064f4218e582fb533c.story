An eclectic group of influential British women, including Baroness Lawrence, mother of murdered teen Stephen, are the stars of the new M&S campaign.

Shot by iconic fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz, the SS14 campaign also features singer Rita Ora, actress Emma Thompson, supermodel Alek Wek, designer Lulu Kennedy, chef Rachel Khoo, and engineer Roma Agrawal.

Launching nationwide on March 31, the latest batch of 'Leading Ladies' includes British women from diverse backgrounds and professions, united by personal style and inspirational achievements.

'Whether it is through a selfless dedication to a cause, entrepreneurial and creative flair or pushing the boundaries of design, each woman is truly inspiring and unique in her own way,' says the high street giant of its new campaign stars.

A spokesperson for M&S said: ‘Our SS14 campaign is a celebration of style and accomplishment.

'These dynamic Leading Ladies represent the unique and diverse women of a modern Britain. They are united in their extraordinary achievements but confident in their differences.

'Marks & Spencer is a democratic brand which is relevant to women of all ages and strands of life; it is therefore natural for M&S to celebrate women in this way.

'M&S is extremely proud to have convened such an extraordinary group of exceptional women; this campaign is the embodiment of true British style, quality, diversity and success.'

The new campaign was shot in quintessentially British settings from a coastal scene in Camber Sands to the idyllic countryside of the Cotswolds.

The store's latest collection has clearly taken inspiration from the catwalk.

The new summer advert follows the saucy Christmas advert where Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stripped down to her underwear, which cost the high street giant more than £1million to make.

The high-profile M&S leading ladies campaign, which kicked off in Autumn last year, has also starred actress Helen Mirren, Olympic Gold winning boxer Nicola Adams, model Katie Piper, artist Tracey Emin, singer Ellie Goulding, US Vogue creative director Grace Coddington and Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save the Children International.
