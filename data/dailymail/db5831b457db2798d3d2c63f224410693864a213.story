Rio Ferdinand says young players in England are being paid too much too soon and believes the game needs to change.

Ferdinand has enjoyed a successful career since breaking through from the West Ham academy in 1996.

The former England captain joined QPR on a free transfer this summer but has commanded transfer fees of over £47million over his career and won six Premier League titles.

But he fears players are coming through these days are being giving too much too young and reaping financial rewards before they have achieved anything on the pitch.

He said: 'Kids are coming into money so quickly, before they have even proved themselves. It happens within six months of being at a club.

'I sympathise a bit because I know what it is like. All things are bright and wonderful are there for you and it is hard to turn down.

'It took me time to realise my responsibilities. So it is hard in that sense, but it is easy in terms of financial reward. The balance just isn’t there anymore.'
