Victim Jonny Shaw, who tracked down the thief who stole his power tools using eBay and then confronted him 

A handyman who had his power tools stolen found the items for sale on eBay - and then tracked down the thief himself after police told him they weren't going to investigate.

Jonny Shaw feared he would have to fork out £4,000 to replace his collection of electric saws, screwdrivers, drills and other tools after they were taken from his Ford Transit van in Colne, Lancashire.

In the hope they might turn up online, Mr Shaw began trawling through the online auction site two days after the theft as police told him they weren't going to do anything about it.

The former special constable then found his tools on sale, and decided to pose as a prospective buyer.

He then won the auction with his bid and told police where he would be meeting the man for the stolen goods, and suggested they be there to arrest the thief.

And after agreeing that he would cough when it was time to pounce, officers then swooped on Julian Morris, 35, and arrested him on his doorstep.

When they went inside his house, they found most of Mr Shaw's tools.

Today Morris, of Oswaldwistle in Lancashire, was warned he faced jail after admitting handling stolen goods - including a multi-tool, planers, saws, jigsaws, drills and nailers - at Burnley Magistrates' Court.

Mr Shaw explained: 'That morning I reported it to the police but they weren't doing anything about it and were just giving me a crime reference number - although an officer did come out to see me.

'I just gave up because they get so much of this sort of thing and I understand it's hard for them to chase up. I knew I'd be given a crime reference number so because of that I wanted to look for the tools myself.

'I was mad. I've had my tools stolen before and had to buy them again. I was going mad, this was my livelihood and a lot of people were let down because of it.

'I have 10 men under me and we were having to hire tools in for three or four days. The lads couldn't work that day, it had a big effect for three or four days. It was an absolute nightmare.'

Two days later, Mr Shaw began his own investigation and logged on to eBay suspecting the tools may have been put up for auction.

To his surprise he then found the tools were being sold by a user with the eBay ID JuMorris79.

The 26-year-old said he recognised the tools straight away as he had marked some of them with his initials.

He said: 'I thought the tools would probably be sold on the internet so I had a look. I couldn't believe he had put them on so soon. I got robbed on a Tuesday and by the Thursday they were on eBay. I kept a watch on them on the site and two days later he put some more on.

'At first I thought that they couldn't be mine but they had obvious modifications done to them and I was zooming in on the pictures and the serial numbers.

'I thought "they are definitely mine" and I thought "I've got to win them" and put a decent bid in. I was winning them and beating people. I did it on my girlfriend's account so he wouldn't know it was me. It was quite nerve wracking.'

Mr Shaw successfully won the auction and contacted the seller to get his address, telling him he could come and collect them.

He added: 'I told police and they said they'd have to get a warrant and that would take two days.

'I thought, "I'm winning these back." I rang the inspector and said that I knew they were mine straight away. He was really good and said he'd meet me round the corner of the address.

'On the day of the pick-up I had my mate with me because he wanted to come and I had all the barcodes of the tools written on my hand and my friend had to text the inspector saying "yes come round". We parked at the end of the drive so he couldn't shoot off. It was like something off the TV.

'This guy came out of the house and he had my tools. He kept coming to the door with everything else that had been robbed. I identified all the tools. I said to my mate that if I start coughing that means they are my tools.

'As soon as he came out I started coughing. The police came flying around the corner in a van and a car and started running up the drive. He had his back to them so he didn't know what was going on and they pinned him. Just before, I had said "they are my tools".

'He didn't know what to do, he said, "Let me say sorry to my wife". His wife and kids were there, I felt awkward because she was crying. 

'When I found the tools the Burnley police were brilliant. After the inspector was saying "good work". I always wanted to be in the police but when I did it I didn't like it - it was too much paperwork.'

At Burnley Magistrates' Court Tracey Yates, prosecuting, said Mr Shaw contacted police, who were then on standby when he went to collect the tools.

She added: 'When the defendant opened the door and brought the items, he identified them as clearly having been stolen from his van. The defendant was arrested.'

Morris's address was searched and officers returned further tools to Mr Shaw. Six items which had been stolen were not recovered and that included a £25 wallet and £275 cash.The defendant's van was searched and four snap bags cannabis were found.

In interview Morris said he got the tools from somebody he knew - but refused to name -and claimed he was gullible. He said he would have got the money either through PayPal or cash. 

He had 14 offences on his record.

Morris, who was not legally represented, told the court: 'We had just had a baby and I was skint.'

He described himself a a 'car booter' said someone he had met at a sale asked him if he wanted to sell some stuff on eBay for them and he would get 20 per cent.

He added: 'He told me he had bought them at a car boot. To be honest, I didn't ask any questions. I'm sorry.'

Morris who also admitted possessing cannabis was bailed until November, for reports.

The chair of the bench told him there were 'all options open' for sentencing and added: 'That can be right through to custody.'
