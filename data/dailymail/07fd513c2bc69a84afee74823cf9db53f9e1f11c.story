 A University of Virginia (UVA) student claims he tried to call 911 after 'Jackie' told him she was gang raped at a frat house but she stopped him because she 'just wanted to go to bed'.

Ryan Duffin - who is revealing his name for the first time - says he had his phone in his hand and told his friend, referred to as Jackie, that she should call the police after claiming she was sexually assaulted by a group of students.

But as the 20-year-old started to dial 911, Jackie told him that she 'didn't want to', he has claimed.

University of Virginia student Ryan Duffin, 20, says he got out his phone and told 'Jackie' to phone 911 after she claimed she was gang raped in a frat house, but she 'didn't want to', he claims

Almost a month after the scathing Rolling Stone article was published, Ryan Duffin and his friends Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock are still trying to set the record straight.

The friends told The Associated Press that the article was wrong on a number of key points, especially its assertion that they urged the victim to not report the attack. 

Duffin, a third-year student was referred to as 'Randall' in the Rolling Stone article.

He told the AP: 'I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect.' 

The AP also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Hendley and Stock, known as 'Cindy' and 'Andy' in the article.

A Rolling Stone magazine article suggested the trio did little to help their friend Jackie (pictured)  after she was sexually assaulted

The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus.

In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named 'Drew,' who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house.

Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched.

As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table about a 20-minute walk from the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened.

While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out.

'The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep,' the article said.

'Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: 'She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.'' 

However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie.

Stock confirmed this account.

As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie.

He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Fitzhugh dorm. She was shaking and 'it looked like she had been crying,' Duffin said.

'Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date.'

Jackie eventually told Duffin and Stock her version of what happened that night: that she was forced to perform oral sex on five men at the frat house.

'My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'' he said.

'I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there.' He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1, 'but she didn't want to and,' he remembers thinking, ''I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.''

Stock corroborated this version of events.

'Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'' Stock said. ''I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.''

Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant.

Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to.

Duffin said the RA told him that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so.

The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened — or whether any discrepancies in her story matter.

'People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do,' Duffin says. 'But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole.'

Alex Stock, another friend of Jackie who spoke to her shortly after she says she was gang raped, claims she said she 'just wanted to go to bed'

Other news media have also interviewed the friends, but this is the first time Duffin has allowed his full name to be used.

The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va.

The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police.

Erdely and Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana did not respond to an email from The Associated Press on Sunday morning seeking comment.

None of the three friends was contacted by Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, for which Rolling Stone has since apologized for and noted discrepancies.

All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and that she has told them she is re-reporting the story.

Hendley told the AP that Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did.

A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as 'Jackie,' has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.
