Republican dissidents are plotting a terrorist outrage in the run-up to the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this summer, British sources have warned.

Ministers are said to be alarmed by the resurgence in hardline republicanism in recent months, with hundreds of youngsters signing up to join the shadowy 'New IRA', which has vowed to continue the armed struggle to create a united Ireland.

Two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former IRA weapons, which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process.

At risk: The recent terrorist attacks linked to IRA means that violent action in the run-up to the meeting of G8 leaders, pictured in the U.S. last year, cannot be ruled out

Semtex plastic explosive supplied by Libyan dictator Colonel Gadaffi in the 1980s was used in a failed car bomb attack on an off-duty Northern Ireland policeman last month.

And a rifle used in the murder of prison officer David Black in November has been linked to previous IRA attacks more than a decade ago.

The planned arrival of world leaders for the G8 summit in June is posing a major headache for security forces dealing with the upsurge in republicanism and the recent outbreak of loyalist violence in the Belfast flags protests.

Ministers are confident that the venue for the summit at the Lough Erne resort, near Enniskillen, is secure, and insist there is no consideration being given to changing the venue to the mainland.

But they acknowledge there is a growing risk that republican extremists will attempt to mount a terrorist 'spectacular' in the run-up to the event, when the eyes of the world are on Northern Ireland.

Possible target: The G8 leaders will gather at Lough Erne Resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, this June for the summit

Planning ahead: Two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former IRA weapons, which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process

A British source said: 'The venue is secure - we are absolutely confident about that. But we cannot rule out a cowardly attack beforehand. The republican threat is growing.' Any attack would raise questions about the decision to stage the G8 in Northern Ireland, which was meant to show the world that life in the Province had been transformed for good.

Dissident republican groups have never entirely gone away, but until recently they were comprised mainly of veteran hardliners who were never reconciled to the peace process.

The so-called New IRA was formed last year from a loose alliance of hardline republican groups.

Unlike former groups it is enjoying success in attracting fresh support from the Province's disaffected youth. Sources claim the group has attracted up to 700 new members and is 'actively recruiting'.

Like previous groups it operates on fear, doling out punishment beatings and shootings on a weekly basis, as well as plotting attacks on the security services and other British targets.

Sources acknowledge that its leaders are beyond the control of Sinn Fein.

There are fears that the group also has ambitions to mount a new campaign on the mainland. Recent events suggest it may have access to the equipment needed to conduct a campaign, but there are doubts about whether it yet has the logistical and organisational skills to sustain a series of attacks on the mainland.
