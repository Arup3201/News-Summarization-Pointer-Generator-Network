Unwanted exposure: Cressida Bonas in the Beautiful Bottoms flyer, which was shot three years ago but has resurfaced

A lingerie company called Beautiful Bottoms is circulating an early modelling picture of Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, taken three years ago. 

The Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal the photograph of the Prince’s 24-year-old girlfriend  modelling a green and white floral bikini for the upmarket company owned by three of her friends – Poppy Sexton-Wainwright, Isabel Bradshaw and Lauren Skerritt. 

Cressida flirted with the idea of becoming a model and it is understood she offered to help her friends by posing for this photo in 2010, long before she entered into a romance with Prince Harry.

Friends of Cressida, now an aspiring 
dancer studying at Trinity Laban Conservatoire school in Greenwich, say 
she will be disappointed that the photograph is back in circulation. 

One close friend said: ‘She is especially sensitive to exposure at the moment – she totally wants to avoid the limelight.’

Friends
say that Cressida’s sudden rise to fame after being linked to Harry 
last summer could be the motivation behind the decision to resurrect the
photograph from the cutting-room floor. 

The
bikini she is modelling is no longer sold on the website owned by the 
three founders – who were all at Newcastle University together at the 
same time that Cressida was at Leeds University. 

Lauren
Skerritt told The Mail on Sunday: ‘That photo was taken a long time 
ago. Cressida doesn’t model for us any more. I don’t think she will 
really want the publicity from it.’

Nevertheless, last week the photograph of a waif-like Cressida, then aged 21, was being circulated on promotional flyers for the brand, which was founded in 2009.

The flyer reads: ‘This card entitles you to 30 per cent off all Beautiful Bottoms collections’, although the style Cressida is wearing is no longer on sale on the website.

Last week the flyers were being handed out in goody bags at a party in London hosted by another of Cressida’s friends, Daisy Fellowes, when she launched a collection of silk jackets for her fashion brand Lilah.

Cressida was due to appear at the party but made a last-minute decision not to go.

A friend at the event said: ‘Cress has now quietly hired an adviser to help navigate her way through all the attention surrounding her. She doesn’t want to be photographed at events right now.

‘She was very hurt and saddened by pictures of her drinking shots which emerged recently in a magazine, which were unfairly compared to Sarah Ferguson, who is a family friend. It was incredibly embarrassing and cruel. She was at university – who doesn’t drink shots at university?’

Another friend added: ‘Whether it works out between them or not, Harry will always adore Cressida and he is very protective of her. He would have been mortified that such a cheap comparison was made.’

And now it seems that by digging up the picture of Cressida in a bikini, her friends have increased the attention surrounding her. 

The silk underwear sold on the website, and in 19 UK concessions, is hand-made in China, and a set costs about £85.

Other celebrities to model for the company include Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh and TV presenter Abbey Clancy.

A blog on the Beautiful Bottoms website, written by Lauren Skerritt in 2011, reads: ‘Poppy and I got a tour of the entire factory, including where they keep the silk cocoons before opening them and making them into fibres, the silk reems [sic], the dyeing room, and the sewing rooms where our Beautiful Bottoms come to life!’

The ‘Prince Harry effect’ worked wonders for the modelling career of his previous girlfriend, Florence Brudenell-Bruce, who landed a lucrative contract with British handbag designer Aspinal of London shortly after their brief fling fizzled out in August 2011.

She also fronted a campaign for underwear label La Senza.

Cressida’s mother is Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, 66, who was a society It Girl in her time. 

She was married to Cressida’s father, Jeffrey Bonas – chairman of old-fashioned haberdashers MacCulloch & Wallis – for six years.
