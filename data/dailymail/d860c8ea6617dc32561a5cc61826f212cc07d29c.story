Life lessons: Author Elizabeth Kesses wasn't confident growing up

The pressure of trying to achieve an unrealistic 'ideal body' is one that has long plagued girls through their teenage years and beyond.

It's something author Elizabeth Kesses is familiar with having struggled with her own appearance and self confidence growing up in Athens and London. 

After graduating from Oxford and establishing a successful career in advertising, it's only now at the age of 40 she is finally feels more secure in her own skin. As a result, she has overhauled her life by moving to France and becoming a writer. 

She has written three self-esteem books for young girls called The Ugly Little Girl Trilogy and is supporting Body Confidence Week, which culminated in the Body Confident Awards at the House of Commons last night.

Here, she reveals the six things she wishes she had known when she was a young girl struggling to make her way in the world... 

1. If others say you're ugly, a loser, a swot... it's only because they are somehow threatened by you

I went to a bitchy girls school and I realise now when I talk to some of the girls in my year that they actually remembered me as the clever one who got to date the nice boys. But at the time, I believed any bad words that were said about me. Somehow their vision of me was more important than my own. I know now that everyone brings their stuff, their jealousies and insecurities - so take everything with a huge pinch of salt. 

2. If you please others the whole time you'll never end up pleasing yourself

As a teenager, I chose to go to Oxford University in part for my parents. I loved it there but I felt constantly under pressure in such an academic environment. I then chose advertising as a career as I needed a proper job with money and status, so that others thought I was 'doing well'. 

Pressure to look good: Elizabeth advises young girls to focus more on their personality than their appearance

I married my boss because he was older, established and my friends/family would think he was a good catch. Deep down none of these decisions were right for me. 

I had no idea what I wanted, so I chose what everyone else wanted for me. In the end you'll rebel. I did at the age of 35. 

I'm now doing what I believe in - I write, I moved to France to be with my French husband and I chose not to have kids. None of these are particularly popular choices but they are who I am and that's more important. 

3. Laughter lights up a room, not fake eyelashes and hair extensions

I used to obsess about being fat, ugly, short, frizzy-haired, and I thought everyone was horrified when I walked in a room. I couldn't flick through a teen mag without feeling inadequate. 

The pressure for girls today is even greater with websites dedicated to 'thinspiration', the obsession with image on social media and the relentless pursuit of perfection in the fashion world. 

Now I know that most people aren't looking at that one spot or unkempt eyebrow or thighs that touch. Most normal nice people don't care - they worry about what's on the inside. 

Feelings of inadequacy: Teens should talk to someone if they feel down

4. If there is something you really want to do... then just do it 

Never give up, if it's your true passion, your gift will happen. I loved ballet, I had the chance to do it professionally but reason prevailed and I focused on my academic studies. I'm sure it wasn't my vocation but denying myself the chance to explore it has left a pain, a form of nostalgia. Every time I go to see the Nutcracker at Christmas I get a twinge in my heart.

I also loved writing as a little girl but the path to doing that seemed complicated and uncertain - yet now I'm a published author.

5. If someone's bullying you or if you're feeling down... talk to someone

I used to bottle up a lot of my feelings, pretending all was OK and I carried on smiling so I didn't disappoint or worry anyone. Having been through therapy I appreciate the well worn phrase 'a problem shared is a problem halved'.

Issue needs to be taken seriously: More should be done to help young people with low confidence

6. Low self-esteem IS a serious issue

From the age of ten to about fifteen I went through a gawky stage. Like most other teens, I believed I was so much uglier, so much geekier than everyone else. It made feel very alone and miserable. I suffered from lack of self esteem in my late teens becoming anorexic and I still struggle with bouts of low confidence. 

It's time for the nation to take seriously the issue of low self-esteem as it is one of the biggest threats to a woman's well-being. 

It is time confidence-building and self-belief were formally incorporated as part of the school curriculum, that media changed the beauty conversation and that girls are given every chance in the world to be happy. I'm glad this is now being addressed with the launch of Body Confidence Week.
