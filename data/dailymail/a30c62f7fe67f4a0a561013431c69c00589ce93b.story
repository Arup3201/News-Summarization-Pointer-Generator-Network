New career: Former CIA director David Petraeus has been named a visiting professor for public policy at City University of New York

Disgraced ex-CIA director David Petraeus is replacing one kind of intelligence work with another.

Macaulay Honors College at City University of New York said Tuesday the retired four-star general has been named a visiting professor for public policy.

Petraeus will assume the position August 1, Matthew Goldstein, the chancellor said.

'With his appointment, our students will have a unique opportunity 
to learn about public policy firsthand from a distinguished leader with 
extraordinary experience and expertise in international security issues,
intelligence matters and nation-building,' Goldstein said in a statement.

Petraeus, a graduate of the prestigious West Point military academy, has written widely on international relations, military strategy and tactics and national security issues.

He said in a statement released by Macaulay he's pleased to teach at the college, where most students are children of immigrants. He says he looks forward to leading a seminar on the global economic slowdown.

'I look forward to leading a seminar at 
Macaulay that examines the developments that could position the United 
States -- and our North American partners -- to lead the world out of 
the current global economic slowdown,' the statement reads.

The general's attorney, Robert Barnett, told the New York Times that his client had been approached by many universities, but he decided to accept CUNY's offer because he admires its diversity of students, among other factors. 

Ann Kirschner, dean of Macaulay, told the Times Petraeus' seminar will be in keeping with his interest in energy, advanced manufacturing, life sciences and information technology. 

In addition, the former chief of the CIA will be available to meet with students about their research projects. 

According to Kirschner, Petraeus' salary for the one-year position is 'still in discussion.'

He earned a PhD in international 
relations from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International 
Affairs at Princeton University, taught as an assistant professor at the
United States Military Academy and held a fellowship at Georgetown 
University.

Petraeus was a hero of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He left the CIA last November after it was uncovered he'd had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

The announcement comes a month after Petraeus' first public appearance since the scandal, when he apologized for his infidelity while delivering a keynote address at a University of Southern California event honoring the military.

Petraeus, 60, has been married to wife Holly for 38 years and they have two children, Anne and Stephen Petraeus

The extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell that ended Petraues' career as a CIA director came to light as a result of an FBI investigation into emails she sent to another woman, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, whom she viewed as a rival for his attention.
