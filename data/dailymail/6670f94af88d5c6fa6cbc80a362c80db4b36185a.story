It's been the year that us bought us selfies, belfies and bookshelfies but now it's time for the 'pelfie' - that's a pet dressed as an elf.

Devoted dog and cat owners entered snaps of their four-legged friends dressed in their seasonal best into a Pet Elfie competition and the results were just adorable. 

From terriers in elf jackets to a  lizard in a tiny red hat, Britain's pets are perfect as Santa's little helpers.

Sweet-natured Honey the Jack Russell won the BuyAGift 'pet elfie' competition. Her owner Caroline Virgo claimed the £250 voucher as well as a £250 charity donation to the dog rescue charity of her choice

The company was inundated with entries for their Christmas competition including these two cute pooches, one of which wore a snowman outfit complete with top hat and carrot nose, while the other wore a Santa hat

Buyagift.com offered a £250 gift voucher and a £250 charity donation for the best snaps and Britain's animal lovers entered in their droves.

Some  took the Christmas theme even further, dressing their animals up as Father Christmas on his sleigh with a reindeer.

The company say that they were inundated with entries but they eventually awarded the prize to adorable Jack Russell, Honey. 

Her owner Caroline Virgo said: 'Honey loves lots of attention and fuss and is extremely placid. 

'As she is short-haired she wears a jumper when we take her for walks when it's cold, so she doesn't mind wearing elf outfits at all.'

'When I found out she had won I was over the moon to say the least.

'My husband had an accident a couple of weeks ago, and now I will be able to take him for a relaxing weekend away with the prize.'

Mrs Virgo added that her charity of choice is Forest Dog Rescue - Green Gap Kennels in Far Forest, Worcestershire, a small charity rescue centre that  cares for abandoned dogs.

These two pals both have Christmas outfits, while one wears reindeer ears the other has its Santa hat on

While not as cute and cuddly as a dog or cat, buying a hat small enough for this lizard is a feat in itself

She said: 'They don't receive any financial support from councils or the government and work hard raising funds doing car boot sales and raffles to enable them to continue their fantastic work trying to re home dogs.'

While Honey was the overall winner, many of the other pet owners went to great lengths to impress the judges.

One labrador was dressed as a snowman complete with carrot and a green tinsel necklace, while a collie looked the part in a green-and-white striped elf suit.

While another managed to dress their long-haired cat in a red Santa suit - a prize-winning feat in itself.
