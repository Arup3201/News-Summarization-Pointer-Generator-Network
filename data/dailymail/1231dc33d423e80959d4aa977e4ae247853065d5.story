He is loved by adults and children alike.

But an exhibition for popular plasticine model Gromit, the faithful sidekick to Wallace, was so overwhelmed with visitors it had to be closed to try and calm the queues.

Organisers of the Greatest Dog Show on Earth initially closed the exhibition after thousands swarmed to see it.

Fans: About 3,000 Gromit fans turned out to see the exhibition in Bristol forcing organisers to close the doors temporarily

It has now re-opened, but people will 
have to wait up to six hours to gain entry to the event in Bristol after
 hordes queued to see the show.

With
 an estimated 3,000 people waiting patiently outside those at the back 
of the queue in Elmdale Road could see the front in Queen's Avenue.

The queue snaked the whole length of Elmdale Road, into Tyndall's Park Road and along Whiteladies Road.

The show will see 80 giant Gromit sculptures brought together for 'The Greatest Dog Show on Earth' following the huge success of this summer's Gromit Unleashed arts trail

The 5ft high sculptures have been decorated by iconic designers including Sir Paul Smith, Gromit creator Nick Park, comedian Harry Hill, author and illustrator Sir Quentin Blake

Earlier organisers had closed the queue but have since allowed people to join.

They had stopped people from joining the winding queue for health and safety reasons, the BBC reported.

They tweeted: 'Exhibition queue is now 
nearly six hours long. Anyone joining the queue from now we cannot 
guarantee entry tonight.'

Other designers include the man behind The Snowman, Raymond Briggs, and Axel Scheffler, who helped create children's favourite The Gruffalo

Once of those hoping to catch a glimpse of the exhibition in the former Habitat store on the Clifton Triangle was Karen King.

Miss King, 32, from Gloucester, said: 'I really enjoyed the Gromit Unleashed trail and spent a day walking around Bristol seeing as many of the statues as I could, so I was looking forward to seeing the rest on display.

'By the time I joined the queue there were already thousands in front of me.

'I heard security say there were over 2,000 already waiting.

'The queue snaked around three streets. People were saying it was a two hour wait to get inside to see the Gromits.

'I waited for about an hour and hadn't moved that far, so decided to give up.

'I might try and go earlier tomorrow or maybe try and catch a glimpse after work on Monday.'

The exhibition, which began on Wednesday, is open to the public until Monday.

It features the 80 Gromit ceramic statues that made up a hugely popular arts trail around Bristol.

They will be auctioned on October 3 to raise money for Bristol Children's Hospital.
