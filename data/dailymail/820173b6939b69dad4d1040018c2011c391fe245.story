It sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, but scientists have discovered a way to treat jetlag with a flash of light.

Researchers claim to have found a master switch in the brain which can ‘reset’ the human body clock.

By flicking the switch with beams of light, the U.S. team has worked out how to influence the way people react to long-haul travel or working irregular hours.

Using optical lasers - high powered flashes of light shone into the eye - the scientists think they may be able to alter the way people naturally feel at different times of day.

Scientists claim they have found a way to cure jetlag - and possibly relieve the adverse health affects of working a night shift or help other conditions such as Seasonal Affective Disorder - by using flashes of light to flick the 'reset button' of the body clock

The initial tests on mice suggest the ‘reset button’ is in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, situated above the eye.

The scientists, from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, found that they could alter the timing of activity in the brains of mice.

Their results, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveal that the nocturnal mice they treated in this way were made to be more active during the day, when they would usually be asleep.

The team think that being able to reset the body’s master biological clock could eventually lead to new treatments for conditions like seasonal affective disorder, reduce the adverse health effects of working a night shift and possibly even cure jet lag.

Nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s rotation.

Nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which rules our daily rhythms, including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism.

In humans and other mammals, the clock is regulated by the bodily senses, most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes. 

Scientists found ‘re-setting’ the body’s clock can cause feelings of awakeness and alertness, even during times of day it is normal to sleep.

They discovered using an optical laser – high powered flashes of light shone into the eyes – can flick the ‘reset button’.

This is found in the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, situated above the eye.

In humans and other mammals, the clock is regulated by the bodily senses, most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes.

The mechanism rules our daily rhythms, including our sleep and waking patterns and metabolism. It also determines if we are a ‘morning’ person or an ‘evening’ person.

But the pressures of modern living mean we are now increasingly working against our clocks and risking long term health problems from metabolic disease.

Separate studies have found that people who work night shifts or who get too little sleep are more susceptible to conditions including depression, cancer and obesity.

Professor Douglas McMahon, who led the research, said: ‘We found we can change an animal’s sleep-wake rhythms by artificially stimulating the neurons in the master biological clock, which is located in an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.’

The team found that the suprachiasmatic nucleus was far more active during a mouse’s natural wake cycle.

The scientists found they could artificially make the nervous cells in that part of the brain fire whenever they wanted, therefore making the mouse think it was time to be awake.

They did this by genetically altering the cells to make them sensitive to light and then shining the laser into the eye.

Nearly all humans have an internal mechanism, known as circadian rhythm, which rules sleep and waking patterns. When sunlight is perceived by the eye, signals are sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where the circadian clock is housed (pictured in pink in the centre of the brain, with a red arrow running through it). Scientists found using optical lasers they could 'reset' the body clock in mice

The same thing could be replicated in humans by injecting them with a virus which alters the cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, then repeating the light treatment.

The technique puts control of the body clock under human control for the first time.

Researcher Michael Tackenberg said: ‘Of course, this exact approach isn’t ready for human use yet.

‘But others are making progress toward eventually using optogenetics as therapy.’
