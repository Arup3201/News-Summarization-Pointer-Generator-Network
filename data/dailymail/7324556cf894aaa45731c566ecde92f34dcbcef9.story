Carolyn Keeling allegedly first abused the boy after offering him wine and stripping down to her underwear during a tutoring session in 1993

A female tutor seduced a 13-year-old boy during a lesson at his home before abusing him during regular sex sessions that went on for two years, a court heard today.

Carolyn Keeling, 63, allegedly started abusing the boy in 1993 when she gave him wine and stripped down to her underwear to sunbathe during a tutoring session at his home, a jury heard.

The alleged abuse continued until 1996, when the boy was 15.

Gloucester Crown Court heard how Ms Keeling, then in her 40s, started touching the teenager through his shorts and the pair later had sex after she had fetched a condom from her car.

Prosecutor Virginia Cornwall said that for the next two years the pair regularly had sex at the boy’s home while his parents were out.

She claimed that at other times they had sex at Ms Keeling's home and at local hunt meetings which she attended. The pair would often drink and smoke cannabis together, she said.

Ms Keeling from Taynton, near Gloucester, has pleaded not guilty to six charges of indecent assault, all against the same boy, when he was aged between 13 and 15 from September 1993 to September 1996.

She was said to have had an 'otherwise glowing career' and 'has never been in trouble'.

The alleged victim, now aged 33 and a father-of-three, at first thought their relationship was 'brilliant' the court heard.

But he said that having two teenage boys of his own made him realise that what had happened to him when he was younger was wrong.

Mrs Cornwall said that the boy, who lived in Gloucestershire, had been excluded from school when he was 12 and Mrs Keeling was one of the home tutors appointed to teach him.

The court heard that she would visit his home two to three times a week and was given her own key to the house to let herself in.

She would sometimes go into the boy’s bedroom to wake him - even though he slept naked, Mrs Cornwall said.

Mrs Cornwall said that when Ms Keeling initiated the relationship the boy threw himself ‘wholeheartedly’ into it.

She said: 'This case is about a distorted relationship between an adult teacher and a child that was in her care.

'It is an unusual case and you may think that immediately because there is a woman in the dock.

'He was excluded from school and that is why he came into contact with her. He was using drugs and had been in trouble with the police.

'In her police interview she talks about him in terms that are relatively affectionate. She talks about him as someone with potential.

'She smoked cannabis with him on occasions and on occasions they drank together.

'She saw him in circumstances that were inappropriate and the two of them had regular sexual intercourse. They would spend a great deal of time together.

'It was a relationship that developed over time, but in reality it was abuse because she was a woman in her 40s and he was a child. It was wrong.'

The relationship ended when the boy ceased education at the age of 15 and said he did not want to take any exams, said the prosecutor. He then left home.

He had sex twice more with Ms Keeling when he was in his early twenties after he went back to his former tutor asking for a job reference.

But, said the prosecutor, he realised that the teacher did not have the same interest in him as an adult mature male as she did when he was an immature boy.

'She said, "Do you mind if I make myself more comfortable?" I said "Whatever" and she ended up taking her top off'

In 2012 he felt troubled about what had happened in his youth and he told his partner and his mother. That led to him going to a sexual abuse referral centre and, as a result, calling the police.

Mrs Cornwall said that when Ms Keeling was arrested, she denied that anything untoward had taken place and insisted their relationship was entirely innocent.

In evidence, the alleged victim said it was when his own sons reached the ages of 12 and 13 that he realised what had happened to him as a boy was wrong - even though he had thought it was ‘brilliant’ at the time.

He told the jury of the day when Ms Keeling seduced him as they sat on his patio on a ‘blazing hot day’ when he was 13.

'She said, "do you mind if I make myself more comfortable?" I said "whatever".

'She ended up taking her top off. She was in her bra. Then she took her trousers down and was in her underwear.

Carolyn Keeling, pictured outside court today, said that her relationship with the alleged victim was innocent

'I was thinking a few things. I was a young boy and I’m not saying I wasn’t. Of course I was.

'I did find myself getting aroused. I tried to hide it basically. But she cottoned on and she sort of giggled a bit.

'She said "don’t worry about it, don’t be embarrassed. It’s perfectly natural. Any man would in this sort of situation."

He said that at that point he reciprocated her advances, adding, 'It doesn’t take much to develop the situation from there, does it?'

He said that Ms Keeling then retrieved a condom from her car before they had sex for the first time outside on her patio.

He said: 'I thought it was brilliant - I was 13 years old.'

He told the jury that despite what had happened to him he felt bad about Ms Keeling being prosecuted because she had been a good teacher and a friend and he would not be able to read and write as well as he does if it had not been for her teaching.

But he added: 'I have got children now and if the same sort of thing happened to them at that age I would not be a happy person.

'As I get older I realised it was not right. I didn’t look at it as abuse at the time, but now as a man in his thirties I know if I touched a 13-year-old girl I would expect the full force of the law.'

He told the court that at the time of the alleged abusse, however, he thought the teacher, whom he called ‘Mrs K’, was as 'cool as a cucumber' because of the way she dressed, her music tastes and the fact she got cannabis for them to smoke together.

Earlier, Mrs Cornwall had told the jury that during the first sex session between Ms Keeling and the boy the condom split.

The trial continues.
