Crash: The pilot was named as David Black, from the small town of Trangie in western New South Wales

A 43-year-old father piloting a water bombing plane over burning bushland in Australia died today when the aircraft crashed after reportedly losing a wing.

The pilot was named as David Black, from the small town of Trangie in western New South Wales.

The crash sparked a new bushfire, its 
intensity and smoke so severe that specialists were unable to be lowered
from helicopters to recover the Mr Black's body.

He was the owner of Rebel Agriculture, which was contracted to help the rural fire service fight blazes south of Sydney.

Superintendent Cassart told a press conference that winds and fire had made it 'far too dangerous' to send anyone down on a winch to bring up Mr Black's body.

One of the big challenges in regards to that task was the winds in the area at that time,' he said.

Mr Black was flying an M-18 Dromader single-engined agricultural aircraft that can be adapted for fire-fighting purposes.

Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, who lost his own father in a bushfire, fought back tears as he paid tribute to the pilot, whose plane came down in bushland near the town of Ulladulla, south of Sydney.

‘It’s a tragedy for the fire fighting community, but first and foremost it’s a tragedy for this man’s family,’ said Mr Fitzsimmons.

fire commissioner Rob Rodgers said firefighting was ‘an inherently

the air.’

Police
Superintendent Joe Cassar said an ambulance officer had been winched 
into the remote area where the crash occurred and had been able to 
confirm the pilot was dead.

But emergency staff have been unable 
to recover his body because fires have erupted in the area, where the 
terrain is difficult to negotiate.

‘As soon as conditions are in our favour, we will retrieve the pilot,’ said Superintendent Cassar.

Meanwhile
fire officials warned people living in the Blue Mountains that even 
though they had been told they could return to homes that had not been 
destroyed they should remain on high alert as strong winds were still 
fanning flames that had not been extinguished.
