Honestly! You'd think I'd have grown out of celebrity crushes by now, wouldn't you? OK, I no longer stick posters of boy band hunks on my bedroom wall, but my fascination for famous faces remains.

Despite the fact that I now get targeted by paparazzi photographers and even sign the occasional autograph, I still love celebrity gossip and I'm obsessed with Hollywood fashion and beauty.

My latest superstar style crush is Mila Kunis, the gorgeous actress and girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher. Famed for her glossy brunette locks and sultry beauty, I think she's incredible, so for this week's blog I decided to recreate her signature smoky-eyed glamour.

This week Binky shows you how to achieve Mila's signature smokey eye

GET THE MILA LOOK

DO YOUR PREP

Prep your face with foundation and powder for that flawless Hollywood complexion, followed by a light coverage of Too Faced Shadow Insurance Eyeshadow Primer on the eyelids. This creates a perfect even canvas for colours, as well as fixing eye make-up in place and preventing eyeshadow creases.

POWER BROWS

Mila has fabulously strong, dark brows so use the dark brown eyeshadow shade from the Daniel Sandler Eyeshadow Quad in Beyond Sunset to emphasise your own. Simply follow the natural line of your brows, applying colour with a small, angled brush.

Binky recommends using a primer to fully prep your face in order to prevent makeup from slipping

LUXE LIDS

Next, using a larger brush, blend the nude/brown shade from the Daniel Sandler palette across your lids, creating a subtle base of pretty colour and adding depth to the eyes.

Going back to the darker brown shade, add a stronger wash of colour at the corners of your lids, winging it out towards your brows, along the lower lash line and around the eye. Next up, apply the sparkly grey-brown shade from the same palette along your upper and lower lash lines, using a small, angled brush.

Finally, apply the glistening golden shade from the Daniel Sandler palette to the centre of your lid. This look calls for quite a lot of colour on your eyes, so the key is to blend carefully so each shade merges subtly into the next. 

Binky says it's important to blend your eyeshadow so that one shade merges into the next

FINE LINES

Now draw a dark eyeliner along your upper and lower lash lines, and inside the water line - I used Clarins Crayon Kohl Long-Lasting Eye Pencil in Intense Black. This will emphasise your eyes and really strengthen that dark, smoky-eyed effect. Finish up with lashings of Too Faced Lash Injection mascara to really finesse your eye make-up.

LA GLOW

A Binky look has to include bronzer - even if it's a Mila Kunis-influenced Binky look! Take a large fluffy brush and swish it across both shades in the Daniel Sandler Sculpt & Slim Contour Kit, then apply the colour anywhere the sun would hit your face. Next brush a soft, shimmery blusher across the apples of your cheeks - I used Guerlain Blush Duo in Peach Boy - to add a healthy Californian glow to your complexion.

A PERFECT POUT

The focus of this look is the sultry eyes, so I've taken a tip from Mila's book and stuck to a nude lip colour. Apply Guerlain Rouge Automatique Lipstick straight from the tube and smudge your lips together to achieve a soft, neutral finish.

I reckon this a gorgeous result, one Mila Kunis herself would be proud of! If there's a Hollywood star whose hair or make-up look you'd like to recreate, just drop me a line and I'll try to help out. You'll find all the products I've used today at online beauty boutique escentual.com.

The focus of this look is sultry eyes so Binky recommends keeping to subtle colours for your lips

On another note, I’m currently testing my willpower by taking part in the Decafflon launched by Emmi

CAFFÈ LATTE

Decaff – it’s a challenge encouraging the nation to give up caffeine for 10 days. So far, so good…I’ve replaced my usual coffee with the tasty new Emmi CAFFÈ LATTE Decaff and have been exercising first thing in the morning to kick-start my metabolism. If you fancy attempting the Decafflon yourself (which I highly recommend!) you can find out more info here: www.facebook.com/emmicaffelatteuk

Until next time, stay gorgeous!
