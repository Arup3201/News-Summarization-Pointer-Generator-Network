Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie radiated Royal glamour as they attended the society wedding of the year.

Members of the crowd shouted 'gorgeous' as the two young princesses arrived at the wedding of Thomas van Straubenzee and  the Duke of Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy.

Princess Beatrice aptly chose Royal blue for the occasion and showed off her legs in a shorter long-sleeved dress that she wore with a black and white flower fascinator.

A sequinned blue jacket brought a touch of glamour to the otherwise relaxed look.

The pair hugged some of the other 500 guests before walking into pretty at the gate of St Michael's Parish Church.

They were joined by their cousins The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry at the ceremony.

Groom Mr van Straubenzee is a long-term friend of the princes and travelled to New Zealand with William on a gap year.

He was reportedly on the phone to Prince Harry when he was mugged in London last year and the young Royal was believed to have alerted police and went to find his friend after the ordeal.
