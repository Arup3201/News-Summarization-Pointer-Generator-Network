The family of the black teenager shot dead by a policeman in St Louis are haunted by the image of him holding his hands up at the moment he was killed, a family member claimed today.

Ty Pruitt said that the mental picture of Michael Brown surrendering was stuck in his relatives’ minds as it showed he was ‘killed like an animal’.

Pruitt spoke out at an emotional Sunday church service during which Brown’s mother Lesley McSpadden sobbed and wiped the tears away from her eyes with a tissue.

His father Michael Brown Sr stood grim faced whilst wearing a T-shirt with his son’s picture on it and the slogan: ‘No Justice, No Peace’.

The service was the first time the family had attended church on a Sunday since the death of Brown, 18, who was killed on August 9th.

He was shot in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, by officer Darren Wilson, 28, even though witnesses claim he had his hands up and was giving up.

Brown's death has sparked seven nights of protests and rioting in Ferguson after it ignited long standing racial tensions between African American residents and the mostly white police force.

Protesters around the world have been putting their hands up and chanting: ‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ in what has become their trademark gesture.

The service at a the Greater Grace church just north of Ferguson was packed with 1,000 people and another 500 outside who were unable to get in.

Among the guests was Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson, who is in charge of policing the riots, and civil rights campaigner Rev Jesse Jackson.

McSpadden sat next to Brown Sr, her ex-husband, wearing sunglasses, a white shirt and dark trousers. On their right was the Rev Al Sharpton.

Addressing the crowd Pruitt, Brown's cousin, said: ‘What I want you all to remember is that Michael Brown was not just some young black boy. He was a human being, he was a younger cousin, he was a son, he was an uncle, a nephew, he was not a suspect, he was not an object, he was not an animal - but that’s how he was killed.’

Holding his hands up, he said: ‘This was the last action that our family member made before he went to rest.

‘This will be stuck in my family’s memories for the rest of our lives’.

The family were also represented by their lawyer Benjamin Crump, who was the attorney for relatives of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead in Florida by a neighbourhood watch coordinator.

Crump told the crowd that there was ‘nothing that can justify the execution style murder in broad daylight’ of Brown.

He also accused the Ferguson police department of trying to ‘smear’ Brown by putting out a CCTV video that apparently showed him robbing cigars from a grocery store minutes before he was killed.

As Brown Sr cheered, Crump said: ‘They tried it with Trayvon, now they’re trying it with Michael.’  

Taking a stand: Brown's parents stood at the podium, alongside their attorney Benjamin Crump. Crump previously represented the parents of Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin

Impassioned: Pruitt said in his speech that his cousin Michael Brown was 'was not an animal - but that's how he was killed'

Police: Missouri State Highway Patrol captain Ron Johnson appeared at the service and said he felt for Brown's parents

The service came against a background of ongoing unrest in Ferguson.

On Saturday night Missouri governor Jay Nixon imposed a midnight curfew but a crowd of 200 defied the order and stayed on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson.

Heavily armed SWAT teams fired on them with tear gas and caused them to run into the nearby housing estate.

During his speech Johnson won three standing ovations and addressed Brown's family directly.

He said: 'My heart goes out to you. I wear this uniform and I should stand up here and say that I'm sorry'.

Thomas Jackson, the embattled Ferguson police chief, has so far refused to apologise.

Speaker: The Rev. Al Sharpton also appeared at the service at Greater Grace Church
