Keith Hartigan, 37, has been charged with first-degree rape

A Colorado real estate mogul has been cleared of first-degree rape charges stemming from his February encounter with a Citibank vice president inside the posh Standard Hotel in New York City.

During a hearing Friday, Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Murphy announced that the alleged victim decided not to purpose the case, and that it is unclear whether Keith Hartigan had committed any crime.

The prosecutor added that an investigation into the allegations showed that 'there are no probable criminal charges, the New York Post reported.'

Hartigan, who sells and rents 
high-end homes to Hollywood stars and recording artists in the ski 
resort of Aspen, Colorado, was arrested at around 4.30am February 1 on suspicion 
of first-degree rape. 

The Post reported at the time that he met the 31-year-old banker after his friend cozied up to her at 675 Bar in the city.

She and his friend then joined Hartigan on the ninth floor of the trendy Meatpacking District hotel, where rooms cost as much as $1,700 a night, before falling asleep. 

The woman claimed to have been woken by the strapping property magnate as he allegedly groped 
her, ripped off her underwear and then raped her before she managed to 
flee and call 911.  

Hartigan was arrested and released after posting $7,500 bail.

The 37-year-old real estate broker to the stars chose not to make an appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court Friday.

His attorney, Edward Sapone, said that both surveillance video from the high-end hotel and interviews with witnesses show that his client's encounter with the 31-year-old Citibank employee was consensual and did involve any wrongdoing.

'Sometimes people engage in conduct that they unfortunately regret,' the attorney said in reference to the false allegations against his client.

Sapone went on to tell the New York Daily News that
while the ordeal has taken a heavy financial and emotional toll on his 
client, he does not intend to file a lawsuit against his accuser for 
making the false claim.

'He just wants to get on with his life, he's not looking for retribution,' Sapone said. 

If the case were to go forward and the 37-year-old man was convicted, he could have faced up to 25 years in prison. 

Hartigan owns View West Properties, which sells luxury property in the exclusive ski resort of Aspen.

While the company's website has been taken offline, its
Facebook page features a range of properties it has sold, including 
Jack Nicholson's house, and a picture of Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon 
dressed in ski wear as they rented one of the View West homes.
