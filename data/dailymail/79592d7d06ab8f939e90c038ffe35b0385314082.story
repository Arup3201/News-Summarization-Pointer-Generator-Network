A hooded mob fired a gun at a police helicopter during last summer's riots after 'luring' officers to the scene by firebombing a pub, a court has heard.

The group of armed rioters fired at least 12 shots at police in the air and on the ground after violence erupted in Birmingham last year, jurors were told.

It was claimed officers were forced to run for safety as windows behind them were shattered by bullets being fired from four different guns.

Violence: An armed mob 'lured' police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer's riots, a court has heard

It was claimed officers were forced to run for safety as windows behind them were shattered by bullets being fired from four different guns

Police had been dispatched to deal 
with reports of a fire at the Barton Arms pub in the Newtown area of the
city on August 9 last year.

When the officers arrived on the scene
they were faced with a group of masked and hooded youths armed with 
bats and various items of furniture taken from the Grade II listed pub.

Prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said 
that, after getting into formation, officers heard gunshots and were 
forced to take cover before being given the order to retreat for their 
own safety.

The court heard police realised they 
were being shot at when they heard the windows of the building behind 
them being smashed by the gun fire.

Mr Lockhart said: 'These were not 
imitation firearms with blank ammunition, these were bullets and they 
were going into the building behind them.

'Those weapons, or some of them, had 
been aimed at those officers and the bullets went over their heads and 
impacted with that building.'

The court was shown CCTV of a large 
group of men fleeing from police, with two men at the rear of appearing 
to take aim and fire at officers.

Further footage was shown of the group
fleeing into nearby housing estates in an attempt to escape police. One
member of the group, which 
prosecutors claim is defendant Tyrone Laidley, was shown taking aim at 
the police helicopter before letting off a shot.

Mr Lockhart said: 'He fires the weapon
towards the helicopter. We can say it was fired because you are able to
see a muzzle flash from the weapon.'

The jury heard that 12 shots were 
fired from at least four firearms. Mr Lockhart said the group was 
'organised' and 'came ready for the significant use of violence.'

He said that the group had acted with the express purpose of drawing police to the area so that they could be attacked.

He added: 'These defendants carried 
out a series of attacks that they knew would cause a large number of 
police officers to be deployed to deal with.

'It was their very aim to get a large 
number of police officers out on the street where they could then be 
attacked. It was, we say, their common purpose.

'We say that these defendants seized 
upon the opportunity presented by those unprecedented levels of pressure
being heaped upon the police to attack police officers trying to 
maintain law and order.

'When others were locking their doors and staying inside these men went out on to the streets armed and intent on violence.'

On Monday, six men and two youths went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court over the incident.

They are Tyrone Laidley, 20, Nicholas 
Francis, 26, and Joyah Campbell, 19, and two 17 year olds, who cannot be
named for legal reasons, all of Birmingham.

They were joined by Wayne Collins, 25,
of Luton, Bedfordshire, Renardo Farrell, of Wolverhampton, and Jermaine
Lewis, 27, of Oldbury, West Midlands.

They are each charged with riot, 
violent disorder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, 
and arson being reckless to whether life would be endangered.

The trial continues.
