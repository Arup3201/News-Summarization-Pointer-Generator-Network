Andy Murray lost the match but did enough to remind why he has won Grand Slams in the past and might yet do so again in the future.

At 1.17am, before the unruly remnants of the Flushing Meadows crowd, he finally succumbed to the barrage of Novak Djokovic in their US Open quarter final, going down 7-6 6-7 6-2, 6-4 in three hours and 31 minutes.

By the end Murray's spirit was willing but the legs had weakened, as he paid the price for taking three and a half hours longer to get to this match than his opponent.

This result was not unexpected, but for sustained periods he stood toe-to-toe with the world’s best player, whose standards he must aspire to if he is to re-attain the success of 2012-13.

Murray said afterwards: 'He was definitely physically fresher, the pace of my serve slowed down towards the end. My back towards the end stiffened up, it is physically extremely demanding to play him. I tried to hang in at the end but was a little bit disappointed how my body reacted, I have trained hard.

'There was some good stuff in the first two sets, I was down in them but I fought back, I just didn’t play a good first tiebreak.' 

Djokovic added: 'We both gave our best. At times the tennis was not that nice, we made a lot of unforced errors, but it was due to the very physical battle in the opening two and a half sets.

'I didn't expect any less knowing I was going to face Andy. The last five times we played, it was always over three or four hours. I'm very glad to get through to another semi-final.'

Neither player was flawless but there were plenty of magnificent exchanges which frequently pushed the Serb to his limits. Djokovic, who now plays Kei Nishikori, will surely win this event now.

There were ample unforced errors and both players went through sporadic lapses and, especially in Murray’s case, the return much outshone the serve. There was also much to admire. The Scot’s forehand was particularly potent, and he will contemplate what might have happened if he had avoided one of those lapses in the opening tiebreak.

Murray fought hard into the early hours. Ultimately, however, Djokovic with his seven breaks of serve bossed proceedings and from the second tiebreak never looked like losing. Murray at least knows he has created something to build on.

Two years after their epic final in 2012, the former junior rivals were reunited on the same court at the Arthur Ashes Stadium, this time with one of them ranked as the world’s top player and the other the No 8 seed. Murray's lower than normal seed being the reason why they were now meeting in the last eight.

That is not by accident, Murray is taking small steps on his way back from surgery while Djokovic has rediscovered the art of winning Grand Slams after a period of near misses.

On a balmy night, the Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed to the gunwales and the 27-year-old Scot made the perfect start when his piercing returns resulted in an opening break. He was always likely to make inroads on the Djokovic serve but protecting his own was going to be the problem.

He had dropped it thirteen times coming into this match and the fourteenth was not far behind as Djokovic immediately levelled. The inability to gain free points against someone who returns even better than he does saw him go 1-4 down - but the damage was swiftly repaired.

The Serb, ever the rolled up ball of Balkan anger, started ranting at himself in the seventh game and was pressured into several errors to allow Murray back in. The Scot’s big chance came when be forced a break point at 4-4, but a finely angled serve meant he could only just lay a racket on it.

By the time the tiebreak came around they had won 45 points each, but Murray could not recover from a dismal start - he hit a double fault followed by a pedestrian 77 mph second serve that got the full treatment.

The tiebreak was over in a blink of an eye, with the Serb taking it 7-1, and Djokovic looked to be in full control when a run of 12 out of 14 points saw him go 3-1 up, with Murray's net play notably more hesitant than in previous rounds.

But again Murray’s superb returns meant he was not finished and after breaking back for 4-4 - the top seed rightly being given a time violation - he forced a set point at 6-5. But he could not get enough on the return, was forced back and his attempted lob was put away.

The tiebreak was the inverse of the first, Murray far more purposeful and Djokovic ended up slapping errors in frustration by the end as he went down 7-1.

While there were frequent mistakes on both sides, Djokovic stayed strong to stem any momentum and broke for 3-1 in the third before holding off two break points when his opponent pulled the trigger too early in draining exchanges.

There was a devil-may-care attitude about Murray for the rest of the set as he focussed on energy conservation.

Murray began this tournament cramping against Robin Haase and ended it in a similar state, his body creaking at the end as he sought to hold in the fourth. He had a break point at the start but the body language sagged and he could not seriously threaten after that. The break of serve to seal it came entirely on cue.
