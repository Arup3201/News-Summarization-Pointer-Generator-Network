Former prime minister Gordon Brown 'will remain' an MP amid speculation that he could stand down as early as next year.

Since leaving No 10 Mr Brown has combined his job as a constituency MP with acting as the UN special envoy for global education.

Reports have suggested that he would stand down from the Commons at the general election in 2015.

But Mr Brown's office said the former Labour leader remained an MP and had 'no plans to make any announcement to the contrary'.

His spokesman said Mr Brown was playing an 'active role' campaigning for Scotland to vote No in September's independence referendum.

Responding to the claim he would leave the Commons next year, the spokesman said: 'So many people have tried to write this story on so many occasions with no facts.

'Mr Brown has just announced he is playing an active role in the referendum for United with Labour.

'He is giving a major speech next Tuesday and will be delivering a series of lectures on Scotland's future, the dates of which will be announced shortly.

'He is, and will remain, Member of Parliament for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath and he has no plans to make any announcement to the contrary.'

Last year Mr Brown described himself as an 'ex-politician'.

Taking part in a panel discussion at an education summit in Qatar, Mr Brown was asked his views 'as a politician', at which point he interjected "ex-politician".

He was reminded by the host - BBC presenter Mishal Husain - that he was still an MP, which he acknowledged.

Mr Brown has in the past faced criticism over the frequency of his speeches in the Commons since returning to the backbenches.

Since the 2010 general election, Mr Brown has appeared in the Commons to speak only nine times.
