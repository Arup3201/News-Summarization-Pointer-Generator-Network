Former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf narrowly escaped an assassination attempt after a bomb exploded near a convoy carrying the former ruler, police have said.

The bomb was planted along the general's route from the military hospital in Rawalpindi where he has been staying to his home in the capital Islamabad, a Pakistani police official has said.

There are conflicting reports as to whether the bomb exploded before or after the convoy carrying the former leader, who is on trial for treason, had passed the bridge.

Pakistani policemen inspect the site of a bomb explosion in Islamabad. Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who is on trial for treason, escaped the bomb blast in the early hours, police said

The bomb exploded as the general was being moved late Wednesday night from the military hospital in Rawalpindi where he has been staying to his home in the capital Islamabad

Musharraf's spokeswoman, Aasia Ishaq, said the retired general (pictured) was fine and reached his home safely but that it was up to the authorities to make sure nothing happens to him

Senior police official Liaqat Niazi told AFP four kilograms of explosives, planted in a pipeline under a bridge, exploded roughly 20 minutes before Musharraf was due to cross.

He said the former president was then taken home along a different route.

There have also been reports the convoy had just passed when the bomb went off.

Musharraf survived multiple assassination
 attempts while he was in office. When he returned to the country last 
year the Pakistani Taliban vowed to kill him.

The former president's spokesman Aasia Ishaq confirmed he reached his home safely following the incident late Wednesday night, the Associated Press reported.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

Ishaq said that it was up to the authorities to make sure nothing happens to him.

'All extremist and terrorist forces want to kill Musharraf,' said the spokeswoman. 'If anything happens to Musharraf, the government will be responsible.'

Musharraf, 70, took power in a 1999 coup and served until 2008, when he was forced to step down as his popularity plummeted.

He later went into self-imposed exile. Musharraf returned in March of last year to run in the elections - only to be disqualified and immediately face a number of legal challenges related to his time in office.

A special Pakistani court Monday indicted former military ruler Musharraf on five counts of high treason

The most serious is a high treason 
case brought against him by the government that could result in the 
death penalty if he's convicted.

The case stems from his decision to suspend the constitution on November 3, 2007, and detain a number of judges.

Musharraf
 was formally charged in the case on Monday. It was only his second 
appearance in the court proceedings which started in December.

He
 missed multiple appearances due to security concerns and others after 
going to the hospital in early January after complaining of chest pains.
