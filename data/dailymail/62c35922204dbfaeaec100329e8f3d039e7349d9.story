With their vibrant colours, pinpoint constellations and what could be brush strokes, these images are reminiscent of a great post-impressionist masterpiece.

One photograph shows a beautiful star stream over the South American night sky, which looks like a huge, celestial pinwheel.

Another contrasts the fire red mountains against the clear blue sky above.

Photographer Kevin Zaouali, 22, shot the ethereal landscapes at the Hornocal mountain range located in northern Argentina, near the Bolivian border.

The striking mountains are part of the  Quebrada de Humahuaca valley, a UNESCO world heritage site.

A rainbow of eleven different rock layers gives the peaks their distinctive appearance, and the best position for observation is a nearby hill which is located at an altitude of 4,300m. 

Besides the fantastic natural formation,  you can also see remains of human settlements which are estimated to be 10,000 years old.

Tracks, roads and settlements testify to the hunter-gathers, indigenous Omaguacas, Incas and Spanish civilisations that once lived here.

The Argentinian photographer said: 'The mountains are magical places.They are a range of wonderful colours and sometimes don't look real. I like to take advantage of the storms, sunrises and full moon nights. The light is very variable and each moment can be unique.'

Zaouali, from the Jujuy province of Argentina, takes photographs as a hobby while studying biology.
