With deep gashes on her forehead and dark bruising around her eyes, this is the horrific aftermath of a near-fatal domestic violence attack.

Hayley Lowles was left in a coma with a fractured skull, cheek and jaw and bleeding on the brain after her partner slammed an oven door on her head so hard the glass broke.

He also brutally assaulted the 34-year-old, breaking her nose and leaving part of her skull lodged in her brain.

Matthew Sargent, 30, has now been jailed for 16½ years after being convicted of attempted murder.

Hayley Lowes, a mother-of-one, was left in coma with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain after her partner savagely beat her and then slammed an oven door on her head.

And the mother-of-one has bravely decided to release photographs of her injuries to encourage other victims of abusive relationships to get help.

‘I feel if I could help just one person to have a good Christmas by escaping an abusive relationship then it feels like what I went through had a purpose,’ she said.

‘Whether they hit you or not, if you’re scared of them then it is not a normal relationship. I can’t believe it took him to nearly kill me for me to leave. You never realise how awful it is and how unhappy you are until you leave.’

The hairdresser was attacked at her home in Basildon, Essex, on August 22 last year when her partner of seven years snapped during an argument about his drinking.

She was left for dead after Sargent – who has been classed a danger to the public by psychologists – punched her at least ten times and hit her with the oven door.

He then grabbed their son William, aged seven months at the time, as he left the flat before going to an off-licence to buy more alcohol. The assault was so violent Miss Lowles remembers little about it – but she managed to crawl outside, where passers-by called for help.

Hayley's injuries left her unable to continue her career as they have affected her concentration

Doctors put her in an induced coma to help stabilise her condition. She has since had numerous operations to repair her skull and plastic surgery to her face, which was so swollen after the attack she was barely recognisable.

Although it was the first time Sargent turned violent, he had tormented Miss Lowles with years of psychological abuse.

‘I would never have classed what Matt did as domestic abuse. But now I’m aware it was so much worse than I ever realised,’ she said. Sargent’s behaviour always became worse around Christmas, she added, when he would disappear and spend the money they’d saved on a drink and drugs binge. ‘We never had one Christmas where he wasn’t arrested,’ she said.

‘He would always promise me lavish presents – but I just wanted a normal Christmas.’

Following his conviction at Basildon Crown Court in May, police described Sargent as a ‘violent and manipulative man’.

Miss Lowles has been unable to return to work since the attack because she now suffers problems with her concentration.

But she is rebuilding her life with her son – who is now 23 months old – and has agreed to be the face of an abuse awareness campaign run by Essex County Council and local police.

‘The attack did take a lot away from me. But I do still feel like I had a lucky escape – I could have died,’ she said.

The Essex police and crime commissioner Nick Alston added that society must collectively ‘support victims and raise awareness of this abhorrent crime’.
