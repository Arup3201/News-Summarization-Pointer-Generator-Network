There has been further humiliation for the weatherman whose story was dubbed the 'real-life Hangover' after he was drugged and swindled out of more than 
$40,000 by Eastern European bar girls which saw him fired from his job.

John Bolaris appeared in a Miami court last Friday to testify against the crime ring which had stolen $43,000 from him.

His moment of retribution however was tainted by one of the accused's testimony that during his wild weekend in 2010, he defecated in his pants.

Weathering the storm: John Bolaris has been further humiliated after being scammed out of $43,000 in Miami when one of the accused told the court that he defecated himself

Party time! Mr Bolaris, 54, spent $43,000 in a single weekend in Miami after falling victim to a Russian honeytrap scam

The 54-year-old denied the embarrassing incident when asked about it in court and later told Philly.com: 'No. 1, it didn't happen. If it did happen, I would say it happened.

He added: 'I am trying to have some dignity.'

Earlier this year, Mr Bolaris gave several interviews where he pieced together the weekend's hazy events.

The weatherman said he was having a drink at a
South Beach bar in Miami in March 2010 when he was approached by two 
women with Russian accents.

He explained: 'They come over and they
said, "Do you want to do a shot?" And I go, "No I don't want to do a 
shot".

'Then one comes behind me, rubs my shoulders, pulls back my head 
and says, "Come on, do a shot". And I said, "All right, I'll do a 
shot".'

Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs

Baited: As part of the scam, women were flown in from Russia and the Baltic States to manipulate men at private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia

After having a few drinks with the 
women they took him in a taxi to their friend's art shop. He said after 
that the details are very sketchy.

'I remember standing up ... signing something, vaguely. Next thing I know, I'm in a cab with a big painting [of a woman's head].

'Then I woke up, I had red wine on my shirt, fully clothes and I'm thinking - something happened, but what?'

Surprisingly, one of the 'B-girls' 
called him to say she had his sunglasses and they agreed to meet up 
later so he could return the piece of art. He
said he got in a taxi with them and 'next thing I know I'm passed out'.

He woke up the next morning feeling sick and very worried before receiving a
call from American Express to tell him $43,712.25 had been charged to 
his card - including $2,480 for the painting.

American
Express wouldn't let him dispute the charges because a man called Stan 
Pavlenko - who was later arrested in the case - supplied them with a 
photo of the weather man at the bar showing he was using his own card.

Mr Bolaris won a court case in June with American Express to get his money back plus damages.

After he gave interviews about his experience to 20/20 and Playboy, his employer, Philadelphia Fox 29 affiliated WTXF where he had worked for four years, fired him.

The company issued a statement saying they 'mutually agreed that it was time to part ways'.

Mr Bolaris, who recently got engaged to former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman, said: 'On face value, it looks like a ''Hangover''-type movie. It's easy to sit outside and make fun of it.'

He added that if it wasn't for the fact he approached the FBI, the gang would not have been caught.

On the run: Alec Simchuk fled to Eastern Europe after the FBI investigation but was arrested this week

After contacting the FBI, they launched a criminal investigation of the Eastern European criminal activities in the South Beach clubs, using an undercover cop to get information.

Alec Simchuk, who was arrested in July, ran some of the Miami clubs where girls would get patrons drunk - while they were throwing out their own drinks - and charge them exorbitant amounts for drinks, enforcing Florida's 'innkeeper law' to force customers to pay.

The law requires patrons disputing a charge to challenge the bill with their own credit card company rather than the vendor. Patrons who refuse to sign their bill risk getting arrested.

After spending more than a year and an estimated $1million investigating the case, 16 suspects - including almost a dozen b-girls and a handful of male managers and accountants - were arrested after a fake birthday party was thrown by the undercover officer.

The case is ongoing.
