A Good Samaritan was left seriously injured and unable to work after being viciously attacked by two teenage thugs who he’d reprimanded for swearing at an elderly couple.

Nigel Helmn, of Whitley Bay, was punched in the back of the head with such force that he fell on the floor and damaged a knee ligament.

Mr Helmn has been unable to stand properly for the past five months and needs to undergo surgery.

Injured: Nigel Helmn has been unable to walk for the past five months after being attacked by two teenagers

Now, as his teenage attackers walk free from court, Mr Helmn told how the incident has affected his life.

The 61-year-old said: 'It’s been a nightmare. I can’t work which means it’s hard to pay the rent. I can’t stand up for very long which means I haven’t been able to leave the house very much.

'Now, I’m having to have surgery on my knee which means another six to eight weeks out of action.'

Mr Helmn, a supermarket security guard, had been out for a drink in Fitzgeralds in Whitley Bay on February 19 this year.

He said: 'I’d popped out and into Sainsbury’s and came out and there were these two young lads who had run over to an old couple and were shouting every sexual thing you could think of.

'I went over to them and told them I’d have them arrested if they didn’t stop it.

'They then ran about 20 yards and started shouting at these girls in North Parade.'

Mr Helmn said he went to get a radio from a security guard at a nearby pub when he suddenly felt a fist to the back of his head.

He said: 'I just went down, hitting the door and landing on my right knee, tearing a ligament.'

Shocked staff called an ambulance and Mr Helmn was taken to North Tyneside General Hospital where he needed seven stitches to the back of his head and treatment to his knee.

Mr Helmn said: 'The knee swelled up, it was massive. Since then I’ve been unable to work. I can pay the rent this month but after that I’m going to struggle.'

Tyler Latimer and David Polglase, both 18, have been spared immediate custody because of their age after admitting unlawful wounding.

Mr Helmn said: 'It doesn’t seem that much considering what’s happened, does it?'

Addressing the pair at Newcastle Crown Court, Recorder Michael Slater told them: 'Between the pair of you, you punched him to the ground and each of you kicked him.

'As a result of that he sustained injuries to his head and knee and was left, to a certain extent, in a state of disability for a period of time.

'Whatever your argument was with him, he certainly did not deserve that at your hands.

'Were you some years older you would be going straight to custody today.

You are only saved by your age and what the author of the pre-sentence report puts before the court.'

Latimer, of Whitley Bay, and Polglase, of Newcastle, both pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding.

Latimer was given 12 months custody suspended for two years with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work.

Polglase got nine months suspended for two years with supervision and 150 hours unpaid work.

Katherine Dunn, for Latimer, said: 'He wants to write a letter to the victim to explain how sorry he is and also to show the victim how he had changed his life around almost as a result of this offence.'

Tony Hawks, for Polglase, said: 'This was a disgraceful offence on any view but he has exhibited genuine remorse and insight for his behaviour.

'The victim chose to confront them, it’s not just two lads repeatedly kicking an elderly man in the street.'
