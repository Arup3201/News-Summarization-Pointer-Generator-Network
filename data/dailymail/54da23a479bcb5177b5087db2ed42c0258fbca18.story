Germany's World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low expects Borussia Dortmund to turn around their disastrous season - citing their struggles this campaign as a mere one-off scenario.

Despite boasting the talents of Mats Hummels, Marco Reus and Ciro Immobile the German giants find themselves struggling in the top tier with 14 points from as many games.

Dortmund's alarming form is in stark contrast to the side's results over the last four years which saw them crowned Bundesliga champions in successive seasons in 2011 and 2012. In addition they have finished as runners-up to Bayern Munich in the following two - as well as losing the Champions League final to their bitter rivals at Wembley in 2013.

Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp has come under pressure after the club's woeful start to the season

Jurgen Klopp's side have lost eight of their 14 domestic clashes so far this season but Low, who guided the national team to glory in Brazil this summer, believes it's only a matter of time before BVB return to winning ways - although he concedes that qualifying for European football next season looks highly unlikely.

'I regard the situation at Dortmund as a one-off,' the Germany boss told Sport Bild. 'They are still athletically and economically well positioned.

'After years of success, though, they are now just dealing with a difficult period that they have to overcome.

'Maybe they won't be in European competition for a year but they will regroup. I believe that Borussia will be a good rival for Bayern again in the coming years.'  

Dortmund have lost eight of their 14 league games this season, including a 2-0 defeat at Frankfurt on Sunday
