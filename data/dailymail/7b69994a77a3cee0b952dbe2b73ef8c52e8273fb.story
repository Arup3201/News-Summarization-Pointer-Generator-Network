We all like to be pampered on holiday - and many hotel spas are pushing the boat out when it comes to providing the most cutting-edge beauty treatments.

But would you take a noodle hot tub, or cover your face in sterilised nightingale excretion in the name of well-being?

Guests can now return from their spa retreats having being scrubbed down by a cactus, lathered in marmalade, and having had their backs rolled on by golf balls.

Using nightingale poo in a facial is an ancient Japanese beauty treatment that has recently started to be used in the west

The bird poo Geisha face mask 

Known as the Geisha Face Mask, this beauty treatment involves using sterilised nightingale excretion which is supposed to draw bacteria out from your skin, and break down dead skin cells. 

Victoria Beckham is said to be a fan of the treatment, which has been used by Japanese geishas for centuries. 

If you're brave enough, you can experience this at the Ten Thousand Waves Spa in Santa Fe.   

Skin should feel exfoliated and brightened -  and so it should, the treatment does not come cheap.

$115 (£77) for 55 mins - Ten Thousand Waves Spa, Santa Fe
