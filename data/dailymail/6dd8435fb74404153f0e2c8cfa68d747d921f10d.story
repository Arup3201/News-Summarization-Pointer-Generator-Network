 

Devoted mother:  Myra Goldman , 68, seen here wearing sunglasses was on her way to her office when the massive gate suddenly came loose and toppled onto her

A petite mother was crushed to death by a giant metal gate at a business park after it toppled on top of her as she was unlocking it to go to work, an inquest heard.

Myra Goldman, 68, was on her way to her office when the massive 8ft long and 6ft high gate suddenly came loose and pinned her tiny frame to the ground.

The businesswoman who stood just 4ft 11in tall was crushed by the weight of the palisade gate, which was thought to have been damaged six months earlier, and died at the scene.

The hearing was told the mother of three from Whitefield, Manchester had carried on working as a florist despite being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2011. 

In spite of her prognosis and suffering from a painful hip, Myra carried on her business arranging floral decorations for special occasions, turning up every day without fail to take telephone orders.

Her husband, Cyril Goldman, 80, told the two day inquest: 'She was the type of person who couldn't find wrong in anybody. She wouldn't give up. She worked every day, no matter how busy it was.She never complained.'

Mrs Goldman had arrived at the business park to complete an order for a customer in the Middle East at 10,30am on Sunday 3rd March 2013.

She was crushed after she got out of her Citroen Picasso to manually open the 6ft high by 8ft wide entrance gate.

Passer-by Daniel Massey who happened on the scene after visiting a barbers shop told the Oldham inquest: 'I saw a large metal gate on the floor and what appeared to be an object underneath.

'As I approached the metal gate I could see a person underneath. I immediately thought the person was beyond help. I rang 999 and spoke to the operator.

'I returned to the car and waited for the paramedics and police to arrive.

The gate was 8ft long and 6ft high and made of metal. I would not have been able to move it.'

Mrs Goldman set up her business in 1998 before moving to the Whitefield Business Centre where she shared a storage unit housing her flower company, Si Si Flowers, with a balloon company.

She was described by her family as a 'devoted mother with strength and dignity.'

Her husband of 40 years, a retired shop keeper, said he had encountered trouble when he previously opened the high security gate, which featured iron railings, himself when he went to the office with his wife.

Mr Goldman said: 'Everyday I opened the locking bar, slid the lock off and pushed the right hand gate to the wall and held it there. If you did not and turned your back it would come back at you. It had a habit of swinging back and closing itself.

'I found no resistance from the gate but as a small petite woman it was heavy and hard to push forward. The locking bar had previously been damaged and never been replaced. This happened at least six months prior but I am not sure.'

Talking of his wife's illness Mr Goldman added: 'She was unable to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The reason for that was that her lungs had deteriorated to such a degree that that form of treatment would not work. But she never complained. She wasn't the type of person to moan. I think she was lying about the pain.

Scene of tragedy: Entrance to the Whitefield Business Centre in Manchester where florist, Mrs Goldman, was pinned down by the weight of the palisade gate

No longer standing: This is where the iron gate that crashed down on Mrs Goldman once stood, it has since been replaced

'Although she was always tired, she did all the house work. She cooked, cleaned, did the washing and ironing She was the type of person that could not find wrong in anybody. Everybody liked her. She didn't' have any enemies.'

Mrs Goldman had also ran a 5k Race for Life in a aid of Cancer Research and enjoyed visiting her son in Spain, where he worked as a flight instructor.

A post mortem examination concluded that the cause of her death was 'traumatic asphyxia'.

Home office pathologist Dr Naomi Carter said it was likely Mrs Goldman died within minutes of the fatal crush wounds.

Former site manager, Daniel Reilly, who was employed by owners of the site, Spaces & Place Ltd said: 'When I went to the site the gates were open most of the time. The gates are closed at night time and the last person living ensures the gate is locked.

'I had previously opened the gate on occasion and experienced no problems. The gate has only had one previous problem to the best of my knowledge. This was in the winter when the gate was scraping along the floor and the issue was raised with my boss and it was repaired. They also replaced the fencing next to the gate and also fitted palisade fencing.'

The inquest heard a new gate with more hinges which were larger had been fitted since Mrs Goldman's death. 

The owner of Spaces & Places Ltd, Timothy Churchill, who lives in Alderley Edge, and who has 21 brick units and storage containers in the business centre said: 'I would like to express my utmost sorrow over the occurrence of this tragic incident.'

The inquest continues.
