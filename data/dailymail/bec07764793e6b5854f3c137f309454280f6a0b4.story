Bisexual women are more likely to suffer mental health problems than lesbians, new research claims.   

The largest British survey of its kind found bisexual women are more likely to feel depressed, self-harm, and develop eating issues.

Bisexual women were 64 per cent more likely to report an eating problem and 37 per cent more likely to have deliberately self-harmed than lesbians, according to the research published in the Journal of Public Health.

They were also 26 per cent more likely to have felt depressed, and 20 per cent more likely to have suffered from anxiety in the previous year than lesbians.

Using data from the 2007 Stonewall UK Women's Health Survey, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine analysed responses from 5,700 bisexual and lesbian women living in the UK aged 14 or over.

The study found bisexual women were less likely to be 'out' to friends, family and work colleagues and also less likely to be in a relationship.

While they were less likely to experience sexuality-related discrimination from work, healthcare services, education and family than lesbians, they were more likely to suffer problems with friends.

The new findings differ from those of a similar UK survey in 2003, which found no difference in psychological distress between bisexual women and lesbians.

Study lead author Lisa Colledge added: 'These disturbing results echo international findings on mental health differences between bisexual and homosexual people.

'Although non-hetrosexual women as a group have far poorer mental health than heterosexual women, bisexual women report even worse mental distress than lesbians.'

Study senior author Dr Ford Hickson, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'Bisexual people are at particular risk of invisibility and marginalisation from both gay and lesbian communities and mainstream society.

'Although bisexual women in our study reported experiencing less sexuality-based discrimination than lesbians, this did not benefit their mental health.

'Mental health services should be aware of both the differences and the similarities in bisexual and lesbian women's mental health care needs, and tailor the services they provide accordingly.'

The researchers also found that older bisexual women had more suicidal thoughts than younger bisexual women.

They were also more likely to report poor physical health and more likely to use marijuana or tranquilisers than lesbians.

Ms Colledge added: 'All women deserve equal chances of mental well-being and happiness, regardless of their sexuality.

'Homophobic prejudice is now widely and rightly condemned; specific stigma around bisexual identity needs to be similarly confronted.'

In the UK, where the study was conducted, the numbers of women identifying as lesbian and as bisexual are similar.

However, only 16 per cent of the survey participants were bisexual women. The researchers suggested this may be linked to bisexual women's reluctance to disclose their sexual identity.

The researchers said that 'concealment of sexual orientation is known to be related to poorer mental health in sexual minority women'.

The study authors suggest that bisexual women may have a more negative attitude towards themselves, and expect more social rejection, putting their mental health at risk.

The authors suggest that legal and social changes in subsequent years, such as the 2004 Civil Partnership Act, and improvements in public attitudes towards lesbian and gay people, may have benefited lesbian women more than bisexual women.
