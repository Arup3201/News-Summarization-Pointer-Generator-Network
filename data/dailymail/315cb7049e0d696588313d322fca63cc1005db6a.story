Seek and destroy: The lethal Predator drone is 27ft long and comes armed with Hellfire missiles

Drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes: they can track drug smugglers, monitor borders and search for earthquake victims, and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers. 

But hundreds of drones have crashed in the last 14 years with documents uncovered by the Washington Post that show many catastrophes have been narrowly averted, often by a few feet, or a few seconds, or pure luck.

Military drones have slammed into homes, farms, runways, highways, waterways and, in one of the most serious accidents an Air Force C-130 Hercules transport plane collide with a drone in midair.

The driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military, who use them for spying and killing.

Their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths, the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability.

In August 2011, the enormous transport place was descending towards Forward Operating Base Sharana, in eastern Afghanistan when suddenly it crashed into the drone.

'Holy s**t!' yelled the Hercules’s navigator, 'We got hit by a UAV! Hit by a UAV!'

The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was being flown remotely by a crew on the ground and smashed into the cargo plane’s left wing between two propellers.

Jet fuel came pouring out of the wing.

Luckily the crew of the Hercules were able to shut down an engine and landed within two minutes of the accident happening.

Downed drone: The wreckage of a Predator drone that crashed into Kandahar air base in May 2011

Flying blind: Air Force Maj. Richard Wageman operates a Predator from a ground-control station in Afghanistan on Oct. 25, 2008. A week later, he was the pilot of a Predator that crashed into a U.S. military base. The precise cause of the crash was undetermined

The impact left an enormous hole in planes' wing. About 50 seconds later, the drone operator came across the radio to inform the control tower he had lost track of his aircraft.

The tower was able to set him straight. 'We had a, ah, C-130, um, that hit a UAV. I’m suspecting that it’s yours.'

The official finding of what caused the crash was censored. Some of the documents obtained by the Washington Post indicate the air-traffic controller was at least partly blamed.

Military officials said there has been only one other case of a midair drone collision, involving a helicopter and a small, hand-launched drone in Iraq a decade ago but there have been more plenty of other incidents on the ground.

In one accident in Afghanistan, armed Predator drones crashed near residential areas in the city of Jalalabad twice in the space of six months.

The first time, the drone smashed into a housing complex. The second was into a row of shipping containers.

The military paid compensation to those who were affected.

On another occasion, a drone was slammed into a 17,000 foot mountain because the 'pilot' was distracted by storm clouds.

Maintenance of the drones has also been a cause of some accidents. A broken propeller downed one of the machines.

In other instances a drone was flown by an inexperienced officer who forgot to turn the stabilizer on (or perhaps unforgivably, turned it off!)

The unmanned aircraft took a nose dive soon after takeoff - and it was all caught on camera.

Part of the reasons for so many accidents was the design of the Predator drone. It had only one engine, one alternator, one propeller. If any of those parts failed, the plane would come down.

Collision: In one of the more shocking incidents, a drone flew into the wing of a C-130 Hercules military transport plane. The plane was just minutes from touching down,m but it could have resulted in a very serious accident

In September 2004 armed insurgents are holding parts of a US Army remote controlled drone. The US military cited mechanical failure as the most likely cause of the crash

Technology: The Predator's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air

On six occasions between 2006 and 
2012, records show, pilots intentionally flew straight into the side of a
 mountain after their aircraft’s engines began to fail.

The
 thinking was it would be safer to fly into the ground in a remote area 
than risk some kind of attempt at landing where the drone could fall on 
someone. 

They're prone
 to bad weather such as high wind, lightening and icing. A drone fell 
into the sea after chunk of ice fell off the tail.

Following the 9/11 attacks on New 
York in 2001, the US military filled its shopping trolleys with every  
type of drone on the production line and commissioned new ones.

In 2000, the Pentagon had fewer than 50 
drones. A decade later, that number had soared to nearly 7,500. Most 
were used for surveillance, but the number of weapons strikes kept 
increasing, from 74 in 2007 to 839 by 2012.

They bought the 38in-long Raven which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air.

They invested in the 27ft-long Predator with its Hellfire missiles, and later the more powerful Reaper version.

Powerful: The Reaper model can ling in the air for about 18 hours but others have an endurance of weeks

The
 Predator’s infrared camera can identify the heat of a human from 
10,000ft in the air, so from 8,000 miles away in Nevada a drone ‘pilot’ 
or operator can watch an Afghan as he lights a cigarette or talks to 
friends.

Then the US bought the 40ft-long Global Hawk with its long-range surveillance capability of 40,000 square miles a day.

Drones
 can fly low and slow over hostile terrain, and hover for hours, or all 
day if need be. The Reaper can linger in the air for about 18 hours. 
Others have an endurance of weeks.

Then there is the Vulture. Solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years.

Boeing has already produced a prototype for its Phantom Ray drone, roughly the size of a fighter jet, which flies itself.

Since the drone program began, the Air Force has acquired 269 Predators.

The
 company that makes the drones says a redesign with two engines is 
simply not possible because of the enormous amount of design work it 
would entail.

The Air Force
 has acknowledged that Predators crash more frequently than regular 
military aircraft, but officials said the drone’s safety record has 
improved markedly.

Sometimes,
 the planes simply disappear. Few carry transponders that work when the 
electrical power has failed because of the extra weight.

Because
 the drones are piloted wirelessly, their signals are also prone to 
interruption. Sometimes the outage can last a few minutes.

Unreliable? Drones have malfunctioned in multiple ways, plummeting from the sky because of mechanical breakdowns, human error, bad weather

The
 planes are supposed to return to base automatically or fly around in 
circles until communication is restored. But sometimes, the drones are 
simply lost - and the screens back at base go blank, a worry thought as 
armed drones fly in the skies above the US, UK, Israel, Iran and China.

Some 76 
countries all told have drones, with many in the process of weaponizing 
them.

Iran is supplying 
drones to Hezbollah in Lebanon; South Africa is selling lethal drones  
to Saudi Arabia; Israel is  selling drones all over Africa  and Latin 
America.

The global drones arms race, spurred on by the US, is in full cry.
