The smile on 11-year-old Tanjin's face as he plays football on the tiny island of Lampedusa hides the life-threatening journey he took to get there.

He is one of 2,000 asylum seekers to land on Italy's southern port since last weekend - having risked their lives crossing the rough Mediterranean waters on smuggling boats.

The Eritrean boy left his family behind and if he is sent back too, he faces being conscripted into the country's military.

For that reason, the boy is likely to remain in Europe where he will continue his education.

Escaped: 11-year-old Tanjin left his family behind in Eritrea and he faces military conscription if he is sent back

Refugees: Tenjin (right) is one of 2,000 asylum seekers to land on Italy's southern port since last weekend

New life: Many of the migrants who landed in Lampadusa this week risked their lives crossing the rough Mediterranean waters on rickety smuggling boats

Alone: Youngsters like Tenjin will be transferred to a reception centre on the mainland that specialises in dealing with minors who reach the country unaccompanied

Hope: Despite the harsh surroundings they find themselves in, many migrants seem happy to have escaped the horrors and conflicts of their home countries

He will now be transferred to a reception centre on the mainland that specialises in dealing with minors who reach the country alone.

Several children did not survive the trip. As many as 300 migrants are thought to have drowned on the rough Mediterranean waters after being ordered to get on flimsy rubber dinghies from Libya.

While Tanjin worked on his dribbling, Somali teenager Abdenajib was calling worried relatives back home.

'I am saying that I'm in Italy now, it's good. They see, I am saying that I haven't died,' he said after the conversation with his mother and sister who occupy a refugee camp in Kenya.

Abdenajib acknowledges how lucky he was to survive a day and a half at sea - just days after 29 migrants had perished from exposure.

And speaking through the chain-link fence at Lampedusa's migrant reception centre, the 15-year-old revealed his dream was to become a doctor.

He said: 'I want help, I want to learn and education. I want to go to Norway.' 

Exodus: More than 170,000 migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and South Asia landed in Italy last year

Survivor: As many as 300 migrants drowned crossing the Mediterranean on flimsy rubber dinghies in Libya

Suriviors: These girls who wait anxiously for a ferry to Sicily are lucky, having survived the dangerous Mediterranean waters

Fleeing terror: Some of the migrants in Lampedusa were forced to flee the violent spread of militancy in Libya 

Breaking point: Lampedusa struggled to cope with a huge influx of newly-arrived migrants as aid organisations warned the Libya crisis means thousands more could be on their way

His journey began in Kenya, from where he travelled through Uganda and Sudan before finally reaching the Libyan capital Tripoli. There, he handed over £700 to smugglers for the boat trip to Italy.

Most of the migrants on Lampedusa - including Adam from Mali - were rescued by the Italian coastguard or by merchant ships.

He said: 'We were in the first boat and that's why we didn't have problems because Italians took us in when the waves started coming towards us.

'As for me, I need Italian citizenship. Here, we are all tired. Since I left the north of Mali until now, there have been issues.' 

Mass emigration: More than 5,000 migrants - including those fleeing the Libya crisis - have arrived in Italy since the start of January alone which is a 59 per cent increase on the same time last year

Death at sea: More than 300 African migrants are believed to have died at sea this week alone, some of which are trying to escape the spread of militancy in Libya

Danger: Most of the migrants on Lampedusa were rescued by the Italian coastguard or by merchant ships

The sudden surge in arrivals has stretched the island's reception facilities to breaking point as the centre struggles to deal with three times the number of migrants it was designed to. 

More than 170,000 migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and South Asia landed in Italy last year and the trend since the start of the year suggests that number will be surpassed in 2015.

Amnesty International said the European Union's limited coastal patrol operation off Italy was desperately ill-equipped to cope with the soaring numbers.

Its spokesperson said: 'Unless the void of Italy's now defunct lifesaving Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation is filled, refugees and migrants will continue to die in great numbers at sea.'
