Some Python Challenge 2013 contestants have taken things literally as 21 snakes have now been bagged, with some being turned into actual bags.

And belts and shoes and even pants.

The first of its kind competition to see what brave hunter can wrangle the most Burmese pythons kicked off January 12 and some fashion forward Floridians will benefit along with the winner of the challenge.

Slithering slacks: One possible fate for the snakes caught during Python Challenge 2013 is to become a pair of $1800 snakeskin pants

Brian Wood is a co-owner of Exotic Leather Fashions in Hollywood, Florida and he said the Python Challenge is the perfect opportunity to repurpose his company's expertise in harvesting, tanning and sewing alligator skins for handbags and other fine leather goods.

'The snakes have become a problem because they're invasive,' WoodÂ told WPLG. 'It just seemed natural for us to go ahead and start buying the snakes from the hunters and utilizing them in our fashions.'

Here's how it works: once hunters kill a python, usually with a gunshot to the brain, they turn the specimen over to officials at designated check stations where researchers gather biological information in the hopes of learning how to better combat the quickly reproducing nuisance species.

Interested hunters may then retrieve their snake and take it on over to Exotic Leather Goods where Brian Wood is paying premium prices for pythons. Up to $150 each, though that's only for the best specimens.

From there, the pythons are skinned and some are dyed while others are left with their natural brownish colors and then the skins are turned into high fashion.

For instance, they might be made into snakeskin pants.

And if the idea of pants made out of serpent doesn't make you wince, the price tag might: these scaly slacks go for upwards of $1800 per pair.

In addition to adding flair to the local look, Python Challenge 2013 exists to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem.

While it's unknown how many pythons live in the Everglades, roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000.

Eleven snakes were caught in the first three days of the contest.

Researchers say the large snakes menace 
native wildlife and believe native creatures like raccoons and opossum 
are fewer in number in areas the python is thought to live.

Florida law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets and they may only be legally transported if dead.

Hunters
 are restricted to four state wildlife management areas; Everglades 
National Park is off-limits. They may use some firearms, as well as 
captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons. Native species may not be 
taken.

The state is offering cash prizes to 
whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons 
by the time the competition ends at midnight Feb. 10.
