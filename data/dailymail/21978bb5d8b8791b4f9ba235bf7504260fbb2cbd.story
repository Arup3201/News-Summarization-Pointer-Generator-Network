An American fugitive convicted for attempted murder has been found living in Kent after nine years on the run.

It has emerged that Sean Lopes, 47,  has a partner, two children and a dog in the UK and even worked at Sainsbury's.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in his absence for confronting his 22-year-old ex-girlfriend with a gun and a knife and holding her hostage in New York City in June 2004.

Last
 year U.S. authorities said they believed Lopes, a man named as one of 
NYPD's most wanted in 2006, was hiding in Trinidad and Tobago.

Job: Lopes worked at Pepper Hill  Sainsbury's in Northfleet as a manager, insiders say

The Guyanese-born former science teacher was arrested but fled the country when released on bail.

Kent police said yesterday that Lopes had been living in central Chatham, about 33 miles southeast of London.

Gina Jones, 29, lived next door to Sean Lopes with her 8-year-old son.

Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Jones described Lopes as a ‘weird’ man who was rarely seen out on the street

‘I've only seen a guy in the garden twice and heard a man in there. He was weird, he never put the bins out or came out the front of the house.

'I reckon he used to go in and out the back way because you can get to the houses from a path at the back. No-one seems to know him so it makes sense now. It was as if they kept themselves to themselves.

'It's scary to think he lives next door to my kid.’

Another neighbour who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘He didn't seem suspicious, but I've only seen him walking up and down the road.

'There's so much going on in this country and not enough punishment.’

Home: The fugitive lived in this house (centre) in Chatham, Kent, and neighbours described him as a nice man

Lopes first moved to the UK in 2010 
and lived in a flat in Basildon, Essex, for about nine months before 
moving to the Medway towns in Kent.

One woman neighbour said he was a 'smashing chap' and has two little boys that are roughly five years old.

'I met Sean for the first time a couple of days ago. I took a parcel for him,' she said.

'When he came back in his car, I called him over and asked him what his name was.

'He said "I'm Sean Lopes". He shook my hand and introduced himself and told me his wife's name.

'He said he was a manager at Sainsbury's.

'He was awfully nice. He was very polite. He was a smashing chap.

'I
 just cannot believe who he really is. I was devastated to find out - a 
bit shocking to find out you live near a man convicted of attempted 
murder.'

Another neighbour, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I met the woman who lives there for the first time on Tuesday. She was having a sale in her house.

'She was there with two young boys. She said they were moving back to America where they came from'.

Hideout: Kent police said Lopes had been living in the town of Chatham

Another former neighbour said: 'He said he 
was Canadian. They just seemed like a normal family – dad, mum, kids and
 a dog. Then, virtually overnight, they just left.'

A Sainsbury’s spokeswoman confirmed 
that Lopes worked at their Pepper Hill store in Northfleet, Kent, but 
would not say what position he held.

A female staff member at the store, 
who would not be named, said: 'He wasn't popular at all - in fact, I 
don't know anyone here who liked him. There was something really freaky 
about him.

'He was in charge of the night shift when the store was closed and the work involved restocking the shelves and cleaning it.

'He was always moaning at people and didn't like anyone having a laugh at work.

'If someone messed around he would get nasty with them and pick on them.

'But I was shocked when I heard the news he had been arrested because he tried to murder his ex-girlfriend in America.

'It makes my skin crawl to think I worked with him - I dread to think what he could have done.'

Officers arrested him Monday after consulting detectives in New York 
and he appeared before Westminster magistrates court yesterday.

Last year U.S. authorities said they believed Lopes, a man named as one of NYPD's most wanted in 2006, was hiding in Trinidad and Tobago

Yesterday a spokesman for Kent Police confirmed Lopes had been arrested after a member of the public raised concerns about him.

In
 2004 the married father-of-one attacked his former girlfriend Amanda 
Hopkins, a 22-year-old teacher from Bronx, in her home and held her 
hostage at gunpoint.

According
 to police, Lopes was furious that Miss Hopkins had dumped him after 
discovering he was not only married and a father, but also ten years 
older than he had claimed.

He
 broke into Miss Hopkins home armed with a stun gun, a serrated knife, 
black gloves and a black ski mask as well as a BB gun altered to look 
like a 9-mm handgun.

When she arrived home from work, Lopes allegedly tackled her, tried to strangle her and threatened her with a gun.

Holding the serrated knife to her throat, he threatened Miss Hopkins, saying he was going to kill her and then commit suicide

Neighbours who heard Miss Hopkins’ screams called the police and the NYPD hostage team stormed the flat.

Lopes was found still holding the knife to Miss Hopkins’ throat, yet 
upon his arrest claimed she was the one holding him hostage.

His wife put up their family home to cover the $250,000 bail, but he fled shortly afterwards.

Extradition proceedings are in motion as of yesterday's court appearance and Lopes will remain in British custody until May 14.
