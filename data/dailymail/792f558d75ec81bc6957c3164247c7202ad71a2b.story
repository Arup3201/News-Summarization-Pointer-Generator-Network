The founder of a sexually transmitted disease information app called Hula said he doesn't plan to change the name despite an online petition asking him to do so. But he said he now understands why the tagline 'getting lei'd' is culturally insensitive.

Hula CEO and founder Ramin Bastani told The Associated Press on Wednesday that his Los Angeles-based company is working hard to understand concerns raised by some in the Native Hawaiian community.

An online petition, which had more than 700 signatures on Change.org, says the name exploits a beloved cultural art form.

Backlash: Ramin Bastani, the founder of STD information app Hula, has been forced to apologize after a petition was launched by native Hawaiians claiming the name is culturally insensitive

Mr Bastani said he immediately removed any references to 'getting lei'd' when concerns were brought to his attention by a Native Hawaiian health expert last month.

'We didn't realize that it was offensive,' he said. 'We removed any connection to it.'

But the name Hula will remain, he said: 'We want to do the right thing. Changing the name, for us, doesn't make sense.'

The petition was started by three college students who went to high school at Kamehameha Schools, which gives admission preference to students with Native Hawaiian ancestry, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

The petition notes that the arrival of Europeans exposed Native Hawaiians to foreign diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis.

'My culture is more than a tourist destination,' Kelly Luis, a student at Columbia University, told the newspaper.

'We didn't realize the term "getting lei'd" was offensive. We removed any connection to it'

'It is more than a place to go for the summer. It's more than just sexy hula girls on the beach. There is a culture there.'

The app was originally named Qpid.me, 
but it sounded too similar to a dating site and was changed to Hula 
because the company wanted to evoke a 'sense of beauty and being 
relaxed,' Mr Bastani said. 'It was a pop culture sense of the name.'

'We loved the idea of calm and beauty 
of anything Hawaiian,' he said, 'which is the antithesis of anything 
having to do with health care.'

Cultural mainstay: 'Hula was and still is a sacred art form of the Hawaiian people,' reads the petition. 'It recounts the history of our people'

Response: Mr Bastani removed references to 'getting lei'd' after learning it was offensive, but the name Hula will remain, he said: 'We want to do the right thing. Changing the name, for us, doesn't make sense'

Learning about Hawaiian culture has taught him that dancing hula is a 'communication tool' used to pass on information among generations. 'That plays very well with what we actually believe as the core of the company,' he said.

Mr Bastani said he apologizes to anyone who has been offended and that he never meant any harm.

He also noted that there have been some Native Hawaiians and others in Hawaii who are supportive of the name.

In the past, he has worn a lei when making presentations about the company, he said. 'Now that we know that's an insensitive way of doing it, it's not something we'll do anymore,' he stated.

Hula, which was launched last month, promises to make the dating world 'less awkward' with a profile feature that displays which STDs you've been tested for

It not only helps you find local test centers, but it also has healthcare providers send your results directly to the app, where you can share them with others on the social network.

Of course, if you'd rather keep that information private, you can opt out of sharing results publicly on your profile.

Hula also lets users review STD clinics and sends out reminders about getting tested regularly.

And Hula users can rest assured that 
the STD results posted on profiles are always accurate, since they come 
directly from a doctor, noting exactly when the user was tested.

Hula founder and CEO Ramin Bastani told the Huffington Post that he hopes it can reduce the risk of spreading of STDs by having sex with people who meet on location-based dating apps.

'In the not too distant future you'll be able to see a badge on someone's dating profile showing they've verified STD status by Hula,' explained Mr Bastani, who is currently collaborating with MISTER - a dating app for gay men - to encourage users to get tested and share their results.

'That can help you make better decisions about how you want to connect,' he added.
