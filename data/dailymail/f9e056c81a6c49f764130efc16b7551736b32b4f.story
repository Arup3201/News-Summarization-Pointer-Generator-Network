Welcome to the old person's home for dogs - who are all waited on hand and paw.

Oaklies Oldies, the Dogs Trust's rehoming centre in Shrewsbury, West Midlands, is a sanctuary for abandoned mature dogs.

Eight years ago, the house was converted into the perfect respite for the 'OADs' with boxes of toys, cushy couches and a large garden to play in.

But the noise of the washing machine and volunteers putting the kettle on provide a welcome comfort to the pets used to the sounds of a normal home.

The centre can house as many as a dozen dogs at a time and caters especially for pooches over the age of seven who have been left behind by their owners.

Some of the older dogs entrusted to the Dog's Trust cannot cope with the kennels after a lifetime in a family setting.

These pets are treated to a stay in the snug shelter as they wait as long as six weeks to be adopted.

Each room is furnished perfectly for the pets, with donated cushions, dog beds, and a personal patio to roam outside.

One musical puppy even had a piano in its room for him play by running on.

The dogs have been turned out of homes as their owners get older or the pets become too troublesome to look after.

Some of the residents have a long list of ailments and medication they require.

Lee Pogson, supporter relations officer for the Dog's Trust, said the staff and volunteers do their best to treat the dogs to make them feel at home.

She said: 'We have one dog here that needs medication and is very choosy with his food. He only eats fish pie - so we go out and get him fish pie and mix up his medication in there.

'If a dog needs fish pie, we'll get him fish pie. We will spoil them to the best of our ability.'

Despite their age, there is a long list of people waiting to adopt the abandoned pets.

No dog is too old and a 17-year-old was recently adopted into a loving home.

Lee said: 'A lot of the dogs find themselves in our care through no fault of their own.

'If they find themselves here we want them to enjoy themselves as much as possible.

'We've made Oakfield Oldies as close to a home environment as possible, they are old dogs and are used to a nice comfy sofa.

'When people think of dogs homes they think it's a dark place but it's a bright, happy place which is run by dogs - it's like a real home.' 

Comfy: Each room is furnished perfectly for pets, with donated cushions, dog beds, so they are comfortable
