Four teenage boys just weeks from starting ninth grade together have died after a pickup truck collided with their tractor, police said.

Sean Kenneally, Mitchell Kluesner, Nicholas Kramer and Bryce Wilwert - all aged 14 - died when the pickup missed a stop sign and plowed into their John Deere utility near an Epworth, Iowa intersection about 1.30pm Saturday.

The boys, preparing to begin their freshman year at Western Dubuque High School, had spent the morning filling water balloons before the Epworth Town & Country Days parade.

The pickup driver, 24-year-old Joe Connolly who was hauling a livestock trailer, was not injured.

His two passengers, 25-year-old Joe Lucas of Epworth and 21-year-old Elissa Ericson of Cedar Rapids, were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, according to The Gazette.

Lucas was later transferred to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City but was listed in stable condition.

The Dubuque County Sheriff’s Department said it was investigating and working with prosecutors on what charges may be filed.

'We’re 
going to try to meet with the families today to figure out what the kids
 were doing,' Dale Snyder, Dubuque County Sheriff’s Office captain and 
Epworth Fire Department firefighter, told KCRG.

'There are a lot of questions we have to get answers on today that we didn’t want to press the families on.'

He
 said the investigation was further complicated because one of the 
victims, Mitchell Kluesner, was the son of Epworth Fire Department 
lieutenant Todd Kluesner. The boy hoped to follow in his father's 
footsteps one day.

Tribute: Community members gathered for a prayer service on Monday at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Peosta, Iowa, for four boys who died Saturday in a crash south of Epworth, Iowa

Drexler Middle School Principal Mary Jane Maher said the communities of Epworth, Peosta and Dyersville were in disbelief at the loss of the boys, who wrestled and played basketball at school.

'They were four fantastic young gentlemen. All of them highly involved in school, not only athletics but involved in school in as many ways as could be,' Maher said.

'They were the kind of kids that you love to have in class, always bringing something to the classroom to make people smile. Just four really good kids from four amazing families.'

Residents of the small Iowa town are  grasping to make sense of the tragic loss of four young lives.

The teens had spent the morning tossing water balloons along the parade route, with people along the parade route tossing them back - a town tradition for kids on the wrestling float.

'They were having fun as a team - and then this,' said Paul Cleary, the wrestling coach at Western Dubuque High School in Epworth, told THONLINE.com.

Scene: Skid marks remain at the intersection of Hartbecke Road and East Pleasant Grove Road near Epworth, Iowa where four boys were killed on Saturday

The four boys were riding on a John Deere Gator, a four-wheeled utility vehicle often used on farms with two seats in front and a flatbed behind the seats for hauling.

It's not immediately clear where the boys were headed, but they may have been going to Wilwert's farm, Cleary said.

The utility vehicle isn't licensed for road use in Iowa but can legally be operated on public roads if the use involves farm work. It also can be operated by someone as young as 14 for farming purposes, Dubuque County Sheriff Capt. Dale Snyder said.

The Western Dubuque Community School District, Iowa's largest by geographic area encompassing 555 square miles, is planning to make counselors available for families, Maher said.

The Rev. Michael Schueller, of St. Elizabeth Pastorate in Epworth, said Sunday services were somber but typical of what happens in small, closely knit farming communities when people need support and help.

'These are small towns. The people are pretty resilient. They come together with families and friends in particular and especially in their faith,' he said.

Community members gathered for a prayer service on Monday at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Peosta, Iowa, to pay tribute to the boys.

A local restaurant has donated food for the funeral dinners for the families and caskets for the boys have been donated by Trappist Caskets, a business operated by Roman Catholic monks since 1849 at the New Melleray Abbey near Peosta.
