A teenage who boy bought his younger sister a teddy bear from an Alabama thrift store wasn't prepared for what lay inside. 

Joshua Scott found an urn containing ashes hidden in a zipped compartment of the soft toy he purchased at the Second Chance Thrift Shop in Dothan last month.

The 15-year-old only made the unsettling discovery when he took the bear back home and felt something hard through the toy animal's fur.

A teddy bear purchased at a thrift store by a Dothan, Alabama, family had a shocking surprise inside: an urn.

His family is now desperately searching for the original owner of the bear.

'A child could be missing a bear, it could be a parent. I mean it could be one of our soldiers. We don't know,' the Alabama teenager's mother, Samantha Scott, said during an interview with local WSFA-TV News.

'And it could be the one thing that child has to hug and love up to that's still a part of them. It could be a parent who's lost their child. Who knows what? So, it's just important that we find the owner.'

The thrift store where the bear was purchased say they have no idea who dropped off the toy originally because of the huge amount of donations that are received each day. 

On the hunt: So far, Scott and his mom have visited several funeral homes in the area, but have not been able to track down the original owners of the bear

Unwelcome discovery: Joshua says one night while holding the bear he felt something hard inside and when he unzipped the back of the bear he found a small urn

Several funeral homes in the area were contacted but so far there haven't been any leads.

The family hope all of the publicity will lead to the discovery of the rightful owner of the little brown stuffed animal.

Mystery: The thrift store has not been able to help the Scotts find the bear's donor. They said they receive up 10 carloads of donations everyday, and don't typically keep written records of who donates what
