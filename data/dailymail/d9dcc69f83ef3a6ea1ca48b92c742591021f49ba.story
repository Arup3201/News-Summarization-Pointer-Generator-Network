Ryan Babel's time at Liverpool wasn't particularly memorable, but Anfield still seems to hold a place in his heart after the Dutch winger released a clothing range branded 'YNWA'.

The 27-year-old was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007 and spent four uninspiring seasons on Merseyside - where arguably his most remarkable act was receiving a £10,000 fine for posting a picture of then referee Howard Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt on his Twitter account.

The former Holland international, who is now plying his trade for mid-table Kasimpasa in the Turkish Super Lig, returned to social media to reveal his fashion range bearing the acronym of Liverpool's famous 'You'll Never Walk Alone' anthem.

No promotional video is complete without a thumping soundtrack and moody stare into the distance

The streetwear range appears to include baseball caps, beanies and sweatshirts emblazoned with the YNWA logo - which Liverpool fans may be pleased to learn comes in colours that co-ordinate with a Bentley sports car.

The release is also accompanied by a promotional video featuring the player dressing up in a restaurant before roaming the streets of Istanbul nodding his head to a hip hop soundtrack... as you do.

Whether the Dutchman's choice of brand name will endear himself to Reds fans - who may remember him better as 'Babelcopter' after a failed aerial dash to London to sign for Totenham or West Ham in 2010 - remains to be seen. 

The former Holland international spent four uninspiring seasons at Liverpool between 2007-11
