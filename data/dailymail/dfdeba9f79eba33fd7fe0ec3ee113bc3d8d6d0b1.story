A teenager has credited her favourite jeans with saving her life after she noticed they were becoming too tight.

Emily Clark, 16, noticed her size six jeans suddenly didn’t fit her as normal when she went out with friends.

She then noticed two hard lumps in her stomach, which scans revealed to be cancer.

Emily Clark, 16, was diagnosed with cancer after noticing her favourite jeans had suddenly become too tight

Sixth-former Emily said: ‘My jeans felt really tight and I thought my tummy was bigger than normal.

‘I didn’t feel ill at all but I knew something wasn’t quite right.

‘Thank goodness for those tight jeans - they probably helped to save my life’.

Emily, of Llantarnam, near Cwmbran, South Wales, went for a check-up with her doctor after noticing her jeans didn't fit.

Emily went to see her doctor after noticing she had become bloated and that there were two hard lumps in her abdomen. Tests revealed she had non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Emily had to have months of chemotherapy before finally being told she was in remission

She was asked if she was pregnant or constipated and when she said she wasn't, further tests were ordered.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system.

This is the network of vessels and glands in the body.

Clear fluid, called lymph, flows through the lymphatic system and it contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects these lymphocytes causing them to multiply in an abnormal way and to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system.

Affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making the patient vulnerable to infections.

The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node - usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

The cancer can also cause night sweats, weight loss, fever and fatigue.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in people of any age but is most common in people over the age of 65.

Treatment usually involves chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Two scans later later revealed the tumours in her abdomen and devastatingly, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

During a four month stay in hospital she was given four rounds of intensive chemotherapy.

She lost her long auburn hair and became very thin - but says she refused to feel sorry for herself.

She said: ‘There was no “Why me?”

'I just thought: “This is a bit rubbish, let’s get on with it”.’

Six months later, Emily is at home recovering after being told the cancer is in remission.

She now wants encourage more people to donate bone marrow and blood.

Inspired by teenage fundraiser Stephen Sutton, who raised more than £4 million for the Teenager Cancer Trust while fighting incurable bowel cancer, she has set up her own campaign - remissionpossible.org.uk

The campaign aims to encourage people to give blood, join the bone marrow donor register or to fundraise for charity.

She said: ‘I don’t think what happened to me is a tragedy.

'A positive attitude is what has kept me going through it all.

‘But being told I was in remission was amazing. It was the best day ever.

'It was so much relief. My mum didn’t stop crying for hours.

‘Now I want to help others thrive and survive during treatment.’

Her mother, Donna, said: ‘The only symptom was her jeans were too tight.

‘When Emily lay down you could see two large lumps. They were growing so fast you could also see it happening.

‘But we are just so glad that it was caught in time - and Emily has been so brave and positive.’
