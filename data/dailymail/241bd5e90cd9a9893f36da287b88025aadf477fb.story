When three-year-old Colton Burpo was rushed to hospital with a burst appendix, doctors didn't think he could survive the surgery needed to save him.

However, not only did the little boy from Imperial, Nebraska, make an astonishingly speedy recovery, he claimed that while surgeons were fighting to keep him alive, he visited heaven, sat on Jesus's lap and patted his rainbow-striped horse.

It's a remarkable story and one that has taken the US box-office by storm this Easter, raking in $22.5million (£13.4million) in its opening weekend and nearly $52million (£31million) overall so far.

Colton Burpo, now 14, claims he visited heaven while undergoing surgery aged three

Colton's father Todd, a part-time fireman and Baptist preacher played by Oscar-nominee Greg Kinnear in the film, and mother, Sonja - played by English actress Kelly Reilly - at first didn't believe their son but found themselves being won over as he recounted more details of his experience, The Mirror reports.

The boy, who is now 14, told of how he rose out of his body on the surgical table and saw his father cursing God and his mother weeping - which is what they claim they were doing at the time.

He also says he met his great-grandfather and his sister, who was lost in a miscarriage a year before he was born - both people his parents say they have never mentioned to him.

While in heaven, Colton says he met a blue-eyed, brown-haired Jesus, chatted with John the Baptist and saw the Virgin Mary praying at God's throne, all the time serenaded by a choir of angels singing Jesus Loves You.

Colton, who is now a high-school wrestling star and promising musician, uses his experiences to comfort terminally ill children and their families, talking with them via Skype.

He said: 'It helps the kids realise, "Hey, I don’t have to deal with all this pain... I got something better waiting for me."

'It also helps the family. It reassures them because if you go to heaven you’re going to have the time of your life.

'I’m not scared of dying because I know where I’m going.'

Critics have dismissed Colton's claims, some even suggesting they are being exaggerated to drive sales of his father's book, also called Heaven Is for Real.

Atheist author Susan Jacoby wrote in The Washington Post: 'Only in America could this book be classified as non-fiction.

'At age four, an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality is charming. But among American adults, widespread identification with the mind of a ­pre-schooler is scary.'

Even the director of the film, which opens in the UK on May 9, Randall Wallace - who made his name as a writer for movies like Braveheart and Pearl Harbour - said: 'It was crucial I had doubts about Colton’s story.

'If someone is trying to convince me of a dogma, I’m not interested.

'But if someone is recounting an ­authentic experience, I’m fascinated.'

However, even a decade on, Mr Burpo is adamantly standing by his son's visions.

He said: 'There’s no medical explanation for all this – there is only a heavenly one.

'We seem to avoid talking about things like life and death until we are confronted with them, like at a funeral.

'But it can be comforting to know there is more out there.'
