They are the brilliant young, French pair with growing reputations and destined for big-money transfers. So how did Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane, both 21, fare in the World Cup quarter final against Germany?

The problem with being a graceful, stylish, youthful central defender, is that a bigger, brutish heavyweight can always come along and flatten you.

Rio Ferdinand used to have the same problem. Playing for West Ham against Everton one Saturday afternoon, he tried to nutmeg Duncan Ferguson… and suffered the consequence. It was a painful lesson.

Harry 
Redknapp, his manager at the time, praised him for trying to dribble out
 from the back and said that he had to make those mistakes to learn from
 them. Maybe that’s why Harry had so much success developing young 
players: you can’t kill them every time they cock it up.

One
 hopes Raphael Varane, the wonderful Real Madrid player, will get as 
much sympathy in France after Germany scored the only goal of this 
knock-out tie.

A
 hanging free kick from Bastien Schweinsteiger looped into the French 
box and Varane rose, a little off balance, but the favourite to clear 
his lines.

However,
 quite simply, he was bullied out of it by Mats Hummels, his German 
counterpart. The ball should have been heading for the fringes of the 
box, but the German got a run on Varane, who was all gangling arms and 
legs.

With one powerful, booming header, France were heading out of the World Cup.

Shackled: Varane prevented World Cup specialist Miroslav Klose from scoring, but the damage was done

Perhaps
 it was a routine the Germans had worked on in training. After all, 
Varane weighs just under 12 stone, while Hummels has two stone on him.

In WBA boxing terms, one is a super-middleweight, the other is a cruiserweight. And this was a knock-out moment.

If Varane is to, one day, play in the Barclays Premier League, he will have to learn to deal with that.

Not that Real Madrid are in any hurry to sell him and why should he want to scarper from Spain?

The
 goal was a victory for those who like their centre halves big and 
meaty, the sort of warrior kick-and-crush brigade championed by World 
Cup winner Jack Charlton, who once said that ‘if centre halves could 
play they would be bloody midfielders’.

Franz
 Beckenbauer, Bobby Moore and quite a few others would contest that. 
Ferdinand too was cut from a different cloth, as is Varane.

It was little surprise when Ferdinand last week suggested Manchester United should sign the young Frenchman to replace him.

When
 asked on Twitter which central defenders he would sign for United, 
Ferdinand replied: 'Varane…Real Madrid won't sell though.' Chelsea are 
among the clubs who are said to be keen to test that theory.

They
 have also been linked strongly with Pogba, the former Manchester United
 trainee whom Gary Lineker said would be one of the young stars of this 
tournament.

He has shown his ability in flashes, but crucially, those long legs committed the foul that led to Germany taking the lead.

It
 was not what these two young men hoped would be their legacy in this 
game: one gave away the free kick and the other failed to deal with it.
