They've been keeping a low profile at the Middletons' Bucklebury mansion ever since the birth of their baby son George on 22 July, but now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are slowly edging their way back into the limelight.

Although Kate has stayed at home minding the third-in-line to the throne (helped by her parents Carole and Michael), Prince William has nipped out to attend a public polo match and, yesterday, the Anglesey Show, where he briefly discussed how he is enjoying fatherhood.

And now he has given his first full interview since the birth of Prince George, described as 'animated', and to be screened on CNN and ITV next month in the documentary Prince William's Passion: New Father, New Hope..

In the interview - filmed at 
Kensington Palace and given to CNN's Max Foster and, for ITV, award-winning documentary-maker Jane 
Treays - Prince William reflects on fatherhood and discusses how becoming a parent has forever changed him.

The special, which premieres on CNN on Sunday 15 September at 1pm, also chronicles the Prince’s 
passion for Africa and wildlife conservation, and his dream to help save the world's most endangered 
species.

As a new father, the Prince discusses his hope that one day 
his son can experience the same Africa that he and Prince Harry did as 
young boys.

The Duke discusses how much he hopes George will one day share his enthusiasm for Africa and conservation, explaining the pivotal role the continent has played in
his life.

A portion of the interview will air on CNN’s New Day on Monday, August 
19th at 8:00 AM ET (12pm BST on CNN International). In it, the Prince 
reflects on becoming a new parent and how it has forever changed him.

Speaking of the interview, Foster 
said: 'I've never seen him so animated. We had lots of time with him and
he was on great form. I'm thrilled with the interview.'

During the rare interview Prince William shares his joy at becoming a father, talks about 
his hopes for his new family, and delves into his passion for wildlife 
conservation.

He reflects on continuing a Royal legacy in the continent, 
building on his father's conservation work and Princess Diana's 
humanitarian campaigns.

The Duke spoke about his son yesterday during an appearance at an agricultural show on Anglesey, describing Prince George as a 'pretty loud but of course very good-looking'.

William, an RAF search and rescue 
helicopter pilot, also confirmed he would be leaving his Anglesey home 
and moving 'elsewhere' when his military posting on the Welsh island 
comes to an end next month.

He has almost completed his three-year 
tour of duty and is widely expected to return to London with Kate and 
son George to take on more royal duties rather than stay in the service.

A spokeswoman for ITV said: 'Prince William also talks about his love of Africa, his commitment to wildlife conservation and his hope that Prince George will one day share these passions.

'He explains the pivotal part that Africa has played in his life and reflects on continuing a royal legacy in the continent, building on his father's conservation work and Princess Diana's humanitarian campaigns.'

As patron of Tusk Trust, a UK charity 
that funds African conservation projects, the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge will be guests of honour at the inaugural Tusk Conservation 
Awards on 12 September, to honour unsung heroes of wildlife 
conservation.

Prince William's passion for Africa goes back a long way - for his 21st birthday party in 2003 at Windsor Castle he had an 'Out of Africa' theme, and flew in the Shakarimba band, pictured, from Botswana to perform

The documentary will include coverage 
of the awards-presentation by the Prince, as well as exclusive footage of the 
Duke and Duchess meeting nominees at a private reception.

The 
event will mark one of the first public appearances of the Duke and 
Duchess following the birth of Prince George.

The documentary was commissioned for ITV by Jo Clinton-Davis, controller of factual.

Jo says: 'The documentary offers 
viewers a unique and rare insight into the true passions in Prince 
William's life, Africa, wildlife conservation and, above all, his 
family.'

The joint documentary is being produced by Spun Gold TV in partnership with CNN.

It will be screened on ITV in September and premieres on CNN 15 September at 13:00 BST. 

Like his brother Prince Harry, William has always had a special relationship with Africa, ever since he became aware of the work his mother Princess Diana was doing to publicise the plight of a large percentage of the continent's people.

Diana drew attention to some of Africa's poorest countries, raising awareness of the AIDS crisis, food shortages and live landmines.

Princess Diana last visited Angola in 
southern Africa in 1997, months before she died in a car crash in 
Paris.

He spent time on safari at the wildlife conservancy owned by the family of his close friend Jecca Craig, and got involved in game conservation to learn about Africa's wildlife and environment.

William returned to Africa several times, building strong bonds with the place and its people, and held an 'Out Of Africa' themed 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle.

In 2010 he took his 
long-term girlfriend on holiday to Kenya, the country he has described 
as his second home, and proposed to her 12,500ft above sea level, he 
proposed, against the spectacular backdrop of the Rift Valley.

Kenya itself was significant: it was there in 1952, at the Treetops lodge in Nyeri, that young Princess Elizabeth learned she had become queen following the death of her father George VI.

William
and Kate returned to the southern hemisphere for their honeymoon in 
2011, enjoying a private holiday on the Seychelles islands, off the 
coast of Madagascar and Zanzibar.
