He then forced her to the ground at gunpoint.  While on the ground, she was able to pull her handgun from her pocket and she shot the assailant in the face.

'She had no other choice. She must have been in fear for her life and she reacted,' Capt. Stephen Fore, of the Dekalb County Police Department, told WSB-TV.

Authorities found Stevenson later in a yard and arrested him, but investigators say the pizza delivery may have been a set up, according to FOX News.

Police say a second suspect carjacked the woman's silver 2000 Honda Accord and is still on the run. 

Not Fired: The woman feared losing her job, but the pizza company said the woman would not be fired from its Columbia Drive location 

Stevenson was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in serious condition and police charged him with armed robbery. 

The woman was not arrested and authorities say she acted out of self defense.  

The woman's mother told WSB-TV Tuesday that though her daughter is still shaken from the encounter, she fears losing her job. 

But the company, which prohibits employees from carrying firearms on the job, announced Thursday that the woman would not be fired, but would be assigned to a role inside of the store, FOX news reports.

'The safety of Papa John's employees is a top priority for our company,' the company told Fox.

Threats: Some commented on the  Facebook page threatening to boycott the company if the woman was fired due to the incident

Save: In an effort to save the woman's job, one man created the hashtag #savethedeliverygirlsjob

New Car: One man commended the woman's action saying she deserves a new car from the company and a raise 

The company also said that though it does not plan to change its policy regarding utilizing firearms while on the job, they considered the facts of the situation and decided that the woman would keep her job at the restaurant's Columbia Drive location.

The company also said the woman would be offered counseling to help her 'recuperate from the incident.' 

The company's decision came a day after many people commented on the Papa John's Facebook page urging the company not to fire the woman. 

Some even threatened to boycott the company if the woman was fired due to the incident. 

One woman wrote: 'Fire that woman and you will lose me and my family as a customer.'
