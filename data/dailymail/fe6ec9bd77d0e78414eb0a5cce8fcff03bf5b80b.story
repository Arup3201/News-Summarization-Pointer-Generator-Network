Blessing Okagbare was utterly dominant as she helped to ease the memory of London 2012 by winning Commonwealth gold in the women's 100m.

The 25-year-old finished last in the Olympic final, but won the first of three possible individual titles in Glasgow as she powered to glory in the 100m in a new Games record of 10.85secs. Her freshly dyed golden hair shone just as much as her performance.

The Nigerian, who will also contest the 200m and long jump, stayed relaxed to power past experienced Jamaicans Veronica Campbell-Brown and Kerron Stewart, who finished second and third in 11.03secs and 11.07secs, in the last 50m.
