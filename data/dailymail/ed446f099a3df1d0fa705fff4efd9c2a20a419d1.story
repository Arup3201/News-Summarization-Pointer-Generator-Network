A former Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader who later became a teacher and was arrested for having sex with a teenage student has lost her $338,000 judgement against gossip site thedirty.com.

A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge in Cincinnati, Ohio, today overturned a lower court decision in favor Sarah Jones and said thedirty.com founder Nik Richie couldn't be held liable for nasty comments about Jones that users submitted to the site.

One of the comments claimed she had had sex with the entire Cincinnati Bengals football team. Another claimer her now-ex husband cheated on her multiple times and gave her two sexually transmitted infections. Jones said the posts were untrue and caused her severe mental anguish and embarrassment.

Ms Jones, a former Ben-Gals cheerleader, made national headlines in 2012 when she was arrested for having sex with a 17-year-old former Dixie Heights High School student - who is ten years her junior.

Rise to fame: Sarah Jones, now 29, filed the lawsuit against thedirty.com in 2009 for comments left by anonymous users claiming she had sexually transmitted infections

She was married at the time, but left her husband and claimed in her defense that she and the teen, Cody York were in love. She struck a plea deal that kept her out of jail, but barred her from teaching for life. The posts at issue in the lawsuit were not related to the criminal case.

Ms Jones and Mr York, now a 19-year-old Northern Kentucky University student, are engaged.

In July, federal Judge William Bertelsman rejected arguments from Richie's attorneys that the publisher should be immune from lawsuit. A jury later found the posts about Jones were substantially false and that Richie had acted with malice or reckless disregard by publishing them, and awarded Jones $338,000.

In Monday's ruling, a three-judge appeals panel said Bertelsman should have granted Richie immunity, citing the federal Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that gives websites immunity from liability for content posted by users.

Judges and courts across the country have upheld the law hundreds of times, including other lawsuits involving Richie's website. Bertelsman did the opposite, finding that the very name of Richie's website, the way he manages it and the personal comments he adds to many posts encourage offensive content.

The 6th Circuit's decision reverses Bertelsman's ruling and means Jones does not get the $338,000 award.

Nik Richie, the founder and owner of Arizona-based thedirty.com, has fought the ruling and said he didn't write the comments that said nasty things about Ms Jones

'I feel like one of those lawyers who 
has a client that just got out of death row from DNA and he's been 
sitting there for 20 years and we find out he was innocent all along,' 
said Richie's attorney, David Gingras, from his office in Scottsdale, 
Arizona.

'You're happy that he's out of jail but you're really not happy it took so long to get there.'

Jones' Cincinnati attorney, Chris Roach, said he is planning to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.

'(Richie) is using those basic editorial functions and the Communications Decency Act to get people to submit defamatory material so he can post it,' Roach said. 'That just doesn't go with the spirit of the law.'

Richie's website allows users to submit anonymous posts about anyone from the girl next door to professional athletes and politicians, often accusing them of promiscuity, criticizing their plastic surgery or picking apart their looks. Richie screens each post, decides what goes up and frequently adds commentary.

Internet heavyweights and free speech advocates had filed court briefs blasting Bertelsman's decision and warning that it could chill speech.

"If websites are subject to liability for failing to remove third-party content whenever someone objects, they will be subject to the 'heckler's veto,' giving anyone who complains unfettered power to censor speech," according to joint briefs filed by lawyers for Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Amazon, Gawker and BuzzFeed, among others.

Jack Greiner, a First Amendment attorney who represented many of the Internet companies, said Monday that "the consequences could have been very problematic" if Bertelsman's ruling stood.

"The concerns that Amazon and CNN and BuzzFeed and the other clients were as much as anything, to try to avoid the uncertainty that would have resulted," Greiner said. "Say a conservative website says, 'If you've got dirt on Obama, send it in,' would that make that website the creator of that content (and liable)? Under the trial court's ruling I think it could."
