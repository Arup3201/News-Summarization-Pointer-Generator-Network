A pioneering brain doctor who was unfairly sacked for following his conscience is staging a hunger strike in protest at the 'unfair' treatment of whistleblowers by the NHS.

Dr Narinder Kapur, 62, a world authority on brain behaviour, lost his job at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, in 2010.

The former president of the British Neuropsychological Society claimed he was kicked out for blowing the whistle over underqualified and unsupervised staff treating patients at the hospital - a practice he claimed was endangering patients.

Protest: Dr Narinder Kapur is confronted by security staff outside the Department of Health in London.

An employment tribunal went on to rule he had been unfairly dismissed, but he was not reinstated.

The doctor today staged the second day of a five day hunger strike outside the Department of Health head office, to protest his and other colleague's treatment for raising concerns about the health service.

Dr Kapur believes the NHS is rife with 'failures' and feels staff are not treated or managed correctly, which has lead to the mistreatment of patients.

He is calling on the government to impose a complete change to the health service and get rid of a 'dictatorial and secretive' management structure.

Dr Kapur will camp outside the building in Westminster, London, for the whole week and if he gets moved on he will decamp to the statue of Gandhi, who has inspired him, in Tavistock square.

Dr Kapur said: 'I undertake this five-day hunger-strike with reluctance but with resolve.

'It pains my heart to see how failures in the NHS have contributed directly or indirectly to harming patient care, to a waste of public funds and to distress for NHS staff and their families.

'Over the past two years, I have repeatedly raised my concerns in a wide range of settings - NHS, legal and political - but with no tangible outcome to fix these failures in the NHS.

'I am fortunate that God has given me the strength, knowledge, experience, determination, resources and good health to be able to make a protest in this way.

'I regard it as a moral and ethical responsibility to do what I can to bring about changes in the NHS that will benefit a large number of people.

'I take my inspiration from the actions and words of Mahatma Gandhi, whose birthday is this week on October 2, and who also engaged in peaceful protests that included fasting.'

During Dr Kapur’s tribunal in July the panel ruled the hospital attempted to fast-track his dismissal by rehearsing witnesses after an investigation was launched into his conduct.

The judgement read: 'The principal reason for Dr Kapur’s dismissal was the fact there had been an irredeemable breakdown in trust, confidence and communication between himself on the one hand and a variety of management individuals within the trust organisation.'

However, the tribunal found Dr Kapur, who had clashed with staff over how neuropsychology clinics should be run, was 75 per cent responsible for his own downfall.

As a result, the panel said he would only receive 25 per cent of any compensation and would not return to work at the hospital.

A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'We have taken action to support NHS whistleblowers, including strengthening the NHS constitution and setting up a new helpline to advise staff and help them understand their rights.

'Staff on the frontline know when patient care needs to improve - better support for whistleblowers will help create a culture where staff will be able to raise genuine concerns in good faith, without fear of reprisal.'
