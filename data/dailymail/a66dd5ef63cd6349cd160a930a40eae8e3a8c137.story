A guitar teacher was devastated when her home was burgled and her guitar - signed by her hero, country singer Glenn Campbell - went missing.

But when Laurie Marsell, from Seminole County in Florida, faced up to burglar, Joseph Copeland, 55, in court she told him: 'No one is going to come into my home and do this and get away with it - it's not going to happen.'

Mrs Marsell was determined to retrieve everything stolen during the break-in.

She said: 'People have no right to come into your home and just take things that are precious to you.'

When Laurie Marsell, from Seminole County in Florida, faced up to burglar, Joseph Copeland, 55, in court she told him: 'No one is going to come into my home and do this and get away with it - it's not going to happen'

The guitar was stolen in late 2012 but once Copeland was in prison he wrote to Mrs Marsell.

In his letter he said: 'I want you to know how truly sorry I am.'

She replied to Copeland and asked him to tell her where her stolen belongings were located.

Mrs Marsell was astounded when he sent back a treasure map leading to the stolen instrument.

'He sent me a map and very very detailed directions as to where they were,' Mrs Marsell said.

And Copeland closed his letter with 'Laurie I am truly sorry for this violation in your life.

'I can only pray and do all I can to make amends.'

When investigators followed the map, they found Mrs Marsell's guitar and now she is playing the instrument once again.

The guitar teacher regarded the instrument as one of her most prized possessions.

Country singer Glenn Campbell, known for songs such as Gentle On My Mind and Rhinestone Cowboy, signed the guitar for the fan after one of his concerts.

Yet despite temporarily losing her most prized possession, Mrs Marsell told NBC: 'Call it crazy but i never lost faith.'

She said: 'I think that really touched his heart when I said maybe no one has ever prayed for you before.'

And burglar Copeland also benefited from the gesture after the prosecutor asked for his time behind bars to be shortened from 15 to 14 years.
