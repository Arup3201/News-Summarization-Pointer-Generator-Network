There’s a brave flash of red lipstick and a touch of blusher for the occasion, but no amount of make-up can disguise the pain on Nilam Hindocha’s face. Her world is in ruins.

It is three years since her beautiful daughter Anni Dewani was kidnapped and shot dead in South Africa on her honeymoon, a murder so compelling in its terrible details.

Few cases have been more exhaustively examined, to the continuing distress of the Hindochas.

And this is what has driven Nilam to defy the effects of a long battle with cancer and make a painful journey from her home in Sweden to London, where Anni’s British bridegroom Shrien Dewani is fighting extradition, accused of arranging her murder.

Stress: Grieving Nilam Hindocha says she feels sorry for her son-in-law who is suspected of arranging the murder of her daughter Anni

Nilam, 62, is giving her first account of her family’s ordeal because she is driven by a desperate need to know what really happened to her daughter. Without the answer, she says, a corrosive mix of sorrow and suspicion will surely kill her too.

It is all the more remarkable, then, that she can sympathise with the plight of the chief suspect, who remains in a secure mental hospital with post-traumatic stress and depression.

‘I feel sorry for Shrien,’ she says. ‘He is my son-in-law and he is as ruined by this as we are. He is ill, and I have sympathy with him. His life is broken for ever.

‘But he will get the chance to get better. What about my Anni? What about her life?’

‘I believed Shrien was truly in love with my daughter,’ she continues. ‘I just need him to tell me what happened. If he cannot, I will never, ever get over this. 

‘I’ve lost my beautiful daughter. Unless he tells me the whole story –  this stress is killing me.’

Today there is no communication between the Dewani and Hindocha families. Last week they appeared in court together for the latest round of Shrien’s fight against extradition, but the mutual animosity was hard to disguise.

Tragic: Beautiful Anni Dewani was murdered on her honeymoon

It is a sad end to a 40-year 
friendship between the families, struck when part of the Hindocha clan 
settled in Britain after Idi Amin’s 1972 purge of Ugandan Asians. 
Meanwhile Anni’s side of the family settled in Sweden.

It
 had seemed appropriate when in 2010 two good-looking children – 
30-year-old Shrien, a millionaire businessman, and Anni, 28 – were 
married in a lavish £200,000 ceremony in Mumbai.

As the world now knows, the happiness 
was short-lived. The Hindochas had only just returned to Sweden when 
they received the phone call from Shrien saying Anni had been kidnapped.

Ill-fated: Shrien and Anni Dewani married in 2010

‘We hadn’t even unpacked,’ recalls Vinod Hindocha, Anni’s 64-year-old father. ‘Dewani called me and said, “Dad, I couldn’t take care of your daughter.” I said, “Shrien, she’s not dead. I’m coming, we’ll pay them whatever they want and we’ll get her back.”

‘But he just said it again, “I could not take care of your daughter.” ’ As if he knew her fate already.’

Mr Hindocha got the next flight to South Africa, but during a stop-over in Amsterdam was told the nightmare news that Anni had been found, dead, in an abandoned taxi.

The circumstances of her death seemed strange from that first call. According to Dewani, Anni had wanted to see ‘the real Africa’ so they hired a taxi driver to take them to Gugulethu township, a dangerous suburb of Cape Town where their car was hijacked at gunpoint.

To this day, Anni’s mother cannot understand why her daughter would have wanted to go to such a place.

‘Shrien knew that area was not good,’ Mrs Hindocha says. ‘No one really goes there at night. They were staying in Cape Grace Hotel and she would have loved the nightlife around there. She would never have recommended they go to Gugulethu in the middle of the night.’  

When Dewani was named as a suspect by South African authorities, Nilam and Vinod were shocked.

‘How can you ever think that about the man you gave your little baby away to?’ asks Mr Hindocha.

But the South African police had no such doubts. They accused Dewani of paying the couple’s taxi driver, Zolo Tongo, to arrange for a hitman to kill his new wife and make it look like the work of violent criminals.

Their car was hijacked at gunpoint. Dewani claims the criminals let him and Tongo go, before driving off with his bride. Anni was never seen alive again.

Tongo told South African police he had been approached by Dewani and asked to organise the killing. His 25-year sentence for murder was cut by seven years in return for this testimony.

South African and British Police began a new line of enquiry in 2011 after Leopold Leisser, a German male prostitute, claimed Dewani had paid for sex sessions with him.

He also said Shrien, who made his money through the family care home business, had told him he needed to find a way out of his engagement, but could not do so easily for fear of being disowned by his family.

Dewani strenuously denies these accusations and says he is not gay.

Anni took a year off between finishing university and finding a job to care for her mother following the discovery that Nilam had cancer of the uterus in 2006.

Thankfully, she is now clear of cancer, but the side effects of the treatment continue to plague her.

‘The doctors say she should not have any stress,’ says Mr Hindocha. ‘But every day is a stress for her with this case. Shrien’s lawyer is always saying, “his health, his health, his health”. Has she thought of our health?‘

Meanwhile, the case grinds on. At Westminster magistrates’ court last week, Dewani’s defence team asked for a six-month adjournment, arguing Dewani’s recovery could be irreparably damaged if he was extradited.

Shrien remains at a secure Bristol mental hospital and did not attend the hearing, being deemed mentally unfit.

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle will rule on the case later this month.
