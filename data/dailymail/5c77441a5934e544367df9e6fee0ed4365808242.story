Australia's most notorious drug smuggler is set to be freed on parole after spending the last nine years languishing in an Indonesian prison.

Schapelle Corby was convicted in 2005 of carrying 4.1kilos of marijuana into the holiday resort of Bali, hidden in her body board bag.

She has always vehemently denied her guilt and claimed the drugs were planted on her by a criminal gang operating at an Australian airport, but she was jailed for 20 years.

Now, Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin said he has given his approval for her release.

Jailed: Schapelle Corby is sentenced to 20 years in jail by Denpasar District Court in Bali in 2005 for smuggling 4.2 kilogrammes of marijuana into the resort island of Bali

He told a press conference in Jakarta 
today: 'Corby has been approved to receive parole because (she) has 
fulfilled the substantive and administrative requirements set by 
ministry regulation number 21 of year 2013.'

The 36-year-old, from the Australian tourist resort strip, the Gold Coast, will have to wait until next week when all the paper work can be completed before she is finally able to leaveBali's Kerobokan Prison, officials said.

Bali's Kerobokan prison's govenor Farid Junaedi today liaised with Corby and her family and Australian Consulate officials to sort out the details of her release.

'We are still waiting. I am yet to know about the process in Jakarta. We are now just waiting. I haven't receive the letter as of now,' he told News.com.au.

This is the culmination of a long-running bid by Corby and her family to have released for a crime they insist she did not commit.

In 2010, Corby asked for clemency, citing 
her poor mental state. Two years later, Indonesia's president cut her 
sentence by five years.

Corby, who has been eligible for parole for the past 18-month, is said to be in 'good spirits' and 'hopeful' of being released.

Her brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha said the former beauty therapist was healthy and happy and all the family was praying she is released soon.

Corby's sister Mercedes smiled as she climbed on board a motorbike behind husband Wayan, Corby's parole guarantor.

In October 8, 2004, Corby is arrested on arrival at Denpasar airport in Bali after heading there for a surfing trip.

Her bodyboard case is packed with 4.1kg of marijuana.

She repeatedly argued the drugs found by airport officials in her unlocked bag were not hers and that they were planted.

Her lawyers insisted many people could have put the drugs into their client's bodyboard bag along the way from Brisbane to Bali, especially because it was not locked.

Corby, from Australia's eastern Gold 
Coast, changed planes in Sydney and her defence team said she was the 
victim of a drug ring running narcotics from Brisbane to Sydney.

For some reason, the drugs were not removed from her bag by the criminals in Sydney, the defence said.

On April 28, 2005, Corby pleads with the court to consider her innocence in her final statement.

'I
 would like to say to the prosecutors I cannot admit to a crime I did 
not commit. And to the judges, my life at the moment is in your hands 
but I would prefer if my life was in your hearts.'

Handing
 down a sentence of 20 years, Judge Linton Sirait said: 'The panel of 
judges declares the defendant legally and convincingly guilty of the 
crime of illegal importation of narcotics.'

Corby's mother, Rosleigh Rose, shouted at the three judges on the panel: 'Liar, liar. Honey, we are going to take you home.'

Corby had her sentence cut to 15 years in 2005, with it increased back to 20 years on appealCorby's final appeal was rejected in 2008, with the original ruling declared 'accurate and correct'.

In 2010, in a last-ditch effort to reduce her sentence, Corby begs for clemency due to her mental illness. She claims her life is at risk. Two years later, her sentence is slashed by five years.

This week, Indonesia's Justice Minister Amir Samsyuddin announces he will sign her parole papers and that she is likely to be freed next week.

'We don't know, we just can pray. We met Schapelle, she is healthy, she is happy. We only pray, pray and pray. Only God knows,' he told News.com.au.

Despite being within days of freedom, a prison insider told News.com.au that Corby had yet to pack up her belongings.

'She hasn't packed yet. She doesn't want to get her expectations up and then be disappointed... Too many times in the past her hopes had been dashed.' the source said.

Under her parole conditions Corby must remain in Bali until the expiration of her sentence in mid 2016 and then must stay an extra year under supervision.

She will live with Mercedes and Wayan and their family in Kuta and will have to report monthly to parole authorities.

Her case drew intense interest in Australia, whose media were focused on Indonesia following the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings and an attack on its embassy in Jakarta in 2004.

Many people questioned the fairness of the trial and the length of her sentence compared to some of those convicted in relation to the Bali bombings.

At least two other Australians are on death row in Indonesian drug smuggling cases, and several are serving long prison terms.
