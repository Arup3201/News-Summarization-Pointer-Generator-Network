The head of the US army has admitted that he is ‘very concerned’ about cuts to Britain’s defence spending.

General Raymond Odierno warned that the cuts could diminish Britain’s ability to fight future campaigns.

He also called on the Government to maintain defence spending at the Nato target of two per cent of national income.

Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns 

General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America’s confidence in their military ally.

I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,’ he told The Daily Telegraph. ‘We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do.

‘What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.’

His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain’s Armed Forces would be ‘unwise’ with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism.

Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP

In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to ‘tackle the really wicked issues’ facing the world.

And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions – further undermining the UK’s global standing.

The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' 

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment.

'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.'

His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds.

'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of GDP for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence, I think a lot of Conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating,' he told the BBC'S Andrew Neil.

'What is happening at the moment with, for example, Putin's Russia, is really only one miscalculation away from creating an Article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the European continent.'

He was referring to the NATO article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28.

Dr Fox added the relationship between Britain and America had been compromised following Parliament's voting against intervening in Syria following the regime's reported use of chemical weapons.

'I think there was damage done to Britain's relationship with the US at least to an extent when Parliament voted not to take action over the Syrian use of chemical weapons.

During a recent visit to Washington Mr Cameron was told by President Barack Obama that reducing Britain's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty

'I think there's a real danger here which is (that) you shouldn't make threats which you're not willing to follow through on.

'If you draw red lines, as President Obama did, and don't follow them through, that only gives comfort to your enemies.'

David Cameron was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in Wales last year.

However recent reports revealed the Government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent.

President Obama last month insisted Britain live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening NATO.

During a visit to Washington he told David Cameron that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty.

Only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past. They are the US, Britain, Estonia and Greece.
