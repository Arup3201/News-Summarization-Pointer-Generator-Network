Phil Taylor, the 16-time world champion,  avoided a giant-killing by the giant Dutchman Vincent van der Voort on Friday night to reach the 20th world semi-final of his illustrious career.

The 54-year-old believes this is his last realistic opportunity to lift the Sid Waddell trophy. And he remains on track with that target, moving into the semi-finals of the William Hill World Darts Championship with a 5-3 victory at Alexandra Palace.

From the Power's perspective, though, this was an edgy and nervous win against a 6ft 5in opponent who has been struggling with a severe back problem. Taylor, who won his first world crown, albeit the BDO version, nearly 25 years ago, appreciated afterwards that he came close to being toppled, especially as Van der Voort led 3-2 in sets after being 2-0 down.

Phil Taylor reacts after winning the sixth set of his match with Vincent van der Voort on Friday night 

Dutchman Van der Voort had been suffering with back problems but said he gave the match all he could

Taylor, 5ft 8in, said: 'That match was all about survival. Vincent was in agony with his back. I tried to extend the game as long as I could. He was in trouble and yet he was still hitting his scores and 180s. I need to rest now because I' m shattered.'

Taylor, as he has done so often in the past, asserted his authority on this match in the opening stages. When Van der Voort missed the bullseye on a 126 finish in the fifth leg of the first set, Taylor punished him with an 87 checkout. His average of 107.82 after five legs gave the impression he was in the mood for an early finish. It was a similar story in the second set as, after Van der Vort missed three darts for 16, Taylor nailed 80.

Yet the 39-year-old Dutchman refused to lie down and reacted by winning three successive sets in a row, taking nine of out 11 legs. In the fourth set, Van der Voort knocked off 113 and 107, both on a double 20 finish; in the fifth, he took out 100 and 104 against Taylor's throw and enjoyed a three-dart set average of 120.61.

However, the sixth set end up being a pivotal one in terms of the narrative of this match. Had Taylor lost, he would have gone 4-2 behind.

Instead the relieved Stoke thrower won it to draw level at 3-3 apiece – but he only sealed the leveller with his 21st dart and surprisingly after missing eight darts at the double. Little wonder that he celebrated by sticking his index finger to his temple and mouthing to the crowd the words: 'This is doing my head in – I need bloody shooting!'

The pressure on his shoulders eased in the seventh set as he won it against the throw. And the eighth set was a mere formality as he booked yet another semi-final appearance.

Van der Voort said: 'I gave it everything I had. It just wasn't good enough. I don't want to use my back as an excuse. I lost to the better player.'

Taylor will face Raymond van Barneveld who overcame reigning BDO world champion Stephen Bunting in a 5-4 thriller.

The two men matched each other almost all the way, but Van Barneveld broke the game in his favour with a 124 checkout to go two-up midway through the final set.

'I needed extra eyes in set five because I couldn't see, it was all blurred,' the Dutchman said before taking the microphone and turning to the crowd to praise his opponent.

'This man here, he won everything in the BDO and then he said I will come over, I want to play with the best of the best and he is one of the best.

'Stephen, you are a world class player.'
