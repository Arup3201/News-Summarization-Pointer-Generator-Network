One in four voters backing another party might support Labour if Ed Miliband was replaced as leader, a poll has found.

In a nationwide Opinium poll for the Daily Mail, 25 per cent of those who had already decided to vote for another party at the general election next May said ditching him could swing their vote.

The poll will pile pressure on Labour, who face being pushed into second place by Ukip in next week’s European elections.

Liability: According to a poll, many voters are put off voting Labour because of Ed Miliband

Only 8 per cent of the more than 2,000 people surveyed this week said they would be less likely to vote Labour if Mr Miliband were no longer in charge.

Mr Miliband was asked on Channel 4 News last night: ‘Why are you doing so badly?’ He floundered, finally saying: ‘Let’s see what happens. I don’t accept [that]’.

Labour fell below the Conservatives in two opinion polls this week for the first time in two years, although yesterday they regained a three-point lead.

Surveys show most voters back Labour’s message on lowering the cost of living, but do not see Mr Miliband as prime minister.

Typo: Election guru David Axelrod, right, failed to spell his boss's name correctly on Twitter

On current predictions, Labour is still set to emerge as the largest party in 2015. The quirks of the system mean the Tories need a 6 per cent lead for a majority.

Embarrassingly, Mr Miliband’s election guru David Axelrod, who is on a six-figure salary, got his boss’s name wrong on Twitter yesterday.

The US strategist spelled Miliband with two l’s, inadvertently linking to a spoof account mocking the leader.
