It may be the middle of winter, but these images show that at least one garden in the UK is bursting with life.

While most flower patches across the nation lie bare, Abbey Garden on the Isles of Scilly can boast of having 255 different species of flower in bloom.

The New Year flower count, which was completed by Abbey Garden’s head gardener, Andrew Lawson, curator Mike Nelhams and garden students, is an annual island tradition that has been taking place for more than 150 years.

Professional garden curators and local people have been called upon to count the number of flowering species and keep track of the diverse plant-life.

The spectacular display of greenery is made possible by the balmy climate of the island of Tresco, just 30 miles from the Cornish coast, and the sheltered design of the gardens themselves.

Built alongside the stately St Nicholas’ Priory, once the home of a 19th Century landowner, the gardens are protected by high walls and rows of thick trees and shrubs, which protect the delicate species inside from any rough winds.

The gardens are also south-facing, which, combined the Scilly Isles’ unusually high, means that plants from as far afield as South Africa do not struggle to grow.

Hotter, drier terraces at the top of the garden suit South African and Australian plants, while those lower down provide the humidity that favours flora from New Zealand and South America.

When the winter blooms come, the garden’s exotic aloes, acacias and proteas take centre stage.

Although the gardens have been decimated in previous years by extremely bad weather – such as the Great Storm of 1987 – they are growing once again and this year 25 more species have been found than in the 2013 count.
