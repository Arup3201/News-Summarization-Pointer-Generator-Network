Australia Post is reportedly set to axe 900 jobs within days after its flagging letters business potentially faces billions of dollars in losses.

One of Australia's oldest companies, founded in 1809, is forecast to go heavily into the red if it continues to offer its failing letter delivery service, Farifax Media reports. Â 

Its 32,000 staff are expected to be informed of the cuts as early as Tuesday, with most positions to go in Sydney and Melbourne.

Major losses: Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour is expected to announce 900 job cuts this week

Fairfax says everyday home delivery of standard-priced mail is expected to be another casualty, with the service to be cut back to two or three times a week providing approval can be sought to change government regulations.

'Australia Post has made it very clear that it is confronting dramatic change due to the impact of declining revenues in our letters service,' an Australia Post spokeswoman told MailOnline.

'Our Managing Director and CEO Ahmed Fahour has publicly stated that the losses in letters business have already overwhelmed the profits in parcels and without reform, the letters services will lose over $1 billion annually in a few years.'

Posties could lose their jobs: Private modelling indicates Australia Post will lose $7.1 billion through to 2022-23 if the business continues on its present

The spokeswoman added: 'Australia Post is already responding and is a much leaner organisation than it was three years ago.

'Part of the modernisation of Australia Post involves shifting resources and investing in areas in response to customer needs, such as recent announcements around the extension of Express Post services and parcel delivery to Saturdays and extended weekend trading hours.'

'We will not be commenting further until the impact of these and other changes we need to make are communicated to our staff, who of course remain our top priority,' she said.

Fairfax papers says private modelling indicates Australia Post will lose $7.1 billion through to 2022-23 if the business continues on its present path.

Ahmed Fahour was appointed MD and CEO of Australia Post in February 2010. In May of that year, he announced a new strategy that was designed to bring the company into the future.

It included a new organisation structure and a foray into digital businesses.

However, last year things began to look worse for the company as it was announced external recruitment had been frozen.

Mr Fahour has been fairly open with the government about the impending financial problems for the postal service, which reaches more than 10 million Australian addresses, operates 6,990 postal outlets, and serves more than a million customers in postal outlets every business day.

The company's three core areas are letters and associated services, retail merchandise and agency services, and parcels and logistics.

Falling behind: Australia Post's letters service lost $218 million in 2013

In Australia Post's annual report last year, released in October, Mr Fahour announced a steady 14 per cent rise in revenue to $5.8 billion.

But the actual letters part of the business lost $218 million in 2013.

While there may not be much money left in delivering letters these days, other parts of the postal service are booming.

Its unregulated packages business made $648 million. This was in part because the company has an advantage in the package business world over competitors like DHL - it can use the entire Australia Post network, including some 4400 retail outlets - with 2651 situated in rural areas - and the huge network of posties.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said earlier this year that there were no plans to sell Australia Post.

The news that the service could axe 900 jobs in the next few days, is in bitter contrast to Mr Fahour's current pay packet.

Despite working for a public utility, he was paid a whopping $4.8 million in 2013.

His earnings were higher than the bosses of some of Australia's biggest companies, including Woolworths, Woodside Petroleum, David Jones and JB Hi-Fi.

He received a pay increase of 66 per cent, while his workers received a meager 1.5 per cent pay rise in 2013.
