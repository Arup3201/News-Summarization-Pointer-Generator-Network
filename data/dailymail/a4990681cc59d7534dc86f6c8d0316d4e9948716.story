Just what is a woman to do when they've secured a table at the hottest restaurant in the world for their 39th birthday, but don't have anyone to take?

If you're mobile tech entrepenuer Stephanie Robesky and the restaurant in question is Noma's Tokyo pop-up, the answer is to take the search to your blog.

Ms Robesky is one of the lucky few to get a table during the usually Copenhagen-based eateries five-week stint in the Japanese capital, which ends on Valentine's Day. 

But Ms Robesky, from San Francisco, is dateless - so she has advertised the second seat at her table-for-two.

Unsurprisingly when 6,000 scrabbled to get a reservation, Ms Robeksy has been inundated with offers.

Stephanie Robesky was among the lucky few to get a table at Nobu's Tokyo pop-up - but doesn't have a date for the sought-after meal

So Ms Robesky has advertised for a fellow food enthusiast to join her for the meal, which falls on her 39th birthday

Writing on her blog, Nerd Girl, she explained: 'Yes, there were 60,000 people who tried to get this reservation and I am lucky enough to have secured one for two. 

'And, sadly, I don’t have a dining companion. 

'So I decided since I’m single and dateless on what will be my 39th birthday that I would open up the opportunity for someone to take advantage of this crazy, once in a lifetime meal and find myself a date.' 

Indeed, each sitting at the restaurant has just 44 spaces for diners, meaning seats are at a premium. 

And it seems even head chef René Redzepi knows how sought-after they are: he gave Ms Robesky's hunt a boost when he tweeted out her appeal from his official Twitter account.

But the opportunity is not open to just anyone. Ms Robesky, who lists her likes as travelling, good food, 'nerding out' on gadgets and hanging out with bald cats, among other things, has set out a strict criteria which a potential date must meet.

Writing on her blog, she stipulated eight must-haves for anyone applying - including being single, living in the Bay Area of San Francisco, and know how to use a knife and fork 'properly'.  

'Knowledge of Japanese etiquette a big plus,' she added. 

The date will also have to be able to cover their own flight and accommodation costs. 

However, the 38-year-old will pay for dinner and wine pairing for the meal, which is to take place in the last week of January.

But even with the strict rules, and with flights boasting a price tag of somewhere around $1,000, Ms Robesky has had so many applications she has had to extend the opening date.

'I didn’t think that this was going to go as crazy as it has,' she wrote in an update on January 13. 

'I am honestly humbled by this entire experience and I haven’t even gotten to the grand finale!'

She added: 'There are so many awesome guys out there that it is going to be really difficult to pick just one.'

The lucky winner will be selected after she meets up with three of the potential dinner dates on January 17.

But whether or not the world will ever discover who Ms Robesky's dining companion was is unclear. She has left that decision up to him. 

Danish Chef Rene Redzepi, who won the title World's Best Restaurant with Noma two years in a row, has moved to Japan for a five week stint in Tokyo

Foodies across the planet have been raving about Noma for  years - with more than one dubbing it 'the world's best restaurant'.

The restaurant, which is based in Copenhagen, serves Nordic food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef René Redzepi. 

Noma's website boasts it is 'hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future' through its food.

Diners are offered a 20-course menu, including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants, radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms. 

A meal at the two Michelin-starred restaurant costs around about £166, with wine pairing costing an extra £104.

But it is worth it, according to the restaurant critics.

Writing for the Daily Mail in 2010, Tom Parker Bowles concluded: 'Noma is utterly and gloriously unique. And quite, quite brilliant.' 

The Tokyo pop-up is the first time Redzepi and his team have ventured outside Denmark.

It opened last Friday, and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east.
