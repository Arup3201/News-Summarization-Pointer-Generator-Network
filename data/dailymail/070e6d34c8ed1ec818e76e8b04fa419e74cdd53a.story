A nurse who pinned a golliwog doll to her uniform to mock black colleagues went on to draft a council’s policy on race relations, a hearing was told.

Susan Horton branded a junior nurse a ‘gorilla’, joked about feeding them bananas and made monkey noises while discussing a black doctor.

She was sacked along with her colleague Sarah Cullum when their two-year reign of terror at St Mary’s Hospital in Kettering, Northamptonshire, was exposed.

Guilty: Nurse Susan Horton (left) clipped a golliwog doll (right, file picture) to her uniform as she made a series of racist remarks about her black colleagues, a misconduct hearing was told

But in a bizarre twist, a Nursing and 
Midwifery Council hearing was told yesterday that after she was fired by
the NHS in 2007, Horton was hired by Wellingborough Council as a 
community safety officer.

‘During her time at the council, Susan
wrote a policy on race hate and delivered a talk on that to 300 
employees at the council,’ said John Lynch, representing Horton.

'Terrible behaviour': Horton's colleague Sarah Cullum (pictured) was also found guilty after the hearing was told she referred to one ward as the 'United Nations' because 'they are all black'

Last night Horton and Cullum were kicked out of the nursing profession after being found guilty of more than 60 charges.

Richard Williams, of the NMC, said: 
‘There was physical abuse of patients and use of inappropriate language 
when referring to patients both in front of them and behind their 
backs.’

The tribunal was told Horton and Cullum acted in ‘partnership’ to racially abuse staff at all levels, including senior doctors.

They were also responsible for physically abusing some patients, including a 70-year-old man who was hit and kicked by Horton.

Both nurses shouted at another 
patient, said he smelled of urine and asked if he was gay and if he 
liked sharing a room with men. Healthcare assistant Sandy Smith said 
Horton and Cullum swapped racist remarks when they met for shift 
handovers.

She said Horton’s golliwog was on her 
uniform ‘so it was always accessible’ and that she often pointed at it 
and then at black nurses.

Horton made monkey noises while 
discussing a black doctor, referred to her as ‘scary Mary’ and said she 
‘shouldn’t be allowed to breed’.

She also joked about ‘saving the bananas for Mary’.

Both nurses commented that two nurses 
from Guyana were ‘jabbering away in their gobbledegook’ as they spoke in
their native language.

The tribunal panel was told Horton did
monkey impressions while discussing a black doctor and referred to 
black colleagues as ‘n*****s’ that ‘look like apes’.

Giving evidence, Horton had 
strenuously denied making racist comments and described the golliwog 
doll she wore as ‘lovely’. Cullum’s lawyer, Sarah Christie-Brown, said 
she was ‘sucked in’ by behaviour on the ward which had become a ‘way of 
life’.

A spokesman for Northamptonshire 
Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘This behaviour discredits 
professional nursing and we know they do not reflect the views of other 
nurses in the trust.’
