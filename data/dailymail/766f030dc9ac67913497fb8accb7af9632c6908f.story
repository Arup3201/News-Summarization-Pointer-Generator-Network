A 15-year-old boy is accused of using an assault rifle to kill his pastor father and other family members in their home last night, police have said.

The suspect, who was identified as Nehemiah Griego, was arrested shortly after the shooting at the Albuquerque, New Mexico, home.

Inside, police found the five victims - a man, woman, two girls and a boy - who were each shot multiple times.

Killing: Five people were shot to death at the home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the Saturday night shooting

One of the victims was identified as Gregory Griego, the alleged shooter's father who has served as a pastor at the Calvary Albuquerque church.

The church confirmed Mr Griego's death to MailOnline on Sunday.

Information: Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston speaks about the murders during a news conference on Sunday

Including Nehemiah, Mr Griego and his wife Sarah have 10 children.

The names of the other victims could not immediately be determined.

Investigators also were seeking to 
determine who owned several guns that were found at the home, one of 
which was a semi-automatic military-style rifle.

The juvenile suspect was charged this morning with two counts of murder, and three counts of child abuse resulting in death, according to the station.

Each victim was shot multiple times, authorities said.

Authorities would not reveal any details of their talks with the alleged gunman.

The
tragedy comes just over a month after gunman Adam Lanza slaughtered 20
schoolchildren and seven women - including his own mother - in Newtown,
Connecticut.

Lanza, who killed himself as police closed in on him, was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle.

The massacre ignited a fiery debate on gun control and resulted in President Obama's push last week to ban assault weapons and intensify background checks on those purchasing guns.
