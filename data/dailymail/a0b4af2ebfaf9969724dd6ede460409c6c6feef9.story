Monica Lewinsky’s clothing has gained national attention in the past- with her semen-stained blue dress playing a role in the Clinton sex scandal- but now it is her lingerie that is up for sale.

A collection of her old clothes, handwritten notes, and gifts signed pictures of former President Clinton are now up for sale for thousands of dollars.

Before she became notorious for her sexual relationship with President Clinton, Lewinsky also had an affair with her married former high school drama teacher Andy Bleiler.

The whole lot: A collection of letters, cards and gifts that Lewinsky gave her high school drama teacher, who she had a five-year affair with during the time when she had a sexual relationship with President Clinton

Mr Bleiler gained momentary international recognition during the investigation into Lewinsky's affair with President Clinton, as he came forward and told about their lengthy affair.

Though it is unclear when or how his marriage to then-wife Kathy ended, the two have since split and for some reason, Kathy ended up with a collection of clothes and gifts that the couple got from Monica over the years.

All of these items were included as part of the evidence gathered by Kenneth Starr, the independent counselor pursuing the impeachment charges over the affair.

Mr Bleiler's ex-wife, who now goes by Kate Nason, handed the lot over to an unidentified third party, who has since put the goods up for auction.

Personalized photos: As a staffer, Lewinsky would have been able to have arranged a photo with a friend's name that was then signed by the autopen of the President's signature

Side spotlight: Andy Bleiler, Monica Lewinsky's former high school drama teacher who had a five-year affair with his former student alongside his then-wife

'Monica was friends with the couple, 
so I think she gave some of her clothes to Kathy, just to wear they may 
have exchanged some of the clothes,' Laura Yntema, an auction manager at
 Nate D. Sanders, told MailOnline.

Included
 are eight pieces of clothing that was ‘gifted to Kate Bleiber’ 
including a sheer floor-length negligee. Lewinsky’s weight has been the 
subject of ridicule in the past, and the clothes that she gave the 
Bleilers are all sizes large and extra-large.

The infamous blue dress is not included in the group of items up for sale.

Lookbook: A number of jackets that Monica gave to Bleiler's wife- all of which were size L or XL

While her old baggy jackets may not seem 
directly related to the presidential affair, there are a number of other
 gifts and items that Lewinsky gave her former teacher from her time 
working as a White House intern.

Weight struggles: Monica appears to have given some of the clothes to Bleiler's now-ex wife

There are two auto-pen signed photos of Mr Clinton- and one with him alongside Hillary- that Monica sent to Mr Bleiler.

In her role as a White House staffer, 
it would not have been unusual for her to submit a request for a 
personalized photo to be signed in the style of the president.

She
 also arranged for the president to write a birthday note to Bleiler, 
who Monica carried on a five-year affair with including some time when 
her relationship with the two men overlapped.

‘Dear
 Andy: Hillary and I want to personally extend our warmest wishes to you
 as you gather with your family and friends to celebrate your birthday. 
As you look forward to the year ahead, please accept our best wishes for
 good health and much happiness. Happy Birthday!’ the typed note from 
Clinton wrote.

All of that correspondence would likely have gone through the proper channels at the White House- and were not a result of the sexual relationship with the president- given that they were composed on official letterhead.

She also gifted a pack of White House matches and boxes of M&Ms with the seal of the president.

The lot is being sold by Nate D. Sanders, a memorabilia collector, and has received one bid of $2,500 so far. The sale will close in three days time.

Ms Yntema told MailOnline that the auction house expects the final sale of the lot to be anywhere between $250,000 and $500,000.

'Most of the bidding happens on the last day,' she said.
