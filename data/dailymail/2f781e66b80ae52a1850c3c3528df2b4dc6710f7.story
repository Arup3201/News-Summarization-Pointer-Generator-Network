'Hacktivist' group Anonymous and splinter groups associated with it have begun unleashing havoc around the world in a new wave of anti-piracy protests.

Protests and website attacks have been seen across Europe from groups opposing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which many believe could lead to 'censorship of the internet'.

The UK is among a host of European Union nations to have signed up to the controversial agreement, along with France, Spain, Ireland and Italy.

Those opposed to the ACTA believe it could lead to authorities blocking content on the internet.

Support in Poland for ACTA has sparked protests from the 'hacktivist' group Anonymous, who attacked several Polish government websites, leaving them unreachable for several days.

Street protests of hundreds, and in some cases thousands of people, have also broken out across Poland for the past three days.

In the Czech Republic, a local group aligning itself with Anonymous attacked the website of a group that supports ACTA. The group collects money for music production and distributes it to artists.

A Twitter account called Anonymous Sweden claimed responsibility for the attack. It said in a tweet that the attack was carried out in protest against planned new copyright legislation in Ireland.

Meanwhile, some 29,000 signatories have backed an online petition against plans to allow music publishers to take internet service providers to court to protect their material from file-sharing and online piracy.

Protesters opposed to the new legislation also believe it could place excessive constraints on file-sharing and violate consumer rights.

ACTA is a far-reaching agreement that aims to harmonize international standards on protecting the rights of those who produce music, movies, pharmaceuticals, fashion, and a range of other products that often fall victim to intellectual property theft.

ACTA also takes aim at the online piracy of movies and music; those opposed to it fear that it will also lead authorities to block content on the Internet.

A prominent Polish rock start, Zbigniew Holdys, has come out in support of ACTA, accusing the Internet activists - mostly young people - of profiting from pirated material online and trying to hold onto that practice.

ACTA shares some similarities with the hotly debated Stop Online Piracy Act in the U.S., which was shelved by lawmakers last week after Wikipedia and Google blacked out or partially obscured their websites for a day in protest.

Polandâ€™s ambassador to Japan, Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska, signed it in Tokyo. Speaking on Polish television, she said that Poland was one of several European Union countries to sign ACTA Thursday, including Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Greece.

Several other industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada and South Korea, signed the agreement last year.
