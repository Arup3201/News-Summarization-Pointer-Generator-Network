Team Sky rider Richie Porte reeled in a 36-second gap to win the Paris-Nice title for the second time in three years.

The Australian was well placed but still significantly behind Tony Gallopin heading into the final day, but while Porte surged the overnight leader fell away on the Col d'Eze time-trial.

Porte, 30, clocked 20 minutes 23 seconds for the 9.5 kilometre climb, 13 seconds quicker than nearest challenger Simon Spilak.

With Gallopin's challenge expiring, Michal Kwiatowski finished second overall and third on the day.

Welshman Geraint Thomas, one of Porte's Team Sky colleagues, was seventh fastest in the time-trial to claim fifth place in front of Gallopin.

Porte said: 'It means a lot to me to be a two-time winner of an iconic race like Paris-Nice, and this one feels even sweeter than the last one because it was so hard. 

The Australian dominated the stage seven time-trial to steal the title from Tony Gallopin on the final day

'They threw everything at us on Saturday, and to win on the top of the Col d'Eze this year, like I did in 2013, is incredible.

'I was a little bit nervous going into the day. Geraint and I threw time away yesterday (Saturday) - we were in a fantastic position, and for both of us to crash like we did wasn't ideal. To win today though, is a fantastic feeling.'
