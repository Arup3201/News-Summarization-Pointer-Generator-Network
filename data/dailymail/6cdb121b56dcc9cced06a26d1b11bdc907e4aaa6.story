Smile: Harry Redknapp arriving at court yesterday

His full name was Henry James Redknapp but everyone in court knew him as ’Arry.

He made a final adjustment to his dark blue suit and put one hand on each side of the witness box.

Then, for more than two hours, the man tipped as the next England football manager took centre stage in a tax-evasion trial upon which his proud reputation is staked.

It began as the Harry Redknapp show – a testimony delivered in high-speed Cockney, punctuated by laughter and one-liners.

Among them was the claim that he had been too busy ‘thinking about who was marking David Beckham’ in his Portsmouth team’s match against Manchester United to pay attention to a form he signed transferring money into his Monaco account in 2003.

But the mood turned sour when he accused a police officer of staring at him in court – and clashed with a prosecution lawyer in heated exchanges under cross-examination.

Just two minutes of the Spurs and former Portsmouth supremo’s evidence at Southwark Crown Court had elapsed before he cut through the legal niceties to tell the jury: ‘I’ve always paid my tax. I’d rather pay too much tax than too little.’

And no, he insisted, the 100,000 dollars his friend and former chairman Milan Mandaric set up for him in an offshore account in Monaco was certainly not a bung.

This was the first time East London-born Redknapp, 64, had the opportunity to explain in person to a jury why he is not guilty of trying to cheat the public purse by avoiding tax on the money.

He told of how he became employed at Portsmouth by Mandaric after leaving West Ham in 2001.

'Paid too much': Harry Redknapp, seen leaving Southwark Crown Court, said he hired the best people to make sure he paid his taxes correctly

It was a meeting over a cup of tea in a 
hotel in the New Forest which secured him a job he loved; a contract 
eventually worth a total of £4.3million; and eventually a place in the 
dock next to the billionaire businessman who became his friend, 
benefactor and co-accused.

The offshore ‘investment’ Mandaric made for Redknapp is at the centre of the tax evasion charges.

Crown says the money Mandaric paid into the Monaco account was a bonus 
for the £3million profit Portsmouth reaped from selling striker Peter 
Crouch for £4million, and that tax should therefore have been paid in 
the UK.

Under a 
previous contract, Redknapp would have been paid 10 per cent of the 
transfer fee for Crouch’s sale. But the contract had recently been 
revamped to give Redknapp higher wages and bonuses but 5 per cent of the
transfer fee.

Redknapp
was ‘not a happy bunny’ afterwards, he agreed. The Crown says the 
Monaco money was to compensate his loss – a claim which both men deny.

Redknapp agreed yesterday he had travelled to Monaco with his wife Sandra to set up the account.

Much of his time was taken up by a bank official talking about Fulham Football Club, he said.

He
declined the bank’s offer of taking the paperwork away with him, he 
said, telling the jury: ‘It would have been a waste of time giving me a 
load of forms.

'I would probably have left them on the deckchair when me and Sandra went to the beach in the afternoon.’

Fans
of Redknapp queued for seats in a packed public gallery yesterday as he
gave evidence a few yards from the gaze of his football pundit son 
Jamie.

One spectator denied a seat peered through binoculars from outside. 

Inside,
the man himself provoked laughter from lawyers, jurors and the Press as
he answered questions from his barrister John Kelsey-Fry, QC.

But
the mood changed when he pointed to Detective Inspector David Manley in
the well of the court and barked: ‘Mr Manley, would you stop staring at
me? I know you are trying to cause me a problem.’

Redknapp then turned to Judge Anthony Leonard and apologised.

Under
cross-examination by prosecution QC John Black, he again appeared to 
lose his temper when asked if he knew how much money Mandaric had paid 
into the Monaco account, named Rosie 47 after Redknapp’s dog and his 
year of birth.

Redknapp
insisted he had ‘no idea, not a clue’ about what had gone into or out 
of the account, and hadn’t asked Mandaric about it.

Mr
Black then pointed out Redknapp had told the Quest Investigation into 
football corruption in November 2006 that he thought there was about 
£120,000 in it.

Redknapp said: ‘I can’t remember where I got that figure.’ He pointed out the figure was incorrect.

Redknapp
also said Sandra, his wife of 44 years, was terrified when police set 
off the burglar alarm in an early-hours raid at the couple’s luxury home
at Sandbanks, Dorset, in 2007, while he was away watching a match in 
Germany.

He said: ‘My wife thought I had probably been killed in a plane crash.’

Both Redknapp and Mandaric deny two charges of cheating the public purse.

The trial continues.
