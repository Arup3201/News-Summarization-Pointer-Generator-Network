A student accused of funding terrorism in Syria walked free from court yesterday after she was cleared of trying to smuggle cash out of the UK in her knickers.

University student Nawal Msaad, 27, was caught with £16,000 in euros stuffed in her underwear at Heathrow as she attempted to board a flight to Istanbul.

Police believed she was due to hand the cash over to a jihadi. But after a month-long trial, a jury decided that Miss Msaad was tricked into being a mule by an old school friend.

Amal Elwahabi, 27, told Miss Msaad the money was for a house deposit, when it was in face destined for her husband Aine Davis who is thought to be fighting for ISIS in Syria

Amal 
El-Wahabi, who gave her the money, was convicted of fundraising for 
terrorism in Syria where her husband, a Muslim convert, was fighting 
with Islamic insurgents. Wahabi, 27, is the first Briton to be convicted
 under terror laws of funding jihadis.

Miss
 Msaad, whose model looks have earned her the nickname ‘jihottie’ on 
social media sites, wept as she was cleared. The London Metropolitan 
University human resources management undergraduate appeared during the 
trial to be a most unlikely jihadi sympathiser.

Nawal Msaad believed she may have targeted because of her race and religion.

The part-time singer and student was held on remand for more than a month after her arrest, but maintained her innocence throughout.

Posting on Facebook shortly after her release on bail, she wrote: 'I can't help but wonder if I had been called Natalie from Surrey whether the authorities would have pressed terrorism charges against me.

'I'd urge that we do not lose sight and go after British Muslims where the delicacy of the political climate means very little is needed to detain someone and charge them.'

She added: 'Anyone out there who knows me will know I do not have any extremist views or support terrorism nor do I have any jihadist affiliations.

'I hate terrorism - I am a British Muslim and they make religion not look peaceful.

'We can all understand the importance of security within the current climate, however we need to be careful that we don't breed racial hatred as that is exactly what terrorists would want - to create divisions.'

Attending
 the Old Bailey dressed in tight-fitting shirts, high heels, pink 
lipstick and thigh-skimming skirts, the glamorous brunette appeared to 
relish the limelight.

She posted regular updates on social media of what
 she was wearing to court.

Other images on her profile showed her 
modelling jewellery and wearing short black dresses for nights out.

During
 her trial, she was seen flirting with a defendant in another case, 
provoking a reprimand from a judge after the besotted man was seen 
waving at her in court.

Described
 by those close to her as being ‘attracted like a moth to the flame of 
publicity’, the would-be singer from Holloway, North London, posted a 
video on YouTube, professionally recorded in a studio weeks before her 
trial, of her performing a Jennifer Lopez song.

Yesterday
 she said: ‘The last eight months have been surreal, now I just want to 
get my life back. I’m physically and mentally drained.’

Miss Msaad, born
 in London to Moroccan parents, accused police of targeting her because 
she was a British Muslim.

‘Anyone
 out there who knows me will know I do not have any extremist views or 
support terrorism nor do I have any jihadist affiliations,’ she said.

‘I
 can’t help but wonder if I had been called Natalie from Surrey whether 
the authorities would have pressed terrorism charges against me.’

Miss
 Msaad met Wahabi, who is also of Moroccan descent, when they were 
pupils at Holland Park School in West London and the pair remained 
close.

She told jurors she was ‘stitched up’ by her friend who promised 
her £790 to take the 20,000 euros to Turkey in January.

Wahabi told her the cash, in 500-euro notes, was to pay a deposit on a house in Turkey and fund a beauty therapy business there.

Extremist: The cash was for El-Wahabi's husband Aine Davis, a convicted drug dealer and Muslim-convert believed to be fighting with ISIS forces in Syria

Posed up: El Wahabi wanted the cash for her husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria

But
 in reality, the hairdresser was preparing to join her 30-year-old 
drug-dealing husband Aine Davis on his terrorist crusade, taking their 
two infant sons with her.

Wahabi,
 was described by her own barrister as a ‘foul-mouthed, phone addicted, 
weed-smoking kaffir’ collapsed, screaming, ‘No, I can’t breathe’ as she 
was convicted of funding terrorism.

She claimed she thought her husband, whom she met at a West London mosque when she was 19, was helping an aid convoy in Syria.

But
 police found extremist videos sent by Davis, a former Tube driver with 
drug and firearm convictions.

Friends: Miss Msaad agreed to take the cash for her friend El-Wahabi but had believed that it was a deposit for a property in Turkey

Anger: Nawal Msaad, pictured leaning on a car, believed she may have targeted because of her race and religion and was held for a month in custody after he arrest

Outraged: After she was cleared Miss Msaad, left and right, said she should never have been charged

He also sent a message featuring the flag 
of terrorist group ISIS, with the slogan: ‘Allah prefers the Mujahadeen 
over those who remain behind.’ Wahabi responded: ‘Be beside you until 
the day you die.’

Police
 found photographs on Wahabi’s phone of Davis posing with an AK-47 along
 with other fighters. She sent him a picture of their son in a jihadi 
headscarf.

Wahabi
 will be sentenced on September 12.

Judge Nicholas Hilliard warned she 
faces jail, saying: ‘A substantial amount of money was destined straight
 for the hands of a dangerous extremists engaged in violent jihad with 
all the terror and misery that causes.’

Nawal Msaad has arrived at the Old Bailey over the past four weeks for her trial in a variety of outfits - most of which have been teamed with a police ankle tag.

The 27-year-old was photographed walking into court on July 8 in a tweed skirt and a tight white blouse with moccasin-style pumps, which clearly showed off her tag.

And on August 4 she came with a fitted pink dress with a peplum, and a skinny black belt.

Caught
 up: Miss Msaad was stopped by officials who removed 38 500-euro 
notes, four 200-euro notes and two 100-euro notes from her underwear. She is pictured (from left) on August 7, August 8 and August 12

Two days later on August 6, she wore a
 Ralph Lauren cricket-style jumper with grey skinny jeans, a white shirt
 and a large necklace with white stilettos. All three of these outfits 
showed off her tag.

She was 
then photographed on August 7 with a chiffon skirt, a polka-dot sleeveless 
blouse, and a chain-strap bag with white stilettos.

A
 police tag was clearly visible on her right ankle - but the next day, 
she arrived wearing a white blouse with pale pink trousers that covered 
the tag, and cream stilettos.

By
 yesterday she approached the court in another outfit consisting of 
graphic-print top and short suit - which this time showed off her tag. 
She also carried the same bag but wore black heels.

Tracking system: Despite being cleared of any wrongdoing she still had her ankle tagged as she walked free

While
 on those six occasions she arrived wearing sunglasses, these were gone 
as she exited today - wearing a tight-fitting black top and high-waisted
 striped sailor-style shorts with flip-flops.

And despite being cleared of any wrongdoing earlier, the ankle tag was still visible on her right leg.

But
 there was no sign during her court appearances of any accessories on 
the tag - despite her placing a Chanel logo on top of it for a music 
video in which she featured in June (see below).

A video of Miss Msaad singing Jennifer Lopez's song 'Same Girl' was posted on YouTube on June 21, in order to protest her innocence following her release from prison on bail.

The lyrics of the song tell a story that she was 'same girl' who had been let down by 'fake friends'. Miss Msaad's ankle tag - complete with Chanel logo - is clearly visible in parts of the video.
