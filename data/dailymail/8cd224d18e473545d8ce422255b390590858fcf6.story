Growing confidence about the economy is encouraging families to splash out on big ticket items like cars and holidays, new figures showed today.

Analysis of family finances in 2013 reveals a sharp rise in weekly spending to £517.30, the highest in real terms for four years.

While housing costs and domestic bills make up the biggest slice of weekly outgoings, the Office for National Statistics said Britons are now more willing to make expensive purchases which they put off during the downturn.

Housing and transport costs make up the biggest slices of weekly spending, but recreation and culture have held up despite the recession

Average weekly spending in 2013 was £517.30, the highest since 2010 when inflation is taken into account

The average weekly household expenditure last year was £517.30, up from £501 in 2012 in real terms.

But in 2013 prices, families were spending £547.10 every week in 2004-05, before the recession hit.

There are signs that people are now more willing to spend money on large items which they might have delayed buying in the wake of the financial crash.

‘The economy has witnessed signs of economic recovery, despite consumers remaining price conscious,’ the ONS said.

‘There is evidence that consumer confidence is increasing slowly; increases in household expenditure are largely focused on items such as housing.

‘However, the results have also seen an increase in expenditure on big ticket items, such as new cars in 2013, indicating that pent up demand is being realised.’

Around 14 per cent of spending - £74.70 – went on housing, fuel and electricity costs, excluding mortgages.

The next biggest outlay was transport, coming to £70.40 a week. This includes petrol, diesel and bus and rail fares, but also covers the cost of buying new cars.

On average families spent £8.30 each week on the cost of buying new cars and vans and £12 a week on second hand vehicles.

More than a third of the spending is on loans or higher purchase deals, suggesting families are choosing to buy a new car now and pay it off over several years.

The ONS said: ‘Higher average household expenditure on transport between 2012 and 2013 can partly be attributed to increased purchase of new cars. Vehicle purchases were recorded as being at a six-year high with 1,074,622 new private cars registered.

‘Purchasing new cars is an area where households could moderate or defer expenditure, which may lead to demand building up over time.

‘This is sometimes referred to as “pent up demand”. This may have fuelled the increase in sales of new cars seen in 2013, with consumers replacing vehicles they kept hold of through the recent downturn.’

Despite families feeling the pinch, spending on recreation and culture has held up and actually increased between 2001-02 and 2013, from £53.80 (adjusted for inflation) to £63.90 on average per week.

It covers everything from the cost of cinema and sports tickets, to computers, TVs, games, gardening, and package holidays.

It suggests that even at a time of concern about the economy, British families have continued to spend on life’s luxuries.

‘A common feature of these products and services is that they would generally be considered to constitute discretionary spending, so it is interesting that these types of expenditures have held up over time,’ the ONS said.

Spending on package holidays abroad accounted for an average of £21.00 per week in 2013, in part as a result of the growing cruise market with number of people taking an ocean cruise continuing to grow by 1.5 per cent in 2013.

‘Expenditure on items such as TV, video, computers and recreational activities has also held up over time, showing the high priority placed on these goods and services by many households, regardless of economic circumstances,’ the ONS said.
