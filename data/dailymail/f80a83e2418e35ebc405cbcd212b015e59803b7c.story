Egypt's military-backed government has stepped down today in a shock move just eight months after seizing power.

Interim prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi announced the resignation of his Cabinet this morning, paving the way for the nation's military chief to leave his defense minister's post to run for president.

El-Beblawi's military-backed government was sworn in on July 16, less than two weeks after Field Marsh Abdel-Fettah el-Sissi, the defense minister, ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi after a year in office.

The government's resignation, 
announced by el-Beblawi in a live TV broadcast, came amid a host of 
strikes, including one by public transport workers and garbage 
collectors.

An acute shortage of cooking gas has also been making front page news the past few days.

It was not immediately clear whether el-Beblawi will stay at the helm of a new government or will step aside for a new prime minister.

El-Beblawi has often been derided in the media for his perceived indecisiveness and inability to introduce effective remedies to the country's economic woes.

He has also been criticized for the security forces' inability to prevent high-profile terror attacks blamed on militants sympathetic with Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood.

The outgoing prime minister acknowledged the difficult conditions in which his Cabinet functioned, but suggested that Egypt was in a better place now that it was when he first took office.

'The Cabinet has over the past six or 
seven months shouldered a very difficult and delicate responsibility and
 I believe that, in most cases, it achieved good results,' el-Beblawi 
said.

The goal, he added, was to take Egypt out of a 'narrow tunnel' brought about by security, political and economic pressures.

Commenting on the flurry of strikes, 
the outgoing prime minister cautioned Egyptians that this was not the 
time for making demands.

'We must sacrifice our personal and workers' 
interests for the benefit of the nation,' he said.

A
 presidential bid by the popular el-Sissi has been widely anticipated 
and leaving him out of the next Cabinet will most likely be accompanied 
or soon followed by an announcement by the 59-year-old soldier that he 
is running.

El-Sissi has 
already secured the support of Egypt's top military body, the Supreme 
Council of the Armed Forces, to launch a presidential bid.

Already, the career infantry officer trained in Britain and the United States has been acting in a somewhat presidential manner.

He
 paid a highly publicized visit to Russia earlier this month, when he 
secured the goodwill of the Kremlin and negotiated a large arms deal.

His wife made her first public appearance since el-Sissi's ouster of 
Morsi last week, seated next to him in a military ceremony.
