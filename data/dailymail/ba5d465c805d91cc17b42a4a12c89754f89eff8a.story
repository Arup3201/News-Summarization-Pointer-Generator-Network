Aston Martin has been forced to recall more than 1,600 of its most expensive sports cars after the discovery of an electronic fault that can lead to a dangerous loss of power.

It is the second safety alert affecting the iconic British car-maker this year. In February, nearly 18,000 cars were recalled, including the DBS driven by Daniel Craig in the James Bond movie Quantum Of Solace and a V12 Vantage Roadster that was delivered to his door on his 45th birthday last year.

Now Aston Martin has issued a new safety notice – this time affecting the £133,000 DB9 Coupé, as well as the Volante and the four-door £148,000 Rapide S, which has been described by motoring enthusiasts as the world’s most beautiful four-door sports car.

Iconic: Daniel Craig as James Bond in his DBS in the Quantum of Solace film. The car is among 18,000 recalled by Aston Martin in February 

In February, the firm said a Chinese sub-supplier had been using inferior plastic material in the accelerator pedal arms of models built since late 2007, leading to the weakened substance breaking when the driver increased speed.

This time, safety regulators say the problem is caused by a defective Czech-made circuit board in the transmission control that could lead to a crash because the car is left suddenly powerless when it switches itself into neutral gear.

More than 1,660 vehicles – 313 of them in Britain – will have to be taken off the road while the fault, which came to light only after an owner complained, is repaired.

Paul Hollywood, star of BBC1’s The Great British Bake Off, drives a DB9, the model favoured by many wealthy sports stars and TV celebrities.

A survey by specialist brokers Oracle Finance last year put the DB9, which has a top speed of 186mph and can go from 0 to 62mph in 4.6 seconds, in the top ten list of cars bought by premiership footballers. Mr Hollywood said when he bought his car last year: ‘I’ve been into cars all my life. Aston Martin employs people here, they’re British, they’re Bond, so when I got my DB9 it was a very special day.’

The latest recall affects cars produced in the 12 months to June this year. An Aston Martin spokesman said: ‘It takes only 30 minutes to change the circuit board and the job is done free of charge.

‘We are working with the supplier to rectify the problem.’
