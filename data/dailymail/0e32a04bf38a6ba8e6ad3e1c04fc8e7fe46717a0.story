As a pearly white Pomeranian, Harvey Moon was the shy, nervous type.

But all that changed when he was signed up to a doggie modelling agency and had to be dyed green for a music video.

The transformation was remarkable. He came out of his shell and turned into an attention-seeking bundle of fun.

Colourful personality: Harvey Moon the Pomeranian dog who is only happy when he is dyed

But when the safe vegetable dye wore off he returned to being timid again.

Owner Stephanie Mariam, 19, became convinced the puppy was only happy in bright colours and dyed him blue.

Again Harvey became the life and soul of the party and now he has become a local celebrity in Bournemouth – sporting an array of colours from emerald green to bright purple.

Stephanie said: ‘Once he was dyed again he was back bouncing about so we haven’t looked back. It obviously makes him happy.’

Miss Mariam signed her dog up to modelling agency, Diva Dogs, early this year.

Within a few months, Miss Mariam, a support worker from Dorset, received a phone call inviting Harvey to star in a music video for a band called Roll Deep -  but he had to be dyed green.

After being reassured the vegetable-based dye was safe, the teenager handed her dog over.

With its newly found hair-style, Harvey Moon has become a local celebrity with his colourful locks

With its newly found hair-style, the puppy has become a local celebrity – touring the south coast sporting an array of colours from emerald green to bright purple.

And rather than damage the dog’s soft locks, the dye has improved its condition and it now feels even softer.

Miss Mariam said: ‘He has always been a lovely dog and he has always been very well behaved but he was quite quiet and reserved.

‘But when we dyed him for the video he just came out of his shell.

‘He was a bundle of fun and actually went out his way looking for attention.

‘As the dye washed out he started to get quieter again so it was suggested that I dye him a different colour.

Miss Mariam added: ‘The first thing I loved about Pomeranian’s was that they looked like teddy bears and as I researched them more I liked the sound of their temperament.

‘I fell in love with him as soon as I saw him and thankfully my mum said I was allowed to have him.

‘Harvey is my best friend, he is my baby. I don’t know how to put it any other way because he is the best companion I could ask for.’
