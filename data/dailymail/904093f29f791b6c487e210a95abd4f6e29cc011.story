A banking executive has resigned after his past as an abusive vicar who preyed on young boys was revealed.

Former vicar Stephen Brooks, who was jailed for carrying out 19 sex attacks in Swansea, South Wales, during the 1980s and 1990s, quit his job as a director at Santander after the truth about his abusive background came to light.

The 59-year-old preyed on young boys over a seven-year period while working as a clergyman at St Paul's Church in Sketty and was given a four-year prison sentence in 1994.

Eight of his victims are said to have suffered mental problems and one 38-year-old is said to have attempted suicide and turned to alcohol as a result.

Santander told The Sun they were 'shocked' to learn of his criminal history and confirmed he had quit his role after taking 'immediate steps' to resolve the matter.

Brooks moved to London to get away from the people he had abused and rose to become regional director of education, healthcare and communities at the bank.

He was also given a very public role by the company and even judged the 'responsible small business of the year' award earlier this year.

After being confronted about his past, he said: 'I deeply regret and apologise for the harm that I caused.

'I moved far away from the people I hurt and I have spent 20 years trying to do good and no harm.'

He also insisted that he went through the same vetting procedure as any other employee and received a Criminal Records Bureau check during the consultation process.

A former friend said he had been a charming man, but a 'relentless abuser' who left many victims not wanting to press charges because of fears they may be shunned by the community.

Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas said his appointment posed serious questions about Santander's recruitment process and condemned the company for giving him a public role.

During his case at Swansea Crown Court 19 years ago, Patrick Griffiths, prosecuting, said Brooks was a ‘very well-liked man held in high regard and possessing considerable charisma.'

'His integrity was unquestioned and children found him friendly and approachable’, he added.

Judge Martin Stephens said: 'You were destined for the highest position in the Church but you have caused immense harm and anguish.'
