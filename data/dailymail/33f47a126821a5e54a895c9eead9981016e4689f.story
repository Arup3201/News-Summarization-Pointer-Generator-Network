Boston police are trying to track down a daredevil teenager who was filmed dangerously climbing on top of a speeding subway to clown around on the roof.

The investigation was sparked by a video uploaded to YouTube that was quickly spread on social media this week, showing the thrill-seeking hooligan in action.

The clip depicts the careless young man climbing out of an MBTA train carriage, making his way to roof and performing precarious stunts.

At one point the teen narrowly misses an approaching railway bridge, ducking down underneath it just in time.

All aboard: The thrillseeiking young man makes his way to roof by climbing up between two carriages

Woah: The teenager makes it atop the carriage, however a railway bridge is fast approaching

Time to duck: The train surfer notices the railway bridge up ahead

Down: The teen (left) ducks down just inches from the bridge

Dangerous: The young man lies down in the small gap between the train and the bridge

Pleased with himself: The hooligan is all smiles after clearing the bridge

Silly: He even manages to pull a handstand while the train speeds down the track

At one incredible point in the video, the teen does a deaf-defying handstand and balances ontop of the train.

He falls back to his feet and then laughs into the camera.

MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told Boston Magazine that the Transit Police had been made aware of the video.

Detectives are now trying to find the boy in the clip.

'Obviously, such behavior is completely unacceptable,' he said.

At the 'very least' the young man faces trespassing charges, Pesaturo added.

The video has been watched on YouTube over 4,500 times since being uploaded on Thursday.

One viewer who left a comment claimed to be employed by the MBTA and said they were 'traumatized' by the video.

'Not cute at all this is very dangerous, and what happens if [you] fall or got your head cut off?,' the viewer wrote. one person wrote.

'Really, this is selfish and suicide.

'You're not thinking about [your] family or ours, meaning the drivers.

'I hope they catch you before its too late. Traumatized.'
