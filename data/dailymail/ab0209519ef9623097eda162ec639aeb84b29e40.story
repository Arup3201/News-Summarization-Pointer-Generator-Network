Week-old baby Zahra sticks her tongue out for the cameras

She's just a week old, but she's already six feet tall.

And Chester Zoo's new giraffe, baby Zahra, stepped out in public for the first time today - and even cheekily stuck her tongue out for the cameras.

Zahra, which means 'flower' in Swahili, is the adorable Rothschild's giraffe who made her debut at the zoo this month.

She was born to parents Aiofe and Meru, on 22 December and is their second baby.

Curator of mammals at Chester Zoo, Tim Rowlands, said: 'Giraffes give birth standing up and the calves fall about 6ft - so they really do come down to Earth with a bump.

'But we're happy to report that our new, not-so-little, youngster is doing well and is already confident on her long legs.

'Everyone at the zoo is thrilled with Zahra and she has really added to our Christmas and New Year celebrations.'

The zoo now has a herd of eight Rothschild's giraffes, which are classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Current population estimates suggest there are less than 1,100 remaining in the wild.

Mr Rowlands added: 'Whilst it's great that we have a nice herd here, in the wild this species really is under threat.

'Numbers are declining at a worrying rate due to a massive upsurge in poaching for their meat.

'So when people come here and see the likes of Zahra and see what magnificent animals Rothschild's giraffes are, we really want them to stop and think about the plight of the species in the wild.

The rare Rothschild's giraffe, who stands at 6ft tall, is already confident on her long legs, said Tim Rowlands, the curator of mammals at Chester Zoo

'Rothschild's giraffes are of high conservation priority and the need for a concerted conservation effort has never been more urgent.'

On top of its successful breeding record, Chester Zoo has supported important projects in the wild, including the first ever scientific review of the Rothschild's giraffe.

Its aim is to develop a long-term conservation strategy for the species in Africa.
