France has issued arrest warrants for three alleged terrorists said to have launched a murderous attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris – 33 years ago. 

All are said to be responsible for killing six people, and wounding 22 others, at Jo Goldenberg’s in the historic Rue des Rosiers.

It is in the centre of the Marais – which remains one of the most famous Jewish districts of the French capital.

Five men from the Abu Nidal Organisation, a terrorist group committed to the liberation of Palestine, ran in to the restaurant, unleashing grenades and firing indiscriminately with automatic weapons.

Alain Jakubowicz, of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA, as it is known in France) confirmed a report on RTL radio about the warrants. 

‘It gives meaning to justice,’ said Mr Jakubowicz. ‘No criminal, no terrorist can hide. Wherever he is, he is likely to be chased until the end of his life.’ 

France’s judicial authorities have not issued the names of the suspects, but all are said to be married with children and living in the Middle East and Scandinavia. 

One, aged 60, is said to be in Ramallah, in Palestine’s Occupied Territories, while another, aged 63, is in Jordan. 

The third is now 56, and living in Norway, with his wife and four children.

It is claimed that their part in the Jo Goldenberg attack has been established through a detailed investigation, which included interviews with survivors. 

Two Americans were among those killed in the terrorist outrage, which caused the worst loss of Jewish life in Paris since the Second World War Holocaust. 

The Rue de Rosiers currently remains under Army guard following an attack on a Kosher supermarket in January, in which four Jews died. 

Amedy Coulibaly, a Paris terrorist linked to Islamic State, was himself gunned down by police commandoes following the attack. 

Like the 1980s terrorists, Coulibaly said he was targeting Jews because of Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians. 

Jo Goldenberg, the owner of the Jewish restaurant – which is still in business – died last year aged 91. His family founded it before the wartime Occupation of Paris, when thousands of French Jews were entrained to concentration camps in Germany.
