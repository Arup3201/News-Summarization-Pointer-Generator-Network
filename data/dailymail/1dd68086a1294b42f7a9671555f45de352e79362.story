James Jones may have accidentally hanged himself with his school bag while swinging from branches in woodland near his home in Salford, Greater Manchester

A boy of 15 may have accidentally hanged himself with his school bag while climbing trees.

James Jones is feared to have become tangled in the cord of the bag as he clambered through branches in woodland near his home.

The teenager was playing truant from school and a note suggesting he was feeling depressed was found in his pocket, an inquest heard.

But the coroner said his family were convinced James did not intend to take his life. 

He recorded a verdict of misadventure and blamed the tragedy on ‘youthful exuberance’.

James, of Clifton, Salford, was said to be an ‘exemplary student’ at Harper Green High School in Farnworth, Bolton, excelling in art and also pursuing hobbies including chess, sailing and scuba-diving. He could read and write Japanese.

His family said he had a ‘heart of gold’ and was a hard-working, polite, conscientious boy. But he was also a fearless tree climber and loved nothing better than to play, high up in the branches, his sister Ashleigh, 21, said.

Tragedy struck on April 28, on James’s first day back at school after the Easter holiday.

He left to go to school as normal only to slip away to Clifton Marina and Country Park.

His mother, Wendy, 43, a care co-ordinator, had no idea James had skipped classes until he was not home by 6pm.

Thinking James would be at his friend’s house, she and her husband Barry, 43, were preparing to go there to check when a policeman knocked on the door to say their son’s body had been found by a dog walker.

Schoolbooks were strewn around the surrounding area and a note was found in James’s pocket which said he was ‘fed up’ and wanted to leave all of his possessions to his younger brother.

But Mrs Jones told the hearing in Bolton: ‘I don’t think he tried to take his life.

‘James had also written “don’t be sad”, but he scribbled that out.

‘I think he was trying to swing up in the tree and got caught. He would never see any danger.

‘He used to jump into the river and say, “It’s not very deep”.’

Coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘He feared no danger. He would climb trees to hide from his friends and surprise people and do what might be considered to be reckless as a method of surprise or performing pranks.

‘It is likely that in the course of that activity he died without the intention to cause death.

'I think something horrible has gone wrong and there was nobody there to help him.' 

His father, a service engineer, wept as he said: ‘He was a very happy boy and we miss him so much.’

Andrew Foster, headmaster at Harper Green School in Farnworth, said: 'James had no problems at school. James was a model pupil, he was conscientious, and polite, a lovely boy. He didn't present any issues with his behaviour or pastoral needs. It comes as a complete shock.'
