A football fan has blasted a Premier League club after shelling out £38 on an away-end seat that offered almost no view of the pitch.

Southampton supporter Sam White was horrified when he got to his seat at Loftus Road on Saturday to watch the away clash with QPR to find his view was almost completely blocked.

Instead of watching his beloved Saints clinch a last-gasp 1-0 win in the Premiership match, Mr White was forced to stare at a massive steel container - thought to be a commentary box - which obstructed most the pitch.

He was a unable to see the 90th-minute goal, the kick-off, or any of the action at one end.

He is now demanding a full refund for his £38 'restricted view' seat - because he claims it was far too restricted.

He said: 'I think it is crazy that they can legally sell these.

'Whether £38 is cheap for a Premier League ticket or not, I wouldn't have taken the ticket for free having known the view.

'I don't understand how the club hasn't been sanctioned before, it is absolute madness. I would have been a lot angrier had we not grabbed a 90th-minute winner.'

He is now demanding a refund after the picture he tweeted from his seat went viral on Twitter.

A spokesman for Queens Park Rangers FC said: 'Loftus Road is an all-seater stadium and while we understand the supporter’s frustration, we as a club advise fans to sit down for a number of reasons.

'Safety is of paramount importance and the main purpose for asking everyone to sit down, but it is also to ensure the best possible view of the pitch from all seats.

'Owing to the structure of Loftus Road, if everyone in the stadium stood up there would be a number of viewing positions where it would not be possible to see both goals. Loftus Road isn’t unique in this.

'Once again, we are sorry to hear of the supporter’s disappointment following his visit to Loftus Road and in light of his observations, we will be contacting all opposing clubs in advance of their fixture at our stadium to reiterate to them the importance of their supporters remaining seated to ensure the best possible viewing experience for their fellow fans.'
