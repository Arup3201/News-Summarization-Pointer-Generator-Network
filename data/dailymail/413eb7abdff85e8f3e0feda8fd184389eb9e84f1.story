Hallucinating, suicidal and sometimes unable to speak with her family, Schapelle Corby appears to be spinning out of control as her parole term derails under serious threats she be returned to Indonesian prison.

The 36-year-old's joy at being freed from Kerobokan prison appears to have turned to despair, with one episode of self harm with a knife and a whole day spent locked in the toilet, her brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha told The Age.

Indonesian authorities are expected to decide 'within days' as to whether they will revoke Corby's parole and place her back in jail.

'Hallucinating' and suicidal Schapelle Corby has spun out of control as her parole term derails and Indonesia threatens the 36-year-old drug smuggler with a return to prison

Mr Widyartha, who is Corby's parole guarantor, has begged journalists camped outside his house to ease up as grim-faced Indonesian officials - backed by a strident national media - appear set on cutting short the drug smuggler's hard won freedom.

An Indonesian newspaper and TV station are demanding she be immediately returned to custody for affronting the nation with sister Mercedes' claims the 4.2kg of cannabis Corby was caught with had been planted by Indonesian officials.

Channel Seven, which broadcast Mercedes' assertion about Schapelle's innocence, is also under investigation, with the Indonesian government saying the network paid the Corby family's bills in the luxury Villa Sentosa Seminyak.

One justice official has claimed Mercedes Corby had not told them the truth about Channel Seven paying for the family's stay at a luxury villa.

Corby's staunch supporters have also entered the fray, releasing a video on YouTube entitled The Houding of Schapelle Corby.

Using Channel 9 footage of Schapelle shot over the fence of the Widyartha compound, the video shows her disquiet when she realises she is being watched and filmed.

The clip was released by the Expendable Project, which has vigorously campaigned for Schapelle's innocence, trolling those who question it on social media.

Mr Widyartha said  his 'mentally ill' and heavily medicated sister-in-law, who had to leave the premises for meetings with her parole officer, hallucinated about being followed wherever she went.

'It's like an illusion,' he said. 'She's still seeing people [crowding her]. She's still traumatised.

'She's mentally ill. We sometimes can't speak to her. She stayed in the toilet for the whole day, she's still on heavy medication . . . for depression.'

Freedom gone sour: Schapelle Corby's moments of joy following her release have turned to fear that Indonesian authorities may revoke her parole and incracerate her again

In a reversal of his wife, Mercedes' denial about reports of Schapelle's episode with a knife, Mr Widyartha admitted Corby had attempted to self harm on Monday night in front of Bali Justice Office corrections chief Sunar Angus, saying it was because of the stress she was under.

When Mr Angus and a parole officer went to the house, Schapelle Corby grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself, reportedly saying about the constant media pack: 'What, are they waiting for me to kill myself?'

The family has now consulted a Balinese psychiatrist and an online psychologist.

Meanwhile, calls for the revocation of Corby's parole are growing louder, with two local media outlets urging action in the wake of last Sunday's programme about Corby on Channel Seven.

On Tuesday, Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin strongly suggested Corby may be sent back to jail.

'There is a probability that her parole will be reconsidered,' he told the Indonesian newspaper, Kompas, adding that if Corby’s parole was revoked it was her family’s fault and that he was under increasing political and domestic pressure following Mercedes' TV interview.

Indonesian network Metro TV has published a story which called for the immediate revocation of parole and suggested Indonesia was waiting for its government to take 'tough action'.

The online newspaper Media Indonesia claimed Mercedes Corby had 'ridiculed' Indonesian 'law and sovereignty' by suggesting in her interview Schapelle was innocent of smuggling the cannabis in the boogy board bag and had been 'the victim in a set up' by Indonesian officials. 

Corby was sentenced to 20 years in 
prison in 2005 for smuggling 4.1 kilograms of marijuana into Bali, 
hidden in a boogie board bag.

Jubilation after Corby's release (above) has evaporated as brother-in-law Wayan Widyartha admits a 'heavily medicated' Schapelle locked herself in a toilet for an entire day with her anxiety and depression

Corby's jump for joy (above) following her release has now given way to a suicide attempt, confirmed her her sister Merecdes's husband, Wayan, who is also Schapelle's parole guarantor

Her sentence was reduced after earning remissions for good behaviour, 
along with a five-year cut following an appeal for clemency.

She was released under strict parole conditions on February 10 and ordered to stay in Indonesia until 2017.

Indonesian justice officials warned Corby not to make any claims of innocence while on parole which might cause 'unease' in the nation.

Sunar Angus now says he has evidence the Seven network paid for the Corby's three week luxury resort stay, and that Mercedes had told him 'there was no payment'.

In
 the Seven documentary Corby was shown being whisked away from jail in a van and
 later swimming in the surf before enjoying a meal with her family.

While she did not give an 
interview, Mercedes told how her younger sister had been broken by her time in jail.

The clip also showed Schapelle arriving at the Seminyak villa.

She
was seen jumping up and down with excitement before a male voice is 
heard saying, ‘You can take that thing off,’ referring to the scarf 
across her face that perplexed viewers across Australia.

By all reports, the excitement and high spirits in the Corby camp in Bali have now disappeared.
