One of Australia's top-ranked young tennis players could be banned from the sport for two years after he was found to have taken the drug ecstasy - but he only faces a penalty because he tested positive on a match day.

Bradley Mousley, 18, has admitted to taking ecstasy two days before he was due to play at Melbourne Park on March 30, but will argue for a shorter sentence because he did not take the drug on a competition day,Â The Australian reported.

Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, ecstasy is permitted for use outside competition and players who test positive on non-competition days do not face penalties.

Bradley Mousley faces a two-year ban from tennis after he was found to have taken ecstasy

Mousley, 
who is close friends with fellow young tennis star Nick Kyrgios, is due 
to appear before a tribunal hearing in Melbourne on Tuesday.

Mousley's father Craig Mousley told Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on his son's legal defence.

'There's a hearing tomorrow, we're just going to go to the hearing see 
where it goes,' said Mr Mousley, who has been a coach and member of 
Tennis Australia for 22 years.

'I really don't want to talk about anything at the moment.'

Tennis Australia will argue for a full two-year suspension - a ban that could ruin Mousley's tennis career.

Lawyers acting for Mousley, Patrick Liptak and Paul Hayes, will reportedly argue that the drug would not have enhanced Mousley's performance because he took it two days before the match.

On those grounds they will reportedly argue he should only receive a three-month ban from the sport.

Tennis Australia will argue that the amount of ecstasy found in Mousley's system is consistent with him having taken the drug the night before the game.

They will argue for a two-year ban, in a push to stamp out a hard partying culture among its younger athletes.

Mousley has been suspended since his positive drug result was returned in May, and he has missed the junior French Open and Wimbledon tournaments as a result.

Barrister Paul Hayes told Daily Mail Australia he was unable to comment.

A Tennis Australia spokeswoman said: 'Tennis Australia abides by the Tennis Integrity Unit confidentiality policy and makes no public comment other than to "confirm the outcome of an investigation that results in disciplinary action being taken".'
