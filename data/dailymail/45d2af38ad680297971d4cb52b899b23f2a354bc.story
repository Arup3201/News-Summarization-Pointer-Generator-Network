A video has emerged showing the moment that a police officer allegedly kneed a law student so hard in the groin that he had to have a testicle removed, according to a political action group.

Jeremy Martin, 24, was driving a carload of friends near the University of New Mexico campus, where he studies law, on April 24 when a police officer pulled him over, claiming he ran a stop sign.

ProgressNowNM claimed it obtained video of the incident from the Albuquerque Police Department. It was captured by the lapel camera worn by the officer, Pablo Padilla, Progress said on its website.

The video shows Martin standing beside his car with his hands out as the police officer approaches and orders him to sit down on the curb.

Caught on camera: Progress Now shared a video apparently showing the moment a student was kicked by a cop and left him needing a testicle removed. Jeremy Martin can be seen as the officer approaches

Escalating: When Martin refuses to sit on the ground so the officer can carry out a field sobriety test, the officer threatens to stun and subdue him

Martin repeatedly interrupts him and moves around before agreeing to sit. The officer then says that Martin told him he'd had three beers, the video shows.

When Martin stands up, he ignores the officer's requests for him to sit down. Martin repeatedly asks him to let the other friends to drive the truck away.

A scuffle then ensues as the officer tries to subdue the driver, who says: 'Don't kick me in the nuts!'

The man is forced to the ground and road rash can be seen on his face in a photograph taken afterwards, KOB noted.

MailOnline has requested a comment from the Albuquerque Police Department about the video, but it has not yet been answered.

'Attack': During a scuffle, the officer apparently knees him in the groin, which Martin grabs defensively

Knocked down: He is then pinned to the ground by the officer and arrested on misdemeanor charges

Martin was booked on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and DWI. His lawyer said he was taken to Presbyterian Hospital for emergency surgery to have his testicle removed after it was 'shattered'.

A police report filed by officer Padilla claimed that Martin appeared to be intoxicated and admitted to having three beers after he was pulled over.

Martin went
 through a series of field sobriety tests then the officer asked him to 
sit on the curb. However, according to the report, Martin resisted.

Martin's attorney, Sam Bregman, told KOB4 that the officer reacted in the worst possible way.

'This officer felt the necessity to knee him so 
directly and with so much blunt force that it shattered his testicle,' he said.

Aftermath: Martin's mugshot show his bloodied face following the altercation with the police officer in April

Suit: Martin, pictured, is filing a lawsuit against the officers involved in the incident, his lawyer said

His
 face is visibly injured in his mug shot, and while the police report 
mentions those injuries it does not mention his testicle.

Bregman is now filing suit against the officers involved.

'How does a DWI investigation with a first year law 
student - when he absolutely did nothing to provoke the officer - 
result in the shattering of his testicle and emergency surgery to remove
 it?' Bregman asked.

In Martin's favor is that the police report contains several inconsistencies.

Besides
 omitting the injury, the report claims Martin went through a stop sign 
while traveling north on Wellesley Place, but it's impossible to travel 
north on that street and reach the stop sign in question.
