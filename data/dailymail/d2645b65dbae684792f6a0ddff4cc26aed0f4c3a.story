Chelsea will consider loaning Andrej Kramaric to Leicester City as they look to close a £7.5m deal with his club for the striker on Monday.

Leicester have a £7.8m bid on the table for the HNK Rijeka goalscorer but the player wanted to move to a bigger club.

Juventus have also made a play for Kramaric but only wanted to offer £4.5m plus add-ons. If all is agreed on Monday the player is expected to travel to London on January 5 to have a medical.

The contract is for four and a half years and the player will initially be paid around £20,000 a week after tax.

Kramaric, who has scored 28 goals in all competitions this season, has already agreed to join the Premier League leaders.

Inter Milan are proposing an 18-month loan for Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah.

The Italians are hopeful of agreeing a deal with Arsenal for Lukas Podolski and are keen to talk to Liverpool about Lucas Leiva.

The deal for Salah would be a loan with view to a £12m transfer enabling Chelsea to recoup the money they spent on the Egypt international last January when they pipped Liverpool to his signature from Basle.

The 22-year-old has made 17 appearances since his move.

Sunderland have also shown interest in taking Salah on loan.

Bordeaux have made an enquiry to take Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo on loan. The 21-year-old also has interest from Lorient and clubs in England and Italy. He had been offered to Inter Milan as an alternative to Podolski.

Schalke have confirmed they are chasing Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic.

Sportsmail reported Schalke's interest, along with AC Milan's earlier this month, and Roberto di Matteo has pressed for a conclusion to talks.

Chairman of Schalke, Clemens Tonnies said: 'Yes, we are chasing his (Matija Nastasic's) signature. Our manager, Roberto di Matteo, has eyed him for his plans. And the player definitely wants to join our club, too.'

The one snag could be Schalke's request to sign him on an initial loan with City wanting around £10m for the 21-year-old Serbia international centre-back.

Queens Park Rangers are to ask West Ham if they can sign Mauro Zarate on loan.

Manager Harry Redknapp is launching a desperate bid to bolster his striking options ahead of the transfer window with QPR struggling to fend off relegation.

Redknapp has made enquiries for Atletico Madrid's Cristian Rodriguez also, as reported in Sportsmail, but the Uruguay winger is weighing up other options too.

QPR expect to hear their fate soon regarding their Financial Fair Play breach.

West Ham may allow Chile international Zarate to move if they find an alternative in the market. Diafra Sakho has been called up to play for Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations but may yet refuse to go.

Tottenham are monitoring developments with Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot.

The 19-year-old has been a target for Roma and Arsenal over the past year as he struggles to cement a regular place with PSG's all-stars. 

Tottenham are looking to offload a number of midfielders this window and Rabiot is one of a number of players they are considering as a potential replacement.

Spurs and Roma have made offers for Newell's Old Boys teenage striker Ezequiel Ponce. However, Roma have offered to loan the 17-year-old back.

Newell's club president Guillermo Lorente told Ole: 'The family has received many informal offers. At present we are negotiating in agreement with his father. The proposal from Roma could bring some advantage compared to that of Tottenham.

'In Rome there's a possibility for Ezequiel to play another year at Newell's, while going to Tottenham would be another six months. In my opinion both offers are valid, although I think Roma's is slightly better.'

AC Milan are interested in a deal for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado and will discuss the possibilities today (Monday). However, the cash-strapped Italians may only be able to offer an initial loan which Daniel Levy is likely to reject.

Leeds United are close to signing Sassuolo striker Leonardo Pavoletti on loan until the end of the season.

The 26-year-old striker was given a tour of the club's training ground on Friday and was present at the 2-0 defeat by Wigan Athletic. The deal has to be on loan due to the transfer embargo Leeds are under for breaching Financial Fair Play Rules.

Cardiff City striker Javi Guerra is in talks over a return to Spain with Deportivo La Coruna.

The 32-year-old has only played five times since arriving from Real Valladolid in the summer with his last appearance against Bournemouth in September. 

Guerra could yet be followed out of the door by manager Russell Slade as rumblings continue about his future following recent results.
