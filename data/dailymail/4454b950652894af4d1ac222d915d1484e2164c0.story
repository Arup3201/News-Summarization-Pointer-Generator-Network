Adrian Lubecki, 19, has been accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy linked to four deaths

This is the teenager accused of supplying a lethal batch of ecstasy tablets that have been linked to four separate deaths.

Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich in Suffolk, appeared before magistrates this morning charged with supplying the red triangular drugs believed to have led to the deaths of four people. 

The teenager was remanded in custody as his case was referred to Crown Court. 

It comes after four men  died after taking ecstasy tablets stamped with an 'S' symbol, police believe.

A fifth man was taken to hospital on New Year's Day and is making a recovery. 

The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve.

Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. 

The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - who died hours after Mr Hocking, is also believed to have been connected.

All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman 'S' logo.

A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation.

Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. 

They are thought to contain a high amount of PMMA, often found in non-pure ecstasy. The chemical has prolonged effects, prompting some drug users to take double the amount they would normally if consuming MDMA-based ecstasy. 

Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths.

'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them.

'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.' 

Meanwhile, Suffolk Police said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Ipswich town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a 'Superman' pill.

He was taken to Ipswich Hospital but has since been discharged.

Chief Superintendent Jon Brighton said: 'It is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation.

'I would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills, please do not take them or pass them on, please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed.

'Our number one priority is to remove these drugs from our communities and prevent any further harm.'

Police believe the deaths of the three men in Ipswich may be linked after they were called to three addresses across the town in the space of one week (pictured)
