Though melanoma and other skin cancers are some of the most common in older people, it is extremely rare to see them in toddlers. 

But  Matt and Michelle Prebble found out the hard way it can still occur, when their two-year-old daughter Frankie was diagnosed with a melanoma.

'Everyone was in shock,' Michelle told Daily Mail Australia.

'We saw her surgeon on a Monday and he wanted to operate the next day.'

The Cancer Council of Australia state that two in three Australians will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer by the time they are 70, but it is extremely rare for anyone under 4 to be diagnosed.

What started off as a small red spot 'the size of a pin-head' on Frankie's arm last year, quickly developed into a larger mark setting off alarm bells.

'It started growing and we thought okay, this is a bit unusual', Michelle, from Perth in West Australia, said.

From there a trip to the GP and a follow-up appointment with a dermatologist put Frankie on the fast-track to having surgery in April of this year.

'She had one surgery and it came back as a spitzoid melanoma,' Michelle revealed.

Frankie then had to undergo a second surgery to create more of a buffer around the site where the tumor was.  

And although Frankie did take a little while to recover from the surgery, she's fighting fit now.

The youngster had to undergo two surgeries to completely remove the melanoma and now has rigorous and regular check-ups

'It took a couple of months for everything to settle down, her arm was quite swollen and the scar was quite red,' her mum said.

Wanting to put a 'positive spin' on the experience for their daughter, Matt and Michelle Prebble named the scar her 'brave mark' and  taught Frankie how to care for the sore on her own.

'She puts her own little gel on there twice a day', Michelle revealed.

Following the procedures Frankie now requires regular and extensive check-ups and screenings, something she may have to undergo for the rest of her life.

A check up two weeks ago put Frankie in the clear, however her parents are awaiting more tests from overseas to find out more information about the tumor. 

For now, the two-year-old has to undergo lymph node tests and skin scans every three months, plus has had one PET scans so far and will require another later in the year.

Frankie's parents said they still have many questions about how their daughter got the disease so young

Although Frankie has healed well from her procedures the Prebbles still have 'a lot of questions hanging over our heads.'

'We want to know why a two-year-old is presented with such a diagnosis, it's obviously not sun-related as she's only two,' Michelle revealed.

Frankie's surgeon was Dr Mark Lee, who works out of the St John of God Hospital in Subiaco. 

Dr Lee told Daily Mail Australia that patients like Frankie are 'unique and confronting' but also particularly puzzling as there must be another cause for the cancer besides sun exposure.

'There's no family history with Frankie, there's nothing that we can really put our finger on at all, it's a big mystery,' he said.

Despite these rare instances, Dr Lee said the occurrence of such cancers in young people in West Australia is on the decline, and that's a positive for the nation as a whole.

'It suggests that the sun0-smart message is getting through in Australia', he said.

Dr Lee also spoke to the ABC, telling them that while his young patient is cancer-free now, she will need to keep a close eye on things as she gets older.

'It doesn't mean we rest on our laurels. We still need to follow her up very closely, probably lifelong, since she's had something so early', he said. 

Michelle said there's no way her melanoma could have been sun-related as Frankie is so young

This weekend Matt is taking part in the Ride to Conquer Cancer and has already raised $7000

The Prebbles were lucky to catch their daughter's melanoma early, but that's not the case for all people diagnosed with what can be a devastating disease. 

However the ABC reported there are six new drugs which have been approved for Australian clinical trials, described by Dr Lee as 'very exciting'. 

Keen to assist research in the area, Matt is taking part in the Sun Super Ride to Conquer Cancer this weekend in Perth - which entails completing a gruelling 200 kilometre bike ride.

He's already raised over $7000 and hopes that some of the funds can contribute towards researching some of the rarer forms of cancer, like Frankie's.

The Prebbles also shared their experience following a breakfast at the weekend, held by the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in West Australia, a centre that along with Melanoma WA has been of great assistance to Frankie and Prebble family this year.

The Prebbles hope the funds raised can go towards research for rare cancers like the one Frankie had
