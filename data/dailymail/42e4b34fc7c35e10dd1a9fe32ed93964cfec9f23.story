Bernhard Goetz, the controversial 'Subway Vigilante' who shot four teenagers on the New York subway in 1984, has been charged with misdemeanor sale and possession of marijuana, authorities said Saturday.

The 65-year-old was arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court on three misdemeanor drug charges for sale and possession of marijuana. He was released on his own recognizance and is due back in court next month.

Goetz became a public figure after he shot four black youths he claimed were going to mug him, prompting debate over race relations and frustration with high crime rates of New York in the 1980s.

Out and about: Bernie Goetz seen on the streets of Manhattan in February 2012. It has been reported that he was arrested for trying to make a pot deal with an undercover cop on Friday

Goetz was nabbed in a sting operation in
Union Square park Friday evening for selling $30 worth of marijuana to 
an undercover officer, police said.

He asked the woman if she wanted to get 
high, then went back to his apartment, where he has lived for decades, 
and returned with marijuana, authorities said. He was arrested on 
charges of criminal sale of marijuana.

According to The Post, Goetz was arrested on the street at about 5.45pm after getting into conversation with the police officer.

A police source said: 'He told her he wanted to get high with her and sold her a small amount of pot in a tissue.'

Goetz wasn't being targeted specifically; he just happened to cross paths with the undercover officer assigned to crack down on drug dealing in the park, authorities said.

After a tumultuous trial in 1985 that attracted much media attention, Goetz was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault.

With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense.

Goetz ended up serving eight months in jail, but his legacy lasted much longer than his time in the big house.

He went on to become an activist for a tougher focus on crime, and he proceeded to run for mayor of the city in 2001 and the city's public advocate in 2005.

Scene: Goetz shot four black youths he claimed were going to rob him on the subway in December 1984. With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense

Neither bid was successful, but Goetz traded in on his given nickname by opening an repair store called Vigilante Electronics.

His case came back up in the press in December 2011 when one of the four men he shot killed himself in an apparent suicidal drug overdose on the 27th anniversary of the attack.

James Ramseur was found dead in the Paradise Motor Inn in the Bronx. Ramseur was the youngest of four teens who surrounded Goetz on the 2 train on December 22, 1984.

Believing the group was about to rob him, Goetz pulled out a .38 calibre revolver and fired, striking each of them once.

Ramseur was shot in the chest, but survived. The other teenagers - Barry Allen, Troy Canty and Darrell Cabey - were also hospitalized and were not killed.

Cabey was left paralyzed by the bullet that struck him.

Controversial: Goetz was a divisive figure but was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault

Goetz was briefly a fugitive, but turned himself in to police a little more than a week later in Concord, New Hampshire. Goetz claimed it was self-defense, alleging the youths intended to rob him.

During the trial, Ramseur testified that they were panhandling, and not demanding money from Goetz, but it was later reported that the group was intending to mug him.

Goetz was convicted of a gun charge but acquitted of attempted murder.

Three of the suspects were found to have screwdrivers at the time of the shooting, which the suspects claimed were used to break into arcade games to steal quarters, not as weapons.

Goetz filed for bankruptcy shortly after Cabey won a $43 million lawsuit against him. Cabey's attorney, Ron Kuby, said Saturday his client remains paralyzed in a wheelchair and has never received a penny from Goetz.
