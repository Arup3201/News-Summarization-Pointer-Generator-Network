Sean Tustin, 23, threatened to tell the woman¿s boyfriend what she had been doing if she did not pay up

A rugby player blackmailed a student for more than £2,000 after she had sex with him  and sent him a topless picture of herself from her mobile phone.

Sean Tustin, 23, threatened to  tell the woman’s boyfriend what she had been doing if she did  not pay up.

A court heard 6ft 3in Tustin charmed his 20-year-old victim in a bar before the pair began sending sexually explicit text messages to each other.

But after Tustin discovered she already had a boyfriend, he threatened to reveal their secret relationship.

He then persuaded the brunette to send him a semi-naked picture of herself.

The court heard the woman, who cannot be named, had an ‘attraction’ for Tustin, who used to play as a forward for lower league Welsh rugby team, Baglan RFC, a feeder club to the Ospreys, former club of Gavin Henson.

Prosecutor Kate Smith said: ‘He asked the woman to send him a picture of herself topless but she said she was uncomfortable with the idea.

‘But Tustin said if she didn’t he would reveal the sexual text messages to her boyfriend.

‘She didn’t want that to happen so she took a picture and sent it.’

Swansea Crown Court heard the pair later met up and had consensual sex before Tustin sent another message demanding he be paid £100 to keep quiet.

Miss Smith said: ‘Again he threatened to reveal their affair so she met him at Tesco supermarket to give the money. Later, again by text message, he asked for another £200, which she paid.’

The court heard when Tustin upped his demands to £2,000 the student went to the police. In a statement the victim said she felt anxious and feared she was going to have a nervous breakdown over the blackmail.

The court heard the pair had begun sending each other messages of a sexual nature in January last year.

He had later asked the student to send him a picture of herself topless.

In October last year she received another message from Tustin saying he wanted £2,000.

Miss Smith said: ‘At this point, she 
decided enough was enough.’ The court heard that in total Tustin 
received £350 from the woman before she called police.

The father-of-three, from Port Talbot, South Wales, was jailed for 20 months after admitting four charges of blackmail.

Judge Paul Thomas told him: ‘Blackmail
is an ugly despicable crime. You took advantage of a woman’s affection 
and attraction for you for the sleazy purpose of extracting money for 
yourself.’

Defending, Frank Phillips said: ‘It’s 
clear he didn’t think the position through. It’s a one-off, 
uncharacteristic offence which is not likely to be repeated.’

Tustin, who had a previous conviction for theft, has recently become a father for the third time, the court heard.

The judge sentenced him to four terms of 20 months to be served concurrently.
