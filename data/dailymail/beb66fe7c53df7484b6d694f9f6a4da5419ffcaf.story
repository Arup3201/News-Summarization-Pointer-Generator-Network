A central Ohio art museum has apologized after a visitor examining a Lego model of Columbus noticed it included a Lego figure with a gun pointing at the front door of the model police station.

It wasn't part of the design for the exhibit at the Columbus Museum of Art, and it upset the Columbus firefighter who spotted it a week after two New York policemen were gunned down in their patrol car.

'I thought, "Am I really seeing that? Am I overreacting?"' Bob Dickson told the Columbus Dispatch.

Dickson, who noticed the figure along with his daughters on December 27, was so angry he wrote letters to the museum as well as the Central Ohio Lego Train Club, who designed the display.

The museum and the club that designed the exhibit said the gunman figure would be immediately removed.

 It's not clear how the figure got there.

Museum spokeswoman Nancy Colvin tells The Columbus Dispatch that it is possible the figure came from an area near the exhibit where visitors can create their own Lego structures.

According to Colvin, a docent roams between exhibits but no one is in the Lego room at all times.

'[It] was very unfortunate, and we’re very sorry this happened,' Colvin said.
