Inflation dropped sharply last month – but there is little cheer for families because the rate is still rising three times higher than the average pay packet.

The consumer prices index fell from 2.7 per cent to 2.2 per cent between September and October – the lowest rate for 13 months, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday.

The Prime Minister hailed the ‘significant drop’ – driven by decreases in the cost of fuel and the smaller-than-expected impact of higher university tuition fees – as ‘encouraging news for hard-working people’.

Costs: The CPI rate of inflation has fallen to 2.2 per cent, the lowest level for a year

But over the past 12 months the average worker has earned a pay rise of just 0.7 per cent, amid a backdrop of crippling double-digit energy bill increases and a 4.3 per cent rise in food costs.

To add to the pressure on households, it has now been four years since the Government has kept the inflation rate below its 2 per cent target. Pay rises have also remained below inflation throughout that period.

Economists predict that last month’s drop in inflation could be reversed when the recent spate of energy price increases take effect.

Fuel prices fell between September and October, with petrol down by about 5p per litre and diesel around 3p per litre cheaper.

The impact of the rise in tuition fees to up to £9,000, introduced last autumn, did not have the same impact, said the Office for National Statistics.

The ONS said transport prices overall fell 1.5 month-on-month in October, largely as a result of supermarkets rushing to cut prices.

There were also downward contributions from air fares and prices for secondhand cars.

Food inflation fell from 4.8 per cent to 4.3 per cent, easing some pressure on household costs.

In a message on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘Encouraging news for hard-working people with a significant drop in inflation - this Government is sticking to a long term plan for Britain.’

Ministers hope that pay rises will overtake increases in prices before the 2015 election so that voters start feeling better off as a result of the economic recovery.

However, the latest round of energy price hikes of up to 10 per cent are not included in the figures and are likely to drive up inflation from the new year.

EDF today announced rises 3.9 per cent amid reports E.ON will push up prices by 6.6 per cent.

ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

The prospect of falling inflation will ease fears that the Bank of England will put up interest rates any time soon.

Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘October's inflation data suggests that the UK economy is hitting a sweet spot of accelerating growth and falling inflation.

‘Looking forward, inflation may tick up a touch in November as some of the recent announcements of hefty increases in energy prices start to take effect.’

Motoring: Falling petrol prices were the biggest factor in reducing the annual rise in the cost of living

Motorists have seen the cost of filling up their tank fall in recent weeks, after months of rises.

Petrol prices fell by 4.9p per litre between September and October this year, to stand at 131.6 pence.

Catherine McKinnell, Labour's shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis under David Cameron continues.

‘And with inflation-busting hikes in energy prices in the pipeline families and pensioners will carry on feeling the squeeze.’
