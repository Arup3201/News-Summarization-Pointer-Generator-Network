Patents typically feature groundbreaking devices or innovative uses of existing technology, but Amazon’s latest filing is neither. 

The retailer has been awarded a patent for taking photos on a white background - a process that has been carried out since cameras were invented.  

Its filing even details the best way to set up a photography studio, where to place the ‘elevated platform’ - or table - and a step-by-step process.

Amazon is developing a system to send items to buyers before they have even decided they want it.

The technique could mean deliveries arrive within minutes - or could even be waiting for buyers when they decide to buy.

A patent filed by Amazon in January revealed the plans for its 'anticipatory package shipping'.

According to this patent, the packages could wait at the shippers’ hubs, on trucks or even in an apartment building until an order arrives.

Packages would be shipped without an exact address, which could be added once an order is made.

This would allow Amazon to ship copies of items such a popular book on the day it is published, for instance.

The reasoning behind Amazon's application remains a mystery.

One source, however, suggested Amazon might be wanting to patent how products are photographed and rotated on the site's vast catalogue.

Although it sounds like a joke, the patent is available on the U.S Patent and Trademark Office website and was awarded in March.

Of course, the filing is more specific and although it describes a standard ‘studio arrangement with a background comprising a white cyclorama and a front light source’, it does go into more detail. 

For example, it states the ‘image capture position’ needs to be located between ‘the background and the front light source in the longitudinal axis’, and the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens. 

It goes on to say there should be ‘at least one image capture device further configured with an ISO setting of 320 and an f-stop value of 5.6.’

Images of the arrangement show the ‘elevated platform’, depicted as a table, positioned between the ‘image capture position and the background in the longitudinal axis’.

Amazon additionally claims the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens and goes on to say there should be 'at least one image capture device further configured with an ISO setting of about 320 and an f-stop value of about 5.6'. This patent image shows the layout described in the files

It goes on to describe a 'front light source being directed toward a subject on the elevated platform’ with ‘a first rear light source aimed at the background and positioned between the elevated platform and the background.'

In short, Amazon has described a camera pointing at a person sat on a table being lit from the front and rear, with additional lights above and below. 

Amazon claimed this arrangement will result in photos that don’t require a lot of editing in post-production.

But as Gizmodo’s Ashley Feinberg explained: 'Amazon almost undoubtedly did not pioneer this technique’ but ‘the extensive and specific conditions listed mean there is pretty much no way to either violate it or know if the patent has even been violated in the first place.
