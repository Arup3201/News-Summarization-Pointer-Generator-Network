A British ex-pat has died after being hit by a speedboat while snorkeling off a beach in Grenada.

Martin Beaumont, 55, was struck by the boat, along with a friend who was swimming with him on Sunday.

The injured friend is believed to have worked with Mr Beaumont, who was general manager of the University Club in the island's capital, St George's. He was being treated in hospital.

Workplace: St George's University in Grenada, where Mr Beaumont worked as a general manager

Friends said Mr Beaumont, believed to 
have lived in Cornwall before emigrating, had lived on the Caribbean 
island for four years with his wife and was well known and liked within 
the community.

He ran the private venue for faculty and staff at St George's University, which is Grenada's independent medical school.

He was also a keen swimmer who was often to be found snorkeling in the sheltered bays of St George’s.

One friend said: 'He was a good 
friend and will be sadly missed. He was well loved by a lot of people 
here and his death has come as a terrible shock.'

Police have released few details about the accident as the investigation is ongoing.

A spokesman said: 'The investigation is current and we are not making any comment until all inquiries have been completed.'

The driver of the speedboat was a physician and he has been interviewed by police, but he has not been charged with any offence.

Police sources said they were seeing if the driver was too close to the shore when he hit Mr Beaumont.

A British Consul spokesman on the island said that they were aware of Mr Beaumont’s death.
