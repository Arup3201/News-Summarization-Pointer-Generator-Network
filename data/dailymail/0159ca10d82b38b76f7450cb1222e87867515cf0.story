David Cameron will today claim the values he learned from his disabled father can save Britain in its ‘hour of reckoning’.

The Prime Minister will warn the country is in a global race and must sink or swim in its efforts to deal with the economic crisis.

In an unusually personal speech to the Conservative conference, he will say ‘hard work, strong values, taking responsibility and serving others’ – qualities he learned from his late father, Ian – are needed to ensure Britain remains ‘the greatest country on earth’.

Dining out: The couple arrive at the the Diwan Balti restaurant in the city to celebrate

Despite a series of crowd-pleasing 
announcements that have cheered the Tory faithful, Mr Cameron will 
insist the party remains on the political ‘common ground’.

He will say his mission is to show that Conservatives are ‘for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay’.

The Prime Minister celebrated his 46th birthday at the conference last night with his wife Samantha, who travelled up from London to take him out for a curry.

He had earlier told BBC Breakfast: ‘I’m looking forward to Samantha coming back to Birmingham and I’m hoping she’s going to take me out for a balti.’

Perhaps keen to seize the opportunity for some good publicity, one of Mr Cameron’s aides tipped off a news agency photographer about where the couple would be dining.

Mr Cameron had earlier posted a picture on Twitter, above, of him laughing with Foreign Secretary William Hague after being presented with a birthday cake in the shape of a caterpillar.

Traditional
Tory values, he will argue, are compassionate because they are good not
just for the strong and successful in society but also the poor, the 
weak and the vulnerable.

‘Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society,’ he will say.

The
Prime Minister will offer a tacit acknowledgement that many voters are 
still unsure what he stands for after seven years as party leader, 
saying: ‘There is nothing complicated about me.

‘I
believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country. 
And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. This is still
the greatest country on earth. We showed that again this summer.

‘But it’s tough. These are difficult 
times, we’re being tested. How will we come through it? Again, it’s not 
complicated. Hard work, strong families, taking responsibility, serving 
others.’  The road to recovery following the financial crisis, the Prime
Minister will admit, is proving longer and harder than anyone 
anticipated.

But aides 
said he believed many people had failed to realise the scale of the 
threat facing Britain and other debt-laden Western economies.

‘Unless
we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show 
determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it 
has been in the past,’ he will tell his Birmingham audience.

Close to the heart: David Cameron with son Ivan in 2004. He will use his own family¿s story as he seeks to explain what makes him tick - speaking frankly of his late son, Ivan, and his father Ian, who died in 2010

‘Because
the truth is this. We’re in a global race today, and that means an hour
of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.’

His father Ian, who died in 2010. In his speech he will say: ¿My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought'

The Prime Minister will dismiss calls
for a ‘Plan B’ on the economy, ridiculing Labour for wanting to borrow 
yet more money in a ‘massive gamble with our economy and our future’.

But
he will use his own family’s story as he seeks to explain what makes 
him tick – revealing that his grandfather abandoned his grandmother, and
speaking frankly of his late son, Ivan, and his father Ian, who died in
2010.

‘My dad 
influenced me much more than I ever thought. He was born with no heels 
on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they’re meant to be. But 
he never complained – even when he lost both those legs later in life.

‘Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child. Probably a lonely child. But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full, usually with something alcoholic in it.

‘When I was a boy ... I asked him what he was most proud of. It was simple – working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family. Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.

‘Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story. Work hard. Family comes first, but put back in to the community too.’

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron is set to push through gay marriage laws as early as next year despite backbench dissent.

He has told ministers the reform is a ‘straightforward matter of equality’ and should happen as soon as possible.

MPs have been promised a free vote on the plans.
