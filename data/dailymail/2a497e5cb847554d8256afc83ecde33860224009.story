Calum Chambers must be so relieved to be joining up with England this week.

At least Roy Hodgson won’t hang him out to dry like Arsene Wenger did at Swansea on Sunday.

When you’re starting to think the England manager has more of a grasp of in-game management than the Arsenal boss, then it’s time to ask some serious questions of Wenger.

I like Chambers, and I think his signing was a shrewd investment from Wenger in the summer.

But he’s not quick, and the defender was left exposed, alone, dealing with a winger who was having a brilliant game and rinsing his man for pace every time he got the ball.

Mathieu Flamini didn’t go across to help out, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain preferred to go forward, the speed demon Hector Bellerin stayed on the bench. What was the Arsenal manager actually doing?

Wenger’s grasp of the problems at Arsenal, which have led to the team losing a three-goal lead at home to Anderlecht, and then losing a game they were winning at Swansea, is virtually non-existent.

To back this up let me give you a selection of quotes from Wenger which were posted on the official Arsenal website after the Swansea defeat...

Wenger: 'We were quite solid defensively and didn’t look in the need to change.'

So he couldn’t see how exposed Chambers was?

Wenger: 'I think he (Flamini) had a decent game.' And then on Alexis Sanchez: 'He didn’t have the best game today.'

After those answers, do you trust his judgment of a player’s performance?

Wenger: 'We were struggling a bit on the right side but I have no experienced players on the bench. It was unfortunate. I don’t think there was a need to change.'

There was clearly a need to change. But bringing on Yaya Sanogo for Chambers in the final minute was laughable. And why were there no experienced players on the bench? Because Wenger’s squad management and transfer policy are so excruciatingly pathetic. Letting Thomas Vermaelen go was bad, failing to replace him was shocking.

Wenger: 'The free kick is difficult to predict he would score from there. It’s not like we gave a great goal chance away. I feel the free-kick was a bit harsh.'

It was a free kick 25 yards out! Why is it difficult to predict Gylfi Sigurdsson could score from there? This is a player who has scored free kicks from that distance for club and country in the past (for Iceland away to Slovenia last year, for Swansea at Wigan in March 2012, for Reading against Swansea and at Ipswich). 

So how come Wenger wasn’t aware? Given Sigurdsson’s quality, a free kick conceded 25 yards from goal was obviously a 'great goal chance'. And was it harsh? Kieran Gibbs was guilty of sliding in, nowhere near the ball, and bringing down a player as Swansea broke away.

And when asked why Chelsea have made such a good start, Wenger’s reply was: 'There is no obvious reason.'

The reasons are clear: Jose Mourinho identifying Chelsea’s weaknesses and solving them with two signings, one of whom was a player Arsenal could have signed but didn’t, allowing the Blues to take him.

The answers Wenger gives could possibly be twisted by his more deluded supporters into some sort of desperate attempt to protect his players.

The Arsenal manager needed to protect his teenage right back on Sunday, but failed to do so.

The irony is that despite the game being played in front of him, Wenger does not see it. Old habits die hard, I suppose.

He used to be brilliant. But he isn’t any more.
