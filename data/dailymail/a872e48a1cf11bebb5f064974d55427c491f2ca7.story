Fears of another Sangatte were triggered yesterday when the French government announced plans for a new centre for migrants in Calais.

Intended as a ‘humanitarian response’ to the growing number of people living rough in the area, the centre will offer mainly medical facilities.

But residents warned that migrants would flock to the proposed facility.

French authorities will offer medical and legal advice to thousands of migrants seeking asylum in the UK at the centre if it is opened 

With the authorities promising legal advice for those seeking asylum in Britain, even the deputy mayor of Calais admitted it could serve as a hotspot for those seeking to cross the Channel. 

Sangatte was a controversial Red Cross centre located just outside the port that acted as a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed following riots in 2002.

Official figures now put the number of migrants in Calais at 2,300 – up from 1,500 in August.

Violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence. 

Announcing the new centre yesterday, France’s interior minister said he wanted to stop illegal camping in Calais and house asylum seekers throughout the country.

Bernard Cazeneuve also said migrants wanting to apply for asylum in Britain would be offered legal advice to help them with their applications.

But he insisted these measures would not encourage more migrants to arrive in Calais, as happened with Sangatte.

The facility will be housed in a leisure centre – a summer school for children – with kitchens capable of catering for up to 500 people. There is also heating, toilets and showers.

French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants this week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel 

The mayor of Calais said last week she could close the port if the situation was not improved soon

There are beds at the centre, but Mr Cazeneuve said only the most vulnerable, including mothers with children, would be allowed to use them. 

Mr Cazeneuve backed the centre ‘with one condition – that the operating rules are clear and everyone demonstrates responsibility for the security of the site, and that it is protected from savage behaviour.

‘We will make sure that the building of illegal camps is stopped’.

Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, said the centre could be a new Sangatte. ‘Some are saying that it will and we can’t do anything because Calais is already a magnet,’ he said. ‘Well, Calais is not. England is.

‘It was the same problem with Sangatte at the beginning. It was working well but it’s the number of migrants which causes problems, not the migrants themselves.

‘It could become a problem again at the new centre: I am not saying it will, but it could.’

He said that housing migrants in centres around France would not work as they would go straight back to the Calais camp. 

‘When a camp is dismantled and migrants are sent to different parts of the country and told that they can claim asylum in France, they are back in Calais within a week,’ he added.

Critics fear the centre could have a similar effect to one opened in 2002 which attracted hordes of Afghan and Kurdish migrants who had to be controlled by police after breaking out into riots (pictured)

Mr Cazeneuve also announced that more police would be drafted in, saying that security was his number one priority. ‘People from Calais have the right to peace,’ he said.

‘My first task is to assure their safety. So from today there will be a total of 450 police and gendarmes mobilised in Calais, which is exceptional for a district of 75,000 inhabitants, but totally justified given the situation.’

Britain has given £12million to the French to enhance security measures as clashes between migrants have grown more violent and their attempts to reach Britain more desperate.

Denis Robin, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, said there had been a marked rise in crime linked to the migrants. He did not give a date for the opening of the centre.
