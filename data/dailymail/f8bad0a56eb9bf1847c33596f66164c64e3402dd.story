It looks like Santa has got his work cut out this Christmas.

These astounding pictures show staff at a huge, real-life grotto preparing for the busiest online shopping days of the year.

But rather than working in Lapland, they are busy at a plant in Rugeley, Staffordshire run by internet shopping firm Amazon, which yesterday, Black Friday, received an order about every 35 seconds.

The enormous scale of Amazon's Christmas operation is evident from this picture of its warehouse in Staffs, which delivers toys, games and electronic equipment

The massive warehouse is the only one of Amazon's UK distribution centres which doesn't sell books. On average it will receive an order once every 35 seconds

Eager beavers: Amazon's hard-working staff are filling box after box of items bought on Black Friday - where Britons are likely to spend more than £200million

Staff were in overdrive as they packaged and distributed thousands of products for yesterday's sale, which, along with next week's Cyber Monday, are the two busiest online shopping days of the year.

The American tradition was introduced by Amazon to Britain in 2010, giving bargain-hunters discounts of up to 40 per cent on more than 1,000 products, which the retail giant says is more than twice as many as last year.

The name of the shopping frenzy is believed to represent retailers moving into profit after nine months in the red.

The huge savings will continue on Cyber Monday, which last year saw Amazon receive orders for more than three million items.

The Staffordshire 'fulfillment centre' is one of eight Amazon depots in Britain and sells a mixture of books, toys, games and electronic products.

Despite the demand for gadgets and e-books, the company says sales of physical are actually increasing, despite industry-wide figures showing an 11 per cent slump for the first quarter of this year.

The depot houses five-storeys of shelves which contain more than five million items over 500,000sqft.

Products are scanned and sorted within 12 hours of hitting the warehouse, before an army of pickers scour the shelves collecting customer orders at the command of their hand-held scanners.

Conveyor belts take these orders down to a team of 'packing associates', who then box and get them ready for shipping, which takes place at five times through the day.

Although its distribution centres currently rely on manpower, earlier this year Amazon struck a deal with robot-maker Kiva Systems that will see the depots automated in the future. The has a further three warehouses planned for the coming year.

British shoppers are expected to splurge £200million on bargains today, which experts say will smash records and boost struggling businesses.

Orders come in so fast that there is no time to put many products on shelves. Instead they are put on huge pallets in an area known as 'mass land'

Workers are required round-the-clock to meet the phenomenal demand for Christmas gifts at Amazon's eight UK distribution centres

The delivery firm will draft in an extra 1,000 workers at its depot, who will help process about 1,000tonnes of goods on Black Friday

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Our consumer research shows most families have started thinking about Christmas this week.

'Now Black Friday is crossing the Atlantic, the amount spent on UK internet shopping on Friday could increase 10 per cent, with Amazon sales increasing by up to 30 per cent.

'Some people order early to guarantee delivery by Christmas and we’re sure internet shopping will be up on Friday - and that will be a bonus for some struggling retailers.'

Consumer website MoneySavingExpert said: 'American retailers offer customers massive reductions the day after Thanksgiving - and now the Black Friday trend has arrived in the UK.'

Last Black Friday, at its peak 
Amazon’s warehouses shipped more than 2.1million units in one day, 
representing about 1,124 tonnes of goods.

The firm has hired 10,000 extra staff to cope with demand.
