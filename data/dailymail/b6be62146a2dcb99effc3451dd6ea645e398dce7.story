Liverpool face a massive battle to persuade Raheem Sterling to sign an extension to his £30,000-a-week contract at Anfield.

Although Sterling has more than two years left on his deal, Liverpool are ready to open talks on an improved contract. Sterling, 19, earns £1.5million a year basic at Anfield and it is topped up with various appearance bonuses based on first-team football, but he is no rush to commit to a new contract.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers also has an issue with Mario Balotelli. He says the striker needs to start scoring and fast.

Rodgers said: ‘In terms of goals, he needs to improve, it is as simple as that. Any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes. At this moment, he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.’

Rodgers knows that Sterling, who has scored three times in the Barclays Premier League this season, is one of the biggest teenage talents in the game. Liverpool have struggled to get going this season following the departure of Luis Suarez for Barcelona and they have already been beaten four times.

Rodgers is a firm believer in rewarding progress with incremental increases to contracts for young players, but Liverpool are now competing at the very highest level.

Rodgers fears players can fall into a comfort zone when they are rewarded with massive pay rises after showing some promise.

Manchester United left back Luke Shaw, 19, signed a five-year contract worth a staggering £90,000-a-week when he moved from Southampton. Central defender Calum Chambers, also 19, is paid £40,000-a-week by Arsenal following his high-profile summer move from St Mary’s.

Shaw has yet to establish himself at United and was dropped to the England Under 21 squad yesterday for the European Championship play-off against Croatia.

On Thursday, England’s head coach Roy Hodgson claimed Sterling was one of the best players in the country after naming his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

Sterling is a huge part of Liverpool’s team and they are becoming increasingly reliant on the former QPR forward in the absence of Suarez and injured striker Daniel Sturridge.
