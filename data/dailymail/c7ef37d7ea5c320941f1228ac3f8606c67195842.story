The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty, Bradley Cooper couldn't keep his hands off Suki Waterhouse, Kate Beckinsale and Orlando Bloom flirted up a storm while Jude Law and Hugh Jackman chit-chatted with pals, flanked by Prince Michael of Kent, Lord Freddie Windsor and his wife, actress Sophie Winkleman.

No, this isn’t the glitzy after-party of a Hollywood premiere, but centre court at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships 2014.

Has there ever been such a starry crowd in suburban SW19? And how on earth has lawn tennis become such a fixture on the celebrity circuit?

Some stars are known to be avid fans -
 seven-time visitor Cliff Richard, Anna Wintour, Bradley Cooper all have 
form - but a few admitted to never having watched a match before.

The answer might lie in the energetic
 activities of championship sponsors Evian, whose public relations team 
has gone into overdrive persuading the stars to make the trip down to 
south London.

The Evian Live Young VIP suite kept 
the important people supplied with free Pimm's, table tennis, afternoon 
tea and Sugarpova (Maria Sharapova's line of sweets, don't you know).

Celebrities who passed through its 
portals include Ellie Goulding, Burberry models Jamie Campbell-Bower and
 new girlfriend Matilda Lowther (at the all-over-each-other stage, 
according to onlookers), Pixie Lott and Oliver Chesire and Douglas 
Booth, to name but a few.

Tennis fans the Middletons made their presence felt throughout the fortnight. Whilst Pippa once admitted she and her sister used to have to queue with the other mere mortals for tickets, this year they took their seats again in the royal box.

Kate attended twice with her husband Prince William while Pippa also went twice, once with their brother James and then with her parents and boyfriend, Nico.

Carole and Michael trumped their off spring by attending three times. They were on centre court on three different days - with one of them spent in the royal box thanks to their connections to the throne.

Not lucky charms: Prince William joined his wife on both of her visits. Unfortunately on their first trip, they saw Murray lose in his quarter final match against Dimitrov on July 2

June 30: Big Bang star Jim Parsons attends the Alize Cornet v Eugenie Bouchard match on centre court

July 2:  He returned to see his friend Bouchard defeat Angelique Kerber on court one in their quarter final match

July 3: Back on centre court, he watched as Bouchard beat Simona Halep to book her place in the final

July 5: In the women's final, Bouchard's luck ran out and he watched as she lost the title to Petra Kvitova

Support: Comedian Ricky Gervais joined Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo in the players' box on centre court to watch him win his third round match against Roberto Bautista Agut, left. After the match, he met the British number one to help him through his warm down on exercise bikes

Hugh Jackman watched Nadal win against Martin Klazan on June 24 and was 'thrilled' to get a picture with the champion afterwards

The X Men star returned to watch the men's final even though Nadal missed out on getting there

Meanwhile for others, befriending a top seed now seems to be the in-thing - comedian Ricky Gervais joined Andy Murray's support team this year even though the pair had previously never met.

The British number one explained in his BBC blog: 'There was a new face in the gym after Friday's match as comedian Ricky Gervais came along, as I'd invited him to sit in my player box... I'd never met him before, although we've had plenty of Twitter banter and I've watched all of his shows and his stand-up.'

He added that big names taking an interest in tennis can only be good for the sport as it creates more interest.

Last year Murray's famous fans, who cheered him on alongside his family, included comedian James Corden and cyclist Sir Chris Hoy. But he's not the only one with well-known friends. Women's finalist Eugenie Bouchard has a fan in the Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons. He said they have been friends for years and he watched her play four times during this year's tournament.

Two visits: Suki Waterhouse and boyfriend Bradley Cooper attend the semi-final match between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov on centre court on 4 July, left. He returned without her to watch the men's final on July 6 between Djokovic and Federer, right

Joining in: David Beckham and his mother Sandra carry on a Mexican wave as they attend on Saturday 28 June to watch victories from Nadal, Federer and Maria Sharapova

Having fun? She certainly didn't seem to be enjoying the match as much as her sporty husband

Too much excitement? John Bercow watched as Novak Djokovic took on Gilles Simon in week one, left, but he didn't seem quite as captivated during the men's final, right

This number of attendances was only beaten in the star stakes by the ever-present singer Cliff Richard - who attended seven times this year. Former newsreader Sir Trevor MacDonald, who is known to play tennis recreationally himself, was also there three times.

There's no doubt the standard of tennis at the moment would have been a draw for many. As if the old guard of Roger Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and last year's champion Murray aren't enough of a world class sporting spectacle, this year they were challenged by a number of rising talents including Grigor Dimitrov and Nick Kyrgios.

Meanwhile, there were a number of stars in the women's game to keep people entertained including eventual champion Petra Kvitova.

While once was enough for the Duchess of Cornwall and Samuel L Jackson, for other A-listers, much more than a single visit was needed. FEMAIL reveals which big names love Wimbledon the most...

Cliff Richard - sevenJim Parsons (Big Bang Theory) - fourSir Trevor McDonald - threeCarole and Michael Middleton - threeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - twoDavid Beckham - twoHugh Jackman  - twoPippa Middleton - twoBradley Cooper - twoCrown Prince Frederik and Princess Mary of Denmark - twoJohn Bercow - two

But it seems some of the celebrities weren't just there to see the tennis but to be seen at the tennis.

This certainly seemed to be the case for Victoria Beckham who didn't join her sporting husband when he attended the first Saturday of the tournament - so he took his mother instead.

But perhaps certain that more of the world would be watching on men's final day, she joined her husband in the royal box on that occasion, and made the most of it by showcasing a dress from her new collection.

Despite not cracking a smile throughout the whole day, she later Tweeted that she had 'so much fun'. She then posted a picture of her outfit pointing out it was part of her Spring/Summer 15 range.

For some of the stars, the hospitality might also have been more of a draw than the sport. Singers Pixie Lott and Ellie Goulding were among the stars pictured enjoying themselves being entertained in Evian's Wimbledon suite. They were able to grab food and drink, try their hand at table tennis - and of course be pictured by the gathered photographers.

Sophie Allard, evian Senior Brand Manager said they were delighted with how many celebs they had through their doors: 'We have been really pleased with how popular the evian Live young suite has been this year, we've had more A list celebrities than ever.

'This is the eighth year we have been encouraging the stars to have fun and play at The Championships, Wimbledon and they have obviously enjoyed themselves. We are already looking forward to next year!'
