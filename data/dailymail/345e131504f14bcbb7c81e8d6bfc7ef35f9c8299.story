Global warming is claimed to be already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning because of melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities.

Now experts have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of the bears’ penis bones.

This puts them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species.

Mammals such as otters have a penis bone, or baculum, which is thought to be a by-product of evolution, although experts are not sure.

Now, a team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, has found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with a less dense penile bone, New Scientist reported. 

They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, such as PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes.

Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs.

PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer.

Because they break down slowly, they can still be found in the Arctic, meaning that animals such as polar bears are especially at risk.

Together with a team from Canada, Dr Sonne examined buculum specimens from 279 polar bears that were born in north-east Greenland and Canada between 1990 and 2000.

They used X-rays to study the density of calcium in the bones and then compared their findings with regional pollutant data.

The team discovered a connection between low bone density and high PCB levels, but stressed that their findings are not strong enough to prove that the pollutants are the cause of the problem.

While experts are unsure of the exact purpose of the bacculum in polar bear mating, Dr Sonne thinks that a weaker bone could prove problematic, because if it breaks, it will likely stop a male from mating.

While no extensive studies in the wild have been done to understand the effect pollutants on polar bear populations - because they are difficult and expensive - Dr Sonne thinks chemicals have probably killed a lot of bears in recent decades.

He even believes PCBs, for example, may have cause changes to the bear’s genes.

It’s already been found that thin bears have higher levels of pollutants in their bodies, so some experts fear that hungry bears may be more vulnerable to the effects of chemicals such as PCBs.

In 2013, scientists uncovered a worrying trend in 'shrinking' penis bones in otters, possibly caused by chemicals.

Experts at Cardiff University and the Chemicals, Health and Environment Monitoring (CHEM) Trust suggested a link between hormone disrupting chemicals and problems with male reproductive health.

Experts studying the reproductive health of the mammals in England and Wales were concerned to find a decrease in the weight of otters' penis bones.

Other health problems in males included an increase in undescended testicles and cysts on sperm-carrying tubes.

Scientists recently warned that a a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps.

Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food.

Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year.

This means that by 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate.

Projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat, which is being damaged by man-made pollution, according to the study.

It found that sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems

The study, published in Plos One, used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears.
