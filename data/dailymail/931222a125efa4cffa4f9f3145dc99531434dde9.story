A phenomenal portrait of an interpretation of the Greek goddess Gaia marks the beginning of the final chapter in Kirsty Mitchell's Wonderland project.

The photographer, 36, form Surrey, dedicates her fantastical picture series to her late mother Maureen, an English teacher who spent her life inspiring generations of children
 with imaginative stories and plays.

Following Maureen's death from a 
brain tumour in 2008, Kirsty channelled her grief into her passion for 
photography.

The photographic series 
began as a small summer project but grew into an inspirational creative 
journey.

'This 
escapism grew into the concept of creating an unexplained storybook 
without words, dedicated to her [my mother], that would echo the 
fragments of the fairytales she read to me constantly as a child,' says 
the artist, who was named the first female Nikon UK Ambassador for Fine Art Photography in July.

The latest addition is a powerful and emotional vision of the Greek personification version of Mother Earth, Gaia, creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans and the Giants. It is called Gaia, The Birth Of An End, and is two metres high.

She wears a grand golden headdress which was handmade by Kirsty, who has a background in fashion and costume design. The piece took her over two and-a-half months to finish.

'I was heavily influenced by Inca 
gods, and my trip to Tibet in 2012, during which I had specifically 
collected traditional bells and tribal necklaces.

'I
 began by building up an entire new lower level to the piece, that would
 help surround the face and balance the enormous proportions of the top 
section.

'The headdress was 
entirely hand painted, dyed and beaded by myself and weighs so much, 
that it had to be wired to a wooden beam in my studio to take the weight
 off the model's head,' she says.

The base is made from solid plaster with metal mesh embedded into it for extra strength.

The photographer worked alongside make-up artist is Elbie Van Eeden to transform model Marianna Toka into the goddess.

'Wonderland is in its final phase,' she tells MailOnline.

'It has been running for four and a half years and is entirely self funded. The project's purpose is to create a extraordinary storybook without words.

'The characters are all my own creation; the costumes props and sets. I construct them like mini film sets in the woodlands around my home. Everything is real and real scale, and can take months to make.

'The characters are not based on anything that already exists - they are the result of my faded memories of the stories my mother read to me as a child, the original book illustrations, poems, paintings mixed up with dreams. I wanted to create pictures that people will project their own ideas on to, and lose themselves in.

'The project currently has 69 pictures in the collection, with another 10 coming. All the new pictures, the last 10, have been made and shot over the last 9 months, and we are now retuning with them, as well as the films. Each picture has a five-minute behind the scenes film made by FX Media.

'But we are also working on a full-length documentary about the whole series which will be released online at the very close of the series. I hope to complete everything by March next year.

Kirsty has dedicated the last four and a half years of her Wonderland project to her late mother who passed away in 2008

Kirsty wanted to create a body adornment for Gaia, which came in the form of these over sized necklace pieces. Every part has been handmade, beaded and painted by her aside from the central traditional necklace

'I named this first portrait Gaia, The Birth of An End, as it about the last seen character Gaia's transition from a mortal to her true goddess form.

'I named her after the Greek equivalent of our Mother Earth, and this picture represents her incarnation, (birth) surrounded by an explosion of vibrating, shimmering energy. Her character affects everything. As she changes so to will the landscape, creating a butterfly effect that sets in motion the end of the story.

'It was heavily influenced by how I see the human spirit; after losing my mother people often ask me what I imagine comes afterwards, and my only answer is my belief in an endless energy, the circle I feel we are all a part of. My mother is with me always, she is the earth, the rain, the wind in my hair was I walk to work. The body may cease, but I feel the vibrations of people continue, like ripples from a stone cast in a lake, and it was this power of spirit that I have tried to express within the picture.'
