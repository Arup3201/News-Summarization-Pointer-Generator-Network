Peter Dawson’s last major decision as chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club before he retires in September is likely to be his most far-reaching of all.

Brace yourself for the distinct possibility that at the start of next month he will announce live coverage of the Open Championship, from 2016 onwards, will be shown only on Sky.

Even now, the natural instinct is to believe the R&A will pull back from the brink and The Open will still be live on the BBC, if only over the weekend. They couldn’t take the biggest tournament in the sport away from the biggest audience, could they? Yet, few insiders in Abu Dhabi last week believed that will prove the outcome.

Once upon a time the BBC showed more than 30 days of live golf each year but it looks as if, to all intents and purposes, they are all but done. If so, it’s devastating news for the future of the game in this country.

Is it merely coincidence that participation levels have plummeted in tandem with the BBC’s retreat from showing the game on our screens? Clubs are closing up and down the country. Councils with budgets under pressure are wondering why they should continue to pour resources into municipal courses.

True, there are plenty of other reasons for this sad state of affairs, like the game takes too long for working men and women under 50, with young kids of their own to consider. But it would be naive not to believe there’s some correlation between the lack of golf on terrestrial television and the decline in numbers taking up the game.

Let’s say at this point, this is not a dig at Sky. They do a tremendous job if you’re a golf aficionado, with their comprehensive coverage of the European and PGA Tours. You might even be pleased if they snap up The Open, with their superior camera production values.

McIlory's triumph was available for all to see on BBC, but that all may change with the rumoured new TV deal

It’s the casual fans we are thinking about here, and the impressionable teenage lovers of sport who watch all games and are still seeking out their favourite. How on earth is the game going to appeal to this latter group if it’s never on free-to-air TV?

Think of Sir Nick Faldo. Channel-hopping late at night several decades ago, this then keen cyclist with no interest in golf came across the Masters — and look how that ended up.

The R&A’s professed mandate is to grow the game but it’s hard to see how taking live coverage from the BBC squares with that. Could they not do a similar deal like the one with the Masters, whereby they share live coverage at the weekend? I understand there’s little enthusiasm at Sky for such an arrangement. Not unreasonably, if they’re giving the R&A a huge pot of gold, they want exclusive live rights.

Undoubtedly, heads were turned at the R&A in 2013 when the United States Golf Association, their American equivalent, took the US Open away from its traditional broadcast partner and gave it to the relative newcomer, Fox, in a deal worth £800million over 12 years.

At 13 years of age, Sir Nick Faldo was inspired to play golf while watching the 1971 Masters on television 

But the differences are marked. Fox is still a free-to-air television channel and, in any case, the game is shown every weekend on such television stations in America. It doesn’t need any more exposure.

Will the R&A break with more than a half-century of tradition? We will find out soon enough. But let’s hope that, even at this 11th hour, they move back from the precipice.

To think, the announcement might even come at the same time as the world No 1 Rory McIlroy is in the witness stand in a Dublin courtroom, where some sharp lawyers will be trawling his financial affairs through the mud.

Apologies for coming over all doom-laden following the dramatic start to the season in Abu Dhabi last week. But the early days of February are shaping up to be bleak indeed for the Royal and Ancient game.

Darren Clarke is favourite to be appointed Europe’s Ryder Cup captain in mid-February 

Not long to wait now until Darren Clarke is appointed Europe’s Ryder Cup captain. The five-man committee that will choose Paul McGinley’s successor are due to meet in mid-February, with an announcement expected the same evening. 

Given Clarke has the backing of all the leading players it is inconceivable the committee would overlook such unanimity and bestow the honour on someone else. As one of the great characters of the European game over the past 20 years and a formidable Ryder Cup player in the past, Clarke deserves his chance, too. 

QUOTE OF THE WEEK 

‘Ball-striking, I don’t think I could have done much more. I exceeded my own expectations in that regard, so it all bodes well for the new season.’

Rory McIlroy, after a runner-up finish in Abu Dhabi left him with this record from his last six European Tour starts: 1,1,1,2,2,2. Next is the Dubai Desert Classic — where he achieved his first Tour win in 2009.
