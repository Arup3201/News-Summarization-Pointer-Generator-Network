Jimmy Anderson was handed the perfect conditions to exact his revenge on an India side who are trying to get him expelled from this Investec series. But when push came to shove, a golden opportunity was wasted.

Anderson was not short of motivation on the first day of the second Test with a potential four-match suspension hanging over him thanks to India’s insistence that he ‘abused and pushed’ Ravindra Jadeja in the Trent Bridge pavilion.

Yet even though Anderson, who hotly disputes the charge, broke two significant records, England were left wondering what might have been as India were allowed to score at least a hundred more than they should.

VIDEO Great feeling to score a century at Lord's - Rahane  

England
 have spent the summer dreaming of the sort of lively pitch prepared for
 them at Lord’s but, even though the famously independent groundsman 
Mick Hunt granted their wish, they did not have the nous to take 
advantage of it.

It is 
bounce and carry that England want from pitches more than seam movement 
but they will never have a better chance of skittling opponents on the 
first day of a Lord’s Test on a rare green surface most bowlers would 
die for.

Instead, India were
 allowed to recover from the depths of 145 for seven to close on 290 for
 nine as Ajinkya Rahane, one of the new breed of Indian batsmen, took 
the attack to England and left them desperately needing to bat well.

In truth, Anderson 
was the least culpable of an England attack who bowled too short and 
wide for all but a middle session when they took four wickets for 67 and
 finally located the right line and lengths for the conditions.

Anderson
 became both the leading Test wicket-taker in England and then in Lord’s
 history with his first and second wickets, ending up with four victims 
in all after Alastair Cook had won what turned out to be an important 
toss.

Resistance: India's Ajinkya Rahane moved passed his half-century to frustrate England's bowlers

Bat raised: Rahane (right) acknowledges the Lord's crowd has he scores a half-century

Smashed: Rahane gladly accepts yet another short ball from Plunkett and dispatches it to the boundary

But Anderson will have
 been disappointed both by his bowling before lunch and after tea and 
the fact that he was not able to aim a single delivery at either of his 
Trent Bridge accusers, Jadeja and India captain MS Dhoni.

It
 was left to Stuart Broad to dismiss Dhoni, too high at six in these 
conditions, and then Moeen Ali to claim Jadeja during an English purple 
patch when India’s initial stubborn defence looked to be counting for 
little.

And when Stuart 
Binny was incorrectly given lbw by Australian umpire Bruce Oxenford – 
the lack of DRS costing India again – England were on the brink of the 
position of dominance they have craved during their long winless run.

But
 Rahane, highly rated by India coach Duncan Fletcher for his fighting 
qualities, joined forces with the tailender who England could not budge 
at Trent Bridge in Bhuvneshwar Kumar to change the course of the day.

England,
 barely believably, resorted to Liam Plunkett’s flat pitch enforcer 
tactics to little effect as Rahane and Kumar added 90 for the eighth 
wicket and then Rahane put on another 40 in rapid time with Mohammed 
Shami.

Only when Anderson 
took a superb one-handed return catch to send back Rahane for 103 off 
154 balls, his second 50 coming off just 50 balls, could England breathe
 a sigh of relief at not totally squandering their advantage.

Sparks
 were expected to fly here with relations between these teams at a low 
ebb because of the accusation levelled by India against Anderson and 
then the counter claim thrown back at Jadeja by an indignant England.

Yet
 there was barely a cross word exchanged all day, with any fighting 
between the teams saved, for now, for Tuesday’s preliminary ICC 
disciplinary hearing that will be heard by Australian judicial 
commissioner Gordon Lewis.

All
 eyes were on Anderson after Cook had taken the plunge and decided to 
bowl but it was another England player who has endured a difficult week 
who made the initial impression on a sun-soaked Lord’s crowd.

Gary
 Ballance escaped disciplinary action after pictures of him shirtless 
and the worse for wear in a Nottingham nightclub emerged on Wednesday 
but he was seeing the ball clearly yesterday as he pouched the two smart
 catches that gave England their only two pre-lunch wickets.

Saying nothing: Cook keeps his reaction muted after Prior missed a golden chance for a wicket

Tweaker: Moeen Ali jumps for joy after claiming the wicket of Ravindra Jadeja

Massive wicket: Stuart Broad shows how much the wicket of MS Dhoni means to the England players

Frustrated: Broad throws his head back as Rahane and Bhuvneshwar Kumar fought back

Thankfully
 Ballance, who was reminded of his responsibilities by coach Peter 
Moores, resisted the urge, a la Andrew Flintoff and Sourav Ganguly, to 
take off his shirt again and wave it around his head in celebration.

India
 could manage only 73 runs in the first session and six fewer between 
lunch and tea but all that changed as 150 runs were clattered in the 
final session and any confidence England had garnered was sapped from 
them.

Cook was hindered by 
the afternoon absence of Plunkett, who had a tight hamstring, and the 
continuing travails of Matt Prior, who dropped another two catches 
before lunch to make it six missed opportunities in all this summer.

Prior
 seems to have a problem moving to his right, where he has had both 
achilles and thigh injuries, and a wicket-keeper batsman who has been a 
very good cricketer for England is fighting now against the ravages of 
time.

England, meanwhile, are now in a much bigger second Test fight than they should be.
