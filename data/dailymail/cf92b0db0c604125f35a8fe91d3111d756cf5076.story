It started as a conversation about how to photograph China's famous golden monkeys, and ended with Prince William pledging to dress up as a tree. 

During his wildlife conservation visit to China, the Duke of Cambridge visited a photographer to learn about how he managed to capture such close up pictures of wildlife.

And when photography enthusiast Xi Zhinong told the Prince he often dressed up as a tree so he could get close to the animals, the second in line to the throne pledged to do the same.

Prince William has pledged to dress up as a tree on his next visit to China so that he can go out with photographer and conservationist Xi Zhinong to photograph rare Yunnan Golden Haired monkeys

The Prince said when he next returned to Yunnan Xishuangbanna he would join Xi on a photography exhibition and also don the same disguise to photograph the endangered Golden Haired Monkeys of Yunnan, according to People's Daily Online.

It was pledged during the Prince's tour of the Far East, which he used to foster UK business links as well as raise awareness of the dangers of the illegal trade in wildlife.

Golden haired monkeys of Yunnan are native to the forests of China and are highly endangered - with less than 2,000 estimated to be living in the wild.

While able to withstand plunging temperatures and even snow, the species is in danger because their habitats are slowly disappearing and their distinctive appearance has made them a key target for illegal hunters.

Yunnan golden haired monkeys are native to China but they are believed to be less than 2,000 in the wild 

They are also something of a mystery because they were first discovered by scientists in the 1890s, then lost and thought to be extinct until 1962. 

The monkeys are herbivores and give birth every two or three years. China has launched a conservation programme to try and protect the species.

Xi Zhinong is a Chinese wildlife photographer as well as an environmentalist. 

Between 1992 and 1996 Xi went to Baimaxue Mountain National Nature Reserve to raise awareness of the Golden Haired Monkey.

He also hoped that by sharing photos of the monkeys and how they lived he could protect the natural habitat of the animals, in a strip of primeval forest.

Prince William spoke to photographer Xi about his work and learned how he disguises himself to take pictures

After being discovered in the 1890s the Yunnan Golden Haired monkey did not appear again until 1962

During his visit, Xi presented Prince William with two photography collections, 'Wild China' and 'The Spirit of Life'.

Prince William was in China last week for a wildlife conservation visit. 

His visit was the highest profile Royal visit since the Queen toured the country in 1986, and gave the Prince the chance to meet wildlife experts and conservationists. He used the tour to condemn the trade in illegal wildlife and products, such as ivory, and called upon China to become a world leader.

Prince William was intrigued by the golden haired monkeys and asked how close-up pictures were possible

Golden haired monkeys are native to China and mainly spend their time in the forest canopy 

During his time in the country Prince William visited Beijing and featured on a television campaign organised by WildAid and aimed at raising awareness of the impact of the trade in rhino horn and ivory.  

The tour ended however with a PR disaster when the Prince was allowed to visit an Elephant rescue centre, just a few yards from an arena where elephants play football, dance and do tricks for tourists. 

Prince William's visit was also seen as an opportunity to create links between the two countries, and he met President Xi Jinping.  

The end of Prince William's tour was branded somewhat a PR disaster after he visited an elephant sanctuary yards from where the animals perform tricks for audiences in a type of circus, condemned by campaigners
