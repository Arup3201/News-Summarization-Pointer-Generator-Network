Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama when asked about her voting history on Monday night during a debate.

Grimes claimed there's 'no reluctancy' on her part to reveal her vote while asserting that she has a constitutional right not to answer questions about it. She then chided the debate moderator for having the audacity to violate the sanctity of the ballot box by pressuring her to reveal her vote.

'This is a matter of principle. Our Constitution grants, here in Kentucky, the constitutional right for privacy at the ballot box, for a secret ballot,' she told the debate's moderator, Kentucky Tonight host Bill Goodman.

Obama who?: Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama in the last two elections when pressed to reveal her vote on Monday night during a U.S. Senate debate

'You have that right, Sen. [Mitch] McConnell has that right, every Kentuckian has that right. And as secretary of state, the chief election official, I'm tasked with overseeing and making sure that we're enforcing all of our election laws and I've worked very closely, especially with the members of our military to ensure that the privacy at the ballot box...'

At that point Goodman butted in to get clarification on her position. 

'So your reluctancy is a matter of principle?' he asked?

'I am not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or other side, or for members of the media. I'll protect that right for every Kentuckian.'

Goodman again pressed Grimes to say whether or not she voted for Obama, but she wouldn't budge.

'Again, you have that right, Sen. McConnell has that right, every Kentuckian has the right for privacy at the ballot box.

'If I as chief election official, Bill, don't stand up for that right, who in Kentucky will?' she asked.

Grimes is competing in Kentucky's Senate race this fall against incumbent McConnell, who also serves at the upper chamber's minority leader. If Republicans win a majority of seats in November, McConnell will likely become the Senate majority leader.

Polls have Grimes and McConnell neck and neck and tonight was the pair's only debate against each other before the election next month.

Grimes opponent, sitting Sen. Mitch McConnell, had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight's debate. McConnell said he voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Both men are Republicans

Grimes has been loathe to tie herself to Obama in any way during the race, despite being a member of his political party, in order to boost her odds of getting elected in Kentucky, where the president is incredibly unpopular.

Obama is less liked in Kentucky than almost anywhere in the country and has an approval rating of 29 percent there, according to a recent CNN poll.

As such, Grimes likes to say she's a 'Clinton Democrat,' not an Obama Democrat, and supports the policies of former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former Obama administration official. 

Asked what the difference between a Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat is at tonight's debate, Grimes explained it's 'growing the middle class the right way and that's by making sure that we are building from the foundation up.'

At an editorial board meeting with the Louisville Courier-Journal Grimes declined to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 or 2012 multiples times, arguing that her vote was irrelevant because the president's name is not on the ballot.

She also made the claim, as she did tonight, that she didn't need to share her vote with Kentuckians because it's private information.

Grimes' vote is actually public information, assuming she was telling the truth in 2012 when she told a local newspaper that she planned to support her party's nominee, Obama, though she is unwilling to admit that now.

McConnell, for one, had no problem sharing his vote in both recent presidential elections during tonight's debate, without even being asked.

The Republican leader said he voted for Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Both men are Republicans.

'And by the way, in 2012, 116 out of 120 Kentucky counties agreed with my judgement that we might be in better shape now had Mitt Romney been elected,' McConnell added.
