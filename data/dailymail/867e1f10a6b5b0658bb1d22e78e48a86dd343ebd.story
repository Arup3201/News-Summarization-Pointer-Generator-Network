Four men appeared in court today facing charges over the traceability of meat following last yearâ€™s investigation into the horse meat scandal. 

They are said to have breached food regulations that say meat should be traceable from field to fork.

They appeared in two pairs at Westminster Magistratesâ€™ Court, and were sent to Southwark Crown Court, with their next appearance to be on April 28. Unconditional bail was renewed.

Two slaughterhouse bosses face charges over claims that they broke laws governing the traceability of horse meat.

Peter Boddy, 64, who owns the business in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, and David Moss, 53, the manager, are accused of failing to comply with the traceability requirements of horses slaughtered at and sold from the premises.

Boddy, of East Hey Head Farm, Todmorden, faces two counts of failing to comply with food traceability requirements, as does Moss, of Higher Moss, Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, who is also accused of making a false instrument. 

It was indicated that Boddy would plead not guilty. There was no indication from Moss. It is not being alleged that the horse meat was being sold as another meat.

Two men and a company appeared in relation to the alleged mislabelling of goat meat products intended for sale.

Dafydd Raw-Rees, 66, the owner and Food Business Operator of Farmbox Meats Limited in Aberystwyth and Colin Patterson, 43, the company representative, are accused of mislabelling goat meat as either lamb or mutton for the purposes of sale. 

The pair, both of Tyne Parc, Llandre, Bow Street, Dyfed, are charged with 19 offences contrary to the

Food Safety Act 1990 and one of failing to comply with traceability requirements of meat sold by the company, contrary to regulation 4 of the General Food Regulations 2004. 

It was indicated that both would plead not guilty. The company is said to be in administration.
