An Arkansas man in custody for allegedly killing his pregnant girlfriend claims he has no memory of assaulting her.

Douglas True, 21, reportedly dialed 911 for Fort Smith Police at around 11:52 a.m. on Sunday, asking that they come to a home on the 2900 block of South 66th Street.

He waved them into the driveway, and upon entering the house police discovered the body of Briana Butler stabbed to death and lying on the bathroom floor. She was 22 years old and seven months pregnant.

Police say Briana Butler was found stabbed to death seven months into a pregnancy this Sunday after a fight with her boyfriend

Douglas True, 21, told police that he had fought with Butler but had no memory of stabbing her to death

Butler's daughter Bonnie, 2, was discovered sleeping in a nearby room with minor facial injuries, KFSM reports.

The toddler was immediately transported to a local hospital and should make a full recovery. 

Upon searching the home police recovered a knife they believe was used in the homicide, and it was later confirmed that lacerations on her throat and torso were consistent with knife wounds.

True was arrested on suspicion of two charges of capital murder for her and her unborn child. He has been transferred to Sebastian County Detention Center to be held without bond.

Police say True called his mother to say he'd done a terrible thing and would spend his life in prison

'True was advised of his rights and gave a statement admitting that he and Butler got into an argument that escalated to a physical altercation,' according to an affidavit.

'True stated that he was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after that. True said that he got up in the middle of the night and found Butler's body in the bathroom and went back to the couch and passed out.'

The next morning he woke up, cut a cast off his arm, then called his mother to tell her he'd done something bad and would spend the rest of his life in prison.

Chief deputy prosecutor Linda Ward told the Times Record the investigation will continue before charges are filed.

Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler, told WHBS that Bonnie had been an attentive and conscientious mother.

Because Butler was pregnant, as this sonogram shows, True is being charged with two murders

'No human being deserves to be done like that,' said Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler. 'To take your anger and rage out on another person and just totally take
 them out, I mean that's just, cowardly right there'

Eyewitness Barry Wayne, who saw True's arrest, said that a niece living in the complex where the crime took palce told him she was scared something had happened.

'She had never been in nothing like this before,' he said, 'I seen
 three or four police cars and then I was sitting on the porch, and I 
seen a gentlemen in the back and they said he had murdered her.'

He said the girl would move out soon.

'You never know what’s going on in a person’s mind, so you always got
 to be careful,' he said, 'You never know what’s going on with that 
person.'
