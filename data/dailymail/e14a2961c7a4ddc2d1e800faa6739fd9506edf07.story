A senior police chief apologised today to the devastated father of student gunned down in an apparent 'hate crime' attack after he learnt his son had been brutally murdered through Facebook.

Anuj Bidve, 23, was shot at point-blank 
range after he and a group of friends strayed into a deprived area of 
Salford, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of Boxing Day.

The murder of the Indian student is being treated by detectives at Greater Manchester Police (GMP) as a hate crime which may have been racially motivated.

Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley, who is in charge of the investigation, made her apology today after being forced to confirm that Subhash Bidve, the victim's father, read a post on the social networking site before officers were able to get in touch.

Gunned down: Anuj Bidve, pictured with a friend, had 'dreamed' of going to the UK. He was shot dead in Salford, Manchester, in the early hours of Boxing Day after a gunman asked him for the time

She said: 'That is not the way anyone
should have to find out something so devastating and we completely 
understand how upset the family are.

'Social networking is instantaneous 
and we have no control over when and what people post on such sites, but
no one should hear such tragic news in this way.'

His father Subhash Bidve had today 
spoken of his complete devastation after hearing the crushing news his 
son had been killed over the social networking site, not through 
official channels.

Police said a 16-year-old boy and two
17-year-old boys arrested over the murder have been released on bail 
pending further inquiries while two men, aged 19 and 20, remain in 
custody on suspicion of murder.

Mr Bidve told BBC Radio 5Live: 
‘Nobody official from the UK Government or consulate or the Indian 
Government called us and told us about this.

Victim: Anuj Bidve, who had a 'heart of gold'

‘I
am really surprised because they confiscated his phone and must have 
known his father's or mother's number. They could have called us and 
told us what had happened to him.’

Anuj had arrived in the UK in September to study micro-electronics at Lancaster University.

Speaking about the last week’s events Mr Bidve, from Pune, Maharashtra, said the family were desperate to return his son’s body to India.

He
said: ‘The last four days we have been feeling so much trauma because 
we are yet to know as to when Anuj can come back. We are really worried.
All family members are worried about it.

‘Everyone at home, they are all shattered and waiting for his remains to do all religious things.'

Lancaster
University has already said it will pay for Anuj's body to be 
repatriated while Greater Manchester Police said today they were offering a 
£50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
those responsible for the brutal murder.

Det Chief Supt Mary Doyle, leading 
the murder inquiry, said: 'It is an extremely unusual, savage and 
motiveless attack, an absolutely horrific crime, which is why we are 
taking the step of issuing it (the reward) a bit earlier than we 
normally would.

'We absolutely understand the need to
take whoever is responsible for this off the streets. That's the reason
we are issuing it now at such an early stage.'

The gunman is thought to have asked 
Anuj the time before shooting him and one tribute page set up on 
Facebook claimed: 'He was killed for not answering a simple question - 
What's the time?'

Anuj was earlier described by his family as a 'loving son, a super-caring brother and first and forever a friend for many.'

Peace marches in response to his murder are due to take place in Salford, Lancaster and in India in the new year.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday,
Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said detectives were not ruling out
that the shooting might have been racially motivated.

He said: 'A racially-motivated crime is when there is actual evidence to show that it is the actual motivation for the crime.'

He said a hate crime, 'by definition, is something that a community or anyone perceives is racially motivated'.

Yesterday locals left tributes to Mr Bidve at the scene in Ordsall, an area known for high crime levels.

A note addressed to Mr Bidve and 
attached to a small bouquet of flowers, said: ‘Evil and mindless people 
took your life away for nothing.

‘We are local residents who are so 
saddened and sickened at this senseless act (that) we don’t think living
here will ever be the same.

Devastation: Tributes have been left at the scene where the student was killed

‘We send our condolences to your 
family and friends and hope you don’t blame us all. Rest in peace Anuj. 
God bless you – unlike your murderer who will rot in hell.’

The killing has disgusted members of 
the community in the tough inner city suburb, which has found itself the
subject of worldwide condemnation on news and social networking sites 
since the killing.

Norman Owen, leader of Salford’s Liberal Democrats, agreed Mr Bidve’s murder had shamed the city.

‘This is a disgrace,’ he said. ‘What 
kind of city are we living in when we have a young man walking on the 
street with a gun and is ready to use it. We are being dragged down by 
this issue and the police have got to get into gun crime.’

The Lancashire University electronics student had been approached by the killer and another man as he walked with friends to Christmas sales at 1.35am on Boxing Day.

Murder probe: Police cordon off the scene following the random shooting in the early hours of the morning

After Indian-born Mr Bidve, from a wealthy Delhi family, 
fell to the pavement, his two attackers fled into the night.

Mr Bidve – who had not been drinking – had been walking with nine 
friends through a rough inner-city district in Salford, Manchester, 
after leaving their nearby hotel to queue for early morning bargains.

The group were making their way into the city centre on foot using a GPS 
system on Mr Bidve’s phone when they strayed into Ordsall, an area known
for high crime levels.

His friends desperately tried to give him first aid as armed police arrived at the scene and launched a widespread manhunt.

A police
source said the youths arrested were ‘connected to the shooting’ but were not 
believed to be the gunman and his accomplice.

Witness Sheetal Patel, 25, said she held Mr Bidve’s hand as he lay dying in the street.
The cake maker had been driving past when the student’s friends waved down her car.

Probe: Forensic officers search for clues into the shooting which happened at around 1.35am this morning. It was unclear what the motive was for the killing

‘When we arrived at the scene, the guy was lying on the floor,’ she 
said. ‘I was holding his hand, but he was alive. 

'He
was making noises. 
All I was saying is, “You’re very strong, you’re going to be all right”.
We just kept on trying to keep him breathing and to make him know that 
we were there.

'There was one guy holding Anuj’s head trying to put 
pressure on the wound. And there was another guy who was on the phone to
the police.’

Miss Patel said that ‘he was shot in the head, but the bullet didn’t go 
through his head’ and there did not appear to be an exit wound.

‘We all 
thought he was going to live,’ she added.

A statement from Mr Bidve’s family said: ‘Anuj was a loving 
son, a super caring brother and first and forever friend for many.

‘He valued his relationships and put them over anything else. He was the
first person you could call when in trouble. Anuj loved to travel and 
loved his food. He loved to cook.

‘He could easily bring a smile on anyone’s face with his innocent jokes.
He loved playing football. He enjoyed his life and is an inspiration 
for us to live life to its fullest.

‘His passing will not only leave a void in our lives, but in the hearts of all those who knew him.’

McDonalds murder investigation: The man was stood outside the fast food restaurant with another man when two people walked over to them. Shortly afterwards the victim, aged in his 20s, was shot

Mr Bidve was the postgraduate representative on the Lancaster University Indian Society Committee.
Society president Sonakshi Saran said: ‘He was killed for not answering a
simple question. Did he deserve this? Did his family deserve such pain 
and such loss?’

She said students and friends planned a candle-lit peace march on January 2 at the spot where he was killed.

Mr Bidve had been visiting Manchester in a group of nine male and female friends.

Greater Manchester Police said the shooting was a truly ‘awful’ attack 
and pledged to ‘leave no stone unturned’ in the hunt for the killer.

Armed officers were on the streets of Ordsall yesterday conducting searches.

Officers holding what were believed to be semi-automatic machine guns 
were seen ordering three men to stand against a wooden fence with their 
arms outstretched.
