The 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 is not yet available to the public, and already the car is having some possibly major problems.

While testing out the convertible model of the car in Jackson, Michigan on a rainy day, the car spun out on the highway and hit another car, crashing into a nearby wire fence that slashed through the car.

This is the second accident for a 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06, with the coupe version crashing while undergoing a high-speed test on Germany’s grueling Nürburgring.

Crash: A 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 convertible was in a car crash (above) on a highway in Jackson, Michigan

Not looking good: The car spun out and hit another car, then going into a nearby wire fence

Nice model: This is the second crash one of the Corvettes (above, new) has suffered, with the coupe crashing in Germany during a speed test

An eyewitness told Corvette Blogger, 'The vette spun out and took another vehicle with it through a cable wire median, shredding the vehicle to the point where the cable almost came through the drivers seat, and ... ended up facing backwards on the opposite side of the barrier that it originally spun out from.'

Luckily neither of the drivers were injured in the crash. 

This all happens as the car is set to go in to production in order to be available to buy in early 2015.

Sliced: The wire fence tore throw almost the entire car

Still moving forward: The cars are expected to go on sale in early 2015, and will be priced starting at $54,000

On the Chevrolet site, the new car is described as, 'the closest link yet between Corvettes built for racing and the road.' 

Vehicle pricing starts at $54,000.
