Jihadis should wage holy war on Syria, the daughter of Muslim hate preacher Anjem Choudary urged in a poisonous tweet echoing her father's radical views.

Hediyah Mehraj, 16, blasted humanitarian aid, calling instead for authoritarian rule in the country now in its third year of civil unrest.

Under the pseudonym Heidyag Bint Anjem, she said: 'The ultimate way to help Syria is not Muslim aid or temporary convoys, rather it is to take authority via Jihad and implement Allah's law.'

Extremist: Hediyah Mehraj echoed the radical beliefs of her father Anjem Choudary in an explosive tweet

The teenager has also attacked the lifestyle in London, where she lives. She tweeted: 'Everywhere u look u see promescuity and sexual exploitation in this 
kufr [non-Muslim] land, its so hard to walk outside without feeling 
sick.'

She also tweeted her dad saying: '@anjemchoudary so true, may allah bring islam to syria soon,' according to the Daily Mirror.

Her profile, which stated 'Islam is superior and will never be surpassed', has since been deleted.

Hediyah has been berated for her extremist comments, following in the footsteps of her father.

Anjem Choudary is the former leader of Islam4UK, which was made illegal on January 14, 2010 by the Terrorism Act, for inciting extremism and terrorism.

Radical: Choudary adamantly promotes Shari'ah law in Britain. His rules would see the Queen wear a burka

Earlier this year he declared 
fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', while praising his alleged 
attacker, Michael Adebolajo, as 'a nice man'.

Filmed in an office near his mosque in north-east London, he would not denounce the soldier's death.

'So
as an adult non-Muslim, whether he is part of the Army or not part of 
the Army, if he dies in a state of disbelief then he is going to go to 
the hellfire. That’s what I believe so I’m not going to feel sorry for 
non-Muslims.'

Choudary went on that the British Government is to blame for Drummer Rigby's death, which is a 'drop in the ocean'.

He said murdered Lee Rigby, right, would 'burn in hellfire' but praised alleged attacker Michael Adebolajo

'I
think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are 
radicalising these youths, which is really the British government.

'You
need to take into account the hundreds of thousands of incidents of 
people slaughtered, of weddings bombed, of Muslims tortured, of innocent
people kept in prison for over ten years.'

He also attacked the charity Help for 
Heroes, which helps care for injured British soldiers, saying they 
cannot be heroes because they 'shoot children in Afghanistan'.

The radical has previously applauded the 9/11 terrorists attacks and London bombings.

According to the Daily Mirror, Hediyah made her relationship to Choudary clear in a tweet and a link on her Ask.fm account, which has also been deleted.
