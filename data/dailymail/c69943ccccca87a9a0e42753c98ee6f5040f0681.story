Alexander Jentzsch, the 27-year-old son of Scientology president Heber Jentzsch, died last week after complaining of a fever the night before, leaving his grieving mother, Karen de la Carriere, without any closure.

For Ms de la Carriere left the Church some two years ago, and because of her decision, she said her son was forced to disconnect from her - an act which she has labelled 'savage.'

Ms de la Carriere revealed to MailOnline the tragic life of her only child, saying: ‘For two years, he was gone from my life, and a few weeks ago his life fell apart…and now he’s dead.'

She described how her son's wife was allegedly pressured to have an abortion, triggering a downward spiral that ended with his death last week.

Ms de la Carriere, who is the premiere collector for recently passed contemporary artist Thomas Kinkade, said in an emotional interview that she tried in vain to visit her son’s body at the Los Angeles County Morgue.

But even that was impossible, because 
she was excommunicated by the Church of Scientology and deemed an SP – a
 suppressive person.

A mother's grief: Karen de la Carriere said her son disowned in 2010 after she left Scientology

She wept as she said: ‘I put in 35 years, I lived on rice and beans, the discipline and the savagery…there’s no mercy, there’s no benevolence. The Church of Scientology has no charity.’

She said that her son’s last months were troubled.

He had been living with his wife Andrea in Dallas, where both worked for Sea Org.

Sometime within the span of two years when Alexander shunned his mother, he had been in a bad car accident and injured his back. The accident required him to take prescription pain medication.

Ms de la Carriere said she only found out because of her son’s autopsy.

She said: ‘I was never told and he could never tell me because I’m shunned.'

Financially struggling and recently separated from his wife, Alexander moved back to Los Angeles and moved in with his in-laws, continuing to take painkillers.

Ms de la Carriere said it was leaked to her that her son had a breathing problem.

Rather than take Alexander to a doctor, she said that his in-laws performed a touch-assist on him.

‘A touch-assist is for bruised knees,’ Ms de la Carriere said, ‘breathing difficulty is medicine.'

Alexander’s father-in-law discovered him unresponsive around 8am Tuesday morning.

A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office said that he was found with multiple prescription medications, as well as NyQuil. 

She said there were clues that her son’s life was crumbling, though she hadn’t seen or heard from him in two years. ‘I know as a mom how much his life was falling apart,’ the art collector said.

'He had no job, he had no father, he had no mom, his wife and him were separated. He had a back injury that required drugs. This is the kind of destruction that comes with the shunning policy.’

She added: 'He always called himself "the boy with no dad."'

Alexander, she said, grew up without seeing Herber. Ms de la Carrier explained: ‘Alexander’s chip on his shoulder was he never saw his father. In 16 years, he may have seen his father 9 times.

'His father didn’t call for Christmas, he couldn’t call to wish him happy birthday. Alexander had a huge sadness, and would say "My father doesn’t love me," but he didn’t understand that he is in prison.'

Heber Jentzsch has not been seen in public for nearly a decade, one of several high-profile Scientology members removed from the public eye.

The wife of church leader David Miscavige, Michelle 'Shelly' Barnett, has not been seen since 2007.

She said that this is a ‘deeply embarrassing’ situation for the Church.

She said: ‘Let me explain the why: The church of Scientology is a self-protection mechanism. The church must survive because they think they are the greatest good for the greatest number. Therefore, anything you do to anyone is fair game.

'You can destroy an enemy, you can cheat them, you can steal. This is fair game policy.’

In the end, she said she is not looking to gain anything. ‘I just wanted to look at my son’s body for fifteen seconds before he was cremated,’ the mother said.

She said that she has a short-term tactical attack, of which she would say no more. But for the long term?

‘On the longer range,’ she said, ‘I will continue to whistle-blow and I will continue to shed light. I was in for 35 years. I will try to right a wrong, but my motivation is truly not revenge because I didn’t see my dead son’s body. My motivation is – this has to stop, we have to create change. And even if it stops people giving them more money, it turns people off so they don’t want to contribute, then that is forward progress.’

In an explosive tell-all published on
 a friend’s blog in 2010, Ms de la Carriere revealed her struggle with 
the religion, and explained how Alexander, who was born in 1984, was 
inculcated with the beliefs of Scientology from infancy.

According to 
her, Alexander was a member of Sea Org for more than a decade.

She
 also wrote of the policies surrounding Scientology and reproduction. 
Alexander’s wife, Andrea, became pregnant in 2007.

She wrote in the 
post: ‘Pressure is brought to bear for an abortion. It is done skilfully
 – no heavy threats, but both are taken off post to look at "the 
greatest good…" In the end, Andrea had an abortion and they were 
returned to post.'

Ms de la
 Carriere said in a 2011 interview that she and then-husband Heber had 
to petition for a second child, a newly-ordained rule at the time.

Rewarding: Ms de la Carriere said: 'Heber (far right) would give out awards to people who donated megabucks to the Church'

She
 said she wanted a girl. ‘A new [rule] had come out that you had to petition to
 have a baby,' she explained. 'And along with the petition, you were to 
name why you should be allowed to have a baby.’

Ms
 de la Carriere said that though she and her husband petitioned for 
three months, their petition was denied. She also said that her husband 
was beaten for making the request.

She again became pregnant three years later. 

A
 spokesperson from the Church of Scientology International told 
MailOnline: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Heber Jentzsch
 and his entire family during this difficult time.

‘The
 Church takes offense at the irresponsible and false claims from 
excommunicated self-promoters who are sadly exploiting private family 
matters for their own personal financial gain.’

Ms
 de la Carriere told the Village Voice: ‘The dead body of the son of the
 president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for
 days, and they didn’t tell me because I’m a declared SP.’

Leaving: Karen, back right, left the Church of Scientology in 2010 and said her son cut all ties with her

She told RadarOnline.com that Alexander’s wife, Andrea, refuses to let her see her son’s body.

When
 Ms de la Carriere sent a friend over to their home with a letter for 
Andrea, the friend was turned away with the message, ‘All communication 
goes through the Office of Special Affairs.’

The
 mother told the Village Voice that the Church created a ‘hate website’ 
about her, and coerced Alexander to cut all ties with her.

She said that he was spoon fed what to tell her, including the words: ‘Never phone me, never e-mail me. Until you get your s*** together, we can have no communication.  'Until then, we are disconnected.’

The mother added: ‘For two years, he disconnected from me, and now he’s dead.’

She found out three days after the fact that her son had died from former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder.  Apparently, Andrea had told some of her Scientology friends on Facebook about Alexander’s death, and the news eventually tricked down to Rinder, who currently lives in Florida, RadarOnline.com reported.

Once told by Mr Rinder, Ms de la Carriere called the coroner’s office, which solidly confirmed her son’s death.

Hollywood split: The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, pictured

The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise.

In light of the rumours that Cruise’ devotion to Scientology- and his supposed desire to enroll their daughter Suri in one of the religion’s intense boot camps - was one of the main causes for their split,  two senior Church administrators sent a panicked email giving followers advice on how to counter the negative press storm.

The letter comes the day after one of the most noted 'defectors' from the religion predicted that Cruise's latest divorce could be the ‘biggest nightmare in the Church of Scientology’s history’ because of the drama that could unfold if secrets are publicly revealed in court.

Scientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952. Their website reads: ‘The ultimate goal of Scientology is true spiritual enlightenment and freedom for all.’
