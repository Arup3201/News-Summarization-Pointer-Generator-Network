Airplane accident survivor Lauren Scruggs, 26, and E! News host Jason Kennedy, 33, are officially married after tying the knot Friday evening at the Four Seasons in Dallas.

The bride, wearing a gown by New York-based designer Romona Keveža, was walked down the aisle by her father Jeff, almost three years to the day after a plane propeller accident that took her left eye and part of her left arm.

She later changed into a dress by her friend, Nardos Imam, for the reception.

'Jason has completely changed my life, and I could not be more thankful for who he is and how he loves me,' Lauren told E! News

Getting ready: Here is a look at the invitations the couple sent out for their big day

Ms Scruggs and Mr Kennedy got engaged in June of this year. 

She called the night he proposed 'the happiest night' of her life.

Mr Kennedy popped the question in Dallas, in front of her family and friends, by laying out lit candles on a lawn that spelled out 'Will you marry me?' below her apartment balcony.

The couple had been dating about a year before they got engaged.

The pair first met in December 2012 after  Rancic interviewed Ms Scruggs for E! News following her recovery from her accident.

'[Rancic] was like, 'I think you should meet Jason Kennedy,'' revealed Miss Scruggs.

'I didn't know who he was. But she told me that he had this amazing Bible study in Los Angeles and had great friends.

'She texted Jason and asked if he was going to be on set. When I was asking Giuliana about places to go hiking, she told me, 'Just ask Jason places to go. He hikes all the time.'' 

They went hiking with Miss Scruggs' mom and a friend of Mr Kennedy's the next day, and the pair became instant friends.  

Miss Scruggs' amazing recovery from the tragic plane accident has been a huge inspiration to thousands of people.

'It's kind of weird to say, but I wouldn't trade it,' she told People in November 2012. 'I have seen it as a miracle. I've been through a lot but I'm living.

'Sometimes it's easy to dwell on the fact that I don't look the same. But every day I'm feeling better and better.'
