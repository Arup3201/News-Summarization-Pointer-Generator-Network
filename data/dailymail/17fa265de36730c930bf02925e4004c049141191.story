A doctor who fell in love with the husband of a patient who had died and risked her career to be with him was found to have abused her position as a GP today.

Dr Judith Ames, 52, began a relationship with Robert Owens, 66, days after Joyce Owens succumbed to lung cancer and they became engaged a fortnight later.

The doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and governing body but was prepared to quit her job to be with Mr Owens.

Every day the couple, who are due to be married in a few weeks, held hands as they arrived at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.

The tribunal panel today found Dr Ames’ actions were sexually motivated and amounted to an improper use of her position as a doctor.

During the hearing Mr Owens is referred to as ‘Mr X’ and his late wife as ‘Patient A’.

Dr Ames wiped away a tear as the findings were read out, but defiantly left the hearing room hand-in-hand with her husband-to-be.

‘The panel inferred that sexual motivation was an element of embarking on and developing what you described in your oral evidence as an “emotional” and “romantic” relationship. The panel determined that although this may not have been the primary motivation it was a factor,’ said tribunal chairman Gareth Davies.

‘The panel has determined that proceeding with an emotional relationship with Mr X while he was still a patient of your practice was an improper use of your position as a GP,’ he added.

‘The panel are of the view that had it not been for your professional relationship with Patient A, you would not have met Mr X in these circumstances.’

The hearing was told that Mr Owens was 'in the driving seat' of the relationship but the panel ruled that he was vulnerable following the recent death of his wife.

Mr Davies added: ‘His intent to proceed so rapidly and so soon after his bereavement should have alerted you to Mr X’s vulnerability.

‘In drawing your conclusion that Mr X was not vulnerable, the panel took the view that you placed too much weight on Mr X’s self-assessment and allowed no time for reflection or further observation before entering into an emotional relationship.’

The panel will now decide if her actions amounted to misconduct and if her fitness to work as a doctor is impaired.

If so she could face sanctions by her governing body which could include a ban from the profession.

Dr Ames, a divorced mother-of-three, was working at the Mannamead surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens attended the practice complaining of dizziness.

She was later diagnosed with cancer and Dr Ames became a frequent visitor to the family home.

Dr Ames said she could not help becoming emotionally involved with Mrs Owens and her family.

‘I found it very rewarding because there was a patient who I could make a difference to her suffering,’ she said.

She added: ‘I found Robert very impressive as a carer, as a very logical man who wanted to care for his wife to the best of his abilities.'

When Mrs Owens passed away on Thursday, March 8, 2012, Dr Ames visited their home and said there was ‘a sense of relief’ among the family because of their ‘strong Christian faith’.

Although it was not her practice to attend patients’ funerals, Mr Owens sent her a text on the day to remind her while she was on holiday in India.

When Dr Ames returned to the UK on March 22 she arranged to pay a ‘bereavement visit’ to Mr Owens, who had already returned to work, at the marital home.

After talking about the death of Joyce for around half an hour the conversation turned to Dr Ames’ holiday.

‘We talked about everything we wanted to talk about. He then said "I would like to thank you very much for that it was very helpful. I have no further need for help or counselling",’ said Dr Ames.

‘I think he recognised the professional boundaries and said "now can we leave that? Can we finish that professional relationship? And now I would like to hear about your holiday".’

Mr Owens met Dr Ames the following day, a Sunday, so the GP could keep her promise to Mrs Owens to attend church with her husband after her death.

Dr Ames called the General Medical Council herself to discuss the implications of her relationship

‘I realised I was developing strong feelings for him and a very strong connection of spirit and mutual intuition,’ she said.

‘I was very concerned about my professional position, which is very important to me,’ said Dr Ames.

By Tuesday Mr Owens had proposed, and the couple were making practical plans to pursue the relationship.

Mr Owens explained how the whirlwind romance with the medic had blossomed after they discovered a shared ‘free spirit.’

‘I have found in Judith my fiancee,’ he said. ‘I recognise on the day we met, March 24, I was attracted to the qualities of compassion and care she had shown my wife and given the best treatment possible to her.'

Mr Owens explained how his Christian faith allowed him to ‘live for the moment’ enabling him to cope with the death of his wife.

He added: ‘I have this mental attitude that I live for the present. I live with a very strong faith and relationship with God and I’m able to deal with things very quickly when they happen. I cared for my wife in her dying days.

‘Once she is dead, in my understanding, that’s it. I move on.’

Dr Ames and her new partner both moved quickly to deal with practical aspects of the relationship.

Mr Owens applied to be transferred to another practice and on March 30 Dr Ames spoke to a colleague, Dr Peter Leman, about the relationship.

She told him she was willing to face the consequences and would accept a period of suspension from her professional regulator.

The GP called the General Medical Council (GMC) herself to discuss the implications of her relationship.

Dr Ames resigned her post at the Mannamead surgery at the request of her colleagues, but has since found another position at the Stoke surgery, in Plymouth.

The hearing continues.
