Six months pregnant Chelsea Clinton reportedly celebrated her impending due date with a lavish -albeit healthy - baby shower in Westchester last week.

Hillary Clinton hosted the event at Crabtree's Kittle House, an upscale restaurant near the Clintons' estate in Chappaqua, New York, on July 13, according to the New York Daily News.

Due to the 34-year-old expectant mom's wheat intolerance, the menu was said to be 99per cent gluten free - as was the cake at her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.

One witness told the Daily News that former President Bill Clinton made an appearance.

'He showed up when it was about to end and worked the room. He was upstairs talking to everyone too,' the source said.

Mr Mezvinsky also attended the festivities.

Proud parents: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year,' Chelsea said in April

The couple announced that they are expecting their first child during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women at New York's Lower East Side Girls Club on April 17.

She told guests at the event: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.'

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'
