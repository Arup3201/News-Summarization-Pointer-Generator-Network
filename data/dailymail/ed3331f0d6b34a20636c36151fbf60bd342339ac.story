Russian president Vladimir Putin yesterday dramatically ordered pro-Moscow militias to scrap independence referendums planned for Sunday and claimed he had pulled his troops back from Ukraine's border.

The Kremlin leader also said Ukraine's presidential elections, due on May 25, were a step 'in the right direction'.

There were immediate suspicions last night that his words amounted to a ploy to temporarily ease Western concerns, offering an olive branch with no substantial change of position.

'Beware of this sudden move, we have 
seen these tactics before,' said one Western diplomat. 'Putin has given 
ground before, only to take it back again. This will be a hollow promise
 to his guest.'

Putin added 
that the vote would do nothing to ease the crisis engulfing the eastern 
European country unless the rights of 'all citizens' – including Russian
 speakers – were protected.

Ukraine
 has repeatedly rejected separatists' demands for greater autonomy in 
the south and east amid fears it could lead to the break-up of the 
nation of 45million.

Shortly
 before Putin's about-turn Foreign Secretary William Hague, on a visit 
to Kiev, launched a blistering attack on his stance during the conflict.

But in a blow to hopes of a
 breakthrough, Nato and the Pentagon said there was 'no indication' the 
Red Army had eased tensions by withdrawing the 40,000 troops it had 
stationed at the frontier.

Some
 militant leaders vowed to ignore Moscow's call for referendums in the 
industrial regions of Donetsk and Lugansk – branded illegal by Kiev, the
 US and EU – to be postponed.

Russia’s contestants for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest were booed in Copenhagen as it was announced they had qualified for the final of the annual competition.

Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy had originally received a warm reception when they performed their song Shine during last night’s semi-final.

However, when the 17-year-old Tolmachevy twins were voted into the final – which is to be held on Saturday - boos from the 10,000-strong audience erupted.

In contrast, the audience clapped and cheered when Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk qualified for Saturday's final too.

The annual competition is supposed to be completely removed from politics.

However, the Ukraine crisis has raised anew questions about the competition's scoring, which is partly done by phone voting across Europe.

Even though Russia has annexed Crimea, votes from the Black Sea peninsula will count for Ukraine because the phone operator there is still Ukrainian, the EBU said.

Bookmakers place Ukraine in the top 10 and Russia at the bottom.

The winner is picked by juries and television viewers across Europe.

The
 crisis in Ukraine, which has seen Russia seize Crimea from its former 
Soviet partner, is the worst between the East and West since the Cold 
War.

Putin made his remarks 
after talks in Moscow with Didier Burkhalter, head of the Organisation 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, who promised a 'road map' to 
defuse  the stand-off.

In 
what appeared to be a softening of his stance, Putin urged separatists 
to postpone the May 11 polls because he wanted to 'create the conditions
 for dialogue' after weeks in which the West accused him of fuelling 
unrest.

He said he had 
pulled back Russian forces from the Ukraine border after 'we were told 
constantly about concerns' over their positioning.

Earlier,
 Mr Hague warned the Kremlin was seeking to derail the impending 
presidential elections, brought about following the ousting of Ukraine's
 pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in February by pro-Western 
protesters.

He said: 'There 
should be no doubt the Russian government is trying to orchestrate 
conflict and provocations in the east and south of Ukraine.

'The immediate goal is the disruption of elections, although they might also be trying to provide a pretext for intervention.'

Urging
 caution over Putin's latest remarks, a Western diplomat cited Geneva 
talks last month involving the US and EU when Russia signed up to a 
peace process to lower tension. The West claims Russia failed to 
implement the deal.

Putin 
could be seeking to confuse or divide the West into delaying sanctions, 
or seeking a window to allow pro-Moscow separatists to flee from 
Sloviansk where they are besieged.

Western
 sources see Putin's main priority as disrupting Ukraine's presidential 
elections and making the country ungovernable – but achieving this by 
proxy rather that full-scale invasion.

On
 Friday the pro-Russian region of Transnistria, officially part of 
Moldova, will present a petition to Putin amounting to a massive demand 
to be incorporated into Russia, as happened with Crimea.

This
 is likely to inspire the east of Ukraine to redouble its demands for 
Russian annexation, though another theory last night was that Putin 
realised the referendums would not produce the same overwhelming 
majority for joining Russia as in Crimea.
