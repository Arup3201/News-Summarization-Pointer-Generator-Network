Famously happy to share her opinions on parenting with anyone within earshot, former Apprentice loudmouth Katie Hopkins has once again launched an attack on mothers - this time targeting the ones who chose to stay at home with their children over going to work.

Airing her views on Twitter yesterday, the self-styled 'social commentator' claimed being a full-time mother was 'merely a biological status', and certainly not a 'job'.

The controversial mouthpiece had already hit out at various 'types' of mother in her Yahoo! blog earlier this week.

The mother-of-three branded parents who home-school their children as 'certifiable', before venting her spleen on women she labels 'fat mum', advising readers to 'stare opened mouthed at her sheer size wearing only Lycra and a sneer'.

But, clearly unfulfilled by her first rant, the 38-year-old decided upon a follow-up, taking to Twitter to mock mothers who chose not to work in favour of bringing up their children at home.

She began her tirade with a statement mocking women who blame gender discrimination in the workplace as reasons for not working, saying: 'Misogyny is just a more concise way of saying business is too tough for me.'

She followed this an hour later with the tweet: 'Full-time mummy is not an occupation. It is merely a biological status.'

This is not Hopkins' first attack on mothers or on parenting in general, previously causing public outrage with such statements as 'behind every fat child is a fat mum who should take responsibility!', 'school mums are b****** because their lives are boring', 'working mothers who aren't a size eight like me are just lazy', as well as claiming babies with ginger hair are 'harder to love'.

She famously aired her strong views on the 'correct' way to parent, during an extremely heated debate with Peaches Geldof on ITV's This Morning, in which she slammed the 'attachment parenting' method Geldof uses with her two sons.

It was widely considered that Geldof emerged from the argument victorious.

Hopkins gained some support from her Twitter followers for her opinion on stay-at-home mothers, but will likely anger thousands

Her latest statements have garnered a mixed response from her 114,253 twitter followers, who oscillated between berating her for being on Twitter so much, and strong agreement with her statement.

Hopkins' most recent tirade was against the housemates of Celebrity Big Brother, upon whom she opened in an unprompted barrage of insults, saying that Linda Nolan was a 'boring old woman' who 'probably smells a little bit of wee', while suggesting former Apprentice star Luisa Zissman would be 'perfectâ€™' in a porn film.
