The glaciers that accompanied ice ages are responsible for carving out enormous swathes of rock on Earth, but these periods of cold weather may have built up its crust too

Colder spells caused water to be drawn up into glaciers, and in turn this caused sea levels to drop, allowing more magma to seep out from underwater eruptions.

This, scientists believe, caused thicker sections of crust to emerge during the same period.

UK researchers say lower sea levels caused by glaciers (stock image shown) made the crust thicken. During ice ages, sea levels could be up to 330ft (100 metres) lower. This is because water is drawn up into the glaciers and ice sheets. In turn, this reduced pressure on the ocean floor, allowing more magma to seep out

The theory - published in the journal Science - suggests that during an ice age, increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers, causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft (100 metres).

This reduces the pressure on the ocean floor, allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily.

At the surface, Antarctica is a motionless and frozen landscape.

Yet hundreds of miles down the Earth is moving at a rapid rate, research in May last year showed.

The study, led by Newcastle University and published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, explains for the first time why the upward motion of the Earth's crust in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula is currently taking place so quickly.

GPS data collected by the international research team, including experts from Newcastle University, Durham University, and the University of Colorado  revealed that the land in this region is rising at a phenomenal rate of 0.6 inches (15 mm) a year.

The effect is due to the glaciers thinning, allowing the land underneath to 'spring' upwards relatively quickly. 

Evidence for magma erupting is known from seafloor spreading centres, reports Science Magazine.

This is where plates of ocean crust move apart, allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water.

On the bottom of the oceans, this forms so-called 'abyssal hills', which are ridges hundreds of metres long, separated by valleys, on plates moving away from each other.

It suggests that climatic effects on the surface of Earth can have previously unknown effects on other parts of the planet.

Such is the effect that the oceanic crust can thicken by about 2,625ft (800 metres) during an ice age, about 10 per cent of its total thickness.

'We know that volcanism has an effect on climate,' said Dr Richard Katz, a geophysicist at the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the authors of the study, in Nature

'What we're seeing is that climate cycles are also affecting ocean volcanism.'

They also found that, during warmer times such as today, the production of new crust was stunted.

The researchers noticed the effect in chains of 'hillocks - knolls or small hills - in the seas between Australia and the Antarctic.

They examined two areas of a mid-oceanic ridge between the two regions, surveyed in 2011 and 2013, by the Korean icebreaker Araon.

Here, a chain of hills about 655ft (200 metres) high lines the sea floor.

These have been formed by a mixture of seismic activity, sedimentation, volcanoes and sea-floor spreading.

But a pattern of crustal thickness variations was found to synchronise with 23,000, 41,000 and 100,000 year glacial cycles - known as Milankovitch cycles.

Using a computer model to test their idea, the researchers found the decreased pressure on the mantle would increase the rate of mantle melting.

More magma would be spilled onto the sea floor, explaining the formation of thick abyssal hills underwater.

'Step back and think about this: Small variations in the orbital parameters of the Earth - tilt and eccentricity and wobble - are recorded on the sea floor,' said Dr Katz to Science Magazine, referring to ice ages.

'It kind of blows my mind.'

Furthermore, the research may also explain another puzzle about ice ages - why they start gradually but end suddenly.

It's possible that increased seafloor eruptions by the decrease in pressure releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

This would warm the atmosphere and ultimately cause the ice sheets to melt.

'It's a very seductive idea, and an interesting one,' said Dr David Lund, a paleoceanographer at the University of Connecticut, Avery Point, in Science Magazine.

'The ice sheet gets so big that it seeds its own destruction.'

This allowed more 'crust' to form underwater - known as abyssal hills

Interestingly, this ultimately caused the ice age to 'self destruct', as the increased magma would release more CO2 - and warm the atmosphere
