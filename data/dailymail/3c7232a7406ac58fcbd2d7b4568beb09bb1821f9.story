A 13-year-old girl suspected of stabbing a classmate to please the internet meme Slender Man told police she was 'excited' to kill her friend - because she thought it would help prove the horror character exists.

Anissa Weier and friend Morgan Geyser, who were 12 at the time of the alleged incident, also told police different accounts of the horrific act when they were interviewed in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha, Wisconsin. 

The pair are accused of knifing Peyten Lautner 19 times before leaving her for dead in the woods on May 31, 2014. She managed to save herself by crawling to get help from a passing bicyclist.

A video of the suspects' chilling interrogation was released by police last week.  

During questioning, the girls told officers they tried to kill the girl to appease the mythical character. 

One of them however said: 'I was excited because I wanted proof that he existed because there were a bunch of skeptics out there saying he didn't exist.

'I was afraid of what would happen if I didn't ... I didn't want to find out what would happen if we didn't.'    

According to NBC, one of the girls said the other told her they could become Slender Man's 'proxies' if they killed the victim 

In the video of the interview, obtained by WISN, the girls both say they told Peyton they wanted to go bird watching, this after planning their attack on the school bus.

'People who trust you become very gullible,' Morgan told police.  'And it was sort of sad.'

Anissa is more emotional during her interview, wiping away tears at one point.

Anissa said at one point Slender Man would kill their families if they did not kill Peyton

'We told her we were going to get help,' she told police about the moments after the two stabbed Peyton. '

'But we weren't. We were going to run and let her pass away. So we ran.'

The girls were running off to find Slender Man, and were later picked up walking along a highway off-ramp, and Morgan had a knife in her backpack.

In the interrogation video, Morgan can also been seen with blood on her shirt, which she has photographed at one point.

She also begins singing to herself at one point during the six-hour interview, and told police of her plan; 'You have no idea how difficult it was not to tell anyone. I knew we'd get in trouble.'

When she described the actually stabbing, she said; 'It just sort of happened. It didn't feel like anything. It was like air.'

Morgan and Anissa said they stabbed their friend to appease the Slender Man

As for Slender Man, Morgan described him as a man with 'tendrils that are very sharp.'

'I see him in my dreams,' she told police,

Anissa said in her interview that she did not have the same visions as Morgan, but knew she had to kill her friend for the Slender Man.

'I decided to go along, tag along, to prove the skeptics wrong,' she said.

Then, when asked if she saw the Slender Man, she told police; 'Uh huh, after Morgan stabbed [Peyton].'

She also revealed that Morgan said to her; 'I kinda sorta made a deal with Slender saying that if I didn't, if we didn't kill Peyton that he would, would either or could kill our families and everything we love.' 

The two girls are charged in adult court with attempted first-degree intentional homicide. If convicted, each could be sentenced to up to 65 years in the state prison system. Their attorneys want their cases moved to children's court where a conviction could send them to a secure facility until age 25.

Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren said he intends to issue a ruling in the case March 13.
