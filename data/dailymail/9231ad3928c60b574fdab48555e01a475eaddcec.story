Arsenal's Wellington Silva, a 21-year-old Brazilian who joined them almost five years ago but is yet to play a game because of work permit issues, is among players facing bans from football if allegations of match-fixing in Spain are proved in court.

Silva, a winger, joined from Fluminese for around £3.5m in January 2010, and played in the reserves that summer but did not get a ‘special talent visa’ as anticipated.

He has been out on loan at a succession of Spanish clubs ever since and is currently at Almeria. He was on loan at Levante in May 2011 when he played for them in a 2-1 end-of-season defeat to Real Zaragoza - a match now at the centre of major match-fix case.

A criminal complaint was filed by Spanish prosecutors last week, naming 41 people who may now face court hearings, probably in February. Manchester United’s Ander Herrera, who played for Zaragoza in the match, and Swansea’s Jefferson Montero, who was playing alongside Silva for Levante that day, are also among the 41 names and could face trial. Silva is among those already interviewed by prosecutors. All the players deny any wrongdoing.

By winning the match, Zaragoza avoided relegation. It is alleged in court papers filed last week that the club’s financial director Francisco Javier Porquera paid €965,000 (£757,000) to 11 squad members at his club, including Herrera, and that the players withdrew money from their bank accounts in cash and gave it back to him. It is alleged that money in turn ended up with the Levante players.

Court documents show Herrera received two payments, of €50,000 (£39,000) and €40,000 (£31,000), from the €965,000. Some Zaragoza players have admitted getting the money but dispute its purpose. Herrera said in a statement last week: ‘I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results … I love football and I believe in fair play, both on and off the pitch.’

Theoretical punishments for anyone found guilty of fixing range from prison sentences of up to four years, to large fines and bans from playing. Experts in Spanish law believe even ‘guilty’ verdicts would not end in custodial sentences for anyone without any previous criminal convictions. But lengthy bans would be a real possibility.

Wellington Silva will become eligible for a British work permit next summer and is expected to return to Arsenal for the 2015-16 season. Only the case clouds his future. An Arsenal spokesman told MailSport: ‘We have no further information on this and no comment to make.’
