Eugenie Bouchard declared herself to be relaxed about the 'Twirlygate' controversy at the Australian Open, after she was asked to do a twirl by the on court interviewer following her second round.

Last year's Wimbledon finalist laughed off the subsequent furore after defeating France's Caroline Garcia to make the last sixteen with a 7-6 6-0 victory.

On court interviewer Ian Cohen has been accused of being 'truly sexist' by tennis great Billie Jean King and been taken to task by others. But the 20 year-old Canadian, while having a few reservations, chose to take a less serious approach to the issue.

She did, however, say that the men should be asked to do similar little stunts to make it a level playing field and tweeted a cartoon poking fun at the incident.

'I think it was just kind of funny,' she said. 'You know, I'm fine with being asked to twirl if they ask the guys to flex their muscles and stuff. My friends are texting me saying I dance and twirl well.

'Personally I'm not offended. I think it was an in-the-moment thing and it was funny. But it's just funny how it's taken a life of its own. I'm just going to try to focus on my tennis.' 

An Australian Open rarely goes by without some kind of incident arising from the broadcasters' insistence here that immediately after the match the interviewers try and raise a laugh for the crowd.

Bouchard is familiar with the pitfalls of these interviews. Last year she was asked who her dream date would be , and she responded ‘Justin Bieber’, for which the crowd roundly booed her.

'They try to ask funny questions. It's entertaining, I guess,' said Bouchard. ' I don't mind it. People can think what they want about it, but I just answer how I want and do what I want. I'm fine with it.'

She did, though, express the wish that people would not overlook serious athletic talent and her achievement of making another Grand Slam fourth round. This is a big year for her after her breakthrough in 2014 and so far she has responded admirably.

Garcia has plenty of ability and led in the first set. 'I'm happy that I've played three solid matches here,' said Bouchard. ' and we could definitely be a little bit more focused on that.'
