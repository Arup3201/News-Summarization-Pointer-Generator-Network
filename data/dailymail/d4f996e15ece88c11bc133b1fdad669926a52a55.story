He was in the throes of a political scandal that would ultimately see him forced to leave the White House.

And this recording of a phone call between Richard Nixon and his Chief of Staff H.R Haldeman in April 1973 suggests the embattled president may have indulged in a few drinks to take his mind off the Watergate trial.

In it the president - who hours before had announced that Haldeman would be resigning over Watergate - can be heard telling his long-serving aide: 'You're a strong man, Goddamnit, and I love you.'

'I love you, as you know... like my brother': Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, left, sounds emotional during the phone conversation with H.R. Haldeman, right, whose resignation he had demanded after Watergate

After vowing to never 'discuss the son-of-bitching Watergate thing again', 'never, never, never, never', Nixon goes on to declare again: 'I love you, as you know... like my brother.'

He goes on to ask whether Haldeman could make some calls to gauge the reaction to his speech that day, 'like the old style'.

Haldeman tells his now ex-boss: 'I don't think I can... I'm in an odd spot to try and do that.'

Nixon quickly adds: 'I completely agree... Don't call a Goddamn soul.'

Saying goodbye, the president tells Haldeman, who he had known for almost 20 years: 'Alright boy, keep the faith.'

Scandal: The former White House Chief of Staff ultimately served 18 months in prison over Watergate

AUDIO: Listen to call between Richard Nixon and White House Chief of Staff in April 1973

Long-time adviser: Richard Nixon, then Vice President, is seen with Haldeman in March 1960

Featured in the CNN documentary 'Our Nixon', the audio clip of the former U.S. president's bizarre ramblings have led to speculation that he was drunk at the time of the phone call, which took place at 10.16pm on April 30.

'Keep the faith': Richard Nixon announced his own resignation on August 8 1974

That day Nixon had delivered a speech announcing the resignations of his closest advisers, Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, the assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs, in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

He also used the televised speech to confirm that White House counsel John Dean and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst would also be resigning.

During their conversation Nixon appears to bemoan the fact that no other cabinet officers aside from Haldeman had called him after his speech.

Haldeman tries to reassure Nixon that staff had tried to prevent his own call from being put through to the President.

'When I called, the board said they had been instructed not to put any calls through,' Haldeman says.

Nixon, apparently unconvinced, replies: 'The hell with that, I told them to put all the calls through.'

Haldeman eventually served 18 months in prison after being convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in January 1975.

The Watergate scandal was triggered by a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington on June 17, 1972, when five men were arrested for trying to bug the building.

By October of that year, the FBI had linked the break-in to spying and sabotage by the Republican President's re-election campaign.

On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. President to resign, after handing over 64 tapes of White House discussions.

It would be a further 29 years before 'Deep Throat', the secret informant who provided information on the story to Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, was identified as former FBI associate director Mark Felt.

President Nixon: Hello?

H.R Haldeman: Hi.

Nixon: Hope I didn't let you down.

Haldeman: No, sir. You got your points over, and now you've got it set right and move on. You're right where you ought to be.

Nixon: Well, it's a tough thing, Bob, for you and for John and the rest, but, goddamnit, I'm never going to discuss the son-of-bitching Watergate thing again. Never, never, never, never. Don't you agree?

Haldeman: Yes, sir. You've done it now, and you've laid out your position. You've laid out--you've taken your steps. You've put the--

Nixon: Interesting thing, we haven't heard a - the only cabinet member that has called-and this is 50 minutes after the thing is over-- is Cap Weinberger, bless his soul. All the rest are waiting to see what the polls show. Goddamn strong Cabinet, isn't it?

Haldeman: You better check and be sure, because they may--you know , we've had a --

Nixon: No, they know, they know, they know who to call, they know they can get through. But in any event, I just want you to know that Cap called -and he is all the way.

Haldeman: Good.

Nixon: But let me say you're a strong man, goddamnit, and I love you.

Haldeman: Well-

Nixon: And, you know, I love John and all the rest, and, by God, keep the faith. Keep the faith. You're going to win this son of a bitch.

Haldeman: Absolutely.

Nixon: You noticed what I said about the violence and so forth on the other side? I mean there were some intricacies in this that only the sophisticated will understand.

Haldeman: Yes sir. I want to get the text because there were some things to work on from there, that we can build on--

Nixon: I thought it was good to end on what I deeply felt - the religious note - you know - God bless America. I'm sure it must have driven you up the wall, it didn't drive me up the wall, but I felt that way.

Haldeman: No, I'm all for that, I completely agree.

Nixon: I don't know whether you can call and get any reactions? And call me back, like the old style?

Haldeman: I don't think I can

Nixon: I completely agree

Haldeman: I'm in an odd spot to try and do that-

Nixon: Don't call a goddamn soul. Let me just say, getting this call from you, when I haven't heard from any cabinet officer, except Weinberger, an hour afterwards - and no staff member-

Haldeman: When I called, the board said they were instructed not to put any calls through-

Nixon: The hell with that, I told them to put all the calls through

Haldeman: Well, that may be why you haven't gotten them - because-

Nixon: Alright, I'll change it. Fine, I'll change it. But God bless you boy, God bless you, I love you, as you know, as my brother.

Haldeman: OK

Nixon: Alright boy, keep the faith.

Haldeman: RightÂ
