For those who didn’t blow their budget on Christmas gifts, this pimped-out 2015 Cadillac Escalade available for purchase has been taken to a new level of luxury.

The sport utility vehicle’s rear passenger compartment has been converted into an extravagant private office and cinema, complete with a 48in television mounted against the driver’s partition.

Mounted to the driver's partition, the curved 4K smart TV is the most alluring feature in the vehicle

While the curved 4K smart TV is the most alluring feature, the Escalade boasts a TracVision satellite TV system, iPad, Mac mini computer, 24-karat gold-plated hardware, tables stowed in the seats, and connections for video conferencing for high-flyers who need to work on the go.

It also has a higher ceiling with LED lighting, two leather captain’s chairs and jump seats, and window shades – and everything can be controlled with the push of a button.

For those who are concerned about security, surveillance cameras are mounted on the exterior of the vehicle and the images are displayed on monitors inside the vehicle.

Lexani Motorcars has not disclosed the price of its ultra-luxurious SUV – known as the Concept One Curve.

But a basic 2015 Cadillac Escalade retails for nearly £73,000 in the US (approximately £47,000).

The company, based in Corona, California, near Los Angeles, can also customise the vehicle with armoured protection.
