Rory, a keen footy player, was diagnosed with the rare tumour just days before he was due to fly out to Disneyland with his family

A Sydney family has described the incredibly cruel impact cancer has had on their life following the double diagnosis of a father and son just eight months apart.

In a heart-wrenching interview aired on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes program, the Williams family revealed the devastating moment cancer took hold of the youngest boy, 11-year-old Rory, before illness also struck his 44-year-old father Grant just eight months after.

The avalanche of bad news began to tumble downhill after Rory's diagnosis in November, just days before the family were due to fly out on a dream holiday to Disneyland. Rory's parents took the keen footy player to hospital when they noticed his stomach began to swell significantly.

'My mum thought that something was wrong but Dad's like 'youâ€™re probably eating too much Maccas,' Rory said.

It turned out his diet had nothing to do with his stomach's ballooning growth, but everything to do with the football-sized tumour hiding inside.

'I think our life prior to this was a very average suburban day-to-day life .. very solid and happy,' mother Leanne said.

First Rory, then Grant Williams was told he too had a cancer in a cruel blow to the family which were still dealing with the news of the 11-year-old's diagnosis

His father had joked he'd been eating too much fast food - but doctors discovered a football-sized tumour (right) when Rory was taken to hospital

'Now I feel like we have the same life but instead of living on solid ground we are on the edge of a precipice.'

It meant Rory's long-awaited trip of a lifetime to visit Disneyland was put on hold indefinitely. The news - enough to reduce his parents to tears.

'You talk about going from the penthouse to the basement,' Mr Williams said.

'For an 11-year-old kid to think he is about to get on a plane to Disneyland and then get told he's got cancer the next day, is just mind boggling.'

Rory's mother and father both broke down during the heartfelt interview with Ben Fordham who is a close friend of the pair and the godfather of the 11-year-old

Despite the intensity of the situation, Rory Williams remained incredibly upbeat during the interview. At times, the 11-year-old was joking with interviewer Ben Fordham saying the reason behind his ballooning stomach was his poor diet

The mind-boggling news was made worse after hearing that doctors were unable to operate on the tumour. Too big, the family knew despite hoping otherwise, that Rory's cancer was serious.

'All I remember him saying to me is, 'am I going to die?' Mr Williams said.

'That took all I had to say 'mate of course you're not going to die' and not cry myself.'

Knowing chemotherapy, radiation and surgery wouldn't work, there was only one hope of bringing the watermelon-sized growth to it's knees and that was a shot of a therapy drug called Crizotinib.

The untested drug which had only been trialed in a small sample of pediatric cases and adults with lung cancer, had amazing results.

Rory had four CT scans, the last of which showed remarkable trials that a drug had removed a large portion of the cancer in his stomach

Months on and four CT scans later the doctors at Randwick Children's Hospital revealed the remarkable change in Rory's condition.

Oncologist Dr Toby Trahair said the the tumour's reduction in size was 'almost a miracle.'

'But it is also important to be optimistic on the one hand and realistic on the other.'

Meanwhile as Rory's condition started to improve, his father received the gut wrenching news that a cancer had begun to grown inside his own body just eight months after Rory's diagnosis.

'I found out last Thursday. I've got prostate cancer,' Mr Williams said.

'The way I look at it is, Rory's got a tumor that is sort of a one in a million tumor. 'When the prostate cancer was diagnosed it was kind of like we've already had the shark attack this is just a mozzy bite.'

When the family found out about Rory's condition, Grant Williams sent a text message to family and friends telling them of Rory's diagnosis. He told 60 minutes he couldn't believe what he was writing in the message was true.

But months of target treatment using the the trial of a cancer therapy drug reduced it to the size of a golf ball. 'It is almost a miracle. 'It's almost a miracle' Oncologist Dr Toby Trahair said.

Nonetheless, Mr Williams admitted it was still incredibly tough news to take.

'How do the two boys in the family get cancer at the same time?, he said. 'It's just ridiculous.'

Knowing his family weren't the only ones with a young child battling cancer, Mr Williams said they also won't be the last. 'You can't sit back and think don't worry about it it's not our caper ... that won't happen.

'Well, it's happened to us.'

He said he wanted people to pledge their support to the annual Gold Telethon fundraising event for Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick. It raises funds to buy life-saving equipment, fund research and deliver vital services to help young patients.

'That's probably the only reason we told this story. These kids are just plain unlucky, they've done absolutely nothing ... there's nothing but bad luck involved and we need to save these kids it's as simple as that.'
