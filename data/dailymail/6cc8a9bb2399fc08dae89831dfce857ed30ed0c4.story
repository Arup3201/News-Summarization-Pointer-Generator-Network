The Lawrence killers will be sentenced as juveniles and could serve as little as 12 years for Britain’s most notorious race murder.

This is because Gary Dobson and David Norris, now in their mid-30s with receding hairlines, were teenagers when they were part of the mob that stabbed Stephen Lawrence to death in April 1993.

The Criminal Justice Act 1991 sets out the range of sentencing options open to trial judge Mr Justice Treacy when he recommends the length of their jail terms today.

Technically they will be ‘detained at Her Majesty’s Pleasure’ – the equivalent of a life sentence.

They will then be considered for release on parole after serving the minimum term. The starting point for a murder conviction is 12 years.

However, the court can take into account the fact that Stephen’s murder was racially aggravated.

Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that in a case of this age the law requires a court ‘to sentence to effectively what would have been the punishment shortly after the crime had been committed’.

He said: ‘In the context of this case particularly, the age of the defendants being 16 and 17, the punishment the court would impose would be very much directed at those ages.’

Once sentenced both Dobson and Norris will need special protection from prison revenge attacks because of the notoriety of their crime.

Insiders believe they could be given ‘vulnerable’ prisoner status and placed with sex offenders in a segregated wing of prison to ensure they are not ambushed by inmates furious about their role in Stephen’s death.

The Mail can reveal that Norris was attacked by three black inmates while on remand in Belmarsh prison, South London, just weeks after he was arrested for Stephen’s murder in September 2010.

Prison sources said the three men, thought to be Muslims, beat him after Norris tried to ‘throw his weight around’ by using his family underworld reputation.

The attack left him with problems to his hearing and throughout the trial he had to wear a special headset to follow the proceedings.

It also saw extra protection placed on him at the prison and heightened fears that he and Dobson will be ‘marked men’.

Following their convictions yesterday, the pair were taken to Belmarsh. In due course, they are likely to be transferred to Category A prisons elsewhere in the country.

Prison bosses will be mindful they have a ‘duty of care’. Soham murderer Ian Huntley, who was slashed in the throat in 2010 in jail, attempted to sue authorities for failing to protect him.
