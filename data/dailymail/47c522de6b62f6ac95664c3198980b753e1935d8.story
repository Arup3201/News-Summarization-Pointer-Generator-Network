Ryan Dickinson was imprisoned for 17 
months for part in June carnage

Hundreds of Vancouver Canucks fans took part in violence after losing Stanley Cup to Boston Bruins

An ice hockey fan who went on the rampage in Vancouver after his team lost the Stanley Cup has been the first to be jailed for his part in a mass riot.

Ryan Dickinson was imprisoned for 17 months after using a newspaper box to repeatedly smash a police car and the leg of a barricade to destroy another in June last year.

Vancouver city centre was packed with thousands of fans hoping to celebrate the Canucks first win of ice hockey's biggest prize, but the party descended into mass violence after the Boston Bruins thrashed them in the deciding match, which they lost 4-0.

Cars were set alight, turned over and stolen as police warned that a chemical agent would be sprayed in the streets if people did not disperse.

Dozens of shop windows were smashed and looted by fans shouting:'I hate you, Boston!'  

Sentencing Dickinson yesterday Judge Malcolm MacLean described him as a ringleader in the civil disorder that swept through the city.

'His persistent and deliberate actions were not consistent with someone who merely got caught up in the moment,' he said.

Dickinson, of Coquitlam, British Columbia, pleaded guilty to taking part in the riot after the seventh game of the Stanley Cup finals.

To date, a total of 350 charges have been recommended against 125 accused.

The ugly scenes brought back memories of a riot that erupted when Vancouver also lost the Stanley Cup in 1994.  

Dickinson had breached a curfew on the night of June 15 last year, set because of a previous assault charge the judge said was 'unsettling, as it involved serious personal violence.'

'Mr Dickinson’s participation was serious and involved a number of conscious and deliberate decisions on his part, starting with his decision to go downtown knowing that would result in a breach of his bail,' he added.

A pre-sentence report said he lived in an 'unstable and dysfunctional family environment' and 'without discipline.'

Dickinson’s probation officer added he has a 'disregard for his parents’ authority, the educational system and the justice system,' started drinking alcohol at 12 and had lost jobs because of his addiction.

Police said today that his imprisonment was a 'victory for the victims and citizens of Vancouver'
