MPs will have the chance to deny prisoners the vote once and for all, following a bitter seven-year dispute with the European Court of Human Rights.

A free vote is set to be held on maintaining the blanket ban, as demanded by David Cameron who said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel sick.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insists parliament has the right to reject the controversial European ruling, although Britain could be slapped with a fine, and a compensation bill from prisoners suing the Government which could run to £100million.

Mr Grayling will lay out three options for consultation in a draft bill on Thursday - retaining the current ban, or allowing votes for certain prisoners serving up to six months or up to four years.

Friday is the deadline to comply with the 2005 ECHR ruling that denying prisoners the vote breaches their human rights. The Court says individual countries can decide which prisoners should be denied votes, but not impose a total ban.

A vote on the law would not be held before next year but Britain is highly unlikely to comply with the Court as a non-binding vote last February saw an overwhelming vote of 234 MPs to 22 back maintaining the ban.

Obligation: Attorney General Dominic Grieve says that legally Britain must comply with the directive

Labour yesterday voiced its support for the status quo, saying the Court should respect Britain’s ‘sensible and proportionate’ stance. Few Liberal Democrats are expected to rebel.

While concerns have been raised by Attorney General Dominic Grieve that Britain is under an international legal obligation to comply, the Prime Minister is determined to stand firm.

He told MPs last month he was happy to introduce legislation to ‘help put the legal position beyond doubt’ and said ‘no-one should be in any doubt: prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.’

Tory MP Peter Bone welcomed what he said was ‘the Government for the first time... saying Parliament’s decisions will overrule the European Court’.

He added: ‘The British people want Parliament to be supreme, ignore this Mickey Mouse European Court.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said a vote on legislation would strengthen the UK’s argument on retaining the ban, and that passing a binding law - rather than a motion as in the past - could force the European Court to look at the issue again.

However critics fear Britain’s hands could be tied. Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said ignoring the Court’s ruling would leave ministers unable to criticise countries which flout the rules and summarily lock up their citizens.

He said: ‘If you say total defiance of the European Court of Human Rights, your influence criticising any other country that breach the European Court of Human Rights is zero.’

Warning: Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn and Tory MP Dominic Raab have warned about going against European law

The Government is being sued by 500 inmates for being denied the vote.

Yesterday their lawyer Sean Humber of law firm Leigh Day and Co said the claims were already ‘running into the millions’ and that the vote was ‘unlikely to satisfy the court or stave off costly legal action.’

Under the Strasbourg ruling, the government has until Thursday to come forward with proposals for ending Britain’s ‘general, automatic and indiscriminate disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners.’

Dominic Raab, the Tory MP and a former lawyer at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said: ‘We are heading for a constitutional clash, putting Strasbourg’s political agenda on a collision course with Britain’s democratic prerogatives.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the Government was ‘considering how best to proceed following the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights’ and that an announcement would be made to Parliament shortly.’
