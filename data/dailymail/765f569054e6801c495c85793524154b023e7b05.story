The ancient mound of Silbury Hill was built as lighthouse and harbour to help Neolithic traders navigate  waterways, an expert has claimed.

Archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in Wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in  rituals.

But a cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a  stone avenue between the mound and the nearby  stone circle of Avebury.

Land ahoy! The expert a claims southern Britain was a series of islands linked by waterways, channels and swollen rivers, and that Stonehenge was effectively located on the coast. The mound (pictured) would have acted as a lighthouse and harbour for those travelling by boat

Robert John Langdon said this suggests the hill was a lighthouse for travellers who docked at the mound and walked to the circle for goods.

He said: 'The maps I have produced indicate that Avebury was a trading place for our ancestors.

'My assumption is that the nearby monument of Silbury Hill would have been used as a harbour, once the waters had eventually receded from the main site of Avebury.

Mysterious: Until now archaeologists and historians have  speculated the huge man-made structure in Wiltshire (pictured) was an ornate grave or a ceremonial hilltop to get closer to the gods

Mr Langdon says southern Britain was a series of islands linked by waterways, channels and swollen rivers, and that Stonehenge was effectively located on the coast.

He believes he has discovered an avenue leading to the massive stone circle at Avebury - an older and bigger site than Stonehenge.

He said this indicates Silbury Hill was merely a beacon to guide people to Avebury and added: 'This concept and use of hills are commonplace at the time of the Roman Empire and thereafter, but it was not their invention.

'The Romans inherited the idea from other cultures such as the Egyptians, who had their "Lighthouse of Alexandria". 

'We have now found our very own 'Lighthouse of Avebury', but some 2,000 years earlier.' 

'Therefore, a direct pathway would have been used from Silbury Hill to Avebury for goods, which according to archaeologists doesn't exist.

'If you are going to spend years or even decades building such a construction, there has to be a social or financial reward for your endeavours.

'We now know through recent excavations that this mound was built in stages, starting small, then getting taller. 

'If it was purely symbolic you wouldn't need to change the size.

'You only change the height of this monument if it serves as a beacon to attract ships and boats to the trading place of Avebury, for the higher you build, the greater the visible range.'

Iconic Silbury Hill is a 98ft (30 metre) high prehistoric artificial chalk mound which is part of the Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Mr Langdon says that southern Britain was a series of islands linked by waterways, channels and swollen rivers, and that Stonehenge was effectively located on the coast.

The Neolithic period  - also known as the 'New Stone Age' - spanned from around 4000 to 2,500 BC and was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and a more sedentary style of living.

Gods: New importance was placed on religion, and ritual  (Neolithic religious monument pictured)

The preceding period of the last, post-glacial hunter-gatherer societies is known as the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age.

To make room for the new farmland, deforestation took place which permanently transformed the landscape.

This moment is sometimes referred to as the 'Neolithic revolution' but radiocarbon dating has revealed that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer was relatively gradual.

It was believed that the introduction of farming into Britain was the result of a huge migration from mainland Europe, but genetic research suggests that the influx  was probably  small - somewhere around 20 per cent of the total population.

These people also brought with them the first seed grains of wheat and barley, which had been bred from wild grasses that grew in the region of modern-day Iraq.

New types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced too. 

The Neolithic also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape, many of which were enormous.

The earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the Early Neolithic but later stone circles were built, a trend that continued into the  Bronze Age.

These constructions reflect a shift in culture - a new importance that was placed on religion, ritual and social hierarchy.

The people that lived during this period left behind no written records, however, so all that is known  comes from archaeological evidence.
