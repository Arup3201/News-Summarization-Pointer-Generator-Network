A devastated family is searching for a retired firefighter who vanished from a train somewhere between Denver and Chicago, and may need medical attention.

Charlie Dowd, 69, boarded a train from his native San Mateo, California, home on Wednesday morning to visit his son and grandchildren in Montreal, Canada.

He was supposed to transfer in Chicago but when the train got there on Friday afternoon, Mr Dowd was not on it, but his luggage, cellphone and medication was.

Missing: Charles Dowd, 69, was on his way to Montreal from California via Amtrak when he vanished somewhere between Denver and Chicago

His son talked to him on Thursday evening when the train was in the Denver area - the last time he was heard from Mr Dowd.

His daughter Jennifer Dowd told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'This is not in my dad's character at all. This is a big mystery. We're very worried about him.'

Family members said that they are worried that Dowd may become disoriented without his medication.

Jennifer Dowd told the Chronicle: 'He just got approval from his doctor to take this trip. We never, ever would have let him travel cross-country if we thought he was in any danger.'

The family told ABC affiliate KGO that Mr Dowd also takes medication for high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.

Cops are also investigating a tip that Mr Dowd became confused during the train ride, and told an Amtrak employee that he didnâ€™t believe he was on a train.

He is believed to have told a conductor on Friday morning that he thought he was in an apartment and needed to find the front door.

The investigation is focused on Omaha, Nebraska - where the train stopped at about 11pm on Thursday night.

A search party has been organised to scour the area and hand out flyers today at 3pm at the train station.

Dowd is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds.
