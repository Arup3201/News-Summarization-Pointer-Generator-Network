If you were hoping for a final burst of summer sun, then you might want to lower your expectations.

According to forecasters, the season could well have come to an early end – with low temperatures, storms and gales set to sweep across the country. A band of low pressure means colder air is on its way, and there have even been predictions of snow across some areas in the north.

Temperatures are expected to fall noticeably over the coming days throughout the country, with most parts of the UK facing a dip down to the low teens, almost five degrees below the average for this time of year.

Anyone looking to get out and about on the August bank holiday will have to wrap up warm, as winds of up to 50mph were recorded yesterday, and could continue throughout the week.

The UK’s seaside areas will also see large waves rolling in to batter the coastline.

Chief
 Met Office forecaster Eddy Carroll said yesterday: ‘While wind gusts 
would not be unusual in the autumn and winter, they are likely to pose a
 few more problems in the summer holiday period, especially for those 
engaged in activities such as sailing or walking.’

He added: ‘Some 
minor disruption to transport is possible, for example delays to 
ferries, bridge restrictions and perhaps minor damage to trees.’

Despite
 a brief let-up towards the end of the week, wet weather is predicted to
 return in the middle of the bank holiday weekend. And higher areas of 
Scotland could see snow later this week as the low pressure sends a cold
 north-westerly wind across much of the country.

Areas above 1,300 
metres, such as the Cairngorms and the Munros in the Highlands, could 
see flurries of snow arrive a whole month earlier than last year.

A 
spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘A spell of low pressure sitting 
north of Scotland is to blame for the colder temperatures and showers 
expected across the UK this week. We’re looking at average or below 
average temperatures and the nighttime low could be down to single 
figures.’

They added: ‘It’s getting cooler definitely. It’s the end of 
summer.’

And former BBC forecaster Michael Fish said: ‘It could well 
get cool enough around the middle of the week for some of those showers 
to fall as snow on the mountains. Makes you shiver doesn’t it? Winter’s 
not very far away.’

However Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts 
offered a more optimistic outlook, saying: ‘Into the bank holiday it 
looks like conditions will be returning nearer to normal for the time of
 year.’

She went on to stress: ‘We can often see sunny and warm weather to September and beyond.’

Today, music
 fans at V Festival at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex, had to wear ponchos 
and hide under umbrellas and blankets as they braved the wet weather.

Winds of up to 50mph have already been
 recorded in parts of the North West and the Scottish Highlands as the 
areas were battered by rain.

However
 temperatures of 20C (68F) were recorded around London and the South 
East.

The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for much of the North and Scotland today with gusts of up to 50mph forecast. Coastal areas have been put on alert for ‘large waves’ and meteorologists warned transport links could be hit by disruption.

The
 blustery and wet conditions are set to continue into the first part of the 
week, with yellow ‘be aware’ warnings for wind also in place for today.

The mercury is also set to fall well 
below the average for late summer and there is even the possibility of 
some frost on the ground during the week.

Calum
 Maccoll, another Met Office spokesman, said there is a ‘very autumnal’ 
and ‘unseasonably cool’ feel to the conditions in northern areas.

Despite the wind weather warnings, there are no rain warnings in place for this week.

Performers today at V Festival in Essex - an event which also happens in Weston Park, Staffordshire - include The Killers, Paolo Nutini and Lily Allen.

Meanwhile, bookmakers Ladbrokes were offering 2/1 for snow to fall somewhere before the end of the Bank Holiday weekend later this month.

The company was also offering 5/1 that a new low temperature for August is recorded, beating the 4.5C set in Lagganlia in the Highlands in 1973.
