A disabled man has set a new world record for the 100m sprint - by running on his hands in crutches.

Tameru Zegeye, 32, completed the incredible feat in a time of 56 seconds in the small town of Fürth in north Bavaria, Germany, last week.

He balanced on crutches in a handstand position - before 'running' the race with his legs dangling over his head.

Amazing: Tameru Zegeye has set a new world record for the 100m sprint - by running on his hands in crutches

Skilled: He completed the incredible feat in a time of 56 seconds in Fürth in north Bavaria, Germany, last week

Up he goes: He balanced on his hands on crutches (right) before going into a handstand (left) and 'walking'

Mr Zegeye, who was born with severely deformed feet, used the crutches he relies on to walk in daily life to complete the 100m distance.

He said he was delighted to have achieved his 'dream' of becoming a world record holder.

'One by one, I am achieving my dreams, and in my life I have personally achieved lots despite many struggles,' said Mr Zegeye, who undertakes daily training sessions to perfect his unique act.

'This
 is my dream to be an official world record holder and I want to show 
the world that even if I am disabled, I can do amazing things. 

Talented: Mr Zegeye, who was born with severely deformed feet, used the crutches he relies on to walk in daily life to complete the 100m distance. Above, the performer is pictured walking on his hands on his crutches

Casual stroll: The performer said he was delighted to have achieved his 'dream' of setting a new world record

'I am talented like my hero Usain Bolt, because he can run the 
fastest 100m with his legs and I can do the same while balanced 
upright on my crutches.

'I would love for him to see and enjoy what I have done because he is great.'

Mr Zegeye, from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, was abandoned by his mother at just three-months-old after being born with severely deformed feet.

The extremities resembled two ineffective stumps - with both turned inwards towards each other.

Crossing the finishing line: Mr Zegeye described himself as being 'talented' like his hero, Usain Bolt. Above, the sprinter (far left) crosses the finish line ahead of international competitiors at the London 2012 Olympic Games

He was taken in by his grandfather and started to teach himself how to carry himself on his arms.

'When I was born my mother said I was cursed and carried the devil,' said Mr Zegeye, who performs with a circus in Germany. 'My grandfather saved my life.

'He said every human had the right to a life and this is probably what has made me feel like I can achieve anything.'

Mr Zegeye finally underwent life-changing
 surgery paid for by a stranger whom he met in church - allowing him to 
walk on his legs with the aid of crutches for the first time.

Taking a breather: He was taken in by his grandfather and started to teach himself how to carry himself on his arms. He now performs with a circus in Germany. Above, Mr Zegeye is pictured with an unnamed onlooker

Now, he captivates audiences across Germany with his unique act that sees him flip on to his hands on crutches and 'walk'.

'This is just one world record that I can do which I have not seen anyone else do, ever,' said the performer.

'I want to show the world my skills and I will continue working hard with my training every day.'

His new world record evidence will now be sent to Guinness World Record officials to verify.
