New questions have arisen in the Deflategate scandal as it is now being reported that all 24 of the Patriots footballs were tested prior to the game under standard NFL practices, and all 24 passed inspection. 

What's more, Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, assumed by many to have put the events in motion which led to the current NFL investigation of the New England Patriots, has denied stating that a ball he intercepted from Tom Brady during Sunday's AFC Championship game felt underinflated.

Speaking to the press following a Pro Bowl practice on Thursday, Jackson said; 'I'm a linebacker, I'm a defensive guy. If anybody recognized anything it definitely wouldn't come from me.'

This as many are calling on the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell to make a statement about just what caused 11 of the team's 12 balls to have less air pressure than is required by league rules.

'I'm a linebacker, I'm a defensive guy. If anybody recognized anything it definitely wouldn't come from me,' said Jackson of intercepting Brady (above)

Meanwhile, many are wondering when the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell (above) will offer an explanation as to what happened to make 11 of the team's 12 balls underinflated 

'According to an NFL source with direct knowledge of the situation, referee Walt Anderson inspected all 24 of the Patriots’ footballs with a pressure gauge supplied by the league, as well as all 24 footballs from the Colts' reports The Boston Globe. 

'All 48 footballs were found to be within the allowable range of 12.5-13.5 pounds per square inch.' 

Furthermore, when officials decided to swap out the 12 balls at the half, they grabbed the other 12 that had previously been tested, and were properly inflated.  

As for why Jackson, and why he tossed the football he intercepted to a member of the Colts' equipment staff after he picked off Brady, he claims he just wanted a 'souvenir,' and that anything that happened after that is 'beyond' him.

'I don't know how it got to this point,' he said.

'Somehow I'm in the middle of it.' 

He even went so far as to say he thought the entire thing was 'comical' when he first heard about it on Monday.

Jackson also addressed rumors that the Colts organization had noticed that the Patriots were playing with underinflated balls earlier this year during a regular season game in November, saying that no one on the coaching staff told the players to look out for anything on Sunday and that they were all just focused on the game.

His fellow teammate and Pro Bowler, safety Mike Adams, also seemed eager to downplay the Deflategate scandal on Thursday, telling reporters; 'I'm not going to even touch that subject.' 

Others however, especially former players, are calling for the NFL and Goodell to come down hard on the Patriots, specifically Brady, with many former players saying there is no possible way the quarterback had nothing to do with the team's underinflated balls on Sunday.

Some are also none too happy the Goodell (center) spent Sunday before the game with his good friend, Patriots owner Robert Kraft (second from right)

Brady shocked many at a press conference on Thursday (above) when he said the NFL had yet to even speak to him about the underinflated balls

At a press conference Thursday afternoon Brady told reporters; 'I would never do anything outside of the rules of play.'

He then added of his pregame ritual; '

When I pick those footballs out, at that point, to me, they're perfect. I don't want anyone touching my balls after that. I don't want anyone rubbing them, you know, putting any air in them, taking any air out. To me, those balls are perfect and that's what I expect when I show up on the field.' 

Not buying that is former Dallas Cowboys star Troy Aikman, who, like Brady, has three Super Bowl rings, and who told a Dallas radio show; 'It's obvious that Tom Brady had something to do with this.'

This sentiment, expressed by many, makes Brady's statement yesterday the neither the NFL or Goodell has sat down with him to talk about what happened even more shocking. 

Not helping matters either is the fact that Goodell spent the hours before Sunday's game enjoying some time with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a longtime pal.

Some are saying that Brady should be benched and replaced by backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (above in 10 behind Brady) for next Sunday's start

Even Patriots fans have reached their breaking point with the team, with the Boston Globe saying if the team truly had nothing to do with the scandal they need to come out and make it clear now.

Because, as it looks now, despite the fact that Brady may get his fourth Super Bowl ring a week from Sunday, tying him with all-time greats Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw, and coach Bill Belichick may join former Pittsburgh Steelers Chuck Noll as the only other man with four Lombardi trophies,  the team has lost their claim as the greatest football dynasty of all time.

'But the most important thing - the Patriot legacy - is lost,' writes Dan Shaugnessy. 

'The Patriots and their fans will never win the best ever argument. Everything is tainted. Footballs (reportedly) have been doctored, headlines have been written, and opinions have been formed.'  

There is however a chance that this scandal could lead to a new era in Patriots football, especially if the league decides to bench Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo steps in for next Sunday's start.
