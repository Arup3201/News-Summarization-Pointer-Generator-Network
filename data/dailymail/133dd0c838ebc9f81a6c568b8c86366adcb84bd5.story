Archaeologists in Panama have made a surprising discovery, unearthing a collection of mysterious shaman's stones that have been hidden from view inside a cave for nearly 5,000 years.

The dozen rocks of various shapes and sizes were uncovered in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama. They are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of shamanic rituals in that part of Central America, according to researchers.

Charcoal found directly underneath the geological stash in the back of a small, prehistoric cave was carbon-dated to 4,800 years ago, while a second fragment of charcoal above the stones was dated to 4,000 years ago, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama reported Monday.

The findings were published online December 27 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, LiveScience reported.

The 12 rocks were found clustered tightly together, suggesting that several millenniums ago, they were brought by a healer or shaman in a bag, which had since long disintegrated.

The rock shelter where the find was made has been known to researchers since the 1970s.

In 2006, Ruth Dickau, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the UK, took another look at the location and determined that contrary to previous beliefs, it had been used by people as a shed for cooking and tool-making for over 9,000 years.

It was during a dig at the site that Dickau stumbled upon the mysterious pile of stones, among them translucent quartz, pyrite, magnetic rocks.

Some of the rocks contained grains of iron and showed magnetic properties by deflecting a compass needle.

Study co-author and consulting geologist Stewart Redwood said in a statement that the shamanic stones originated from a remote, gold-rich region of Panama known as the Central Cordillera up to 3,000 years before gold prospecting began there.

'We will never be entirely sure how the ancient people used the stones in the past,' Dickau wrote.

To this day, shamans in Costa Rica chant and blow tobacco smoke over crystals to make contact with spirits or diagnose an illness.
