Small change: Christoffel Hendrik Wiese, worth £3billion, claims carrying large sums of cash is not unusual

A South African billionaire says he should not have been treated with suspicion for trying to board a plane with nearly £700,000 in cash - because that amount of money is peanuts to him.

Customs Officers seized £674,920 from Dr Christoffel Hendrik Wiese at London City Airport in 2009 and a judge later ordered the money be forfeited as 'the proceeds of criminal activity'.

But Dr Wiese, who is South Africa's third-richest man, has launched a High Court bid to claw back the cash, citing his entirely clean criminal record in the UK and abroad.

His barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, told the court: 'The amount of money was consistent with Dr Wiese's stated wealth, representing less than two weeks' income and a minute fraction of his assets.'

Dr Wiese - worth an estimated £3billion - is the largest single shareholder in Africa's biggest supermarket, Shoprite, as well as having investments in mining and wine companies, according to Forbes.

The High Court heard that on April 27, 2009 customs officials found £120,000 in his hand luggage as he went to board a flight to Luxembourg and more than £500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold.

Dr Wiese explained the money came from diamond deals in South Africa in the 80s and 90s, and had been kept in a safety deposit box in the Ritz hotel because of foreign exchange restrictions in his homeland, lawyers for the UK Border Agency said.

More than £400,000 was in used notes, bundled together with elastic bands, nearly £7,000 was in Scottish currency and around £5,400 was in a 'mutilated' state, the court heard.

Dr Wiese told officials he was going to invest the money in Luxembourg and was due to fly back later that same afternoon.

However, District Judge Snow, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court the following year, ruled the huge value of the cash and the insecure method of transporting it meant the money should be seized as the proceeds of crime.

Dr Wiese is now challenging that decision at the High Court, claiming the UK Border Agency had not a shred of evidence linking him to criminal activity, and his enormous wealth meant it was not suspicious for him to be carrying such a large sum in cash.

Miss Montgomery told the court: 'Dr Wiese was a man of good character whose wealth could be traced to legitimate and extensive business activities. There was no evidence that he had any criminal associates in the UK or South Africa.

'Dr Wiese told no lies to the Customs Officers. He answered their questions without recourse to legal advice. He assisted in the process of questioning without protest at any point.'

The UK Border Agency argue the judge was entitled to make the finding he did on the 'startling' facts of the case and considering Dr Wiese had no documentation backing up his account.

Mr Justice Underhill, who will decide whether to quash the ruling and hand back the money, reserved his judgment, which will be given at an unspecified date in the future.
