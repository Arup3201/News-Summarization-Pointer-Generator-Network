Sharina Star tells how to spot a fake psychic

People spend their whole lives looking for answers and guidance but with endless supposed psychics available on the market there is too much potential for soul searchers to be ripped off.

So Daily Mail Australia asks celebrity psychic, Sharina Star, how to spot the difference between a genuine and fake psychic.

Star, 56, has been open to the spiritual world since she survived a near-death experience at just 10- years-old after being abducted, beaten and then left to die in Gymea in southern NSW.

'I know it sounds stupid - it was nothing much but I just  heard this voice say 'You're going to be OK' - it was nothing more than that but no one believed me - they just thought I was hallucinating - and then the next minute I heard the police sirens,' she said.

'I think that had something to do with it - but everyone has an awakening experience.' 

Star believes that anyone who is open to the possibility can become a psychic - however, that's not to say that there aren't frauds out there trying to make a quick buck anyway they can.

Star offers some handy tips on how to carefully choose a psychic that genuinely wants to help you rather than trying to dig deep into your pockets.

The first rule of thumb is to make sure the psychic is a reputable source:

Star says to do your homework on the person you are going to see or take recommendations through word of mouth.

'Beware of someone who is actually out there that you've never heard of and they make all of these ridiculous claims,' Star advises.

'If you have had good reports on a person that is better -  the biggest claim to fame is not necessarily the better one than the little lady down the street because a lot of the time they don't deliver.'

If you are told you have a spell or a curse cast on you - ignore it:

'I think the worst thing is the spells. I've got so many people say they have got these evil curses and they are convinced they have these curses on them.'

'I've tried to tell them everyone goes through bad luck and you've just to work through your bad luck to get your good luck.'

'Be positive with what you are a dealt but it takes a lot to change that around.'

Don't be fooled into thinking you have a curse or a spell - it's all nonsense according to Star

Avoid psychics when you are feeling vulnerable: 

'Be careful when are you are in time of grief because you can really get ripped off.' 

'A good psychic would send someone to a counsellor - but say you've got someone who wants to speak to a dead person everyday - there are people trying to milk them for money all of the time.'

Frauds will prey on those who are feeling at their most vulnerable, Star warns.

'If you see them once and you feel good that's OK, but if they keep wanting to see you and keep taking your money that's a bad sign.'

Hotlines can also be a trap for those who feel that they have nowhere else to turn.

'People just keep ringing the 1800 numbers - they get on the line because they just split up with their boyfriend - they will end up spending a lot of money.' 

Don't believe everything you are told:

Star met a 40-year-old woman who was told when she was just 14-years-old that she would never have children.

'Nobody should says things like that - if you're wrong that plants a seed,' Star says.

'I looked at her palm and told her it looked like she would have two children then I went and had my baby - it does make you psychic having your own baby - any woman will tell you that.'

'Then I went back to the job a few months later and the woman was pregnant. I don't know if she ended up having two but it gives me a lot of joy to see that.'

Sharina Star is one of Australia's most popular psychics with a host of celebrity clients and currently hosts a weekly show, Psychic Encounters, on Radio 2UE Sydney and contributes regularly to publications around Australia. 

Sharina's Fortune Reading Cards are also available now for $24.99 through Rockpool Publishing
