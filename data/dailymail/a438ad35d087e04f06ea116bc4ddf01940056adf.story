Zlatan Ibrahimovic chested home a controversial 72nd-minute winner for Paris Saint-Germain against Saint Etienne to ease the pressure on coach Laurent Blanc - but his goal sparked furious scenes at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

The Swede's unorthodox finish was a piece of brilliant improvisation yet it forced a fantastic save from St Etienne goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier, who clawed the ball back from beyond the line.

Although replays clearly show that the ball crossed the line, home supporters were incensed by the decision to award the goal and threw bottles and other missiles on to the pitch.

This forced a 10-minute delay in proceedings as fans were asked to calm down and re-take their seats - with referee Said Ennjimi taking the players off the field as a precaution.

St Etienne boss - and a candidate for Newcastle United's vacant head coach position - Christophe Galtier even had to intervene, walking across to different stands and asking supporters to calm down.

Despite the frantic scenes, little more than 15 travelling supporters were left elated by Ibrahimovic's League Cup quarter-final winner which bought his manager some extra time in the hotseat.

PSG had failed to win each of their last three Ligue 1 matches and the defending champions are languishing in fourth place in the table - one-point behind St-Etienne, three behind Marseille and a full four behind leaders Lyon.

But Sweden forward Ibrahimovic's goal saw PSG move into the last four of the French League Cup and give Blanc a stay of execution at the very least. 

After Ruffier saved winger Lucas' effort midway through the second half, Ibrahimovic put PSG ahead in the 72nd minute when he chested in Lucas' cross from the right, although Ruffier was adamant he had scooped the ball away before it crossed the line.

Earlier, Bastia beat nine-man Rennes 3-1.
