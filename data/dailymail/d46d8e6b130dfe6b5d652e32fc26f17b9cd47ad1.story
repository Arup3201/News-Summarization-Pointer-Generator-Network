Taking selfies at Sydney's most iconic landmarks is nothing out of the ordinary – for most people.

But one teenager is roping unsuspecting tourists and pedestrians into his photos, and is gaining a following for uploading the hilarious results online.

Damien King, 18, started his YouTube channel two months ago and in that time his 'selfies with strangers' videos have received more than 100,000 views.

His formula is simple – he switches on the camera on his phone and walks up to strangers to take a selfie, and then records their perplexed reactions.

His most recent video - themed for the FIFA World Cup - saw him walk around Sydney's Circular Quay and Darling Harbour in a Socceroos jersey and with a whistle to take selfies with people wandering around.

His victims give him mixed reactions, with some screaming, some swearing at him and others asking him what he's doing.
