Britain will shiver tonight as temperatures plummet in the first taste of what promises to be one of our coldest winters for a century.

The cold snap is expected to last until the end of the week, creating dangerous conditions on the roads and adding to the misery of those already battling floods.

Temperatures could fall to as low as minus 3°c (27°f) in some places, with snow already falling in the Pennines. In Saltburn, North Yorkshire, northerly winds have become so strong that they are pushing water back up a cliff.

The torrential rain which has deluged 
the country for the last week is expected to ease at last but the 
clearer skies, coupled with northerly winds, will send the mercury 
plummeting.

Tonight’s cold snap heralds a 
freezing winter ahead with long-range forecasters warning that 
temperatures could fall to as low as minus 20°c (4°f) in some areas 
through December and January.

The
 cold, drier spell that starts tonight could be only a brief respite 
from the rain. More heavy showers are expected to return early next 
week, causing more misery to those trying to combat flood damage.

‘The weather will be much colder and drier across most of the UK today,’ said Meteogroup forecaster John Lee.

‘Northerly
 winds and clearer skies will make it feel much colder and we can expect
 widespread frost overnight when temperatures drop below freezing.

‘Wintry
 showers will bring sleet, snow and hail to higher ground tomorrow and 
there’s a risk of heavy snow showers in northern Scotland on Friday.

Local authorities say they are prepared for a harsh winter and have taken steps to avoid a repeat of two years ago, when a lack of gritters and snowploughs caused roads and transport networks to grind to a halt.

The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said councils had stockpiled 1.3million tons of road salt and had ‘hundreds’ of gritters on standby.

‘Keeping the country moving is a community effort,’ said Peter Box, chairman of the LGA’s economy and transport board.

‘Councils
 will be treating as  many roads as they can and have  also installed 
and filled thousands of extra grit bins for people living in  side 
streets, villages and housing estates.

‘They’ve
 given equipment to  parish councils, community groups and snow wardens 
who have volunteered to grit hard-to-reach areas, and farmers will be 
helping out on country lanes.

‘Highways,
 street-cleaning and park staff could also be drafted in to help clear 
snow and ice around places like shops, schools and sheltered 
accommodation.’

He
 said councils would be using  social media, including Twitter feeds and
 Facebook pages, to keep people up to date about how weather is 
affecting their area.
