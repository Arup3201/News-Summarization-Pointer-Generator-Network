Poor old Bebe, supporters can be cruel. He’s one of those players for whom cheers are perhaps worse than boos, knowing as he must the irony that they carry.

He was given what must have seemed to the uninitiated a nice reception when his place in Benfica’s starting line-up was announced. No-one else in his side came close to drawing such a reaction, and neither did any player in the Valencia squad.

His £7million move to Manchester United in 2010, sight unseen, remains one of English football’s great curiosities. But here he is, recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League.

Potential: Bebe never made a Premier league appearance for Manchester United, but played well on loan

Opener: Vanderley Dias Marinho, otherwise known as Derley, opens the scoring for Benfica against Valencia

For the 24-year-old it’s a fresh chance, an opportunity for this young man of tough origins to return to his homeland and get his career on to a positive trajectory.

But he knows that with the riches of a stay at Manchester United he has also earned a certain amount of ridicule in this country. Of course, it’s faintly ludicrous and quite obviously unfair.

He didn’t set the amount, he didn’t choose to be less than spectacular in four years at Old Trafford. His judgements were never the ones in question. But he will always be a figure of fun because he was a central aspect of a strange transfer that did not come off.

And so it transpired at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon. His touches were cheered, none more so than at the end of the first half when he took possession on the right and left Carles Gil on his backside. His cross to Jara bobbled a touch but it was just about fine.

Transfer: Former Manchester United forward Bebe moved to Benfica for less than half what United paid for him

Escape: Goal-scorer Derley escapes the attentions of Valencia's Dani Parejo during their Emirates Cup match

Valencia (4-2-3-1): Rodriguez; Barragán, Vezo, Otamendi, Gayà; Guardado, Parejo; Feghoul, Gil, Piatti; Alcácer

Benfica (4-3-3): Artur; Cancelo, Lindelöf, Sidnei, Benito; Almeida Teixeira, Bebé; Jara, Derley, Candeias.

That was the highlight; the rest acceptable. He swapped flanks a few times, occasionally taking the ball and getting up on his toes, jinking a little here, dropping a shoulder there. Then, as it looked like he might try something, he’d give a simple pass, usually backwards. No frills, no great effect.

In all, he was neither good nor bad. But then no-one was, except perhaps Jara. He made Benfica’s opener by robbing a defender and squaring for Derley to finish.

Pablo Piatti, also a fine player, hit the post at the other end, before Jara rattled the underside of the bar for Benfica. Bebe was part of the move, but only in a very minor way. He was cheered for his role, though.

Cushion: Andres Guardado celebrates scoring Valencia's third, giving his side a two-goal cushion

Jose Luis Gaya equalised in the second half for Valencia and Piatti then put them in front. Andreas Guardado, like Piatti, profited from Moraes Artur’s questionable goalkeeping and made it 3-1.

And Bebe? He kept at it and had a shot blocked in the second half. His runs got a bit more purposeful and he actually linked up play quite well. But by the then the cheers had stopped, starting up again only when he was substituted in the 70th minute.

Maybe he’ll come good in Portugal and shock everyone. Maybe.
