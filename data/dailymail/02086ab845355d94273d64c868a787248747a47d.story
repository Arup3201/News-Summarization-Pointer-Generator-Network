He is thought to be the most convicted person in Britain's legal history.

And Harry Hankinson, 64, shows no sign of giving up his thieving ways after he was shown to the dock for offence numbers 500 and 501 this week.

The light-fingered pensioner has been committing crimes for more than 45 years and has a criminal record 'second to none'.

His list of convictions includes 416 for theft, mainly shoplifting, seven for violence, four sexual offences, two crimes against property, 28 relating to police, courts and prison, and three drug offences.

Last week he was before magistrates yet again on two counts of theft. The Blackburn court was told he had asked an assistant at a Body Shop store in his home town of Bolton to point out their most expensive products and went on to steal them

Hankinson, who admitted the theft and stealing perfume worth £295 from Boots, was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on June 4, according to the Daily Mirror.

Catherine Allan, prosecuting, said Hankinson had appeared the day before at Bolton Magistrates' Court on other shoplifting charges.

She added: 'Within minutes of being bailed, he went into the ­shopping centre and committed these further offences.

'Clearly no bail conditions are going to stop him.'

Hankinson has been in prison before and celebrated a release in 2008 by taking his wife on a coach trip to Ripon.

But while browsing in the historic Yorkshire town, Hankinson helped himself to more than £1,000 worth of jewellery from two shops.

The thief even took jumpers and biscuits while visiting Edinburgh Woollen Mill shop.
