For Mark Cooper, the best phone call of Saturday night was one he made to his dad Terry.

Not because he could tell him how his Swindon team had ended Bristol City’s unbeaten record. But because he could make it at all.

Mark had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in Tenerife where Terry, England’s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 World Cup, was in intensive care following a life-or-death bowel cancer operation.

It was a personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the Football League’s youngest team to recover from a 5-0 FA Cup hammering at Cheltenham.

But on Saturday night the 45-year-old could enjoy calling to share the details of a successful day and how his side, with an average age of 21 and three quarters, had moved into League One’s automatic promotion places.

They had some help when City captain Wade Elliott got sent off after barely three minutes, but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker Michael Smith (right) finally picked his way through a packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time.

‘I couldn’t wait to speak to dad,’ admitted Mark. ‘He’s back home and just about on a level now where he can focus and talk. He was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs.

‘It was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break. We had three players called up then, so we had the weekend off and I managed to get out there for four days.

‘The doctors said it was touch and go. I had to get there. He was in intensive care the whole time, it wasn’t nice.

‘Thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he’s clear now and will keep recovering. He loves Bristol City and has such fond memories of his time there — as I do because that’s where I started as a player — but for once he’s probably happy they’ve been beaten.’

When the fixtures came out, this was the first his father had booked flights for from his Canary Island home, where he was based as Southampton’s chief European scout.

Mark’s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man, who was a stalwart in Don Revie’s all-conquering Leeds United teams of the 1960s — but after scrapping through non-League jobs at Tamworth, Kettering, Darlington and Telford he’s fallen on his feet.

Swindon is a club where chairman Lee Power, himself an ex-player, is building a strategy based on youth and a belief in passing football.

The budget is a measly £1.5million a year, a fraction of that spent by League One leaders City. But the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club a favoured destination for Premier League sides to send their young talent on loan.

Last season some of Tottenham’s best youngsters, including Ryan Mason, progressed at the County Ground. This time Southampton’s impressive England defender Jack Stephens, just 20, looked the pick of the potential.

‘The chairman has been brilliant. He’s an ex-player so he understands,’ Cooper said. ‘He put this club on a sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football. He wants to do that so we can bring young players through.’

Cooper knows it will take a miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt. It’s a long season and a trip to Peterborough next week will be a more immediate challenge.

But on Saturday night he could enjoy a small success. And more important, so could his dad.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Bradford have taken time to adjust to League One since promotion through the play-offs in 2013 — but clicked to end Preston’s unbeaten run at Deepdale which went back to December. 

They dominated after leading through Rory McArdle’s first-half header — and even when Joe Garner scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time, it took just 60 seconds for Mark Yeates to curl in a 20-yard winner.

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... 

More like what my eye couldn’t see — more than 117,000 people watched the 19 games in League One and Two on Saturday, yet the BBC don’t think it’s worth running The Football League Show on international weekends.

Derek Asamoah had not played English football since walking out of Shrewsbury in 2007. That’s until Carlisle gave him a shot — and the 33-year-old got his fourth goal in five in a 1-0 win over Accrington.

Roy Carroll earned top marks for commitment — catching a 5am flight from Bucharest to keep a clean sheet in Notts County’s 1-0 win at Coventry, just 17 hours after playing for Northern Ireland.
