Sickening journal entries revealing Steven Powell's obsession with his missing daughter-in-law Susan have been released, providing a disturbing glimpse into his spiraling love and sexual fantasies for her.

The Pierce County Sheriff's Office released almost 3,000 pages of evidence in the case against Steven Powell - who was sentenced to 30 months in prison in June on voyeurism charges for filming two of his neighbor's daughters.

Utah mom Susan Cox Powell has been missing since December 2009. Her husband Josh killed himself and their two sons earlier this year after taking a hatchet to their sons, aged five and seven, and setting their Washington state home alight. 

Both Josh and Steven were suspects in Susan's disappearance. Her body has never been found.

Jailed: Disturbing journal entries of Steve Powell, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison, have been released

Victim: Evidence relating to Powell's missing daughter-in-law Susan was not allowed to be used in the trial

Sick: The Pierce County Sheriff's Office released about 3,000 pages of evidence in the case against Steven Powell, including entries from his journals that detail his uncontrollable love for his daughter-in-law Susan Cox Powell

In passages from 17 spiral notebooks 
written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about
and urges towards Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes 
they would be together.

'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am 
right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem 
of her being married to my son.'

'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.'

'My biggest problem as well as my 
greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been 
madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan.'

'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.'

'I am now going crazy with desire for her but I do not regret any of it.'

'I would be devastated were I to find out Susan was dead from any cause. I am still so in love with her I can barely function.'

He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am 
right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem 
of her being married to my son.

'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.'

He also wrote: 'My biggest problem as well as my greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan.

'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.'

He admitted in the passages that he 
secretly recorded his daughter-in-law from as early as January 2003 and 
would watch videos of her while masturbating.

He admitted 'looking at her naked body
under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 
'sick' thing to do.

His obsession with her, he said, 
'represents the first time I’ve mentioned fetishes and what might be 
considered sociopathic. I mean, who looks under the bathroom door with a
mirror?'

The journal included countless photos 
of Susan and different parts of her body. He also revealed he stole some
of her belongings including her underwear, her hair and even discarded wax 
strips.

On May 11, 2010, police obtained a warrant to search a locked cabinet belonging to Powell. In it they found, as well as the photos he took of her, completely nude females bodies with the original heads replaced with Susan's.

He wrote more than 50 songs about her and secretly scanned her childhood diaries so he could read them at night.

But there is no hint in the passages 
that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he
made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is
what Josh Powell told police.

Hearing: Powell at today's sentencing, where he got a sentence much more lenient than prosecutors wanted

Stalker: Multiple photographs of Susan that appeared to be secretly taken were stuck to the book, like this one of her 'applying makeup'

Obsession: Steve Powell wrote 50 songs about his daughter-in-law as well as collecting her hair, leg wax strips and underwear

He also revealed he lost 20 pounds 
when she disappeared. Powell took two days off work also and wrote in 
his journal that she was his reason for living.

He wrote at this time: 'I would be devastated were I to find out Susan was dead from any cause. I am still so in love with her I can barely function.'

Powell eventually told his 
daughter-in-law how he felt about her, but she responded by refusing to 
speak to him for five months and asking Josh to break contact with his 
father.

After this he wrote in his journal: 'I am now going crazy with desire for her but I do not regret any of it.'

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, he sold the house he raised his children in to buy a bigger one  in case she one day agreed to marry him.

There is also a lack of journal entries between October 2009 and April 2010 and then again between October 2010 and January 2011.

The final entry that was released appears to be from January 15, 2011, when Powell talked about a dream he had playing a piano to co-workers on a bus.

Steve Powell was convicted in May of 
14 counts of voyeurism for filming two of his neighbor's daughters, then
aged nine and eight, during 2006 and 2007.

He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.

It was also revealed that authorities 
investigating the Utah mother's disappearance almost immediately began 
classifying the case as a murder and kidnapping probe as they focused 
largely on the woman's husband.

According to heavily redacted court 
documents released on Tuesday, as early as two days after Susan Powell 
was reported missing, authorities in their hometown of West Valley City,
Utah, were describing the case as a murder, kidnapping, unlawful 
detention and obstruction of justice probe.

Publicly, they would only say the case
remained active while sharing little else, and they never specifically 
labeled Josh Powell a suspect.

That was despite the fact that 
authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in 
which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her.

Family: Powell's son Josh killed himself and his two children Charlie and Braden in February this year

Tragedy:

two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit

Utah authorities maintain the 
investigation remains active and open, but said the documents reveal 
their painstaking efforts to close the case and find Susan.

The records help 'make the public 
aware, to some extent, of what's been going on', West Valley City police
Sgt Mike Powell said on Tuesday. 'We've been working diligently and 
very hard on this investigation.'

Josh Powell had always maintained his innocence in his wife's disappearance and said he had taken the couple’s boys, then two and four, on a midnight camping trip in freezing temperatures the night she disappeared.

When questioned about his impromptu late-night camping trip, Powell told authorities he was testing out a new generator, according to the documents.

Charles Cox, Susan’s father, has said one of the Powell’s sons told social workers his mother came along on the midnight camping trip but was 'in the trunk'.

One of the children told investigators that his mother had gone on the camping trip 'but decided to stay and not come home', according to the records released on Tuesday.

Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan 
Powell's parents, said that's not good enough. She has been fighting for
the release of the entire case file under a Utah law that provides 
victims the same rights and access to investigative records as criminal 
defendants.

'We'll keep making attempts to get the
full measure of the records,' Ms Bremner said on Tuesday. 'Until I'm 
satisfied that I have everything, my clients have instructed me to keep 
going forward.'

While accusations continue to fly that
authorities could have done more to protect the Powell's two sons, 
Susan Powell's parents have insisted all along that police had enough 
circumstantial evidence to charge Josh Powell.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said police were still trying to 'put together the strongest case they could'.

'They didn't have a body. They didn't 
know the manner in which she died,' Mr Gill said on Tuesday. 'This was a
complex matter and it continues to be.'
