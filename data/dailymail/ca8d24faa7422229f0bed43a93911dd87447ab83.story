Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Manchester City’s chances of retaining the Barclays Premier League hinge on them beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge after a crushing 2-0 defeat against Arsenal.

City were beaten at the Etihad when Santi Cazorla converted a disputed 24th minute penalty and the outstanding Olivier Giroud finished off City with a 67th minute header.

The defeat means Pellegrini’s stumbling side are five points behind Chelsea, who beat Swansea 5-0 on Saturday, ahead of their clash at Stamford Bridge on January 31.

Pellegrini, who was unable to explain City’s dreadful performance, said: ‘The game we must play at Stamford Bridge is a very important game. 

‘We must close the gap to two points. I hope we are going to recover and play the way we are playing so far. With the ball we didn’t have clear ideas.

‘Chelsea will be a very decisive game. We will try to win that game to close that gap again.

‘We didn’t play a good game. We ran a lot and had a lot of possession but we didn’t have creative ideas to try and find the space against a team that defend very well.’ 

Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the 24th minute when Nacho Monreal appeared to go down easily after a collision with City captain Vincent Kompany. Cazorla converted to put Arsenal ahead.

Pellegrini added: ‘I doubt it was a penalty but after the penalty we have enough time. I don’t remember just one save from Joe Hart. We didn’t create many chances to score.

‘There are two principal reasons we lost. One was the penalty, which changed the game. I don't think it was a penalty, but it was unnecessary for Kompany to do it. 

‘We were not creative - we didn't have the ideas to cause damage in their defence. Without creativity it is difficult to score goals.

‘The movement of Kompany allows Monreal to dive. I am not saying it was a bad mistake of the referee. The penalty changed the game, but it was not the reason we lost. Of course, I always give credit to the team that wins the game. Arsenal played very concentrated. 

‘We ran the whole game, pressed very well, but we didn't have the ideas of how to create the space in their defence.’ 

Arsenal were impressive throughout and this was an important victory after wins for Southampton, Manchester United and Tottenham on Saturday.

Wenger’s side moved into fifth place in the Premier League and are just three points behind third placed Southampton with 16 games left of the season.

The Arsenal manager even claimed his team should have won more comfortable after Giroud added their second.

He said: ‘After we scored the first goal we controlled it and looked dangerous. We have good solidarity and the regret is that we did not always take advantage of the situations we created because we could have scored more.

‘It is good because we have injured players back and they have been out for a long time. It is an important period, but some of our players are in really good form.

‘What is for sure is that it increases the level and belief because we have five months in front of us. Games like that can help.’ 

Wenger also admitted that his team were fortunate to earn a penalty when Monreal went down.

The Arsenal chief added: ‘My initial reaction was penalty. Someone told me it was a bit fortunate, but it goes for both teams.

‘The referee has to make a quick decision and I am in favour of some support for offsides and penalties.’
