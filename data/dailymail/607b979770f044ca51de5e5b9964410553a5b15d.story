Iker Casillas has lifted the lid on the deterioration of his relationship with former Spain team-mate Xabi Alonso, and told Jose Mourinho – Carlo Ancelotti is a better coach than you.

Casillas and Alonso founds themselves on different sides of a divided dressing room under Mourinho with Alonso a staunch defender of his manager and Casillas never hiding his disapproval for the current Chelsea coach's methods.

When he joined Bayern this summer there was little love lost between Alonso and Casillas and the cold war continued when the midfielder said that Manuel Neuer was 'by far the best goalkeeper' he had ever played with.

'I am not interested in what Xabi says,' Casillas told Spanish radio Cadena Cope. 'In the last few years the relationship (with him) has not been the best. It's no big deal. 

'You get on better with some players than others. We have had a very different time of it in the last few years. Some people have praised the way he behaved and others have praised the way I behaved.'

Asked about Mourinho, Casillas said: 'If I saw him I would shake his hand of course. Then it would be up to him to shake mine or not.' Asked to compare his current boss Ancelotti with his former coach he said: 'Ancelotti has been a player and I think he is a better coach than Mourinho.'

Real Madrid's most-decorated goalkeeper also made it clear he has no intention of giving up his place as the club's goalkeeper any time soon.

Amid speculation that Real Madrid want David De Gea to move to Spain from Old Trafford, Casillas said: 'I want to finish my contract that runs until 2017 by which time I will be 36. I want to get back to being considered the best goalkeeper in the world.'
