Jeff Wright's balloon costumes have the air of something special - but he'll need to steer clear of sharp objects.

By twisting and shaping balloons, Mr Wright has turned himself into Toy Story hero Buzz Lightyear and Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

He has also managed to transform himself into Nintendo character Super Mario riding his dinosaur sidekick Yoshi.

Mr Wright, 28, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'It wasn't the first odd whim that had taken me, it wasn't the last, but it stuck.

'Balloon twisting is fun for me because although I have a pretty good grasp on the performing arts, I can't even draw a convincing stick figure.

'It's nice to actually be decent at a visual art, as I've always envied artists with talent in drawing, painting, sculpting.'

Mr Wright's Buzz Lightyear costume, which he calls 'my pièce de résistance', caught the eye of Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich, who posted a tweet about it.

He said: 'The reactions I get with the balloons are incredible because they're such a novelty.

'Someone could make the exact same costume out of foam or cloth, and it wouldn't get the same response because people can wrap their heads around the idea of those materials as building/costuming materials.

'Balloons just blow their minds.

'They've seen a sword or a dog and then in walks a monster made out of balloons.'

The artist now puts on shows for orphans in Cochabamba in Bolivia, South America, where he and his nurse wife Rachel are volunteering.

He added: 'We sing songs, play games, and learn about God's love for His children.

'I have also spent a few weekends teaching some of the boys at the home how to twist balloons.

'I've definitely been well prepared professionally for what I am doing here.

'Last week - as I'm making a fruit hat out of balloons and teaching a silly song to go with it to a village full of children that have never had running water, let alone internet - someone is posting a photo of my Buzz costume on Reddit.

'It's gone viral.'
