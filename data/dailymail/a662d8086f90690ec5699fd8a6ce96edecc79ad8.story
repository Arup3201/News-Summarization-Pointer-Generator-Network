A couple due to marry died when their car rolled off a cliff while they were looking for a romantic location to spend their honeymoon.

Li Huang, 31, and his fiancée, Gao Yu, 29, were exploring the mountains in Qianjiang District, near Chongqing city, weeks ahead of their wedding when they veered off a dirt track road.

Both survived the sheer 160-foot drop but died later of their injuries. 

Tragic: Li Huang, 31, and his fiancée Gao Yu, 29, were looking for a honeymoon spot when they fell off this cliff

They were found conscious beside their mangled car at the bottom of deep ravine by a passer-by, police said.

He called the emergency services but they were unable to save the couple. 

Ambulance spokesman Peng Tai said: 'We tried to resuscitate them but we had no idea how long they'd been there and they were both very badly injured.

'Both of them died at the scene from multiple injuries.'

Friends say the couple were taking a holiday to plan their upcoming wedding later this year and had been surveying possible honeymoon locations.

Drop: The couple survived the 160ft drop but died later from their injuries, weeks before their wedding

Police spokesman Yul Teng said: 'The mountainous area where they were found is well known as a tourist attraction and people often stop to park there to take in the view.

'It is, however, very dangerous and even though there are barriers there are several fatalities every year.

'It may be that they parked and the car rolled on or that the driver misjudged the cliff edge while parking and went over.'

He added: 'We're investigating, but it seems like it was just a tragic accident.'
