Parents can be held liable for what their children post on Facebook, the Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled.

The court has decided that the parents of seventh-grade student, Dustin Athearn, may be negligent after failing to get him to delete a fake Facebook profile that allegedly defamed his classmate Alexandria Boston.

The decision could now set a legal precedent on the issue of parental responsibility over their children’s online activity.

The case dates to an incident in May 2011, when Athearn from Palmer Middle School in Kennesaw created a Facebook profile pretending to be his classmate  Boston, reports Courthouse News Service.

Using a ‘fat face’ app, he manipulated a photo he’d taken of the girl to make her look obese. He also added to the unauthorized profile included graphically sexual and racist comments, references to Boston's purported homosexual orientation, and other offensive material. 

The profile also falsely stated that Boston was taking drugs for mental health disorders, as well as illegal drugs, according to a October 10 ruling.

The account was then connected to more than 70 Facebook users via invites Athearn sent to Boston's classmates, teachers and family.

Should parents be liable for what their children post on Facebook?

Boston’s parents complained to the school about Athearn’s actions and he was given two days of in-school suspension. The school also alerted his parents, who grounded him for a week.

However for the next 11 months the page remained live until April 2012. 

It wasn’t deleted until Facebook deactivated the account shortly after Boston's parents sued Athearn and his parents in state court.

The girl’s lawyer says the child’s parents didn’t immediately confront the boy’s parents because their school refused to identify the culprit for confidentiality reasons.

The Bostons, who sought damages for libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claimed the Athearns made no efforts to view the defamatory posts or to compel their son to delete them after they found out about them.

The Cobb County Superior Court initially dismissed the Bostons' negligence claims against the parents, but on Friday the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that decision.

They found that a jury should determine whether the Athearns failed to supervise their son's use of the computer and internet account relating to the alleged defamation.

‘Given that the false and offensive statements remained on display, and continued to reach readers, for an additional eleven months, we conclude that a jury could find that the [parents'] negligence proximately caused some part of the injury [the girl] sustained from [the boy's] actions (and inactions),’ wrote Judge John Ellington.

Although the Athearns could not anticipate that their son would use the computer in a harmful way, once they found out about the creation of the fake profile, they had a duty to supervise his computer activities, the 15-page ruling states.

'While it may be true that Alex was harmed, and the tort of defamation had accrued, when even one person viewed the false and offensive postings, it does not follow that the Athearns' parental duty of reasonable supervision ended with the first publication,' wrote Ellington.
