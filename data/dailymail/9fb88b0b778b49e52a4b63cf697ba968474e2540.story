The family of a legally blind inmate who died after falling down a flight of stairs outside Manhattan Criminal Court is suing New York City.

Apolinar Solis, 51, fell as he was being taken from a holding pen outside a courtroom to an NYC Department of Correction pen in November 2013.

The Harlem resident fractured his skull and was taken to New York Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital for surgery.

Solis, who remained conscious afterwards, died from brain swelling and a blood clot two days later.

The family has now filed a suit in Manhattan Supreme Court which claims he should never have been allowed to climb the courthouse stairs.

The suit, which was filed by Solis' daughter on behalf of his estate, alleges her father needed a wheelchair because of a large ulcer that had developed on his foot while he was in custody.

He was blind in one eye, suffered from diabetes and needed regular dialysis for his kidneys.

Solis had been arrested in October and was taken into custody because he couldn't make bail. 

He was held in an infirmary on Rikers Island before coming into the city to appear before a judge on charges of cocaine possession.

According to the lawsuit, the emergency workers who treated Solis never applied ice to his head.

'Basic first aid was lacking,' the family's lawyer, Ilya Novofastovsky, told the New York Daily News.  

The suit, which charges New York City and Rikers health care provider Corzon Health Inc with malpractice, negligence and violating Solis’ civil rights, is seeking unspecified damages. 

'The family is looking for answers,' Novofastovsky told Gothamist in 2013. 

'What we're trying to get to is transparency from officials. 

'The family wasn't even told he was in the hospital until somebody from the hospital tipped them off. 

'Their loved one was manhandled and died, and they simply want an explanation and information about what his last moments were like.'

A spokesman for the city's Law Department said the matter is under review.
