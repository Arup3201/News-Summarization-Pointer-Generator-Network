A top surgeon who interrupted a photo opportunity for David Cameron and Nick Clegg has gone on leave.

David Nunn, a leading hip replacement specialist, burst in on the pair when they were visiting patients at Guy's Hospital in  Central London last week.

Mr Nunn complained about some of the Prime Minister's aides and journalists covering the visit not having their sleeves rolled up - a hospital hygiene stipulation - before being ushered outside.

Startling: Nick Clegg and David Cameron look taken aback after surgeon David Nunn burst in last week. His bosses claim he 'requested' leave

The pair were with a group of aides 
and journalists at Guy's Hospital in central London last week when David
Nunn, a leading hip replacement surgeon, burst in.

Appearing to object to some members 
of the group not having their sleeves rolled up, he told them: ‘Excuse 
me, I'm the senior orthopaedic surgeon in this department. Why is it 
that we're all told to walk around like this and these people...’

He was then drowned out by a perplexed-looking Mr Cameron and his aides who rushed forward to smooth things over.

They swiftly ushered the Prime Minister and the offending group out of the room - and away from rolling cameras.

The medic was heard shouting ‘I'm not having it’ from outside the room.

Now it has emerged he has gone on leave – and it is not known when he will return.

The surgeon who disrupted David Cameron's photo opportunity is no stranger to media attention.

Senior
orthopaedic surgeon David Nunn, 57, caused a storm of controversy in 
2002, when he criticised foreign nurses for failing to understand his 
instructions.

Mr Nunn, 
who qualified in 1978 and is now regarded as one of the top hip 
replacement specialists in the country, claimed he had to stop an 
operation while his patient was still under the knife because assistants
did not understand his request for surgical instruments.

The
doctor, who has performed more than 1,000 hip revision replacement 
operations, accused the Government of setting 'arbitrary targets' for 
the NHS, adding that political correctness was stopping the issue of 
communication problems with foreign staff being raised.

'The
world has been scoured for nurses to shore up the health service and to
achieve arbitrary targets set by the government,' he told the Daily 
Telegraph at the time of the controversy.

'All
are without doubt well-trained and dedicated professionals, but if 
medical staff cannot communicate effectively then patients' care may be 
put at risk.'

Mr Nunn, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, has been a consultant at St Guy's Hospital since 1990.

He
is listed on the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council and
is also a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedics.

Yesterday one of Mr Nunn’s patients 
claimed he was told the  surgeon had been ‘suspended’ for his 
intervention, which was filmed by a BBC camera crew.

Peter Hodgson, 63, from Clapham, South London, was seen by Mr Nunn on the morning of the Prime Minister’s visit on June 14.

He returned for a follow-up 
appointment this week, and said: ‘The registrar said Mr Nunn was on 
gardening leave and had been reprimanded for what he did last week.’

It is understood that journalists in 
the group had checked with the ward sister whether they needed to wash 
their hands and roll up their sleeves, but were told it was not 
necessary as they were not coming into close contact with patients.

Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg had observed the drill because they were in contact with patients.

In a bid to prevent doctors speaking 
to the media about the issue, the Trust sent staff an internal memo 
warning them to keep quiet.

It read: ‘At this stage we do not 
know when Mr Nunn will return to the Trust. Staff should be aware that 
media may phone without identifying themselves as media.

‘It is imperative staff not answer any questions or provide information or personal opinions.’

Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust confirmed Mr Nunn was on leave but said he had requested it.

A spokesman said: ‘With David’s permission, we are able to confirm that he is currently caring for his elderly mother.’ 

Regarding the internal memo, the 
spokesman added: ‘It is normal Trust practice to provide staff with 
information and guidance in situations where they may receive queries 
outside their normal line of work, and to ensure media requests are 
managed according to the Trust’s media policy. 

‘This is to prevent misinformation and provide support for staff.’

Mr Nunn, 57, would not comment yesterday.
