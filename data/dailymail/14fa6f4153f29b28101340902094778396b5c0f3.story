Pete Carroll took full responsibility for the play call which resulted in the Seattle Seahawks losing their Super Bowl crown in dramatic fashion.

With 26 seconds to play, Seattle trailed 28-24 and were on second-and-goal on the New England one-yard line.

Marshawn Lynch had rushed for 102 yards and lined up in the backfield, seemingly ready to pound New England’s defense.

But quarterback Russell Wilson tossed a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette, cornerback Malcolm Butler read the play, and the rest is history.

‘I told those guys: “That’s my fault, totally”,’ Carroll said on NBC's postgame show. ‘But we had plenty of time to win the game... we were playing for third and fourth down, give them no time left... but didn't work out that way.’

‘We decided to call another call. We make these decisions every game all the time. They work out sometimes and they don’t other times. This one didn’t work out right for us.

‘We could have run it and got stuffed, we could run it and scored, we could have scored against their goal-line as well. I know that could have happened. It just wasn’t a great football thought at the time.’

And Carroll admitted he is struggling to comprehend the defeat.

‘It really hasn’t hit yet. I’m not in that position where I can do that. I can’t go there. I’ve got to be in charge of what’s going on here. I can’t go there.’

Carroll's counterpart Bill Belichick said he was not surprised by the play call, adding: 'They’re goal-line plays. That didn’t surprise me,' Belichick said. 'They do a lot of things down there. We had to be ready for everything.'
