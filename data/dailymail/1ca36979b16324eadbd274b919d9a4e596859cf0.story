A ten-day inquest into the mysterious death of an American software engineer in Singapore ended on Monday with police admitting that they deviated from official protocols by not dusting for fingerprints or collecting DNA samples at the scene, and by examining his laptop computer.

Shane Truman Todd's body was found in his Singapore apartment by his girlfriend last June 24, and local authorities have claimed that he hanged himself.

But Todd's parents, Rick and Mary 
Todd, believe that he may have been murdered and left Singapore 
before the inquiry as they say they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process.

Tragic: Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher, was found hanged in his apartment in Singapore in June 2012. His parents believe he was murdered due to the sensitive research he was involved in

State counsel presented evidence of links to suicide websites on the 31-year-old's laptop and suicide letters written to family members and loved ones.

But the Todds think he could have been killed over his research in the U.S. into material used to make heat-resistant semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military applications.

The Todds have received assistance in the case from U.S. senators and the FBI.

Police Sgt. Muhammad Khaldun Bin Sarif was asked by government lawyers during the inquest as to why police had not ordered a further 
investigation of the apartment.

Bin Sarif  said that he and his partner had made 'a preliminary assessment' that pointed to suicide and determined there were 'no signs of foul play.'

He said the officers decided as a result 'not to perform fingerprint dustings or DNA swabs.'

Enough: Rick and Mary Todd believe their son was murdered last year in Singapore. They withdrew from the inquest on Wednesday, saying they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process

Dispute: Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said his government regrets the family's decision to leave the inquiry

Asked why he had deviated from police protocols by assessing a personal laptop at a crime scene, Khaldun said he had found two notes in Todd's apartment, one of which contained a password which he used to gain access to the laptop nearby.

Suspicion: Shane Todd's parents think he could have been killed over his research into a technology with both civilian and military applications

Khaldun explained that the protocol was only 'a guideline which can be deviated from.'

He said he and his partner made an 'operational decision' to assess Todd's laptop because the note containing the password 'was left there for a reason' and would help police in determining whether there was foul play involved.

Todd's family has asked why police accessed his laptop and cellphone even though such items are supposed to be handed over to forensic technology specialists.

The inquiry into Todd's death ended Monday, a day earlier than expected.

Lawyers for the Todd family were not present in court because they had been dismissed by Todd's parents, who left Singapore last Thursday after withdrawing from the inquest.

Friends of the Todds were also not present in court.

The Todds have said that while they were in Singapore, they found a hard drive in their son's apartment that contained thousands of documents he had backed up from his work computer.Â 

After having it analyzed by a 
computer forensics expert, they found a draft of a project outline 
between Singapore's Institute of Microelectronics - Shane Todd's former 
employer - and Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the development of a 
device that utilized gallium nitride.

The heat-resistant material has 
civilian uses in products like LED screens and cellphone towers, and 
military applications in things like radar and satellite systems.

Todd had been trained in the U.S. on 
proprietary equipment that produces the material but is restricted for 
export because of the potential military applications.

Huawei has said it had no cooperation
with the Institute of Microelectronics related to gallium nitride. IME 
has said neither Todd nor the company was involved in any classified 
research.

The Todds have said that their next step will be to urge a U.S. congressional investigation into their son's death.

'If our government wants to talk about industrial espionage and murder, we're more than willing to help,' Rick Todd said.

His son's body was found in 
his Singapore apartment by his girlfriend Shirly Sarmiento, a Filipino nurse, on June 24, 2012.

Police found no signs of forced entry into the apartment and he had no visible signs of injury on his body except redness on his forearms and legs.

Shirly Sarmiento had earlier told the inquest that he suffered from depression and that 
he had mounting unhappiness with the 'dishonest environment' in his 
workplace.

She also mentioned he feared 'heavy hands coming after him.'

His parents have said they consider the evidence presented by police to be fake.

Rick Todd said his son in early 2012 
had expressed concerns to his parents that he was being asked to 
compromise U.S. security. But he said Shane wasn't specific.

Mary Todd also said the alleged 
suicide note was obviously fake because it thanked the Institute of 
Microelectronics, the former employer he had grown to hate, and had 
other false details.

Witness: Shane's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento (center on May 14 with the Todd family) testified at the inquest into the 31-year-old death

Last Tuesday, a key witness in the ongoing inquest withdrew his initial claims that Todd was strangled. The state, meanwhile, introduced a witness who contradicts the parents' claim that their son was killed before June 23.

The parents, who traveled to Singapore from their home in Montana, issued a statement last Wednesday saying they would no longer participate in the inquest and return to the U.S.

'We have been told that the coroner's inquiry is not adversarial, rather it is a fact-finding mission with the sole purpose of getting to the truth,' the statement said.

'This has not been our experience. We no longer have confidence in the transparency in the findings of the system. It appears to us that the outcome has already been predetermined.'

The parents, who had been expected to testify at the inquest, also have said the crime scene at their son's apartment was compromised, with key computer evidence mishandled.

The FBI, however, has supported Singapore police claims that a hard drive found at Todd's apartment was handled by Singapore authorities who were checking for evidence, and not by an unknown person.

'We were looking forward to an honest and transparent court proceeding,' the parents' statement said. 'Sadly, this has not been the case. Therefore, we have decided that our presence in Singapore will have no bearing on the outcome of this case.'

Brothers: Shane Todd was one of four boys and his grieving family want to know the truth about his death

Warning: Shane Todd's father Rick said his son had become fearful for his safety due to the sensitive technological research he was engaged in

Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the government regrets the family's decision to leave the inquiry.

'For
reasons best known to them, they walked out and it's unfortunate that 
they decided to leave,' Shanmugam told a news conference.

'The
family had said previously that they had found the hard drive 
themselves, and they asserted that this hard drive had been processed by
a third party,' he said.

'It would have been useful to hear the family's side as to how they had come to a different view of the facts.'
