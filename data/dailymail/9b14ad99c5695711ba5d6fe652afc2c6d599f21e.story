This spectacular snowy route marks the border between Sweden and Norway - and is perfect challenge for adventure-loving snowmobilers.

But this group are quite literally treading on a thin line - because to their right is Norway where riding a snowmobile for fun is illegal while to their left is Sweden where it is allowed.

Strict laws in Norway mean unless it is work related, riding snowmobiles is against the law.

But photographer Havard Dalgrav, 25, and his friends were undeterred by the risk of ending up on the wrong side of the law and travelled four hours to the border to capture these stunning shots.

A bumpy ride: The snowy route is more than 1000 miles long - making it the longest border for either country

The incredible snowy terrain, home to wolves and brown bears, is more than 1000 miles long and is the longest border along either country.

Mr Dalgrav, from Oslo, Norway, discovered the route while travelling to Sweden for a snowmobile trip earlier this year.

He said: 'It's a really breath-taking sight - the track seems to go on forever and as much as I'd love to get to the end of it I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to.

'It looks natural but I'm sure the trees must have been removed to mark the border, maybe left from WWII or something when this was much stricter.

'When you zoom in on the internet using Google Maps you can actually see the gap on the border and follow it all the way along from top to bottom.'

But while the pictures may make the route appear to be as smooth as motorway, Mr Dalgrav revealed it was actually a rather bumpy ride.

He continued: 'It's about 10-15 metres wide and what you can't tell from the pictures is that it's really quite bumpy so you can't get the sort of speed you crave looking at the long straight line.

'The laws are quite unusual so a lot of us from university travel over to Sweden together. Just a few meters to the right and we would have been breaking the law.

'We discovered it in February this year and we decided to make it an annual trip. It was about -15c so when driving at 100kmh with the wind in your face it's pretty cold.

'Unfortunately due to the temperature my camera stopped working - thankfully it was after I got this shot of the route snaking along the border for miles into the distance.

'It was so much fun and it's not every day you see something this beautiful.'
