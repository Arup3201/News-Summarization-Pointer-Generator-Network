Van Dijk has impressed for the Scottish champions since joining from FC Groningen in 2013 and has been included in recent Holland squads.

Tottenham, Southampton, West Ham, Arsenal and Manchester City have also watched him over the past 18months.

Celtic have been scouting for a replacement and expect bids to be formalised next week.
