Casey Anthony, dubbed the most hated mother in America, had suspicions that she and her daughter Caylee shared the same father, according to her former defence attorney.

In his explosive new tell-all, the Florida woman’s lawyer Jose Baez accuses George Anthony of abusing his daughter, and speculates that George could have murdered 2-year-old Caylee to hide evidence of abuse.

Casey was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter after a highly-publicised trial last July.In his book, Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, Baez reveals aspects of the Anthony’s private lives that were not looked into during the trial.

The lawyer accused George of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse. Baez first made the shocking allegation at the trial’s opening statements, saying that George killed Caylee, disposed of the girl’s remains, and then lied about it to authorities.

Casey confided in Baez that she was worried her father might have fathered Caylee, because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant. DNA tests later revealed that George was not the father.

George, through a family attorney, denied ever abusing Casey.

However, Casey and her father have reportedly been estranged since October 14, 2008, the day, CF 13 News notes, that he testified against her, leading to the grand jury indicting her for murder.He testified in the trial: ‘I would have done anything I could to save my granddaughter.’

Someone in the Anthony house 
conducted several suicide-related searches on the family computer, 
including ‘fool-proof suffocation’ and ‘venturing into the pro-suicide 
pit’ on the day little Caylee Anthony vanished, Casey Anthony’s defence 
attorney Jose Baez said.

The
attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after
Casey’s father George Anthony said she left the home.

While
last year’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had 
searches for ‘chloroform,’ the suicide searches were not revealed, Baez 
said, because they were discovered after the fact.

He told Good Morning America: ‘I have
a hard time believing that law enforcement wouldn’t check the internet 
history of the day that the child went missing. That would have been 
bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out.’

Jose Baez, Casey Anthony's defense lawyer, has written a tell-all book about the case

Prosecutors claimed Anthony 
suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her 
boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife.

Baez said during the trial - repeated
again in his book - that Caylee accidentally drowned in a family 
swimming pool and that her father, George Anthony, hid the body. Baez 
also claimed George Anthony sexually abused his daughter.

George Anthony denied both 
allegations, and there was little brought up about them during the 
trial. Baez said the defence wasn't required to put on any such evidence
because proving the case is the prosecution's burden, not the other way
around.

George Anthony tried to commit 
suicide in January 2009, and was found in a Daytona Beach hotel after 
overdosing on prescription drugs. A five-page suicide note was also 
discovered at the hotel.

Baez told GMA that it was hard to 
determine who in the Anthony family conducted what searches on January 
16, 2008, but said it was possible to infer who searched what, based on 
the terms searched.

For instance, one of the terms 
searched was ‘foolproof suffocation.’ Baez noted that the terms were 
spelled incorrectly, and that George struggled with good spelling.

He wrote in his book: ‘By looking at 
the websites being researched, all concerned with suicide and death, it 
certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt-ridden 
George Anthony.’

In his book, Baez also lashes out at 
several entities - calling the media a 'monster', the police 'careless' 
and the prosecution 'scheming and ruthless'.

He wrote: 'This was not real life, it was the media's Casey Anthony
reality show, a show that depended on name-calling and controversy for 
television ratings.'

Evidence and testimony showed that Casey was a habitual liar, even making up fake friends and pretending 
every day to go to a job she didn't have at Universal Studios. Baez was asked whether 
Anthony's lies surrounding her daughter's disappearance might be 
indicative that she was guilty.

Casey Anthony during her trial when the jury heard her father say 
her car smelled of human decomposition. Baez revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body

Innocent: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today

'I don't think the lies are 
indicative of innocence or guilt,' he said. 'The lies were there long 
before Caylee passed away.' In the book, he says Anthony had built a 
'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of 
someone with 'serious mental health issues.'

Baez said one piece of prosecution 
evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had 
indicated a body may have been in the trunk of Anthony's car at one 
point and also that a body may have been in the backyard. None was 
discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of 
trash in the trunk.

But, he said, people - and jurors - believe in dogs.

'That concerned me a little bit. Most people really think dogs can do magic,' Baez said.

He also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to
a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering 
her two-year-old daughter Caylee, but Anthony adamantly insisted she had
nothing to do with the toddler's death.

New Look: The last time the public saw Casey was when this video was released in October. She is said to be living in Palm Beach, Florida

Baez said 
prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow Anthony to plead guilty to 
aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison.  
He said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in 
Anthony's best interest.

'There were times, difficult times, 
when the evidence didn't look good for Casey,' Baez said, adding that it
was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers.

The prosecution's flaw, he added, was
that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on 
Anthony's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog
options.

Overall, Baez attributed the strong 
public backlash against the jury's verdict to a lack of understanding 
about the judicial system and because 'a lot of people bought into the 
hype' that Anthony must have been guilty.

He noted that jurors who gave 
media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong 
evidence that never came.

'We need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred,' he said. 'That's where the focus should have been, and it never was.'

Baez declined to comment on what 
Anthony is doing these days and on how often he talks to her. He said he
promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his 
book, in which she did not participate. Anthony is living in an 
undisclosed location in Florida serving probation for an unrelated 
conviction, which Baez said ends on August 21.

Parents: George and Cindy Anthony both lied to cover up what really happened to Caylee, claims Baez

'She's doing a lot better than she was in prison,' Baez said, but then added: 'She's a prisoner of her own freedom.'

Anthony, he said, 'would not 
entertain it for a second'. As he became more familiar with the state's 
mostly circumstantial case, Baez said he grew convinced she would be 
acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except 
for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators.

'There was nothing in the trial that 
ever made me think Casey was guilty of anything as related to the 
murder,' Baez said. 'Every single piece of evidence favored us.'

He told CBS' Crimesider: 'I think Casey Anthony's story, the whole case, was a media phenomenon. And I say that because she was young, pretty and white.

'If it didn't have those elements to it I don't think it would have taken off.'

Prosecutors claimed Anthony 
suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her 
boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife.
