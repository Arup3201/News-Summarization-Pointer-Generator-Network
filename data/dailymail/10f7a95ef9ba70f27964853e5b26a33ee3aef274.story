A Thomson flight hit by a 22-hour delay from Cancun, Mexico, to Gatwick, saw passengers celebrating the New Year on the beach instead of in the air.

The flight was due to depart from Cancun at 4.10pm local time on New Year's Eve and fly overnight to arrive in London at 7.05 am on New Year's Day.

But instead, passengers spent New Year's Eve in a hotel on Mexico's Caribbean coast, after problems with the scheduling of cabin staff for the plane, apparently being delayed in Sweden, meant the aircraft was left sitting on the runway.

The Maloney family were able to see in the New Year on the beach in Cancun rather than in mid-air after a flight delay saw them spend an extra day in Mexico

The Maloneys were handed a special bonus with a New Year's Eve night at the Riu Caribe resort

The Maloney family, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, was among the passengers who were shuttled to the plush Riu Caribe beach resort, rated as 4T+ by the holiday company.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, father Chris Maloney, who had spent two weeks in the the five-star star all-inclusive Grand Bahía Príncipe Akumal, said: 'When we came down for breakfast on the day of departure, our tour guide came over and told us that the flight had been delayed.

'When she said by 22 hours I thought she was joking at first; but in the end it meant we got an extra day of holiday.

The family were treated to live dolphin shows at their hotel, and were able to sneak in an extra performance

'I'm not totally sure what the problem was; we were told the staff had been held up in Sweden, but it was crazy as the plane was just sitting there with nowhere to go.

'We were taken off to another hotel in Cancun, and the extra day we spent by the swimming pool, exploring Cancun, and getting some last-minute sun - the temperature was around 30 degrees.'

Incredibly, last year on their trip to annual Christmas trip to Mexico, the Maloneys, father Chris, mother Jo and sons Chris and Tom, were delayed 24 hours at Gatwick due to flood problems.

Their desperation to make it to the airport had seen the family of four take a taxi all the way from their home in Hatfield to Gatwick - a 70-mile journey and a £150 fare to boot.

Chris added: 'Last year was the full 24-hour, full-day delay, so I suppose this time we're two hours better off!

It's not a bad thing when a flight delay means an extra day's stay in Cancun, Mexico

'It's some contrast though; from travelling in a taxi to the airport to be told the flight is delayed last year and put up in an airport hotel, to getting an extra day in the Mexican sun this year.

'We really love this part of Mexico, I would highly recommend a family holiday here, so getting an extra day, despite the flight delay, isn't all bad. 

The family's flight out of Cancun was yesterday (Thursday) at 4.10pm local time, landing back in the UK at 7.27am this morning.

MailOnline Travel have contacted Thomson for comment regarding the delayed flight, and are awaiting a response. 

A spokesperson for Thomson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers travelling on flight TOM049 from Cancun, Mexico to London Gatwick Airport.

'The aircraft operating this flight was delayed on another route and as a result the flight had to be delayed further, due to mandatory crew rest restrictions. 

'Thomson provided customers with overnight accommodation and meals in a hotel in Cancun. All customers are now back in the UK after the aircraft landed at London Gatwick airport at 07.27 today (Friday).

'We would like to reassure customers that delays of this length are extremely rare.'
