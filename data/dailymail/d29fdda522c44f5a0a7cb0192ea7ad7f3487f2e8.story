Police have released a new picture of the prime suspect in the terrifying Las Vegas Strip shootout as they widen their manhunt.

The photograph of heavily-tattooed Ammar Harris was released as officers broaden their search for the 26-year-old, considered armed and dangerous, to the east coast.

Officers believe he opened fire from behind the wheel of a black Range Rover SUV, killing Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr and causing a fiery crash that left two others dead and five more injured.

Arrested: Ammar Harris was arrested by police in Los Angeles on Thursday, officers revealed today

Capt. Chris Jones, of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, said: 'We have him identified. Now the focus is on locating and apprehending him. We're getting help all over the place.'

He is described as having several 
distinctive tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and 
small heart on his upper right cheek.

Police have also revealed that Harris, an alleged pimp, has a length criminal history, which includes charges of sexual assault, kidnap and robbery.

The manhunt has been extended to the southeastern states, with police already searching Nevada, Arizona, California and Utah.

It follows the shootout early on Thursday at the junction of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, near several world famous casino resort hotels, including Bellagio and Caesars Palace.

Cherry had been driving a Maserati sports car when he was shot, and the vehicle then collided with a taxi, causing it to explode.

The driver, Michael Bolden, 62, and his passenger, identified in local media reports as Sandi Sutton, from Washington state, were killed in the explosion.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said Harris is wanted for the murder of all three, and that officers were 'utilising every available resource' to find him.

He warned yesterday that any members of the public 'harbouring' Harris or helping him to evade the authorities could face charges themselves.

Lt Steiber said that although there were other men were in the Range Rover at the time, Harris is believed to be the only shooter.

He added: 'At this point Ammar Harris is the one responsible for the shooting and the murder of three individuals.'

No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police have confirmed, and Cherry, an aspiring rapper, did not return fire.

Lt Steiber added: 'Right now, as far as we're concerned, Mr Cherry, he's the victim of a murder and that's what we're focused on.'

Harris, who lived in South Carolina and Georgia, was convicted of marijuana possession in 2005 in Atlanta.

In December, he was arrested in Miami for reckless driving and failure to produce a valid license.

He also used the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris when he was arrested last May in Las Vegas and charged with sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a weapon.

His apparently brand new Range Rover has been impounded, but police have declined to say where it was found. Steiber said no guns were found inside.

Authorities say the shooting may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip.

It took place less than a mile from where rapper Tupac Shakur was shot in September 1996.

The 25-year-old had been riding in a BMW with Death Row Records co-founder Marion 'Suge' Knight after the two men had attended a Mike Tyson boxing match.
