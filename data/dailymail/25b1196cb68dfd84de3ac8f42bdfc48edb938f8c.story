Ireland's former prime minister Albert Reynolds has died at the age of 81.

He served as taoiseach for just under three years, from February 1992 to January 1993 and again from January 1993 to December 1994.

Representing the Fianna Fáil party, he played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process and is best known as one of the architects of the historic Downing Street Declaration of 1993.

Reynolds retired from politics in 2002 and developed Alzheimer's disease in later life.

Ireland's former prime minister Albert Reynolds, who served as taoiseach in the 1990s, has died aged 81

He was born in 1932 and grew up in the small village of Roosky in Co Roscommon.

He later abandoned a sensible job and set up a dance hall empire with his brother Jim to capitalise on the big craze of the 1950s and 60s.

After turning to politics, he was first elected to Dail Eireann for the Longford/Westmeath constituency in 1977 for Fianna Fail and was appointed a government minister just two years later.

He was elected Ireland's eighth taoiseach in 1992 and worked with then-prime minister John Major, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and then-SDLP leader John Hume to try to deliver stability to the north.

The Downing Street Declaration, which Mr Reynolds co-signed with Mr Major on December 15, 1993, paved the way for an IRA ceasefire in 1994, which in turn led loyalist paramilitaries to declare an end to terrorism, and laid the foundations for the eventual signing of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

Mr Adams recently claimed that Mr Reynolds brought a new dynamic to peace negotiations and praised his 'directness' in addressing the potential for progress.

One of Mr Reynolds's most famous achievements was  the Downing Street Declaration, which he signed with then-British Prime Minister John Major in 1993, paving the way for the Northern Ireland peace process

Mr Adams said: 'His wife Kathleen and their family welcomed me into their home and we enjoyed copious cups of tea during the ups and downs of that time.

'His was a relatively short term as taoiseach but Mr Reynolds ended exclusions, formal censorship and brought the Irish government in from the cold.'

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams expressed his condolences to the Reynolds family today, saying: 'I'm really sorry to hear of the death of Albert Reynolds.

'Albert acted on the North (of Ireland) when it mattered. My thoughts are with (his wife) Kathleen and all the Reynolds family. May he rest in peace.'

Mr Reynolds resigned as leader of the party and as taoiseach in late 1994 following a dispute with Fianna Fail's then coalition partner, Labour.

In 1997, he suffered another political defeat in an internal Fianna Fail election to determine the party's presidential candidate.

He was beaten by Belfast-born academic Mary McAleese, who went on to win the presidency and served as head of state for two terms.

Mr Reynolds later retired from politics in 2002.

Husband to Kathleen and father to seven children, the once busy businessman-turned-politician had since been enjoying his retirement.

But his health became poor and in 2008 and, in December 2013, ill-health kept him away from the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street Declaration.

That week, his son Philip revealed that Mr Reynolds was in the very last stages of Alzheimer's disease and in need of 24-hour care. At the end, he was unable to have conversations with people.
