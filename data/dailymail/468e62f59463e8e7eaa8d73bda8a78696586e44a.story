Victim: Joe Smith, 24, died after being involved in a lift accident while on holiday in Barcelona

A British man has died after being involved in a lift accident while on holiday in Barcelona.

Pub manager Joe Smith, 24, of Leicester, died following an accident in a lift on Tuesday, it was revealed today.

It was unclear how the accident happened or exactly where in the Spanish city it occurred.

He was reportedly on holiday with his girlfriend at the time of the incident.

His friends took to social media to launch an appeal to raise money to bring his body home - and hit their target just 15 hours later.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed they had been made aware of the incident.

Paul
Talbot, described on Twitter as a tattoo artist, posted a message that 
said: 'Im trying to help raise money for Joe Smith, who was tragically 
killed in Barcelona while on holiday, and without any travel insurance.

'Its going to cost 4000 just to get him home.'

Close friend Matt Barratt-Jones, 37, raised the money by orchestrating a tattoo competition, while others have sold personal items in order to drum up cash.

Tattooist Matt, of Leicester, said: 'People's response has been amazing, I was hoping for support but so far the reaction has been overwhelming.

'It's going to cost at least Â£4,000 to get him home let alone the funeral costs so the least we could do to help raise money was to give away full day tattoo sessions.'

One donator said: 'Joey was loved by 
so many people, he was the most kind hearted, caring and genuine person 
we have ever met. He should be very proud of the man he was.'

Another friend is also to cycle 60 miles in bid to raise funds, while a third is to run a half marathon in Nottingham in Joe's memory.

Mr Smith had previously worked at The Lansdowne pub in Leicester city centre before moving to The Orange Tree, where he was reportedly recently promoted.

One of his former colleagues, Neil Douglas, paid tribute to him today.

He told ITV News: 'He was a really fun loving guy, he had so many friends. He got on with everyone, he was like the life of the party.'

A member of staff at the pub told MailOnline today: 'We all miss him deeply and he was loved by everyone who knew.'

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Barcelona on the 3rd of September.

'We are in contact with the family and are providing consular assistance.'

Leicestershire
Police said that they have not been made aware of the incident but that
they will be liaising with their Spanish counterparts over the coming 
days.
