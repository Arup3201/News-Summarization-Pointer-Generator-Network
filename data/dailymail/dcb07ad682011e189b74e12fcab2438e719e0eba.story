In trouble: Darius Ashard got abusive when he was ejected from Caesar's Bar in Great Yarmouth after staff allegedly saw him smoking cannabis

A dwarf who played Snoozy the dwarf in a pantomime starring Priscilla Presley hurled abuse at police after he was thrown out of a nightclub for taking drugs, a court heard.

Darius Ashard, 22, was slung over a bouncer's shoulder and ejected from Caesar's Bar in Great Yarmouth after staff allegedly saw him smoking a joint.

The 4ft 6in actor repeatedly called officers 'c****' after they were called to deal with the incident in Norfolk last month.

Prosecutor Fergus Harold said Ashard also told a sergeant that he was a man 'who can't keep his missus happy'.

Mr Harold added: 'He on many times calls them the C-word. I could go along on similar lines but it gets quite repetitive.'

Ashard of Great Yarmouth admitted disorderly behaviour and was fined £40 with £45 costs, which will be deducted from his Jobseeker's Allowance benefits.

He claimed he had only acted up because he thought he had been treated unfairly as he had not been smoking cannabis in the club.

Ashard, representing himself in court, apologised for swearing, saying: 'That does sound pretty bad and the language used was inappropriate.'

He added: 'I was ejected but it was under the suspicion of smoking cannabis and I wasn't.

'Security manhandled me, picked me up over his shoulder and threw me down. I didn't feel that I got fairly treated.

'I said I would like to make a complaint about the door staff but the sergeant said there was nothing I could do about that.'

Ashard played dwarf Snoozy in a panto production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs alongside Priscilla Presley, 67, as the wicked queen in a two month run last Christmas at the New Wimbledon theatre, south London.

Fellow dwarf Warwick Davies also starred in the show.

Incident: The dwarf was slung over a bouncer's shoulder and dumped in the street outside this Great Yarmouth club and amusements

Ashard  was given a 12 month community order and 40 hours unpaid work at Snaresbrook Crown Court in January after he admitted aggravated vehicle taking and handling stolen goods.

The court heard how he had been a terrified passenger in a Vauxhall Astra which was taken in a burglary and screamed, 'I'm going to die' during a high speed police chase in August last year.

He was arrested soon after the car was stopped and was caught with a stolen laptop and an iPad from a house in Woodford Green, Essex.

Ashard claimed his friends had asked him to look after the bag of stolen property and had been desperate to get out of the car.
