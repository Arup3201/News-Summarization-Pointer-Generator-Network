Pirate copies of South Korean and Chinese television programmes are widely available and traded on the black market, The Telegraph reports.

Details on the executions were provided by the intelligence service in a report to the South Korean parliament on Tuesday, Yonhap News told the paper.

Last week, South Korean media reported that six officials - including the minister of mail and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months.

An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'.

If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011.

This comes a day after North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years.

UN human rights chief Marzuki Darusman said he was surprised and gratified that North Korean officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting.

But he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader Kim Jong Un was insisting that he drop moves in a UN resolution to prosecute the country at the International Criminal Court.over its human rights record.

A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, published in February, detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.
