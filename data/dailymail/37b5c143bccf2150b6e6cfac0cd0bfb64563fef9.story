Denial: Boris Johnson says he is definitely not going to return to Parliament

Boris Johnson today attempted to play down rumours sweeping through Westminster that he will take a safe Commons seat and mount an immediate leadership challenge if David Cameron fails to secure an overall majority at the next election.

The Mayor of London dismissed the plot as 'complete cloud cuckoo land' but did not rule out a return to Parliament when he leaves City Hall in 2016.

Mr Johnson was forced to respond today after Tory Zac Goldsmith offered his west London seat to him if the Government forces through plans for a third runway at Heathrow.

He said he will 'absolutely not' be returning to Parliament while he is Mayor.

It has today been confirmed he has met with Zac Goldsmith to discuss the airport issue, but a source said they 'jokingly' discussed the by-election but 'dismissed it out of hand.'

'This is all complete cloud cuckoo land,' the Mayor told London's LBC radio.

'Of course I’ve had conversations with Zac and with other MPs in London and elsewhere about how to solve the aviation problem. I’m absolutely not going to be returning to Parliament, I’ve got to do a job here in London and that’s what I want to do and it’s a massive, engrossing job.'

Later he told the BBC about his plans for post-2016: 'I really think I’ll be over the hill, I’ll be clapped out.'

Allies of the London Mayor, whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the Olympics and Paralympics, played down the prospect of him making a Westminster comeback before that.

Their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the Prime Minister to install Mr Johnson.

One Conservative MP, Colonel Bob Stewart, said two colleagues approached him before the summer break to consider a ‘stalking horse’ challenge for the party leadership that might open the door for Mr Johnson to take over. But Colonel Stewart told them to ‘get lost’.

The Mayor infuriated Number Ten by going to war with Mr Cameron last week, criticising what he called a ‘fudgearama’ over increasing airport capacity.

But a spokesman for Mr Johnson dismissed as ‘fanciful’ a claim that multi- millionaire Tory rebel Zac Goldsmith, who has threatened to quit Parliament if the Government goes ahead with a third runway at Heathrow, offered his south-west London seat to the Mayor.

However, despite the denials from City Hall, the rumours about Mr Johnson's return to Westminster do not seem to be going away.

The two men were said to have discussed 
the prospect of a by-election in Mr Goldsmith’s Richmond constituency 
following last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron sidelined 
ministers who are opposed to Heathrow expansion.

Mr Johnson did meet Mr Goldsmith and the 
by-election scheme is thought to have been ‘jokingly’ mentioned, but the
Mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand.

Mr Goldsmith wrote yesterday on 
Twitter: ‘I have never offered to resign! But I did promise before the 
election that I would, if the Government U-turns on Heathrow.’

But MPs who want to see Mr Johnson in 
Downing Street confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken 
place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election.

Mr Goldsmith’s seat is not considered 
safe enough because it is a marginal. Two that have been discussed by Mr
Johnson’s supporters are Mole Valley, where veteran MP Sir Paul 
Beresford might be persuaded to step down, and Henley, the Mayor’s old 
Commons seat.

Mr Johnson has always insisted he has 
no intention of trying to oust Mr Cameron and has pledged to see out his
second term as Mayor.

But while he would be heavily 
criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and MP for an 
extended period, he is due to leave office in London in 2016.

That would mean the two jobs would 
only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general 
election. One rebel MP said: ‘The aim is that Boris is in place at the 
next election. If Cameron loses the election badly, he’ll resign and 
Boris will stand, but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch 
up another coalition with the Lib Dems then there will be blood on the 
walls. We won’t let him do it again.’

Another rebel Tory, Nadine Dorries, said: ‘We need to get Boris in and Cameron out to survive 2015.’

But Mr Johnson said he was ‘absolutely
not’ planning a return to the Commons. ‘As I said in the election about
a billion times, being Mayor is the best job in British politics and 
it’s what I want to do,’ he said.

After his election defeat in May, Ken Livingstone was tipped to disappear from the political world once and for all.

But today he reappeared and managed to have a dig at his old foe Boris Johnson over London 2012, accusing him of having 'milked it for everything he can get out of it.'

Wearing the same jacket he wore when London won the Games in 2005 when he was mayor, Mr Livingstone denied he was jealous of Mr Johnson's soaring popularity because of the Olympics.

It came the night after the pair met by coincidence at the Paralympics closing ceremony, where they had a quick bicker and then Boris playfully rubbed the top of his head much to the delight of Labour leader Ed Miliband who was watching on.

Speaking as Britain's sportsmen and women marched through the streets of London today, Red Ken took the chance to lay into Mr Johnson and also dismissed his chances of taking over at No.10.

'[Boris Johnson] has milked it for everything he can get out of it. I
look at what we’ve achieved and the difference it’s made in the East 
End. All I say to Boris is, you’ve had your fun now what are you going 
to build that the next Mayor will open 10 or 12 years down the road?'

'I simply say, when I chat to Boris, don’t worry about being Prime 
Minister, you can do things as big as this that will put London on the 
international map again solidly in 2020.'

He also dismissed Boris's plans for a Boris Island airport in the Thames estuary, saying 'it is never going to happen'.
