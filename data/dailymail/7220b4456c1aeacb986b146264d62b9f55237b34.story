With a name like Double Take and a song called Hot Problems, you might already have guessed they think highly of themselves.

But two wannabe pop princesses could well find themselves propelled into a storm of Samantha Brick proportions after releasing a music video bemoaning all the downsides of being beautiful.

In it, the teenagers, aka Drew and Lauren, gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks.

'We're hot!': Pop duo Double Take in their music video Hot Problems in which they lament the negatives of being pretty

Controversial: The girls giggle and gesture flirtatiously at the camera. The song has attracted more than 60,000 'dislikes' on YouTube in just five days

Lamenting (out of tune) over a rather dodgy 
electro-pop backing track, they proclaim: 'Hot girls we have problems, 
too. We're just like you, except we're hot.'

Other lines include: 'Please don't get me wrong. I know I'm hot, but textbook perfection really takes a lot.

'Weird guys calls my phone and girls call names... but I can't be tamed.'

The song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as Mrs Brick did when she claimed in a Daily Mail article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive.

She said: 'There are downsides to being pretty â€” the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks.'

Her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on MailOnline, rising to 2.7million when you include her follow-up article defending her stance.

In a similar brewing storm, the 'Hot Problems' video has been watched more than a million times on YouTube, but has received more than 60,000 'dislikes' compared to just 4,800 'likes'.

One poster pleaded: 'Please shoot my ears off.'

As if anticipating the resultant backlash, the production company, Old Bailey Productions, made sure to distance itself from the video.

'Old Bailey Productions did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video,' it stated in the description. 'We produced the video as a favor.'

From an 'artistic' point of view, many are also making derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's widely slated flop Friday which was dubbed possibly the 'worst video of all time' last year.

It is not entirely clear whether the high school pair, who have not revealed their surnames, are merely being tongue in cheek, but they have said they created the video 'just for fun'.

'It was just have something we could share with our friends,' Drew said in an interview with MTV.com.

'We enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one. I think that hopefully there could be a future with it.'

Lauren added: 'I don't think we're going to be the next Adele, but we do really like writing songs and coming up with lyrics. Who knows? Maybe we'll get into that.'
