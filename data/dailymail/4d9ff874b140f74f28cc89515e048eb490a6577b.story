Gareth Bale has told his critics at Real Madrid he does not care what they say, and reaffirmed his confidence in his own abilities.

Less than a week ago Bale found his white Bentley under attack from irate Real fans after the Clasico defeat to Barcelona in which influential newspaper Marca scored him zero mark.

He has been subjected to boos from the stands and had his £86million pricetag mocked and questioned.

But in Wales’ hugely important Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel Bale was magnificent, scoring twice to move onto 16 in total for his country and beyond the great John Charles in the all-time list.

And Bale said: ‘I don’t need to answer the critics. I know, and everyone around me knows, what I can do.

‘There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that.

‘I don’t feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football.

‘I love playing for Wales, it’s a big honour and the most important thing is I focus on my football. I don’t listen to anyone else, what they’re saying, just enjoying my football with the boys.’

He was a picture of happiness at full-time, emitting a roar of joy when the final whistle sounded in the Sammy Ofer Stadium to confirm a 3-0 win.

A brace from Bale added to Aaron Ramsey’s opener sent Wales top of Group B on 11 points at the halfway stage.

Bale should collect his 50th cap for his nation in June’s qualifier against Belgium, where victory would put Wales on the precipice of reaching a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.

Bale has now scored 20 goals for club and country this season, including a brilliant free-kick in Israel, similar to his late winner in Andorra at the start of qualifying.

His Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has not score direct from a set piece in more than 50 attempts dating back to last April.

Bale sits joint-sixth, alongside Mark Hughes, Robert Earnshaw and Cliff Jones in the all-time Welsh scoring charts. Ian Rush leads the way with 28.
