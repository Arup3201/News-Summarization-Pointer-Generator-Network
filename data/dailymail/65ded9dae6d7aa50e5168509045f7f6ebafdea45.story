Stan Wawrinka opened the defence of his Australian Open title in style, losing just seven games in his first-round match on Tuesday.

The Swiss took one hour and 29 minutes to see off Turkish world No 100 Marsel Ilhan 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena, the scene of his maiden Grand Slam triumph against Rafael Nafal last year.

Players have spoken in the past of the pressure of walking on court as a defending Grand Slam champion for the first time but there was no sign of any nerves for Wawrinka.

The world No 4 came racing out of the blocks and needed just 20 minutes to wrap up the first set against a player who has never progressed past the second round of a Grand Slam.

Ilhan settled in the second set but failed to take any of two break points and Wawrinka only needed one to take a two-set lead.

Wawrinka's strong serving - his first-serve percentage ended at 82% - and he broke twice in the third set before clinching victory with an unreturnable serve.

The 29-year-old said: 'The first Grand Slam is never easy but I am happy with the way I played today.

'I was happy to be back on the court. I can feel that I have a lot of support here and it's always nice to come back like that and to feel the crowd behind you.

'For sure it's great but it's still the beginning of the tournament. It's just one match, now I need to be ready for the next one.'

Wawrinka is on a good run of form after ending his year with a first Davis Cup title for Switzerland and then starting 2015 by winning the Aircel Chennai Open a fortnight ago.

He now goes on to face Spaniard Pablo Andujar or Romanian Marius Copil in the second round on Thursday.
