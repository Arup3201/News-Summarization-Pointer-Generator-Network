Up to 42.5 million people across the United States are expected to hit the road today to visit family and 
friends for Thanksgiving - the highest number of holiday travellers since the start of 
the recession.

But Thanksgiving travellers are also 
at the mercy of the weather. Forecasters warned of rain and scattered 
thunderstorms in much of the north east, with a mixture of snow and 
freezing rain expected in upstate New York and northern New England.

Mountainous areas could see four to eight inches of snow. Two forecasted storms are expected to cause havoc.

Worse than usual: Los Angeles is predicting even higher volumes of traffic as usual as Americans hit the roads to spend the holiday with family memebers

The first storm, which has already caused
 flash flooding across Arkansas, is forecast to move into the Southeast,
 bringing severe weather on Wednesday.

It will also bring rain showers and 
snow showers to the North east, with two inches of rain expected in 
Boston and New York and more than a foot of snow through New York, 
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

The worst of the severe weather was 
forecast to develop across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, 
Georgia, Tennessee, even into the North and South Carolinas.

The second storm moved into the North west on Tuesday evening and continuing through Thanksgiving day, bringing with it up to five inches of rain and a foot of snow to higher elevations.

Flooding and strong winds are expected to be a major concern.

Travel tracker AAA says that four per cent more Americans than last year will journey at least 50 miles from home, with about 90 percent of them driving.

Another 8 percent plan to fly, but AAA notes that higher airfares and less available seats have forced many would-be fliers to drive instead.

The remaining travelers plan to take buses, trains or other forms of transport.

This is the third consecutive Thanksgiving that Americans have taken to the road in higher numbers than in the past year, the Associated Press reports.

Travelling again, finally: More people will travel this year since the recession began, analysts predict

The increase in holiday travel is welcome news for an industry that has been struggling to get Americans back on the road.

Memorial Day saw no increase in vacations and travel was down for both July 4th and Labor Day breaks.

AAA says that Americans are willing to spend now because they want to spend time with their family.

'As consumers weigh the fear of 
economic uncertainty and the desire to create lasting family memories 
this holiday, more Americans are expected to choose family and friends 
over frugality,' Bill Sutherland, vice president of AAA Travel Services, 
said.

The prices are up and weather is not offering any comfort for travellers.

Thanksgiving airfares are up 20 per cent this year, and the average price of a gallon of gas has risen almost 20 per cent, according to travel tracker AAA. Rail travelers were also affected, with fares on most one-way Amtrak tickets up 2 to 5 per cent.

Two forecasted storms are expected to make air travel rough across parts of the country, causing delays and cancellations at airports.Â 

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, five of country's busiest airports were already reporting delays of 15-45 minutes due to weather conditions on Tuesday.

On the roads, Weather.com says that on Wednesday there will be headaches inNortheast, New England (rain, wind, wet northern New England snow), Pacific Northwest, N. Calif. (rain, mountain snow)Potential problems: Southeast coast to Florida (t-storms mainly during first half of the day.)

On Thursday there will headaches at the Pacific Northwest (rain, wind, mountain snow.)There will be potential problems in California, S. Arizona and New Mexico (showers) and on Friday there will be no headaches but potential problems in Iowa to Texas (rain, t-storms late),Northern/Central Rockies (snow) and the Southwest (showers).

Amtrak has yet to report problems but advises travellers to check for alerts on amtrak.com.

Those 
driving should expect to pay more at the pump. The average price of a 
gallon of gas so far this November is $3.42, up nearly 20 per cent from 
last year's $2.86, according to AAA, Wright Express and Oil Price 
Information Service. That means for every 100 miles a family drives this
 holiday they should expect to spend about $2.50 more on gas.

Rates
 for mid-range hotels are expected to increase 6 percent from last year 
ago with travelers spending an average of $145 a night. Lower-priced 
motels are seeing a seven per cent increase to $103.

Weekend daily car rental rates will average $37, an 11 per cent drop from last year.

AAA said Thanksgiving airfares are 20 per cent higher than last year with an average lowest round-trip rate of $212 for the top 40 U.S. air routes.

That estimate is much higher than a four per cent increase predicted by both Orbitz and Priceline.

Those companies said the average airfare was closer to $400. Airlines report quarterly airfares but don't break out prices for specific holidays.

The findings are based on a survey of 1,357 people in the U.S., 543 who said they plan to travel.

On this the fourth Thanksgiving since the economy sank, prices for everything from airline flights to groceries are going up, and some Americans are scaling back.

Yet in many households, the occasion is too important to skimp on. Said one mother: 'I don't have much to give, but I'll be cooking, and the door will be open.'

Bill Sutherland, vice president of AAA Travel Services, said: 'This is the first significant increase in any holiday travel this year.

Families who had foregone travel over the last three years are likely to reverse their decisions this year, the group said, leading to the uptick in the forecast.

The forecast, based on a monthly survey of 50,000 homes, said some 3.4 million - up 1.8 percent year-on-year - would fly over the Thanksgiving weekend

Thanksgiving travel took a big hit in 2008 following the financial crisis and the economic uncertainty it caused.

A 16lbs turkey and all the trimmings will cost an average of $49.20 - a 13 per cent jump from last year, or about $5.73 more, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
