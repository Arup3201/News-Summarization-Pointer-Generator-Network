Monaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev insists the spotlight is firmly on Arsenal when the two sides meet in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

The Ligue 1 outfit travel to north London as underdogs for the last 16 first leg encounter - despite topping Group C in the first phase of the competition.

Monaco have bounced back from a wretched start to the season, and the summer departures of Colombian duo James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao, by losing only one of their last 10 matches in all competitions.

The French outfit have already experienced winning at the home of Arsenal too following their 1-0 pre-season win in the Emirates Cup last summer.

Allied  to the fact that Arsenal have failed to progress beyond the Champions League last 16 in the past four seasons and Vasilyev is adamant that his side have nothing to lose over the two legs.

'There is a lot of history between these two clubs,' the Stade Louis II chief told L'Equipe. 'We both had [Arsene] Wenger coach us, [Thierry] Henry played for both of us.

'We enjoyed a good result at the Emirates last summer, too, when we won 1-0. Now, in a competitive game, we have nothing to lose.

'We want to show that we have young players and that our team has no fear. They're capable of rising to a high level – the project here isn't dead as people claimed earlier this season.

'The pressure is on Arsenal, who have been unable to get past the last 16 in recent seasons.'
