A woman has been ordered to pay £27,000 in court costs after keeping more than 60 animals in 'appalling' conditions at her home.

Diana Curtis, 55, kept 33 horses and 34 dogs in a 'disgusting' state at her farm in Great Torrington, Devon.

Officials from the RSPCA found the premises to be covered in faeces and littered with hazards, Barnstaple Magistrates Court heard.

Cruel: More than 34 dogs were kept in a 'digusting' state in Diana Curtis's home in Devon

Court costs: The 55-year-old has been ordered to pay £27,000 court costs and carry out a 12-month community order

No grazing: The court heard the animals had been forced to eat stinging nettles

Ban: Curtis has been disqualified from keeping horses for 12 months

It also heard there was no outside grazing available and virtually no food and animals had to eat part of a stinging nettle bush.

Prosecutor Iain O'Donnell said: 'Thirty-four dogs were removed from the premises. Photographs show the disgusting conditions in which they were living.'

Curtis admitted three counts of animal cruelty and was ordered to pay court costs of £27,361.99 and a £60 victim surcharge. The court costs were so high because of the length of the time it took to bring the prosecution against her.

She was also sentenced to a 12-month community order with 240 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from keeping horses for 12 months.

Rachael Sewell, defending, said: 'She was desperately trying to find homes for the dogs but was struggling. She was completely overwhelmed by the situation.'
