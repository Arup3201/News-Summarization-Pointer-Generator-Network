A Florida teenager is now safely home after a running away with an older man on Tuesday, and her relieved parents have the kind folks at Chick-fil-a to thank.

Steve and Tammy Harp of Jacksonville were horrified to find a note from their 16-year-old daughter Kaitlyn in which she told them she'd left with a 19-year-old man she'd met online just months before.

Some digging revealed an Instagram photo of Kaitlyn with the man wearing a Chick-fil-a shirt and managers from the beloved southern chicken restaurant soon got involved and in just 24 they'd found the teen and had her heading home.

Runaway: 16-year-old Kaitlyn Harp, left, ran away with Daniel Bridgeman, 19, on Tuesday and this Instagram photo of in which Bridgeman is wearing a Chick-fil-a uniform quickly helped her parents find her

It was a striking example of the power of social media and also the profound empathy even strangers can have for fellow parents in need.

'Because of their involvement what could have taken days, weeks, or months, only took a matter of two or three hours once they got involve,' an emotional Steve Harp told FCN. 'It is beyond words, as a parent, this is your worst nightmare.'

The story began seven months prior when Kaitlyn met 19-year-old Daniel Bridgeman online.

The Harps found the note she left on Tuesday and after seeing the photo of their daughter with Bridgeman they rushed to the Jacksonville International Airport Chick-fil-a location in hopes of finding him.

Quick thinking: Yulee, Florida Chick-fil-a worker Lita Fannin (left) posted the photo on a site for operators of the southern chicken chain and within two hours Bridgeman was identified

The folks at the Chick-fil-a didn't know the man, but they put the Harps in touch with another store manager named Lita Fannin, who asked for pictures of Bridgeman and Kaitlyn.

Thanks to Fannin, the photos were then seen by hundreds of Florida Chick-fil-a operators on a Facebook group page and just two hours after she'd posted them, a manager in Winter Haven, Florida recognized Bridgeman.

Which is when this tale of the generosity of CHick-fil-a managers gets even more touching.

The Winter Haven manager Elio Florin reached out to Bridgeman and got Kaitlyn to call home. That night, Florin personally drove Kaitlyn the three hours from Winter Haven back to Jacksonville.

Three hours away: The Harps began their search at a Jacksonville Chick-fil-a (pictured), and word quickly spread statewide. It turns out, Bridgeman worked at a location in Winter Haven, some 200 miles from Jacksonville

Thanks to Fannin and Florin, Kaitlyn was home by 1:30am Wednesday.

'We can't thank them enough,' said Tammy Harp. 'They could have just wiped it away, "aw no big deal," but she put it upon herself, being a mother, said "I have to get involved."'

And while the Harps are calling her and Florin heroes, Fannin maintains she just did what any parent would.

'I have kids around that age, and I would hope if that happened to me, someone would act quickly,' said Fannin. 'It turned out really positive, really quickly, which is a blessing.'

Bridgeman faces no charges, but Florin made sure to give the teen a stern lecture when he arrived to pick up Kaitlyn.
