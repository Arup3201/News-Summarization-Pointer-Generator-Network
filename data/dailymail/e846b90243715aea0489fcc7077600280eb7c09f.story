Barcelona signing Luis Suarez is further proof the Catalan giants are abandoning their free-flowing football principles, according to club legend Johan Cruyff.

The Catalan giants agreed a deal said to be worth in the region of £75million for the Liverpool striker at the end of last week in order to bolster their attacking options.

Major doubts: Johan Cruyff does not know if Suarez will prove to be a good fit at Barcelona

However Cruyff believes Barcelona may have to change their style of play if Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar are going to form a successful attacking partnership. 

‘I am happy that Germany won the World Cup. They are playing the kind of football that Barcelona are distancing themselves from,’ said Cruyff.

‘That feeling has only gotten stronger with the signing of Luis Suarez. He is a great player, but has a complicated character.

‘I don't know how they plan to play free-flowing attacking football with Messi, Neymar and Suarez in one team. They are all players who rely on their individual actions.

‘Barcelona choose for individualism rather than a team playing good football. The style of play they developed under Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola is being abandoned.’
