With its cascading vertical gardens and seemingly levitating levels, Sydney's mesmerising skyscraper titled One Central Park, has been declared the Best Tall Building Worldwide.

The new building took out the top gong awarded by Chicago organisation, the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), this year after being picked out from amongst 88 other entries and being recognised as the clear winner in the Asia-Australia region category. 

Antony Wood, CTBUH's executive director said the entry 'stopped me dead'.

Sydney's One Central Park Building has been recognised as the Best Tall Building Worldwide

It features a 1,120 square metre cascading vertical garden that is made up of over 35,000 plants

'There have been major advances in the incorporation of greenery in high-rise buildings over the past few years – but nothing on the scale of this building has been attempted or achieved,' Mr Wood said.

'One Central Park strongly points the way forward, not only for an essential naturalization of our built environment, but for a new aesthetic for our cities – an aesthetic entirely appropriate to the environmental challenges of our age.'

Designed by Nobel Prize winner Jean Nouvel, the 38-floor glass building which hosts shops and apartments, features 1,120 square metres of vertical garden.

This is made up of over 35,000 plants of over 250 Australian native species.

Other winners from around the world included the De Rotterdam building in the Netherlands, which one the best tall building award in the European category

They are watered through a drip-irrigation system and are able to grow without soil due to being attached to a water-soaked felt and mesh base, according to The Guardian.

The building's sustainable features, which include its own water recycling plant, a tri-generation power plant and a cantilevered heliostat, left the judges in awe.

'This project was about the visibility of sustainable design,' Jean Nouvel said.

'If we do all these sustainable things and no one can see them, do they really exist? The choices we make for a sustainable future cannot be made in the future.They must be made today.' 

Other winners from around the world included the De Rotterdam building in the Netherlands for the European category and the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt federal building in Portland for the Americas.
