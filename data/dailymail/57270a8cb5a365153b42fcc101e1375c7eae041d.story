Singer Christine Anu is working on a brand new music track - and using the rhythm of Australian's heartbeat for the one-of-a-kind production.

In an Australian first, the 43-year-old My Island Home singer has partnered up with Heart Research Australia (HROz) and Metamucil to create the new song, and remind people of the importance of maintaining low cholesterol levels in the process.

By placing a single index finger against the specially designed heartbeat pod, the device is able to listen to the user’s heartbeat before translating it into a unique music track.

Christine said she has always been conscious about her cholesterol levels.

'As an Indigenous Australian, I have had to monitor my cholesterol my whole life as I fall into a high risk category,' she said.

'The heartbeat pod initiative is a great way to get Australians to listen to their hearts, and serve as a reminder at the importance of maintaining healthy cholesterol levels.

'I can’t wait to hear the different heartbeats of Australia and use them to release a music track with all proceeds being donated to Heart Research Australia.'

HROz recently approved psyllium husk fibre supplement Metamucil to help lower cholesterol when consumed as directed on the label, in conjunction with a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol.

Chief executive officer Floyd Larsen said: 'What people don’t realise is that cholesterol levels may be lowered with a healthy nutritious diet low in saturated fat and high in fibre.'

The pop singer gained popularity with the release of her song My Island Home in 1995 and has won several ARIA Music Awards.
