The highest paid female business executive in the United States was born a man.

Martine Rothblatt, who earns $38 million-a-year as head of United Therapeutics, was a married father-of-four before undergoing a sex change in 1994.

Born into a Jewish family in San Diego, Martin trained as a lawyer at UCLA, married, had children, and went into business.

Twenty years later, she has been named top in New York Magazine's list of the 200 most successful entrepreneurs - one of just 11 women in the list.

Success: Martine Rothblatt, 60, started life as a man and had four children before a gender reassignment

She rocketed to success as a man in 1990, investing in the $19 billion digital radio industry years before any other company.

After a gender reassignment, Rothblatt embarked on the second chapter of her career, developing revolutionary drugs as an alternative for heart and lung transplants.

Last year, the firm posted a revenue of $1.1 billion, making her the most successful businesswoman in the world's most powerful nation.

Rothblatt, who is still married to her wife of 32 years Bina, concedes that her achievement is unusual. 

'I can’t claim that what I have achieved is equivalent to what a woman has achieved,' she told the magazine.

'For the first half of my life, I was male.'

However, she is pioneering an alternative approach to gender roles in society.  

She denounces the use of 'Ms' for women and 'Mr' for men. Instead, she says, we should use 'Pn' for person.

Unique: Rothblatt welcomes the prefix 'trans' because it highlights her personal journey of discovery

Her children still know her as 'dad', while her grandchildren have adopted the nickname 'Grand Martine' instead of grandmother.

And in a manifesto entitled Apartheid Of Sex published in 1995, a year after her sex change, Rothblatt proclaimed: 'Genitals are as irrelevant to one’s role in society as skin tone'.

But 'trans' is a prefix she wears with pride because she feels it highlights her journey of self-discovery.

She founded United Therapeutics pharmaceutical company after their child was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension - a life-threatening condition that restricts blood flow to the lungs.

The drug Orenitram started publicly trading in 1999 at $12.

Last year, after two failed attempts, Rothblatt got approval for the drug in pill form from the Food and Drug Administration.

The stock instantly doubled.

In June, it had a market capitalisation of $4.6 billion.

Now, she and Bina lead a new 'trans' religion called Terasem, which sees the body as a shell for the mind - as they develop digital clones through which we can 'live after death'.
