Suicide is suspected in the death of an experienced skydiver who died in a jump in southern California yesterday.

The victim of the Wednesday morning sky dive has been identified as 53-year-old divorce Thomas Steve Clark of Jamul, who had logged more than 10,000 jumps in his three decades of skydiving.

Clark was jumping with Sky Dive San Diego around 10:30am when his parachute failed to deploy and he fell to his death near the 13531 block of Otay Lakes Road in Jamul.

Deadly fall: An experienced skydiver died Wednesday morning when his parachute failed to deploy on a jump near San Diego, California. The victim has been identified as Thomas Steve Clark, 53, of Jamul

Sky Dive San Diego owner Buzz Fink says Clark was experienced and was jumping with brand new equipment that should have deployed his parachute automatically if he wasn't able to pull the chord. Fink says all sky divers are required to wear the equipment on jumps with his company.

That leads Fink to believe that Clark knowingly turned the device off and jumped to his death on purpose.

'We later discovered that the gentleman has evidently been depressed and from descriptions of events we believe it was a suicide,' Fink told City News Service.

Fink says before the jump, those on the plane with Clark didn't notice behavior out of the ordinary.

On purpose: Clark was jumping with Sky Dive San Diego on Wednesday, which is owned by Buzz Fink (pictured). Fink believes Clark committed suicide since the parachute should have deployed automatically. He believes Clark turned that safety equipment off before the jump

'He was  normal as he normally was...not happy, not sad, just kinda in between,' Fink said.

Clark had been sky diving for the past 30 years, and came out to jump with Sky Dive San Diego three to four times a month, Fink said.

During those outings, he would make three to 10 jumps a day and acted as a 'mentor to other jumpers'.

He reportedly worked as a handyman and had months worth of jobs booked at the time of his death.

Clark is survived by a teenage son.
