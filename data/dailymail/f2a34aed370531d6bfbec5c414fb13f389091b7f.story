Dannii Minogue is hardly the celebrity that comes to mind when you think of plus size designs, but the pint sized star, who is only 5ft 2 inches tall and a slim size 8,  has helped create a range for more curvaceous ladies.

The 41-year-old’s fashion label ‘Project D London’ has gone from strength to strength since she launched it with best friend Tabitha Somerset Webb in 2010 having been worn by the Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa.

And now the stylish duo have teamed up with plus size fashion website Simply Be to create an elegant new diffusion range available in sizes 14-32.

Project D London and Simply Be's new collaboration can be viewed on the Simply Be website

The Project D Liberty dress (£90) has flattering sheer sleeves to  cover the tricky upper-arm area, while still being high- glamour

The Project D Carnegie Strappy dress (£90) has a classic clean silhouette and is something you could imagine Danni herself wearing

Dannii became a fashion icon for British women in the Marks & Spencer advertisements (pictured) before launching her own label

Though she has scaled back her media 
career since the birth of her son Ethan and leaving her post as an 
X-factor judge two years ago, fashion continues to be something Ms 
Minogue is passionate about, having become something of a style icon, 
appearing alongside Twiggy and Myleene Klass in those famous M&S 
ads.

Soon she will be sharing some of her hot fashion tips with the rest of us as she has recently bee revealed as one of the judges on the up-coming series of Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model.

Danni and Tabitha have released a behind the scenes video to mark the launch of the collection, and Dannii can be seen helping to style the shoot.

Wearing
 a bright blue chiffon dress and large sunglasses, she seems relaxed and
 in her element- twirling for the camera and embracing a plus size 
model.

Featuring clean
 lines, 'iconic' silhouettes and flattering detailing, the collection 
aims to brings high fashion glamour and elegance to the plus size 
fashion world.

Consisting mainly of going out dresses and tops, empire waists and wrap dresses feature strongly throughout the collection with princes ranging from £60- £150.

The colour palette consists of vibrant jades and aquas, pristine ivories and ethereal floral prints contrasting against the essential summer ‘city-scape’ print cocktail dresses in midnight blue and jet.

Head of Brand at Simply Be, Sarah Bottomley said: ‘Project D London, known for emphasizing and celebrating women’s curves are the perfect fit to offer Simply Be customers a designer injection into their every day style.

‘A first collaboration of its kind, the partnership will see women across the UK have the chance to wear and enjoy Project D London’s signature high-octane glamour no matter what their shape and size.’

Project D London said: ‘We are excited to have developed an inspiring, eminently feminine and fashionable collection of dresses for Simply Be. We have loved every moment of working with a brand renowned for expertly dressing stylish women in such a fantastic range of sizes.’
