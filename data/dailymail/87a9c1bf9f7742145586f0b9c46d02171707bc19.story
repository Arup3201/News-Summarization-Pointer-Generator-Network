Frank Lampard will never be replaced at Chelsea, says his mentor Jose Mourinho.

The Blues' record goalscorer left the club after 13 glittering years this summer, and has since joined title rivals Manchester City on a short-term loan from sister club New York City FC.

Mourinho admits Chelsea's signing of former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas, however, will not fill the hole the England man has left at Stamford Bridge.

New arrival: Cesc Fabregas will revolutionise Chelsea's midfield, but will not replace Lampard

Speaking to Rio Ferdinand for BT Sport, he said: 'Fabregas is the player we need to modify a little bit the profile of our game. We want to give the next dimension to our game in midfield.

'But I think we can never say – in spite of Cesc, who is a fantastic player as you know – that, "This guy is coming to replace Frank," because Frank is Frank and one day he will be alongside Peter Osgood in terms of a statue being built for him, because he’s fantastic.'

Mourinho also admitted Chelsea have a real fight on their hands if they are to reclaim the Premier League title.

The Blues finished third last season - Mourinho's first since returning to Stamford Bridge - behind champions Manchester City and a resurgent Liverpool.

The coming campaign marks 10 seasons since Mourinho's first in England - when his Chelsea side romped to a first league title in 50 years.

But Mourinho believes competition for the top spot if far harder this time around.

'In England it is even stronger now than in my first period,' he said.

'Even more now because when I first came Man City didn’t have this financial situation they have now.

'Even Tottenham at this moment, all the top five or six. In this moment can you tell me who is going to win the Premier League?

'You can’t tell me. You can try to tell me but can you say which one of the top five is going to be outside the Champions League? You can’t say. This is what I want.'

Chelsea's pre-season took them to Turkey on Friday, where they played two 45-minute matches against Besiktas and Fenerbahce, beating the latter 2-0 before a late Ersan Gulum goal handed Besiktas a 1-0 win.
