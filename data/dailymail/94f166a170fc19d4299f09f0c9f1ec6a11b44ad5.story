A baby girl whose father was killed in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan is being denied compensation because her mother cannot prove the child’s paternity.

Private Daniel Wade 20, of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, died with five comrades on March 6, three months before his daughter Lexie-Mai was born.

But the Ministry of Defence is refusing to award a payout to Lexie-Mai’s mother Emma Hickman, 19, because she cannot prove Pte Wade, her fiancé, was the girl’s father.

Now David Cameron has vowed to intervene in what he termed a ‘dreadful situation’.

He pledged to step in after the case was raised by Miss Hickman’s MP David Mowat, a Tory backbencher, in the Commons.

Pte Wade, from Warrington, Cheshire, was killed alongside Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19,  Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all also of 3 Yorks, and Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of  1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment.

The soldiers, who had been in Afghanistan for only a few weeks, died when their armoured vehicle was blown up by a massive improvised explosive device about 25 miles north of the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah.

It was the single biggest loss of life suffered by the Army since the war began in 2001.

Miss Hickman, who also lived in Warrington, was six months’ pregnant with Lexie-Mai – the name the couple had chosen together. Since their daughter was born she has become embroiled in a complicated legal wrangle.

Defence chiefs have refused to award cash because Miss Hickman cannot prove Pte Wade was the baby’s father.

Mr Mowat told the Commons: ‘The Army will not accept paternity without evidence, nor will they release the DNA without a court order. As a consequence, Lexie-Mai received nothing.’

Even if the MoD held a sample of Pte Wade’s DNA, it could not release it unless given permission by his legal representatives.

But Mr Mowat said the Army did not consider Miss Hickman as next-of-kin, and there were difficulties persuading Pte Wade’s legal representatives to allow access to the DNA.

Mr Cameron said he was ‘shocked’ by the case. He added: ‘This is an absolutely dreadful situation and it cannot be allowed to continue.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘There are complicated legal issues affecting this case. We remain in close contact with Miss Hickman and have advised her on how she can take her case forward.’
