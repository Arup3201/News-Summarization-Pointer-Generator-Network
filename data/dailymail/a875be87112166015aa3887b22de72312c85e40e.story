A college freshman died after leaders of his fraternity locked him and 15 others in a room as part of a hazing ritual, allegedly telling them they couldn't leave until all the bottles of alcohol were gone.

More details have emerged about the events surrounding the death of 18-year-old Philip Dhanens, from Fresno, since an investigation was launched after the California State University party turned tragic.

The 18-year-old had only been at college two weeks when he took part in a drinking binge at a off-campus fraternity house on August 31. He was pronounced dead two days later.

Last year's prom king: Dhanens was a 2012 graduate of Garces Memorial High School in Bakersfield where he was a 6-foot, 5-inch, 325-pound defensive tackle for the school's football team

Tragic: Philip Dhanens, pictured with his girlfriend Zoe, has died after an apparent heavy night of drinking during a fraternity pledge event. He had been at university for just two weeks

The coroner said 
Dhanens had swelling of the brain due to acute alcohol consumption and 
his blood-alcohol level was 0.36 at the time of his death.

A court document released on Tuesday 
revealed that members of Theta Chi fraternity have not been cooperating 
fully with the investigation, with detective Michael Gebhart 
saying that fraternity members have declined to 
answer questions and provide requested information.

The search warrant, obtained by the Fresno Bee, said that police are worried that Theta Chi may destroy or 
discard evidence. They were suspended after the incident and were told 
they were not allowed to comment to

The search warrant reveals what happened the night Philip died.

After the fraternity pledges were 
locked in a room and given several bottles of alcohol to drink, including vodka, tequila and whiskey, Theta 
Chi executive board members told 
pledges they were not required to drink.

But, the search warrant said: 'Additional bottles were introduced as
the pledges passed around and finished each bottle. In addition, the pledges were informed they were not allowed to leave 
the Chapter Room to join the other fraternity members in the house 
until they drank all the alcohol.'

Scene: He was drinking at the off-campus Theta Chi fraternity house when someone put him in the 'Sober Up' room - but returned to find him unconscious. He suffered severe brain damage

After about 20 minutes of drinking, 
bonding and encouragement, when 'Dhanens became excited and began drinking 
heavy and aggressively', the warrant states.

Soon after he told members he was not 
feeling well and passed out, when he was carried to the 'drunk room' to 
sober up, during which time, other students  - called the Sober Brothers
- were supposed to be looking after him.

Three hours later he was unconscious and not breathing and 911 was called. But there was nothing that could have saved him.

After his death, the Fresno County Coroner's Office 
reported Dhanens' blood-alcohol level was 0.36, four to five times the 
legal limit to drive.

Dhanens' mother told KFSN-TV she learned her son suffered severe brain damage hours after he attended a party at the fraternity house at the end of August.

Loss: Dhanens was a freshman at Fresno State in California. The fraternity has now been suspended

Dhanens was a 2012 graduate of Garces
Memorial High School in Bakersfield where he was a 6-foot, 5-inch, 
325-pound defensive tackle for the school's football team.

He and his girlfriend Zoe Tucker were prom king and queen in May, according to the school's online newspaper.

'Our
thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Philip at this
incredibly sad time,' university President John Welty said.  'We are heartbroken at the loss of this young man who had just joined our university community and had a life of promise ahead.'

Dhanens'
death comes nearly seven years after a former Fresno State student was 
found dead in a room at Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also the victim of 
alcohol poisoning.
