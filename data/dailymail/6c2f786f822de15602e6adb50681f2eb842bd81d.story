Missing: Erika Kacicova, 13, was last seen leaving her home in Darnell, Sheffield, five days ago

A 13-year-old schoolgirl missing for more than a week was found safe and well last night as police arrested five people over her disappearance.

Erika Kacicova vanished from her family home in Sheffield on Monday last week, and despite media appeals from her family never made contact.

She was finally tracked down to an address 40 miles away in Centenary Square in Bradford city centre at 6.40pm.

Erika was alone in the property when she was discovered.

Yesterday morning, before she was found, a 37-year-old man from Bradford was arrested on suspicion of child abduction.

Then, in a dramatic development last night, police said they had arrested three other men and a woman for abduction.

One was a 41-year-old man, but there were no details of the other two men and the woman.

On Friday, police arrested a 22-year-old man from Bradford on suspicion of child abduction. He was released on bail on Sunday.

The ‘bubbly and very popular’ schoolgirl is thought to have been befriended by older men on the internet before she disappeared.

As part of the South Yorkshire Police 
inquiry, her computer was taken away to establish exactly who she had 
been in contact with in the lead up to her disappearance.

Earlier yesterday Erika’s bereft mother Janna, 30, hurt her chin after a car crash in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

Last night Mr Kacicova said he was delighted Erika had been found.

He said: ‘We are very happy and just want to see her now. We are happy that she is safe.’

Earlier, the unemployed former parking
attendant said he was horrified by the thought that Erika may have been
targeted by older men over the internet.

He said: ‘She is just a child and these are grown men. Why are they speaking with my daughter and spending time with her?

‘This is not right. She is very young and these men are not behaving in the proper way.’

Police described the 22-year-old’s 
relationship with the girl as ‘a friendship’, but said the man was still
‘of interest’ to the inquiry.

Mr Kacicova, who lives with his wife 
Jana and Erika’s younger sister, Bozena, ten, and brother Stefan, 11, 
said the teenager had met an older unnamed man online before she 
disappeared.

Relieved: Erika Kacicova's father Stefan (pictured here with his other daughter Bozena, ten) said his 'beautiful' daughter had got to know a man of Pakistani origin on Facebook before disappearing a week ago

Travelled 40 miles: Erika Kacicova's home is in Darnall, Sheffield, where she was last seen last Monday at 4pm. She was found in Centenary Square in Bradford city centre, yesterday at 6:40pm

He added: ‘She was speaking to this 
man on Facebook and we found out and told her to stop but it is very 
difficult with children.’

Erika’s family have been informed and 
she is in the care of police officers in Bradford. Erika had been last 
seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family’s home in Darnall, 
Sheffield.

More than 50 police officers joined the search for the youngster.

Detectives said they carried out 
‘extensive inquiries’, speaking to various people they believed were in 
contact with Erika in the last couple of days.

Detective Inspector Helen Tate, from 
South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘It’s fantastic that we now have Erika 
safe and well, and a successful conclusion to the search.

‘Our primary aim now is to concentrate
on Erika’s wellbeing and begin to piece together her movements since 
she left home last Monday.’

Injured: Janna Kacicova, mother of Erika, who was in a car accident yesterday and is now recovering at her home

Missing: Erika was last seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family's home in Darnall, Sheffield

She added: ‘I have personally been 
overwhelmed by the way the public and the media have responded to our 
appeals and I am extremely grateful for their help and support.’

She later said at a press conference: ‘We now have five people in custody on suspicion on child abduction.’

Detective Tate refused to comment on whether Erika had been targeted by a ‘grooming gang’.

The family moved to Britain from Slovakia two years ago.

Detectives took a computer and a mobile phone from their home for further analysis.

Erika previously went missing about three months ago but she returned home after 24 hours.

Officers had described the incident as
‘critical’ and teachers and family members appealed to Erika to get in 
touch to say that she is safe and well.

Last sighting: Erika was last seen leaving her home in Darnell, Sheffield, around 4pm on Monday afternoon
