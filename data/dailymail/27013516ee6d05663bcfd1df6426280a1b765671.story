A best man accused of brutally stabbing his friend and killing his pal's wife was so close to the couple he dined at their house every week and even went on vacation with them, it has emerged.

Jamie Kirk Hahn, 29, died on Wednesday from injuries she suffered when she and her husband, 27-year-old Nation Hahn, were stabbed at their home in Raleigh, North Carolina on Monday night.

Jonathan Broyhill, 31, a close friend of the couple who had previously worked with Jamie and acted as Nation's best man at their wedding, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder.

Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, was released from WakeMed Hospital after treatment and was seen with a bandaged arm as he went to his wife's bedside.

On Wednesday, he wrote a string of emotional tweets to pay tribute to his young wife.

'I have no idea what I'm going to do with @jamiehahn,' he wrote. 'She was my center, my rock and my soulmate... It is almost unfathomable that the sun can shine without [her] here.'

Friends told theÂ Charlotte Observer how, on Monday nights, the three close friends would meet at the Hahn's home for dinner, but tragedy unfolded during this week's meet up.

An unidentified woman called 911 around 5.30pm Monday to report that Jamie was 'bleeding terribly' from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen as she lay in a neighbor's yard.

'I don't know where she ran here from,' the woman said, adding that many people had gathered to press towels against her stomach.

The dispatcher asked the caller who had carried out the stabbing, and a voice responded: 'Jon Broyhill', the Observer reported.

When police arrived on the scene, they followed a trail of blood back to Tealwood Place and found Broyhill inside the Hahns' home, authorities said.

Broyhill was also sent to WakeMed to 
recover from non-life threatening injuries, which are self-inflicted, according to WNCT.

Police have charged Broyhill with 
attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill 
inflicting serious injury, but have not revealed a motive.

relationship the three shared - enjoying watching sports games at home 
and traveling abroad to share holidays.

On Wednesday, the community paid tribute to the bright, popular woman, who had set up her own business, Sky Blue Strategies, to help politicians and campaigns fundraise.

She and her husband both graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009.

'Jamie lost her struggle to live this 
morning. We lost a beautiful and loving wife, daughter and friend. We 
all lost a pure and brave spirit,' her family said in a statement early on Wednesday morning.

'Jamie is a ray of sunshine,' state Sen.
 Josh Stein, who knew all three, said. 'She's always smiling. She 
absolutely brings cheer wherever she goes, and that this has happened is
 tragic.'

'As a friend, this is devastating,' 
friend Gary Pearce told the Observer. 'Nation and Jamie are the finest, 
kindest, gentlest and most generous people you will ever meet.'

Following the tragedy, Nation Hahn talked about his wife at Pullen Memorial.

'She would be the first one to forgive this act of violence against her,' he said.

According to the Observer, in 2010 
Broyhill managed the field campaign for Jane Dyer, a pilot in South 
Carolina who was running for a U.S. congressional seat.

He also worked with former U.S. Rep. Brad Miller of Raleigh.

Nation Hahn worked on former U.S. Sen. John Edwards' presidential campaign and has also helped as an online strategist and with mail campaigns.

Among those he's worked with is the Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families, a campaign opposed to the state constitutional amendment that limits marriage to a union between a man and a woman.
