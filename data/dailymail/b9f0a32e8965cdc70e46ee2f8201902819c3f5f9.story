Adrian Muir has been jailed for 18 years for the manslaughter of Pamela Jackson

A son has said 'there's no justice' after the man who killed his mother before burying her body in a shallow moorland grave 120 miles away was jailed for 18 years.

Adrian Muir killed much-loved mother and grandmother Pamela Jackson at her home in Chester-le-Street, County
 Durham, then transported her corpse in the back of his car to the moors
 near Halifax in West Yorkshire.

He was cleared of murdering Ms Jackson but was found guilty of manslaughter at Newcastle Crown Court following a four week trial.

Ms Jackson’s son Andrew Jackson today said Muir would only serve half the 18 year term.

He said: 'Nine years for a man that’s capable of killing someone and burying them on the moors - there’s no justice.'

Muir, 51, used a spade to dig a grave on the moors near Halifax before burying 55-year-old Ms Jackson's body along with a bunch of flowers in a Tesco carrier bag.

Sentencing him at Newcastle Crown Court today, Judge James Goss QC said Muir killed Ms Jackson by 'striking her repeatedly to the head and then when she was on the ground delivering a blow or blows to her head of such force that she suffered fractures to her skull and bleeding to her brain'.

He said: 'Your reaction to assaulting her was to remove her body from her house, take her to West Yorkshire, where you concealed and buried her high on the Pennines in a grave which I have no doubt you intended would never be found and be unknown to anyone besides you.'

The public gallery erupted into chaos as Ms Jackson’s family broke down and shouted angrily at Muir, who showed no emotion, at the trial’s conclusion.

During the trial the court heard that Muir had made a series of taped confessions about what he had done before joining her family who were frantically searching for her.

Muir was arrested and charged with murder just days after the grandmother and mother-of-three was reported missing.

But it took detectives, who launched a nationwide search, two months to track down Ms Jackson’s grave site on moorland Muir knew 'every inch' of due to his fell running, outdoor hobbies and work commitments as a dry-stone waller in the area.

She had died as a result of blunt force injury to the head caused by at least four blows.

Muir, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, had denied murder and claimed he had been framed by the 'real killer'. After two days of deliberation a jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

Muir's telephone and car had been traced travelling from Ms Jackson’s home to her grave site on the last day her family saw her alive, his fingerprint being found on the carrier bag inside her grave, and a CCTV camera caught Muir cleaning the back of his Kia in a Chester-le-Street supermarket.

Jurors heard during the trial how Muir left his partner of 32-years after he met Ms Jackson over dating website Fling.com.

The court heard Ms Jackson moved Muir into her home shortly after they met but their relationship had deteriorated rapidly in the weeks before her death.

During a series of text messages from that time messages showed the couple had argued and she had goaded him about having another lover.

Muir claimed in the first recording he made on his mobile phone after the killing that 'things went wrong', and Ms Jackson had ordered him out of her house.

He then said on the tape: 'She were like a bloody devil. She got my knife and tried attacking me with it, and I got it off her and shoved her down and she hurt her head and that.

'I can’t explain, but it were a disaster and I’m heartbroken. I can’t live. I can’t live anymore.'

During the second recording, Muir speaks about money and talks of killing himself.

In the third, Muir speaks of Ms Jackson, whom he called Chrissie, and said: 'I love Chrissie to bits, but she isn’t here now and I did a terrible thing.'

Geoff Mason, spokesperson for the Crime Prosecution Service North East, said after the sentencing: 'We are satisfied that Adrian Muir has been held accountable for his actions earlier this year and that justice has been done.

'Since killing Pamela Jackson in March he has acted utterly without remorse.

'Muir fabricated Facebook entries to convince others she was alive and lied to her sons about their mother’s whereabouts. Throughout a series of lengthy interviews with the police he denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, her death.

'He continued to lie in the face of the huge volume of forensics and telecommunications evidence linking him to Soyland Moor where Pamela was found and, at trial, even made wild accusations of a conspiracy against him in his efforts to evade justice.

'Each and every one of his actions has been motivated by a cowardly sense of self-preservation, with little concern for the impact they would have on the family and friends of Pamela Jackson.

'His actions have greatly extended the suffering and grief of those who loved Pamela, simply to serve his own selfish ends.

'The recovery of Pamela’s body was only achieved as a result of the determination and dedication of the Durham Police who refused to give up until she was found and her body returned to her family.

'We hope that Pamela’s family are satisfied with the sentence passed on Muir today and we extend our deepest sympathies to them at what must be a very difficult time.'

Ms Jackson's nephew Paul Gilroy said: 'The past six months can only be described as horrendous and heart wrenching for our family, and no question the hardest thing we ever had to deal with.

'We feel a sense of injustice for Pamela. No amount of time behind bars will compensate our loss.'

Ms Jackson’s sister, Deborah Leighton, 51, said: 'If he had admitted it in the first place he wouldn’t have put the family through such pain.'

Another of Ms Jackson’s sisters, Marion Elsinor, 52, said: 'She was very loving, very loving to her family. She loved her children. The family get a life sentence.'
