On the loose: Paroled rapist David McKenzie, pictured in September 2013, is on the loose in Southern California and has been harassing the family of his 80-year-old victim with dozens of threatening and obscene phone calls

A paroled rapist is on the loose in Southern California and has been harassing the family of his 80-year-old victim with dozens of threatening and obscene phone calls.

Authorities said Wednesday that Dennis Michael McKenzie, 58, is missing after he cut off his GPS locator and disappeared from a Long Beach halfway house.

Police have asked for the public's help as they search for McKenzie, who they claim is a threat to his elderly victim and to the wider public.

It wasn't immediately known how long McKenzie has been on the lam, but authorities took a photo of him last month after he was picked up on a parole violation and put in jail for five days, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller.

Over the past month McKenzie has made more than 50 phone calls from his Long Beach apartment to the victim's family in the San Bernardino Mountains.

They wouldn't elaborate on the threats, but the push to catch McKenzie has been amplified because of the calls.

'He's a threat not only to the victim, but he's a threat, in general, to public safety,' Miller said.

A message seeking comment from the California Department of Corrections was not immediately returned Wednesday.

McKenzie was convicted of raping an 80-year-old woman and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2004.

Phone calls: Over the past month McKenzie has made more than 50 phone calls from his Long Beach apartment in the 2200 block of West Wardlow Road, pictured, to the victim's family in the San Bernardino Mountains

The sexual assault occurred during a burglary, according to court documents.

Authorities don't believe McKenzie has relatives in Southern California, but he does have a history of frequenting the Lake Arrowhead area and Palm Springs.

He has been added to the list of the Mountain's Most Wanted Fugitives by the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department. He is described as a white male, 5-feet 11-inches tall, brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information about McKenzie are urged to contact Deputy M. Chavez or Detective S. Thies at the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department at (909) 336-0600.
