Arsene Wenger attacked Serbian referee Milorad Mazic after Aaron Ramsey was sent off in Arsenal’s stormy Champions League qualifier against Besiktas.

Wenger, who narrowly missed being hit by a bottle thrown from the stands at the final whistle, was angry with the officiating inside the intimidating Ataturk Stadium after they escaped with a 0-0 draw.

Ramsey picked up two yellow cards, Mikel Arteta came off with an ankle injury after Demba Ba fouled him and Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic was sent off in the final seconds.

Fuming: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger describes the decision to send off Ramsey as 'wrong'

Arsenal have reported the bottle thrown incident to UEFA and the governing body will open an investigation into the matter today. Wenger said: ‘Neither the first nor the second yellow card was deserved. When you see some of the fouls made tonight and we go home with Ramsey red carded, it's a bit unbelievable.

‘I think it was a very bad challenge on Arteta, but the referee was on the pitch and didn't make anything of it. In the second half the performance of the referee was very bad. Arteta turned his ankle on the tackle.

‘To send off Ramsey was wrong and it was a huge decision. I felt just a lot was wrong in the second half but, overall, it was a difficult game maybe to referee as well. ‘Everybody did fight for every ball. Maybe it was not easy for the referee as well.

‘The referee had a few conversations with Bilic in the second half and, in the end, sent him off. He can explain that much better. I don't know really why he sent him off.’ Wenger also confirmed that he has made a complaint to UEFA after a missile was launched at him after the final whistle.

Sour note: Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta (second left) had to be replaced due to injury

Arsenal face Besiktas in the second leg on Wednesday, with the draw for the group phase of the Champions League in Monaco the following day.

Arsenal returned to London overnight and will assess the injury to Arteta today as they begin preparations for Saturday’s trip to Everton.

Wenger’s World Cup trio are all expected to be in the squad after the Arsenal manager confirmed they will be available.

He said: ‘We are a bit short at the back, yes you're right. I'm worried. But we should have Mertesacker and Ozil and Podolski available again at the weekend. Let's hope they are in good shape when we go home.’
