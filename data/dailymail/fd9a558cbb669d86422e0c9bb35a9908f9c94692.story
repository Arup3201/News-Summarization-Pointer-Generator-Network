A healthcare assistant who lost 14 stone after receiving a gastric band died five years later because of delayed complications, an inquest has heard.

Elise Ann Hedgecock, 35, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, suffered a perforated ulcer as a result of the operation she had in 2008.

This led to an infection known as peritonitis, an inflammation of the tissue which lines the abdomen, which subsequently caused her death.

Procedure: Elise Ann Hedgecock opted for a gastric band operation at Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester when she weighed 24 stone

The inquest heard she had been overweight
 for most of her adult life and in October 2008, when she weighed 24 
stone, she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery at Salford Royal 
Hospital.

The surgeon who performed the procedure said ulcers were a known risk of the operation, but told the hearing at Bolton Coroner's Court it was unusual for them to occur such a long time after.

On the day of her death in November last year, Miss Hedgecock’s father, Philip, travelled to her house in Walkden, Greater Manchester, and realised the door was locked from the inside.

He rang the police before going in through the back door.

When officers arrived he asked them to look upstairs where they found Ms Hedgecock in the bathroom. An ambulance was called but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Surgeon: Professor Basil Ammori, who performed the procedure, told the inquest it was unusual for patients to suffer ulcers so long after the operation

Miss Hedgecock, who had been working at Salford Royal Hospital, was described by her father as a 'popular lady' who had many friends and loved karaoke.

The inquest heard she had been overweight for most of her adult life and in October 2008, she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery at Salford Royal Hospital.

The surgery re-routes the digestive system past most of the stomach so the person requires a lot less food to feel full.

Miss Hedgecock lost 14 stone (88 kgs) after her operation. The surgery was carried out by Professor Basil Ammori who told the inquest: 'She was reviewed in May 2009 and there were no problems, her body mass index dropped so she was no longer morbidly obese and was now in the moderately overweight category.'

Found: Miss Hedgecock was found in the bathroom of her home in Walkden, Greater Manchester, last year

Prof Ammori said: 'According to my research the risk of ulcers happening after gastric bypass surgery is one in 120 and this usually happens in the first 18 months.'

Coroner Geoffrey Saul recorded a narrative verdict, confirming Ms Hedgecock died at home from peritonitis.

He said: 'She died from a late complication from gastric bypass surgery.'

Speaking after the inquest, her father, Mr Hedgecock said: 'There is no blame attached at all and after the surgery Elise had a better quality of life.

'She was dearly loved and will be sorely missed.'

Tribute: Speaking after the inquest at Bolton Coroner's Court, Phillip Hedgecock said: 'There is no blame attached at all and after the surgery Elise had a better quality of life'
