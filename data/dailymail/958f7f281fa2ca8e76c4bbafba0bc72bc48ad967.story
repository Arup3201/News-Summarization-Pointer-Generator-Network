A Parkinson's disease sufferer has ‘cured’ her symptoms by dancing to Mud's ‘Tiger Feet’.

Christine Reeve has suffered from the disease for eight years but has only recently found she can walk and talk normally while listening to certain types of music.

The 73-year-old from Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, has always loved dancing - but thought she'd never be able to hit the dance floor again when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Christine Reeve (pictured with her physiotherapist, Fiona Lindop) has discovered that listening to music helps her to cope with the symptoms of her Parkinson's disease

But doctors were stunned when she realised her body responded to music with a 'marching' beat - and she could walk around normally when listening to certain tunes.

Mrs Reeve discovered the bizarre quirk when she told her physiotherapist she longed to 'have a little jig' - and he found her an iPod with some tunes.

She said: ‘Without the music, I'm just somebody who has Parkinson's - with it, it's like an instant fix. It's like I'm back in control of myself again.

‘I started with “Tiger Feet” by Mud, and then some marching music - and I found, with the right beat, I suddenly had control over what I did.

‘I could march backwards and forwards, I could jig on the spot and I could dance.

‘It only worked while the music was on and with certain songs but, with things like “Tiger Feet”, I could kick about and I just had this confidence I didn't have before.’

Mrs Reeve was told she had Parkinson's disease eight years ago, after she found she was dragging her foot and noticed problems with her right hand.

The disease often leaves her feeling unwell and struggling to move about the house.

After her diagnosis, she was referred to the hospital for support on how to manage her condition.

1) Marches for the Connoisseur - the Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards

2) Tiger Feet - Mud

3) Bad Moon Rising - Creedence Clearwater Revival

4) Scarlet and Gold Fanfare - the Band of the Grenadier Guards

5) McNamara's Band - Bing Crosby

This included a six-week course about the condition, medication, physiotherapy and advice from a dietician.

But, some days, Mrs Reeve said Parkinson's left her feeling ‘off-colour’ and ‘fragile’, with walking and even talking difficult.

The pensioner said: ‘To begin with, I was devastated and I was really worried about what having the condition would mean for me.

‘On top of that, I didn't like the idea of going to hospital regularly because of it. I really struggled with that and was plucking up the courage to go.’

As a result of the disease Mrs Reeve finds it extremely difficult to multi-task, and struggles with walking and talking at the same time.

Her husband Peter, 72, said: ‘There's a lot of things you can't do when you have Parkinson's which I guess we would all take for granted.

‘So, for example, Christine can't 
multi-task very well. If we walk into the village and I talk to her, she
 has to stop before she can speak back.

Mrs Reeve was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago and without music she struggled to walk, and even to talk. She says the music gives her a break from the symptoms

‘If we go for a walk somewhere she has to constantly look down and pick her feet up over tree roots. Things are an effort.’

But when Mrs Reeve puts on headphones and hears certain songs - in particular marching band music - her body responds and she has even able to dance.

Mr Reeve said: ‘Christine is always of good cheer but Parkinson's can sometimes, understandably, leave her feeling low.

‘But her eyes just seem to light up when the music plays.

‘When we 
go on a walk, it's usually me leading the way and Christine dragging 
across the fields behind me but, with her headphones on, she walks like 
normal.

Mrs Reeve says music helps her temporarily regain control of her body

‘We can't explain it but it just has such an all-round positive effect on her.’

Mrs Reeve added: ‘I like music with a deep, resounding beat but it's got to be the right beat.

‘That's why I like the marches so much. A strong beat and a good bass - those are the things which work best.

Parkinson's disease is a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively more and more damaged over many years.

It causes involuntary shaking and tremors, muscle stiffness and a slowing down of the physical movements.

It can also result in depression, daytime sleepiness and swallowing difficulties.

Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain.

This leads to a reduction in the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain.

This chemical plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body.

It
 is not known exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells but a 
combination of genetics and environmental factors are thought to be 
responsible.

About one in every 500 people develop Parkinson's disease and most people start to develop symptoms around the age of 60.

One in 20 cases develop in people under the age of 50.

There is no cure for Parkinson's disease and it is not fatal so many patients have a near-normal life expectancy.

However, it can cause severe disability in people who respond less well to treatment.

‘I'm not as bothered about the lyrics; it's all about the music. It's like the music lets me have a break.’

Fiona Lindop, from the Parkinson's team at Derby's London Road Community Hospital, said they are extremely impressed with her progress.

Now they have applied for funding to carry out further research into the link between Parkinson's disease and music.

Ms Lindop said: ‘It really was miraculous to see. All of Christine's anxiety seemed to disappear with the music.

‘It was almost like the music freed up Christine's mind and took the effort away she normally faces when walking or talking. The music seemed to take over.’

She added that she had not seen anything like it before but had started using music to help other patients.

She said: ‘We know that using a metronome can sometimes help patients with Parkinson's. It's a technique called cueing and, like the music, it helps with walking because it sets the pace.

‘But I can't quite find anyone using music quite like this and, when I showed videos of Christine's progress at a congress in Montreal, they were fascinated.

‘I've tried it since with four others, with different results. One gentleman didn't respond to marching music but did to “I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)” by the Proclaimers.

‘And another gentleman did get on well with the marching music and said it reminded him of his past.’

Ms Lindop and her team have now applied to Parkinson's UK for £35,000 and the Dunhill Medical Trust, a charity which offers grants, for £36,000 to carry out research.

The pilot study would aim to show music was more effective than a metronome in helping people with Parkinson's walk as well as looking at effects other symptoms, such as insomnia, difficulty swallowing, dementia and cognitive impairment.

Parkinson's disease is an incurable neurological condition and symptoms include tremors, rigidity and slowness of movement. It can also cause tiredness, pain and depression.
