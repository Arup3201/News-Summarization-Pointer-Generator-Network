Builders were temporarily banned from working at Dawn French's cliff-top mansion after a worker was seen precariously dangling from scaffolding - 60ft above rocks.

Health and safety chiefs served the order after a passer-by complained about alarming scenes while workers fixed up the comic's 40-room home. 

The builders were seen clambering over the scaffolding poles at Point Neptune House in Fowey, Cornwall, but did not appear to wear harnesses or helmets for their series of risky manoeuvres.

Builders were forced to stop work on Dawn French's 40-room mansion in 
Fowey, Cornwall, after a passer-by complained to health and safety 
chiefs about some of the workers' perilous positions

One builder was seen scrambling over the scaffolding poles as he worked on the comic's seaside abode - but did not appear to be wearing a harness or a helmet

One worker was pictured stretching his entire body out from the scaffolding and brazenly leaning face-first into the cliff.

A second worker was also spotted balancing on the scaffolding in front of the mansion's huge-arched windows, as material was lowered to his colleagues below.

After complaints, the Health and Safety Executive ordered Heritage Cornwall Ltd to stop work immediately on the Grade II-listed property until they had 'put it right'.

According to The People, one parent had marched to the gate of the 
mansion and went 'absolutely balistic' when some material allegedly fell close to where his
 children were playing on the rocks.

The set up, seen here, alarmed some by-passers who complained to the Health and Safety Executive about the seemingly risky manoeuvres

One worker was seen climbing on the rocks below the work station. Some complained that the material had landed near to where children were playing

One of the workers was seen clmbing down the wall, but did not use a ladder. A notice was issued against Heritage Cornwall Ltd for the work to stop immediately

A passer-by told the paper: 'The builders were passing buckets to each other and stuff was falling out of them.

'A guy on the beach was going absolutely balistic because something landed on rocks near his children.'

A HSE spokesman confirmed a prohibition notice had been issued against Heritage Cornwall Ltd in connection with 'issues about access to the work area'.

The HSE said the notice related to issues about 'access to the work area' but that it had now been put right

It said the firm, which were reportedly carrying out work to strengthen a wall on the cliffs, had to stop work 'immediately' but that the issue had now been resolved.

Dramatically set on a windswept bluff overlooking the Cornish coast, Dawn French's home is considered by locals to be the most desirable house for miles around.

It is set just miles away from the real-life manifestation of Manderley - the house featured in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca.

French bought the house in 2006 with her ex-husband, Lenny Henry, for a reported £2.6m. She now lives there with husband, Mark Bignell.

Neither a spokesman for Dawn French nor the building company were available for comment.
