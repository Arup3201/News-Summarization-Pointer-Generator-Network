A couple who were taking their two-year-old daughter on a walk in the country were shocked to come across two men enjoying a spanking session in broad daylight. 

Parents Allan Pagan and Natalie Fairhurst stumbled upon the scene while they were taking their little girl out on her pony near Waterbeck in Dumfriesshire.

They said their daughter was 'thankfully oblivious' when they spotted a man in a blonde wig and a cream dress tied to a farm gate who was being whipped by another man dressed in a spiked-studded collar, chains and a leather harness.

Allan Pagan was shocked to see a man in a blonde wig being whipped by another dressed in a full bondage outfit while on a country walk  with his two-year-old daughter near Waterbeck in Dumfriesshire

Mr Pagan, 39, told the Daily Record: 'We thought it was a woman until the person turned round and you could see his big Adam's apple. 

'I've heard about things like this before but I never thought I'd see it with my own eyes by the side of a B road 50 yards away from my house.'

Ms Fairhurst, 35, reported the incident on Saturday to police after noting the registration number of the car in which the two men, thought to be in their late 50s, fled. 

She said: 'It was broad daylight and my kids and other walkers and horse riders go along there regularly.

'It seemed like they wanted to be caught but I don't think they expected it to be us, because to say we were raging is an understatement.'

A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed they were investigation a report of two men acting in an 'inappropriate manner'.

He said: 'We are investigating a report of two males acting in an inappropriate manner near to a road end at a farm near Waterbeck at around 5.30pm on Saturday October 18. 

'The first man, in his late 50s or early 60s, is about 5’8” tall, medium build, short thinning grey hair, and was wearing a white shirt, a spiked studded collar with chains and a leather harness.

'The second man is in his late 50s, 5’8” tall, wearing a blond wig and a cream dress. 

'Both men left the scene in a grey coloured car when disturbed.'

Anyone with information should call Police Scotland on 101.
