Tory MP Stewart Jackson claims he is being 'bullied' by the expenses watchdog

A Tory MP is being sued by the expenses watchdog after refusing to hand over the capital gain on his taxpayer-funded second home.

Stewart Jackson vowed he will not pay £54,000 – the amount the watchdog said represents his constituency home’s increase in value while he was claiming mortgage interest on his expenses.

The news comes after it emerged that MPs have jointly made more than £1 million by selling their second homes.

The revelation prompted accusations that MPs were making a profit using taxpayers' money.

Mr Jackson, the MP for Peterborough, is the only one of 29 MPs to have refused the demand by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to pay up.

The other MPs, including four Cabinet ministers, have agreed to repay a total of £484,828.

The money is to cover a proportion of the increased value of their second homes funded by the taxpayer through a mortgage interest subsidy.

Welsh Secretary David Jones was forced to repay the most – £81,446 – for a home in London.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond handed over £34,884. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson paid £7,755 and Kenneth Clarke, a minister without portfolio, paid £737.

Treasury minister David Gauke repaid £26,762.76, universities minister David Willetts £7,730.74, and former farming minister Sir Jim Paice £9,177.12.

During the expenses scandal, a string of MPs were accused of making big financial gains on their second homes. There was public fury over the practice of ‘flipping’ the designation of second homes to claim more taxpayers’ cash and over other abuses.

The expenses watchdog Ipsa has reached deals with 70 MPs to repay some of the profit from homes bought with taxpayers' money

IPSA said yesterday that it had launched legal action at the High Court to recover the cash from Mr Jackson.

But the MP said he would not pay up 
and claimed that his constituency home had fallen in value since he 
bought it for £470,000 at the end of 2005.

Lorely Burt, Liberal Democrat - £180,000

Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat - £110,000

Angela Smith, Labour - £170,000

Nigel Dodds, Democratic Unionist - £152, 823

Hazel Blears, Labour - £120,000

David Gauke, Tory Exchequer Secretary - £67,000

He accused IPSA of rushing 
into ‘heavy-handed and disproportionate’ litigation which was ‘clearly 
intended to bully me into submission’.

IPSA
banned the use of Commons expenses to pay mortgage interest in May 
2010. But transitional arrangements allowed MPs elected before 2010 to 
keep claiming the money up to last August – as long as they agreed to 
return any potential capital gain.

Martin Bell, the former MP who has campaigned for greater transparency, said that MPs should repay any profit.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It's an open and shut case, of course they should pay it back.

'There is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? In this case they very clearly are.'

Mr Jackson said: 'All British citizens are entitled 
to seek legal adjudication if the State’s actions are unfair or possibly
illegal and so I will be forcefully resisting their precipitous 
litigation.'

Martin Bell, a former MP, said MPs should repay any profit they made on their properties

He disputes Ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent.

'At
my own expense, I have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and
I have made a reasonable offer to IPSA to settle the matter and reduce 
the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer.

'My
valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the 
taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and 
2012, in order to fulfill my duties as both a London based legislator 
and a constituency MP. 

'IPSA
have negotiated with 70 other MPs in a secretive and arbitrary manner 
but in respect of my case, regrettably, they have refused to negotiate.

'I am merely seeking fair play and consistency and will pursue legal action to receive it.'

Payback: Treasury minister David Gauke and former farming Sir Jim Paice have returned thousands of pounds

An Ipsa spokesman said: 'One of the 
most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where MPs
got taxpayer support to own a second home. That is why we said we would
stop this, and we have now done so.

'The
final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short 
transition period for MPs who were already committed to second 
mortgages.

'But in doing 
this we set the condition that the taxpayer would want its share of any 
increase in the value of the property. Today we are publishing that 
these capital gains are worth almost £500,000 to the taxpayer.

'MPs
knew this was the deal and agreed to the conditions at the start. In 
valuing the property, it was important that we didn't rely on amateur 
valuations or guesses from the web.

'Instead,
we demanded formal valuations at the start and end, from the Royal 
Institute of Chartered Surveyors - the most authoritative voice in this 
field.

'We would only accept valuations from RICS members or fellows - providing proper assurance on the value of the properties.

'We
required all MPs to provide these independent valuations at the start 
and end of the claim period. And we published the way in which the 
capital gain would be calculated. The same method of calculation has 
been applied to all 71 cases.

'Stewart
Jackson provided us with two RICS valuations. As he has been unwilling 
to pay the £54,000 due we have issued proceedings to recover the sum 
through the High Court.'

Among
those not asked for repayments were Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, 
who claimed £9,104 on a home in his Sheffield constituency, and David 
Miliband, who claimed £5,903 on a property in his former seat of South 
Shields.
