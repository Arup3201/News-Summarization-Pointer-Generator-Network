A woman whose mother abducted her as an infant and took her overseas more than 20 years ago stood in a courtroom Tuesday, fighting back tears, and told a judge she has had a good life even though she didn't know her birth father growing up.

'I was raised very fortunately. I was loved beyond belief,' Samantha Geldenhuys, 21, told U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel after her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, pleaded guilty to parental kidnapping and two counts of falsifying passport applications.

The judge sentenced the 54-year-old Barnett — who lived in Isle of Palms when she took her daughter 10-month-old daughter in 1994 — to 21 months in prison followed by two years' supervised parole. 

She is expected to be released in a few months because she gets credit for time served since her arrest in November 2013.

Prison: Dorothy Lee Barnett, charged with kidnapping her infant daughter from South Carolina and fleeing overseas more than 20 years ago, was sentenced to 21 months in a U.S. prison

Dorothy Lee Barnett (left) was found by Australian and US police in November 2013 living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd (right), after allegedly abducting her 20 years ago. She denied the charges after being extradited to Charleston, South Carolina, but eventually plead guilty

'I was loved - I had no idea': During an Australian TV interview last year, Savanna Todd - Samantha Geldenhuys - explained how she only found out about her kidnapping when her mom was arrested

That's after she was tracked down in Australia, where she had been living under another name since 2007. It was the first time her daughter learned about her past.

'It was a shock to me, and this is the last place I expected to be standing,' Geldenhuys said. 'It could have been great to grow up here.'

She said she recently spent time with her birth father, Benjamin Harris Todd III. He had legal custody after her parents divorced.

'That was an experience I cannot describe in words,' she said.

According to court records, Todd and Barnett went through an acrimonious divorce in February 1994. The family court found that 'the mother steadfastly rejected that the father had a role of value to the child and that she and the child would be better off if he were not in the picture at all,' records said.

Prosecutors said that a few months later, Barnett left for a birthday party during a visit with her daughter, then called Savanna Catherine Todd and nearly a year old, and didn't return. Barnett was eventually located in Australia and fought extradition but was returned to the U.S. om September.

Barnett told authorities that she fled to Malaysia and then South Africa, where she met and married Juan Geldenhuys, who is now dead. She said the family later lived in Botswana, New Zealand, and Australia, moving for her husband's employment. 

Barnett did not have custody of Savanna when she took her from her American father to attend a birthday party and failed to return in 1994

She told authorities that over 20 years, the only person she had contact with in the United States was her brother, who has since died.

Before sentencing, Barnett told the court that she had separated from Todd while pregnant with her daughter. She thanked God for all the friends who have been taking care of her daughter and her son since her arrest.

'Ms. Barnett, there are no winners in this situation,' the judge told her.

Geldenhuys didn't comment as she was hurried from the courthouse into a car.

Benjamin Todd didn't appear at the hearing. The attorney who represented him in his divorce, Graham Sturgis, spoke to the judge on his behalf.

He read a note Todd wrote after his daughter disappeared, imagining himself looking down the driveway: 'Someday my daughter will be looking there for me.'

Sturgis said his client 'feels that justice has been served and is focusing on getting to know his daughter.'

Barnett's attorney, Russell Mace III, said he didn't know whether Geldenhuys would remain in the United States or return to Australia.

He also said Barnett's sentence was an expected one. He said that Barnett could be free 'in 11 or 12 weeks and perhaps sooner.'

The charges of falsifying passport applications each carried a maximum sentence of 10 years; parental kidnapping, a maximum of three.

But in federal court, judges get a range of sentences based on a report that considers matters such as the nature of the crime and previous convictions. Barnett had none. The report suggested 15 to 21 months.

The judge said he sentenced Barnett to the maximum in the range because 'this was a calculated, methodical crime carried out in a deliberate way.'

Gergel said: 'I don't believe Ms. Barnett is going to commit any other crime. But it is important that others be deterred from taking the law into their own hands.'  

Barnett (pictured left in the 90s and right in an artist impression) was located and arrested in Queensland in November 2013 after she disappeared with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994

Court papers say Samantha's father was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife.

An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her.

He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship.

A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact.  

When she was arrested, Barnett initially agreed to be extradited but she later backed down.

Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered.

'The Minister arrived at his determination following careful consideration of the provisions of Australia's extradition law and taking into account representations made by, and on behalf of, Ms Barnett,' a government spokesman said.

Savanna (pictured left as a baby and right now) was by her mother's side during a court appearance last year when she was denied bail. She held a sign saying: 'We love you Mum'

Supporting her mother: The 21-year-old said she had a normal, loving upbringing and never held a grudge against her mom for not knowing the real story of her upbringing 

The attorney for Mr Todd, Graham Sturgis, told the judge his client never gave up searching the world for his daughter.

Mr Todd wanted Barnett to receive maximum sentencing for what she put him through. 

'He recognizes the need (for Samantha) to love her mother,' Sturgis said. 

'Very few of us will ever know the experience of having lost a child. 

'No punishment will ever make good the loss that Mr. Todd has suffered.'
