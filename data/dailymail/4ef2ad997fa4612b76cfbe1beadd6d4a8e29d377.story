What is the special quality that makes a house a home? Often, that elusive 'something' has its origins in our memories.

This month, a survey of 2,000 new homeowners found more than half felt dissatisfied. But while few first-timers can afford the house of their dreams, the discontent seemed to be caused as much by emotional factors as by more practical considerations.

A common complaint was that their new property didn't 'feel like home', while a quarter admitted they still refer to their parents' house as 'home'.

It was clear that many felt the absence of something intangible - the comforting atmosphere of the place in which they spent their childhood.

But what is it really like to return, as an adult, to the house where you grew up?

I'm writing this article in a room that was built before Columbus reached America. It's a gusty autumn day; the wind mews in the chimney, the logs shift and sigh in the grate.

For centuries, other people have heard these same sounds in this same room. And everything - from the scent of woodsmoke, to the nubbly texture of my great-grandmother's woven curtains, to the deep caramel colour of the never‑since redecorated walls - is familiar to me from my earliest childhood. I live, you see, in the family house in rural Sussex where I grew up.

In my 20s I lived in London, but when my eldest son, George, now 24, was a baby, I moved back, and I've been here ever since.

Of my life so far, only about one-fifth has been spent elsewhere, a percentage that shrinks with every passing year. I've been shaped by this house, Hancox, to an unusual degree.

And I consider myself lucky. I feel connected not only to my own past, but to the past of those who've lived here before me - and as the house is more than 500 years old, that’s a lot of (benign) ghosts.

Charlotte says she loves the way the house feels at one with the landscape. Only about one-fifth of her life has been spent elsewhere.

I feel pleasantly rooted in an area I know well. This continuity, I believe, also provides a sense of security for my three sons. Two of them have autism, so for them, the stability that comes from familiarity is doubly important.

Others might feel stuck, or confined, by this arrangement, but I don't. The interplay between the history of the house and our present lives never ceases to fascinate me. I even wrote a book about it.

Hancox, built in the 1480s, is a Wealden hall house - a type of old timber-framed structure often found in the South-East. The passing generations have added or subtracted bits here and there, but in essence, it is still the same unplanned mound of brick and timber it always was.

It's entirely constructed of materials from within a five-mile radius: oak beams, clay tiles, locally forged ironwork, plaster mixed with the chopped red‑brown hair of Sussex cattle. You can see this hair in the many places where childish exuberance has punched holes in the softly bulging walls.

I love the way the house feels at one with the landscape, a russet-coloured mound rising up amidst the tussocky pattern of small hills, small woods, small fields.

Outside, the garden - defined by crumbling walls - merges with the farmyard. A barn, a dairy, a brewhouse and stables stand in dilapidated testimony to the semi-self-sufficiency of the lives of our forebears.

The house came into my family in 1888. If you don't move house, there's less incentive to clear things out, and, besides, I come from a proud race of clutterers. If my great-grandparents came back from the dead, they'd find that remarkably little had changed. True, we do have electric light, we don't draw our water from the 70ft brick-built well outside the kitchen door and the coach-house shelters lawnmowers and power tools instead of pony-traps.

But inside and out, they'd recognise a great deal. Furniture, window frames, latches, door handles, kitchen utensils, even some of the carpets and curtains have remained.

Lifestyle features and TV programmes show us perfectly decorated living rooms, immaculately functional bathrooms, streamlined kitchens. But all these tempting images appeal to one sense only - sight. And a home isn't just something to be looked at. Sounds, smells and textures cannot be experienced on a screen or between the pages of a magazine, however glossy.

Our early experience of home is conveyed to us through all our senses; on an unconscious level, this never leaves us.

Outside, I can hear the swish of 21st-century traffic. Inside, the washing machine is shrieking at me to tell me it's finished its load. But the sheep bleating in the barn, the squeaking of the pine trees as they rub their branches together in the wind, form a timeless aural tapestry - rarely consciously noticed - linking my present to my past, and to the lives of so many before me.

I am aware that I live in a highly unusual house. Would I feel so strongly if I had grown up somewhere less special?

Perhaps. Simon, my partner, moved into a newly built bungalow in a village near Swindon when he was a toddler.

Seven Sandy Lane was 'utterly ordinary', he says. But, nonetheless, its particular atmosphere defined his Sixties childhood. After little more than half a century, his memories feel 'historical': 'There was one bunker for coal, for the sitting room fire and another for coke for the kitchen boiler.'

There was no central heating. The bedroom he shared with his brother had been intended as a garage, so was built with only a single layer of bricks and faced north-east; curtains glued to the window by frost were the norm for several months of the year.

Today, almost every aspect of Seven Sandy Lane has changed. The brick is covered with pink render, the small front lawn and rosebed have been paved over for parking and a loft extension means it isn't really even a bungalow any more.

Nothing is left of the whiff of Austerity Britain that permeated Simon's childhood.

That's not particularly to be regretted, but the point is that those early experiences - the Formica, the coke, the gravel path, the cork bath mat - still exist in his mind as highly potent memories. 'I even have this slight fondness for Swindon,' he says, 'but I realise it's not particularly rational.'

Emotion and rationality - surely this is where our ideas about 'home', as opposed to choices about 'property', clash?

Unfortunately, modern economics oblige most people to conflate the two. The first home bought by a young couple will almost never be the last. It probably won't even be where they bring up their children.

For the majority, the dwelling place is by far their most valuable asset. We are encouraged to increase its value by adding bathrooms, conservatories and the like. It's not fashionable to leave things as they are.

When the time is ripe, the place is put back on the market; the modern way is to move house every few years.

But while that may all make sound financial sense, is it really compatible with the idea of home?

The dissatisfaction of those first-timers in the survey is unsurprising. 'Home' is something that grows over time. There's no instant fix, whatever the magazines tell us. It's about those early years, when all the imprinting is done.

But I've some comfort for the young parents still secretly pining after their own childhood homes: they are, simultaneously, creating a similar, equally precious, set of memories for their own children.

My son George expresses - with autistic directness - the sentiments that many of us feel. Every day he tells us: 'I want to stay here, in the kitchen at Hancox, all days, all weeks.'

That makes perfect sense to me.
