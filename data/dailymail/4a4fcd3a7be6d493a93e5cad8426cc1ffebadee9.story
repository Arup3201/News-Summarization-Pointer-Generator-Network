A man who served time in prison for two cold blooded-murders, and who judges recommended should never be released, has been declared a free man.

Francis James Carter, 59, was released from the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre, west of Brisbane, on strict parole conditions on Wednesday,The Brisbane Times reports.

A spokeswoman from Queensland Corrective Service's Prisoner Location Line confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carter was not in custody. 

His release has prompted Queensland's Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie to request urgent legal advice regarding the issue and bring attention to the state's minimum non-parole period of 30 years for multiple murders.

Francis James Carter, 59, was released from the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre, west of Brisbane, on strict parole conditions on Wednesday 

Carter, who has only served 25 years in prison, was first locked behind bars in 1989 after killing a man for speaking to his girlfriend at a barbeque, according to author Paul B. Kidd.

Mr Kidd writes in his book, Never To Be Released, that the murder saw the victim beaten to death with a baseball bat before having his throat cut, his fingers removed with a bolt cutter and his body stuffed into a forty-four gallon drum.

'It was one of the most vicious murders I have ever seen,' the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Craig Hintz, was recorded as saying by Mr Kidd.

Less than a year later, Carter was responsible for a second murder, this time while behind bars at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre in Brisbane.

Police forced Carter onto the floor after catching him following his escape from prison in 1991:  He has served 25 years in prison for killing two men

Less than a year after being convicted for his first murder, Carter was one of three inmates who stabbed a fellow prisoner to death at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre in Brisbane

His victim was Scott Wallace, a fellow inmate who Carter and two other prisoners were convinced had informed authorities of their foiled escape plan.

'Drunk on home-brew and armed with knives from the kitchen, the murderers mutilated Wallace in is cell by stabbing him about the face, head, neck and body at least twenty times,' Mr Kidd wrote.

This crime won Carter a second life sentence and the recommendation that he never be released into the public from Mr Justice de Jersey who 'believed Carter would kill again "on the most trivial of provocation"'.

During trial for the murder, the killer managed to lead a prison escape using a home-made ladder which allowed seven inmates to escape for almost a week.

However Carter's criminal history also extends to include armed robberies and an incident in which he assaulted a prison guard in an attempt to take a set of keys that allowed entrance to the sex offender's yard, The Courier Mail reports.

In response to Carter's release this week, Attorney-General Bleijie said: 'We have done more than any other government to ensure violent offenders are kept behind bars.

'We are committed to making this state the safest place to raise a family and we share Queenslanders' frustration when serious offenders are released.' 

A spokeswoman from Queensland Corrective Services told Daily Mail Australia she was unable to confirm the circumstances of the decision to release Carter on parole.
