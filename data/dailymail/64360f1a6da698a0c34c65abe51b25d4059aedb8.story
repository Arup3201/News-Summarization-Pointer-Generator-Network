A teenager bought a cheese and tomato pizza from Domino’s - but had £179,932.32 taken from his bank account.

Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, paid for the £17.99 meal from the takeaway giant with his bank card.

But after checking his account, he was shocked to see it was £179,020.82 overdrawn.

Teenager Nathaniel Bolwell bought a large cheese and tomato pizza and extras from Domino's in Newport, Wales for £17.99 but had £179,932.32 taken from his account when staff added an extra four digits to the price

Mr Bolwell said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. How did it allow Domino’s to take all that money?

'Not even the poshest meal in the poshest restaurant would cost anything like that even if I took all my friends and family out.'

Mr Bolwell bought the pizza at Domino’s in Chepstow Road, Newport, Wales, and noticed nothing out of the ordinary when he paid.

Mr Bolwell's statement highlighted the costly mistake. Lloyds Bank paid the money back two days later

But when his card was refused at a supermaket, he decided to check his account.

He said: 'I thought I was about £400 in credit but I was massively overdrawn.

'I took a print-out of the statement and rang the bank straight away.

'I knew it was wrong - but was terrified that I might have to pay it off or be put on a credit blacklist.'

Domino’s and Lloyds Bank investigated after his father made a phonecall enquiring about the bill.

The money was paid back two days later.

Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, was given £100 compensation from Lloyds Bank after it withdrew £179,932.32 from his account to pay for a pizza

Mr Bolwell, who works as a packer for a health food company, was told Domino's staff were given a bank card authorisation code of 3232 when he paid.

But that was accidentally added to the price when the payment went through in twolots of £90,000 and £89.932.32 - adding up to £179,932.32.

Mr Bolwell's father, Karl, 40, said: 'People are joking that instead of a cheese and tomato pizza it must have been made of gold leaf and diamonds.

'I know takeaways are cheap but that is crazy. I’ve told Nathaniel he can stick to home cooking from now on.'

A spokeswoman for Domino’s said: 'This was immediately flagged by our merchant provider due to the amount and a reversal of funds was put in place.

'Unfortunately the payment was authorised by the customer’s bank.

'We understand that this has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'

A Lloyds Bank spokesperson said it would give Mr Bolwell £100 compensation - and 'sincerely regretted a significant level of distress and inconvenience'.

The spokesperson said: 'We investigated this transaction as soon as it was brought to our attention and are sorry that Mr Bolwell had these funds debited from his account.

'We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and have offered Mr Bolwell £100 in recognition of this.'
