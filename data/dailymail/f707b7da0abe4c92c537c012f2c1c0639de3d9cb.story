Kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch, pictured, has become a recluse because of the 'horror' of contact with other people.

The 26-year-old Austrian has given up her studies and no longer has driving lessons because she panics when she sees her instructor.

She says she no longer wants children and rarely makes new friends – ending her Facebook presence and seldom using Twitter.

Natascha Kampusch was kidnapped at the age of 10 and held captive for eight and a half years

Miss Kampusch was upbeat about her future after freeing herself from Wolfgang Priklopil in 2006 after being kept prisoner for more than eight years.

But nerves have now destroyed her chances of an education. 'The regular contact with fellow students was really a horror scenario for me,' she said.

The story of her ordeal was recently made into a film starring Irish actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes.

Miss Kampusch has also put on weight significantly, in contrast with wafer-thin Campbell-Hughes who admitted she went on a massive diet in order to portray the kidnap victim in 3,096 Days.
