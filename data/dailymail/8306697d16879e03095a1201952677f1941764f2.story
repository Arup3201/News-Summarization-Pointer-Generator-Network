Hundreds of teenagers caused chaos in central Florida, brawling each other after they could not get into a movie theater.

Police in Ocoee,west of Orlando, said that 300 high school and middle school students 'caused a disturbance' outside an AMC theater at the local mall on Saturday night.

After security guards kept most of them out, the crowd was moved to a parking lot where they began fighting each other and shots were fire into the air.

Gunshots were heard coming from a parking lot near the theater, where the crowd was moved after not getting in to the cinema

The resulting investigation led to the discovery of drugs and a stolen car, according to WESH.  

The chaos spread from the mall to a nearby Taco Bell to a gas station where the students were stealing goods and trying to fight the store's owner.

Around 100 teens were able to get inside the cinema. 

Police eventually got the children under control, and they called their parents.

The resulting investigation into the incident, where youths also allegedly stole from a gas station, led to the discovery of drugs and a stolen car

The Ocoee Police Department received help handling the large crowd from nearby towns and the county police

One juvenile was arrested for battery and resisting an officer without violence and another was arrested on misdemeanor drug charges, the Ocoee Police Department said. 

The local police department called in assistance and received help from the neighboring towns Windemere and Winter Garden, along with county officers.

'Our main concern is this: These are middle and high school kids going to a public movie theater, some armed with guns, some firing guns, some fighting in the parking lot, disturbing everyone else there. Not only that, but putting them in danger with the the violence they're creating," Orange County Sheriff's Office Lt. Paul Hopkins said.

No one was seriously hurt in the incident.

'My anxiety hit the roof. I was like, ‘How do we get out?’' moviegoer Jessica Weckerly told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 

She was there with her husband, Brian, for a screening of '50 Shades of Grey' when she heard what she described something that sounded like 'a herd of elephants.' 

'Just bum-rushed the entire theater,' she said. 

Lt. Paul Hopkins of the Orange County Sheriff's Office said officers quickly arrived on the scene.

'At that point, since we’re dealing with 800 to 900 juveniles, they called for assistance from surrounding agencies,' he said. 'We all formed together and were successfully able to get all these kids out of the mall area.'
