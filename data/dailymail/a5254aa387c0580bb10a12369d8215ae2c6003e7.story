When it comes to sex, no area of New York City sees more action than East Harlem, while a remote part of The Bronx seems to be going through a severe dry spell.

The matchmaking site HowAboutWe and its column The Date Report put together a handy map of New York City's neighborhoods whose dwellers enjoy knocking boots with many different lovers. 

Although the map based on data from the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey is supposed to show which parts of the Big Apple are having the most sex, a more accurate description of the project would be - which areas are the most promiscuous.

The dark-red areas on the chart indicate zones where residents have had three of more sexual partners in the past year.

Areas shaded in light pink show where New Yorkers are likely spending their nights in chaste solitude. 

People enjoying the busiest, or most philandering, sex lives reside in East Harlem, where nearly 20 per cent of the community reported multiple paramours in the past year.

Northeast Bronx, Washington Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and Flushing in Queens also showed a penchant for bed-hopping last year.

And it looks like the devastation of Superstorm Sandy did nothing to kill the mood for people who call the Rockaways their home.

Another hotbed of amorous activity was Northern State Island, but the rest of the borough did not rise to the occasion.

Last-place finish: Forest Hills in Queens, and East New York and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn did not do well in the sex department

Downtown Brooklyn, Upper West Side and Jamaica dwellers have proven themselves to be far less frisky than some of their neighbors, but even they did better in the lust department than their counterparts from East New York, Bay Ridge and Pelham.

Gothamist pointed out, however, that the map has one major flaw: it does not recognize people who have consistent sex with fewer partners.
