A grief-stricken family were forced to chase a thief who stole a hearse which contained the casket of their dead nephew.

The hearse was stolen from outside a Southern California church ahead of funeral service on Saturday.

The hearse was idling outside Ebenezer Baptist Church in South Los Angeles while the funeral director arranged flowers for 19-year-old Jonté Lee Reed's funeral, reports The Los Angeles Times.

The relatives of 19-year-old Jonté Lee Reed were horrified when they found out about the hearse being stolen

Shirley Little, the pastor's wife, says the director called ministry friends for help when he saw the hearse was missing.

Little says family members driving to the funeral had been notified and stopped the hearse four blocks from the church.

'When I got there, there's no hearse, there's no body,' Reed's aunt Johnnie Fortune told KTLA. 

'A lot of people went chasing after the car.'

The relatives forced the driver to pull over and battled with him both verbally and physically, according to KTLA.

The hearse was returned on a truck. 

The website reports that police detained the man, whose mental condition will be evaluated. 

He is to be charged with auto-theft.

Little says the hearse was returned and the funeral was only delayed by 30 minutes.
