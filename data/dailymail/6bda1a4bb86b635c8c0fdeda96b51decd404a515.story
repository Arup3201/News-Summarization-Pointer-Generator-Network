Republic of Congo ground out a surprise 1-0 win over Gabon at the African Cup of Nations on Wednesday to go top of Group A.

Prince Oniangue forced the ball in from a corner in the 48th minute at Bata Stadium to sneak the win after Republic of Congo was under pressure almost throughout and relied on counterattacks.

The Congolese were clinging on before and after their goal, but while Gabon surged forward often, they couldn't convert any of their many chances.

'We played a very good match tactically,' Republic of Congo coach Claude Le Roy said.

Levy Madinda sent a shot just past the post in Gabon's completely dominant first half. He also shot just wide late in the second after weaving his way past defenders to create the opening for himself.

Between those misses, Gabon's star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed an open goal and probably Gabon's best chance when the ball fell to him with Congo goalkeeper Christoffer Mafoumbi way out of position. Aubameyang somehow hit his low effort past the right post.

'With respect for Congo, it was not a fair result,' Gabon coach Jorge Costa said. 'We had a lot of chances to score.'

The result shook up Group A. Republic of Congo now leads with four points, Gabon has three and slipped down to second, host Equatorial Guinea has two points and Burkina Faso one.

Gabon and Equatorial Guinea - the neighbors who co-hosted the African Cup in 2012 - now meet in the crucial final round of group games.
