A college student has died after plummeting into a rocky pool during daredevil jumps with a group of friends.

Kevin La, 19, had been hiking with friends in the Angeles National Forest on Monday when the group of around 13 young people decided to go diving into a popular rock pool. 

Mr La, who attended California State Fullerton, jumped from a high rocky edge into the water and appeared to be unconscious when he came to the surface.

Mr La was airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

'He brought smiles to people who were going through tough times.'

Friends and family had set up a fundraising page to help pay for the teenager's funeral.
