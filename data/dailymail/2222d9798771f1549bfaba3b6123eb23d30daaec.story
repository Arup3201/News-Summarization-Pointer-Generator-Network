A former aide at a Cincinnati nursing home has been convicted of raping a 92-year-old resident who was confined to her bed and unable to communicate.

A judge on Monday found 22-year-old Samuel Onyenweaku guilty of the woman's November 24 rape at the Amber Park Nursing Home.

A prosecutor says the woman died in February from an unrelated condition.

A nursing supervisor testified against the young man, saying that she had tried to enter the resident's room, but the door was locked.

Sick: Samuel Onyenweaku, 22, of West Chester, Ohio was a nurse's aide at the Amber Park Nursing Home in Cincinnati when he was caught sexually assaulting a 92-year-old bed-ridden woman

When she finally opened it, she says she found the resident naked from the chest down.

Her night gown had been pushed up to her breasts.

A man's pants, underwear and shoes were lying under the bed.

The supervisor then tried to enter the woman's private bathroom, but that door was also locked.

She got in with a master key and found Onyenweaku.

The victim was a widow with no children.

A former school teacher in Kentucky, she was bed-ridden and could not communicate.

The rape occurred at the Amber Park  Amber Park Nursing Home in the 3800 block of E. Galbraith. The supervisor who caught Onyenweaku immediately called 911 and he was arrested

'This is terrible. She did know what was happening,' said Assistant Prosecutor Anita Vizedom.

'This was the end of her life.'

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that Onyenweaku was convicted of rape, felonious assault and patient abuse on Monday.

He could face 20 years in prison when he's sentenced on July 28.
