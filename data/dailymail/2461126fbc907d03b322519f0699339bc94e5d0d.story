New priority: Cambridge city councillor Sarah Brown wants to focus on Class A drugs

Cannabis use in parts of Cambridge is so rife that police should turn a blind eye to it, a local councillor has suggested.

Sarah Brown said the drug is ‘omnipresent’ in some areas of the historic university city.

And she wants police to stop targeting cannabis use and focus on more serious drugs.

She told a meeting of Cambridge City 
Council last week: ‘It’s pretty much impossible to walk more than 100 
metres in Petersfield and Romsey [areas popular with academics and 
students] without smelling it.

‘The wards are more or less awash 
with it.

'I wonder if it’s a good use of resources to go after this.

'It’s
more or less omnipresent.’

After the meeting she wrote on 
Twitter: ‘It seems obvious that public opinion on cannabis, at least in 
my ward, is at odds with the law.

'Resolving the disconnect is a national
issue.’

She added: ‘If you want a councillor 
who thinks the police should ruthlessly target recreational cannabis 
users, don’t vote for me.’

Sgt Colin Norden, from Cambridgeshire 
Constabulary, told the meeting his officers would challenge anyone 
spotted with the drug, but said his priority was Class A drugs. 

‘If we 
get reports in, particularly of dealing, we will deal with that,’ he 
added.

Cannabis is a class B drug, but thousands are given a written warning each year for possession.

Wasting time: Councillor Brown said some parts of Cambridge is so awash with cannabis, going after users may not be the best way to utilise police resources
