Speaker John Boehner has taken a shot at President Obama tonight as he gave an impression of his Democratic rival while on the House floor last night.

President Obama used a press conference on Monday evening to reiterate that he will not be having any conversations that tie the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to the annual budget.

Boehner jokingly echoed that sentiment on the House floor, saying: 'I talked to the President earlier tonight: I'm not going to negotiate. I'm not going to negotiate. I'm not going to negotiate.' 

'I didn't come here to shut down the government. The American people don't want a shutdown, and neither do I.'

Making fun: John Boehner lowered his voice and reiterated the words President Obama used hours earlier in a White House press conference

Last night was the first time that the Obama and Boehner spoke all week- a point that the Speaker's aides were eager to publicize, making a point that the President made time to have a landmark phone call with the President of Iran for the first time in more than three decades.

Boehner's press secretary Brendan Buck posted a photo of his boss on the phone with the President at around 8.30pm on Monday.

That phone call may have been too little too late as the midnight shutdown is seemingly inevitable.

Finally: The President spoke to Boehner for the first time all week on Monday evening, hours before the shutdown finally went into effect

President Obama has made it clear that he views the Republican House members as part of the problem as they are using the budget as a way to gut his health care agenda.

During his press conference on Monday, Obama gave a stern lecture slamming Republicans for trying to 'extract a ransom' at federal workers' expense.

'One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government doesn't get to shut down the entire government just to re-fight the results of an election,' he said.
