An 8-year-old girl testified in a New Jersey court Tuesday that a former Fox News reporter never touched her and that her babysitter forced her to lie about being molested.

Charles Leaf, 43, once a star investigative reporter of Fox 5 in New York, is standing trial four years after being arrested for sexual molestation of the girl, who is a member of his family.

The father-of-two is accused of sexually abusing her in his Wyckoff, New Jersey, home between December 2005 and 2006.

The girl is the first witness in Leaf’s 
sex assault trial, which opened Tuesday morning at Bergen County 
Courthouse, according to Cliffview Pilot.

In court: Former Fox reporter, Charles Leaf, 43, is standing trial for sexual molestation of an 8-year-old family member. The girl was the first witness in his trial which started Tuesday in New Jersey

Molestation charges: The father-of-two is accused of sexually abusing her in his Wyckoff, New Jersey, home when she was four years old

'Weronika told me to say those things,' she told the court according to the paper.

She also claimed that the babysitter threatened her brother and made the children clean the house top to bottom.

However, according to NorthJersey.com, prosecutors said the girl revealed in October 2010 that she had been touched by Leaf.

She had told her babysitter in detail 
that Leaf had touched her in her private parts and said Leaf told her 
not to tell anyone, according to prosecutors.

Star reporter: Leaf was once an investigative reporter for Fox 5, during which he won two Emmy Awards

In happier times: Leaf, 43, and his wife Monica, right. The couple have two children

The babysitter contacted a family friend who then contacted authorities. Leaf was arrested on October 7, 2010, after the girl told investigators during an interview that he engaged in sexual acts with her, the assistant prosecutor, Kenneth Ralph, said.

Monica Leaf, the child’s mother, went on
 TV three years ago, claiming Leaf had been set up by the nanny, who 
also is expected to testify.

She said the nanny got the girl to lie about being molested, according to the video published on CBS News.

Betrayal: Leaf, shown here with his family, was portrayed as a man who 'shattered the American dream' with 'a dark secret, a stain on the image of a perfect family', according by prosecutors

Arrested: Leaf's wife said the nanny got the girl to lie about being digitally penetrated and seeing him masturbate in front of her several times. He was arrested four years ago

Leaf’s wife also said he passed a polygraph test, which is inadmissible in court.

A videotaped forensic interview of the girl by a child sex crimes specialist will be shown during day two of the trial on Wednesday.

Leaf's sister, Susan Gaudet, made shocking claims in 2010 that he had molested young girls before.

She told the New York Daily News at the time that her younger brother abused two of his relatives in the 1980s.

'I'd
 like to see them put him away for the rest of his life,' said Gaudet, 
one of Leaf's three sisters, from Jacksonville, North Carolina.

'I am so
 full of rage. If I had the opportunity to spit in his face and hurt 
him, I would do it.'

After his arrest, investigators seized his 
computer and discovered that he kept images of child pornography, Ralph 
said, according to NorthJersey.com.

Detectives also found that 
shortly before the computer was seized, Leaf had conducted a 'system 
restore' to erase data from the hard-disk.

Tough journalist: The former reporter was a TV personality on Fox 5

Leaf, who turns 44 next week, is charged with aggravated sexual assault, child endangerment and possession of child pornography, according to NorthJersey.com.

He also is charged with one count of witness tampering and one count of tampering with evidence, based on the allegations that he told the girl to keep quiet and tried to destroy evidence from his computer.

He has been freed on $270,000 bail after spending seven weeks in jail and has been working as paralegal while in jail, according to Cliffview Pilot.
