In between partying at Coachella with BFF Cara Delevingne and caring for her four-year-old son, Riley, British model Jourdan Dunn has managed to squeeze in a high-end beauty campaign, too.

The six foot clothes horse, who has been dubbed the modern-day Naomi Campbell, has been unveiled as the new face of Maybelline New York.

Jourdan will be joining an elite group of Maybelline models, which includes Christy Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King, who was recently announced as the face of the brand's latest foundation.

Maybe she was born with it! Jourdan Dunn has added beauty modelling to her CV as the new face of Maybelline New York

'Jourdan’s look, style and positive energy are perfect for the brand,' said a spokesperson. 'She truly reflects Maybelline’s vision of global beauty.'

Jourdan, 23, who was first discovered by a model scout while out with friends at Primark and made her runway debut during the 2007 Fall New York Fashion Week, said of her new signing: 'It is an honor to be a spokesperson for
 such an iconic brand.

'I am proud to say that I am a 
Maybelline girl and hopefully I can make people feel the same way I did 
when I saw the advertisements growing up. The brand imagery is always 
beautiful and positive. To now be a part of that is a dream come true!'.

As a British Vogue regular, who has worked for the likes of DKNY and Burberry, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career.

She works hard...and plays hard! Jourdan was recently partying at Coachella and got straight back to work this week shooting for her upcoming fashion campaigns

Speaking at the Vogue 
Festival last month, Jourdan opened up about her insecurities growing 
up: 'I was very tall and lanky and I wasn't really feeling myself when I
 was growing up at all.

'Especially because, coming from a 
Caribbean background, curves are celebrated and me being really tall and
skinny wouldn't [be]. So I was like... didn't want to go out or be seen
or anything.'

She even admitted to running up 
'crazy' phone bills when she first moved to New York for work aged 16, 
because she missed her family so much: 'Every minute I was on the phone 
to my mum crying, complaining, more crying and more complaining.'

When she is not modeling, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. 

This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.

In addition to being a mother and philanthropist, Jourdan is a self-taught cook and hosts a lifestyle and cooking program titled 'Well Dunn with Jourdan Dunn.'

Stellar career: Jourdan was first discovered by a model scout while out with friends and has since walked for Topshop Unique (left) and Victoria's Secret (right)
