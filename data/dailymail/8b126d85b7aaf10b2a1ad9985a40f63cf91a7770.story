The Prime Minister said there was positive economic news on both employment and take-home pay

The recovery is bearing fruit for ordinary families, David Cameron said last night, as official analysis showed wages rose faster than inflation for 90 per cent of people last year.

The Prime Minister said there was positive economic news on both employment and take-home pay.

Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney reassured mortgage-holders that there is no immediate need to increase interest rates.

Government analysis of Office for National Statistics data found working families’ pay rose a third faster than inflation in the year to April 2013. 

The bottom half of earners did best, with take-home pay rising three-quarters faster than the CPI rate of inflation.

The bottom 90 per cent saw take-home pay rise faster than inflation, but for the richest 10 per cent, it fell in real terms.

The analysis is likely to attract charges of complacency from Labour, who say vulnerable families are disproportionately hit by rising energy bills and high food prices.

Ministers argue low interest rates and an increase in the amount that can be earned tax-free, to £10,000, have helped to shield working people.

The tax-free allowance rose from £8,105 in 2012-13 to £9,440 in 2013-14, taking 1.2million earners out of income tax. It is due to rise to £10,000 in April.

The Prime Minister, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said there were signs living standards were finally improving. 

He said: ‘We saw this week the largest increase in employment in one quarter since records began – 1.3million more people in work than when I became Prime Minister.

'Not only have we got more jobs but we’re also cutting taxes, so we are seeing some positive signs in terms of take-home pay. But it’s going to take time and we need to be patient.’ 

Mr Cameron said the UK must deal with ‘problems that we had before the recovery’ such as the deficit and the banking system. He said that Britain must ‘rebalance our economy and make sure it’s a recovery for all, north and south, for manufacturing as well as services, to make  sure the poorest people in our country benefit’.

Mr Carney, also in Davos, told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘Inflation’s back on target – 300,000 jobs, private sector, created in the last quarter measured. 

‘One of the strongest-growing, at the moment, economies in the advanced world. It feels pretty good from where I sit.’ He said the case for an interest rate rise would be examined in next month’s inflation report.On Wednesday, the jobless rate fell to 7.1 per cent, close to Mr Carney’s 7 per cent target for a rise. But he said he would look at the whole labour market, not one indicator, and any rise would be ‘very gradual’.

The base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. 

Business and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘As a consequence of the Great Recession, people who work hard have been made poorer.

‘That’s why, as part of our long-term economic plan, we are cutting taxes for hardworking people . . . Last year, our tax cuts meant people’s take-home pay rose faster than prices.’
