A diabetic teenager has been refused entry to a New Jersey Drive-In movie theater because he was carrying food necessary for his condition.

Ben Weidner, 16, has Type 1 diabetes and carries insulin, an Epipen, a juicebox and some candy with him everywhere he goes to manage his blood sugar levels.

Owner of the Delsea Drive-In John DeLeonardis - who 
also happens to be a pediatrician -Â  says that his business has a strict
 policy against outside food and drink.

Entry refused: Ben Weidner, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, was refused entry to Delsea Drive-In because he was carrying a juice-box and some candy for his condition

Weidner was refused entry to the Vineland cinema, where his father had taken him and his friends for a fun 
night at the movies, because of the food items in his backpack.

'No food. No drink. Bottom line,' Dr DeLeonardis told WPVI. 'Sorry your kid has an affliction but what can I tell you?'

Ben's father Phil Weidner says DeLeonardis went too far in enforcing the rule with his son.

'He needs to have items with him to handle low blood sugar. He's got celiac, he's got numerous food allergies. We are bringing these items in not because they are extra items to eat, but because they are for his own safety,' he told WPVI.

Doctor's orders: Dr John DeLeonardis is a pediatrician and the owner of Delsea Drive-In and says that he won't change his rule to allow diabetics to bring in outside snacks because he'll lose money at the concession stand

Necessary supplies: Ben Weidner carries this backpack with him everywhere. It hold his Epipen, insulin, candy and a juice-box

DeLeonardis is unrepentant and says that he'll miss out on sales at the concession stand if he changes his policy.

'They'll abuse it,' he told WPVI . 'My time shouldn't be occupied at the box office trying to explain to people, "We have a website. It tells you about this." If you don't want to go to that, don't come.'

He says food, including gluten-free snacks, is available at his concession stand and that there's no need for anyone to bring anything else with them.

However, for a person suffering a sudden drop in blood-sugar levels, even a short wait in line at a concession stand could spell disaster.

Ben Weidner, who already has to worry about his condition daily and inject himself with insulin, the abortive trip to the movies left a bad taste in his mouth.

'I feel humiliated, really,' he told WPVI. 'Because I've been trying to get past this, all this stuff with my friends. Pretty much being with them, be as normal as possible. It's just really humiliating.'
