A married former Washington Post vice president has been found dead in a gay bar in Manhattan with drug paraphernalia near his body.

Guyon Knight was found dead around 8am on Saturday in a bar called the Out in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.

The New York Post reported the circumstances of the 64-year-old's death, saying that he was seen with a needle, a pipe and unspecified pills near his body.

Scene: Guyon Knight was reportedly found on the floor outside of a room where a party was being held at 8am on Saturday morning at The Out hotel in Hell's Kitchen

Knight was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital but doctor's could not save him.

Calls to the medical examiner about the formal cause of death were not immediately returned.

He leaves behind his wife Linda and his grown son.

Knight was previously based in Washington D.C. when he worked as a vice president for the national newspaper but left the company in 2007 to work for Bellor Knight, a communications firm in Virginia.

The New York Post reports that Knight and his wife live in a high rise apartment overlooking Central Park on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

Former workplace: Knight worked at The Washington Post starting in 1982 and progressing to the role of vice president by the time he left the company in 2007

The club where Knight was found describes itself as being gay-but-straight friendly, but a person familiar with the bar told MailOnline that it is mostly frequented by gay patrons.

'It would be pretty darn strange to see and old straight guy partying in there,' the source said.

The 42nd Street location, where Mr Knight was found at around 8am on Saturday, has a bar, a spa and hotel rooms.

Calls to Out NYC's press representatives were not immediately returned.
