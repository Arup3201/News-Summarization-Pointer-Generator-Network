The elaborate rooftop mountain mansion in Beijing has been filmed from above, showing the big villa, the pool and impressive rock garden as it is announced it must be destroyed.

The 8,610-square foot structure, built illegally, has been ordered to be demolished and must be removed within 15 days.

As the video of the impressive villa went viral, the owner, a professor Zhang Biqing, began to take his home apart.

The aerial video, posted on Chinese microblog Sina Weibo, was filmed with a home-made drone and an DSLR camera.

Shortly afterwards it was posted to Yoku, a Chinese YouTube, and racked up more than 500,000 views within 12 hours.

The rooftop home, which never received planning approval, has caused cracks to appear in his neighbours' ceilings and walls while some have had to put up with leaks from broken pipes and drains.

They have also been forced to live with the noise and disturbance caused from the building work.

One resident said their apartment is constantly flooded while another described the academic as a 'menace'.Â

Going down: The owner has been ordered to destroy the rooftop mansion after neighbours protested against the illegal home

'This was originally a small attic when he bought it. But he tore that down and built this mountain on top of us,' said one.

'He's broken drains so we're always being flooded when it rains and there are huge structural cracks in our ceiling and walls,' they added.

'He is a menace as a neighbour and he didn't get any permission to build this monstrosity,' said another.

Neighbours will yet again have to suffer building noise as the dismantling began today.

A protective fence be set up around the building so falling objects would not hit passing pedestrians and vehicles.

Destruction: The owner has 15 days to complete the demolition of the illegal building

Reports this week drew wide attention to the huge house among what looked like a pile of rocks dotted with trees on top of the apartment building.

Neighbours had reportedly complained about the villa, saying they feared it could collapse on top of them.

The rocks, said to be imitation shells rather than solid stone, have trees and bushes growing among them, as in classical Chinese landscape painting.

Poking out from between them, sections of the villa underneath can be seen -- a blue-framed window here, a balcony under a curved roof there.
