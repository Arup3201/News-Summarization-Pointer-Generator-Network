A nurse who works an Atlanta hospital stepped in to assist an eight-year-old girl and her mother running a 5K race over the weekend.

A photo of nurse Gary Harris next to Marjan Holbrook and her daughter Rebecca was uploaded to Facebook by Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

The caption for the Tuesday post read: 'Marjan and her daughter, Rebecca, who has mitochondrial disease signed up to run the Publix 5[K] with the Kyle Pease Foundation Team.

'Heavy rain at the starting line almost kept them from participating, but nurse Gary, who they had met in the hospital a few weeks earlier, spotted them and their predicament. 

All smiles: Nurse Gary Harris, left, assisted Marjan Holbrook by pushing her 8-year-old daughter Rebecca's stroller. The three finished a 5K in 27 minutes 

Care: Harris earlier was a nurse for 8-year-old Rebecca, who has mitochondrial disease, at an Atlanta hospital. The girl's mother, Marjan Holbrook, is seen right in the Publix Georgia 5K

'So, the man who had cared for Rebecca offered to push her through the tough course so mom could run alongside them.

'In the end, not only did all three successfully complete the race, Rebecca and Gary finished first in their division!

The 5K race is part of the Publix Georgia Marathon and Half Marathon.  

WSB-TV, which first reported on the story and Facebook post, said rainy and chilly weather can irritate Marjan Holbrook's asthma.

Under cold weather, seizures often hit eight-year-old Rebecca, the television station reported.

Marjan Holbrook recalled the Sunday events to WSB-TV, saying 'I was about to call [my husband as he was parking] and say "Don’t bother, I’m not going to run." It was getting stressful.' 

According to MitoAction, 'Mitochondrial disease is a chronic, genetic disorder that occurs when the mitochondria of the cell fail to produce enough energy for cell or organ function.'

No cure exists for the disease, which can get worse over time, according to the organization.

Some of the symptoms include muscle weakness, seizures, having autism or being on the spectrum, as well as learning disabilities and developmental delays, the group says.

Health concerns: Marjan Holbrook and Rebecca were going to opt out of the race before Harris offered to help them, since cold weather can irritate Marjan's asthma and her daughter can get seizures in chilly temperatures

Endurance: Nurse Gary Harris, seen left with Rebecca Holbrook, has said he celebrated finishing the 5K before running to his wife's spot in the half marathon so they could finish at the same time

Marjan Holbrook told WSB-TV  that while at tent for theKyle Pease Foundation '[Gary] came over and said hi and I said, "Gary, it’s good to see you, but I don’t think we’re going to be running this morning."'

The television station reported that Harris then volunteered his assistance before the group went on to run the 5K in 27 minutes.

Marjan Holbrook told the  station 'I’m inspired by Gary because he wasn't supposed to be there. He hadn't trained, but he just showed up and did it.'

Harris told WSB-TV that he and his wife annually participate in the Publix Georgia Half Marathon.

He told the television station he celebrated finishing the 5K before running to his wife's spot in the half marathon so they could finish at the same time.

'I’ve seen at [Rebecca] worst and seen her at her best, and knowing I’ve helped facilitate her being at her best is the best feeling as a nurse,' he told WSB-TV.
