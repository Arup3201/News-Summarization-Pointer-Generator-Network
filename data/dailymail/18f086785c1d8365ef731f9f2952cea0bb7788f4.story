Threesome: Graham Allen Robertson admitted downloading indecent images of his ex-girlfriend onto CDs and putting them in envelopes addressed to her family and colleagues but denied mailing them

A 62-year-old male witch has avoided jail after photos of him having a threesome with his 30-year-old girlfriend and an unnamed man were mailed to her mother and work colleagues.

Graham Allen Robertson was devastated at the end of his brief relationship with the woman after she began an affair with a separate man.

In what was described as a cathartic ritual, he downloaded 51 of the indecent images onto 13 separate DVDs and labelled them with her name and the words 'The Shetland Dogger'.

The discs were then sent to addresses in her home town of Lerwick, including the Shetland Islands Town Hall where she worked, numerous pubs and hotels, a taxi firm, hairdressers and the local boating club.

But despite Mr Robertson admitting he had carefully packaged the discs in envelopes, he said he had never intended to send them and they were posted by a friend who had found them in his home in Glastonbury, Somerset.

Mr Robertson, who describes himself as 'a witch', had several sexual encounters with the 30-year-old when she visited Glastonbury for a family holiday in October 2011, Somerset Magistrates heard.

Prosecutor Simon Cooper said: 'They arranged to meet again and it was agreed Robertson would bring along a male friend to take part in consensual sexual activity with the woman and himself.

'While that was taking place, photographs of a sexually explicit nature were taken and she was aware of this.'

Following the holiday she returned home and continued to contact Mr Robertson by phone and text messages.

After another visit to Somerset six weeks later, he sent her a number of Christmas presents to her home, along with gifts for members of her family.

Robertson then discovered she had started a relationship with another man from the Glastonbury area and as a result their relationship came to an end.

He asked her to return the gifts he had sent her which she did apart from one, and it was after then that he downloaded 51 of the photographs onto discs.

One by one the discs started to be received by businesses and individuals on the Shetland Islands, including the victim's own mother.

Mr Cooper said: 'Several of the individuals contacted the police and when police searched Robertson's home address he handed over four similar discs with the same labelling.

Significant: Mr Robertson describes himself as 'a witch' and said he chose to prepare 13 discs as the number has a special significance for him - but he maintains they were posted by a friend who found them in his hall

'When he was interviewed he said he had become obsessed with the woman and the breakdown in their relationship had affected him very badly.'

However, Mr Robertson told the court that despite previously saying that he had sent the discs, he had lied during his police interview to protect his new partner.

He said he had suspected she sent them as he claimed she hated the victim after seeing the emotional breakdown he had suffered following their split.

It was not until the autumn of 2012 that another woman, Julie Raybould, confessed that she had bought stamps and posted them on his behalf after finding them in the hallway of his home, saying she assumed he had intended to send them.

Mr Robertson said he had prepared 13 discs and the number 13 was of great significance to him.

'I am a witch and I do things completely differently,' he said. 'They were not for sending but it was a symbolic thing I was doing.

Not guilty: Mr Robertson was cleared by the court of sending offensive communications because the prosecution could not prove he posted the discs

'I had a complete breakdown after the relationship ended and lost three stone in weight and was feeling very stressed.

'Downloading the photos onto discs was my way of dealing with this and I did a lot of research on the internet and found names and addresses of individuals and businesses and put the discs into envelopes but then put them away.

'I put all my frustrations and anger into it and that was my way of dealing with it, but they were never ever meant to be sent.'

Mr Robertson's friend Ms Raybould, also from Glastonbury, said that she had found a large number of envelopes in Robertson's hallway and had taken them to a post office where she weighed them, bought stamps and then posted them to the various addresses not realising what they contained.

In a written statement the victim explained that Mr Robertson had discovered her affair with the other man after she was tricked into accepting a friend request he had sent to her on Facebook while posing as a female.Â 

The police in Lerwick then contacted her saying that various people and businesses had started receiving the discs containing the explicit images.

She said: 'He was bitter about me breaking contact with him and when I learned about the images he had sent I was shocked and felt physically sick.'

Mr Robertson, of Manor Close, Glastonbury, denied 11 counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature between March 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012 when he appeared before Somerset Magistrates sitting at Yeovil on Tuesday.

He was found not guilty after chairman of the Bench Christopher Thomas-Peter said it had not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Mr Robertson was the person who had sent the discs.
