As Sony and Microsoft gear up to do battle next month when they both begin selling their new consoles to gamers, early polls suggest the PlayStation may be the must-have gadget.

Research carried out by Reuters and Ipsos found 26 per cent of shoppers said they are likely to buy Sony's new console when it goes on sale, compared to 15 per cent who said they'd prefer the Xbox One. 

The rest of the participants said they have no plans to buy a console before the end of the year.

Around a quarter of the Reuters/Ipsos poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto 
V when the new consoles come out.

While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision 
Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game.

Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag came in third 
place in the poll at 19 per cent.

Electronic Arts' Madden NFL 25 and Battlefield 4 were the participants' 
fourth and fifth choices.

A total of 1,297 were surveyed online about their interest in 'dedicated game devices' over the period of 23 to the 27 September.

Almost a third (31 per cent) of this group were aged 40 or under and of this section, 41 per cent said they planned to buy the PS4, whereas the Xbox One got 27 per cent of the votes.

Reuters highlights the fact the poll uses a limited sample, yet said: 'The results potentially point to a lopsided battle during the crucial holiday season, with Microsoft and Sony hoping to get their newest consoles into U.S. households.

Apart from games, they act as conduits for living-room entertainment, from TV shows to music.'

Commenting on why they are making their decisions, 26-year-old gamer Christopher Turner from Alabama said: Microsoft couldn't make up their mind and Sony hadn't wavered from the 
beginning. 'The PlayStation 4 is
for both hardcore and casual gamers.'

Turner is referring to Microsoft's initial decision to set restrictions on second-hand games and policies about the consoles internet connection. However, the company reversed this decision in June and clarified some of the confusion.

Jon Leigh, 56, from Kentucky believes this Microsoft controversy won't 
sway Xbox fans, though: 'People who use Microsoft products will continue 
to use them.'

He added he will be buying the Xbox One because of the new Kinect motion sensor, shipped as standard with all new consoles, and because he's more familiar with the
Xbox than the PlayStation.

Sony's PS4 will cost $399 in the U.S (£349 in the UK) while Microsoft's Xbox One is more expensive at $499 (£429). However, this extra price factors in the new Kinect device. 

Sony announced it has received more than 1 million pre-orders for its PS4, while Microsoft has revealed only that pre-orders for the Xbox One exceeded those of its predecessor, the Xbox 360, eight years ago.

The PS4 was announced in February and will go on sale in the United 
States and Canada on 15 November, and Europe on 29 November.

The Xbox One was unveiled in May and will 
be available on 22 November in 13 countries, including the U.S and UK.
