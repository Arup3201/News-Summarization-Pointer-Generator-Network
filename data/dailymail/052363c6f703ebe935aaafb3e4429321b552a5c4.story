After dramatically admitting snorting cocaine and cannabis, Nigella Lawson tried to put her court ordeal behind her by going out for dinner last night with Sir Salman Rushdie.

The TV cook, 53, was seen dining with the 66-year-old Satanic Verses author in a £70-a-head Indian restaurant in Mayfair, central London, last night.

Miss Lawson confessed in court last week to taking drugs after being subjected to 'intimate terrorism' by her ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

During two harrowing days giving evidence at Isleworth Crown Court, the mother-of-two protested 'I have been put on trial here' as she was repeatedly questioned about taking cocaine.

She was giving evidence against her former personal assistants Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo who are accused of carrying out a £685,000 credit card fraud.

But after being released from the witness stand by Judge Robin Johnson last Thursday evening, Miss Lawson has tried to put her crown court ordeal behind her.

She was seen eating at Gymkhana Indian restaurant, in Mayfair, with Sir Salman, just half a mile away from Scott's restaurant where she was infamously photographed being 'throttled' by her ex-husband earlier this year.

Miss Lawson and Sir Salman have been friends since the 1990s when she was married to her first husband John Diamond.

Mr Saatchi - who told the court he still 'adores' Nigella - was today seen out in central London buying a copy of Private Eye magazine.

While giving evidence in court Miss Lawson admitted snorting cocaine six times with Mr Diamond while he was terminally ill, starting in 1999.

She also admitted taking the drug once while married to Charles Saatchi as well as smoking cannabis. However, she denied being an addict.

Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo deny the credit card fraud and the case against them continues.
