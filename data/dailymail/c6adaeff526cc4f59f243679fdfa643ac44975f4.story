 

Sam Burgess has spoken of his sadness at missing the 2014 Four Nations Series but still hopes to have an influence on the England team as they prepare to take on Samoa.

The newly-crowned Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) player of the year presented the England shirts to new caps Joe Westerman, Matty Smith, Josh Hodgson and Daryl Clark on their arrival in Brisbane to prepare for Saturday's opening fixture at the Suncorp Stadium.

Burgess is nursing a fractured eye socket and cheekbone, sustained in the opening moments of his man-of-the-match performance for South Sydney in this month's NRL Grand Final, but was already ruled out of England's Four Nations campaign after signing a three-year contract with Bath.

He will be unveiled by the Aviva Premiership club next week but was described as 'emotional' when he addressed the England squad on Thursday, shortly after becoming the first English winner of the RLIF award.

'He presented me with my shirt, which was a big honour for me,' said Hull loose forward Westerman via a conference call from Brisbane. 'Growing up, I played against him.

'He has always been an awesome player but to do what he did in the Grand Final and pretty much all his career, it was amazing, it was a real proud moment for me.

'He gave a lot of advice to the group and everybody took it on board. It was a bit emotional for him, he wishes he was out there playing with us.'

Westerman, who at 24 is a year younger than the former Bradford forward, will make his England debut in place of injured skipper Sean O'Loughlin, his room-mate during England's week-long camp at the Sanctuary Cove Golf and Country Club on Queensland's Gold Coast.

He was chosen by head coach Steve McNamara as a straight replacement for the newly-appointed skipper, who is expected to be fit for England's next match against Australia in Melbourne on Sunday week, but Westerman is determined not to give up the shirt without a fight.

'It's been really good rooming with Lockers,' said the former Castleford forward. 'He's a real professional and a great player, someone I've always looked up to.

'I play a lot similar to how he plays. I've got my opportunity this week and I'll do what I can. Hopefully I will do well enough to get a place next week.

'Lockers is captain of the squad and one of the best loose forwards in the world but, if I play well and do all I can, then it's down to Steve depending on the squad he wants to pick.'

Westerman, who played the best rugby of his career in 2014, is the only representative from Hull FC in the England squad but he will be reunited on Saturday with former team-mates Michael Shenton, Daryl Clark and Brett Ferres.

'I played with Shenny and Daryl at Cas and Brett as well,' he said. 'It will be good to pull a shirt on with them again.

'I was over the moon when I got picked in the initial squad and the next step was actually getting a game. To get picked to start is a dream come true and I've got to go out there and make the most of it.

'I'm looking forward to how it will feel in the stadium. I can see it being emotional but it will be a good day, especially for my family. It will be a very proud day.'
