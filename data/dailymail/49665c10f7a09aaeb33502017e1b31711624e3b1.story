A cruise company has said it was surprised and disappointed after one of its vessels was turned away by the Falkland Islands government.

The Star Princess ship, owned by Princess Cruises, had planned to dock in Port Stanley on a cruise from Chile to Brazil, with several stops in Argentina.

Falklands government spokesman Darren Christie said they had to deny the vessel entry because several of the passengers had stomach flu and the islands were ill-equipped to handle a contagious virus.

Shut out: The Star Princess cruise liner, which holds 3,500 passengers - many of them Argentine - was turned away from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands because many onboard had a stomach bug

Dispute: The cruise liner was barred from docking at Port Stanley, where the authorities said the island could not cope with an outbreak of illness

But there will be suspicions that the decision was a political one as Argentina and Britain continue to engage in a diplomatic row over the island the South American country calls Las Malvinas.

Many Argentines were among the 3,500 passengers and crew onboard the cruise liner as it was forced to continue on to Argentina.

Princess Cruises said the decision was unwarranted and unscientific and runs against international health policy.

It comes one month after members of the Mercosur trading bloc, which includes Argentina, announced it would bar military vessels flying the Falkland Islands emblem from docking in ports.

Uruguayan president Jose Mujica announced the decision, which covers ports in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, but then claimed it was motivated by economic factors.

Tensions between Argentina and Britain have been raised after months of posturing over the Atlantic Ocean islands.

The South American country intensified its campaign of intimidation against fishing boats operating with UK licences and last month, Spanish vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops.

Earlier this month it told its 
fishermen to catch Illex squid, a rare delicacy in the Far East, before 
they reach the waters around the British territory.

The
move was designed to deal a damaging blow to the islands' booming 
Â£90million economy - half of which relies on its fishing industry.

The row reared its head again in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands.

Argentina has always claimed the islands should belong to it, despite the fact they were claimed by Britain in the 1830s - before modern Argentina was technically founded.

Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016.

Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers.

In 1982, Argentina's junta invaded the islands. Then prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent a task force including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an invasion force to retake the territory.

A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons as the Falklands were successfully defended.

Concerns have been raised, however, that defence cuts last year could leave the territory vulnerable to another attack by Argentina.
