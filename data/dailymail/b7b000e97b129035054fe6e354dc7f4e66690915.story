Police officers shot a Florida man who threatened to kill himself, his roommates and any police officers who showed up at his house near Fort Lauderdale.

The shooting happened Sunday afternoon in Wilton Manors and the dead man has been identified as 50-year-old Thomas Carberry.

The Broward Sheriff's Office has taken over the investigation and the two Wilton Manors police officers have been placed on administrative leave. 

Armed: Thomas Carberry can be seen holding a gun in his right hand in this shot taken by a photographer for The Sun-Sentinel on Sunday afternoon

Deadly: Carberry reportedly told police during the tense standoff, 'Just do it, man. Just do it' 

Fallen: Carberry is shot by a police officer 

Tense: Carberry's roommate David Dlouhy has said Carberry was addicted to drugs and suicidal 

Authorities say Carberry's roommates, who have been identified by local media as David Dlouhy and Terry Cooley, notified police after he threatened them.

When the man went outside the house, the roommates locked the door.

Dlouhy told The Sun-Sentinel Carberry had attempted suicide before and was addicted to drugs.

'When he walked out of here, he wanted to be killed,' Dlouhy told the newspaper. 'He hated how drugs had taken over his life.' 

Carberry had hepatitis C and without a job, the newspaper reported.

Dlouhy and Cooley told dispatchers Carberry was trying to get back in and that he had started firing his gun.

Cooley, Dlouhy's partner, told The Sun-Sentinel 'I was telling the dispatcher, "Get the police here faster. He's coming through the door."'

'We wanted to show him what a normal, middle-class life looked like,' Dlouhy told the newspaper. 'But ultimately, he wanted to be killed. He wanted out of this endless catastrophe.'

Officers arrived on the scene and found Carberry outside the home, clutching a gun in his right hand.

Tragic outcome: Carberry had reportedly threatened to kill his roommates David Dlouhy and Terry Cooley and take his own life before he was shot dead by police

Tragic: Authorities say Carberry was shot after police told him multiple times to drop his gun 

Joe Cavaretta, a photographer with The Sun-Sentinel, told NBC what he saw.

'He's got a gun in his hand, holding it done. And the police, it must have been three or four times, "Drop your weapon, drop your weapon, drop your weapon." And the guy said, he said, "Just do it, man. Just do it."' 

Neighbor Margrit Campbell told the Sun-Sentinel Carberry 'stood there with a silly grin on his face.' 

Officers ordered Carberry to drop the gun. He refused and officers opened fire.

Carberry was rushed to a Broward hospital and later died.
