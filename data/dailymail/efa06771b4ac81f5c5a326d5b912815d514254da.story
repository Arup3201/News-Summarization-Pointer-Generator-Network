At a time of national wage stagnation and economic uncertainty outside the beltway, a Virginia Democratic congressman wants a raise – arguing that a $174,000 salary isn't enough for a federal legislator to live comfortably in or around Washington, D.C.

'I think the American people should know that the members of Congress are underpaid,' Moran told Roll Call.

'I understand that it’s widely felt that they underperform, but the fact is that this is the board of directors for the largest economic entity in the world.'

Congress' approval rating among voters typically hovers under 20 per cent.

Rep. Jim Moran, a 23-year incumbent, is set to retire next year but wants to leave congressional salaries on the upswing when he departs

As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran participated in a subcommittee's legislative 'markup' session Thursday that will affect how much money the Treasury sets aside for congressional salaries.

Overall, the House aims to set aside a whopping $3.3 billion to run its operations, including expenses for Member and staff salaries, constituent support services and operating office buildings near the Capitol.

Republicans on the committee want Moran's pay – and their own – to remain at the level where they've been held since a austerity freeze took effect in 2010.

Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, insisted that there would be no salary bump in the House of Representatives.

'The House will continue to lead by example and hold the line on spending,' he said Thursday.

A Republican aide to an appropriations Committee member told MailOnline that Moran's request is out of line with reality.

'This is how the Democrats work,' he said. 'They come to town and all of a sudden feel entitled to spend more and more taxpayer dollars, even on themselves. If anything, members should be cutting their salaries until the unemployment picture in the rest of America improves. Don't you think?'

Moran whined to Roll Call that 'our pay has been frozen for three years and we’re planning on freezing it a fourth year. … A lot of members can’t even afford to live decently in Washington.'

He said his proposal for bigger paychecks probably won't gain any traction in committee – 'this is wholly quixotic,' he admitted – but added that he might raise the issue on the House floor in order to start a broader discussion.

Shutdown couture: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (L) wore a pricey Hermes scarf on television in October, while arguing against a looking partial government shutdown

Moran is retiring next year after 12 terms in Washington, a job he won after serving as the mayor of Alexandria, Virginia.

He describes himself as the poorest member of Congress.

A 2010 divorce left Moran virtually penniless after several previous years' financial disclosures showed he had millions banked – $12.7 million, in fact, as recently as 2007, according to a Washington Post database..

Some of his colleagues, however, have managed to squeak by on their modest $174,000 salaries.

House Speaker John Boehner shares a basement apartment with a roommate when he's not in his southern Ohio district, for example.

Others, though, haev managed to become wealthy while listing public services as their official careers.

Nancy Pelosi, the one-time House speaker who is now Democrats' minority leader, is part of America's financial '1 per cent.'

Her financial disclosure form filed last year shows assets worth at least $38 million. Due to the form's vague categories, those assets could be worth as much as $178 million.

In 1995 when she filed her first congressional disclosure, she listed assets worth about half as much.

Pelosi's 'shutdown couture' raised national eyebrows in October when she sported a designer Hermes scarf worth nearly $1,000 while arguing that the federal government couldn't afford to close down while Congress debated the 2014 federal budget.

Originally, serving in Congress was a part-time avocation for farmers, ranchers, lawyers and homesteaders who spent most of their time at home and collected $6 per day for their service.

Today the suburbs around the nation's capital are home to America's wealthiest ZIP codes and hold the distinction of being one of the few places where unemployment rates are declining.

Congressman Jim Moran, a Virginia Democrat, thinks federal legislators are underpaid

@highlight

Zip codes around Washington, D.C. have the nation's highest average household incomes, and housing prices have tracks along with salaries

With many Americans struggling to make ends meet and U.S. employment participation rate at a 20-year low, a pay raise request sounds callous
