Julann Roe says she doesn't like tax increases or paying for other people's retirement so she paid her tax pill in singles out of protest

A Libertarian and outspoken critic of her Florida county's government paid her $11,075.44 tax bill in dollar bills, plus 44 pennies, in protest of an employee pay increase.

Julann Roe brought the stash of cash to the county office complex on Monday. Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano says it took several employees more than an hour to count and verify it.

‘I was wondering how she got that many dollar bills,’ Fasano said. ‘I doubt any bank would have that many singles on hand.'

Fasano didn't fault her math, though.

'It was correct, he said. 'Down to the penny.'

Roe's
41-acre estate in Dade City is valued at $711,447. It includes a 
4,014-square-foot home with a covered pool, Jacuzzi and outdoor 
fireplace. 

There is also a detached garage and horse stables worth $118,300, according to the Tampa Tribune.

Roe
has attended multiple public hearings this year to speak against the 
budget, which saw employee pay raises for the first time in five years.

To the penny: Pasco County tax collector Mike Fasano says it took his office an hour to count out Roe's 11,075 dollar bills and forty four pennies

‘I do not feel obligated to pay for any wage increase for any county employee,’ she said at a September meeting.

Roe,
whose family owns an insurance company, said she shouldn’t have to pay 
to take care of the employees after they reach retirement age.

‘I do not feel obligated to pay for your retirement, either. Save your own money for your own retirement,’ she said.

Dolla' bills, ya'll: 'I was wondering how she got that many dollar bills, 'Fasano quipped. 'I doubt any bank would have that many singles on hand'

'I do not feel obligated to pay for any wage increase for any county employee': Roe was protesting a recent 3 percent pay increase for all employees in Pasco County, including those at this government office. It was their first in over 5 years

She also opposed a since-defeated gas tax increase.

‘The public is not your slush fund,’ she continued. ‘Stay within your means because we don’t want anymore taxes.’

Fasano said Roe’s visit to the tax collector was anything but typical but was quick to point out that, thanks to tax dollars, his office was there to serve her.

‘We’re here to serve anyone who comes into our office,’ he said. ‘We’ve had people pay in cash before, but to have a property tax bill over $11,000 is not average.’
