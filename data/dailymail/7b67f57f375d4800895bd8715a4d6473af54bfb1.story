Arsenal will check on the availability of Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema after the Champions League final.

The France international has been coveted by Wenger for years, with the Gunners having failed with moves for the forward in the last two summers.

And Arsenal are ready to make another move for Benzema this summer as the club targets a bone-fide world class striker ahead of next season.

On the move? Benzema has just 12 months left on his contract with Champions League finalists Real

Target: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has failed with bids for Benzema in the last two summer transfer windows

Benzema has 12 months left on his contract leaving him in a strong position to either re-negotiate a new deal or force a move away this summer.

And the Gunners are hopeful this could be the summer Real finally do business with regards to the Frenchman.

The Emirates Stadium club have been alerted to Real's growing interest in Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and feel the Spanish giants will look to cash in on Benzema to fund a move for the Uruguayan.

Meanwhile, Wenger insists he has no qualms of playing contact rebels Lukasz Fabianski and Bacary Sagna at Wembley.

The Gunners duo are out of contract after Saturday's FA Cup Final against Hull City and have both rejected new contracts.

Last game? Bacary Sagna could play against Hull in the FA Cup final, despite failing to sign a new contract to stay at Arsenal

Safe hands: Lukasz Fabianski, who is set to leave the Emirates this summer, could start at Wembley on Saturday

Sagna has been a regular at right-back this season, while Fabianski has played in all the club's FA Cup games.

And Wenger says he has no fears about playing the pair despite the contract stand-offs.

'I've got no problems with playing them. I told you many times, for me a professional is to give your best until the last day of your contract.

'That's for me the real professional. I don't doubt their integrity, their desire to win and their commitment at all.'
