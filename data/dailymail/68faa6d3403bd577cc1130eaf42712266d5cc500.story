The leaking of secret surveillance techniques by Edward Snowden has made the world a more dangerous place, a top officer warned last night.

Cressida Dick said the former US National Security Agency contractor’s disclosures, printed by The Guardian newspaper, caused ‘enormous damage’ and ‘hand[ed] the advantage to terrorists’.

The Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner added: ‘The so-called Snowden revelations have made our work more difficult. The actions he took helped to signal to people who may try to do us harm  how to avoid surveillance and other techniques.

‘In my view that is not going to make the world safer, it is going to make it more dangerous. It has affected public confidence in our abilities to do a job that I believe we do carefully, proportionately and using our powers sparingly within the law.’

Speaking to a meeting of police chiefs in her last days as Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Miss Dick said the police were ‘staring into the abyss’ because of a political deadlock over access to sensitive internet communications.

Terrorists and other top-level criminals were taking advantage of rapidly changing technology to evade the security services.

Politicians must get to grips with laws allowing police to use so-called ‘communications data’, Miss Dick said, adding that terrorist investigations will be hampered unless police and spies can retain data, including internet browsing and emails.

She said: ‘I believe that as technology changes, we are beginning to stare into the abyss. Make no mistake, continuing erosion of this capability without the necessary legislative changes will severely impact on our ability to continue terrorist investigations.’ 

Asked about the outbreak of extreme violence in Iraq, Miss Dick said the security services were watching the ‘ghastly conflagration’ closely.

She said: ‘It is clearly an enormous world-changing event which will have all sorts of ramifications and it may or may not heighten the risk to the UK of terrorism.’

She added that police had no information yet that British jihadists have travelled from Syria to join the wave of barbaric Islamist fighters.

But she said police were conscious that hundreds of Britons fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad could move and threaten other areas in  the world.

Miss Dick also appealed to the Government to leave terrorism units in the hands of police forces, including the Met, rather than hand them to the National Crime Agency.

She said a ‘messy divorce’ risked making the police response to complex terrorist threats less effective and more difficult to co-ordinate.
