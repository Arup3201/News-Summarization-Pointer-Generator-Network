It is an ambitious trip that has demanded meticulous planning, navigating and attention to detail.

But a 20-year-old hoping to become the youngest person to fly around the world solo overlooked one small, but very significant, item - his passport.

Jack Wiegand, from Fresno, California, began his flight last Thursday when he flew from his hometown to Boulder, Colorado.

Wiegand piloted his first introductory glider at 13 and on his 14th birthday, he became the youngest pilot in his flying club to solo a glider

He then flew to New York via Missouri - but stumbled when he arrived at Iqaluit, Canada and realised his passport was missing.

The ambitious pilot, who hopes to break the Guinness World Record on his mission, had left it at home in his photocopier, where he had been making copies of it.

His mistake cost him two days - which could scupper his chances of breaking the record.

The hopeful pilot told the Fresno Bee that when he handed his passport case to a customs official, he was shocked when he was told it was not there.

After frantically searching his plane, and convinced he must have left it during one of his stops where he visited friends and family, he called his mother who organised a search party.

But after the forgetful flyer recalled he had been making copies of his visas and identification, his mother discovered the passport at their home.

His passport was shipped overnight, much to the relief of Wiegand.

'I was a little annoyed that I forgot it, but it was nice to get the extra rest,' he told the Fresno Bee.

'I had time built in my schedule for mishaps like this. I just didn't expect it to be my passport and more of something later down the road.'

His ambitious route takes him through Mumbai, Rome, London, Bangkok and Tokyo in his quest to break the record

Jack Wiegand said he had factored in time for mishaps - but never thought it would be about forgetting his passport

After the mishap he flew directly to Reykjavik, Iceland in a seven-hour trip.

His route takes him through Mumbai, Rome, London, Bangkok, Tokyo.

So far he has flown to Manila in the Philippines - and has had no trouble with his passport so far.

The ambitious flyer says on his blog Solo 20.13 his dream to circle the globe began after he made history on his 13th birthday when he piloted his first introductory glider.

At just 14, he became the youngest pilot in the Central California Soaring Club to solofly a glider, and flew his first single-engine power plane solo when he was 16.

The pilot is being sponsored on his tour, and donating the proceeds to Big Brothers Big Sisters, the largest youth mentoring program in the United States, and International Agri-Center Ag Warriors, an organization focused on benefiting returning veterans.

The youngest pilot to fly around the world is Walter Toledo from Brazil, who was born in December 1991 and aged 21 circumnavigated the globe in a Piper Malibu Matrix PA-46 from Goiânia, Brazil, between 8 July and 29 August 2012.
