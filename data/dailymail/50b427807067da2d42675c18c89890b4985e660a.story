Britain is expected to be named the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world last year after outpacing the United States.

Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – increased by 2.6 per cent in 2014, the UK's best performance since 2007.

Figures published yesterday in Washington showed the US economy grew by 2.4 per cent. The other G7 nations – Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy – have yet to announce their figures for last year, but are also expected to lag behind the UK. 

The figures, as well as a separate report by the market research group GfK that showed a sharp rise in consumer confidence, are a boost for the Government with less than 100 days to go to the general election in May.

The International Monetary Fund expects Canada's economy to have grown by 2.4 per cent last year, Germany's by 1.5 per cent, France's by 0.4 per cent and Japan's by 0.1 per cent. Output in Italy is estimated to have fallen by 0.4 per cent.

Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Britain was in 'pole position'.

However, both the US and UK economies slowed at the end of last year and America is expected to overtake Britain this year.

The US economy grew by 0.65 per cent between October and December, compared with expansion of 1.25 per cent in the previous three months. Growth in the UK slowed from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent.

The IMF expects the US economy to grow by 3.6 per cent this year – much faster than the 2.7 per cent pencilled in for Britain.

But experts predicted that cheaper petrol and low interest rates will stimulate the economy this year.

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: 'The underlying story is one of the UK gradually consigning the financial crisis to history.

'Growth should accelerate again as the boost from oil and cheaper credit keeps retailers' tills ringing while the manufacturing cycle turns up again. We look for UK growth to accelerate to 3.2 per cent in 2015.'

He added: 'There are many possible pitfalls ahead, but then there always are. Whatever ones remain are less serious than those the UK has already overcome. The Government still needs to cut borrowing but that will be easier now the economy is healthier.

'Political uncertainty provides big risks, but we expect a Conservative-led stable government to emerge from May's general election.'

The buoyant outlook in Britain is in sharp contrast to the crisis-torn eurozone, which is feared to be heading for prolonged deflation.

The official statistics agency Eurostat said yesterday that inflation across the region fell from -0.2 per cent in December to a joint record low of -0.6 per cent in January.

The slump in living costs was driven by an 8.9 per cent slide in energy prices on the back of falls in the oil market.

Crude has dropped below $49 a barrel, compared with $115 last summer, cutting the price of essentials from petrol to heating.

Although falling prices ease pressure on household finances, and can in turn boost spending, deflation can cripple economies by making debts harder to pay.

It can also lead to businesses and households putting off spending as they wait for prices to fall further, hitting investment, profits, wages and jobs.

A second report from Eurostat yesterday showed the jobless rate in the single currency bloc dipped from 11.5 per cent in November to 11.4 per cent in December.

This is the lowest rate since August 2012, but still well above 5.8 per cent unemployment in the UK.

Risky business: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (pictured) government voted last Sunday to cancel  scaleing down planned budget surpluses required to pay down Greece's massive national debt

Germany and Greece drew battle lines last night in a spiralling row over the repayment of massive bailout loans.

Berlin said the demands of Alexis Tsipras's new far-Left Greek government for some of its debts to be written off were 'divorced from reality'.

But Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis replied that the government would no longer engage with officials representing the country's despised 'troika' of lenders – the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank.

Instead, the new government – which swept to power last weekend on a promise of ending years of austerity – would talk directly to other EU leaders to try to write off more than half of Greece's £179 billion in rescue loans.
