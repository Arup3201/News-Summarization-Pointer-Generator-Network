Qantas has announced a $2.84 billion loss after a battle, the worst result suffered by the airline in its history.

The massive after-tax loss was for the year ending June 30, compares to a $6 million profit a year ago. The result is considerably worse than anticipated, with analysts predicting a loss of between $800 million and $1 billion.

The loss comes as Qantas is undergoing a transformation program aimed to streamline and modernise its operations. In February it was announced the transformation program will see 5,000 redundancies across the company, 2,500 of which have already taken place.

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce announced the company's profits this morning

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce blamed the loss on the second year of market capacity growth in excess of demand, lower consumer confidence, and high fuel costs, which are up $253 million from last year to a total of $4.5 billion.

The losses included a $2.6 billion write-down to the value of its ageing international fleet, which were purchased at a time when the Australian dollar was weaker against the U.S. dollar, such as A380s, purchased in 2000 when the dollar was trading at US$0.57 compared to US$0.93 now.

Excluding the writedown and other one-off costs, Qantas made an underlying pre-tax loss of $646 million, compared to a $192 million profit a year ago.

Chief executive Alan Joyce described the result as 'confronting', but said the massive loss represented the year that is past.

'We have now come through the worst,' he said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the company is undergoing the biggest transition since Qantas was privatised in 1995.

Mr Joyce said the company was 'optimistic' that they would be able to deliver the company back to profitability and post a profit before tax in the first half of next year, saying that the transformation program was working.

'With our accelerated Qantas transformation program we are already emerging as a leaner, more focused and more sustainable Qantas group,' he said.

Unions and politicians have joined a chorus of criticism of Qantas management.

Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has today asked the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to investigate the airline, suggesting Qantas has breached investment regulations.

The Senator said Qantas management, led by Mr Joyce, had trashed the reputation of a great airline.

'I cannot believe what Alan Joyce says, I cannot understand why he is still in that position,' he said.

'Alan Joyce has made so many contradictory statements over the years and predictions, that have proved not be carried out.

'There's a case here for ASIC, as the corporate watchdog, to thoroughly investigate the statements made by Alan Joyce and his management team over the years.

'What's at stake here are 30 thousand jobs, the only people who should be sacked are Alan Joyce, Leigh Clifford the chairman and the board - they have presided over this.'

Meanwhile, the airline has ruled out selling or floating its profitable frequent flyer business, Qantas Loyalty in order to fund its turnaround. The frequent flyer program reported its fifth straight year of double-digit growth and has increased membership from five to 10 million over the last year.

'After careful consideration, our judgment was that Qantas Loyalty continued to offer major profitable growth opportunities, and there was insufficient justification for a partial sale,' Mr Joyce said.

However, Mr Joyce said they may consider the partial sale of the international business, which did not perform as strongly as the domestic business.

Qantas Group has established a holding company so they can seek future investment, but would not speculate about how much of when Qantas International would be sold.

The poor results were blamed on market capacity growth in excess of demand, lower consumer confidence, and high fuel costs, which are up $253 million from last year to a total of $4.5 billion
