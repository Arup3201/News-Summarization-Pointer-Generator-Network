Approval: Damien Hirst has won permission from planners to build an entire village near his childhood home

Damien Hirst has won approval from planners to build an entire village near his childhood home.

Controversial Hirst submitted a proposal last year to create 750 homes, a school, shops, health centre and offices on the edge of the seaside town of Ilfracombe, Devon.

The monster development - dubbed Hirst-on-Sea - sparked caused concern among residents who say it will swamp local services and ruin the countryside.

But Ilfracombe Town Council has given Hirst's vision the green light saying it will expand the town and breathe new life into the pretty coastal resort.

The 187-acre "Souther Extension" site covers much of Winsham Farm, a wildlife haven which the Turner Prize-winning artist bought for Â£900,000 ten years ago.

Hirst has already left his imprint on the town after lending it Verity, his 67ft bronze artwork of a pregnant woman carrying a sword.

Anne Thomas, who sits on Ilfracombe Town Council's planning committee, said local people would be thrilled to have a new school and better local amenities.

Hirst - best known for his sheep in formaldehyde - is also promising sports pitches, parkland, woodland, allotments and 250 new jobs.

Ms Thomas said: 'The town's population needs to increase to make the high street sustainable.

'There will be industrial units and shops - hopefully it will bring more jobs to the town.'

Hirst's development will now go to North Devon District Council for a final decision on whether it can begin.
