Western Australia batsman Tom Beaton caused a mild scare in Perth when he ducked into a bouncer and was hit on the head against Victoria.

Beaton, 24, wore the delivery from Dan Christian on his helmet and after the impact of the ball players from both sides rushed to see if he was OK.

Fortunately the Western Australia No 3 was fine and seemed more sheepish about the way he played the delivery.

There was relief all around the WACA ground, especially in light of the death of Phillip Hughes' death two weeks ago.

The left-hander died at the age of 25 after being hit by a short delivery from Sean Abbott and he has been mourned during Australia's first Test against India this week.

Beaton went on to make just 18 but in the ground they were just happy that he continued batting.

His team-mate Sam Whiteman was also in the wars, being hit on the head by a fielder's throw.
