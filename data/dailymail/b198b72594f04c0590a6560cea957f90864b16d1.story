A white Christmas could save Britain from a double-dip recession, Treasury forecasters have said.

A huge bout of snow will skew economic 
activity so that we do not experience two successive quarters of 
negative growth - the technical definition of recession.

A big freeze in the run up to December 31 will stop us going out to the shops but we will start buying again in the new year, it has been predicted.

Professor Stephen Nickell, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said that snow will delay spending but not prevent it.

'If you have a huge bout of heavy snow before Christmas that will probably rule out a double-dip recession because GDP will fall in the fourth quarter and bounce back in the first quarter,' he told the Telegraph.

But he added that a big freeze needed to come in the current quarter and not early in the new year.

Although recession may be avoided, snowfall before December 31 would merely alter spending patterns and not reinvigorate the economy.

Banks will bid against each other to obtain the 30 day loan

The Office for Budget Responsibility has said there is a one-in-three chance of a double-dip recession.

However, they admitted that
 the uncertain outlook in the single currency bloc meant its economic 
forecasts for Britain were in part based on guess work.

The watchdog said the UK outlook was ‘extremely uncertain’ and the Government could not count on its latest predictions.

They last week slashed its growth 
forecasts for 2012 from 2.5 per cent to just 0.7 per cent – throwing 
George Osborne’s plans to cut the deficit into disarray.

OBR chief Robert Chote said the 
forecasts were based on the assumption that bank lending will return to 
more normal levels in the next two years.

‘But we are only too happy to admit 
that that is very uncertain and a guess,’ added Stephen Nickell, who 
sits on the OBR with Mr Chote.

‘Banks do not trust each other very much and are extremely nervous about lending to each other,’ said Professor Nickell.

‘We have to make some assumptions 
about when this is going to end. Basically, that is a guess. We don’t 
have any more inside information than anybody else on that matter.’

It came during heated exchanges with MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in the wake of last week’s autumn statement.

Senior Conservative Andrew Tyrie, 
chairman of the committee, said there was ‘scepticism and caution’ among
 MPs about the OBR’s forecasting record – particularly after the sharp 
downgrades since March.

‘If you were so wrong in March how do we know you are right now?’ asked MP Michael Fallon.

‘You don’t,’ replied Professor Nickell. ‘We are talking about the future. No one knows the future.’

In an attempt to stave off a second brutal credit crunch which could tip the economy over the brink, the Bank of England yesterday offered to flood the economy with emergency funds.

Billions of pounds of loans will be made available to the banking system to tackle ‘exceptional stresses in financial markets,’ it said.

A new facility of the Bank of England will offer banks 30-day sterling liquidity on an ad hoc basis. This runs in line with their efforts to boost global liquidity

The launch of the crisis lending facility came as the eurozone was warned that its rescue fund could be stripped of its gold-plated AAA credit rating – leaving it dangerously short of firepower to bailout debt ridden countries.

Lending between banks and to households and businesses threatens to dry up as the debt storm in the eurozone sparks panic around the world.

Downing Street recently warned that a second credit crunch is underway and the Bank of England has said that British lenders face a ‘systemic crisis’.

The Bank of England hopes its latest move will keep money flowing around the financial system and prevent a rerun of the credit crunch of 2007 that tipped the economy into recession.

It came just a week after six central banks around the world – including in Britain, Europe and America – acted together to make it cheaper and easier to borrow dollars.

David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas in London, warned that if the ‘current market tensions continue into 2012’ it will be a ‘real struggle’ for banks to raise funds.

He said the action by central banks was ‘positive’ to ease short-term funding problems but ‘will not do a lot for the longer-term issues’.

The cost of mortgages and business loans is already rising amid worries about borrowers being able to repay.

A full-blown credit crunch next year would leave many households and small businesses starved of cash.

Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s added to the gloom with a warning that the eurozone bailout fund has a one-in-two chance of losing its credit rating.

It said the European Financial Stability Facility depends on the creditworthiness of the single currency’s six AAA rated countries – Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg.

Having said on Monday night that there was a 50-50 chance that each of those countries would lose their top-notch ratings, S&P last night said the EFSF was also vulnerable.

Leaders have so far failed to increase the size of the bailout fund from £378 billion to £860 billion and it is feared that a downgrade could effectively kill it off.

Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘There are already major question marks over whether it is going to raise the sort of money that is hoped. If it loses its AAA rating it has to pay more to raise funds and finds it more difficult.’

The downgrade of Germany would be particularly dangerous for the Eurozone as it could also call into question the EFSF’s permanent replacement – the European Stability Mechanism.

That would further hinder the Eurozone’s ability to support debt-ridden countries such as Italy and Spain and shore up the single currency.
