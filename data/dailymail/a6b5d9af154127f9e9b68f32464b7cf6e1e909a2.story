Brutal: A Swedish man is to stand trial for killing his girlfriend in a brutal sado-masochistic sex game. The acts he allegedly performed on her were similar to those carried out in the novel Fifty Shades of Grey, pictured

A Swedish man is to stand trial for the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' killing of his girlfriend in a brutal sado-masochistic sex game which ended in her death.

A 28-year-old German woman was hit 123 times with a wooden blackboard pointer as she was bound up with nylon tights and condoms.

Her 31-year-old 'master' said she was a willing 'sex slave' in their games.

But after her death police discovered her diary in which she wrote: 'You once said you did not want to see me in real pain. I am subservient but no masochist.'

The man was charged this week in connection with her death last October.

Police said he raised the alarm when she stopped breathing during their violent sex session and he tried to resuscitate her before the ambulance arrived at his home in Umea, northern Sweden.

The victim was treated for two days in the intensive care ward of a local hospital before her life support machines were switched off.

She had sustained terrible brain damage as a result of her airways being restricted.

The woman was an exchange student who arrived in Sweden to meet her 'boyfriend' she had befriended during a previous visit and with whom she kept in contact on the internet.

Nine days later she was dead.

Police said she had been taking a cocaine substitute and drinking alcohol before the brutal sex session.

Local prosecutor Ã…sa Jonsson said the woman had her mouth stuffed with something which led directly to her death.

'It is our belief he is directly responsible for her death,' she said and his trial for manslaughter gets underway next week.
