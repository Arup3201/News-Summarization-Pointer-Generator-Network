The singer praised by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini as ‘a super talent’ on last night’s X Factor is struggling to come to terms with the death of her step-brother.

Monica Michael, 23, revealed that Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou – who went with her to the audition seen by ten million viewers last night – died in a swimming pool tragedy in Ayia Napa in Cyprus after filming took place several weeks ago.

The 18-year-old, who had signed for League Two football club Stevenage FC, is believed to have slipped and fallen into the pool on August 18 while partying with friends. According to reports, he was under water for up to 20 minutes.

Heartbroken Monica, left, from North London, said: ‘Nobody could see his body at the bottom of the pool because it was so dirty.

She added: ‘If it was not for the fact that it was so filthy maybe someone could have seen him sooner and saved his life. It is just so devastatingly sad.

‘We are waiting for the autopsy. Apparently he was unconscious when he hit the water.’ Monica said she hoped her brother would have been proud of her performance.

‘Sav was a huge fan of the X Factor,’ she said. ‘He always wanted to see the show and how it was run and I am just happy he got to witness it before he died. I just hope I have made him proud up in heaven.’

The singer urged teenagers to be careful when travelling abroad.

Monica wowed all four judges with a song about her sister Natalie, 16, and said music had helped her turn her life around.

‘I was falling in with the wrong crowd and maybe drinking a little too much,’ she said. ‘When I was 19 or 20, I thought it was time to cut out certain people bringing negative vibes into your life.’

She said she hoped the song would help her sister learn from her own mistakes, adding: ‘I just wanted to let her know that I would always be there for her.’
