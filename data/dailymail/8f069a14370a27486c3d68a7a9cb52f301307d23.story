Heavy rains can be drastic  for rural farmers, damaging produce and in some cases even threatening their survival.

But one West Australian farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on Sunday.

Jordan Lynch, who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of Merredin, readied a surfboard, skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go 'skurfing' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing-on the freshly formed lake, reports ABC.

The farm had received 60mm of rain, causing the creek to overflow, a highly infrequent occurrence.

'I've only seen it flow twice before in my life, in 16 years, so I thought you can't miss an opportunity like that, so I grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler' he said.

Mr Lynch said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike, a role he was hoping some friends would fill.

But he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit, and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive.

'We were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy,' he said.

Mr Lynch said he has been skurfing for over a decade, swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up.

'Baandee Lake is pretty close to here, you can't get to the surf very often in Merredin, so I started skurfing behind the boat,' he said.

Another unorthodox water sport making a splash with rural farmers is barefoot water skiing.

Last month, the first ever Forbes Barefoot Water Ski Tournament was held in central New South Wales.

Forty competitors took part in the contest, some of them travelling from up to 100km away. The tournament is now poised to become an annual event.
