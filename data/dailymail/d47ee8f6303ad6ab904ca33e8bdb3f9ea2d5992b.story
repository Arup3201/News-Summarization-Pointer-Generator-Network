A forty-year-old American 'muscle' car that cost $5,000 (£3,000) new has just set a sale record after it was auctioned for a staggering $3.5 million (£2 million).

The classic 1971 Plymouth Hemi Cuda convertible - the model that starred in the action movies 'Fast and Furious' and 'Gone in 60 Seconds' - stunned the audience at the sale in Seattle as bidding soared to a record price.

Ten years ago another of the 11 originally made went under the hammer for $1 million but the sale of this example in blue has sent the market alight.

Pricey: The classic 1971 Plymouth Hemi Cuda convertible stunned the audience at the sale in Seattle as bidding soared to a record price of $3.5million

High power: The Hemi Cuda - fitted with a seven-litre V8 engine producing more than 425bhp - has been described as the 'Holy Grail' of muscle cars as manufacturers

The Hemi Cuda - fitted with a seven-litre V8 engine producing more than 425bhp - has been described as the 'Holy Grail' of muscle cars as manufacturers including Dodge, Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth all battled to produce race-quality cars easily capable of 150mph but with proper   suspension and handling.

The Barracuda was designed by a 27-year-old auto whiz-kid John Herlitz whose ideas were originally dismissed by the manufacturer - one critical fellow designer put an axe through the clay model of the proposed car.

Makeover: In 2000 the vehicle underwent a full restoration to its original specification down to its white-lettered tyres, bucket seats and a rare floor-mounted four-speed gear shift

Celebrity car: The car that has just sold was at one time owned by famous US cartoonist Russ Meyer before it passed on to an enthusiast who was caught up in a drugs investigation and the car was seized and sold off by law enforcement agencies

But Herlitz persuaded his bosses to go ahead with the project after design chief Elwood Engel drove the prototype through the lobby of the car giant's HQ leaving two black stripes of rubber on the floor.

The car that has just sold was at one time owned by famous US cartoonist Russ Meyer before it passed on to an enthusiast who was caught up in a drugs investigation and the car was seized and sold off by law enforcement agencies.

A spokesman for Mecum auctioneers said: 'We are simply delighted that such a special automobile reached a record price - it is the crown jewel of muscle cars and reflects the growing interest in and appreciation of some of the best cars that ever came out of Detroit.'
