Danny Cipriani will be on the plane on Tuesday when England's advance party fly to Auckland to prepare for the first Test, but he won't be in the starting line-up.

Barring a fundamental shift in management thinking over the next week, Freddie Burns will emerge from a season of personal trials and tribulations to start the series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park. 

In the enforced absence of Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler - due to fixture congestion - and the injured George Ford, the 24-year-old Burns will be thrust into the No 10 shirt and entrusted with the playmaker's role in a selection decision based more on familiarity than form.

Backing: Freddie Burns will emerge from a tough season to start for England against the All Blacks

Burns has been a regular fixture in the national set-up for two years, although his last Test appearance was on tour in  Argentina last June. Since then, his game has collapsed during the protracted saga of his move from Gloucester to Leicester, to the point where he was often an unused replacement for the West Country club with Billy Twelvetrees taking over at fly-half.

Yet he is destined to be selected in Auckland ahead of Cipriani, who was included in the initial group of 30 players flying from Heathrow to prepare for the first encounter with the world champions at a venue where they are unbeaten since 1994. This first batch of players will be supplemented next week by those involved in Saturday's Aviva  Premiership final.

Last week, England head coach Stuart Lancaster recalled Cipriani - who last played for his country in 2008 - but he gave clear indications that Burns remains above him in the No 10 hierarchy. 

'Danny has played well on a number of occasions, but there are areas of his game he could do better,' he said. 'I wouldn't go so far as to say that the (form) difference between the two has been vast.

'I think Freddie found some form towards the end of the season. Equally, there were one or two other players who hadn't played well for their clubs coming into the  England side for the Six Nations who managed to deliver great performances.

'Ben Morgan is a good example and Billy Twelvetrees - both playing for the same club (as Burns). You back your coaches, you back your  system and your ability to get the best out of people. 

'Form is temporary. You can regenerate form and belief in a player if you put them in the right environment. Once Freddie became aware of the opportunity in front of him, he has stood up as I expected him to and led the team.' 

Assessing Cipriani, Lancaster added: 'He's been quite quiet actually off the field. I don't know what the perception is but certainly he's quite quiet. He's been very diligent in making sure he's up to speed with learning the plays and calls.

'On the field it is a slightly different way of attack that we've generated here, different from the way he's been coached before. I think he's enjoyed that part of the reintroduction to the England team, working with Mike Catt and Andy Farrell in particular.

'He's been good on the field, growing in 
terms of his presence and leadership, because obviously as fly-half you 
have to have a voice, you have to be able to boss people around. I think
 his game's improving in that way as well. He's a little bit behind 
Freddie in that regard because Freddie has had so much time and 
experience with us over the last two years.

Challenge: Tour has started on the back foot for England coach Stuart Lancaster

'Even though Freddie hasn't played as many games for us in the last two years as someone like Owen  (Farrell), he has been in the camp a long time, so as a consequence  he understands it a little bit better.' 

England's coaches are optimistic that Twelvetrees will have recovered from an ankle injury in time for the second Test in Dunedin,  perhaps even the first at a push. They are also refusing to rule out the seemingly remote prospect of first-choice hooker Dylan Hartley playing some part in the tour.

'My understanding is he is very, very 
close now,' said Lancaster. 'We are sat here a week and a half away from
 a first Test he wouldn't have played anyway (due to Northampton 
commitments), and two-and-a-half weeks away from the  second Test.

Impressive: James Haskell has been rewarded for fine end-of-season form with England call

'There's a very good chance he's going to be ready by that point. You have a player of that experience available to us in a position where we've lost some experience, so if he came through this weekend, I'd be reasonably certain he'll be on the plane.' 

James Haskell has been rewarded for fine end-of-season form with a return to the ranks, while  Worcester full back Chris Pennell is in the mix for a Test debut as Anthony Watson of Bath is  struggling with a suspected hamstring strain. 

Lancaster and his assistants are awaiting medical bulletins  concerning Farrell and Mako Vunipola, and they must hope to avoid any mishaps involving their scrum-halves, fly-halves or loosehead props, given the presence of just two men in each position in the squad departing today.
