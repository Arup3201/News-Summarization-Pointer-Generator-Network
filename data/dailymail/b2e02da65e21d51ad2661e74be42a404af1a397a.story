Publishers of lads mags such as Nuts and Zoo have vowed to tone down the images of scantily-clad models on their front covers.

The move follows pressure from Tesco which came under attack from feminist groups and parenting websites for making money from the publications.

Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, said it will also change its magazine displays to make sure children cannot see the front cover images.

Restrictions: Tescos will stock magazines with tamer cover images. They will change their magazine displays so children will not be able to see the raunchy pictures

It will ban the sale of the magazines to anyone under the age of 18, putting them in the same category as drink and knives.

However, feminist groups behind the Lose the Lads Mags campaign said the safeguards did not go far enough.

They said the retailer should ban the magazines completely. They will also go ahead with a series of protests outside stores on August 24.

The campaign has been led by activist groups UK Feminista and Object and has been fronted by the British actress Romola Garai, who has made a video message.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We’ve had in-depth conversations with our customers about this issue, and we’re putting new measures in place.

Pressure: Tesco has urged lads mag publishers to tone down their front covers. Tesco, in turn, have been under attack from feminist and parenting groups who say their safeguards don't go far enough

‘We’ve listened carefully to the concerns raised by the campaign groups, but our priority is to make sure we meet our customers’ needs and expectations.’

But Kat Banyard, of UK Feminista, said: ‘Tesco has been forced to act because of the thousands of people who have protested against the UK’s biggest retailer selling such sexist and harmful publications. 

‘Age restricting lads mags is a half measure that does not address the damaging impact caused by stocking these sexist magazines. 

‘Significantly, they will continue to profit from selling them.’
