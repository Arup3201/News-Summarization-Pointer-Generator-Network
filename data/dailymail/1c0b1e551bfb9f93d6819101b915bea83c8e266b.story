Pledge: Yodel executive chairman Dick Stead has apologised for the delay in deliveries and claimed the company will soon be back on track

The boss of a major courier firm has promised customers hit by delays to deliveries in the lead up to Christmas: 'We will get back on track.'

Yodel, the second largest delivery firm in the UK and used by a string of major stores, was forced to temporarily suspend new collections from retailers and admitted parcels may be delayed by up to three days as it struggled to cope with a surge of online orders on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Today the company's executive chairman Dick Stead apologised for the problems. 

He told the BBC: 'I had a phone call from a gentleman who unfortunately had waited eight days for his parcel and that's totally unacceptable.

'You have to remember that from the point of order to delivery there are a number of points in that chain. 

'Whatever, the retailers and the parcel companies as an industry as a whole -we've got to do better under this circumstances.

'Again, I say apologies but we will get it back on track.'

Yodel is one of the couriers used by firms including Amazon, Waterstones and Boots.

The delivery firm's Twitter feed was awash with complaints from customers.

Cathy Bussey said: 'Poor service from @YodelOnline. No parcels, no card thru door, no response to my tweet for help.'

Ryan Thomas tweeted: 'Has anyone ever received a order when delivered by yodel? Horrendous service.'

Another customer wrote: 'My delivery was due on the 8th, still not arrived & still no update on your website... Update please?!'

In an update posted on its website on Friday Yodel insisted that its delivery service has not been suspended and parcels will continue to be distributed over the weekend.

It added: 'Today, we have re-commenced many collections from our clients, with the remainder coming back on line no later than Monday.

Waterstone's, which uses Yodel's services, has seen significant delays in the deliveries of parcels

'We are working with all our clients to manage the flow of new volume into our network. By Monday we expect to resume our normal service.'

Amazon customers took to a forum on the site to express their frustrations at orders due to be delivered by Yodel.

Couriers for Yodel are paid as little as 50p per delivery and must deliver up to 160 parcels a day, it is claimed.

Yodel, voted the worst parcel service in the UK, delivers for firms from Amazon and Waterstones to Boots and Argos.

But complaints have stacked up in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

There are claims of items left in bushes, in bins or with unknown neighbours, and of deliveries at night. Now stories have emerged of drivers paid just a few pence per parcel. On an online forum where staff rate employers, a man in Nottingham said he was offered the equivalent of 50p a parcel. He said: ‘How they expect you to earn even a half decent wage is beyond me.’

He worked out that by delivering one parcel every six to eight minutes, he would earn £2.50 an hour after deducting petrol, which seasonal couriers must buy. Job ads for seasonal drivers say they work ‘at some pace’, warning: ‘It’s no mean feat.’

A Scottish driver, who spent seven years at Yodel until 2012, said: ‘December is always the worst time. Some workers were out until 10pm. The workers had a target . . . it ranged from 110-160 parcels a day. You couldn’t bring back more than 2 per cent. Guys were coming back with 20 to 30 parcels saying they couldn’t do it. A lot of the workers were off with stress.’

Customers were just as unhappy. Twitter user ‘Yodelhell’ said: ‘All we want is our packages delivered intact. Is it too much to ask?’ Rachel Webber said her order showed she missed a delivery at 1am. She said: ‘I am going to assume I was asleep.’

Yodel said deliveries should be no later than 9pm. A spokesman said many workers had a regular salary but some were self-employed and paid per delivery.

Dave Fletcher wrote: 'My TV was delivered at 10pm and 3 days late! I'm now waiting for a mattress topper which is 2 days delayed!'

Another said: 'Ordered a Sealey (emergency power pack) for Prime delivery, supposed to arrive Monday. 

'By Wednesday still nothing arrived although Yodel tracking said it was in the same town.'

An Amazon spokesman said: 'Amazon orders continue to be processed and delivered in the normal timeframe. 

For example, Prime customers can order for next day delivery.'

Waterstones customers were also reporting problems.

Mary Novakovich tweeted: 'Just discovered that my @Waterstones parcel has been sent via @YodelOnline - and it's been delayed. Now there's a surprise. *grinds teeth*'

In response to one query, Waterstones said: 'Yodel are currently handling more parcels than they expected, so some deliveries are taking longer than we would like.Very sorry if this affects your order.'

A spokeswoman for Boots said: 'We know how important it is for our customers, particularly at this time of year, to get their packages delivered on time, which is why our delivery system is set up using a multi-carrier strategy.

'This involves using some third party carriers and our own transportation system, meaning we have agility to be able to quickly switch volumes between carriers to ensure continuity and maximum opportunity for delivery to our customers.'

Marks & Spencer has also been hit by unrelated problems, with customers warned that standard delivery could take up to nine days - four days longer than normal.

A spokeswoman said: 'Our customer is always our top priority and that is why we've extended some of our delivery options. The vast majority of orders are delivered on time.'

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, said: 'Consumers tell us they are put off buying online because of delivery issues, which is why we're campaigning to Stamp Out Dodgy Deliveries. We want to see retailers make sure delivery services are first class, first time.'

Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, recently announced that their delivery service had been delayed by 'the unprecedented number of orders received during Black Friday Deals Week'

Delivery firms blamed the chaos on a massive increase in online shopping, fuelled by record sales on Black Friday two weeks ago. pictured, customers shove eachother at Black Friday Sales in Asda, Wembley
