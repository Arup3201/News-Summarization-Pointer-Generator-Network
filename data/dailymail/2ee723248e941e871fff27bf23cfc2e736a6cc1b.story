An Arizona family believe their late mother 'had a hand' in ensuring her beloved engagement ring found its way home to them after being missing for 20 years.

Phoenix mother Jean Daly had the names of her five children - Becky, Debbie, Dan, Carl and John - engraved on the ring, but it has not been seen in two decades.

Daly died two years ago, and her family never believed they would see the heirloom again.

But then the strangest thing happened.

Family heirloom: Jean Daly had the names of her five children engraved onto her wedding, but it had been missing for 20 years. Until now

Higher power: The family of Jean Daly (left) believe she 'had a hand' in seeing her ring's return, after passing away two years ago 

A stranger, Michael Whiting, who lives out of state, found the ring in a used van he had bought. 

He the van was bought at auction, so he couldn't contact the owners, but Whiting found some papers inside that suggested it once based in Arizona.

He posted a picture of the ring to Facebook and urged people to share it to help him solve the mystery.

The post was shared over 500,000 times.

Then local station ABC15 aired the photo of the ring on Sunday and some family members recognized it immediately.

Whiting is now mailing the ring to Mesa so it can be reunited with the family of its owner. 

'This guy, instead of going and hocking it at a pawn shop or selling it, he wants to find the owner, and he’s gone to great lengths to do that,' said Becky Thorsen, one of the daughters.

'We can’t even remember the last time we’ve seen it, that’s how long it’s been.

'I’m just delighted, because we feel like our mom is thinking of us.'

Touched: Sister's Debbie Horner and Becky Thorsen (center) and Becky's daughter Natalie can't believe they got the ring back

For Thorsen, there is no question as to whether there were other-worldly powers at play.

'My mom had a hand in this, I know it,' she said.

'I don't believe it, I know it.' 

'My brothers and sister and I felt like somehow our mother orchestrated that this ring would be found at this time,' Thorsen added.

'She has been gone for two years and we just sold the family home and miss her very much.'
