Benjamin Heale has been jailed after he parked so close to a police car that an officer was able to smell his stash of skunk

A drug dealer was caught after he parked so close to a police car that an officer was able to smell his stash of skunk.

Benjamin Heale was caught with £3,000 worth of home-grown drugs after recruiting a friend to drive him from one side of Tiverton, Devon, to the other with the drugs.

Police constable Saren Isaac was two cars away from Heale as he pulled into a Tesco superstore.

The dealer got out for a soft drink, leaving his passenger window open and the strong smelling drugs on the seat.

While he was inside the store the Pc went to investigate and arrested him as he came out of the shop.

He tried to blame his friend, John Soundy, who was giving him the lift, but Heale's fingerprints were found inside the two ziplock bags which contained almost half a kilo of skunk.

Heale, 27, of Tiverton, denied possession with intent to supply but was found guilty by a jury at Exeter Crown Court.

Soundy, 27, also of Tiverton, admitted the same charge.

Heale was jailed for 12 months by Recorder Paul Grumbar at Exeter Crown Court. Soundy was jailed for four months, suspended for 18 months.

The judge said Heale’s case was aggravated by previous convictions for cannabis dealing, telling him: 'The difficulty with you is that you don’t seem to have learned your lesson.

'It may have been different if you had admitted your role rather than trying to blame Mr Soundy.

'This was a substantial amount of cannabis worth a significant amount of money and you clearly had a significant role.'

Soundy was told he was not being sent straight to jail because his role was lesser, he had admitted the offence and had given evidence at Heale’s trial.

During a two day case, Pc Isaac told the jury how she recognised the smell of the drugs and arrested first Soundy, then Heale.

She said: 'The smell of the cannabis was intense.'

She added that Soundy tried to take all the blame but later changed his story and explained he had only been giving his friend a lift because Heale did not want to carry the cannabis through the streets.

Soundy told the jury he lied to police on the day of the search because he owed Heale money and was trying to do him a favour.

Heale told the jury he texted his friend to ask for a lift and noticed the smell of the drugs as soon as he got into the van.

He said he looked in the bag and saw the cannabis but it was not his and he had nothing to do with it.

James Taghdissian, defending, said Soundy’s life had moved on since 2011 and he now has a young child, steady relationship and well paid job and had turned his back on cannabis.

Malcolm Clarke, for Heale, said he has also turned over a new leaf, is working for an engineering firm, and helps his girlfriend look after her three young children.
