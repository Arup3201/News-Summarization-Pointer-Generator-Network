It was a moment that shocked audiences across the globe - during the World Cup images showed Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez appearing to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during a match between the two nations.

And using new Fifa 15 game some fans have humorously recreated the infamous moment.

In pictures posted to Twitter fans have claimed the game is ‘so realistic’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the Barcelona striker banned from football for four months.

Images from the Fifa 15 video game appear to show the Uruguayan striker biting other football players (shown). Suarez was infamously banned for four months during the World Cup for seeming to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, and fans have taken to Twitter mocking the striker with images from the game

‘FIFA 15 is so realistic’ @djruch10 writes beneath an image that sees Suarez sinking his teeth into a player.

‘Was playing the FIFA 15 Demo earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic,’ @ManCityArmy1894 said under a similar image.

Of course, the ability to bite plays is not actually a feature of the new game.

Rather, the gamers have used the game’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game.

The glitches seem to show Suarez’s mouth sinking into players, and it doesn’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action.

Despite being labelled 'so realistic' the ability to bite other players it not really a new feature, but rather just a result of gamers positioning players in the game to make it look like another biting incident

Suarez signed for Barcelona from Liverpool after the World Cup despite the incident.

However he is still yet to make his debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting Chiellini.

And that is replicated in FIFA 15, as fans picking up the game will be unable to use Suarez in the game’s career mode for the entirety of his ban.

However playing one of the game's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one-on-one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken.
