This week TV presenter Phillip Schofield was the latest to reveal he's a fan of the weight loss plan of the moment - The Fast Diet.

The eating plan, and others like it such as The 5:2 diet, are taking Britain by storm and involve intermittent fasting. Mr Schofield admitted he has lost 9lb since sticking to it.

Followers must only consume 500 calories (600 for men) on two fasting days a week and can then eat what they want on the other five days. 

Slim pickings: Experts have warned that fasting can lead to people missing out on vital nutrients

But the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute have now warned that such denial of food can lead to people missing out on vital vitamins and minerals.

They told the Irish Independent that people already deficient in iron or calcium could cause their health to deteriorate further by fasting.

They also warned that people shouldn't start the diet without first getting medical advice on whether it is safe for them to do so.

Finding a balance: Over-indulging on non-fasting days can negate the benefits

'My advice would be don't do this if 
you're pregnant, diabetic or on medication, and if you are planning to 
do it take advice from a dietitian to make sure you don't miss out on 
vital nutrients,' INDI spokeswoman Sarah Keogh told the newspaper.

The craze for The Fast Diet and The 5:2 Diet follows on from the recent popularity of the diets such as Atkins and Dukan. Ms Keogh added that people should wait until long-term research has been carried out on fasting diets before jumping on the latest bandwagon.

'It's a fad, it's not the worst fad, but 
there haven't been long-term studies to show if people can follow it for
 a year or two years,' she said.

The Fast Diet was created by medical journalist Dr Michael Mosley whose book on the subject with Mimi Spencer has become a bestseller.

As well as helping people lose weight, they say fasting can improve your health by lowering cholesterol and blood pressure and balancing insulin levels - making developing diabetes less likely.

But Ms Keogh warned that people will only gain these benefits if they eat healthy on their non-fasting days. However, the danger is because people are starving and in denial on their fast days, they could over-eat on their non-fasting days.

Nutritionist Dr Sarah Schenker, who has written a companion recipe book to The Fast Diet with Mimi Spencer, agreed this can be a downfall for people on the diet.

She told the MailOnline people should not think of their non-fasting days as licence to eat unhealthy.

Advocates: Mimi Spencer and Dr Michael Mosley's Fast Diet has taken the country by storm - but experts say the long-term benefits need to be ascertained

'The point is your body becomes calorie deficient on the fasting days. You don't want to then overindulge on calories on the non-fasting days or your weekly calorie intake will remain the same,' she explained.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is another fan of The Fast Diet but admits he also has concerns on its sustainability.

He said in The Guardian: 'I've lost eight pounds already, and I find the whole thing rather 
exhilarating. I feel I might just be part of a health revolution.

'But is
 it really sustainable, for me or for significant numbers of others? Can I honestly say I'm backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now?'
