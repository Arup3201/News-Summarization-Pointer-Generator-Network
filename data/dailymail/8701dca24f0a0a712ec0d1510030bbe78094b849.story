Aston Villa are close to appointing Arsenal’s chief commercial officer Tom Fox as their new chief executive, it is believed.

Owner Randy Lerner has been in the country for advanced talks with Fox about the position, which was vacated when Paul Faulkner surprisingly left in July.

Great start: Aston Villa won their opening game of the Premier League season, beating Stoke 1-0

Boost: Fox's appointment would aid Villa boss Paul Lambert 

Lerner, who put the club up for sale at the end of last season, has taken a more hands on role but wants a set-up in place that supports manager Paul Lambert and aids commercial activity.

American Fox, at Arsenal since 2009, helped the club secure a £170million kit deal with Puma last year.
