After four days of  searching, officials believe that have finally captured and killed the mountain lion that viciously mauled a 6-year-old boy over the weekend.

The 65-pound juvenile male mountain lion was caught near the Picchetti Ranch Zinfandel Trail, and shot with a rifle after it began showing unusually aggressive behavior towards the dogs who located it and chased it into a tree.

This all happened just 130 yards from the site where the boy was attacked on Sunday afternoon.

Caught and killed: The mountain lion who attacked a child over the weekend has been captured and killed

Heroes: The dogs (above) that managed to locate the cat then chased the animal into a tree, where officials had no choice but to shoot it due to its 'unusual behavior'

On the loose: A look at the lion's paw prints

Officials, however, are still trying to figure out what caused the animal to behave in this manner.

'Everything about [the attack] was so vastly beyond our scope, beyond any statistical reason why lions do what they do, that there is no way to explain why he attacked,' said Lt. Patrick Foy of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

And there is also the possibility this is not the same lion.

'I think it's very, very highly likely, but we can't put a 100 percent stamp on it until we get the DNA,' Foy said. 

More than half of California is considered prime mountain lion habitat, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 cougars roam statewide. 

Clean up: The Picchetti Ranch Open Space trails remain closed while Fish and Wildlife officials pick up mountain lion traps

Long search: Officials spent four days combing the park in hopes of locating the lion

Officials had originally just wanted to tranquilize the animal, but its behavior made that option impossible.

'No one at the department wanted to destroy this animal but protecting public safety is a first and foremost priority,' said the Dept. of Fish and Wildlife in a statement. 

The animal is now on its way to Sacramento for a full DNA test to see if it is the same cat that attacked the boy, and to be tested for rabies or other diseases.

Picchetti Ranch Open Space trails remain closed meanwhile, while Fish and Wildlife officials pick up all the mountain lion traps they put down over the course of the week, according to ABC 7.

 

Danger: A sign at the park warns visitors of what to do should they encounter a lion

Proof: The lion is now en route to Sacramento, where its DNA will be tested to see if it matches that found on the shirt of the boy who was attacked

There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities, aged 35, 40 and 56.

The last attack was in July 2012 when a lion attacked a 63-year-old man as he camped near the Yuba River in Nevada County. But the victim managed to fight the animal off.

'It's quite rare,' Lt. Patrick Foy of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife told the LA Times. 'People are far more likely to be attacked by a dog.'

Even though lions tend to avoid humans, about half of California is mountain lion habitat, so residents and visitors should be prepared.

If you come face-to-face with a lion, you should stand tall, wave your arms, shout aggressively and fight back, Foy said.

People are also discouraged from hiking or biking alone or during lions' most active times, which are dawn, dusk and night.

Residents living in mountain lion country are also encouraged to deer-proof their land, cut back bushes to reduce hiding places and bring their pets and pet food inside at night. 

The young boy was among a group of 10 - comprised of his parents, another pair of parents and kids - hiking at the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve when the attack occurred on Sunday.

The boy's father told investigators his son was about 10 feet ahead of the group when the lion 'came out of nowhere' and attacked the boy.

He then dragged the boy to a nearby bush. 

The boy's father and the other male adult in the group shouted and acted aggressively toward the mountain lion to scare it away.

'He's very, very lucky that the parents were so close,' Lt. Foy said at the time.

Hours after they managed to carry the boy to safety, teams found track marks showing that showed the lion continued to follow the group after they had fought it off.

The boy is expected to recover from his injuries, which were described as moderate and included puncture wounds and scratches. 

The boy's family has repeatedly declined to publicly discuss the ordeal.

There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities.

The youngest victim ever attacked was a five-year-old girl in Caspers Wilderness Park in 1986, but she escaped with her life.
