Sir Cliff Richard has been chosen as an unlikely co-star for singer Morrissey in a major U.S. show – but admitted he initially thought it was a wind-up.

The 73-year-old confessed to searching for the ex-Smiths frontman on Google because he could not name any of his hits.

The unusual combination is one of two shows Morrissey has lined up with veteran pop knights, the other being with Sir Tom Jones in Los Angeles.

English singer Steven Patrick Morrissey has had many hits, but Sir Cliff admitted he would struggle to name them

Sir Cliff told BBC Radio 5Live yesterday: ‘I said, “My initial answer is yes but can you check it’s not a joke? Is there an ulterior motive?” [My manager] got hold of Morrissey’s management and he said, “No, Morrissey’s a fan and he’d like you to be there.” So I said yes please.

‘The chances of me singing for 15,000 people in New York are pretty well nil … So I thought it would be great.’

Sir Cliff admitted he would struggle to name Morrissey’s hits. “I couldn’t tell you the titles. I’ve just googled him to see what kinds of crowds he plays to and what sort of show he did. I’m thinking, okay, it looks like a pop-rock show,” he said.

Morrissey is renowned for his hatred of meat and has at times insisted on it being banned in the vicinity of some performances, even walking off stage at the smell of burgers.

But Sir Cliff, 73, appeared to underestimate Morrissey’s conviction. He said: 'I like to think he might eat some meat when I arrive, but I wouldn’t expect him to. So I don’t think he’d expect me to be vegetarian.

'If I found he was offended by people eating meat then I won’t eat it in front of him. But I’ll have a chicken curry afterwards.'

Asked about his set list for the night, he said: 'I’m going to cut my show down to the best one-hour segment I can make it.

'I’ve had hits in the States. I did have two songs in the top 10 - Devil Woman and We Don’t Talk Any More. They will have heard of Wired For Sound. They know Suddenly, which I sang with Olivia [Newton John]. I’m just going to make it really difficult for Morrissey to follow me.

He went on: 'People don’t know me in America. That’s why I had no problem saying yes. If Morrissey asked me to support him in England, I’d question it greatly. I’d say, "You can have the first half and I’ll have the second half."

'But this is a different world. I’ve had nine top 30 hit singles [in the US] but I have no identification out there. All I can say is "Thank you Patrick, or Morrissey" - I’m not quite sure how to refer to him - and I’m so grateful that he’s thought of having me on the show. I’d love to play to 15,000 people in the States and now I will.'

Morrissey - whose Christian name is actually Steven, although his middle name is Patrick - is playing a series of dates in the U.S.

This is not the first time Morrissey has teamed up with a 1960s chart star. In 1984 The Smiths duetted with Sandie Shaw on a new version of their debut single Hand In Glove which made the top 30.
