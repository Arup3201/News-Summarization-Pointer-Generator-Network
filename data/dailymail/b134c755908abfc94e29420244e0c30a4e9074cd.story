Brendan Rodgers led a group of Liverpool legends to pay their respects at the site of the 9/11 memorial while the team are in New York.

The Reds manager was joined by former players Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush and Robbie FowlerÂ  at the 9/11 memorial museum where they spoke with museum president Joe Daniels and retired Firefighter Tim Brown.

It was clearly an emotional moment as the Reds manager as he laid down a floral wreath adorned with the club's scarf featuring the words 'You'll never Walk Alone' at the site where so many people lost their lives.

The 
Reds have been staying in Manhattan since Tuesday as part of their 
pre-season tour of the US - which included a penalty shootout victory over Manchester City on Wednesday - before they move on to Charlotte in 
North Carolina.

A total of 2,977 people from 93 different nations lost their lives in
 the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the moving storywas told to the manager and Liverpool members during the visit.

'I would like to sincerely thank museum president Joe Daniels and 
retired New York firefighter Tim Brown for taking time to show us around
 the memorial this afternoon," Rodgers told the official Liverpool website.

'It was a great privilege to lead the Liverpool delegation of Kenny 
Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler and Billy Hogan to a site which 
carries great significance, not just for America but the entire world.

'I have visited Manhattan on a number of occasions, both privately 
and professionally and it is, without doubt, one of the greatest places 
on the planet, with a spirit and a character that is quite unique.

'When I found out New York was on our pre-season schedule I wanted 
us, as a club, to come and pay our respects where the World Trade Center
 once stood and hear some of the emotional, distressing, powerful but 
also inspiring accounts of that fateful day.

'The stories told to us by firefighter Brown were profoundly moving 
and touched every one of us. This visit will live in my memory for some 
time.'
