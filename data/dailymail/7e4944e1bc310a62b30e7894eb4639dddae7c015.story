Outspoken Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie wants an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath, to include renouncing of Sharia Law and in, arguably, her most controversial call yet, she wants the death penalty reintroduced.

Capital punishment officially ended in Australia in 1984, when revoked by Western Australia but had not been used after 1967 when Ronald Ryan was sentenced to death by hanging in 1967.

But as debate rages over Indonesia's use of the ultimate punishment on convicted Australian drug-smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, Ms Lambie insists treason against this country should be punished in the most severe fashion.

Outspoken Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie wants an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath, to include renouncing of Sharia Law and in, arguably, her most controversial call yet, she wants the death penalty reintroduced

Teenage defector Abdullah Elmir, from Bankstown in south-western Sydney, is among who has taken up arms for terror groups and would be one of those who could be considered guilty of treason under Senator Lambie's plan

Ms Lambie wants treason charges laid against all ex-Australians who have taken up arms with terror groups such as ISIS

'It’s time we adopted a much tougher approach to people who are Australian citizens and have fought or are now fighting alongside our enemies, or assisting them,' she said.

'In those cases the Australian laws are very clear. Australian citizens who take up arms against members of our ADF (Australian Defence Force) are guilty of treason.

Strangely no Australian politician, including Mr Abbott, has been able to explain why the most serious of federal charges - treason or sedition, has not been laid against the hundreds of Australian citizens who have joined the fight with ISIS or are assisting them back home in Australia. I want to know why?' Senator Lambie asked.

The Senator has urged Prime Minister Tony Abbott to overhaul laws to take tougher action against would-be terrorists in Australia 

The one-time Palmer United Party politician believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate ISIS fighters returning to Australia is a waste of time, and dangerous.

'Part of my solution to help defeat ISIS is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for Australian juries who find our citizens guilty of treason,' she said, explaining that would be categorised by taking up arms against Australian military personnel.

'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism.

'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism.'

Ms Lambie also insists that Islamic State supporters in Australia found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across Syria and Iraq, should immediately have their rights as an Australian citizen revoked.

Under Australian law currently; citizenship can be removed "if a person commits a ‘serious crime’ at any time prior to the person becoming an Australian citizen, provided they are convicted for 12 months or more for that crime. However, this applies only to applications for Australian citizenship by conferral, not to those who acquired Australian citizenship automatically. However, revocation cannot occur if (it) would render a citizen stateless (without nationality)."

Ms Lambie also insists that Islamic State supporters in Australia found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across Syria and Iraq, should immediately have their rights as an Australian citizen revoked.

'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism.'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism,' Jacqui Lambie said

'Our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an Australia citizen is opposed to Sharia Law, a theocratic, anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights,' according to Senator Jacqui Lambie

'At the very least, they should not be allowed to vote, stand for parliament or receive any government benefits until an official investigation establishes that they have not assisted our enemies in any way,' she added.

'If they are found to have assisted our enemies they must be charged with Sedition and put in jail for up to 7 years.

'She went further, calling for an overhaul of the Australian citizenship oath.

'Our enemies in ISIS want to impose Sharia Law on us and the rest of the world,' Senator Lambie said.

'Our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an Australia citizen is opposed to Sharia Law, a theocratic, anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights.'

The Senator's preferred version of the new oath, reads: 'From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights, liberties and opposition to Sharia Law I respect and whose laws I will uphold and obey.'

She went on to claim that 'if immigrants, refugees or other prospective Australian citizens have a problem with swearing an oath to oppose Sharia Law, then they can leave Australia, and go to a country which does tolerate an anti-democratic law and culture - that the Islamic State terrorists want to impose on us by force'.

'It’s clear cut, from now on, it’s 100 per cent the Australian way or the highway,' said Senator Lambie.
