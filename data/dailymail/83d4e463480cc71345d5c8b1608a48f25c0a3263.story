As a Bitcoin entrepreneur, Tyler Winklevoss is probably used to swimming with sharks.

The Harvard graduate, one half of the twins who famously sued Facebook
 founder Mark Zuckerberg claiming he stole their idea, filmed a shark in Montauk, New York on Friday night.

The rowing champion posted the footage to Instagram with the caption, 'Shark Attack! #Montauk'.

It showed a shark fin cruising along the water's surface while Winklevoss is presumably in a boat.

Winklevoss also tagged friend and photographer Ben Watts in the Instagram post.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, 32, were born in Southampton and are known to return to the New York party town during the summer.

The twins, immortalized in the 2010 movie 'The Social Network' as the Winklevii, are regulars on the Hamptons party circuit, and are snapped at numerous society events.

Cameron Winklevoss co-founded blog Guest of a Guest which covers society events in the areas and cities including the Hamptons. The blog includes a picture database of high profile people at prominent Hampton events, often attended by the Winklevoss twins.

New York Daily News reported the brothers last year spent the Fourth of July weekend in the Hamptons.

One on night, they attended Ben Watts and nightlife guru Jeffrey Jah’s 11th annual Shark Attack Sounds event at the iconic Montauk Yacht Club. When someone asked Tyler how to distinguish him and his brother, he joked: 'My brother is gay. I am not.'

Olympians Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, however, are best known for their feud with Zuckerberg, their former classmate and business partner.

They claimed they developed a university-based social network called HarvardConnection, which Zuckerburg appropriated along with the source code to create Facebook.

The twins sued and after four years of legal wrangling, reached a $65 million settlement. 

They unsuccessfully sued Zuckerberg again, claiming the stock portion of the settlement had been undervalued.
