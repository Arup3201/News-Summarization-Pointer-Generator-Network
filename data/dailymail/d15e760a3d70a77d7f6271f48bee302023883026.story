A middle-aged man and woman have been found dead in a £350-a-night luxury hotel room after allegedly forming a suicide pact.

The bodies of the pair, who were not believed to have been married, were discovered in the same hotel room at The Forbury Hotel in Reading, Berkshire, on Monday.

Police confirmed the man, who is in his 60s, and woman, in her 50s, were both pronounced dead at the scene and said their deaths were being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'.

The Forbury Hotel, which boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience', remained sealed off yesterday while forensic specialists carried out their investigations.

Thames Valley Police confirmed today that both the man and woman's next of kin had been informed of the discovery.

A spokesman for Berkshire Coroner's Office said the names of the couple could not be released as they were yet to be formally identified.

It is understood paramedics were called to the grade II listed hotel yesterday afternoon when a chambermaid discovered the bodies after the pair failed to check out.

The door to their room remained locked and after the worker gained entry, she raised the alarm.

The manager of the hotel refused to discuss the incident when contacted by MailOnline today.

It is believed the pair may have hatched a plan to kill themselves and may have taken an overdose.

Guests at the hotel told how the pair, who checked into the hotel on Sunday evening and booked a double room for the night, may have been suffering severe illness.

It was believed the couple, who are said to live in a nearby town, decided to splash out on some luxury where they could spend their final hours.

One hotel guest, who asked not to be named, said: 'Apparently it was quite obvious to the paramedics and police who were called that they intended to commit suicide.

'We have been told that they were a fairly local couple and that both were very ill - the woman more seriously so than the man.

'We were told that there was a lot of paraphernalia around in the room and also a note explaining what they were doing.

'I guess all the details will come out in the inquest into their deaths.'

Other guests checking out of the five-star hotel today spoke of their shock at the incident.

A man aged in his 50s, who was staying at the hotel while in Reading on business, said: 'It is just shocking and so sad. I only checked in last night, so I missed the emergency services but I read about what happened.

'I really feel for them, it is just tragic that they felt they could not go on.'

The luxury hotel boasts of 'an indulgent and relaxing experience' on its website (pictured). Rooms cost up to £350-a-night and each comes complete with Egyptian cotton sheets and complementary branded toiletries

A 35-year-old man, who works in the area, added: 'I saw all the police cars and ambulances here yesterday as I only work around the corner. I actually thought someone had been murdered.

'You just never expect something like that to happen around here and at such an upmarket hotel. I guess perhaps if it was a double suicide, they wanted to go out in style in nice surroundings, it is a lovely hotel - not to sound insensitive at all, but it is known for being among the best in the area.

'I just hope the staff who found them are okay, that must have been very traumatic.'

A woman aged in her 30s, who was at the hotel with her mother, said: 'It is such a sad tale. It is devastating to think they felt they had nothing left to live for.'

The hotel has 23 rooms and a series of 16 apartments, which it lets out.

Each room has Egyptian cotton sheets on all king size beds, with complementary Molton Brown toiletries and Nespresso coffee machines in every bedroom.

Thames Valley Police confirmed that both bodies were discovered in the same hotel room.

A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police were called to The Forbury Hotel in Forbury Square, Reading, yesterday at 2.39pm to reports of two people found dead in the hotel.

'A man in his 60s and woman in her 50s were confirmed deceased at the scene. Their next of kin have been informed.

'The deaths are currently being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. The investigation will be passed to the coroner.

'Post mortem examinations on both bodies will be carried out at the Royal Berkshire Hospital and an inquest will be opened and adjourned.

'We can confirm that the deaths are not being treated as suspicious and no-one else is being sought in connection with them.'

Inquests into the deaths are due to be opened and adjourned by the end of the week.
