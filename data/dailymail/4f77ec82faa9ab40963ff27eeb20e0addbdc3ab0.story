A new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as low doses of statins - but will cost around £1 per bowl.

Betavivo has been shown to cut high cholesterol and blood sugar levels in scientific trials.

It contains beta-glucan, a soluble fibre derived from oats which is known to positively impact on heart health.

The Swedish makers of the cereal claim that one serving a day can cut cholesterol by around 10 per cent and cut the chances of heart disease by 25 per cent.

A new oat cereal claims to reduce cholesterol levels as effectively as a low dose of statins

A bowl of Betavivo provides 3g of beta-glucan. Most healthy oat cereals contain around a quarter of this amount and porridge just a third.

Trimb Healthcare, which makes Betavivo, claims a daily bowl of the cereal for eight weeks or longer is the same as taking a 20mg dose of statins every day.

The new cereal has received approval from the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and has been welcomed by heart health charity HEART UK.

Dr Charlotta Buch, from Trimb Healthcare, said: 'Statins are a powerful drug and are effective at reducing cholesterol but our product does not have the bad side effects.

'The only side effects are positive.

'Typically the cereal can reduce cholesterol by around 10 per cent if eaten every day for more than eight weeks. This is the same as a low dose of statins.

'If you are on a higher dose, you could have the option of reducing your dose of statins and therefore reducing the chance of side effects such as muscle pain.'

Up to seven million people in the UK are on statins, costing the NHS around £450million a year.

Dr Buch added: 'The compliance rate for statins in the UK is only 50 per cent so we know patients are concerned about the side effects.

'Betavivo is scientifically proven to reduce cholesterol which is a major risk factor in heart disease.

'For those who won't take statins because of side effects, it's an all-natural alternative.

'It's also a product that's suitable for diabetics and anyone who wishes to control their blood sugar levels and is therefore at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

Beta-glucan works by dissolving in the stomach to form a gel that binds bile acids.

As the liver produces new bile acid it 'draws' cholesterol from the blood and carries these out of the body.

Beta-glucan also slows down the uptake of sugars so that insulin response is reduced after every meal.

This
 means people stay fuller for longer and are more likely to stick to a 
healthy diet without the need for snacking between meals.

Trimb
 says it uses only oats which will produce high quality beta-glucan 
molecules and then uses a process to increase the concentration of these
 in production.

Linda Main, dietitian at HEART UK, said: 'Betavivo is a cholesterol lowering product and cholesterol is a prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

'It contains 3g of beta-glucan, which is great. Porridge typically only contains 1g.

'I would say this is for people on statins who want an additional cholesterol lowering effect or for people not on statins who want to lower their cholesterol as a preventative measure.

'Potentially you might be able to lower your dose of statins by eating it and taking positive lifestyle measures.

'As you get older your cholesterol gets higher and if you are eating a product like this you may be able to avoid increasing your statins dose.'

Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, today agreed that positive dietary changes could be effective in lowering cholesterol.

However she warned against patients abandoning statins without consulting with their GP.

She said: 'It is possible for people to lower their cholesterol by changing their diet and being physically active.

'However, statins are prescribed if someone is assessed to be at significant risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

'They have been scientifically proven to reduce this risk and millions of people take them safely.

'If a person wishes to stop taking their statin they are advised to discuss the risks of doing so with their GP.'

Betavivo will be available in health 
stores and major pharmacists from September. Trimb Healthcare say it 
will cost around £1 per daily serving.
