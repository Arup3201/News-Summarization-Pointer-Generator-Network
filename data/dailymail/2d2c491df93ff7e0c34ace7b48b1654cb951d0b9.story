Keeping skin moist, women are so often told, is the key to staying young.

But working out when your skin is thirsty and needs a boost is far from simple.

Now scientists have come up with an ingenious new ‘pen’ which claims to help the beauty conscious prevent the onset of aging.

The £75 Hydrapen works by sending a small electrical current onto the skin, which determines the level of oil and moisture in the tissue

The HydraTest device measures oil and hydration levels in just five seconds, delivering a personalised ‘skin prescription’ to the user and prompting them to treat dehydrated skin.

It works by sending a small electrical current onto the skin, which cannot be felt by the user, but the amount of resistance to the current determines the level of oil and moisture in the tissue.

The digital screen shows a percentage read-out, which can then be cross-referenced with a small credit card sized information card. This includes a moisture sliding scale, with 30 per cent or less meaning the skin is dehydrated, 31 to 35 per cent indicating dry skin, 36 to 46 per cent for normal skin and 47 per cent or indicating a high moisture content.

The pen also measures oil levels at the same time, using bars similar to reception levels on a mobile phone, ranging from one, meaning low oil, to four or five bars, meaning high oil content, on the digital display.

Ibs Ansari, director of BeautyPro, which manufactures the pen, said it was the first pocket-sized device, based on salon technology, of its type to measure skin moisture levels in real-time.

‘The two prongs on the analyser send a slight electrical current to the skin,’ he said. ‘Anyone who uses it won’t feel this current, because it is so small, but the amount of resistance to the current is used to determine the amount of moisture and oil in the skin tissues.

‘The pen will enable individual women – and men – to assess their skin problems accurately at home or on the go for the first time and, more importantly, tailor a skin care regime for themselves. It also allows users to monitor progress to see how their skin is improving.’

The pen, which weighs around 40g, and is as big as a standard pencil, is portable and powered by a single AAA battery – enough to deliver around 1,000 readings.

It has already proved a hit with those working in the beauty industry and early sales indications are it is also proving popular with the general public after being launched in Harvey Nichols stores last month.

One mobile beauty therapist said: ‘This is such a handy addition to the services I offer. I use it at the beginning and the end of a treatment to show the difference it has made. It also means I can better tailor products I use on clients and has also increased my after sales.’

Costing £75 it is available from Harvey Nichols or can be bought online.
