How many Frenchmen can you fit on a Ford Focus? Well, rather a lot it turns out, if they are very drunk and very excited.

Hooliganism may once have been the sole property of English football, but it appears French BMX and skateboarding fans aren't shy of a spot of wanton destruction either.

Dozens of drunk and overexcited extreme sports fans brought an area of central Montpellier, France, to a standstill last night after spilling out of the city's famous FISE festival, attacking cars that stood in their way.

Footage 
obtained by MailOnline shows one group of revellers turning their 
testosterone on an innocent hatchback as it tried to cross the Juvenal 
bridge in the centre of the city.
