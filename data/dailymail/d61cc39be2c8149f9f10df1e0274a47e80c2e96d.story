This is the moment a pensioner hurled his next-door neighbour over a garden fence and tried to gouge out his eyes - after a row over a parking space.

Highways inspector Harry Ferris, 65, even head-butted his neighbour's 64-year-old wife because she threw a hose near a connecting fence whilst showing her friend a rockery.

Victims Tilly and Philip Hellawell have today revealed they were terrified of Ferris from the moment he moved into the farmhouse next-door which overlooks the Pennines in the scenic town of Bacup, Lancashire.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard the chaos started just days after 18-stone Ferris and his wife arrived in April 2012. 

The court heard that the Hellawells were regularly on the end of four-letter tirades concerning parking, their shared garden gate and alleged dog mess.

Events reached their climax on Christmas Eve last year after several months of incidents when Ferris, a director of a highways construction firm, lunged at retired company director Mr Hellawell, 67, as he was repairing a gate between the two properties.

On CCTV played in court Ferris could be heard to shout, 'you put your hands on me once more and you'll be dead - and I mean dead', in between a torrent of foul language.

Mr Hellawell - who has lived in his  property with his wife since 1986 - was then punched and hurled over the fence where he was left battered and bloody.

All he can be heard doing in retaliation is asking for mercy in 'the season of pleasantries'.

After being convicted of two counts of assault following a trial, Ferris escaped with just a fine, which included having to pay £200 in compensation to the Hellawells.

He was also fined £480 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £48 as well as prosecution costs of £200 - a total of £928 - which he will pay in two installments over two months.

Chair of the bench Alan Ravenscroft said that a restraining order would be inappropriate as it would be impossible to implement with the complainants being next-door neighbours.

He said: 'With Mr Hellawell it was an ongoing assault where he was picked up and put over a fence. The main purpose of this sentence today is one of punishment.

'Mrs Hellawell received very minor injuries and some distress. Mr Hellawell received cuts, bruises, a torn shirt and distress.'

Outside court Ferris attempted to intimidate photographers and remained defiant that the events were tit-for-tat, insisting that he was the one being harassed by neighbours.

During his earlier trial, CCTV footage was played which showed Ferris exploding at 4ft 7ins Mrs Hellawell when she accidentally threw a hosepipe over their connecting gate on August 26 last year.

He then unleashed a string of four-letter obscenities and thrust his head towards her face. She escaped with minor injury.

Mrs Hellawell, who also used to breed greyhounds, said the problems started when Ferris began parking his car in their yard.

She said: 'The car park or yard is quite large but it was not when we first moved in. So after a considerable cost to us, in the tens of thousands, we made it bigger so we had room for our cars and the cars of our staff at the time.

'When we arrived it was just a narrow rutted lane and no two vehicles could pass each other. It is now considerably bigger than it was. So a week in I went to see him about it. I have before allowed neighbours to park in it.

Flash point: CCTV footage played in court also showed the moment Harry Ferris, right, attacked his neighbout Tilly Hellawell, left, because she threw a hose near a connecting fence whilst showing her friend a rockery

'I saw his car and thought "hang on, he has his own car on there." There were also his contractor's vehicles there everyday - two or three at any given time.

'They were having work and construction done all the time. I thought, "well he hasn't even asked to use the yard". That is where it all started.'

The couple also claim that before events reached a climax on Christmas Eve, the Ferris' took exception to their two dogs - Bob and Ellie - and tried to open the shared gates so the dogs would run out into the road. 

At his sentencing hearing, Ferris' solicitor Brian Koffman said the defendant felt he was constantly provoked but now knew 'not to rise to it'.

Earlier, Ferris, who has no previous convictions, said Mr Hellawell had an 'obsessional' interest in his own security - with CCTV cameras fitted around his property and audio capture equipment installed at different locations.

He was also said to carry around a dictation machine wherever he went.

But the surveillance technology captured the moment Ferris set upon Mrs Hellawell, which her husband described as 'disturbing'.

He said: 'My wife had had a friend over and was showing her the rockery. She saw that they the plants needed watering and went to get the hose. He came storming out, apparently because my wife had shut his gate so the dogs didn't run through.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard that the chaos started just days after 18-stone Harry Ferris and his wife arrived at the property in April 2012 

'My wife is tiny and he just towered over her. He was shouting at her and then walked away and came back and head butted her. I feel so helpless as her husband that I wasn't there and couldn't have protected her.

'I kept thinking if I was any sort of a man I would go and punch his lights out but then reality set in. 

'He is so much bigger than me, I mean he used to be a builder and combating violence with violence would not have done anyone favours. 

'My wife had a headache the next day. She went into a bit of a white mist. She didn't even dial 999 - that's how out of sorts she was.'

Defending Ferris - who wore dark prescription sunglasses throughout his sentencing - Mr Koffman said he was a courteous and civil person, except when he gets upset about these 'particular issues'.

'He and his wife are in their 60s and are looking forward to retirement. This is a very unfortunate blemish on his character. He is a man who has never done anything wrong in his life.

'If he feels provoked he shouldn't rise to it. It boils down to a man and a lady who wanted to live their lives and don't feel they can because they are being harassed.

'The house is very attractive and it was supposed to be peaceful but it hasn't turned out like that.'
