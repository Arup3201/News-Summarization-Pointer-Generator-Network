And he wonders why it is always him. Just when you thought you had seen it all with Mario Balotelli, he takes the breath away on Anfield’s biggest European night in five years.

With Liverpool submerging at half-time, the evening having become an exercise in damage limitation rather than one to tell the grandchildren about as they trailed 3-0, Balotelli decided to swap shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe as he sauntered off towards the dressing room.

Not clever. Not clever at all. Having endured a dismal, uncomfortable start to his time on Merseyside, Balotelli had a glorious chance to show why Brendan Rodgers took a £16million gamble on him in August and made him a Liverpool player.

Instead, after barely breaking into a canter and never threatening Madrid’s goal, Balotelli managed to enrage two former Liverpool captains - both of whom had lifted the European Cup - and seemingly lose the trust of his manager.

‘What is going on?’ said Phil Thompson, Liverpool skipper when they beat Real Madrid in the 1981 final in Paris, when learning of Balotelli’s faux pas. ‘Are you joking? Oh my goodness. What is in his mind to do that? He’s having a difficult time as it is.

‘I don’t care whether you’re playing for Liverpool or a Second Division club, you don’t do things like that. It’s disrespectful. That is absolutely dreadful from a Liverpool player. He is lucky to be wearing one, to be playing, the way he’s been playing before. And he gives it away at half-time?’

Meanwhile, Graeme Souness, who captained the Reds when they lifted the trophy by beating Roma in 1984, was simmering with rage in Sky’s Anfield studio, growling: ‘Don’t get me started.’

When Thompson and Souness were leading Liverpool, they guarded that red jersey with their lives. They went to war wearing it in far, foreign lands and would not accept anything but the absolute maximum from those around them. Each time they pulled it on was a privilege.

Some will no doubt dismiss the shirt-swapping as trivial, another Balotelli eccentricity. Yet the main issue for Rodgers is not the souvenir he collected but what the Italy striker produced in the 45 minutes before his game was curtailed for what were described as 'tactical’ reasons.

On the touchline, as Liverpool made a bright start, Rodgers urged Balotelli to press, mouthing the words ‘keep getting into the box’.

Liverpool’s manager had said this fixture had the potential to ‘create legends’ - and a Balotelli winner would have sent him on that road.

But Rodgers got nothing back from the Italian. Again. Rodgers had faith in his own ability to unlock the talent lurking inside Balotelli and was adamant that the player would seize the opportunity given to him as the transfer deadline loomed in August.

Instead, all Rodgers has had since is aggravation. Bar one goal against Ludogorets, Balotelli has not once threatened to show he can be a Liverpool player. He simply does not fit the brand of football the manager wants to play and one wonders how this experiment can work.

Where does Balotelli go from here? Taking him off after 45 minutes in a game of this magnitude shows that Rodgers does not trust him and another incident bringing more negative PR, after the player's failure to applaud the travelling fans in Basle, is a headache the manager can surely do without.

Do not believe, however, that Balotelli - who again refused to talk in the mixed zone as he headed for home with Pepe's shirt stuffed in a clear plastic bag - was the reason Liverpool were flattened. He should not be made a scapegoat.

Here’s why: the six attacking players Carlo Ancelotti unleashed on Liverpool cost Real Madrid £271million.

Recruiting the most exciting forwards on the planet does not come cheap but the logic is clear: bringing in those with the gifts of Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez et al  enables Madrid to play a brand of football that almost guarantees goals in the tightest contests.

Yet Ancelotti could have spent £271 on new signings to score two of the three goals Liverpool shipped to Karim Benzema. If Balotelli is giving Rodgers problems up front, his defenders are causing even more concern. The issues are mounting.
