This is unlikely to be what the occupants of this narrowboat had in mind when they hired the vessel for a peaceful cruise along the River Nene.

Two people were forced to leap to safety on the banks after the 14 tonne boat smashed into a sluice gate amid strong flows on the river in Northamptonshire, the Environment Agency said.

The boaters had taken to the water despite a hazard warning in place in light of high flows on the river.

Wedged: The boat smashed into the sluice gate after the occupants lost control of the vessel in high flows on the River Nene, the Environment Agency said

The occupants lost control of the 60ft vessel in the fast-flowing water near Ditchford on Thursday afternoon and the boat crashed into the sluice gate.

The Environment Agency said it had issued a strong stream advice warning ahead of the incident, which left the partially sunk vessel severely damaged.

The boaters were able to disembark safely and were not injured.

The owner of the boat has arranged for it to be recovered from the river.

'We would recommend every boater to sign up for the Strong Stream Advice service, and to take the warnings very seriously indeed when they are issued,' an Environment Agency spokesman said.

'If there is a strong stream, we will call you free of charge to advise you not to go out on the river.

'The free warning is sent to any boaters who sign up for the service when flows reach a level that could be hazardous to boaters.

'Noticeboards are displayed prominently on the riverbanks to inform boaters of the status of the river and red flags are also raised at several boat clubs,' the spokesman added.
