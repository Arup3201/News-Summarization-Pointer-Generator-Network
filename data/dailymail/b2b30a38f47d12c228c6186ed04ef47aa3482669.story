For many people living in towns and cities, growing flowers, fruits or vegetables is out of the question.

But a team of inventors from San Francisco has unveiled a device that makes it possible, via an indoor greenhouse that can be controlled by a smartphone.

By connecting their phone to the greenhouse, people will be able to grow fruit and vegetables in their homes without needing access to a garden.

A team in San Francisco has invented the world's first greenhouse that can be controlled by a smartphone (shown) - so wannabe gardeners can grow fruit and veg in their own homes.
The indoor gadget boasts a built-in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth

The device uses a fully automated hydroponic system, with sensors and actuators, to simulate real environmental conditions.

To start growing, a user just tells the app what sort of plant has been selected.

A programme specific to that plant will then load, initiating a lighting and irrigation sequence and the right conditions for the type of plant and its stage of growth.

As it grows, the app will ask for feedback, for example, ‘can you see any leaves?’

The software will then adjust its settings based on this feedback to provide an even better environment for your plant to thrive.

The company claims you can grow almost anything that will fit in the tray.

This includes house plants, flowers, vegetables, several kinds of fruits and various herbs.

However you can’t grow root vegetables just yet, although this will be available in the near future.

In a week the standard sized greenhouse can grow three to five tomatoes, two to three peppers and one lettuce at peak function.

The indoor gadget uses a built-in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth.

The glass-sided device uses special sensors to pick up these readings, which then automatically activate different parts of the machine.

And the device warms up, cools down, turns on a light or waters the plants autonomously without input from the user.

The contraption, called Niwa, can be used to grow flowers, fruits, vegetables or herbs.

It will come in three sizes and is delivered in an easy-to-assemble kit.

Once a user has planted their desired seeds they simply choose which crop it is from a list on the Niwa smartphone app.

The machine then adjusts the settings to match the requirements for that specific plant.

Niwa is the brainchild of San Francisco pair Javier Morillias, 32, and Agnieszka Nazaruk, 27.

Mr Morillias said: 'I kept seeing trucks filled with different vegetables ready to be delivered to various countries and it made no sense to me.

'I started wondering what happened, why the production had gone that far from the consumer.

'The answer I found was because we just can't grow them ourselves because of the lack of time, space, conditions or skills.

'I decided to start using technology to make the whole process simple and to enable everyone to grow their own food wherever they are.'

Upon release in January 2015 it is expected a mini version will cost around £176 ($299), the standard about £205 ($349) and the premium about £235 ($399)

He continued that they wanted to aim the product at city dwellers who have no time or space, yet still want to be 'green'.  

'Niwa is based in hydroponic technology, which is a soil-less way to grow plants, where the plant takes nutrients directly from the water,' he said.

'The Niwa controls the temperature, humidity, and light cycles and the automated irrigation system will also water and feed your plants whenever they need it.

'It is connected to the internet and there is a smartphone app that sets the right growing variables according to your chosen plant.

'With hydroponics and our current range of sizes, you can grow just about anything that will fit inside the tray, apart from trees and root vegetables.'

The team behind Niwa raised about £91,000 ($151,000 dollars) on crowdfunding website Kickstarter.
