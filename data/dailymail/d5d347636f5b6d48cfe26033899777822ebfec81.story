Ann Hughes was cleared of 'excessive' behaviour after asking a policeman to speak to pupils about their refusal to smile for a school photograph

A headteacher was yesterday cleared of ‘excessive’ behaviour after asking a policeman to speak to pupils about their refusal to smile for a school photograph.

Ann Hughes, head of Ysgol Goronwy Owen, a village primary school at Benllech, Anglesey,  asked PC Brian Jones to speak to the whole class about their behaviour.

But the General Teaching Council for Wales said he would have been  well-known to the children as a liaison officer at the village primary.

Jacquie Turnbull, chairman of the GTCW’s professional conduct committee, said the policeman was invited to speak to the whole class about their behaviour rather than individual pupils.

The chairwoman said: 'We accept pupils became upset when he expressed his disappointment in their behaviour.

'This might have been because they interpreted this as a reprimand.

'This wasn’t a request to reprimand particular pupils,' the chairwoman declared, finding the allegation not proved.

She was also cleared of calling a pupil 'twp' - the Welsh term for 'stupid,' criticising his error in spelling his middle name, and ripping up his SATs examination paper in his presence.

The panel also found unproved a complaint that Mrs Hughes failed to show proper sensitivity to a boy after the death of his father, favoured Welsh speakers, highlighted parents’ complaints during school assembly, and engaged in excessive criticism of a pupil about his response to her use of the term 'crap.'

But Mrs Hugheswas found guilty of “unacceptable professional conduct” because of some other complaints against her.

The panel accepted that she failed to ensure there was effective communication within the school including a clear understanding of staff roles and responsibilities in her absence, and that Mrs Hughes failed to maintain a cooperative working relationship among staff.

The school had been engulfed in crisis in May 2011 when five of the six teachers called in sick on the same day after earlier threatening industrial action following a declaration of no confidence in Mrs Hughes.

They claimed there was a 'climate of fear.'

The committee chairwoman said: 'We noted the exceptionally difficult circumstances in the school which had been deteriorating since the deletion of the deputy headteacher’s post.'

Mrs Hughes’s barrister Annette Gumbs urged that there should be no disciplinary order.

She said: 'The exceptional circumstances here are the very fact of the very difficult circumstances that existed in the face of five teachers who had set their face against her.'

Counsel said: 'She is passionate about children and the care of children and their education.'

Miss Gumbs remarked: 'She was faced with a campaign for her dismissal. Despite difficult times she was able to maintain the standards in the school.'

She had sought support from the education authority and chairman of governors. Mrs Hughes had spent 36 years teaching
