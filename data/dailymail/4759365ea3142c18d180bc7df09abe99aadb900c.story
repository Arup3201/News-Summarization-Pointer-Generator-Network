This is the emotional moment a U.S. Marine who spent 214 days languishing in a Mexican jail after 'accidentally' crossing the border with three loaded guns was reunited with his mother.

Retired sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, was set free from a facility in Tecate, a border town just south of California, on Friday night after a Mexican judge decided to drop the case.

He had been imprisoned for nearly seven months after getting lost on the freeway with three weapons in his pick-up truck and finding himself with no way back into the United States.

Donning a dark green jacket, he was quickly processed through immigration, before boarding a private jet to a South Florida airport, where he was met on the tarmac by his beaming mother, Jill.

Serviceman: The retired sergeant had been imprisoned for more than eight months after getting lost on the freeway with three weapons in his pick-up truck and finding himself with no way back into the U.S.

The pair were captured flinging their arms around each other in joy following the plane's arrival at 6am on Saturday. They are now resting and catching up at the family home in suburban Weston.

'He was happy. He was smiling. He's looking good. His spirits are high,'  Bill Richardson, ex-governor of New Mexico, who made a strong diplomatic push for Tahmooressi's release, told Fox News.

Speaking on Friday night, a family spokesman said: 'It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican Jail.' 

The Marine, an American veteran of the war in Afghanistan who left the U.S. Marines in 2012, is now expected to undergo treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Tahmooressi was arrested on March 31 by custom agents at the San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana after arriving there in his truck. He was charged with weapons offenses.

Had he been convicted for violating Mexican gun laws he could have faced 21 years behind bars.  

Tahmooressi's long detention brought calls for his freedom from U.S. politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. 

American lawmakers even took the unusual step of scheduling a House of Representatives hearing during a congressional recess in the hope of putting pressure on Mexico and on President Barack Obama's administration to intervene more urgently in the case.

Mrs Tahmooressi said her son's time in jail was worse than his two tours of Afghanistan. She added the veteranhad  left Florida for San Diego in January to get help after dropping out of college, unable to concentrate or sleep.

In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening border checks to stop the flow of U.S. weapons  used by drug cartels.

Tahmooressi's attorney, Fernando Benitez, said he had the loaded guns with him because the weapons, which were bought legally in the U.S., make him feel safer.

He is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost, Benitez said.

But Mexican prosecutors insist Tahmooressi broke the law, and have denied claims that he was held for about eight hours without a translator before authorities notified the U.S. Consulate.

A psychiatrist hired by Mexican prosecutors to examine the Afghanistan veteran agreed with the defense that he should get PTSD treatment in the United States, noting in a September 30 report that Tahmooressi, who now serves in the Marine reserve, feels constantly in danger.

Tahmooressi did not admit wrongdoing, and maintains his innocence. The judge freed him without deciding whether or not he had committed a crime. 

The release followed a meeting between Mr Richardson  and Reps. Ed Royce and Matt Salmon with Mexico's Attorney General and Ambassador to the U.S. 

Protests: American veterans, pictured outside the White House last week, took to the streets demanding the released of Sgt Tahmooressi

U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., was among those to applaud Tahmooressi's release.

'As a mother, my heart is with Jill Tahmooressi tonight and I can only imagine the many emotions she must be experiencing,' she said on Friday.

'Namely the relief in knowing her son is coming home and that they will soon be reunited without prison bars, without handlers and without unnecessary travel.'
