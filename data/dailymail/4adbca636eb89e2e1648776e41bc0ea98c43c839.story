This is the moment a man discovered a swarm of 15,000 bees were using his boiler as their hive.

Colin Burbridge, 45, called a local workman when his central heating system stopped working just five months after being installed at his company's office in Littleport, Cambridgeshire.

But after opening up the boiler, the pair were stunned to find it was infested with thousands of bees.

Mr Burbridge, who immediately fled the office after being stung, was forced to call on local beekeeper Stuart Palmer, 41, and his 39-year-old wife, Carol, to tackle the infestation.

Donning protective white suits and parcel tape around their wrists and ankles, the couple managed to safely remove the colony by encouraging them into a nucleus box.

Today, Mr Burbridge, who runs the heating engineering firm M8trix, said he had not noticed the bees' buzzing because the boiler in his office's kitchen area had 'sealed in' the noise.

'I was standing next to the boiler when it was opened,' he said. 'I got stung straight away and just fled the building.

'It is a new boiler and all the noise is sealed in so I didn't hear any buzzing or anything like that.

'We are an engineering firm as well so you can imagine there is a lot of noise.'

Mr Burbridge added that the swarm of insects had destroyed his £2,000 boiler, which he might have to pay for out of his own pocket.

'We are not covered by our insurers on this because it is an "insect infestation",' he said.

'It was a new boiler and cost about £2,000 but hopefully we won't have to pay that out again.'

Taking them away: Mr Palmer tips some of the insects into a box, while hundreds of others are on the floor

Mrs Palmer who had passed a beekeeping course just a week before the infestation was discovered, said the swarm of bees had likely entered the boiler through an outside vent.

'There is a vent at the back of the boiler that goes outside and that must be how they managed to get in,' she said.

'I asked for a bit of advice from more experienced beekeepers. They advised that we cut out the comb from inside the boiler and encourage the bees to move away.

'Fortunately, we were able to attract the vast majority into a nucleus box and they are now sitting happily in our garden waiting to be transferred to their new hive.

'They had basically made their own hive. They were happy there until we came and got them out.

'Having a suit on and parcel tape around my ankles and wrists gives you that little sense of bravery.'

She added that after she and her husband had left M8trix, staff had been left with a huge clean-up job on their hands.

'There was a lot of honey in there so it was a bit of a sticky job,' she said.
