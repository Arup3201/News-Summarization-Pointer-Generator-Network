A Virginia singleton decided to take a chance on romance for 2014, launching a poster campaign to find a man named Ben who she spent hours chatting to at a bar just before Christmas.

Courtney plastered posters all over Old Town Alexandria in an effort that quickly went viral, with supporters of the romantic search tweeting pictures of her poster with the hash tag '#FindBen.'

Courtney says she and Ben met at The Light Horse bar and restaurant in Old Town Alexandria on December 23.

Her search paid off today, with a final tweet from her OldTownCourtney Twitter account: 'I found Ben!'

The pair had chatted for hours about 
'religion, faith, morality, culture, and how do you define culture in a 
society - definitely not the things you just randomly talk to someone 
about it a bar,' she told Fox 5.

'It was an extensive conversation in the middle of a DJ playing, a hundred people dancing all around us.'

Courtney left the bar with friends without giving her phone number to Ben - and later regretted it.

'Moral of the story - take a chance and get the guy's number or else you end up posting signs in #OldTownAlexandria #FindBen #NYE #leapoffaith,' she tweeted on December 31.

Not knowing Ben's surname or address,
 Courtney decided to find Ben the old-fashioned way, and printed out 
posters that read, 'Ben (from the Light Horse), I made the wrong choice 
on December 23rd. Call me! Courtney' along with her phone number. 

'So I printed off about 75 and I think I got about 60 up, all down King st,' she laughed.

Online love: While Courtney's initial campaign was low-fi posters, it soon went viral online, with people posting pictures of her posters to Twitter with the hashtag #FindBen

Wanted: Courtney plastered posters all over Old Town Alexandria searching for Ben

'He is probably early to mid-30s, white male with brown hair, beard, brown eyes, average build, slightly athletic,' she told Fox 5 of her crush.

Although Courtney's campaign began in the old-fashioned way, with pen and paper, it quickly went viral online, with local residents taking photos of her posters and imploring friends and followers to help Courtney #FindBen.

Many romantics were avidly watching the story unfold hoping for a New Year's Eve midnight reunion, but no such luck.

'No Ben! :-( happy new year!' she tweeted that evening. 

Courtney had plenty of phone calls, voicemails and text messages that night - but none of them were from Ben, and most were people trying to find out if Courtney had made contact with Ben.

'I had 65 calls, 22 voicemails and more than 30 texts yesterday. And i still can't #FindBen,' she tweeted on December 1.

Many local restaurants, captivated by the story, offered Courtney a free dinner date if she managed to track down Ben.

The finally, just as she must have been beginning to lose hope, Courtney found Ben.

'I found Ben! To respect Ben’s privacy, I won’t be taking any more interviews. Thank you everyone for the support in my quest to #FindBen !!!' she tweeted less than an hour ago.
