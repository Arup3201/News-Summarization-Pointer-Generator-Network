The European Championships get underway in Zurich on Tuesday and Sportsmail has compiled a list of Britain's medal hopes.

Women's 400m round one - Tuesday 12th - 17.00 (BST)

Christine Ohuruogu begins her campaign to capture the one major title that has eluded her - European gold. 

The reigning World Champion admitted to doubts about whether she was in shape to win but her credentials mean she will go in as favourite.

Final piece of the jigsaw: Christine Ohuruogu has her sights set on the 400m title

Getting back on track: Mo Farah will look to put his recent illness behind him in the Men's 10,000m

Men’s 10,000m final - Wednesday 13th – 18.50 (BST) 

After pulling out of the Commonwealth Games, Mo Farah – who withdrew because of abdominal pains - has a chance to prove his fitness and get his season back on track against a weaker field than he would have faced in Glasgow. Farah is also expected to run in the 5,000m.

Women’s 200m final – Friday 15th – 19.25 (BST) 

Jodie Williams is ranked second in Europe behind Dutch heptathlon star Daphne Schippers. Former junior star Williams, who won Commonwealth silver last month, has hit form at the right time after being plagued with injury for two years.

Silver lining: Commonwealth Games medallists Jodie Williams and Adam Gemili will hope to go one better

Men’s 200m final – Friday 15th – 20.50 (BST) 

Adam Gemili wasn’t selected for the 100m team, the event he won Commonwealth silver in, so all his energy will be focussed on the 200m, where he is joint favourite for the title alongside reigning Champion Christophe Lemaitre of France.

Men’s long jump final – Sunday 17th – 15.00 (BST)

Greg Rutherford predicted he may have to break his own record of 8.51 metres if he is to add a European title to Olympic and Commonwealth glory. 

The quick track at Zurich’s Letzigrund stadium and competition from world champion Aleksandr Menkov should will propel Rutherford.

Going the distance: Greg Rutherford reckons he needs to break his own record in the long jump

Women's high jump final - Sunday 17th - 14.15 (BST)

Morgan Lake is only 17 and the youngest athlete of any nationality at the European Championships. Fresh from winning two golds at the World Junior Championships, she will focus on the high jump here. 

The 1.93m personal best she set in Oregon last month would have been enough for bronze two years ago so a medal is within her reach.

Women's 800m final - Saturday 16th - 15.05 (BST)

Scotland's darling of the track Lynsey Sharp, who won silver in Glasgow despite being hooked up to a drip hours earlier, will go up against teammates, 19 year old Jess Judd and Eildh Child who is number one in Europe this year.
