Tampa police have taken on the role of Santa and delivered gifts to two children after thieves broke into their home and stole their presents.

When single mother Melody Russell returned from work the day before Christmas Eve, she found her back door open and her children's presents - and 12-week-old puppy - gone.

Police haven't been able to find Honey the puppy yet, but about 20 officers and dispatchers clubbed together to replace the missing gifts.

The replacement gifts for Marissa, 7, and Marcus, 5, were delivered on Christmas Eve in a move that left 33-year-old Ms Russell overwhelmed.

'I couldn't stop smiling. I didn't have words,' she told the Tampa Bay Times.

District supervisor Lieutenant Yvette Flynn said she was proud of her team's efforts.

'We get really familiar with the 
community. These are our families and children out there,' she said. The last thing
 in the world we want is to have one of our families burglarized at 
Christmas and for kids to go without gifts. The officers take it to 
heart.'

The children will now have gifts to open on Christmas morning, but they are still missing their Shih Tzu dog that went missing during the break in.Â 

Police kept an eye out for the puppy,
 which hadn't been microchipped because it was too young, while out on 
patrol on Christmas Eve.

'My kids are so in love with that puppy,' Ms Russell told The Detroit News.

She said her daughter cried for half an hour when she was told the dog had gone missing.

The property manager said she had been left devastated by the break in and was sat in her living room praying for strength, when she got a call from police to say they were going to drop the presents off.

Each gift was hand-delivered and signed 'From Santa.

'Every single one of them had gifts in their hands. I was so in shock,' she said.
