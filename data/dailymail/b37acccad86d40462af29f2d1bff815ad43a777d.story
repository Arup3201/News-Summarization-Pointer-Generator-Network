Being afraid of getting old is a common complaint among both men and women in modern society.

But while most people might try and slow down the process with the odd pot of anti-ageing serum, one 59-year-old housewife from Norfolk is so terrified of ageing that she has spent over £50,000 on 60 operations in a bid to completely halt the process.

Explaining herself, Linda Briggs said: 'I don't want to look old and I'll do whatever necessary to stop the process.

Growing old disgracefully: Linda says she's prepared to do whatever it takes to keep her youthful looks

'A friend of my sister's came up to me at her wedding and asked me if I was her mother. I didn't react at the time, although I wanted to kill her, but when I got home I looked in the mirror and asked myself why she might think think I was sister's mother.'

Linda examined her face closely: 'I thought to myself, yes, you've got a turkey neck, lines like the Grand Canyon and centipedes round the eyes. I screamed and cried and thought, yes, time for a facelift!'

She began her bid for youth and beauty with an upper and lower eyelid reduction and a partial facelift and since the first surgery in 1999, has had more than 50 procedures.

'It was about six months later [after the first operation] that I started to feel better and thought "yes, I can deal with this",' she explains, adding: 'It's changed my life beyond recognition.'

Natural: Linda says she won't have extreme surgery because she wants a naturally youthful look

'I think I now appreciate the things that can be tamed with cosmetic surgery and that makes me less willing to tolerate things I don't like. If it's easy and I can go and do it, then I will go and do it.'Her next operation is a breast lift and she's planning to travel to Paris to get the perfect perky pair.

'The distance doesn't come into it really,' she reveals. 'I just need the boobs!

She continued: I think my boobs look quite old at the 
moment, they're not as saggy as some I've seen but they do look like 
they're getting on towards 60, which I will be on my next birthday.

'To 
have the boobs of a 29-year-old would be a bonus.'

Appearing in Channel 5 documentary, 200 Nips and Tucks and I Want More, Linda is seen travelling to the French capital for the operation.

'If the surgery works, I will definitely 
be going braless on my 60th birthday,' she reveals. 'My friends and family will think 
I'm a bit of a tart but I don't care!

'I will buy a nice silk dress and 
wear nothing underneath. I'm very blase about the operation and I don't get worried
 about it because I know I've spent time choosing the right surgeon, 
anaesthetic, clinic and everything else.'

After the operation, Linda is seen inspecting her new breasts which, much to her delight, are just what she'd hoped for.

Happier: Linda says her ultimate triumph will come when she's a gorgeous corpse in her coffin

'All of me probably looks about 45 but my 
boobs are 30,' she burbles. 'I don't think people can tell I've had surgery because I try to keep it natural.

She adds: 'I will never grow old gracefully - I will grow old as disgracefully as I possibly can. I don't think I have an addiction.

'If there's something I 
don't like about myself, I will have it corrected. That's not an 
addiction. The ultimate triumph for me will be when I'm a good-looking 
corpse!'
