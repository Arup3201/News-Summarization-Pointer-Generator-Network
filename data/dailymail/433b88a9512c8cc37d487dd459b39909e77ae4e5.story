Etan Patz's mother has described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago at his alleged killer's murder trial.

Julie Patz, 72, came face-to-face with Pedro Hernandez, the former shop worker accused of killing the six-year-old boy, when she testified at Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday.

She told the jury the youngster was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when describing her feelings when she realized her son was missing.

Her testimony is the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened.

Tesitimony: Julie Patz, mother of Etan Patz, (pictured arriving at court) told said her son was 'trusting' and terrified of being alone as she took to the stand at his alleged killer's murder trial in Manhattan 

Emotional: Mrs Patz (pictured with an attorney outside the New York court) broke into tears when she described the moment she realized her son was missing in May 1979. She arrived separately from other family members

She arrived at the court separately for her husband Stan, who turned up with his daughter Shira, and was not wearing a wedding ring.  

Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little. Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979 — the first time he walked to school alone.

'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.'

Etan had asked his mother if he could walk to catch the school bus on his own. She initially said no but capitulated. On the day he went missing she told him to go straight to the bodega and get a drink with money he had been saving up. 

'I reminded him to come directly home from school, no side trips anywhere,' she said. 

She told the court how the store, where Hernandez worked as a youngster, was dark, dirty and poorly stocked. However because of the location other parents in the neighborhood would often tell the children to meet there in an emergency.

Hernandez said in his videotaped confession that he lured the youngster into the basement of the store and strangled him.  

His parents were looking after two other toddlers that morning - their two-year-old son Ari and a neighbor's chilled. Their daughter Shira, who was eight at the time, also decided to stay home from school.  

The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.'

But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.'

Mrs Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing.

'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking.

'Our home became police headquarters. Global command. It was very strange.' 

'It was not fun,' she added. 'Our children were handed off to neighbors and friends because our house was a madhouse. It’s been more like a circus than anything else.' 

Asking questions from prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, she said women in her neighborhood criticized her for playing and laughing with her children just months after Etan vanished - suggesting she was somehow involved. 

She also became emotional when she started describing the impact the case which has spanned three decades has had on her children.

'My daughter and my son, this has been almost their entire lives,' she said. 'It's very difficult to continuously try to regain a sense of normalcy in your daily life (while having it) constantly being pulled out from under you with new developments in the case, new leads or whatever,' she said. 

She then spoke about the role she played in pushing the issue of missing children into the spotlight, saying she initially hadn't meant for it to happen.

'This was not my intention, but the opportunity arose as more and more parents of missing children called me and asked me, 'How do you do it? How do you keep going?'' she said. 

'I would talk to them. I started doing talk shows around the country, both to encourage political change in how this country addressed missing children.'

After the coverage surrounding her son's disappearance died down in the 1980's she shied away from the spotlight. Her husband Stan started making most of the appearances in public. 

She has only been seen at a handful of court dates. 

Donna Cornachio, a professor of journalism at Purchase College,  also took to the stand. She was helping Mrs Patz run her daycare when Etan went missing.

She told the court that the mother started panicking on the day and said over and over: 'Etan should be home by now. Etan should be home by now.'   

Hernandez was a teenage shop worker in 1979 when New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search.

But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s.

His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years.

In considering evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing-child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting.

Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day.

The trial is expected to last up to three months. In addition to Etan's mother, witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.

During her opening statement on Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon told the jury Etan was a 'tiny man with a big heart' who couldn't wait to walk to his school bus stop alone on the day he vanished.

The speech evoked a scene from another era, a time before cell phones or laptops, when even in New York City, children 'played outside until their mothers called them home at dinner time.'

'A time when hippies, not hipsters, graced the streets of downtown Manhattan. This is the moment we're about to step back into, and into a crime that changed the face of this city forever, a cautionary tale and a defining moment, a loss of innocence,' Illuzzi-Orbon said.

'This was the moment in time when Etan Patz lived, and it's the moment in time when Etan Patz died

'You will see and hear his chilling confession,' she added. 'What you will see is someone who very keenly controls the information that he puts out. 

Hernandez is 'a person who committed a horrible, unthinkable act, and then covered his tracks and lived the rest of his life ... always waiting and wondering when the day would come that his dark secret was out,' Illuzzi-Orbon added. 'Today is that day.'

She also mentioned how Hernandez's ex-wife, years ago, said she found a cut-out photo of Etan in a little box where he stored keepsakes.

Hernandez's brother-in-law Jose Lopez tried to alert authorities for years, the prosecutor said, calling 'America's Most Wanted,' the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the NYPD's missing-persons squad.

No one got back to him until 2012, when he called again after seeing news of a failed effort to dig for clues in a neighborhood basement.

Both Hernandez and Etan's father sat stock-still as the prosecutor spoke. Hernandez' wife, Rosemary, was also in the packed courtroom.

In repsonse, defense attorney Harvey Fishbein told the court there is no evidence from the 1979 crime scene that implicates Hernandez.
