The sight of this semi-naked man browsing a train station news stand left early-morning commuters spluttering into their cappuccinos today.

Clad only in a pair of snugly fitting white Y-fronts and sandals, the mystery man braved chilly temperatures to casually stroll into a shop at Stevenage station during the morning rush hour and buy a newspaper.

Shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their disbelief, with one posting: 'Naked man at Stevenage train station. As you do.'

'As you do': The man bought a newspaper at Stevenage train station this morning clad only in a pair of white pants and sandals

Another eye-witness tweeted: 'A man standing on the platform at Stevenage train station in only his pants is NOT how Monday should start...'

The man turned out to be a prankster from local radio station 106 Jack FM known as 'The Budgie Smuggler' - but that didn't spare the blushes of rail passengers at Stevenage, who hadn't bargained on encountering such a scantily clad specimen on their Monday morning commute.
