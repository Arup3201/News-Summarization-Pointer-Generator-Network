For those who have watched the Red Arrows display team and wondered what the view is like from the skies - wonder no more.

A three-minute video has been posted online that puts the viewer in the passenger seat of a Hawk T1 during a team practice session over their home at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.

In footage not for those of a squeamish disposition, the clip shows the Red Arrows pilot perform a series of manoeuvres at speeds of up to 450mph alongside his team mates in preparation for the start of the display season.
