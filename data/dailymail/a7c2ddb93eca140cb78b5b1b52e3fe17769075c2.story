Tens of thousands of Russians flooded Moscow city centre today to demand an end to Vladimir Putin's rule.

The crowds braved -20C (-4F) temperatures to protest a month before a presidential election Mr Putin is still expected to win.

The march - which drew 120,000 people, according to organisers - was the third mass demonstration since Mr Putin's party won a parliamentary election on December 4 with the help of what appeared to be widespread fraud.

No more hot air: Protesters storm the streets of Moscow clutching balloons and holding a banner reading, 'Russia without Putin and for fair elections!'

Cold calls: Demonstrators brave the chill to demand Putin give up ahead of the March 4 presidential polls

The election and Mr Putin's decision to reclaim the presidency proved the last straw for Russians increasingly unhappy with the creeping authoritarianism during his 12-year rule.

The rallies - which have brought together liberals, leftists and nationalists - are the biggest in Russia since the demonstrations that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 20 years ago.

Today activists wearing the white ribbons that have become the symbol of the protest movement and chanting 'Russia Without Putin' marched to a square across the river from the Kremlin to stage the rally in the freezing weather.

It appeared to be even bigger than December's protests, despite the bitter cold, in a clear statement that anti-Putin sentiment rages as strongly as ever.

Thousands of police monitored the peaceful protest, as a 5,000-strong anti-Putin protest took place simultaneously in St Petersburg, and smaller rallies were held in several dozen other cities across Russia.

A rival rally in Moscow in support of Mr Putin drew no more than 20,000 people - most of them teachers, municipal workers, employees of state-owned companies or trade union activists, who had been brought on buses provided by their employers.

The anti-Putin protests have been driven by members of the educated and urban middle class.

Mr Putin has ignored many of their demands, including for a repeat election, but has tried to assuage their anger with vague promises to introduce liberal reforms and to guarantee a fair presidential vote on March 4.

The protest leaders hope to stage another rally a week before the election to keep up the pressure on Mr Putin.

He has attempted to counter the anger
by focusing on his core support group of blue-collar workers, farmers, 
public servants and the elderly. He also has tried to discredit the 
protesters by casting their leaders as Western lackeys working to weaken
Russia.

The 
presidential race pits Mr Putin against three leaders of parliamentary 
parties who have run against him in the past, and one new opponent - the
billionaire owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, Mikhail 
Prokhorov.

Strong challenge: Vocal crowds wearing thick coats and scarves, some covering their faces with balaclavas, joined the giant rally

Public unrest: A masked demonstrator carries a poster which reads, 'Give More Power To The People, please!' as he join the ranks of disillusioned citizens

Solidarity: Several thousand demonstrators turned out in St Petersburg, some wearing paper bags over their heads to disguise their identities

Statement: Leftists carry red flags while marching to take part in the anti-Putin Moscow rally

He joined today's protest but did not take the stage.

None of the contenders is expected to pose any serious challenge to Mr Putin, whose ratings are now hovering just below the 50 per cent needed for a first-round victory.

If he fails to win an outright victory, he would face a run-off three weeks later, most likely against Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, a rival he could easily defeat.

Protesters at today's rally denounced the race as illegitimate, pointing to the tight controls Mr Putin has imposed over the political scene that have destroyed all genuine political competition.
