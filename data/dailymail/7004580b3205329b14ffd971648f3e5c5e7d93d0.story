JK Rowling told yesterday of her fierce battle to protect her children from the consequences of her fame.

The Harry Potter author said her 
family was the constant target of paparazzi and described her fury after
a journalist slipped a letter into her daughter’s schoolbag.

The mother of three told the Leveson 
Inquiry into Press standards how the  letter was hidden in the 
five-year-old’s bag at primary school.

'Hounded': JK Rowling said she felt 'under siege' from the Press after being 'driven out' of her home due to media attention

She and actress Sienna Miller gave  evidence about the impact of Press intrusion in their private lives.

Layer Cake actress Miss Miller, 29, 
told how she had falsely accused her own family and friends of betraying
her by leaking secrets about her.

Testimony: JK Rowling arrives back at her hotel last night after giving evidence into her experience of press practices at the Leveson Inquiry

She has since received £100,000 in 
damages from the News of the World after she discovered its investigator
Glenn Mulcaire had hacked her phone and emails.

Miss Rowling, 46, said she and her 
family were driven out of their home and deterred from taking family 
holidays because of the constant presence of photographers.

The multi-millionaire, who has 
previously been targeted by a stalker, said she did not want her family 
to live under an ‘invisibility cloak’, like the one used by Harry Potter
in her novels.

Miss Rowling, who gave her evidence 
using her full name Joanne Kathleen Rowling, said she had taken action 
against newspapers 50 times over breaches of privacy and misreporting, 
and had been forced to cover her children in blankets to hide them from 
photographers.

She could barely contain her fury as she described finding a letter from a journalist inside her young daughter’s bag.

‘I unzipped her schoolbag in the 
evening, and among the usual letters from school and the debris that 
every child generates, I found an envelope and a letter addressed to me 
from a journalist.

‘I can only say that I felt such a 
sense of invasion. It is very difficult to say how angry I felt that my 
five-year-old daughter’s school was no longer a place of complete 
security from journalists.’

Miss Rowling, who lives in rural 
Scotland, said she had made numerous complaints about covert photographs
of her and her children. She said she felt the Press Complaints 
Commission was inadequate. She also said her complaints to newspapers were sometimes 
ignored or treated with scorn.

However Miss Rowling agreed that newspaper publicity had helped to sell her novels and promote the subsequent films.

'Scared': Sienna Miller, pictured on her way to the inquiry yesterday morning, said she had been intimidated by press attention

Miss Miller said her personal  relationships had been damaged by her paranoia that those in her innermost circle were leaking stories about her to the News of the World.

She was catapulted to fame after beginning a relationship with Jude Law which threatened to overshadow her own acting career.

Miss Miller was ‘baffled’ about how the now defunct newspaper had obtained the information, she said, and confronted her mother, sister and two of her best friends.

‘I accused my family and people who would never dream of selling information about me,’ she told the inquiry.

She said: ‘I was 21 and I would find myself at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with ten big men chasing me.

‘The fact they had cameras meant that was legal, but if you take away the cameras you have a pack of men chasing a woman and that’s obviously a very intimidating situation.’
