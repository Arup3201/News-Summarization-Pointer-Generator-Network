An eco-conscious gardener who packed a trailer full of grass cuttings was turned away from a recycling site - because he was towing it on  a bicycle.

Retired Ray Duggleby was told by council officials that only motorised vehicles were  allowed at the site for health and safety reasons even though pedestrians were walking around.

The 66-year-old has accused the council of hypocrisy - claiming they only promote recycling when it is convenient for them.

Health and safety: Ray Duggleby, 66, was told he couldn't use facilities at a recycling site in Weel, Yorkshire, because he was using a bicycle which posed a health and safety risk

Mr Duggleby had already filled up the brown waste bin supplied by the  council for garden waste after trimming the hedges around his home in Beverley, East Yorkshire.

The keen cyclist then adapted his  trailer to fit on his bicycle so he could tow the green waste to the recycling centre in Weel, Beverley.

But he was stunned when he was told he couldn't bring his bicycle on to the site because of health and safety laws.

He said: 'I just couldn't believe it. I thought I was doing the right thing but  then they told me that "you're only allowed in if you're towing your trailer  using a car".

'They said my bike classed as a wheelbarrow, which I couldn't understand  because you don't push it.

Risk: A spokesman for East Riding of Yorkshire Council, which runs the recycling facility pictured above, said the site would be dangerous for a cyclist because it has a 'constant flow of traffic'

'I like to cycle, it's good for the 
environment and I don't believe in fly  tipping. I try to do as much as I
 can to encourage my neighbours to recycle and I  thought that the 
council wanted to be as environmentally friendly as possible.

'After this I feel as though they actually only want to recycle if it's easy  for them. It's very hypocritical of them to pretend they are in support of recycling  when they stand by a decision like this.

'Hypocritical': Ray Duggleby, 66, accused the council of promoting recycling when it was convenient for them

'I feel very upset and angry at what has happened. I cycled two miles there to  recycle and I had to take it all home.'

A spokesman for East Riding of Yorkshire Council said the Weel site was a very  busy one with a constant flow of traffic.

They said: 'For this reason there would be concern for a cyclist who is moving  around among cars and vans especially when they are reversing.

'Mr Duggleby will have been advised for his own safety not to use a bicycle on  the site.'

George McManus, the Labour Party Parliamentary Spokesman for Beverley, said: 'Ray contacted me and asked if I could help, so I checked it out and it's true.

'The Council say that for health and safety reasons, he's not allowed to drop  his waste at the site by bicycle.

'They say they'd be worried for him because of vehicle movements on site even  although people walk across the site all the time and the maximum speed of cars  is in the region of 5mph.

'Ray is an example to us all. He is s true eco-warrior. By cycling he's keeping  down his carbon footprint. By taking his waste to a proper site he's having it recycled. By refusing to  fly tip, he's helping to keep Beverley tidy.'

Mr McManus added: 'The Council should be encouraging people like Ray, not  putting him off. In order to get to the site he cycles along roads with 40mph speed limits and  yet he's not allowed to go to the re-cycling centre.

'If the site is unsuitable for people like Ray, then the Council should find  somewhere else. Or they could just show some common sense and change the rules.'

Green thinking: Ray Duggleby has even made a specially converted trailer for his bike so he can transport things around without harming the environment
