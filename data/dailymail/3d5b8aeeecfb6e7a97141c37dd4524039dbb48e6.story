Paris Jackson was rushed to hospital in the early hours of Wednesday after an apparent suicide bid.

Her mother Debbie Rowe is understood to have confirmed the reports to Entertainment Tonight and said the 15-year-old is currently at a Los Angeles hospital.

A lawyer for Katherine Jackson, Paris’ grandmother, alluded to how Paris is still coming to terms with the loss of her father Michael Jackson, four years after his death.

'Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are.' Perry Sanders said in a statement to MailOnline.

'It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you. Paris is physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention,' Mr Sanders added, as he made an appeal to the media for privacy.

The teen was listed 
as a potential witness in a massive lawsuit currently being brought by 
the Jackson family against AEG – the concert promoters behind her late 
father Michael’s doomed tour This Is It.

The family, who want
 $40 billion, say superstar Michael died from an overdose of 
prescription drugs after a punishing schedule of rehearsals prior to the
 tour.

The trial which 
began in LA in April is scheduled to last three months. Paris’s older 
brother Prince, 16, is also prepared to take the witness stand. 

Michael Jackson died in June 2009 aged 50 after suffering a
heart attack brought on  from an overdose of propofol and
benzodiazepine.

In recent months, Paris has become increasingly close to her mother, Michael Jackson’s second wife, Debbie Rowe.

Mother and daughter have been pictured spending time together amid 
reports Paris will move in with her mother at her Palmdale ranch in 
California over the summer months.

Rowe,
 54, met Michael when she was a nurse for Dr Arnold Klein, the singer’s 
dermatologist. The pair married when she was six months pregnant with 
Prince in November 1996.

The
 following year she gave birth to Paris. The couple divorced in 1999 and
 Rowe accepted an $8million settlement and gave full custody to the 
popstar.

Music producer Russell Simmons has tweeted his support to the Jackson family, writing: 'My prayers are with Paris Jackson and her family at this time.'

Meanwhile Michael Jackson's former lawyer Tom Mesereau, who represented the singer during his 2005 child molestation trial, said he is 'heartbroken over the news.He told RadarOnline: 'I'm heartbroken over Paris Jackson’s suicide attempt. I’m shocked, and frankly, at a loss for words.'Paris is just a wonderful young lady, beautiful, and extremely bright.'
