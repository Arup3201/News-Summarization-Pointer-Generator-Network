Unemployment has fallen by another 125,000, with a record number of women now in work.

In a fresh boost for the government overall 
levels of youth and long-term unemployment have also both fallen.

The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance also dropped to 1.22 million in January, down by 27,000 - the 15th consecutive monthly fall.

The jobless total was 2.34 million in the final quarter of last year, down by 125,000, giving a rate of 7.2 per cent.

The
 number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance dipped to 1.22 million 
in January, down by 27,000 - the 15th consecutive monthly fall.

More
 women are in work than at any time since records began in 1971, at just
 over 14 million, today's data from the Office for National Statistics 
showed.

But 1.4 million 
people are in part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work, a 
fall of 29,000 over the latest quarter but 46,000 higher than a year 
ago.

Employment Minister Esther 
McVey said: ‘With employment continuing to increase, it's clear that the
 Government's long-term plan to build a stronger, more secure economy is
 helping businesses create jobs and get people into work.

‘Record
 numbers of women are in work and youth unemployment continues to fall, 
which means more people have the security of a regular wage and can plan
 for their future.’

Labour's flagship employment policy would only last for 12 months, the party admitted today.

Every time new unemployment figures are released, Ed Miliband's party repeats its pledge of a 'jobs guarantee'.

It has been described as a 'centrepiece and foundation stone of Labour's economic plan'.

The policy would guarantee a job for under-25s out of work for a year or over-25s claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for two years.

But today Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said it would only last for a single year.

She told the BBC: 'In the first year it would help 55,000 young people and 170,000 people over the age of 25.

'That's a huge number of people, almost a quarter of a million, who would be benefiting from this policy.'

Employment now stands at more than 30 million, a rate of 72.1 per cent, which is 0.6 per cent higher than a year ago.

The
 unemployment rate will remain a key focus, but is no longer linked to 
the Bank of England's pledge to keep interest rates at record lows after
 governor Mark Carney unveiled a new forward guidance policy last week.

The
 Bank had pledged not to consider a rate rise until unemployment fell to
 7 per cent, but with that target set to be reached much earlier than 
expected, the guidance has been replaced.

Average
 earnings increased by 1.1 per cent in the year to December, 0.2 
percentage points up on the previous month, giving average weekly 
earnings of £478.

However, wage rises are still well below the 1.9 per cent rate of inflation revealed in separate figures yesterday.

The
 number of people out of work for longer than a year has fallen by 
45,000 to 845,000, while 451,000 have been unemployed for over two 
years, down by 7,000.

There were 917,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds in the latest quarter, down by 48,000 on the previous three months.

Job vacancies were up by 28,000 to 580,000, the highest since 2008.

However a breakdown of the figures showed that one in 10 new jobs created last year went to people born in Romania and Bulgaria, even before work restrictions were lifted, new figures revealed today.

The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK rose by 40 per cent in 12 months to December 2013. In the run-up to curbs being removed on January 1 there were almost 144,000 people born in the two countries who had a job in the UK, compared to under 102,000 in the last three months of 2012.

Of the 424,503 people who found work in the 12 months to the end of last year, 41,670 were born in Romania and Bulgaria.

The number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria working in the UK rose by 41 per cent year-on-year

The number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria working in Britain has risen dramatically to 144,000

In the three months from October to December there were 30.24million people in work, up 1.4 per cent on the same time a year before.

Among people born in the UK, the number in work rose by 1.1 per cent and by 3 per cent among people from the rest of the European Union.

But most striking was the sharp increase in the number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria finding jobs ahead of the removal of work restrictions.

There were 143,598 people from these countries working in the last quarter of 2013, up 6 per cent on July to September and up 41 per cent year-on-year.

Of the 424,503 people who found work in the 12 months to the end of last year, 41,670 were born in Romania and Bulgaria.

Among Romanian and Bulgarian nationals the figure was slightly lower, taking into account those born in the two countries who have changed nationality. Among this group, 124,716 were in work, up 34 per cent year-on-year.
