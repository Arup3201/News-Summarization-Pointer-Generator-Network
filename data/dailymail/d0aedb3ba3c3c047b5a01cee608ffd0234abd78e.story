Microwaves and ready meals can make us lazy cooks, but this latest gadget takes things a step further.

Called Stirio, the £37 clamp attaches to a pot and stirs your food for you, for up to 90 minutes.

This stops gravy or porridge, for example, becoming lumpy or sticking to the bottom of the pan and leaves the cook to sit back and relax.

Called Stirio, the £37 clamp (pictured) attaches to a pot and stirs food for up to 90 minutes. This stops gravy or porridge, for example, becoming lumpy or sticking to the bottom of the pan

It was designed by a team of inventors at Oslo-based firm Unikia after they became bored of stirring porridge continuously for 45 minutes.

The device is reminiscent of the magical self-stirring cauldron from J.K Rowling’s Harry Potter series.

Stirio has its own motor and is adjustable. It can fit on pots between 6 inches (15cm) and 10 inches (25cm) wide, and between 3 inches (7.5cm) and 7 inches (18cm) tall.

The parts can also be disassembled to make them easier to clean.

Jorgen Solstad, chief executive of Unikia said: ‘Our in-house design team came up with the idea.

For people who want food fast, Lakeland is selling a microwave pressure cooker. 

The £35 kitchen gadget combines the speed of using microwaves and pressure cookers together and is said to be able to cut the time it takes to make a steamed sponge to five minutes. 

Sponges will usually take one and three quarter hours on a traditional hob.  

‘In Norway a family eats porridge for lunch on 24 December, which takes 45 minutes to cook and must be stirred continuously not to burn because it's milk based.

‘We wanted to fix this.’

The wireless gadget is rechargeable and will maintain a steady speed until the power button is pressed or until the battery runs down, which the makers claim is around an hour and a half. 

Stirio also features a plastic stirring blade that can be folded out to reach across the bottom of different sized pots while avoiding scratches on pot coatings.
