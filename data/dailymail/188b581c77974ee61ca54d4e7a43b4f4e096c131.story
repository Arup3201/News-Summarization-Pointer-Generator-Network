Tottenham, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid have all made enquiries about Everton forward Kevin Mirallas.

The Belgian is stalling over discussions on a new contract and that has alerted rival clubs who are keen to see if there is a deal to be done either now or in the summer. Mirallas wants to play Champions League football. He is a firm favourite at Goodsion and manager Roberto Martinez insists he wont countenance any sale.

Tottenham have opened discussions over a move for Yevhen Konoplyanka of Dnipro and have asked to be kept informed about Sassuolo striker Simone Zaza who wants to remain in Italy for the season.

Mirallas scored a free-kick against West Ham in the FA Cup third round replay last week at Upton Park

Tottenham are maintaining contact with Espanyol for Mexico defender Hector Moreno although Arsenal have also made contact after Brian McDermott went to watch the 27-year-old against Valencia last week.

As reported by Sportsmail, Arsenal have interest in Gabriel Paulista of Villarreal and have spoken to his representatives but a work permit would prove difficult.
