Secret Service agents rarely speak, but there’s nothing wrong with their hearing.

Agents confessed to Ronald Kessler, author of an upcoming blockbuster book about the hidden lives of presidents,  that they have overheard Michelle Obama pushing her husband ‘to be more aggressive in attacking Republicans and to side with blacks in racial controversies.’

And Obama did as he was told, says Kessler in The First Family Detail.

When Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida on the night of February 26, 2012.

'That could have been me thirty-five years ago', Obama stated.

Obama was also vocal about a Cambridge, Massachusetts police officer who arrested a black Harvard profession being noisy during a break-in investigation. He viewed it as an unnecessary and stupid arrest.

A former agent listening to the first couple's conversations in the presidential limo, believed Michelle's agenda goes back to a statement she made when Barack was running for president. 'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country'.

Is rude as Hillary is to the Secret Service, the current First Lady, code named Renaissance, is friendly, considerate and treats the agents with respect. She has twenty agents protecting her and she insists that they all call her by her first name.

‘Michelle is friendly – she touches you’, an agent stated and her mother, Marian Robinson, in residence at the White House to help care for their two daughters, goes out of her way to be gracious to the Secret Service as well.

Michelle even gave Father’s Day cards to agents who were dads and working the shift on that day.

The Obamas invited agents to dinner two times at their Hyde Park home in Chicago while he was running for President, and he made sure the agents took time out to eat the chili.

While Bill Clinton was chronically late, Obama usually runs on time but if he’s dragging, Michelle gets on his case and reminds him he is being disrespectful to the agents. 

Gatecrashers: Michaele and Tareq Salahi attended a White House function without invitation in 2009 and were introduced to President Obama in one of the Secret Service's most notorious security breaches

Daughters Malia and Sasha get high marks for being ‘great kids’ and ‘very respectable young ladies’.

While both Barack and Michelle are well liked and respected by the Secret Service, agents disclosed that laxness and undercutting of basic security protocols in this administration now threaten the life of the president as well as the First Lady.

Lax security has allowed guests into events without proper screening to detect firearms. Current agency protocols are not up-to-date and using the latest firearms and they have cut back on the size of counterassault teams.

Agents are also filling out their own test scores on their physical fitness tests as well as not following proper rules for firearm re-qualification.

This imposed cost cutting and lowering of standards first emerged when serial party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi and Carlos Allen were allowed into a White House state dinner in November 2009 while not on the guest list.

Special treatment: According to First Family Detail, Hollywood superstar Bradley Cooper was allowed to drive his car into a function attended by the president and exempted by security checks

The ‘gatecrashers’ were subpoenaed by the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee to appear at a hearing to discuss the breach of security where they invoked the Fifth Amendment.

Allegations: Ronald Kessler has claimed that the Secret Service has a huge underfunding problem in his new book First Family Detail

The lowered agency security standards surfaced again when agents were sent home in April 2012 and exposed as engaging prostitutes while traveling with Obama to Cartagena, Colombia.

Their sordid little affairs blew up when one belligerent agent refused to pay the prostitute her requisite fee.

If agents blow the whistle on any breach of security, they know they will suffer retribution from management so they keep quiet.

‘The pressure not to rock the boat takes precedence over protecting the president from the jackal, the term agents use to refer to a potential assassin’.

Another major breach of security occurred on the night of the White House Correspondent’s Dinner at the Washington Hilton in April 2013.

While the advance security detail swept the hotel and grounds, agents received orders from a high-ranking agency official in New York to allow movie star Bradley Cooper’s vehicle onto the grounds without screening.

Agents were shocked at the breach knowing that it could have been loaded with explosives, biological or chemical weapons.

The canine team was not even allowed to inspect the vehicle.

‘Agents were told not to sweep the car. Just let it in and don’t give Cooper any problems’. Cooper was given a free pass – ‘and this was two weeks after the terrorist attack on our soil in Boston’.

‘That’s just one example of the arrogance of senior managers in the Secret Service. They think they’re accountable to no one’
