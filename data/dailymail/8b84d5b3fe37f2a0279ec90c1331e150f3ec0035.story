ISIS militants have blocked all mobile phone networks in the largest Iraqi city they control, as they fear people may tip off coalition forces about their whereabouts. 

The move represents a change of tactic by the extremist organisation who, up until now, have tried to win support of locals by targeting them through phone services. 

It also comes in the wake of a string of recent victories by Iraqi troops, backed by Shiite and Kurdish militiamen.

ISIS militants took control of Mosul in June during their rapid advance across northern Iraq

Residents in Mosul described a scene of 'chaos' and paralysis' in the city after the militants announced their decision on their Mosul-based radio network. 

Businesses were at a standstill as residents tried to understand what was happening, they said. 

Some are still able to access the Internet, which operates under a different network. 

The militants took control of the city, in northern Iraq, in June during their rapid advance across northern Iraq, after the Iraqi military virtually crumbled when confronted by the group. 

The U.S. began launching airstrikes on August 8 and has conducted at least 22 strikes around the city of Mosul alone.

The city has come to represent the expanding power and influence of the extremist group, which started in Iraq but spread to Syria, where it grew exponentially in the chaos of the country's civil war. 

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's reclusive leader, made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state.

Baghdad-based political analyst Hadi Jalo said that the latest move by the IS group shows the militants are losing confidence after the recent victories by Iraqi troops.

'Even the people in Mosul, who hate the Shiite-led government, are becoming less sympathetic with the militants - whose main victims are Sunnis, not Shiites, nowadays,' said Jalo.

An official in one of the Iraqi mobile phone operators said his company is investigating the issue, but declined to give further details.

Until now ISIS had tried to win local support by targeting people's phones - but have now blocked all phone networks in Mosul, the largest city they have control over

In parts of Syria under its control, the group now administers courts, fixes roads and even polices traffic. 

It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

In Syria, government warplanes kept up air raids on the northern city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State group, killing at least seven people today, activists said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one of the raids struck the house of a judge facing the Islamic State group's tax collection centre. Another air raid targeted an ISIS group checkpoint.

An activist who uses the name Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi said eight airstrikes killed at least seven people, including four women and a child. Al-Raqqawi, who is based outside Syria, heads a collective of activists on the ground in Raqqa.

On Tuesday, similar airstrikes killed at least 95 people in Raqqa, most of them civilians. 

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she is 'horrified' by the reports that Syrian government airstrikes had killed dozens of civilians and demolished residential areas.
