A house husband and his investment banker wife are locked in an £11million divorce battle after a fierce holiday row proved the final straw for their marriage

Weng Choy and his breadwinner wife Lena Tan lived an opulent lifestyle during their 15-year marriage, enjoying homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and the ‘jewel in the crown’ of their marital assets, a £4.5million flat in Kensington, west London.

Mr Choy, 56, filed for divorce in January 2012 after a row on New Year’s Eve while on a family holiday in Singapore.

He is asking the English courts – 
renowned for their generosity in deciding divorce settlements – to hand 
him a slice of the marital assets, which have been valued by lawyers at 
£11million.

Mr Choy, 
who was also a banker, according to his lawyers, before quitting to care
 for the couple’s two sons, claims he sacrificed his own career so that 
his wife’s could flourish.

But
 Miss Tan, 54, a leading hedge fund manager who has worked in the City 
as well as the Far East, is arguing that her husband has no right to 
divorce her in the UK and has initiated her own proceedings in Malaysia.

James
 Turner QC, for Miss Tan, who is asking the Appeal Court to block the 
English divorce bid, said that following a falling out in London in 
September 2010, the couple’s marriage hit a crisis but had survived 
until it ‘struck the rock of the row on New Year’s Eve 2011’.

A
 High Court family judge ruled in March last year that the husband had 
been ‘habitually resident’ in London for at least a year before he filed
 for divorce and so was entitled to end his marriage in the UK.

However,
 Mr Turner argued that, despite more than half of the couple’s wealth 
being invested in Britain, the judge should not have allowed the divorce
 to proceed.

The court heard the couple fought on a family holiday in Singapore (pictured) during Christmas 2011/2012

He insisted 
that the husband’s home had remained in Hong Kong and that the marriage 
had been intact until the fateful holiday row.

‘Married
 family life between the parties continued to some degree at least,’ he 
said, ‘and had Hong Kong as its centre, until a row took place between 
the parties during the Christmas 2011, New Year 2012 period, following 
which the husband came to England.’

Mr
 Turner also said it was unfair that, after agreeing to pay £500,000 to 
her husband from the proceeds of their wine collection, the wife had 
also been ordered by the High Court to pay him a further £100,000 
towards his legal bill.

Tim Bishop QC, for the husband, insisted that his home base had been in London since the 2010 argument.

‘When the centre of the husband’s interest ceased to be Hong Kong, London was the natural and obvious replacement,’ he said.

The
 Malaysian-born couple’s two children had both boarded at English 
schools, he added. ‘The judge found that they had an international 
marriage which involved them moving around the world following the 
wife’s work.

After the marriage broke down . . . the husband’s centre of interests ceased to be dictated by the wife’s working life.’

Mr Choy has obtained a British driving licence as well as a National Insurance number, he added.

Hearing: The Court of Appeal, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice, is set to rule on the pair's divorce

Lord
 Justice Leveson, Lord Justice Aikens and Lady Justice Macur reserved 
their judgment on the case and will give their ruling at a later date.

n
 A businessman asked his partner of 30 years whether she would stay on 
as a housekeeper when he moved his new lover into their home, the High 
Court heard yesterday.

And 
the man – worth more than £13million – could not understand why his 
partner then ‘became aggressive through her lawyers’, a judge said.

The request emerged yesterday as the woman was awarded a payout of more than £6million by Mr Justice Bodey.

He said his judgment could be reported but said the couple, from London, could not be identified.

‘The husband installed the other woman – and her 12-year-old daughter – into the marital home,’ said the judge.

‘The husband told [his partner] he was not intending her to vacate and would she remain as some sort of housekeeper?’

He said she found the suggestion ‘very demeaning and upsetting’.
