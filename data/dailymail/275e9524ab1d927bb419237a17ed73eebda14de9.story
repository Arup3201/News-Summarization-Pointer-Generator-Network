A morning of mists gave way to a warm summery afternoon, as parts of Britain basked in weather that was hotter than Portugal.

People headed for the park and the beach as swathes of the country from Portsmouth and to Manchester were treated to temperatures that rose above 20C - reaching highs of 25C in the South East.

But the low cloud and dew-soaked lawns this morning were a reminder that Sunday's equinox has ushered in the official start of autumn - and wetter, colder weather is on the way as the weekend approaches.

Summer fun: Temperatures reached an unseasonably high 25C in some parts of Britain today as forecasters warned people to make the most of the 'Indian summer'

The average UK-wide temperature for 
September usually peaks at around 16.5C but many places across the 
country have been enjoying mild conditions well above 20C.

Weather forecasters predict the warm 
weather will last until Saturday when wet and windy conditions more 
typical for this time of year move in.

Temperatures
today are expected to hit 25C, and the heat will continue tomorrow with
highs of at least 23C - making the country hotter than a rainy Lisbon 
in Portugal, where the hottest expected is 20C.

Golden days: After a foggy start to the day in Cambridge, the trees in The Backs area emerged in the autumn sunlight in spectacular red, orange and yellow hues

Met Office forecaster Juliet Gardner said: “This is an extension of summer.

'Wednesday to Friday will be warm in brighter spells, while northern parts will be mostly cloudy with some rain.

'The weather is likely to turn increasingly unsettled through the weekend, with showers or longer spells of rain across the UK.

'The rain may be heavy at times, particularly across southern areas.'

British Weather Services senior meteorologist Jim Dale said: 'It’s very warm locally after early fog clears - but will slowly become cooler and more unsettled later in the week.'

Sea mist: Brighton Pier was shrouded in fog, which was expected to lift in time for Ed Miliband's keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference today

Eerie: The burnt-out remains of old Brighton Pier were almost invisible from the shore in the early hours of the morning

Sepia sunrise: Brighton seafront looked as if it had been photographed through a black-and-white lens this morning

Forecast: The South East can expect sunshine today and warm temperatures should continue further into the week, but more of this morning's cloud is likely and the north will see more showery spells

The Met Office said temperatures were
above average because of warm tropical air coming from the South West 
and The Azores, causing an area of high pressure over the country.

But Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson warned that the country will become split by a North/South divide as the week continues.

He said: 'Southern parts will start to see more sunshine while the North will see more cloud moving in.

'There is also a risk of rain in Northern Scotland.

'Temperatures will remain better than average until the end of week.'

Pea souper: The Shard building and the Tate Modern rose out of the cloud as commuters in London made their way to work across the Millennium Bridge this morning

Cloud city: The tops of the tallest buildings were all that was visible of the business and financial buildings at Canary Wharf for several hours this morning

Closing in: Traffic crossing Tower Bridge could barely be seen during this morning's rush hour in London

Lift up: The fog began to recede as the sun rose and London's landmarks began to be visible again to commuters along the river

Invisible: The Shard is completely out of sight in the mist - but a bright red London bus stands out as it crosses a bridge over the Thames

But Mr Wilson advised Britons to make the most of the warm weather as temperatures are due to drop from Saturday onwards.

He
said: 'From Thursday the temperatures will start to drop. There's a lot
of uncertainty at the moment but it looks like it will begin to change 
on Saturday with rain moving in.

'It's likely to remain that way for most of next week so people should make the most of the extended summer sun this week.'

Sunday
marked the autumnal equinox - the official start of autumn, when the 
sun passes directly above the equator and day and night become nearly 
equal in length.

But
while the changing season normally brings lower temperatures and 
blustery weather, autumn appears to be getting off to a slow start this 
year.

One mountain climber was left stunned when he reached the summit of Mount Snowdon and spotted an incredible circular rainbow.

Sam Clack, 33, had spent four hours scaling the highest peak in Wales when he was met by the stunning sight.

He looked over the ridge to see what is known as a Brocken Spectre, a rare phenomenon caused by the sun and his own shadow.

The sun behind him projected his shadow onto the mist below, creating the colourful, halo-like mane.

The phenomenon takes its name from the Brocken, a peak in the Harz Mountains in Germany where it was first identified.

Mr Clack, a radio journalist from Manchester, said a retired physics 
teacher he met at the top of the ridge had explained to him about the Brocken Spectre - 'when he'd lifted his jaw 
from the floor', Mr Clack said.

He added: 'I have never seen one before and may never see another, it was definitely a privilege to have witnessed it.'
