Flag row: The Department for Culture, Media and Sport backtracked after telling a town hall they could not fly the Union Flag at half mast (file picture)

It was to be a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the First World War.

But then a top Whitehall official decided that flying the Union Flag at half-mast on August 4 could confuse the public into thinking someone important had died.

Organisers in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, were upset and disappointed at the insistence by senior policy advisor Fiona Wood that permission had to be given by the Queen or Prime Minister.

She said that flying flags at half-mast was not intended ‘to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events’.

But
 yesterday, after protests, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
backtracked and admitted it had no control over flag flying.

Councillor
 Jeannette Marsh, who arranged the event, said: ‘I did feel quite upset.
 It felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives. 
Many local people felt the same way.’

The
 original refusal came after Shepton Mallet town clerk Daryl Ryall asked
 permission to lower the flag on their town hall as a traditional mark 
of respect.

Ms Wood replied 
in an Email: 'While flags flying in general is deregulated, individuals,
 groups or organisations cannot chose when to fly a flag at half- mast.

'An
 instruction for the half-masting of flags can only be given by Her 
Majesty the Queen (or by or the Prime Minister's Office with approval 
from Buckingham Palace) to mark the death of a member of the Royal 
family or an important statesperson, or to mark a tragedy has just 
happened rather than to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events.

'As
 I am sure you will agree, any independent half-masting of flags may 
confuse other people into thinking that an important figure has just 
died, for example a member of the Royal Family.

'Flags
 are not flown at half-mast for the Remembrance Sunday service for 
example and I hope you can devise another fitting way to pay your local 
tribute as part of the commemorations of the 1st World War.'

Organisers in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, wanted to make a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the First World War

But
 as the ban threatened to spark a row the Government backed down and 
admitted they had no jurisdiction on flag flying - and there are no 
official rules.

A Department
 for Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said: 'Decisions on whether to
 fly flags at half-mast are not made by Government.

'Orders on when to fly flags at half-mast are taken by Buckingham Palace and occur in response to the death of a prominent statesperson or member of the Royal Family.

'Any decision to fly flags at half-mast outside of these occasions would be for local authorities themselves.'

Cadets march past the Cenotaph in Shepton Mallet during an earlier remembrance event

The centenary event will see the Air 
Training Corps cadets stage a vigil, and include a church service and 
music to remember those who gave their lives.

It has been arranged by Councillor Jeannette Marsh who said the original refusal on flying the flag at half-mast had been 'upsetting and disappointing'.

She said: 'I must say I really did feel quite upset.

'It felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives.

'I was very upset to think that we could not mark those ten million lives lost by lowering the flag and I know very many local people felt the same way - very disappointed.'

Resident Will Dunscombe, 54, who staged a 24-hour vigil at the foot of the cenotaph in 2007 to fight plans to move it, slammed the government's intrusion.

He said: 'It should be nothing to do with the Government - why should the Government dictate what we as people want to do?

'They decide enough of what we do and this shouldn't be a political dilemma.

'Let
 people feel that feeling how they want to feel it and stop being so 
critical. They shouldn't interfere and meddle in how people want to 
commemorate - especially young people.'

Councillor Chris Inchley said the government's refusal was 'very sad indeed'.

He
 said: 'People won't be confused - everyone around the country will know
 that that day is to commemorate World War One and the tragic 
consequence that had for many millions of people and families around the
 world and in our community.'

Colleague councillor Neil Shearn added: 'It is totally bureaucratic. It is laughable.

'I
 don't think the government or royalty has anything to do with it at 
all. And I expect if the Queen knew anything about it she would overturn
 it immediately.'
