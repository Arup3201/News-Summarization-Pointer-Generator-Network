Brigham City Police Lieutenant Michael Nelson believes Mr Woodruff shot Alix and the dog before killing himself, though a motive for the apparent murder suicide is not yet clear.

Nelson said there was no suicide note and few clues in the home. He added that Mrs Woodruff wasn't even aware her husband owned a gun.

Relatives told police they didn't know of any domestic problems, though the couple had been fighting.

Neighbors described the family as 'wholesome, nice people.'

'The wife and the husband have had some problems, but to my knowledge, there hasn't been any domestic problems at all or anything like that,' Nelsen told Fox News.

He added to the Deseret News: 'The relationship between the stepfather and the daughter was doing quite well. Everybody was just in total shock.'

Alix's school said the teen attended all her classes on Tuesday.

According to police, the home was undergoing renovations on the ground floor and the family was living in the basement where the bodies were discovered.

Neighbor Rhonda Long said her boyfriend heard popping sounds 'like from a nail gun' and the dog barking earlier in the day but he assumed Mr Woodruff was working on the house.

She said the entire neighborhood was in shock after the slaying.

'I didn't expect anything like that from anybody, especially that family,' she told the Deseret News.

'They just seemed like really wholesome, nice people.'

Both bodies are undergoing autopsies and toxicology screenings to determine cause of death.

Nelsen said the investigation was continuing.

'They're going through with a fine-toothed comb to make sure we don't leave anything uncovered, hopefully find some answers, but some of it may be left with them, too. It's hard to say whether we'll get the whole story.'
