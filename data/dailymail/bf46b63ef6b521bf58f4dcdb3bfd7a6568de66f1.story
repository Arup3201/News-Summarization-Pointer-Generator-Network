The wealth of the average American household declined between 1983 and 2013, according to a leading economist.

Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, said in a new study that in those 30 years the country's net worth rose, but the average household saw a dip in wealth.

Writing in a paper entitled Household Wealth Trends in the United States, 1962-2013: What Happened over the Great Recession?, Professor Wolff claimed that America's worth rose partly because technology has improved and productivity has increases.

This means that society as a whole has become better and generating wealth.

The issue, for many, is that this extra wealth has been funnelled into the top 20 per cent of the population, with the top one per cent finding themselves 82 per cent better off.

However, the bottom 60 per cent has become poorer, Vox.com reported.

Wolff found that the median wealth figure for middle-income families - that means it's been adjusted for inflation - for 1983 was $78,000 and the median wealth figure for 2013 was $63,800.

However, these are 2013 prices - households in 1983 would, in fact, have had lower wealth in cash terms, but it would have enabled them to buy more than in 2013. 

It follows the announcement in December by the Federal Reserve that Americans' net worth slipped in the July-September quarter, as shrinking stock portfolios overwhelmed a solid gain in home values.

U.S. household wealth declined 0.2 percent in the third quarter to $81.3 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. Americans' stock and mutual fund portfolios shrank $700 billion. The value of their homes increased $245 billion.

The slight drop comes after Americans' wealth rose to a record in the April-June quarter.

A booming stock market and a rebound in home values have enabled the nation's net worth to rebound from the Great Recession and reach new highs.

Yet other data shows that those gains have mostly benefited wealthier households, while leaving middle-class wealth largely unchanged. Wolff calculates that the median household's net worth was just $63,800 in 2013, down from $64,600 in 2010. That decline came after a huge drop from 2007 to 2010, when median net worth plummeted 44 percent from $115,100.

The small decrease from 2010 to 2013 occurred despite big run-ups in stock and home prices over that period. So why haven't middle-class households benefited more?

Wolff cites two factors. First, middle-income households rely much more than wealthier households on the value of their homes. Houses accounts for nearly 63 percent of middle-class assets, Wolff said in his paper. That compares to just nine per cent for the wealthiest one per cent.

Meanwhile, most stock market wealth is held by the top 10 per cent of households, which owns 80 per cent of stocks. Only 9.5 percent of middle-class assets are in stocks.

The second reason, Wolff says, is that stagnating incomes likely forced many middle-income earners to sell assets and use the cash to cut their debt levels and maintain consumption. Median household income slipped from $49,000 in 2010 to $46,700 three years later, according to Fed data.

This trend can be seen in other data. Middle-class households are now less likely to own homes, as their home ownership rate fell from 68 percent in 2010 to 66.7 percent three years later.

Retirement savings have suffered even more. The percentage who owned defined-contribution retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, fell from 53 percent in 2007 before the recession, to 44 percent in 2013. The dollar value of middle-class accounts dropped 16 percent during that period.

'They were still depleting their assets because income remained very sluggish,' Wolff said.
