A trapper has captured a huge 11-foot-long alligator suspected of killing a 55lb pit bull puppy in a Florida lake.

Eric Glover was playing with his 10-month-old pit bull King at Eagle Nest Park in Orlando when the alligator snatched the dog in its jaws and dragged him underwater.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the alligator was trapped by Florida Nuisance Alligator trapper Jason Daikus around 11pm Wednesday after three days in pursuit.

Fast: Dog owner Eric Glover said he was 'shocked' and didn't have time to react when the alligator snatched his 10-month-old pit-bull, King

Glover said he wanted to animal trapped so that it couldn't hurt any other dogs or people after his ordeal.

'My boy, he turned around, came to me, and he took off to run back again,' Glover told WKMG after the incident.

'And when he took off again, the gator came out, snatched him in front of the bank here and took him in. And that was it.'

Glover correctly told authorities he believed the alligator was about 11-feet. It came in at 11-feet and one-inch.

The attack was so quick, Glover didn't have time to do anything about it.

The 55-pound pit-bull didn't even make a sound, the man said.

'I don't even think he knew he was hit,' Glover told WFTV about his pup. 'It was like that quick.'

Trappers with Florida Fish and Wildlife on Monday scoured the lake for hours in search of the alligator.

They left empty-handed after sunset.

'I couldn't do nothing,' Glover told WFTV. 'I froze, and I am like, "Oh, my God. That is a gator." Like, my instincts, "That is a gator eating my dog." I was shocked.' 

WKMG reported that several homes back onto the lake, and a bike path and jogging trail rings the lake's edge and many children walk along it to school every day.

At least one neighbor said he'd seen a big alligator lurking about recently.

'I hear people say it's more than one,' Chris Bradley told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They took an alligator out of a smaller pond nearby.'

According to WFTV, the alligator is too big to be released back into the wild and will be harvested. 

Some 12 people were bitten by alligators in Florida, according to the Sentinel. None of the attacks was fatal, although at least seven bites resulted in major injuries.
