The blast, which occurred at a building site, killed a nearby construction worker and injured four of his colleagues.

Flames shot more than 100 metres into the air and also damaged nearby parked cars, The Local reported.

It is believed to have been caused by a gas leak which subsequently caught fire.

Gas transport company Gascade said it wasn't clear why the pipe, part of a 57 kilometre pipeline that leads southward to the city of Karlsruhe was damaged during work that it commissioned.

Police said the main fire at the site was extinguished by late afternoon and smaller fires were now under control.
