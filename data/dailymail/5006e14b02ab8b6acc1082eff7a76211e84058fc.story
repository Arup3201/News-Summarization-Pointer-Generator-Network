Scottish Second World War heroes who saw off Nazi attacks while sailing across the Arctic Ocean raised a glass of vodka to celebrate after they were honoured by the Russian government.  

During the war the brave men were on convoys which sailed four million tonnes of vital supplies to soldiers battling against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front.

Around 3,000 civilian sailors lost their lives on the missions, which Winston Churchill called 'the worst journey in the world', between 1941 and 1945.

But today 48 Scottish veterans were finally honoured by the Russian government for the sacrifices they made to help the then Soviet Union.

Never forgotten: Around 3,000 civilian sailors were killed on the convoy's dangerous journeys from Scotland to the battlefield, with Nazi ambushes and freezing conditions to contend with

The Foreign Office had previously blocked the Russian government's plans to honour Britain's Arctic heroes because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals.

But after nearly 70 years, dressed in smart blazers and decorated with awards, dozens of surviving sailors took their place in the front row for a special ceremony at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh today.

A total of 48 Scots were presented with the Ushakov Medal - for exceptional bravery and courage at sea - in front of their friends and family by Russian officials. 

Harold O'Neill, 92, from Haddington, East Lothian, was in London when the war started and joined the Royal Navy as a Seaman at the age of 20.

He said he had always wanted to volunteer and go to sea, adding that he was surprised how tough the experience would turn out to be.

He said: 'I was part of the Royal Navy, we were called Churchill's pirates. When you had a meal on the boat there was more on your lap than down your throat, the sea was that bad.

The convoys, with crews from Britain and other Allied navies, sailed four million tonnes of vital supplies to soldiers battling against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front

Mr O'Neill (pictured) said Britain would have lost the war was it not for the convoy's vital deliveries to soldiers fighting against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front

The Arctic convoys also carried coal, ore and timber back to Britain after delivering weapons and ammunition to the frontline

'Life at sea was pretty rough. I can say it was an experience. It was really tough.

'I feel very honoured and very thankful because Russia has always thought about us. I have three Russian medals.

'I am very proud about what I have accomplished. Not just me but other people involved.

'If we hadn't supplied the Russians with four million tonnes of equipment then we would have lost the war and I wouldn't be sitting here.

'The Germans had a far better army than ours. When Germany attacked Russia they had an army of over three million.

'If we hadn't supplied them in order for them to fight back we would have been bloody well stuck.' 

Many of the ageing veterans were unable to attend the ceremony themselves, but 12 of them were represented by family members.

The Arctic convoys did not just carry arms and supplies to Soviet ports - they also carried back vital raw materials such as coal, ore and timber to beleaguered Britain.

Respect: Russia is giving medals to more than 200 Scottish veterans over the coming months

The Ushakov Medal was named in honour of Russian admiral Fyodor Ushakov who never lost a battle and was proclaimed patron saint of the Russian Navy

Timofey Kunitskiy, the Russian vice-consul general in Edinburgh, said there had been a strong desire to recognise the sacrifice made by Arctic convoy sailors.

He said: 'Russia has been committed to pay respects to the British veterans of the Arctic convoys just as they pay respects to their own veterans.

'Some of these veterans already have Russian medals awarded to them before but some years ago the Russian government decided to award a completely different type of award to these sailors - an award that is given specifically for bravery in the sea.

'We are going to give the medals to more than 200 veterans across Scotland. We were planning the ceremonies for November and December but we were approached by many veterans bringing our attention to the fact that Remembrance Sunday is coming.

'Within one week we managed to organise this great ceremony thanks to the hospitality of St Mary's Cathedral.

'Arctic convoys were one of the real demonstrations of the war time alliance Britain and Russia had 70 years ago.

'These particular medals are one of the highest Russian military decorations.'

The Ushakov Medal was named in honour of Russian admiral Fyodor Ushakov who never lost a battle and was proclaimed patron saint of the Russian Navy.

Russia has already awarded the medal to veterans from Australia, Canada and the US for their parts played in helping to fight off the advance of Hitler's forces between 1941 and 1945.

Ceremonies will also take place later this week in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness, with 214 veterans being recognised across Scotland.
