Ed Miliband had dinner with Hollywood star George Clooney and his glamorous British wife Amal, it has been revealed.

The Labour leader was invited to the exclusive gathering at the London home of top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Mrs Clooney is a barrister at Mr Robertson’s London chambers, Doughty Street.

Mr Miliband was invited to the soiree to be briefed on proposals to introduce fresh sanctions against Russia.

The Labour leader is now considering plans to ban a string of Russian officials from entering the UK, the Telegraph has reported.

Mrs Clooney wants the UK government to introduce US-style travel restrictions on Russian citizens allegedly behind the murder of whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky.

Mr Magnitsky died after months of prison beatings after revealing government corruption.

Under measures adopted by the United States, 34 police chiefs, judges and tax officials involved in the Magnitsky case are banned from entering the country. Campaigners now want to see similar measures imposed in Britain.

The high-powered dinner took place at Mr Robertson’s London mansion.

Anti-Putin campaigner Bill Browder, whose firm Hermitage Capital Management was the victim of the £150 million fraud after being raided by Russian police, briefed Mr Miliband on his case.

Mr Clooney is understood to have read Mr Browder’s forthcoming book on the case, Red Notice: How I became Putin No 1 Enemy and told the gathering that it could be made into a film.

One source told the Telegraph that Mr Miliband appeared “very keen” on the proposals afterwards.

The revelation comes after Mrs Clooney used her first Golden Globes red carpet appearance yesterday to make a political statement - pinning a 'je suis Charlie' button on her Dior handbag in support of France following a series of terrorist attacks last week.

She was joined by her husband and several other stars who flashed the viral phrase for cameras.

'I am Charlie' is a statement of solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine where eight journalists were murdered - along with two policemen and two bystanders - by Islamist fanatics last weekend.

Dame Helen Mirren, Kathy Bates and Diane Kruger also voiced their support.

Film producer Harvey Weinstein wrote in a Variety column that he hopes stars use the Golden Globes as a chance to pledge solidarity with French journalists who were killed last week.

'There's always champagne on the table. I hope we can all raise glasses and that someone like Tina, Amy or George Clooney will urge us to toast with 300 million viewers around the world: 'Je suis Charlie, je suis juif, je suis Ahmed,' he wrote.

Mrs Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, told Elle that she was wearing a Dior gown and carrying a handbag that was 'customized in solidarity with the French people who've gone through a terrible week.'
