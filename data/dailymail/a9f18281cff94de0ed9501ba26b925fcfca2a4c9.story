Normally the rejects of the Christmas dinner plate, sprouts are often shoved aside to make way for roast potatoes and scoops of stuffing.

But a self-styled Willy Wonka may have achieved the impossible task of getting children to eat their greens over Christmas – by covering them in chocolate.

Chocolate shop owner and professional magician, Andrew Simpson, now has queues of curious customers lining up outside his shop to sample the new delicacy Truffle Sprouts he has created using a top secret recipe.

Chocolatier Andrew Simpson says making the truffles is a long and drawn out process and it takes hours to make just one batch

The 51-year-old, who runs Simpson’s Chocolates at Elsecar Heritage Centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, came up with the idea following the success of his chocolate sprouts, which he introduced two years ago.

The chocolatier, who gives talks in schools and turns classrooms into chocolate factories, said he started experimenting with the festive vegetables six years ago at a family party.

He said: 'It all started five or six years ago when we had a chocolate fountain and I was looking for something to cover in chocolate.

'I went to the salad graveyard that everyone has in their fridge and found the sprouts. I used a raw sprout and tried it and to my amazement it tasted really good.

The eccentric chocolatier added that he is constantly having to tweak his secret recipe as each batch of sprouts can taste different

'Everyone started trying them and wanted more, same so I took it one step further and introduced them to the public. Parents are stunned to see their child eating a raw sprout.'

Since then Andrew has been working 
hard on a truffle recipe he can use with the sprouts, which only have a 
two day shelf life once ready.

He says making the truffles is a long and drawn out process and it takes hours to make just one batch.

The
eccentric chocolatier added that he is constantly having to tweak his 
secret recipe as each batch of sprouts can taste different depending on 
where they have come from and if they have been through a good frost or 
not.

He said: 'People keep 
asking for my chocolate sprouts year after year and I wanted to give 
them something extra special this year.

Tuck in: The texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout, Andrew claims

'The Truffle Sprouts are a bit like an after dinner mint or good to be eaten in between courses or even just straight out of the fridge as one of your five-a-day.

'The texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout but you have to try it to believe it.'

Andrew said despite the large amount of sprouts he eats while making the truffles he will never get sick of them.

He said: 'I love sprouts and I hope by trying my Truffle Sprouts this Christmas more people will learn to love them.

'Unfortunately, although I have made them taste a lot better, I haven’t come up with a recipe which stops them giving you wind.'

Andrew, who is working on his latest creation – Marmite Truffles added: 'People say I am like a real life Willy Wonka coming up with weird and wacky ideas like this but I just like adding a bit of magic back into confectionary.'
