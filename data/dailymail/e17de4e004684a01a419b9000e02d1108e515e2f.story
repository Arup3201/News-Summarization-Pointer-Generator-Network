Fernando Torres will be Spain's No 9 at the World Cup after Vicente del Bosque revealed his squad numbers for the tournament in Brazil.

The Chelsea striker was awarded the iconic number, while Manchester United's Juan Mata got No 13, Manchester City's David Silva No 21 and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla No 20.

But Diego Costa will want to forget Spain's latest training session in a hurry after the striker was nutmegged twice, first by his potential Chelsea team-mate Cesar Azpilicueta then by Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba.

Frustrated: Costa reacts after Azpilicueta nutmegged him as the Spain team looked relaxed in training

The Spain team looked in high spirits at training, trying to nutmeg one another during passing exercises, but Costa had the last laugh when he unleashed a tremendous shot.

The striker is at the centre of a Â£35million rumour that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is set to pounce on the Atletico Madrid player.

The Special One's move for the La Liga winner was only delayed by a hamstring injury, causing his medical at Stamford Bridge to be put back.

Costa has just one cap for Spain, after switching his allegiance from Brazil.

The forward is sure to receive a hostile reception when he plays in the country he snubbed.
