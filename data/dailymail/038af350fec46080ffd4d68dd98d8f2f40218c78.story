A transvestite without a medical license has been accused of practicing plastic surgery out of a motel room, where he injected silicone into patients' buttocks and closed the wounds with Krazy Glue.

Calvin E. Butler, also known as Tamieka Butler, allegedly worked from a room at the El Patio Motel in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he charged patients as much as $400 a visit.

At least two of his 'clients' - a man and a woman - have since been hospitalized with severe infections, and one even needed sections of his buttocks removed following the treatment.

One of the alleged victims told sheriff's deputies in December that she visited Butler at the motel four times between September and October and paid $200 each time, NBC Miami reported.

After she took off her clothes, Butler used a felt-tip pen to mark crosses on areas of her buttocks that he believed 'needed fullness', she told authorities.

He then injected a clear substance - 
which he told her was 'sterile silicone' - into her buttocks using a 
syringe and after wiping away any fluid, applied Krazy Glue to the 
incisions, she said.

Butler allegedly once told her he 
bought the silicone from a nurse at Florida Medical Center and, on 
another occasion, said he bought it from a woman named 'Debra' who 
carried out the same work.

After the final visit, the woman 
began feeling pain at the injection sites, and Butler told her to take 
warm baths and massage the areas.

Yet the woman began to experience 
fevers and swollen lymph nodes and in mid-November, she began suffering 
from open and oozing wounds on her buttocks.

She went to hospital and received 
antibiotics, but the pain soon returned. She returned to hospital, where
she was treated for Lymphadenitis, a swelling of the lymph nodes due to
a bacterial infection.

Five weeks later she had still not recovered and was suffering from chronic pain and a chronic cough, and is now disfigured, the affidavit noted.

Another victim told police that he 
too was admitted to hospital after allegedly receiving the injections 
from Butler, and even needed areas of his buttocks removed.

From his bed at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, the man told deputies he met Butler several years ago and began getting the injections on a weekly basis from June until October last year.

Butler charged him $100 as they were friends, but he told the man he would charge strippers $400.

In October, the man began developing sores where the injections had been administered and Butler told him to 'toughen up' and gave him oral antibiotics, according to the affidavit.

But in November he was admitted to hospital with an infection, and doctors tested the wounds and found they contained MRSA and other infections and that he needed areas removed.

Butler was allegedly angry that the man sought medical attention and visited him in hospital wearing a large wig, jewellery and a fur coat.

Scene: Butler allegedly rented a room at El Patio Motel in Key West to carry out the illegal procedures

When the man asked what he was doing there, Butler answered: 'You need to remember who the b**** in charge is', according to the affidavit.

Butler has a criminal history dating back to 2001, including solicitation of prostitution, solicitation to commit prostitution, driving with a suspended license and resisting an officer.

He is being held on $15,000 bond.

The incident is the latest in a string involving illegal buttock injections in South Florida

Last month, a couple in Hialeah was arrested for allegedly performing a bitched procedure, and in 2011, Oneal Ron Morris from Miami Gardens was arrested for allegedly injecting patients with cement, Fix-a-Flat and other substances in their buttocks.
