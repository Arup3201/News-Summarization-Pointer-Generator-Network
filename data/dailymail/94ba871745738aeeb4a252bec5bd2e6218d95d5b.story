Thierry Henry says that Costa Rica showed England how to combat Andrea Pirlo and proved that team ethic triumphs over individual quality.

The unfancied Central Americans booked their place in the last 16 and condemned Roy Hodgson’s side to an early exit following their 1-0 victory over Italy.

England had been beaten 2-1 by the Italians in their Group C opener having allowed midfield playmaker Pirlo to dictate the contest.

But Costa Rica subdued the Juventus man as Bryan Ruiz’s first-half header gave them an unlikely but deserved win.

Henry also believes Costa Rica were good value for their success and drew comparisons with England’s failure to deal with Pirlo.

‘Costa Rica went forward and were pressing Pirlo. He never had one chance to turn and pick a pass. If you let Pirlo play he will expose you,’ said the BBC pundit.

‘They did not show Pirlo any respect during the game.’

Verdict: Thierry Henry was full of praise for Costa Rica and critical of England

The former France international added: ‘I’m sure you didn’t know one player from Costa Rica. But if you have a good team, sometimes you don’t need names.

‘Costa Rica showed us that without the quality that England, Italy and Uruguay have, if you are well organised and have an idea of what you need to do then you can win.’

Fellow pundit Clarence Seedorf echoed Henry’s sentiment.

‘I think Costa Rica are better tactically (than England) because the (Italy) midfield was completely blocked,’ said the former Holland midfielder.

‘I agree with Thierry, it’s about having a team.’

Rio Ferdinand, meanwhile, says that England did not deserve to remain in the competition on the evidence of their defeats to Italy and Uruguay.

‘You have to earn the right to stay in a tournament and England have not done that,’ he said.

‘They have been a bit naïve in situations. When they got back into it against Uruguay at 1-1 we had a chance to get a point and say “right, we’re ready for the last game” and they didn’t.’

And ITV pundit Patrick Vieira said: ‘You can't say that England have played badly over the 2 games. But you need to score when you have momentum.’
