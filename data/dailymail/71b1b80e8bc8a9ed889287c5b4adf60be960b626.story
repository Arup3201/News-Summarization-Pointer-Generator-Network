A couple who set up a CCTV camera to catch vandals were left aflutter when it captured this eerie footage - of what they believe is a 'child ghost' leaping over their car.

Lisa Rigley, 44, and husband Phil, 51, set up the camera outside their home after a spate of attacks on their cars.

But they were stunned when they spooled through the footage and saw a strange shape fly into their driveway and clamber over their Volvo Estate.

Bugged by a ghost: Lisa and Phil Rigley were left in a flutter when they spooled through the footage and saw a strange shape leaping over their Volvo Estate

It appears to show a white glowing orb jumping over their car in their driveway.

The ghostly pest then vanishes out of shot before reappearing on the opposite side of the road.

Mother-of-two Lisa, who works as a doctor’s receptionist, said: 'The image of a child jumped over my fence, landed over the roof of my car, flew down the street and flew back.

'I’m absolutely gobsmacked by this. I’ve got the footage here, it’s the image of a young child about four or five.

What a pest: The eerie clip was captured art 1.30am on August 1 outside the couple's home in Clifton, Nottingham

'It’s a ghost, it’s got to be.

'We set the cameras up years ago after our cars were vandalised but we’ve never seen anything like this before.

'Our neighbour came over to ask if we could go through the tape after she had some ornaments stolen from her front garden.

Scary: Lisa Rigley said the white apparition looked like Casper the friendly ghost as it appeared outside her home, right

'We went through the tape to see if we could see anyone walking past our gate at the time of the theft and saw this weird hoodie-ghost jumping on our car.

'It really was spooky. It was one of those weird feelings where you just think to yourself, ‘what on earth is it?’

'It looks like Casper the friendly ghost but it was certainly leaping all over the bonnet of our Volvo Estate.'

Husband Phil, a delivery driver, captured the footage on one of the couple’s four black-and-white cameras.

He said: 'I am cynical about ghosts because I don’t believe in them but this footage is strange.

'There is probably a perfectly rational explanation but I have checked the tape and there is no distortion or damage which could have caused this.

'I also checked the car and there were no signs of damage so at least we don’t have to pursue the ghost for criminal damage.'
