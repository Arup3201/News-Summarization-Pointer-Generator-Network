Antibacterial soap is pointless because most people do not use it correctly, a researcher has claimed.

The increasingly popular product has little or no benefit for most people because they do not wash their hands for long enough.

Dr Rolf Halden, from the Center for Environmental Security, at Arizona State University, says the soaps are beneficial in hospitals where people know how to use them, but that they are pointless in the home.

Dr Rolf Halden says it is pointless for most people to use antibacterial soaps as they do not wash their hands for long enough to allow them to work effectively

He said that to kill bacteria people need to wash their hands with antibacterial soap for 20 to 30 seconds, but that most people only do so for an average of six seconds.

As a result, he says antibacterial soaps will be no more effective than other soaps, Live Science reports.

Dr Halden adds that miicrobes can also adapt to antibacterial ingredients in the soaps, meaning they become resistant to them.

He believes this could even increase their resistance to antibiotics which could make it more difficult for doctors to treat infections.

Dr Halden has also warned that there is some evidence to suggest the chemicals in antibacterial soaps can affect our hormone levels.

During the last 20 years, the number of products containing triclosan and triclocarban – antimicrobial chemicals – has soared. 

Dr Halden says the soaps are effective in hospitals where staff know they have to wash their hands for between 20 and 30 seconds to kill bacteria effectively

As a result, some three-quarters of people in the U.S. now have the substances in their urine.

The Food and Drug Administration has now started the process of regulating the use of antibacterial products.

It says they will have to be taken out of all products unless the manufacturers can prove they are both effective and safe for human use.

‘The FDA's move is a prudent and important step toward preserving the efficacy of clinically important antibiotics, preventing unnecessary exposure of the general population to endocrine disrupting and potentially harmful chemicals, and throttling back the increasing release and accumulation of antimicrobials in the environment,’ Dr Halden told Live Science.
