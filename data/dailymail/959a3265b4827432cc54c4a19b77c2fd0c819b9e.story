A dim-witted drug dealer has been jailed for more than three years after he asked a friend to take a picture of him in the act.

Police found the incriminating photo on 22-year-old Peter Shaw’s phone after arresting him on suspicion of drugs offences at his home in Radford, Nottingham.

The image, which showed him wearing a mask and gloves and measuring out drugs in neat rows on a kitchen worktop, was just one of a string of boastful photos - including some posted on Facebook.

Not too bright: Peter Shaw was convicted after police seized this photo of him with drugs - from his own phone

Caught in the act: The images on one of three mobile phones showed Shaw with gloves, a mask and a scalpel

'Tis the season: This image - which appears to show a tiny Christmas tree made out of cannabis - was posted to Shaw's Facebook page, where he described himself as having studied narcotics at Harvard University

Show-off: Another image posted on Facebook showed wads of banknotes perched on top of a man's crotch

Images seized by police from three mobile phones showed large quantities of cash and illegal substances - as well as Shaw handling and preparing drugs.

And the drug dealer was not shy about showing off on Facebook, where one of his main profile images was a wad of banknotes perched on top of a man's crotch complete with a Louis Vuitton belt.

The photo posted in January this year - six months after his arrest - was accompanied by one of a tiny Christmas tree which appeared to be made out of cannabis and was uploaded on December 24.

Shaw's profile boasted of studying 'narcotics at Harvard University' and said he worked at a 'hyperbolic time chamber'.

In June last year, weeks before he was arrested, a photo was uploaded of a hand holding what appeared to be cannabis in the street. The images had still not been removed today.

Another image showed him handing small packages of drugs, with a distinctive tattoo on his hand clear to see

Measured: Police had almost everything they needed to conduct an investigation - including the drugs' weight

Nottingham Crown Court heard Shaw was arrested in July last year after officers stopped and searched him outside his home in Radford, Nottingham.

A search of the house revealed equipment used to prepare drugs including scales, bags, rubber gloves and Rizla papers.

They also discovered 33.4 grams of crack cocaine which he had hidden in a wheelie bin outside the house.

But the clearest evidence was on Shaw's phones - where images showed him in a kitchen preparing drugs, surrounded by scales, bags, a kitchen knife, a scalpel and a bottle of Lucozade.

Another photo showed him measuring out what appeared to be 12.3 grams of crack cocaine rocks on a set of scales, while one more showed a cardboard box full of cash.

Faced with the evidence, the 22-year-old pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and was jailed for three years and five months.

Evidence: Shaw's profile picture on Facebook. He has now been jailed for 41 months for intent to supply

Own goal: In June last year, weeks before he was arrested, a photo was uploaded to Shaw's Facebook of a hand holding what appeared to be cannabis in the street. The images had still not been removed today

Detective Constable Steve Fenyn of Nottinghamshire Police said: 'The case against Shaw was helped by his own ego which saw a friend photographing him committing the crime.

'He was literally caught in the act on camera.'

He added: 'Drugs cause misery to communities, fuelling other crimes such as burglary and violence to feed a habit.

'People like Shaw don’t think about the consequences for others, they just see it as an easy way to make money.

'We are pleased to see that this time Shaw’s selfish actions have caught up with him and landed him with a jail term.'
