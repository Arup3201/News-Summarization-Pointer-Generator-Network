Claims: The book reports alleged conversations with Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal and Truman Capote, including Vidal and Capote's 'revelations' about Jackie Kennedy's love life

Driven to distraction by the amorous betrayals of her
husband, Jackie Kennedy embarked on a wild fling with ballet dancer Rudolf
Nureyev while she was still in the White House, according to a new tell-all
book.

Nureyev, who was nine years younger than the First Lady,
was also once spotted with Jackie’s brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy ‘kissing
each other passionately in a phone box’, the book claims.

Much has been written through the years about President
Kennedy’s dalliances while in office. His mistresses were famously said to
include actresses Marilyn Monroe and Angie Dickinson, mafia moll Judith Exner
and a 19-year-old White House intern.

But ‘The Pink Triangle’ – due for release on the 20th
anniversary of Jackie Kennedy’s death from cancer in 1994 – suggests the First
Lady wasn’t content to sit idly by while her husband had countless affairs.

According to Globe magazine, which has an
advance copy of the book, it claims Jackie flew Nureyev to Washington in 1963 and they
soon ‘plunged into a secret love affair that lasted years.’

‘Jackie first fell for Rudi the day she invited him and
his legendary dance partner Margot Fonteyn to perform at the White House during
Jack’s administration,’ writes co-author Darwin Porter.

The First Lady arranged a private jet for Nureyev and the
dancer reportedly sat in JFK’s rocking chair and informed the president’s wife:
‘Unlike your husband, I have a powerful back.’

Later days: Jackie Kennedy allegedly had an affair with Rudolf Nureyev in the 1960s, but they remained close for decades as they are pictured here in 1983 when she was married to Aristotle Onassis

While only a few close friends in America allegedly knew about the
fling, the couple remained close after JFK’s 1963 assassination.

They were photographed together in the English
countryside in November 1968 and that same year, Paris Match magazine claimed
the ballet star had been overheard drunkenly boasting about his conquest.

Nureyev, who defected to the west from the Soviet Union
in 1961, made no secret of the fact that the Kennedys fell under his spell. 

‘I am the sexiest man alive,’ he told a Danish newspaper
before his death from AIDS in 1993. ‘Just ask Lee Radziwill. Just ask Jackie
Kennedy. And if you don’t believe me, ask Bobby and John-John Kennedy. Nobody
can resist me. Everyone who has gone to bed with me has fallen in love with
me,’ he added.

The book details the lives of playwright Tennessee
Williams and two of Jackie’s closest friends, authors Truman Capote and Gore
Vidal.

Capote told Porter at a 1977 dinner in Key West, Florida,
that Jackie and her sister Lee Radziwill both competed for Nureyev’s
affections.

‘I think Rudi systematically plans to seduce every member
of my family, even my son when he grows up,’ the book says Jackie confessed to
Capote. 

Capote was also said to be shocked to learn about
Nureyev’s affair with Bobby Kennedy, whom the writer had long suspected of
being a deeply closeted homosexual,’ says Globe.

An outraged Jackie only ended the relationship when she
saw the dancer paying too much attention to her son, JFK Jr., writes Porter.

He
says she clashed with Nureyev in 1993 when she learned he was encouraging her
son to become an actor rather than go into politics as his family wanted.

A second ballet dancer, American John Kriza, was also
linked to Jackie, according to the book.

All in the family: A new book claims that not only did Jackie and Bobby have romantic affairs with Nureyev, but so did her sister Lee Radziwell (seen with Nureyev in 1987)

‘Each of us launched an affair with him,’ writer Gore
Vidal is quoted as saying. ‘Jackie using my apartment when I did not have John
otherwise engaged.’

Although Jackie played the part of the picture-perfect
wife during the marriage, she did spend some time apart from her husband.

At a low point in their marriage, she escaped from the
pressure cooker life in D.C. on an Italian cruise in 1962 with Fiat’s
millionaire kingpin Gianni Agnelli and then sailed the Aegean Sea with
Aristotle Onassis on his yacht, the Christina, the following year.

Camelot's controversy: For decades, it was only former President John F. Kennedy's love affairs that were public

There were rumors of a close relationship with actor
William Holden, although it was never more than speculation.

The new book claims Richard Nixon also tried to seduce
Jackie before the 1960 presidential election.

‘One afternoon, when Jack was making one of his endless
speeches, Nixon made a pass at me,’ Jackie revealed to Tennessee Williams,
writes Porter, who co-authored the book with Danforth Prince.
