Before we get into Santi Cazorla’s rating for his masterful display against two of the most mediocre midfield performers in Manchester City’s recent history, first some insight.

This is my long-held view, but the match ratings are a complete waste of time.

They are not based on a calculations from Opta, heat maps, passing percentages and touches of the ball to give a considered statistical view after careful analysis.

Arsenal's Spanish playmaker Santi Cazorla produced a masterful performance in his side's 2-0 win at Manchester City on Sunday... but it was only worthy of a rating of 7/10 online and 7.5 in Monday's Daily Mail

They are done by one person who is responsible for umpteen other duties, often at the same time, under the pressure of deadlines of website and newspaper.

It means studying 22 players plus substitutes, along with the referee, both managers and sending it on the final whistle. Within minutes it is online.

Cazorla was the go-to man on Sunday, an easy pick because he scored a penalty and sent in the free-kick for Olivier Giroud to score Arsenal’s second.

The Independent, The Sun and The Express gave him 8/10, he was 9/10 in the Mirror and good luck to them.

He was man of the match - and there was a case for it - in the Daily Star and the Guardian, but not for me.

Life would be easier if I followed the golden rule - give the highest mark to the player who scored the winner, or set it up - and you won’t get clubbed to death on Twitter.

How Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rated Arsenal's midfield and forward line in Monday's Daily Mail

This is the life of a football reporter, looking up from a laptop screen and hoping to see a killer pass or a key decision in real time.

If you don’t, you ask a colleague sitting next to you for his opinion or pray to God that a crackly TV in the press box is a) working and b) about to show a replay.

There is no time, so there is a reliance to use obvious match-winning contributions, such as a penalty struck with conviction in the 23rd minute or a free-kick in the 67th, to stand out.

There is no hard and fast rule about marking players out of 10 because people will aggregate them based on various values, all of them refined over a period of years based on past experiences.

Perhaps it is little wonder Cazorla stood out for so many people because it is so rare for him to have this kind of influence on a game.

Cazorla is a good player, but not a great and let’s not pretend otherwise.

Yes perhaps he probably did deserve more than a 7 (online) and 7.5 in a considered appraisal in the paper, but good God you would think there was a fire judging by the social media feeds, along with the customary email from the Head of Sport Lee Clayton.

There is no need for an alarm in my house any more because he takes care of it before 6am after a game with his complaints, because I didn’t read the game the same way as he did.

I got one after West Ham v Everton and another this morning.

This game could easily have seen Francis Coquelin, stationed in front of Arsenal’s back four, or Laurent Koscielny given man of the match for his job on Sergio Aguero.

But there is an alternative, which is to scan the team-sheet before kick-off and think that some poor soul like Olivier Giroud will have his work cut out today in a 4-1-4-1.

He was the real man of the match, busting his balls as he worked the line across one of the best - and certainly most expensive - defences in the Barclays Premier League.

Francis Coquelin was also possibly worthy of the man of the match accolade for his performance

It was interesting to learn that Danny Murphy - a man who really does have a full appreciation and understanding of the game - gave Giroud man of the match on talkSPORT on Monday morning, but what would he know, eh?

There are people (myself included) who will tell you that Pablo Zabaleta is the best right-back in the history of the Barclays Premier League. Let’s pause there for a moment.

Then there are City supporters who would scream at you in the street if you dare to claim that John Terry is a better central defender than their captain Vincent Kompany. Pause again.

Tougher to make a case for Martin Demichelis, but let’s not pretend he didn't win four Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich, one Premier League title with City or start the 2014 World Cup final against Germany. Pause again.

There is also Gael Clichy, a decent enough left back but without being anything special. Four, plus the formidable presence of City keeper Joe Hart, against one is not a fair fight.

Giroud still managed to play a part in the move that led to Arsenal’s opening goal and finished the game off when he read Cazorla’s free-kick to steer the ball beyond Hart.

That is why Giroud was man of the match.

The beauty about football is that it is all about opinions. And that’s mine.

But ratings should take into account far more than this

That's why Giroud was more deserving of the star man award

He took on City's daunting back line without fear and scored crucial goal
