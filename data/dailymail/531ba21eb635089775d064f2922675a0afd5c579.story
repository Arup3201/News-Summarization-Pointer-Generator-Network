Couple: The new Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, (left) has spoken of how his wife Caroline (right) keeps an eye on his drinking

The Archbishop of Canterbury has asked his wife to monitor his drinking, he admitted yesterday.

Justin Welby, who is to be enthroned as leader of the Anglican church this week, said his father had been an alcoholic and he feared going down the same road himself.

He said he has an agreement with his wife Caroline to tell him if he is drinking too much and that he takes care never to drink alone.

Dr Welby disclosed his worries in an interview in which he spoke of his father who was a bootlegger and socialite in the United States before settling in Britain.

‘You never knew what was going to happen,’ Dr Welby said.

‘The experience of living with a parent who had a drink problem is very shaping as to one’s views of what human beings are like.’

He added that his father had engaged in ‘very erratic behaviour, very irrational, dishonesty, shouting.

Then, of course, one worries how much of this is how one is going to behave oneself’. Dr Welby said his childhood experience had ‘absolutely not’ made him a teetotaller.

‘I very much enjoy a drink,’ he said. ‘I remember reading that the children of alcoholics have a much better chance themselves of having a dependency problem.

‘So Caroline and I have an agreement that she keeps an eye on me, so she’ll say if I am going over ... but I have rules myself. I don’t drink alone, things like that.’

In a wide-ranging interview in advance of his enthronement at Canterbury on Thursday, the Archbishop said he believed that sex outside marriage was wrong.

‘I have no sense of moral outrage over sexuality in any particular direction,’ he added. ‘I’m far too conscious of my own weaknesses to start hurling rocks at people.

‘My understanding of sexual ethics has been that, regardless of whether it’s gay or straight, sex outside marriage is wrong. Now that gets me into all kinds of difficulty.

We don’t have to be obsessive. The trouble is in the Church we get totally hooked on sexual sin. It’s not the thing that most concerns me.

‘People move in together, they have partners, they are not legally married; but there is a profound sense of commitment to each other, which is of intrinsic value.’

The Archbishop said the Government’s same-sex marriage plan, which is being championed by David Cameron, was ‘a bad piece  of legislation’.

He distinguished himself from his predecessor Rowan Williams – who frequently suggested that capitalism is a destructive force – by praising the work of banks.

The former oil industry chief said: ‘The efficient allocation of capital is a good, enabling companies to grow.

‘One thing I learned over years working in Africa is that the absence of financial services is a severe bad. It is not a good thing at all. It makes human flourishing and wellbeing much harder to achieve, in fact, impossible.

‘But you can do the right thing in such a way it becomes the wrong thing.’ Dr Welby said that had happened in the financial world.

He also spoke about the death of his seven-month-old daughter, Johanna, who lived for five days after being flung out of a car in a crash in France in 1983.

‘For me and Caroline, Johanna’s death and the few days after the accident and before she died were the most utter agony,’ he said.

‘Yet at the same time the presence of God was more clearly present than at any time in my life or Caroline’s. It’s a very rare day that I don’t think of Johanna.’
