Jarring video has emerged of a pilot forced to make an emergency landing after his light aircraft suffered engine failure.

Pilot Ed Bullion captured the footage earlier this month during a take-off attempt at Pitt Meadows Regional Airport near Vancouver, Canada. 

Just seconds after he lifts off, the plane's engine suddenly stops working, resulting in this terrifying clip. 

Frightening video has emerged of a pilot forced to make an emergency landing when his aircraft engine fails

During a take-off attempt at an airport outside of Vancouver, pilot Ed Buillon was faced with a terrifying reality

When the engine fails, Mr Bullion is forced to turn the plane around and make an impromptu landing in the grass next to the runway.

The camera attached to the tail of the aircraft shows the wheels underneath the plane making muddy tracks through the field as he brings the plane to safe stop.

Mr Bullion, who had taken a couple of friends on board the aircraft with him, later wrote online: 'I am very thankful that I was able to land the airplane in that circumstance and that no one was killed or injured.

'At the same time, it reminds me that anything in life can happen unexpectedly.

'So while everything is going fine, enjoy it to the fullest!'
