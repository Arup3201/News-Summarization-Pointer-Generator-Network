The broadcasting regulator has criticised Sky News after one of its star reporters was seen picking through the possessions of people killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine.

Ofcom said more than 200 people complained after Colin Brazier rifled through the victims' bags at the crash scene in July this year, three days after the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet was taken down with the loss of all 298 people on board.

Today the regulator said the live television broadcast on 20 July caused 'considerable offence' and breached its rule that says offensive material must be justified by the context.

Offensive broadcast: Sky News reporter Colin Brazier was seen picking through crash victims' possessions

An Ofcom investigation found that Brazier caused 'considerable offence' not mitigated by his apology

A report by the watchdog published this morning said: 'Ofcom received 205 complaints from viewers who were offended by Mr Brazier picking up items from the suitcase of one of the victims...

'Mr Brazier stood amongst the belongings of some of the victims of the tragedy... Having described some of the items he could see, he then crouched down and briefly picked up a water bottle and then a set of keys from an open suitcase.'

It described how he suggested the items belonged to 'a small girl... by the look of things' before almost immediately adding: 'We shouldn't really be doing this, I suppose'.

The Ofcom investigation said: 'Mr Brazier handled two items belonging to a victim of the crash very briefly, and he appeared to almost immediately regret his actions and expressed this to viewers.

'Nonetheless, in Ofcom's view these actions were capable of causing considerable offence and this was not mitigated by an immediate broadcast apology.

'On balance we therefore considered that the offence was not justified by the context and Rule 2.3 was breached.' 

However the watchdog said the breach was considered resolved after Brazier, 46, and Sky News apologised hours after the broadcast, and the reporter wrote a full apology in a newspaper two days later.

Ofcom said it also took into account the 'unusual and emotionally charged situation' Brazier found himself reporting on, and said that it meant he had to take 'particularly challenging' editorial decisions.

After the event Brazier, a father of six, said he spotted the pink drinking flask because it was identical to one possessed by his six-year-old daughter.

He then said he 'lost it' and broke down in tears while on air as he looked at the victims' possessions. 

However the older brother of Leeds University student Richard Mayne, who was one of ten Britons to die in the crash, said the television reporter's actions were 'sick'.

Speaking soon after the broadcast this summer, Thomas Mayne, 24, said: 'It's sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy.' 

Brazier is described by Sky News as one of its 'most widely travelled' reporters who has previously been honoured for his reporting in Afghanistan. 

Oftcom also said that Brazier's 'brief but significant lapse of judgement' should not prevent broadcast journalists from reporting on live and sensitive news stories in future.
