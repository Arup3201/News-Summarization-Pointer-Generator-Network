On his 1974 re-election as Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam declared Bowman Hall in Sydney's Western suburb of Blacktown as his 'Temple of Victories'.

It was from here, two years earlier, that he delivered the famous 'It's Time' election campaign speech that brought the Australian Labor party to power after 23 years.

Now, the City of Blacktown wants to honour his legacy with a new suburb and railway station called Whitlam.

'Without doubt Blacktown City is a better place thanks to Mr Whitlam, and we will forever honour him here,' said Blacktown mayor Stephen Bali. 

'It's time!' Gough Whitlam made his winning Labour election campaign speech from the stage of Blacktown's Bowman Hall in November 1972.

The Australian Electoral Commission announced a new suburb would be named in Whitlam's honour  following his recent death on October 21 at the age of 98.

Cr Bali has written to NSW Premier Mike Baird and Opposition Leader John Robertson for support for a new 'Whitlam' suburb in Blacktown's North West Growth Centre and a station on the north-west rail link, Fairfax Media reports. 

Whitlam lived in the region and 'he understood the needs of it's people,' Cr Bali said. 

'Gough Whitlam is a hero of mine: a man with an enormous vision for Australia as a place where cultures and ideas are embraced. On a very practical local level, of course he made a difference to so many people’s live,' he said. 

As well as education and public health reforms, it was Whitlam who was responsible for funding a new public hospital at Westmead and for linking the homes of Western Sydney with sewerage.

'It wasn't until 40 years ago under Gough that western Sydney came into the 20th century,' says Mayor Bali. 

'Nothing will save the Governor-General:' Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was famously dismissed from office on Remembrance Day, 1975 on the steps of Old Government House

'One of the brightest stars': Whitlam has been described as a 'reformist' and 'modernising' Prime Minister who 'left an indelible mark on Australian history'. He is also credited with putting Western Sydney 'on the map'

Whitlam, dubbed 'The Young Brolga' when he entered parliament in 1952 for his height (194 cm) and 'imperious bearing' was remembered as a 'transformative' leader and a 'giant.'  

In 1972, he led the Labor Party back to power after 23 years with a slogan for change: 'It's time'.

The upcoming election was 'a choice between the past and the future,' he told Australians from the stage at Blacktown's Bowman Hall, promising to end military conscription and Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, to provide free university education and a national health scheme.

He set about transforming the nation: Abolishing remnants of the White Australia Policy and recognising Indigenous land rights, recognising Papua New Guinea's Independence and establishing diplomatic relations with China.

Whitlam, pictured with his former arch-rival Malcolm Fraser, was a vocal member of the 1999 Yes! campaign for a republic following his dismissal by the Governor-General

Whitlam was dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr on November 11, 1975 when his government failed to pass its budget in the Senate.

'Well, we may say "God Save The Queen", but nothing will save the Governor-General,' Whitlam famously responded on the steps of what is now Old Parliament House. 

Former Liberal prime minister  Malcolm Fraser said his predecessor, and later good friend, 'had aspirations probably too large for our immediate resources.'

'But aspirations that I think touched the hearts and minds of a great many Australians. He certainly left an indelible mark on Australian history.'   

And a special one on Western Sydney's.  For Cr Bali, Blacktown City 'embodies' Gough's Australian ideals of multi-culturalism and 'the importance of working to enable all Australians to realise their potential.'
