Frank Armstrong, the former Assistant Commissioner of City of London Police, has been arrested over alleged leaks to a journalist

A former deputy chief constable who wrote a scathing report about a breach of security at Prince William’s 21st birthday party was yesterday arrested over alleged leaks to a journalist.

Frank Armstrong, 52, until recently the £130,000-a-year second in charge of City of London Police, is the first chief officer to be arrested as a result of inquiries arising from Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden – which was set up to investigate allegations of bribes paid to police officers and other public officials.

Last night the police watchdog, whose investigators arrested  Armstrong on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, stressed that ‘at this stage’, no money is alleged to have changed hands between him and the reporter.

His arrest at his home in South-West London at 7am yesterday came just two months after he was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal for distinguished service and followed an illustrious career which included a spell as head of Tony Blair’s Special Branch protection team. His arrest comes just weeks after another respected senior officer, Met Chief Superintendent Andy Rowell, was arrested over alleged disclosures of confidential information to the media.

He, too, is not suspected of receiving any payment from the media. Rowell’s arrest coincided with Home Office plans to adopt many recommendations regarding contact between the Press and police set out in the Leveson Report. Such a move would significantly weaken a journalist’s ability to resist police requests for confidential information on sources.

So far 108 people, including more than 70 journalists, have been arrested in relation to three linked inquiries launched by Scotland Yard in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. As well as the Operation Weeting inquiry into phone-hacking and Operation Elveden, a third investigation, Operation Tuleta, is looking into computer hacking and other privacy breaches.

Armstrong’s most recent job as Assistant Commissioner of City of London Police – equivalent in rank to a deputy chief constable – included responsibility for counter-terrorism and saw him oversee several highly sensitive fraud investigations.

Ten years ago, when ‘Commander’ of the same force, he rose to national prominence when he wrote a highly critical report about police failings which allowed an intruder to gatecrash Prince William’s party at Windsor Castle in 2002.

His report, which made 28 recommendations for improving the security of the Royal Family, was widely praised for not pulling punches.

Speaking in 2003, Armstrong said William’s party had been dealt with as a private event with low-key security, when in fact it should have been treated as a high-profile event.

‘Certainly this event taking place in a post-11 September world should have warranted the highest level of security,’ he said. A larger-than-life character, with a keen interest in rugby and raising money for charity, Armstrong was popular with junior officers before he left City of London Police last September to work in corporate protection.

Last night Padraig Reidy, of the campaign group Index on Censorship, said the latest arrest was ‘troubling’.

He added: ‘In the post-Leveson environment, it seems that more and more, informal contact between police officers and the Press is being outlawed. Such informal contact can have its own issues, but it is also crucially important for investigative reporting and scrutiny of the police and other authorities.’

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said its investigators had arrested a 52-year-old  on ‘suspicion of misconduct in public office in relation to the alleged passing of unauthorised information to a journalist’.
