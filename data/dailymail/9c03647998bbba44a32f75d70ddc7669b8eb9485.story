Prince Albert can hardly be blamed for keeping a tight grip on his bride-to-be.

Faced with extraordinary claims that Charlene Wittstock had tried to run away home to South Africa only days before their £50million wedding, Monaco’s ruler took her on a tour of the principality.

The idea, apparently, was to show that the wedding festivities, due to start with a concert tonight and two lavish ceremonies on Friday and Saturday, are still on.

But a confidant of the prince stoked 
speculation about what led to Miss Wittstock supposedly being stopped at
 Nice airport  trying to board a flight with a  one-way ticket last 
week.

The 33-year-old former Olympic swimmer was said to have learned a distressing revelation about the prince’s private life.  

Stéphane Bern, France’s leading 
royal TV commentator and a  close friend of 53-year-old Albert, 
suggested a woman could be  claiming to be pregnant by the prince, whose
 notorious private  life has already produced two  illegitimate 
children.

He told Le Parisien newspaper: ‘A 
woman could very well be pretending that she is pregnant by the Prince. 
We can’t carry out a DNA test to check this out just three days before 
the marriage.’  

Asked why Prince Albert had not 
issued a personal denial he replied: ‘A sovereign ruler is not going to 
lower himself to saying: “No, my fiancée did not want to leave me this 
weekend”.’

Walkabout: The couple were visiting the installations for the wedding

Wearing skinny black jeans, a white tunic,a pashmina and a black tasselled necklace, Miss Wittstock looked relaxed as she and the prince visited some of the installations being erected for their £50million wedding.

The walkabout came as it emerged that the 53-year-old royal threatened a legal battle to uncover the palace mole who threatened to destroy his big day.

Miss Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer whose father was a photocopier salesman, is said to have been stopped by police at Nice airport as she tried to board a flight with a one-way ticket.

L’Express, the Paris news magazine 
which broke the story, was today standing by it – as Prince Albert’s legal team
 made no attempt to injunct it.

Instead it is demanding that L’Express reveals its sources – providing all of its evidence for the claim, although has not officially filed a lawsuit.

This is because Albert fears further 
revelations before Friday, when the eyes of the world 
will be on Monaco at the start of his nuptials.

In turn, L’Express editor-in-chief 
Renaud Revel confirmed that no attempt had been made to get the story 
removed from the magazine’s website.

Mr Revel, a highly respected author 
and investigative journalist, said he would make sure that the 
confidentiality of his sources was protected at all costs.

‘There had been all kinds of threats against us, but nothing has been filed in court and it won’t be,’ a source at the magazine added,

Colleagues at L’Express include 
Christophe Barbier, the editorial director, who is a close personal 
friend of French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.

‘These men are top class, hugely well
 connected journalists, and they know exactly what they’re writing 
about,’ said the source.

‘They have superb sources and 
would give them up to no one, not even an angry prince.'

‘Albert is desperate to find the palace mole because he fears further revelations. His lawyers are 
working overtime to try and find out who has been talking, but the truth
 is that the whole of Monaco is abuzz with rumours.’

Prince Albert has fathered two 
illegitimate children – six-year-old Alexandre, the son of Nicole Coste,
 a former Air France air hostess from Togo, and Jazmin, 19, whose 
mother is Tamara Rotola, an American estate agent.

A pregnant woman may be preparing to name Prince Albert as the father of her unborn baby days before his wedding, one of his closest confidantes said today.

Stephane Bern, France’s leading royal TV commentator and a close friend and advisor of the Prince, has told Le Parisien newspaper there could be yet another love child expected soon.

Mr Bern said: ‘A woman could very well be pretending that she is pregnant by the Prince.

‘We can’t carry out a DNA test to check this out just three days before the marriage! The problem is that we can makes claims, and then contradict them to no avail.

‘There are people who prefer to tarnish a happy event. For once there is (a happy event) in a family which has experienced so much misfortune - leave them in peace!’

Albert has two illegitimate children by two former girlfriends, but always denied they were his until scientific analysis proved otherwise.

In both cases, DNA tests were needed before Albert admitted he was the father, and agreed to pay for their upbringings.

The unspecified L’Express revelations
 are believed to relate to Albert’s tangled love life, but his lawyer 
Thierry Lacoste has described them as ‘madness’, adding: ‘Everything is 
false.’

Mr Lacoste confirmed he was taking 
legal action to uncover L’Express’s sources, adding: ‘I was with the 
Prince and Charlene Wittstock in Paris three days ago, and I can promise
 you that all is well.’

The extraordinary allegations emerged just two days before the extravagant three-day celebrations for the wedding are to start.

The
 guest list includes the Earl and Countess of Wessex, as well as 
President Nicolas Sarkozy, Naomi Campbell, Karl Lagerfeld, Giorgio 
Armani, Richard Branson, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and business tycoon 
Philip Green.

The Eagles will perform at a concert to celebrate the wedding tomorrow and the civil ceremony takes place on Friday.

A religious ceremony will be held on 
Saturday in a 13th century church and will be attended by royalty from all over 
Europe. After that comes a white tie ball.

Now the royal wedding plans are at risk of being overshadowed by the astonishing claims.

But Albert, whose previous girlfriends have included Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer, has weathered such storms before.

A source in Monaco said: ‘Albert is absolutely furious about the latest claims and will be taking legal action against L’Express.

‘He’s had a turbulent private life, and doesn’t need this just a few days before his big day.’

An official statement from the palace said: ‘The Prince’s Palace firmly denies the allegations.

‘These rumours, spread a few days 
before the wedding ceremonies of H.S.H. Prince Albert and Miss Charlene 
Wittstock, have only one purpose – to seriously damage the Sovereign’s 
image and by consequence that of Miss Wittstock and to cause serious 
prejudice to a happy event.’
