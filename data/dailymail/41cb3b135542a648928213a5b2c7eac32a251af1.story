Stan Stanridge (picutred) has accused Abilene schools super Harry Burns of trying to cover up allegations into sex abuse by teachers, and of impeding four of his investigations

A senior Texas police officer has accused a school superintendent of trying to cover up allegations that four teachers had sex with pupils by investigating the crimes himself.

Stan Standridge, Abilene Police Chief, said local school superintendent Heath Burns interrogated staff himself before involving police, and has tried to trip up investigators ever since.

Mr Standridge also accused Mr Burns of censoring his complaints after he was barred from a school board meeting on Monday, where he planned to discuss his concerns with trustees.

Police began their inquiries into the Abilene Independent Schools District in December last year after Michael Trook, 29, the dean of Holland Medical High School, was arrested.

Trook has since admitted having sex  with a 17-year-old pupil in his office on December 10 last year and has left his post at the school.

On Tuesday this week Breanne Brown, 30, a teacher at Abilene High, was also taken into custody amid allegations she had sex with a 16-year-old pupil on ten separate occasions.

However, police  have since alleged that Brown was interviewed  by Mr Burns about her behaviour months before they caught up with her.

They say the intervention by Mr Burns shows he was trying to cover up the offences, and did nothing to stop her crimes, as she allegedly carried on her tryst with the student.

Cops are investigating two more staff members over claims they were also having sex with students, but have not released any more details.

At the time of Trook's arrest Mr Burns said he was 'looking forward to working closely with Abilene police' to get to the bottom of the allegations, but relations have since broken down. 

Tempers first flared in public on December 20 when cops tried to raid two school premises linked to Trook's arrest.

Papers filed at the time reveal cops were after a cell phone that allegedly contained pictures of Trook's genitals sent to the victim, and computers on the school campus.

However, shortly after the raids Mr Stanridge issued a statement saying his officers had been barred from removing evidence by Mr Burns, and that his investigation was being hampered.

Mr Burns strenuously denied these claims, saying he was just trying to follow proper procedure. 

The argument between the pair came to a head on Monday, when Standridge was denied access to an open meeting of the Abilene Independent Schools District board.

He was going to use the meet to discuss concerns with the probes and to update school trustees on progress, but was told he would have to make do with a private meet with Mr Burns instead.

Mr Burns attempted to justify the move on legal grounds, but it left Standridge furious.

The police chief called a news conference for Tuesday afternoon at which he called out Mr Burns, saying he would be filing a formal complaint over his behaviour.

Mr Standridge says Mr Burns interviewed Brown while she was still at Abilene High (pictured) about her alleged crimes in an attempt to cover them up. Cops say she went on to reoffend before they caught her

He said: 'Let me be perfectly clear. I have a personnel complaint related to the performance of Dr. Heath Burns. Instead of involving the police department, he chose to interview the teacher.'

That prompted Mr Burns to call his own news conference, saying that he was aware a meeting would have to take place, 'even if it is not on my terms'.

However he defended his decision to block Stanridge from Monday's discussion, saying that addressing the board in full open session was not the only way to make a complaint known.

Police are continuing their investigations. Since being arrested Brown has resigned from her position at Abilene High.
