Hundreds of Scottish nationalists renewed their attack on the BBC at a rally in Glasgow tonight.

Up to 500 independence supporters gathered in the city's George Square two days ahead of the historic referendum set to take place on Thursday.

The crowds repeatedly chanted 'BBC, shame on you' as a series of speakers delivered arguments in favour of independence.

Chaotic: Protesters spoke out in favour of breaking up the UK at the event ahead of Thursday's referendum

The rally comes shortly after a group of up to 1,000 protesters marched on the headquarters of BBC Scotland, accusing the Corporation of bias in its referendum coverage.

Anger has particularly focused on the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, who clashed with Alex Salmond in a fiery interview last week.

At this evening's event, the Yes supporters chanted 'Where's the cameras, BBC?' and 'You can shove your TV licence up your a***.'

The crowds, which also sang 500 Miles by the Scottish band the Proclaimers and several renditions of Flower of Scotland, gathered around 6pm and had largely dispersed within an hour and a half.

Speakers included comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli and Deacon Blue's lead singer Ricky Ross.

Warning: The event's organiser asked supporters to ensure that it passed off peacefully

Passion: The Yes campaign has long been much more vocal than opponents of independence

Prior to the event, organiser Martin Compston, an actor who starred in Monarch of the Glen, pleaded for calm after a series of unpleasant attacks on anti-independence politicians and campaigners by nationalist supporters.

Speaking at the event, Mr Compston said: 'I wanted to get people together, one thing I want to stress is this is not a celebration yet but it's about invigorating people.

'I felt that it was being portrayed that the Yes campaign was quite negative so I was keen for people to come together and show how positive it is.'

Supporter Josephine Howe, 54, said she would vote for independence despite being a lifelong Labour voter.

All smiles: Fans of independence attempted to dispel the image of intimidation associated with the Yes side

'I wanted to take part and show my solidarity with other voters,' she said.

'The amount of people getting involved in politics again has been great, my 16-year-old granddaughter knows more about politics than I do and she can't wait to vote.

'I was Labour all my life and so was my dad and my grandfather but so many supporters just don't trust then anymore and they want a change, and the SNP have done a good job of making their case.'

Banners at Sunday's demonstration described the BBC as the 'British Biased Corporation', with one placard saying the corporation was 'anti-democracy, anti-truth'.

Anger: Several of those attending the event said they felt let down by the Labour party

Flag-waving: Many of those attending had saltire flags and other campaign paraphernalia

The event raised alarm among some campaigners, who have suggested that the Yes campaign is using intimidatory tactics to suppress opposition.

Mr Robinson was accused of 'heckling' Mr Salmond at a press conference last week as he repeatedly pushed the First Minister to explain the economic consequences of Scottish independence.

The fiery exchange came after the BBC reported that Royal Bank of Scotland was set to move its headquarters to London, quoting anonymous Government sources.

Asked by the Sunday Herald whether he thought the BBC was biased, Mr Salmond said: 'Yes, absolutely. Of course it is.

'The problem with Nick... I mean, don't get me wrong, I like these folk, but they don't realise they're biased. It's the unconscious bias which is the most extraordinary thing of all.'
