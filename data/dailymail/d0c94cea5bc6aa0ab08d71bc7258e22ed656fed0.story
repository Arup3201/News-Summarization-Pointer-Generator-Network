Tragic: Newborn Jessica Strong was one of two newborn babies who died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire after contracting a rare killer bug

Two premature babies died because staff on an NHS hospital ward did not wash their hands properly, an inquest heard.

Jessica Strong was just 11 days old when she died after contracting a bug spread from another child also being treated at the hospital.

A ‘breakdown in hand hygiene’ meant six babies became infected, with Jessica and one other killed as a result.

Jessica’s mother Annette this week told an inquest of her heartbreak at losing her daughter because of the ‘disgraceful’ staff at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

The new, £400million ‘super hospital’ has now admitted negligence contributed to the deaths of the two babies.

The inquest heard how an outbreak of the bacteria Serratia Marcescens swept through the hospital’s neonatal ward in June last year, after it was introduced to the ward by a baby transferred from a hospital in Wales.

The first infant who had the bug and three others developed no symptoms but Jessica and another baby, who has not yet been named, died after becoming infected.

North Staffordshire coroner’s court heard how Jessica was transferred to the hospital in Stoke-on-Trent after she was born three months prematurely at George Eliot hospital in her parents’ home town of Nuneaton.

She was making good progress but her condition suddenly declined and doctors found traces of the bug just 12 hours before she died.

She was immediately given a stronger antibiotic but it was too late to tackle the infection.

Despite two blood transfusions, it swept through to her spleen, lungs and brain.
Annette Strong, 43, told the hearing: ‘She had been doing so well staff were trying to transfer her home.

‘Then I got a call that she had deteriorated and they had resuscitated 
her. I rushed back to the hospital and the day before she died I had her
baptised.

‘I was at her cot-side and she had her eyes wide open and seemed to recognise my voice.

‘But by then it was clear she would not make it so I gave her a last cuddle. She was my beautiful little dot.’

Staff at the hospital claimed the infection could have been spread 
either by staff or parents.  But Mrs Strong believes staff at the 
hospital are to blame.

‘There is no way one parent could’ve contracted it and passed it on to six other babies,’ she said.

‘I believe that the infection has been spread by a member of staff. It’s disgraceful and upsetting.’

Infection: Doctors said the Serratia Marcescens infection had been brought in by a baby which was transferred a month earlier to one of the unit's 23 cots from a hospital in Wales

The mother-of-two later revealed the family have instructed solicitors to take legal action against the trust.

Mrs Strong and her husband Craig are expecting another baby girl in June this year.

Speaking about her pregnancy she said: ‘It’s absolutely fantastic but 
Jessica will never ever in our hearts be replaced,’ she added.

The University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust has admitted clinical negligence over Jessica’s death.

Since the deaths it has started a new cleaning regime and has employed three nurses to ensure better standards of hygiene.

Staff from the hospital’s neonatal unit told coroner Ian Smith they were devastated they may have contributed to the deaths.

Neonatologist Dr Kate Palmer said: ‘This has very much hurt the staff 
but it has been a wake-up call and brought a sea change in attitude and 
culture to infection which now permeates everything we do.’

Lead infection control nurse Emyr Phillips added: ‘While previous audits
on the unit going back years showed excellent results, there was a 
clear breakdown in hand hygiene practice which could have been caused by
staff or parents.’

Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Smith said Jessica’s death was caused 
by ‘extreme prematurity and infection spread by hand contact’.

An inquest has yet to be held into the death of the other baby on the ward, who died at 22 days old.
