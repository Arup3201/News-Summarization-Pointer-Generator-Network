The Mail can today reveal the millions paid to rail bosses who run Britain’s costly and overcrowded train services.

While passengers struggle with ever-rising fares, senior rail executives enjoyed generous salaries, bonuses and perks such as car allowances and private healthcare.

The highest paid boss even earned £2.2million despite operating the country’s most crowded commuter service, a Daily Mail investigation reveals.

Hard-pressed commuters faced rail chaos in London after planned engineering works over-ran

Thousands of travellers were left stranded as hundreds of services were cancelled on Boxing Day

The most successful train operator parent company made pre-tax profits of nearly £700million while the companies that run the transport network take billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies.

The stark contrast between ‘cattle class’ commuters and the ‘Fat Controllers’ follows the Christmas chaos in which thousands of passengers suffered horrendous journeys caused by over-running engineering works by Network Rail.

Yet hard-pressed commuters returning to work in the New Year will see the overall cost of their train fares rise by 2.2 per cent from Friday – and up 2.5 per cent for season tickets.

Many will see the price of an annual ticket top £5,000 for the first time, including passengers who travel from Ashford in Kent to London.

Commuters on the Brighton to London will pay £4,408 a year – a rise of £745, or 20 per cent, in four years.

Meanwhile, rail firms benefited from a total of £4.02billion in government subsidies in 2012-13, according to figures from the Office of Rail Regulation watchdog. At the same time the firms paid £204million in dividends to their parent companies, many of which are owned by foreign governments.

The top-paid rail manager last year was Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths, 48, who received £2.23million, including £22,000 in lieu of a company car.

His company runs East Midland Trains and South West Trains, which operates Britain’s most crowded commuter service – the 7.32am Woking to Waterloo, on which travellers must now pay £3,052 for an annual season ticket.

Britain's rail bosses are paid between £197,800 and £2.23 million a year according to a Mail investigation

First Group’s American chief executive Tim O’Toole, 59, received £1.99million last year even though a third of shareholders voting against his bumper pay packet – which included a £12,000 car allowance and £16,447 for US private medical insurance for himself and his wife.

A company spokesman said his bonus last year was the first he had taken since becoming chief executive in 2010 and reflected ‘operational improvements’.

David Brown, 54, was paid £1.96million last year to run Go-Ahead and lives with his family in a five-bedroom house worth £1.8million in Ealing, west London.

With French partner Keolis the firm runs train operator Govia. Operators under his command include Thameslink – whose manager Charles Horton sparked fury in October when he said he hoped to make it ‘more comfortable to stand’ for rush-hour passengers.

A Go-Ahead spokesman said executive pay is decided by board members and was a ‘unanimous view’ of the remuneration committee.’ National Express Group chief executive Dean Finch, 48, received a package of more than £1.5million, including £20,000 for a car, plus health insurance.

He and his wife live in a beauty spot in rural Aberdeenshire, where they have a £1.6million listed home. National Express, which runs C2C, said it did not receive a subsidy – and said Mr Finch’s pay was down on the previous year. Last night it also emerged that passengers have seen their pay massively outstripped by season ticket price rises.

Average salaries have risen by 6.9 per cent since January 2010, but many fares have increased by 22 per cent or more over this period, the Campaign for Better Transport said. Labour’s shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said the franchising system is ‘not fit for purpose’ and called for an approach that ‘puts the public interest first’.

Manuel Cortes, of the TSSA rail union, added: ‘Passengers get all the pain while the bosses get all the gain.’ The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators and Network Rail, said the overall increase in fares of 2.2 per cent is the lowest in five years.

The Department for Transport admitted there were ‘concerns’ by passengers over the cost of rail travel. But it said increases to regulated fares – set by the government – were once again frozen by George Osborne at 2.5 per cent.

This week’s annual fare rise will mean some season ticket holders will have endured increases of more than 20% in the life of this Parliament, according to figures from the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT).

The latest rise, which takes effect on Friday, will see regulated fares, which include season tickets, increasing by up to 2.5 per cent and fares overall going up by an average of 2.2 per cent.

Those commuting to London from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, for example, will have to contend with a 2.43 per cent rise, with their 2015 ticket going up to £4,888.

According to CBT, the cost of a Milton Keynes season ticket has risen 23.5 per cent, or £930, since January 2010 and is one of a number of fares that have increased around four times more than average wages over this five-year period.

The CBT also highlighted the cost of a Newcastle to Middlesbrough season ticket, which will be £2,324 from Friday and has risen 26.3 per cent since January 2010.

Other examples of large increases on season tickets since January 2010 given by CBT are Ashford International to London (up 22.0 per cent), Oxford-London (up 22.0 per cent), St Albans-London (up 22.0 per cent), Leeds-Sheffield (up 23.5 per cent), Leicester-Derby (up 22.5 per cent) and Bristol-Bath (up 22.4 per cent).

CBT said average wages had risen by just 6.9 per cent since January 2010.

CBT’s public transport campaigner Martin Abrams said: 'Yet again, the Government is hiking up commuter rail fares. Ticket prices are rising much faster than wages, which means getting to work takes up an increasing share of incomes, hitting both household budgets and the economy.

'The Government urgently needs to adopt a fairer approach to ticketing, bringing fares down and introducing more flexible tickets to help groups like the millions who work part-time.'

Rail union the RMT has also bemoaned the fare rise, which comes at a time when commuters have had to contend with constant late autumn and early winter disruptions to rush-hour services.

Last weekend overrunning Christmas engineering work led to chaotic scenes at King’s Cross and Finsbury Park stations in north London and threw the spotlight on Network Rail’s top bosses’ salary levels and bonus structure.

The RMT published figures which it said showed that Government subsidies to train companies came to just over £4 billion in 2012/13.

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'As the travelling public gear up for the new year fares hike, we are blowing away the myth that the extra cash is invested back into services when in fact it combines with taxpayer subsidies to fuel a £4 billion privatised rail rip-off that is a one-way ticket to the bank for the train companies.'

He went on: 'The scandal of the British people paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out and overcrowded trains will be compounded by the new year average rise - an increase which dwarfs average pay increases and which will hit the poorest the hardest.'

Mr Cash said the RMT would step up the fight for the renationalisation of the railways. 

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said today: 'We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation since the Victorian era and fares have a crucial role to play in funding these improvements. This is because building better infrastructure helps create jobs, building a stronger economy for us all.

'We recognise passengers’ concerns about the cost of rail fares. This is why we have frozen them for the second year in a row. We are protecting passengers even further by stopping operating companies from increasing individual fares by up to 2 per cent more.”

Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, said: 'Chancellor George Osborne has yet again frozen fuel duty for motorists and with oil prices falling dramatically, motoring is becoming cheaper in real terms and rail travel becoming more expensive.

'So don’t be surprised if road congestion gets even worse along with pollution, accidents and global warming.'

He went on: 'Fares need to reflect reality in terms of inflation, and with the most recent figures for CPI inflation just 1 per cent and falling, this represents yet another unfair squeezing of rail passengers’ wallets.

'There’s a real danger that further fare increases will deter passengers from travelling and reduce the rail industry’s income, increasing the support required from government.' 

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators and Network Rail, said: 'At 2.2 per cent, the average increase in fares in 2015 is the lowest for five years.

'We know that no one likes to pay more to go to work, but for every £1 spent on fares, 97p goes on track, train, staff and other costs while 3p goes in profits earned by train companies for running services on Europe’s fastest-growing railway.

'While we know and are very sorry that many passengers did not get the service they deserved at the weekend, Network Rail is spending £38 billion over five years on a better railway alongside commitments made by train companies to improve services.'
