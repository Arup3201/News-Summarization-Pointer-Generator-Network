As many as 100 guests attending an NAACP gala over the weekend fell ill after having dinner at a luxury San Fransico hotel and were seen throwing up in the lobby.

George Holland heads the civil rights organization's Oakland chapter and was among several hundred people at the soiree held at the Sofitel San Francisco Bay Hotel in Redwood City.

Officials say 12 people were taken by ambulance to hospitals to be treated for dehydration.

Witnesses described a horrible and upsetting scene involving people suffering from severe vomiting and diarrhea 

Others made their way to the hospital on their own Saturday and Sunday after experiencing severe vomiting and diarrhea.

Robyn Thaw, a spokeswoman for the San Mateo Medical Center, tells the Oakland Tribune an initial investigation by county officials found no violations linked to foodborne illnesses at the hotel.

Officials are now interviewing those who became ill and reviewing their lab work to try to determine the source.

Some 300 people, among them former mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown and former mayor of Oakland Elihu Harris, attended the banquet celebrating the closing of the 27th annual NAACP State Convention.

According to George Holland, several guests, including Mr Harris, fell ill after enjoying a dinner of salmon and salad at the grand ballroom of the hotel.

By 10.30pm, dozens of people were vomiting all over the hotel lobby as paramedics were trying to tend to them.

Former Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, pictured here with Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker last year, was among the attendees who came down with food poisoning 

‘It was a terrible scene,’ Holland tells the Tribune. ‘Other hotel guests were very upset.’

Mr Holland added that many of the guests who succumbed to the mystery malady were children, among them a 5-year-old girl.

Holland himself also came down with the stomach bug along with his wife.

Sandra Pinto Duhamel, of the French hotel chain Accor Hotels that operates the Sofitel, said in a statement to CBS San Francisco: ‘While we do not know the cause of the illness, we are cooperating with Health Department officials at this time.

‘We remain very concerned about the well-being of the guests who became sick and wish them a speedy recovery.’
