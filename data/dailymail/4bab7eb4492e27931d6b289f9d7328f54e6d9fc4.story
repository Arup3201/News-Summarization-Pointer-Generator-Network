Thousands of Israeli and Palestinian supporters have pledged their support for both Israel and Palestine at large protest rallies in Sydney.

Within hours of each other, thousands of people flocked to separate gatherings to raise awareness about their respective cases in the escalating Middle East conflict.

Mothers and children waved graphic photographs of the Gaza conflict's casualties and others held up baby dolls with red splotches as thousands surrounded Town Hall in the Sydney CBD to draw attention to Palestine's plight.

Academic Peter Slezak told the crowd as a Jew he was deeply horrified about what the Jewish state was doing in their name.

'We are witnessing not a war but a large-scale atrocity and barbarity on the people of Gaza by Israel,' the University of NSW professor said.

'It's not anti-Jewish to be critical of Israel, it's for humanity.'

A woman was forced to defend herself after someone confronted her about the Islam symbol-bearing bands her three sons wore across their faces.

The same symbols have been brandished by the radical Islamist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

'It's labelled for the whole Islam community but they look at in a different purpose because of what the media has exposed,' she told AAP.

Three hours before, heavy security surrounded a Dover Heights park in Sydney's eastern suburbs as a blue and white sea of 10,000 people deplored the loss of life in the conflict.

Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Robert Goot said Israel's defence of its citizens had released an outpouring of antagonism '... and open Jew hatred, the likes of which have not been seen in Europe since the early 1930s'.

'But what would the world have Israel do?' he told the rally.

'Israel, like any other responsible nation, must defend its citizens while taking care of innocents in harm's way.

'No one would put up with it and nor should Israel.'

Mr Goot said Israel had taken unprecedented steps to minimise civilian casualties.

'And they probably feel shamed to hold it, but I don't feel shamed to hold it because I know that it's for the one-ness of God.'
