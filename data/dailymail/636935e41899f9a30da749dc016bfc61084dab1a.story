The elder daughters of Australia's wealthiest woman have pleaded for bodyguards, a cook and cash in the lead-up to taking her to court over the family trust, new documents reveal.

Heiress Gina Rinehart, dubbed the Iron Lady, has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with three of her four children, John, Bianca and Hope, over the family fortune left by her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock.

Perth-based Ms Rinehart, 57, tried to get details of the rift suppressed with court reporting restrictions on security grounds that it would put her at risk of extortion but she was unsuccessful.

And now embarrassing email correspondence, dating from July and August last year, between Ms Rinehart and two of her daughters has revealed the details of their row after they were tendered in to the New South Wales Supreme Court yesterday.

The emails lift the lid on their secret lives of luxury and offers the first real insight into Australia's richest family.

In one email, daughter Hope Rinehart Welker emailed her mother asking for $225,000 for a chef to prepare 'detailed menus and food for most or all family and social events' as a birthday present.

The 26-year-old wrote: 'I need a few things for my birthday (cook so you can be sure April is fed right, bodyguard so the kids are safe and housekeeper that is good kids so if I need to go out I can) and I found a great agency here that sources the best, here are the descriptions and costs, I would buy them myself but I'm down to my last $60 000 and your only paying my husband $1 a year.' 

Ms Welker, who lives in New York, 
also complained that her mother had tried to get her to move to 
Singapore or Australia to save money.

She
continued: 'I don't want to have to move back to one of your 
'desirable' countries again just to save every cent...it's not fair you 
are selfishly pressuring me to move to Singapore and Australia just 
because you hate America.'

And another daughter, Bianca Rinehart, 31, who lives in Vancouver, also requested a bodyguard.

She wrote to her mother: 'We are, by all accounts, the highest risk family in all of Australia for future similar attacks.

'I would like to have security personnel present as you have with Kevin. Unfortunately I do not have the financial means to achieve this and ask that you consider sponsoring such an arrangement or please makes funds available.'

Ms Welker also complained about the 'peer pressure' that comes with being a member of one of the country's richest families - adding that her mother 'didn't understand'.

She said: 'I don't think you understand what it means now that the whole world thinks you're going to be wealthier than Bill Gates - it means we all need bodyguards and very safe homes!! I should have enough money to have a bodyguard, housekeeper and cook. Even my friends who have nothing compared to your wealth have more staff.'

Ms Rinehart, whose fortune from her minerals empire more than doubled in 2011 to A$10.3 billion (£6.8 billion) because of a commodities boom, has tried desperately to suppress publication of details of her dispute with three of her four children. She is said to shun the limelight and is bound to be mortified about the contents of the emails.

It was revealed in September last year that Ms Rineheart was being sued by her children for control of the family trust. Only one of her three children, daughter Ginia Rinehart, has taken her mother's side. 

The rise of the 'Pilbara Princess'

Australian Gina Rinehart could soon become the world's wealthiest woman after amassing an $18billion fortune from mining and media investments, Forbes magazine said in its latest list of the wealthiest people in Australia.

The 57-year-old widow saw her fortune almost double after a deal signed last month that will see South Korean steel giant POSCO take a 15 per cent stake in her Roy Hill iron ore mine in Western Australia's Pilbara iron belt.

The deal valued the project at $10billion, boosting Rinehart's fortune dramatically.

In the next few years, Rinehart also has plans to expand her iron ore operations and develop two coal collieries.

If
commodity prices hold up, Rinehart could challenge Christie Walton, 
worth $24.5billion as the world's richest woman, Forbes said.

Christie Walton is the widow of John Walton, one of the sons of Sam Walton, the founder of retail chain Wal-Mart Stores .

For now, Rinehart will have to be content with being the Asia-Pacific region's wealthiest woman, based on Forbes' tally.

Rinehart
is the daughter of Lang Hancock, an Australian prospector credited with
discovering giant deposits of iron ore in the 1950s that now make up 
Australia's largest export base.

China alone relies of Australian iron ore for nearly half its imports of the key steel-making ingredient, and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also are big buyers for their steel mills.

Known as the 'Pilbara Princess', Rinehart is also building stakes in some of Australia's largest media companies, drawing comparisons to another famously powerful Australian, Rupert Murdoch, head of News Corp and now a U.S. citizen.

Rinehart this week became the largest shareholder in Fairfax Media by more than tripling her stake in the newspaper, digital and radio broadcasting company.

She already owns 10 per cent of rival Ten Network Holdings.
