Dr Samina Tahseen, who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient, has been cleared to work again without supervision

A doctor who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient - leaving the woman unable to conceive naturally - is now free to return to work.

The patient lost both her fallopian tubes within three days after Dr Samina Tahseen mistook a benign tumour for the ectopic pregnancy she was supposed to remove.

The gynaecologist failed to see the patient before her operation, read her medical records or properly examine her during the procedure on September 21, 2010.

She then insisted she had removed the correct fallopian tube and sent the patient home despite the woman knowing something was desperately wrong.

Dr Tahseen was allowed to continue to work under conditions despite being found guilty of serious misconduct by a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel two years ago.

The panel said the medic put her patient's 'life at risk' by discharging her with an untreated ectopic pregnancy, which later ruptured.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes. The pregnancy can cause life-threatening bleeding if left untreated.

The patient - called Patient A during the disciplinary proceedings - had to return to the Royal Derby Hospital three days after the botched operation to have her other fallopian tube removed.

A standards hearing in 2012 found the doctor had been 'hasty, careless, and dismissive' before, during and after the procedure and her actions had 'undermined public confidence in the medical profession'.

Dr Tahseen was made subject to a string of conditions, which restricted her practise and kept her closely monitored by the General Medical Council.

But those conditions have now been revoked, after the MPTS found she is now fit to practise again.

Panel chair Dr Harvey Marcovitch said: 'It [the panel] considers that you have now accepted responsibility for your misconduct, both in relation to Patient A and your relationships with colleagues,

'The panel has read the supportive testimonials from colleagues, who have noted marked improvements in your communication and collaboration, for example in taking advice when appropriate and that you have demonstrated insight into your behaviour and practice.

Dr Tahseen appeared before another standards panel earlier this month, which found she is now fit to practise

He added: 'The panel now considers that the behavioural concerns arising from your misconduct have been remedied; that you have demonstrated full insight into that misconduct and that you fully appreciate the impact of your behaviour on colleagues and the impact on Patient A of your actions.

'It considers that there is no risk of recurrence of similar misconduct.

'Furthermore, public confidence in the profession has been maintained and proper standards upheld in consequence of the restrictions on your practice that have applied for the last four years.

'Taking into account all the evidence, the Panel has determined that your fitness to practise is not currently impaired.

'Accordingly, the conditions imposed on your registration are revoked with immediate effect.'

Dr Tahseen is now free to return to work without restrictions.
