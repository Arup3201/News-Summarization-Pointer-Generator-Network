McLaughlin is the mother of two young children and she lost another 5-year-old son, Zane, in a tragic boating accident six years ago, the Herald Sun reported.

She had been friends with Mr Stevens, his 25-year-old sister Skye Strutton said.

Facebook photos on her profile show the pair posing and tagged together.

One picture posted in March shows Mr Stevens looking at McLaughlin as she pokes her tongue out.

On Tuesday, a friend posted a comment on the picture saying: 'So sad, what happened I don't understand.'

In January last year McLaughlin posted a picture of herself with the caption 'Home', and she tagged that she was with Mr Stevens in Bonbeach, Victoria

Mr Stevens' sister Skye Strutton said his family was in shock following the death of the concreter, who also enjoyed drawing and playing music

Ms Strutton said McLaughlin had been to her mother's house for dinner a number of times.

She added that the family was in shock following the death of the concreter, who also enjoyed drawing and playing music.

'He was someone we looked up to and cherished very much,' she told the Herald Sun.

McLaughlin was remanded in custody to reappear in court on February 18

'We are all in shock and somewhat in denial that it was our Graham who was taken from this earth.'

On Tuesday Magistrate Andrew Capell noted it was McLaughlin's first time in custody and ordered she be seen by a doctor.

He also ordered that CCTV footage be prepared as part of the prosecution case.

McLaughlin was remanded in custody to reappear in court on February 18.
