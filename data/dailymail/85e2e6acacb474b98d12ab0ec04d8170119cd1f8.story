Elvis's daughter Lisa Marie Presley will tell a court that her ex-husband Michael Jackson feared he would die of a drugs overdose, as her father had done.

Ms Presley, 45, has agreed to take the stand in a $40 billion (£25 billion) case surrounding Jackson’s death in 2009.

Jackson’s mother and children are suing concert promoters AEG claiming executives hired medic Dr Conrad Murray to do ‘whatever it took’ to get Jackson ready for a series of concerts at London’s O2 arena.

They claim the company was negligent in hiring the doctor and therefore responsible for Jackson’s death.

Jackson, who was 50, died weeks before the concerts.

Murray was sentenced to four years in jail for involuntary manslaughter in 2011.

A family source said: ‘Lisa called (Jackson’s mother Katherine) after his death and said he often spoke about how he didn’t want to end up like Elvis.’

Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley married in May 1994.They became close when she supported through allegations of child molestation.

The pair married in the Dominican Republic but kept it secret for several months. The marriage lasted for less than two years and ended in an amicable divorce.
