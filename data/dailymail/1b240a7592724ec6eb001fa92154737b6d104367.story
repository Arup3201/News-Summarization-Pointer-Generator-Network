The teenage star of The Girl With Half a Face has undergone surgery to transform her appearance.

Sarah Atwell, 17, from Nova Scotia, Canada, was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at eight months old, a genetic condition that has caused a large tumor to consume the right side of her face.

Now, in a one-hour documentary that will air tonight on Discovery Fit & Health, Sarah is seen undergoing a four-hour procedure that will change her life.

While the results from the surgery remain to be seen this evening, Sarah has revealed that she is delighted by the results.

Describing the moment that she looked in the mirror for the first time, she told Fox News: 'I
 was pretty happy, because I had straight lips.

'I kept 
looking in the mirror and taking pictures of myself. My mom and 
neighbors were shocked.  We sent my dad pictures, and he was really 
happy.  He said as long as I'm happy, he's happy.'

But the surgery was not without serious risk of blood loss - a fact that Sarah was all too aware of. The documentary shows her anxiously waiting at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre with her mother beforehand as her surgeon, Dr Steven Morris, maps the skin he will remove from her face.

'The principle 
of our surgical approach is to maintain normal tissue so the skin is 
fairly normal,' he said.

'The nerves are very abnormal, so [typically] there might be a fine wisp of a nerve fiber, but when it 
grows in neurofibromatosis, it might be as big as a pencil. So we're 
trying to maintain normal nerve function and trying to preserve normal 
structure.'

The plastic surgeon admitted that Sarah's tumor was an extreme case.

'When she first came to see me, the lesion 
really occupied the whole of her right face; it was growing all around 
her eye,' he said.

School 'sucks': Discovery Fit & Health also records some of the bullying that Sarah experiences at school, such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis

'She'd had a couple of previous de-bulking 
procedures, but [the tumor] went from her nose to the ear on the right, 
and the skin hung down off of her jawbone. It was an enormous 
overgrowth of abnormal tissue.'

While the most significant surgical procedure has now taken place, the work to Sarah's face is not yet over. Nor can surgeons promise that the tumor won't grow back.

'The
 next procedure will be to de-bulk the tumor around her eye,' Dr Morris 
said. 'Her eye had some sight in it, but it wasn't a great amount of 
sight. The tough challenge is what to do with eye and reshape the eye 
socket.'

Emotional: Sarah conquered at least part of the pain associated with her disfigurement with a 2012 YouTube video in which she hit out at her bullies

Sarah, who has been badly bullied her whole life, initially shot to fame in 2012 after posting a video to Facebook in which 
she made her intentions to live a happy life clear no matter what the 
bullies called her.

In a series of cards held up to the camera, she says: 'I have a tumor, that’s all. . . I wish people could understand there is nothing wrong with me.

Another reads: 'I get called names all the time. . . Bitch, slut, fat face, fat, ugly - it hurts.

‘Maybe one day the bullying will stop, but until then I’m going to be STRONG,’ one of the last cards says.

The impact of that post was bigger than she could have ever imagined.

Fighting back: Sarah posted a video on Facebook in which she 
reveals how the cruel and hurtful taunts she hears at school have affected her

Revealing her pain: At 16, she'd had enough. 'I was tired of being bullied and I put in on Facebook' she said

Trying to stay strong: Sarah's touching candor won her millions of internet fans almost overnight

‘The next day I got up and my inbox was over 1,000 messages or more from people,’ Sarah told ABC News. ‘It felt pretty good.’

Neurofibromatosis is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born.

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured.However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head.

The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome.

However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive.

Among
those viewers was a producer from 
Discovery, and so began the TV documentation of the young girl’s life.

Of her tumor, she says: 'It grew with me as I grew. In my right ear, it's kinda hard to hear sometimes, because [the tumor] pulls everything down. And my right eye, it's just blur.'

Discovery Fit & Health also records some of the bullying that Sarah experiences at school, such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis.

'Almost every day at school sucks,' she admits. 'My class photo keeps going missing. Someone takes it, I don't know why. And it hurts. . .

'There's some kids that will call me names and threaten to kill me. . .'

Her teacher, Sarah Lockhart, echoed this.

'Sarah's been bullied most of her life - being called names, being made fun of,' she said. 'She keeps to herself, but we do know that it does affect her life every day.'

Sarah laid bare her feelings in a video diary, by way of a coping mechanism, and from there, her viral YouTube/Facebook post was a natural step forward.

Sarah
 says that she hopes to have a career where she can work with children, and particularly to help those who experience bullying.

‘If
 I could stand up to bullying, and if another kid who was bullied sees 
me and thinks they can talk to someone and think, "I can stand up for 
myself," then I have helped,’ she said.
