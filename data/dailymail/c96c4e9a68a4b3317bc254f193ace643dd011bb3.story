Laura Johnson, pictured outside Inner London Crown Court, sent a gangster flirtatious messages hours before they embarked on a looting spree during last summer's riots, a court heard yesterday

The daughter of a millionaire was seen ‘laughing and joking’ with three men she claimed forced her to drive a getaway car on a two-hour looting spree, a court heard yesterday.

Laura Johnson, 20, was one of hundreds of teenagers who scurried ‘like wild rats’ around an under-siege retail park on the ‘worst night’ of the London riots.

The grammar school pupil was spotted by a motorist loading a flat-screen TV into the boot of her car amidst the ‘mayhem’ as her accomplices ran back and forth with stolen goods, a jury heard.

University student Johnson, then 19, claims she was so scared of her passengers that she drove them around South-East London as they looted a haul of electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes.

But a jury at Inner London Crown Court has heard that the company director’s daughter had been in a ‘intimate’ relationship with one of the men - a crack cocaine dealing robber called Sylar.

The prosecution has also dismissed Johnson’s claims, saying she ‘knew what she was doing’.

The motorist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court yesterday that he saw the straight-A student three times in the early hours of August 9, driving her distinctive black Smart car.

One of these was at a petrol station, where he said one of her balaclava-wearing passengers waved a foot-long knife at him.

Describing the first time he spotted Johnson, on the Stone Lake retail park in Charlton, he said: ‘There were a couple of hundred people running backwards and forwards to a retail park.

‘They had TVs in their hands and boxes and all sorts. I had never seen anything like it. It was like wild rats running around.’

He said he saw a white woman sat in the car and three black men running backwards and forth to put stolen goods in it.

Watched by Johnson’s parents Robert and Lindsay, who run direct marketing company Avongate, he added: ‘The white female got out of the car within two minutes of me being there and I saw her bring out a flat-screen TV.

'It was unboxed. She went over to Currys and PC World, she was gone for about one minute, then she put the TV in the back of the car.’

The car drove off, but the witness later saw it at two separate petrol stations.

One of these, a Shell Garage, in nearby Eltham, was being used as a ‘meeting point’ for rioters, he said.

The witness added: ‘I saw the same girl I had seen already. A black man was behind her. He held a knife up to me. He had a balaclava on.’

Later on, he spotted the group at another nearby petrol station. ‘The girl was in the front and she was laughing and joking,’ he added.

When Johnson was later arrested at another retail park, police found three LCD televisions, alcohol and cigarettes in her car.

The items were said to have been looted from a Currys store, a Comet and a BP garage.

Earlier
in the trial, the jury was told how Johnson had been treated for 
anxiety and depression at a psychiatric hospital before the riots.

She
later told police that she had been a ‘bit concerned’ by the acts of 
that night, but that she had driven the car as the three men were ‘not 
the sort of people you say no to’.

She
said they had jumped into her car while she ran an errand in Catford, 
South-East London, and had then directed her every move over the next 
few hours.

She later 
told doctors she felt under duress to drive because failure to do so 
would result in ‘violence to her and her family’ and claimed a man known
as T Man had threatened her by holding a thumb to her throat and 
applying pressure.

But 
prosecutor Sandy Canavan said the defendants were ‘swept along as so 
many others were into behaviour that in the cold light of day they can 
hardly believe they voluntarily engaged in, but nevertheless, 
voluntarily engage in they did’.

Johnson,
who has been bailed to her parents’ large detached farmhouse in 
Orpington, Kent, was a high-flying pupil at Newstead Wood School in 
Bromley, Kent.

She is also a former pupil of St Olave’s Grammar School in Orpington, the fourth-best performing state school in the country.

Johnson, of Orpington, Kent, has pleaded not guilty to burglary and handling stolen goods.

A
17-year-old co-defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies
similar charges, but has pleaded guilty to one count of burglary.

Alexander Elliot-Joahill, 18, has pleaded guilty to several charges of burglary and handling stolen goods.

The trial continues.
