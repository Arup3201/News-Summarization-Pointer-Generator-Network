Americans are known for their love of coffee - whether it's pricey single-origin beans brewed with a siphon or the watered-down version sold in Greek cups from the corner deli, coffee is a morning tradition.

But according to a story published yesterday in Ad Age, tea may be catching up to coffee as America's new favorite drink.

Consumer market research by the NPD group shows that the tea industry is experiencing a moment of staggering growth.

Tea time: Sales figures indicate that tea is becoming more popular in the U.S., leading many retailers to invest in expanding tea options

Over the past six years, tea sales have gone up 58 per cent, from $2.4 billion to $3.8 billion wholesale.Growing five per cent in the past year, tea is now the fourth fastest growing beverage category according to Beverage Marketing Corp.

Tea's increasing popularity means it's growing at a faster rate than coffee. While coffee consumption increased 1.9 per cent between 2003 and 2013, tea consumption by the average American increased 22.5 per cent - and it's expected to rise another 3 per cent in the next five years according to IBISWorld.

'The tea industry is going straight up, and at some point, it will reach the level of coffee,' David DeCandia, master tea blender at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, told the Los Angeles Times. 'It's time. People have maxed out on other types of beverage.'

And with domestic tea sales raking in $15.7 billion last year according to Packaged Facts, retailers are quickly catching on.

Specialty retailers like Starbucks and Caribou Coffee, as well as fast food chains, are developing new tea drinks to cash in on the trend.

Starbucks, which has been selling Tazo teas through a deal with Pepsi Co., recently bought tea store Teavana for $620 million. Starbucks plans to grow the chain from 300 stores to 1,000.Â 

'We now intend to do for tea what we have done for coffee,' Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a recent conference call.

To push tea sales more, Starbucks will be offering a new Shaken Peach Green Tea Lemonade this summer, while Teavana will roll-out six different iced tea drinks.

Super size tea: McDonald's is just one of many fast food chains creating a variety of iced teas in response to tea's increased popularity in the U.S.

Following the leader, Caribou Coffee launched a line of sparkling teas and juices last summer, and recently launched a lighter version of it's Green Tea Lemonade this month.

Iced tea is one of the fastest growing types of teas, with 7.7 per cent of tea flavors named 'sweet' in 2012 - up from 3.6 per cent in 2010, according to Technomic's 2012 Beverage Trend Report.

This opens a huge market for fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Sonic, who have all have iced teas they plan on rolling out for the summer.

But while tea may be growing fast, it still has a ways to go if it wants to outpace coffee. According to figures from IBISWorld, tea currently accounts for $987 million in revenue at the wholesale level, which is just a tenth of the $9.6 million coffee industry.
