Outrage: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has unwittingly sparked a rush of cleavage photos on social media

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has unwittingly sparked a rush of cleavage photos on social media after a commentator said it was wrong for her to show too much of her breasts in Parliament.

Outraged women have sent images of their own cleavage to a Facebook page, the organiser telling the commentator that it was time 'everyone accepted that women have breasts and got over it, to the best of their ability.'

The outrage was triggered by columnist Grace Collier who said on a radio programme: 'I don't think it's appropriate for a a Prime Minister to be showing her cleavage in Parliament.'

Within hours women around the country hit back, sending images of their bosoms to the Destroy the Joint Facebook page under the hashtag #convoyofcleavage.

Miss Jenna Price, a spokeswoman for the Destroy the Joint page, said she was building up a compendium of cleavage pictures which might be sent to Miss Collier as 'a humorous way of telling Grace Collier that she's an idiot.'

Miss Price, who is a media academic at Sydney's University of Technology, howled: 'Here's news for Grace: women have breasts.'

The flood of breast photos came in after blogger Jennifer Wilson encouraged women to tweet a picture of their cleavage.

'It seems to me that if we are to stamp out this irrational horror of the female breast…we have little choice but to use immersion therapy in which we expose Ms Collier and fellow sufferers to images of that which they so fear.'

She added that this would result in 'the informed hope that they may become desensitised and return to their normal, hinged lives.'

Miss Collier outraged women when she said on a programme on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Miss Gillard's cleavage was 'not something I want to see.'

 She added: 'In my opinion as an industrial relations consultant, it is inappropriate to be in Parliament, it is disrespectful to yourself and to the Australian community and to the Parliament to present yourself in a manner that is unprofessional.

Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser

'In every Australian workplace we have certain standards of presentation and conducts. It's not just about personal presentation. It's about conduct.'

Sexism is a word that has been hovering around the Australian Prime Minister in recent times.

She has accused Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbot of being a misogynist and only last week she was asked by Perth radio presenter Howard Sattler - who has since been sacked because of his question - whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay as he was a professional hairdresser.

In a  vulgar incident last week 
it 
emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party 
included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail',  
described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'.

Details of the menu at
a fundraising event in Brisbane were revealed after Miss Gillard's 
warning that if her Labour Party lost the general election in September,
the incoming Liberals would be 'dominated by men in blue ties' and 
women would be given only minor roles.

Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also 
targeted in the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist 
trick'
