Night shift employees often need to find creative ways of filling their time.

But workers at a French supermarket have certainly found one of the most creative ways of filling their time while they were meant to be filling shelves.

Arranging pallets and products into a behemoth domino chain, viewers are taken on a tour through the store by way of the domino effect.

Filmed by Eric Bourde, the chain begins outside the Rennes store of Belgian supermarket chain Cora.

A worker pushes the first wooden pallet, at the automatic door entrance of a Burgundy shopping centre - kicking off the impressive domino chain that diverges and meets again after going around a tree.

Up and away: The products ranged in size and shape

As the domino chain reaches the supermarket aisles, the dominos become the products that customers would find in each aisle if they were shopping there. 

From DVDs and CDs to tetra-paks of juice and tissue boxes, nothing is off limits in the massive domino effect of supermarket products.

Everything but the kitchen sink: As the domino chain made it's way through the aisles, the different products available to shoppers were showcased

Eventually, the chain ends at the checkout and a young female employee is seen holding a sign, that translates in English to ‘Thank you for your visit’.

Some viewers of the video have branded it a marketing stunt, but either way - it will no doubt serve as inspiration for bored supermarket workers everywhere.
