George Groves is a force of nature. Carl Froch is a force which defies nature. The weather is set fair for London but the micro-climate about to be generated by 80,000 people inside Wembley Stadium is brewing up a storm.

Froch’s thunderous punches and the lightning fists of Groves threaten to make this a Saturday night as electrifying as it is historic. But which of them will be struck down?

The warrior with the huge heart and unbreakable jaw, or the high-tech strategist with the creative thought process?

Storm brewing: George Groves and Carl Froch are heading into a titanic clash at Wembley

Weigh in: The two boxers salute the crowd after being weighed at Wembly Arena

Not that either of these fighting men is entirely devoid of the other’s prime qualities but it is the broad differences which are dividing opinion so sharply.

The Nottingham Cobra and London’s Saint George each predict one-sided victories by knock-out which will leave no scope for the kind of controversy ignited by the abrupt conclusion to their first, dramatic encounter.

You pay your money – either to be there, to watch on TV or place a bet – and you take your choice. The great British public are split down the middle. The bookmakers have Froch as the marginal favourite but Groves still close to even money.

A majority of the fraternity of the ring appear to favour Froch – with Barry McGuigan, Amir Khan,  Lennox Lewis, Anthony Joshua and legendary American promoter Bob Arum among those telling me that experience will out – but there are plenty of dissenters.

War: The two fought out a brutal encounter in Manchester in the first fight

Controversy: The fight was stopped by referee Howard Foster in the ninth round - perhaps prematurely

What everyone seems to agree upon is that Groves needs to win early or Froch gets him late.

Everyone, that is, except the  combatants themselves. Groves says: ‘I expect to KO Carl with a left hook in the third round but if he survives I will dominate even more the longer it goes.’

Froch says: ‘I will box properly this time and take George out in the middle to late rounds. Unless he actually does come out looking for that third-round win, in which case I stop him early.’

Welcome to confused.com.

What we know for sure is that the 26-year-old Groves gained the nation’s respect with his instant flooring of Froch six months ago and the lead he held on the scorecards before referee Howard Foster jumped hastily between them in the ninth round.

More significantly, he also caught the attention of the world super-middleweight champion.

Froch went into their first fight underestimating Groves to the point of under-preparing and was so irritated by the presumptuous attitude of an opponent 10 years his junior that he fought with  near-suicidal anger instead of a  calculating brain. ‘I’m not making that mistake again,’ he says. ‘I’ve trained back to the physical  condition I achieved in my 20s.’

That has been done by a return to road running instead of cutting corners on the treadmill and with a tough strengthening regime which has included, most eye-catchingly, the repeated battering of a lorry tyre with a heavy metal bar.

Froch has also addressed his  complacency issue by engaging a sports psychologist. He says: ‘I will be fighting with my mind not my emotions. I won’t be charging out again looking for a quick one-shot KO to teach him a lesson — and  getting caught myself.

‘Instead of the worst Carl Froch of my career, George is now facing the best Carl Froch there’s ever been.’

To which Groves says: ‘That’s just not true. He should have lost the first fight and he can’t win this fight. I’m a better boxer than him in every aspect and he just can’t change.’

Fighting talk: Froch and Groves once again went at it during the weigh-in

On the opposite page, McGuigan, who is grooming Carl Frampton as his own heir to greatness in Belfast, advises Froch to make some basic adjustments ‘not least by keeping his left hand up by the side of his head to block those big Groves rights.’ Whether he will pay heed is open to doubt.

Froch knows the risk entailed in keeping that arm low but it has always been one he is prepared to take. Armed with that iron chin he is willing to absorb a big shot so he can keep jabbing and hooking with his left from unusual and unexpected angles, adhering to the ring maxim that it is the punches  opponents do not see coming which are most devastating.

While the late Friday afternoon timing of the weigh-in could create a stamina issue for Groves if he has to toil down to the 12-stone limit — even though he denies he is not a 12-round fighter — the real key to this intriguing contest lies secreted deep in the contrasting personalities of these two men.

Confident: Froch says he will be in better shape and a better frame of mind for the rematch

Both are proud and excited to  be the central characters in a passion play being staged before the  biggest boxing audience in Britain since the war. But while Groves says ‘80,000 or 8,000 is the same  to me,’ Froch declares himself  ‘honoured and humbled by the magnitude of the occasion.’  Groves reports knowledge and experience gained from the original clash, while Froch says: ‘You can’t beat a man like me with bravado.’

Groves, as he prepares to move on to German promoters Sauerland, is setting himself the target of ‘an impressive performance to make the world sit up and take notice. Froch says: ‘I have no real interest in becoming a celebrity. It’s the winning that comes first.’

The scale of interest has been driven by the public’s love affair with these Battles of Britain and such rematches make a lot of money for all concerned.

Better? Groves said he 'expects' to beat Froch in the third round with a left hook

Promoter Eddie Hearn took a gamble booking Wembley for the night after an England match but he has successfully tapped into a popular mood of fascination.

Projected Sky pay-per-view sales of a million may fall just short of Ricky Hatton’s record 1.2m for his Las Vegas fight with Floyd Mayweather but if it is achieved then Froch will bank anything up to £10m, Groves close to £2m.

Being the defending champion has its purse privileges, which Froch has earned the hard way as he goes into his 12th straight world-title fight, all but one against the elite fighters in his division. Although, at coming up to 37, he has no plans for imminent retirement he was asked this week how he would like to be remembered whenever that day comes. Froch replied: ‘As a warrior who feared no man and ducked no-one.’

Time for action: The pair go face to face for real at Wembley stadium on Saturday night

As one who predicted he would stop Groves in the ninth round of the first fight, I expect Froch to be fractionally more patient before his world-class battle-hardening prevails again, in the 10th or 11th.

But whatever the result, that  epitaph of his has already been assured.
