The descent of the David Petraeus case into a media circus has been accelerated by the appearance of Natalie Khawam, Lebanese-born twin sister of Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, at a press conference alongside celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred.

In an apparent bid to gain leverage for her client in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband over their four-year-old son, Allred portrayed Khawam's case as 'extremely important to single moms across the nation'.

Petraeus, who resigned as CIA director after his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell was revealed when Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing emails from her, wrote a letter in support of Khawam's case.

General John Allen, Nato commander in Afghanistan and under investigation for potentially 'inappropriate' emails in a correspondence of up to 30,000 pages, also wrote a letter backing her.

Allred paid tribute to Petraues and his wife Holly at the press conference in the Ritz Carlton in Washington on Tuesday afternoon.

'Both have known Natalie and her son personally for many years, and have had numerous opportunities to observe them together,' she said.

'They have loved Natalie's child and emotionally supported her and her son through the toughest time in Natalie and her son's life.

Speaking out: Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is representing Khawam, a friend of Petraeus and his wife

Business: Khawam was flung into the limelight after her sister contacted the FBI about threatening emails she was receiving from Petraeus' mistress - which led to the discovery of their affair

'They both spoke up through their court declarations in support of Natalie about what a loving, protective mom she was.'

Khawam, 37, who wiped away tears as she stepped forward to speak, declined to answer any questions but spoke of her relationship with her sister.

'My sister Jill and I aren't just twins, we're best friends. Literally inseparable,' she said.

'During my darkest time... she and my brother-in-law, Dr Kelley, took me in with my son when we needed refuge and protection. Jill is the kindest, most generous person I know. 

'We played tennis together. She played net and I served. We also played softball together. She was the catcher and I pitched. We love to cook. I usually bake and she sautees. 

Emotion: At the press conference, Khawam said Petraeus and General John Allen had written letters of support to judges on her behalf as she battled her ex-husband for custody of their child

Sisterly bond: Khawam described her sister, Jill Kelley, as her best friend and loyal supporter

Gloria Allred has a long history of standing up for downtrodden women and of trotting out female clients who claim to have revealing and damaging stories about high-profile men.

The California attorney's clients have included the family of Nicole Brown Simpson in the O.J. Simpson trial and former Spice Girl Mel B for her paternity case against Eddie Murphy.

She has represented two of Tiger Woods' alleged mistresses, Rachel Uchitel and Joslyn James, and worked for Ginger Lee, who claimed Anthony Wiener had encouraged her to lie during his sexting scandal.

More recently, she represented Sharon Bialek, who claimed Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain had groped her - which he denied - and the girlfriend of the former girlfriend of Rudy Eugene, known as the 'Miami Cannibal'.

'We used to study together. I love math, she loves science and she excels in chemistry. We love to play piano and play chess.

'Jill has lovingly supported me through the years and I plan to love and support her unconditionally.'

Khawam lost an ugly child custody dispute with ex-husband Grayson Wolfe despite the letters written on her behalf by Petraeus and  Allen.

The judge said he had serious concerns and reservations over her mental stability and her grasp on reality and accused her of 'outrageous conduct', 'bad faith litigation tactics', and 'illogical thinking' before awarding full custody to the father, who had been unable to see his child for more than a year.

According to the New York Post, Wolfe, 
won sole custody of the boy after the judge found out Khawam, a lawyer, 
repeatedly lied under oath and filed false domestic-violence and 
child-abuse claims against her husband.

She
was also accused of defying court orders to allow her estranged husband
access to their son and sent emails to his friends and colleagues 
telling them he was a 'horrible father and husband'.

Allred
described her client as 'a loving, caring mother' as well as a 'highly 
educated academic scholar and a successful attorney'.

She described Kelley's relationship with Petraeus as 'social'. He has been pictured at garden parties at her $1.3 million Tampa house, alongside Kelley's husband and his own wife, Holly.

Asked by MailOnline whether Khawam had, as reported, visited the White House, Allred said she had been there 'essentially for a tour' but declined to say who had been the host.

Neither Allred nor Khawam would speak about Allen or go into any detail about Petraeus.

On Friday, as news coverage of Kelley
and Broadwell persisted as their roles in the scandal became 
increasingly clear, Allred blasted the media's obsession with the women.

'Inseparable': Khawam, pictured right with Jill Kelley and Senator Marco Rubio, also used the opportunity to laud her 'kind, generous' sister and describe their lives growing up together

Affair: Khawam became part of the scandal surrounding his affair with biographer Paula Broadwell, pictured, when her sister began receiving threatening messages from Broadwell

She told the Daily Caller: '[M]y 
personal feeling on this matter is that women are being depicted in a 
negative and stereotypical manner which appears to be very unfair to all
of them.'

Allred's clients include a string of high-profile women, including former porn star Joslyn James and nightclub promoter Rachel Uchitel, for whom Allred helped win $10 million from Tiger Woods.

She is renowned as the go-to lawyer for women who find themselves caught up in celebrity scandals and has has defended women against stars such as Charlie Sheen, Eddie Murphy, and Rob Lowe.
