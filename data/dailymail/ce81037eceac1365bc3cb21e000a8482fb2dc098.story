An American female tourist has been kidnapped, raped and robbed on a minibus in Rio de Janeiro, it was claimed today.

A male foreign tourist was also held captive and robbed on the minibus according to Rio police.

It comes amid security concerns in the Brazilian city that will host matches in the 2014 World Cup and the Summer Olympics two years later.

Suspects Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza were presented to the press today at the Special Police Unit for Tourism Support (DEAT) after being arrested.

The U.S. Embassy said that one of the two is an American citizen, and a U.S. State Department official on Monday said the woman raped was a U.S. citizen.

CNN reports that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early on Saturday.

Three men then boarded the minibus and forced all the other passengers off, Rio police said.

It is said that the woman was raped, and both of the two passengers' credit cards were used at a number of locations inside and outside of Rio de Janeiro the next few hours, including paying for fuel for the minibus at two petrol stations, police said in a statement.

Brazilian newspapers have reported that the man was handcuffed and beaten, while the woman was repeatedly raped.

After six hours, the pair were then left in Itaborai, a city more than 30 miles away, the O Globo newspaper reports.

They are also looking for a third man in relation to the crime. Multiple calls to the police seeking further detail today have not been returned.

A Brazilian woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects, police said.

The New York Daily News has reported how in an interview with Globo television, commanding officer Alexandre Braga, said: 'The characteristics of both crimes, both the Brazilian case and the one with the foreigners, lead us to believe that they (the suspects) wanted to have a "party of evil".
