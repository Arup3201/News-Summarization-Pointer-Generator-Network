The body of a hot-air balloonist who saved the lives
 of five skydivers before his balloon went down in a thunderstorm was found today in dense woodland.

A search team in a helicopter spotted the balloon before crew on the ground discovered the body of 63-year-old Edward Ristaino.

Mr Ristaino had been taking five 
skydivers into the air during a festival in Fitzgerald, Georgia, when 
stormy weather swiftly moved in.

The balloon was found about seven to eight miles east of Fitzgerald, according to Ben Hill County Sheriff Bobby McLemore.

It was draped over the basket containing Mr Ristaino's body in a heavily wooded area.

A fast-developing thunderstorm sucked in Mr Ristaino's balloon while he was ferrying skydivers on Friday, then sent the craft plummeting toward the ground. The skydivers parachuted to safety and landed without injury.

Authorities had used helicopters, airplanes, horses and all-terrain vehicles to search the woods in south Georgia for the 63-year-old.

Two of the skydivers said he had kept them safe by spotting a field where they could safely parachute and telling them to jump as the storm approached.

Skydiver Dan Eaton said: 'If we would have left a minute later, we would have been sucked into the storm.'

He added that Mr Ristaino's choice to embark on the trip was not reckless. The team took off into a blue sky from the festival. From the air, they could see only a fog-like haze that later turned into a fierce thunderstorm.

Strong winds forced the balloon up to 
about 18,000ft before it collapsed in a downdraft and plummeted to the 
ground at about 2,000ft per minute, police said.

The storm 'came out of nowhere,' said fellow skydiver Jessica Wesnofske.

Mr Ristaino, from Cornelius, North Carolina, managed to direct the balloon over a field and then told the skydivers to jump before it crashed.

The hot-air balloonist, who had 15 years experience and founded the Lake Norman Balloon Co, had no parachute.

Miss Wesnofske's father Brian, 55, was also one of the skydivers who parachuted to safety.

He said that when they launched the balloon at 6pm on Friday the weather was perfect.

Mr Ristaino noticed a haze the distance as the balloon reached about 4,500ft but it was impossible to tell it was a storm until it was too late, Mr Wesnofske said.

Sheriff McLemore said Mr Ristaino was reading off the altitude readings as he fell, in what authorities believe was an attempt to help pinpoint a search effort.

He said: 'Mr Ristaino had just made the statement that "I'm at 2,000ft and I see trees" and that was his last transmission.'

Erin Daly, whose brother was one of the skydivers, called Mr Ristaino a hero who saved five lives.
