Carl Froch has won what may be the most important of all the fights before Saturday night’s Battle of Britain with George Groves at Wembley.

The key battleground, to put it in political parlance, has been the timing of the weigh-in.

This issue has proved even more contentious than the disputes over who should referee Froch-Groves II and which judges should be scoring at ringside.

For Groves, naturally the bigger and heavier man, the earlier the better when it comes to stepping on the scales the day before the fight.

For Froch, the less time his world title challenger has to recover from draining down to the 12 stone super-middleweight limit and then gainingextra poundage, so much the better.

London’s Saint George is understood to have argued for the weigh-in to take place no later than 1 pm on Friday.

Froch is pleased it is being scheduled three hours later for Sky Sports television.

This has been the most private of the many pre-fight disputes.

So much so that it was not even raised during their verbal show-down on Sky’s Gloves Are Off television special which aired at the weekend.

Not even when the confrontation ended with a handshake which turned into momentary arm-wrestling.

Quite what that little skirmish proved only the combatants themselves might tell us.

Froch said only: ‘We can all pull about a bit if you want. Pull and push a little.’

Groves, for the first time, has brought in a physical conditioning coach-cum-dietician following their first fight last November. That ended in him being stopped somewhat prematurely after decking Froch in the first round and being ahead on the score-cards going into the ninth.

London’s Saint George reports himself physically stronge and his upper-body looks more muscular. But the Nottingham Cobra suspects that as a result he may find it more taxing to make the weight.

Froch says: ‘Genetically, George is not a super-middleweight. He is naturally a light-heavy. He always has to take off about eight pounds just before the weigh-in. That’s not good and it’s one reason why he runs out of stamina in the later rounds.’

If he is right, those three hours could be a factor.

It is beyond doubt that Groves will be the significantly heavier of the two by the time they enter the ring at ten minutes to ten on Saturday night.

But the longer his wait to hit the required 168 lb target and the less time to rebalance his body weight, the more that advantage is diminished.

Froch says: ‘I never have a problem with the weight. I walk around between fights only a few pounds over the limit.’

There is no risk of a dehydration problem orany other extra health risks in the weigh-in taking place at 4 pm rather than 1 pm.

It is only in recent years that this process has been brought forward from the morning of fights to the preceding day.

The IBF, the lead sanctioning organisation in this war for their world title and the WBA ‘regular’ belt, stipulate only that the weigh-in must happen at least 24 hours before the first bell.

In the rancorous build up so far, Groves successfully appealed to the IBF for a mandatory re-match amid the controversy which followed their first fight. His demand for non-British officials was also granted, even though Froch condemned that as an insult to the British Boxing Board of Control.

Froch’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, then objected to the appointment of US referee Jack Reiss, saying: ‘He tends to work in the fighters’ faces and jump between them. We have 80,000 ticket buyers coming to Wembley and millions watching no television. They deserve a referee who will let them fight, let it flow.’

Reiss has been replaced by another American, Charlie Fitch.

Then Groves, now his own manager, lodged a complaint against one of three foreign judges,  Leszek Jankowiak, on the grounds that he is Polish and that Froch’s has parental roots in that country, as well relatives still living there.

Groves says; ‘In a fight of this magnitude it is wiser to pay attention to every detail.’

Following that Friday afternoon weight-in, such matters as approval of the gloves to be won and testing of the tension of the ring ropes remain to be agreed.

Come Saturday night, renowned American ring announcer Michael Buffer might consider this slight amendment to the famous phrase with which he galvanises boxing crowds the world over:

‘Let’s get ready to grumble.’
