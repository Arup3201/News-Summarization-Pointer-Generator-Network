Arda Turan obviously wasn’t listening to the half time team talk from Diego Simeone at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday night. 

The Argentine coach, furious that the referee had sent off his captain Gabi in the tunnel, had told his players that the game had finished and instructed them not to push themselves in the second 45 minutes, concentrating instead on conserving energy, playing out time and not conceding.

It was just three minutes into the second half that the Turkish international threw his boot at the linesman escaping punishment presumably because on a night when chaos had reigned since the 47th second when Fernando Torres opened the scoring the referee just didn’t register the seriousness of the offence.

Atletico Madrid's Arda Turan hurls his boot at a linesman  but remarkably only received a yellow card

The Barcelona and Atletico Madrid clash was full of incident, including Turan hurling his boot at the linesman

Simeone was proud of his players efforts and said he told them to show restraint in the second half

Retired referee Rafa Guerrero said on Thursday in his column in Marca: ‘Arda should have been sent off not shown the yellow card’. 

In his defence the player had had his boot knocked off before he launched it at linesman Angel Nevado. 

He hadn’t taken it off on purpose, it wasn’t quite the significant religious act of disrespect that it was likened to post-match with the Internet virals doing the rounds of Arda pelting his branded footwear at George Bush.

The fiery Atletico Madrid midfielder is no stranger to controversy. In the last Balon d’Or voting he didn’t vote for his coach Simeone as manager of the year, although he later claimed this was an error by Fifa.

More than firebrand however his reputation is for flamboyance. Last year he appeared on Turkey’s version of ‘The Voice’. In the Christmas edition of the talent show showing up as a guest contestant singing: Sari Cizmeli Mehmet Aga – a classic Turkist rock song. 

The 29-year-old midfield lapped up the applause and took the criticism of his dubious sining talents well.

The panel of judges on Spanish FA’s disciplinary panel are likely to show far more mercy to the midfielder. 

There is far less retrospective punishment handed out in Spain than in England – the referee’s report tends to be final.

In his report of Wednesday’s night’s game match referee Gil Manzano said that Turan had thrown his boot off the pitch in frustration and made no reference to the fact that it narrowly missed the linesman and also endangered the safety of a Vicente Calderon ball-boy.

Just as Cristiano Ronaldo was only given a two-game ban for his red card, picked up last week against Cordoba for Real Madrid because the referee’s report did not mention him striking Jose Angel Crespo, so Turan will not have his yellow card bumped up to a red.

Neither will Turan be disciplined by his own manager. 

The defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday was one long nightmare for Simeone who had two players sent off and one locked up pre-match when he argued with police and slammed one officer’s hand in his car. The coach wants to move on.

Simeone will be relieved that Turan will not receive a ban and his yellow card will not be upgraded

Fernando Torres opened the scoring at the Vicente Calderon after just 40 seconds on Wednesday night

Arda Turan shaved his head two years ago after winning the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. 

He did in the dressing room immediately after the game and came out in to the mixed zone to show off his new lock to the waiting press. 

‘I promised I would do it so I did,’ he said. Maybe his team-mates will ask him to promise not to throw anymore boots, what they wont ask him to do is ever change his slightly peculiar ways.
