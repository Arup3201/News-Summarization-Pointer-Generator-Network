The statue of Bruni is set to cost £70,000

A plan to erect a life-size and taxpayer-funded bronze statue of French First Lady Carla Bruni in a Paris suburb has caused outrage.

Jacques Martin, the conservative mayor of Nogent-sur-Marne, east of the French capital, has approved the new artwork, which will be inaugurated in May.

The £70,000 statue will not only ‘celebrate’ the looks of the multi-millionaire heiress and former supermodel, but portray her as local factory worker.

By being immortalised in bronze, Ms Bruni will follow in the footsteps of Gallic legends including Joan of Arc and General Charles de Gaulle.

‘It’s an absolute joke,’ said Karim Haddad, a 19-year-old student from Nogent. ‘Carla represents big money privilege – she has nothing in common with ordinary people at all.

‘The only reason the mayor wants this statue put up is to impress the President. It’s pathetic.’

Ms Bruni, who retains her maiden name in her career as a pop singer, became President Nicolas Sarkozy’s third wife following a whirlwind romance in 2008.

The 44-year-old has since built up a reputation as one of France’s most pampered and high-spending first ladies, and is often referred to as ‘Marie Antoinette’, after the spoilt French queen who was eventually guillotined.

Yet Mr Martin, who belongs to Mr Sarkozy’s ruling UMP coalition, believes that an image of the Turin-born heiress will bring a ‘little piece of Italy’ to Nogent.

The commuter town has a large Italian community among its 30,000 residents, and Mr Martin believes that many will be impressed by the six feet plus statue.

It is currently being created in secret by Elisabeth Cibot, an artist who is one of Ms Bruni’s favourite.

Ms Bruni will be depicted in working clothes as a tribute to the ‘plumassieres’ – women who worked local feather factories.

But William Geib, a local Socialist MP, said: ‘It’s sad for the women who have worked in this industry.

Referring to Ms Bruni’s modeling days, Mr Geib added: ‘Carla Bruni must have seen more feathers on ostriches and on catwalks than in factories!’

And Marc Arias, a Nogent councillor, said the fact that the statue was being modelled on Ms Bruni was a ‘a small detail which was specified during the budget vote.’

A spokeswoman for Ms Bruni  said she ‘receives numerous artistic requests’ but did not view herself as ‘Joan of Arc or General de Gaulle.’

She confirmed that Ms Bruni had met Elisabeth Cabot, whose last major work was a giant statue of Pope Jean-Paul II, and authorised her to use her face in the Nogent work.

Ms Bruni is currently at the centre of a charity funding scandal, in which she has been accused of funneling Aids funds to close friends from the music industry in Paris.

Her husband, Mr Sarkozy, is widely expected to lose presidential elections due this April/May, meaning she will no longer be the first lady.
