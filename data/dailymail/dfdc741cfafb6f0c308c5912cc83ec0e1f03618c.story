Nearly three years after Katie Breland was told by doctors that she will never walk again following a devastating car wreck, the determined Louisiana fitness instructor is getting ready to prove everyone wrong by taking her first steps down the aisle on the day of her wedding. 

In October 2011, during a drive toward Franklinton where she worked, Breland missed a stop sign that was turned sideways. A truck hit her Nissan broadside.

She flew through the windshield and across the road, landing in a ditch. Her car landed on top of her. It took an emergency crew 33 minutes to extract her from beneath the engine.

Severe burns covered three-quarters of her body. Two vertebrae were shattered, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down.

Breland was in the hospital for 100 days and had many surgeries, including skin grafts and a surgery where rods and plates were placed to hold her back together.

Speaking to WGNO this week, Breland recalled that when she was airlifted to University Hospital in New Orleans, a doctor came into her room and said that her spinal cord had been severed and she will never walk again.

But the strong, athletic young woman who has spent most of her life playing sports and working out was determined to regain use of her legs.

‘So many people that are in wheelchairs are content with being in wheelchairs because somebody told them the prognosis was that they would always be in a wheelchair. You can’t be content being in it,’ said Breland.

At first, Breland couldn’t hold her head up. She has since competed in her first triathlon. She can drive and walk on her braces and is much more independent.

Breland has been making regular trips to Mike Barwis’ training center in Michigan, where she has been learning different workouts.

When she started her physical therapy she had braces from her chest down. The ones she wears now start just above the knee. And she’s been able to walk about 200 yards in those braces, just holding someone’s hands.

In May, Discovery Channel aired a reality show titled American Muscle about the Michigan center called Barwis Methods. Breland was among those featured in the program.

Last December, Katie Breland got engaged to programmer Odie Hughes, whom she met three months earlier. She is currently planning their September wedding, and wants to walk down the aisle. Practicing for that has been a major focus this summer.

On her wedding day, Katie said she will walk down the aisle flanked by her father and Mike Barwis who helped her power through the pain and go beyond her physical limitations.

Special goal: Katie has been training with her coach for months so she could take her first steps when she walks down the aisle next month

Before her accident, Breland played basketball and had run in hundreds of races, so she knew people were watching to see how she would cope and move forward after the accident.

She knew she had to prove to herself and others that she could still do things she used to do.

That’s how she got started with triathlon training, and she has participated in several races, most recently last month. She races using a specially designed bicycle and hopes to beat her time from last year.

Breland graduated from Ben’s Ford in 2005 then completed the physical therapy program at Pearl River Community College.

For about six years she has worked as a therapist at Therapeutic Concepts in Bogalusa, and she recently opened her own gym, Katie’s Shed.

A personal trainer, Breland holds classes there several evenings each week and also works individually with clients. When she’s not helping someone else train, she’s working out herself.

Breland said she is thankful for the support she’s received from the Bogalusa community, with countless people following her progress and participating in fundraisers and events for her.

She said she knew from the time of her wreck that she wanted to make the best she possibly could of the situation. About a year ago she decided she was ready to share her story, and since that time she has had several speaking engagements each month.

Though there is a constant battle of knowing there are things she is not yet able to do, Breland said the wreck has changed her life in good ways, too.

‘It’s humbled me. It’s made me see things through completely different eyes,’ she said.

She said she saw how quickly things can change and she doesn’t take much for granted anymore, and she values time with friends and family.
