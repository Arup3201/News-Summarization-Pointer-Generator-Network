A leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly their fault.

Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics

The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do.

'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist.

The memo 
surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block--who 
recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 
million times--went viral.

'We
 are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to 
the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote.

Comcast has since confirmed the authenticity of the call and issued an apology.

'We
 are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to 
the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote.

'Why
 is it that you don't want the faster speed? Help me understand why you 
don't want faster Internet?' demands the Comcast rep in one portion of 
the call after Block asks to cancel his service.

Despite
 Block being adamant that he wanted to cancel, the employee told him 
that he had to be given a good reason or he wouldn't do it.

This 'rude, unhelpful and condescending' behavior was 'straight up belligerent' according to a stunned Block.

Only
 eight minutes of the call were recorded because Block's wife was on the
 phone to the rep for the first ten, during which he acted in the same 
way to her.

Interrogated: Ryan Block was confused by the unyielding attitude of a Comcast employee who refused to let him cancel his service with the cable giant unless he gave him a good reason

'I
 started the call by (very nicely) saying that we were moving, and that 
we needed to cancel our service,' Block's wife, Veronica Belmont, wrote 
in the description of the recording on SoundCloud.com.

'He asked if we wanted to move our current service. I said no, thank you, but we’ve already signed up for Astound.'

'The
 representative continued aggressively repeating his questions, despite 
the answers given, to the point where my wife became so visibly upset 
she handed me the phone,' Block wrote in the audio description.

'Overhearing the conversation, I knew this would not be very fun.'

As fellow annoyed consumers across America soon learned, it was not very fun.Despite that, Block would--like Watson--come to the employee's defense, at least in a way.

In a statement to NPR, he too blamed the system that created the customer service rep and not the rep himself.

'Customer
 retention and other CS departments often provide financial incentives 
to representatives to prevent customers from disconnecting (among other 
things),' he told NPR. 'That system effectively pits a representative 
and the customer against one another. Everyone loses — except maybe the 
cable company's bottom line, sometimes, if they 'save' an account.'
