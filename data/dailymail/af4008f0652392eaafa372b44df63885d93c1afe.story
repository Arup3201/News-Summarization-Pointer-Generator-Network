A dog walker got the shock of her life when her pet ran towards her with a fake hand grenade.

Beverley Milner-Simonds was strolling along a beach in Burnham-On-Sea, Somerset, when she threw a ball and her inquisitive puppy, Thatcher, chased off to fetch it.

But seconds later the 39-year-old saw her dog digging in the sand and then coming running back straight at her - with what looked like a wartime hand grenade in its mouth.

Look what I found! Thatcher the dog started running back with what looked like a hand grenade in his mouth

No danger: The dog's owner Beverley Milner-Simonds realised the object was actually a harmless plastic toy

The volunteer coastguard feared for her and her pet’s life - before realising the object was actually a harmless plastic toy.

Mrs Milner-Simonds said: ‘I was walking our puppy when I got the shock of my life. She’d been happily chasing her ball when she got distracted in amongst some debris on the high water mark.

‘Like most coastal areas we have had a lot of rough seas recently and there was quite a mix of flotsam and jetsam.

‘I reached down to pull her away and saw the crack in the side and realised to my relief that it was just a toy. For a split second though, I feared for my life.’

She added that the scare felt even more real because she has previously been called out to deal with real explosives with her role as a volunteer Coastguard Rescue Officer.

Tris Newey, Severn sector manager for HM Coastguard, said: ‘A number of real ordnance devices have been uncovered on beaches around the country in recent weeks following the storms, so I’m relieved that this particular item turned out to be harmless.

‘We would always advise beach users who find suspicious objects to be cautious and dial 999 and ask for the Coastguard.

'We never mind getting called out if there are genuine concerns and people’s safety is at risk.’
