Two young men have filmed themselves repeatedly swearing at a police officer after they were fined for driving without p-plates in Sydney on Saturday

The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before the two men unleashed a torrent of abuse.

'Four times you've been given tickets for not displaying p-plates,' the officer can be heard saying.

The driver hit back: 'What are you trying to prove? You want to know what I think of you. I think you're just a f***ing useless piece of s**t.'

'You're just bored.You're just a redneck that's bored.' 

The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before he tells the driver this is the fourth time he has been pulled over for the same offence

The passenger then chimed in accusing the officer of being 'racist' for pulling them over.

'You are a racist. Mate you done 180kms to catch me without p-plates. You're putting people in danger for a p-plate,' the driver said.

His friend ordered the officer to hand back the license before telling his to 'wake up to yourself'.

'You've done your job, now we're going. We've been waiting for 15 minutes for you to give us a fine for a p-plate,' he said.

The officer was filmed warning the driver not to drive like that again to avoid getting another fine before asking if the pair had any questions.

The driver called the officer a 'f***ing useless piece of s**t' but was allowed to drive away without a fine

'Only question I have is that you need help... like Jenny Craig,' the driver said.

'Give yourself an upper cut.'

The pair were then allowed to leave. 

NSW Police have been contacted for comment.
