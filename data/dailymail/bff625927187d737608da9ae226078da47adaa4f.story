Heartless: Australian, Ryan Jake Lambourn has created a furious reaction from families of those killed in the Sandy Hook massacre by creating a video game in which the player can reenact the shooting and also made a Virginia Tech game in 2007

The Australian man who sparked international fury after he developed a game in which players can reenact the Sandy Hook massacre in which 20 children were slaughtered was also behind a sick Virginia Tech simulation in 2007.

Ryan Jake Lambourn, caused a similar level of disgust when he built the game, V-Tech Rampage, which allowed players to re-create the mass campus shooting carried out by Cho Seung-hui which killed 32 students.

That game caused anger worldwide too, and in an outrageous interview given at the time clearly designed to shock, Lambourn described himself as a 'heartless b*****d', who was 'perfectly content laughing at the (sic) hypocracy of everyone and taking my title as troll of the year'.

In the interview, published on video-game website destructoid.com, a remorseless Lambourn, then aged 21, admitted that he meant the game to be offensive 'so me and my friends and people like me and my friends could have a laugh.'

Showing a shocking lack of awareness towards the feelings of the families who lost loved ones that day in Virginia, Lambourn claimed he enjoyed laughing at those upset at V-Tech Rampage, even appearing proud of that fact.

Defending the appalling timing of the game so soon after the massacre, Lambourn said that he didn't care if the families were not ready to see it, saying that 'i don't see that as my need to wait for them to build up a tolerance to pain.'

Appearing to only want to get a reaction from his interviewer, Lambourn makes the galling claim that his video simulation of a mass murder is in fact art - claiming that attacking people online, or trolling, 'is an art in itself.'

V-Tech Rampage is a controversial amateur action computer game that re-creates the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. The game was created by  Ryan Lambourn

Asked finally if he has anything to say to those who hated his game, Lambourn simply tells them to 'Do a barrel roll'.

This past week, Lambourn has attempted to defend his Sandy Hook game, entitled 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary', to the mother of one of the victims.

Ryan Jake Lambourn, 27, told Donna Soto, whose daughter Victoria, 27, died shielding her students from Adam Lanza's bullets that the game was to highlight the importance of gun control.

Asking Lambourn on Twitter why he had created the game, Donna Soto was gifted withering answers, including one sarcastic reply in which he told her he would 'crib note' the point, which was 'gun control'.

Lambourn's game has caused an eruption of rage from the families of those involved in the massacre, who have said the game has caused them 'deep anger and fury'.

The simulation allows players to re-enact the terrible day of the shooting on December 15 last year where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut.

The game, which has already been taken down by one website where it was posted, allows users to 'shoot mother', collect ammunition and move through the school firing weapons.

Six years after his Virginia Tech game, the Australian posted a justification on his website for the Sandy Hook simulation, claiming that the game is designed to highlight the difference between Australian gun culture and American - which he says has spiraled out of control.

'I grew up in Houston, Texas, where I remember guns and ammunition being available in unmanned sections of Wal-Mart and it being commonplace to hear gunshots in the distance as I tried to go to sleep, which is a stark contrast to Sydney, Australia, where I moved to in 2001,' Lambourn says in an audio message in the credits to the game.

A video game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused pain and outrage among families of victims and survivors

'Australia had sweeping gun control put into place after the 1996 Port Arthur Massacre in which 35 people died, and the result of that sweeping regulation is that guns are no longer a noticeable part of Australian culture. Guns are practically non-existent here.

'Back in America … all these massacres don’t seem to have had any similar effect on regulation. Instead, gun control and enforcement have steadily loosened,' he said in his message.

'And here we are, nearly a year after the Sandy Hook shootings … and absolutely nothing positive has come out of it.'

This explanation has not been sufficient for the families of those who lost their lives in Sandy Hook.

Donna Soto asked Lambourn on Monday, 'how playing a game that recreates how Vicki died would be beneficial? Please tell us,' the family's tweet read.

Lambourn, who claims to be based in Sydney, Australia, replied: 'sure, but you'd learn more by 'playing it.'

'It’s absolutely disgusting that somebody thinks this is funny,' said Donna Soto, whose late daughter, Victoria, 27, was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal for shielding her students from the gunfire during the rampage.

'We’re all suffering. All the families are suffering. We’re coming up on December. My daughter’s birthday just passed. It just adds insult to the suffering that we’re dealing with. It’s just incomprehensible that someone would think this kind of thing is wanted.'

But it is not just the families that Lambourn claims have attacked him.

On his Twitter page, the game designer said that he has faced the fury of almost everyone.

'The liberals don't like me because I've disrespected the dead. The conservatives don't like me because of the gun-control message. The conspiracy theorists don't like me because it risks informing people of what happened. And the trolls don't like me because it wasn't edgy enough,' he wrote on Twitter.

Lambourn also tweeted a screen grab of an email he claims to be from NRA Assistant General Counsel Michael Blaz which demands that he remove a link to the NRA site on the info page of his 'vile' game.

Lambourn responded by saying, 'I regret to inform the NRA, it’s impossible to undo what’s been done,' along with a profane remark.

U.S. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) told the Hartford Courant the game was 'absolutely sickening' and called its creator 'very disturbed.'
