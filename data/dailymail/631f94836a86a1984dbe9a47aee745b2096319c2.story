A burglar suffocated when his neck became trapped under a wooden fence panel as he attempted to flee from a house, an inquest has heard.

Stephen Pope, 35, died from asphyxiation after he became trapped between the panel and a concrete gravel board at a property in Waltham Abbey in Essex, in March this year.

Today, an inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court, ruled that Mr Pope had died accidentally while trying to escape from the garden of the house with stolen items.

Accomplice Albert Brinkley, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 12 months earlier this year after admitting the burglary.

Coroner Eleanor McGann told the hearing: 'It did become obvious early on that this death was part of a burglary.

'We know that somebody has confessed to the burglary, has been convicted and has done his time and come out.

'There is evidence Mr Pope was also part of that burglary.'

The inquest heard how Mr Pope, also from Waltham Abbey, was found holding a pillow case containing stolen items from the nearby property.

A post-mortem revealed that he had been on a cocktail of drugs including cocaine, cannabis and methadone during the break-in.

It went onto state Mr Pope had been ‘pinned in a face down and awkward position that could have caused asphyxiation’.

Floral tributes were also left at the scene with his family saying at the time that he suffered from 'inner demons'

The inquest heard how Mr Pope had told one elderly passer-by, who believed he was a workman, that he was 'okay' when asked if he needed help whilst trapped under the fence panel.

He was later discovered unresponsive by another lady who called 999.

Two female nurses from a nearby nursing home helped lift the fence panel off Mr Pope before paramedics arrived.

But attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and he was declared dead.

Mrs McGann added: 'It is perfectly plausible Mr Pope said he was okay as he did not want to be caught with a pillowcase of stolen items.'

The coroner ruled the cause of death was compression of the neck in association with postural asphyxia.

A secondary factor in the death was noted as mixed drug intoxication.

Investigating officer, DS Darren Ward, told the court the death was treated as ‘not suspicious’ following a full investigation.

He added: 'The investigation did not reveal a third party was involved in Mr Pope’s death.

'No criminal charges were brought in respect of the death.'

Mr Pope had been on bail for theft of fuel when he was found dead outside the property.

His parents Barry Pope, 67, a retired bus driver, and Jean Pope, 70, a retired packer, described their son as ‘a lovable rogue’ outside of the inquest whilst slamming the ‘accidental death’ verdict.

Mother-of-five, Jean, said: 'We strongly believe that this wasn't an accident.

'Stephen had fractured his back in a car accident the year before.

'How would he be able to lift a fence panel with his injuries?

'We’re not excusing what he did but we just want some closure.

'My son was a lovable rogue who wouldn't hurt a soul.

'I knew he had previous for a bit of shoplifting but I’d never known him to break into a house.'

At the time of his death, Mr Pope’s family released a tribute describing him as a ‘troubled and tormented soul’ who was ‘fighting many inner demons’.

The statement said: 'He had the ability to make you laugh and lift your heart, but unfortunately also the ability to break it into a thousand pieces.

'He was a troubled and tormented soul, with some mental health issues and was fighting many inner demons for most of his life.

'This is a devastating tragedy for our family, one from which we will never recover.

'A hole has been ripped in our hearts and that void will never be filled.”

A 51-year-old who also arrested in connection with the incident was released from bail with no further action.
