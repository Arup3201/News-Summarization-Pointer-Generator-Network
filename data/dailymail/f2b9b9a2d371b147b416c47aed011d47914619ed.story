The shocking neglect of drug addict parents whose five-month-old baby boy drowned in the bath while they were 'distracted' has been revealed in a new report.

When father Thomas Egan found his baby son Aaron lying underwater in the tub he merely sat the tot up again and left the room, before the child once again slipped below the waterline.

He was later pronounced dead in hospital, having been taken there from his home in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in July 2010.

Tragedy: Five-month-old Aaron Egan drowned in the bath while his drug addict parents were 'distracted', a new report has revealed

Thomas Egan and the baby's mother Chrystine Templeton were originally charged with culpable homicide in connection with Aaron's death but the case was dropped by prosecutors.

Now a new report compiled by former Central Scotland Police chief constable Andrew Cameron has found that Aaron's death could have been prevented had he been taken into care from birth.

The significant case review, commissioned by East Ayrshire’s child protection committee, found that the death of the baby, referred to as Baby E in the report, could not have been anticipated.

However, it criticises the decision not to place Aaron in care, and lists further failures, including the removal of Aaron from a child protection register.

Mr Cameron also details how there were chances to save the baby, and that 'accommodating Baby E at birth... would have prevented his death in these circumstances'.

The death would also have been prevented 'if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own', the report found.

According to the report, Aaron was in a portable bath in the living room, while Ms Templeton was running a bath for Mr Egan in the bathroom.

Mr Egan had become aware that his son was in distress in the tub, had propped him back up again and left the room. 

'The
 father was fully aware that the mother was not in the living room with 
the baby when he left it. The parents claimed that they had left the 
baby alone in the bath and when they returned he was submerged and 
unconscious,' Mr Cameron wrote, according the The Daily Record.

The report also revealed how a police officer investigating the case said that 'it was clear to him that both parents were distracted'.

'The stark reality is that the death of 
Baby E could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their 
parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own'

East Ayrshire Council

And it revealed how Aaron's parents said they would often use the baby bath's seat to prop Aaron up so he could see the television, which they claimed stopped him from crying.

Mr Cameron made 17 recommendations for 
various agencies, centred on issues such as information sharing, 
leadership and resources.

He also criticised social workers, the police and the NHS for failing to adequately report concerns about the baby's care, and not gaining access to the family home on several occasions. 

Mr Cameron
 said there were 'huge question marks hanging over the decision that was
 taken to discharge the baby into the care of the parents'.

Mr Egan also had a baby daughter who died in a bath accident in Kilmarnock in 1985.

A redacted report by East Ayrshire Council’s chief officers group, responding to the independent findings, notes that the boy was the subject of a multi-agency support plan at the time of his death and that he had previously been on the child protection register.

Prior to his birth, a 'high risk pregnancy referral' had been made to social workers by the midwifery service.

Aaron was transferred to 'special care' when he was born in February that year and discharged home around six weeks later.

Findings: Former Chief Constable of the Central Scotland Police Andrew Cameron, pictured being awarded a CBE by the Queen, wrote in his report that Aaron could have been saved, and should have been taken into care at birth

Officials decided to remove his name from the child protection register on April 26 that year after a case conference heard how the family was engaging well with the various agencies involved.

Outlining the key findings of the review, the council’s report found 'an incredible amount of effort' was made to support the parents and that the baby had been progressing well under their care.

But it adds: 'The independent review officer concluded that the stark reality is that the death of Baby E could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own.'

It continued: 'The independent review officer recognised the complex family history and... concluded that the death of Baby E could have been prevented if he had been accommodated at birth.

'The review findings also noted that such a decision in the case of Baby E was extremely difficult given the range of factors which services had to take into account.'

The review further highlighted 'missed opportunities' when professionals could have shared information more effectively about the parents’ lifestyle, taken action in response to changes in parental circumstances and made immediate decisions about their capacity to continue to care for the child.

In response, East Ayrshire Council pointed to what it said were a range of improvements and developments which have been put in place to keep children safe.

No disciplinary action has been taken against any staff member involved, it confirmed.

Susan Taylor, chair of the child protection committee, said: 'Child protection professionals will always strive to keep children safe, and where possible, families are supported to care for their children at home. In this situation, the multi-agency child protection team put in place a package of measures to help the family care for Baby E.

'The independent review officer recognised that the child protection team tried their level best to support the family, and noted that staff could not have anticipated that this event would happen.

'This significant case review has been carefully considered by the agencies involved and there has been a determined effort to understand and learn important lessons from this incident. We are committed to working together to keep children safe from harm through continuous improvements and developments in practice.'

Victoria Climbie

Abuse victim Victoria, eight, who lived in Haringey, north London, died in February 2000 after being beaten, starved and tortured by her great-aunt Marie Therese Kouao and Kouao's lover Carl Manning, who are now serving life imprisonment for murder.

Victoria was burned with cigarettes, often tied up and hit with bike chains, hammers and wires, and the abuse had been noted by the police,  the social services department of four local authorities, including Haringey council, the NHS, and charity the NSPCC, as well as local churches. However, during the trial following her death a judge described the failure by all to properly investigate the case as 'blinding incompetence'.

A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, also found there were numerous instances where Victoria could have been saved and a subsequent report made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England.

Peter Connelly

Widely known as Baby P, 17-month-old Peter Connelly, died in August 2007, after suffering more than 50 injuries in just eight months, during which he was repeatedly seen by NHS staff and Haringey Children's Services - the same local authority that failed Victoria Climbie.

Prior to his death, Peter had been admitted to hospital with injuries, and on one occasion, just days before his death, injuries to Baby Peter's face and hands were missed by a social worker after the child was deliberately smeared with chocolate to hide them.

Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker, and Barker's brother Jason Owen were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge.

The former director of Haringey children’s services, Sharon Shoesmith, was eventually fired on the orders of the then Children’s Secretary Ed Balls.

Daniel Pelka

Daniel, four, died in March 2012 after a sustained period of ‘appalling cruelty’ during which his mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, of Coventry, starved him, force-fed him salt, tortured him and locked him in a tiny room.

At the time he died he had been tortured for six months and weighed just 1st 9lb, the same as an 18-month-old child.

A review following his death also found that chances to save Daniel, who had gained the attention of social services and police - who visted the home 26 times, had been missed, but did not blame any individual agency.

Coventry City Council has come under 
heavy scrutiny ever since the murder, which shocked the nation after it 
emerged social workers, police and teachers had all failed to save him.
