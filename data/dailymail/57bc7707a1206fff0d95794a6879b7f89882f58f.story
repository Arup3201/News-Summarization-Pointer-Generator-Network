As the the rubble of the Twin Towers smouldered in Manhattan, President George W Bush authorised Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, to hunt down and kill those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. 

By October 2001, U.S. and British servicemen began massing in Afghanistan, transiting through the massive Bagram Airbase in the north east of the country. 

At the height of operations, it had a population of more than 40,000 and was  the air base was the busiest military airport in the world, supporting more than 140,000 operations in a single year - including the Seal Team Six mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. 

A tented city at Bagram Air Base which was once home to almost 40,000 people is being demolished as part of the U.S. withdrawal

Thousands of tonnes of concrete barriers are being removed from the perimeter of the massive facility as it shrinks in size 

At its height, Bagram air base supported more than 140,000 operations a year, including the mission to kill Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden

Troops in Bagram air base put up direction signs marking out their home locations such as Hickham, Holloman and Ramstein air bases

Now, however, the Americans are handing over control of Bagram to Afghan authorities and the size of the facility is being scaled down dramatically.  

Almost 2,500 members of the U.S. military died in Afghanistan over the past 13 years along with more than 450 British forces or MoD civilians. A further 20,000 U.S. troops have been wounded in action. 

President Barack Obama has already announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan for U.S. ground troops, although air support is still being offered. Approximately 10,000 Amercian  ground troops will remain in the country to provide support to the Afghani forces. 

The U.S. withdrawal comes at a crucial time for Afghanistan as the Taliban has increased the intensity of its attacks on local forces.  

In its early days, Bagram Air Base was used to interrogate Taliban of Al Qaeda suspects before they were moved to Guantanamo Bay

The massive airbase used its size as part of its security, with several layers of defence to prevent large-scale insurgent attacks 

Concrete barriers were used inside the air base to create partitions to prevent an artillery strike causing widescale damage 

Local security services face a massive task as they are losing approximately 100 men a week to terror strikes. 

Today alone, at least nine people were killed across Afghanistan, including two children who were struck by a bomb blast while gathering firewood, officials said.

The fatal blast took place in the Zhari district of the southern Kandahar province. A separate bomb blast in the Shahwali Kot district of Kandahar wounded another 10 children, leaving seven in critical condition, said Samim Khopalwaq, the spokesman for Kandahar's governor.

Bismallah Jan, father of one of the wounded children said: 'Our children were there to collect wood to burn when they were hit by this bomb. The government should have cleared the area, it their duty to protect us.'

Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, and children are often killed or wounded while playing, collecting firewood or tending animals.

One of the most effective defences against rocket or mortar attack is the low-tech sandbag which absorbs the explosive force 

The temporary wooden structures are being demolished to reflect the size of the far smaller international security operation in Afghanistan 

U.S. engineers converted 40ft shipping containers into accommodation units, which are now going to be scrapped as part of the withdrawal

The deaths of the two children brought the day's toll across Afghanistan to nine dead.

In the eastern Nangahar province bordering Pakistan, a bomb blast killed Judge Mohammad-ul Hassan and wounded two of his daughters in the provincial capital Jalalabad, police spokesman Hazrat Hussain Mashreqiwal said. The judge served in neighboring Laghman province.

In another attack, insurgents killed six people working on a road project, including the head of a construction company, in northern Baghlan province, police spokesman Jawed Basharat said, adding that the attack wounded another person and left two missing.

In eastern Khost province, three suicide bombers attacked a police academy, with one blowing himself up in a car and the other two shot by police, the provincial governor's office said in a statement. It said three police officers were wounded.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks in Nangarhar and Khost.

Afghan security forces are losing more than 100 men a week to Taliban attacks, which have intensified with the NATO withdrawal

The new shrunken airbase will hold approximately 13,000 U.S. and international troops who will remain for two years to train local forces 

Large areas of Bagram airbase have been heavily mined since the days when it was controlled by the Soviet Union 

Taliban insurgents have stepped up attacks on Afghan soldiers and police in recent months. U.S. and NATO forces concluded their combat mission at the end of last year and Afghan troops took charge from New Year's Day.

U.S. Army Major Eric Lightfoot is serving in eastern Afghanistan where he is training local soldiers how to use heavy artillery, which could give them a crucial advantage over Taliban forces. 

The training mission is due to continue for a further two years, although Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has suggested that the U.S. and NATO could look at 're-examining' their 2016 withdrawal deadline.  

Major Lightfoot spends most days at this dusty base surrounded by mountains in Laghman province planning with Afghan army counterparts how they should use D-30 artillery.

Up until a few months ago, though, the Afghans weren't using the 122-mm long-range weapon as intended - to hit targets several kilometres away, too far to be seen by those firing.

He said: 'They've been using it sort of like a tank, for direct fire at enemies they could see. They're getting better. They are having more successes.'

Major Lightfoot said: 'They are having to get used to standing on their own. Come back in a few months, and we'll see where they are.'

Much of the debris from the scrapped accommodation units has been piled up in central locations for disposal

The airbase is overlooked by the imposing Hindu Kush mountains which are still controlled by the Talban

The number of NATO troops in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan peaked at more than 130,000 in 2011 before a gradual withdrawal began the following year.

According to ISAF, there were around 58,000 troops at the start of 2014 compared with some 13,000 now largely engaged in training.

The United States retains a counter-terrorism force that hunts al Qaeda and other militant targets, along with its unmanned drone strikes and limited close air support for Afghan troops under guidelines issued by President Barack Obama allowing limited combat in 2015.

Mostly, though, the new mission named 'Resolute Support' is tasked with training, including building up systems like logistics, supply chains, planning and strategy for Afghan forces. 

Afghanistan's own security personnel are dying at a rate of about 100 per week, a level the U.S. military has described as unsustainable, and foreign forces are advising them on how to reduce the rising casualty rate.

By comparison, about 3,500 foreign soldiers have died in the Afghan war since 2001, including around 2,200 Americans.
