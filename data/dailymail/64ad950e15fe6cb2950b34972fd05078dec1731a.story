A UKIP activist who called for all immigrants to be sent home is set to fight a key Commons seat for Nigel Farage’s party.

The party is poised to name controversial Lincolnshire councillor Victoria Ayling as its parliamentary candidate for Great Grimsby, which is narrowly held by Labour.

The move comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed how former Tory Mrs Ayling had been caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’

Her former husband has also claimed that she was once a member of the far-Right National Front, but she has denied the allegation.

Last night, Labour said Mrs Ayling’s selection would completely undermine Mr Farage’s boast  last week that ethnic minority  voters would be flocking to support his party.

Labour MP Ronnie Campbell said: ‘Moves like this make a mockery of Nigel Farage trying to appeal to the ethnic minorities.

‘UKIP people say one thing but do another. It’s hypocrisy.’

Last December,  this paper exposed how Mrs Ayling,  described by a party insider as a ‘Farage filly’ for the way she was fast-tracked after defecting from the Tories. She made the inflammatory comments on immigration after leaving the Conservative Party. In a 20-minute video filmed in 2008, she talked about restricting  the number of foreigners coming in  to the country, before saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’

She added: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here.’ At the time, Mrs Ayling, 54, claimed that her remarks had been taken ‘out of context’.

Now she is poised to be named as UKIP’s candidate for the marginal Labour seat of Great Grimsby – which she fought at the 2010 election as a Tory. Four years ago, she came within 714 votes of a shock victory against Labour veteran Austin Mitchell, who is standing down next year. Mrs Ayling was unavailable for comment last night. 

However, earlier this year, she spoke
 openly about her ambitions to become an MP and denied any suggestion of
 racism in her remarks on immigration.

UKIP 
 has been beset by a series of embarrassing claims by party members in 
recent weeks, including one who said comedian Lenny Henry should 
emigrate ‘to a black country’. But last week

Mr Farage used a rally in London with black and Asian party candidates to deny claims  his party harboured racism.

In
 a separate development yesterday, UKIP switched tactics by launching a 
poster campaign to win blue-collar votes from Labour ahead of next 
week’s European elections.

The anti-Brussels party sought to mimic Ed Miliband’s ‘cost of living’ campaign by claiming EU membership put an extra £400 on UK household food bills. The campaign, funded by Eurosceptic millionaire Paul Sykes, came amid UKIP claims that it would now squeeze the ‘soft’ Labour vote in the same way it has attracted former Tory supporters.

A party spokesman said the decision to switch the attack on to Labour was taken by Mr Farage and key aides at a strategy meeting last week. The move was based on research showing that given the party had already ‘eaten deep’ into the Tory vote, traditional Labour supporters represented the ‘biggest, softest’ section of voters left to be squeezed in the final ten days of the European campaign.

Mr Farage said: ‘Despite these being European elections, Labour and Ed Miliband do not want to talk about Europe. They have nothing to say apart from the fact that they won’t trust the people to decide if they wish to be governed from Westminster or from Brussels.’
