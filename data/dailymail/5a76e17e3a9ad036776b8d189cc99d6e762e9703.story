Rapper Kevin Gates has revealed that he found out after three months that his girlfriend was his cousin - but they continued dating for two years anyway.

In a series of Instagram videos, the Louisiana rapper, 28, revealed that he was already having sex with the unidentified woman when his grandmother told him that they were related.

Still, that didn't stop him.

'Everythang beautiful,' he explained. 'And yo grandmama come and tell you one day 'You know, that's your cousin.' Y'all done got the hard part out the way. Why f*** up a good thing?'

No shame: Louisiana rapper Kevin Gates has posted videos on his Instagram, pictured, explaining that he was dating a girl for three months before finding out she was his cousin - but they continued to date anyway

In the video, he explained that they had a good sex life and 'clicked', so he didn't see why he should stop - or why it was anyone's else's business.

Gates told TMZ Live that he started dating the woman in 2006, when he would have been 20, and that they have since broken up but remain good friends.

When asked if they continued having sex after he found out they were related, he said: 'Of course!... We got the hard bit out the way I guess.' 

He added that he would do it again because he didn't believe he had anything to be ashamed about, explaining: 'If you doing something you're ashamed of, you ain't got no business doing it.' 

He never found out whether the woman was his first or second cousin, or more distantly related, but in one of his Instagram posts, he said people would tell them they looked by brother and sister.

'I got a real real big family and it's impossible for me to know every person that I'm related to in my family,' he told TMZ. 'I've never seen this person until that day.' 

Star: Gates, pictured performing in New York City last month, said he does not think he has anything to be ashamed of because he did not grow up with the woman - and they 'clicked'

He added that he probably wouldn't have children with her, though - not because he wouldn't want to but because he's not sure he can have anymore. 

'I just had two and I've been trying to go for three or four and it just ain't been working,' he said, in his clearly characteristic honesty.

Gates, who is from New Orleans, shared his personal experiences with his 1.3 million followers on Instagram after he referenced the relationship in lyrics on his 'Luca Brasi 2' mixtape, he said.

This is not the first controversy for the Louisiana star, who previously spent three years in prison in Louisiana for drug and firearm charges before being released in 2011.

But when he got out, he learned his fan base had grown so he turned to music.

'Rap was more of a release for me, a journal,' he told Billboard in 2013. 'I didn't know I had the following I had. Once I came home from jail, that's when I saw my following and that's when I took it serious.'

His first album, Stranger Than Fiction, sold 8,000 copies its first week. Last year, he released two mixtapes, By Any Means and Luca Brasi 2, which sold nearly 23,000 copies in its first week.
