Flying two-year-old Tiggy Wiggy could attempt to become the first two-year-old to win the Prix De L’Abbaye since Sigy in 1978.

Trainer Richard Hannon is keen for the sizzling six-length winner of Saturday’s Weatherby’s Super Sprint at Newbury to take on older sprinters.

But that looks more likely to happen at Longchamp’s Arc meeting in October than in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York next month.

Breaking clear: Richard Hughes riding Tiggy Wiggy storms ahead at Newbury on Saturday

Champion: Tiggy Wiggy wins the Weatherbys super sprint in the Paddock Day at Newbury

Tiggy Wiggy’s York target now looks like being the Lowther Stakes.

Hannon
 said: ‘She will probably go for the Lowther and then maybe the Abbaye. 
If we are going to pitch her into that sort of stuff it will be better 
at the end of the year. She could get soft ground there which she will 
love.’

Hannon’s Kool 
Kompany (Richard Hughes) was a half-length win of yesterday’s Group Two 
Prix Robert Papin at Maisons-Laffitte from Charlie Hills-trained Strath 
Burn.

A shot at the Group One Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh next month could be next for Kool Kompany.

The
 colt named after the Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany has won 
five of his six races, only tasting defeat the Coventry Stakes at Royal 
Ascot.

John Gosden’s Derby sixth Western Hymn (William Buick) also landed the Group Two Prix Eugene Adam.

Early stages: First Class Mail, who wears the Sportsmail colours, could make his third start this week

Gosden,
 whose Oaks winner Taghrooda is now 7-4 joint favourite alongside 
Telescope for Saturday’s King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, 
could supplement King Edward VII Stakes winner Eagle Top to the Ascot 
race today.

Gosden’s St 
James’s Palace Stakes winner Kingman is not certain to take on Toronado 
in the Sussex Stakes a week on Wednesday – he has the Prix Jacques Le 
Marois as an alternative - but definitely heading to Glorious Goodwood 
is Godolphin’s 2012 St Leger winner Encke.

The colt, trained by Charlie Appleby, will run in the Coutts Glorious Stakes.

It will be his first outing since becoming embroiled in last season’s Mahmoud Al Zarooni Anabolic Steroid scandal.

Appleby
 said: ‘Encke is showing all the right signs but the race will tell us 
whether he holds the same enthusiasm and ability he displayed as a 
three-year-old.’

First Class Mail,
 who carries the colours of the Daily Mail, could have his third career 
start at Newmarket on Friday. The chestnut colt finished fifth at 
Brighton on Thursday on his second run.
