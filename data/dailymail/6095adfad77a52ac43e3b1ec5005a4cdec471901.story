13 years after her father died responding to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Josephine Smith is carrying on his legacy by becoming the first daughter of a 9/11 responder to join the New York Fire Department.

It was an emotional moment for Smith, 34, graduating the FDNY academy Tuesday, full of pride for her family but sadness that 'my father couldn't be here.'

'I've made it a mission to make sure that I fulfilled my dream of becoming a city firefighter and following in my father's footsteps,' she said, crying shortly after the service ended.

Josephine Smith's father Kevin was among the 340 firefighters killed in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center

NBC News that Smith's father Kevin was in one of the units that faced the most danger.

About 340 firefighters died in the attack, which happened when Smith was 21-years-old.

'Kevin was a part of one of the units hit most hard that day: Hazmat 1,' Mayor Bill de Blasio told the graduates. 'Josephine out of that tragedy devoted herself to service.'

The graduation has been a longtime goal for Smith who used to follow her dad to work and play on the fire engines

Mother Angela Clay believed that were Kevin here today he'd be an extremely proud father and would've had words of advice for his girl: 'Do a good job. Keep your head straight. Your heart in it. And love your job.'

Most important, Angela said, 'she's made herself proud about what she's accomplished today. And that's our goal with her.'

The graduation has been a longtime goal for Smith who used to follow her dad to work and play on the fire engines.

She still wears her father's bracelet and carries a memorial card in her hat. 

'There's not a second that goes by I don't think of my father. There's so much that reminds me of him,” she said. 

'Being a firefighter himself, he knows what comes with the job. But he would know it I'd be able to handle it, he knows how strong I am,' she said.
