Samantha Cameron regularly serves breakfast to homeless people in London, her husband David revealed today.

The Prime Minister said his wife volunteers at The Passage, which helps 200 rough sleepers in London every day.

The details of the charity work emerged as Mr Cameron used an interview with ITV's Philip Schofield to encourage people to give their time to good causes this Christmas.

Samantha Cameron was pictured with head chef 'Nour' at The Passage homeless centre in London in March 2010, but David Cameron revealed she regularly goes there to cook breakfast

Mr Schofield met the Prime Minister in the first ever live interview from the Cabinet room in Number 10 as part of his 24-hour TV marathon, raising money for Text Santa.

Mr Cameron congratulated him on his staying power and for raising money for charity.

He said every member of the Cabinet would be training as Dementia Friends as part of a drive to encourage volunteering.

And he revealed what he and his wife Samantha do for charity. The PM said: 'She goes to a homeless charity called The Passage which feeds homeless people in the morning, so she goes off and does that.'

Mrs Cameron was pictured helping at The Passage during the 2010 election campaign, but this is the first time it has emerged that she is still working with the charity. It is understood she attends every few months. 

Four years ago she was pictured chopping carrots, stirring a stew and joking with volunteer chefs at The Passage in Central London.

Mick Clarke, Passage CEO said: 'For many years Samantha has volunteered - like so many other people do - at The Passage. 

'The Passage is all about ending homelessness for those who use our services and we simply could not deliver the diverse services we provide without volunteer support.

'The Passage has a 4:1 volunteer to staff ratio. The Passage has helped many people get back on their feet and end their homelessness, including helping over 2000 people into employment.'

Mr Cameron added that his wife also does 'a bit of mentoring as well, which I've tried to do in the past and I hope to do more of in the future'.

He went on: 'I think one of the best things people can do, if you've got some skills [is] to just try and transfer those skills onto people who haven't had all the opportunities and maybe the education you've had.

'And particularly something politicians are good at, actually, is helping people with whether it's interview skills or CVs or just giving people a bit of confidence and Sam does a bit of that, I've done a bit in the past and hope to do a bit more in the future.'

Mr Cameron encouraged people to get involved in Giving Tuesday - a selfless alternative to the consumerist frenzies of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

'This was something that started in America - I think it was partly a reaction to the crazed internet shopping that takes place before Christmas.

'I think it's a good moment to remember that, of course Christmas is about giving to family and friends, and buying gifts and the rest of it; but it's a moment also to think of others and to encourage giving.'

It is thought to be the first time a live interview has been broadcast from the Cabinet room in Number 10

Schofield has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity during his marathon presenting stint

Today members of the Cabinet are being trained to be dementia friends. The PM said a nurse from St Thomas' Hospital would train the Cabinet because it was important that people were made more aware of the problem of dementia.

'Particularly when loneliness is such an issue, when there are so many people living alone who don't necessarily have families surviving or there to look after them, actually reaching out and helping other people is hugely important,' he said.

'I've already done that, but every member of the Cabinet, by the end of today, will be a trained dementia friend.

'That's really important because it is such a challenge in our country, so many people having Alzheimer's and other conditions. And, as well as the research we need to fund, as well as the improvements in the health service we need, we also need our communities to be more dementia-friendly so that everybody knows how to handle, how to help people with these conditions.'
