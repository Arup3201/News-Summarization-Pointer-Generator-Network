Volunteers are planting thousands of trees as part of Britain's biggest ever man-made forest, in an attempt to replace entire swathes of woodland that were cut down during the First World War.

The 185-acre site, which covers the same area as 105 football pitches, will be planted with 13,500 trees to try and restore the Slindon estate on the West Sussex South Down to its pre-war state.

During the First World War, a large proportion of Northwood was felled for timber by Canadian foresters using prisoners of war to produce essential materials such as coal mine pit props and trench reinforcements.

The Rise of Northwood project is set to see a huge area of the Slindon estate on the West Sussex South Downs return to its pre-First World War state, after much of the forest was cut down by lumberjacks (pictured) to help the war effort

Now hundreds of volunteers have signed up to take part in the 'Rise of Northwood', the National Trust's biggest project to re-plant the site. More than 3,000 trees have already gone in and the group believe they are well on track to finish the woodland by the end of January.

Project leader Hannah Woodhouse said: 'It was heartwarming to see such a great turnout of people giving up their spare time to help us.

'People feel passionately about trees, and many of our volunteer planters and their families have known this landscape for decades, so it has a very special place in their hearts.

'We've still got quite a long way to go, with around 10,000 more saplings to plant, but we're hoping people continue to come forward during our other planting dates in winter and spring.

'This is a wonderful opportunity to be physically involved in the creation of a beautiful landscape that will be part of the English countryside for centuries.'

One volunteer, David Archer, said he had enjoyed the project so much he could not wait to do more.

He said: 'This project is fabulous, and the weekend has been a huge success - it was such a lovely team effort. Personally, I can't wait to do more.'

Apart from the thousands of trees, volunteers will also sew millions of plant seeds from a variety of different species, in a bid to eventually turn the area into natural woodland.
