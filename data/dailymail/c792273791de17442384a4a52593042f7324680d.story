A third of British children are worried about their looks, and 18 per cent have cried because they feel ugly, a new study reveals.

As controversy rages over Olympian Rebecca Adlington negatively comparing her face and body to beauty queen Amy Willerton in jungle TV show I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, the report by parenting site Netmums found a huge 95 per cent of mums believe society 'places too much value on looks over achievements or personality'.

Worryingly, a third of children became 
aware of their looks under FIVE years old - and by the age of eight more
than three quarters of youngsters were acutely aware of their personal 
appearance.

The new study showed girls were much more likely than boys to be unhappy with their appearance. Over half worried about their looks and a quarter had cried over them.

But boys are under increasing pressure to be attractive, with parents saying one in ten sons had cried about not being handsome enough.

Two in five parents also reported their child often compared their appearance to that of others.

However, parents admit they could be driving the problem themselves, with 80 per cent of mums saying they compare their looks to others, and a shocking 39 per cent confessing they have cried over their appearance.

Boys are under increasing pressure to be attractive, according to the survey, with parents saying one in ten sons had cried about not being handsome enough

More than two thirds of mums also admitted feeling low about not being as attractive as others, the poll of 1,107 parents found.

In a bid to combat the issue, 69 per cent of parents regularly tell their children 'it's whatâ€™s inside that counts'. But one in 50 insist on telling their children looks are important, and that 'they must make the most of them'.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'When someone who has achieved as much as Rebecca Adlington feels low simply because of her looks, something is wrong in society.

'While being beautiful is a blessing, there is some evidence children are beginning to feel it is more important than every other attribute - and that simply isn't right. Success and self worth needs to have many forms, not all of them coated in cosmetics.'
