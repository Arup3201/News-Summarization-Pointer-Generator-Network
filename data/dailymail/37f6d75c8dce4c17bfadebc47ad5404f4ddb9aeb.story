Olympic champion Mo Farah struck up a friendship with Hollywood legend Samuel L Jackson when the unlikely duo met at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in London.

The British 5,000m and 10,000m superstar expressed his amazement at meeting the ‘legend’ via Twitter, before Samuel L Jackson himself shared a selfie of the two with his followers.

The star of Pulp Fiction and Snakes on a Plane rated fellow glasses wearer Farah in a post on Twitter with a picture of the pair at the Royal Opera House event. 

'Hanging w/ @Mo_Farah! Bad M******h meets Fast M******h!! Dope Frames,’ Jackson tweeted.

Farah picked up a ‘Team of the Year’ prize in 2012 after his double gold was among the many highlights of Team GB’s London Olympics efforts.

Mo missed out on the list this year though, with Sportsman of the Year award going to Formula One ace Lewis Hamilton, who shared the red carpet with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger

Farah, who won 10,000m gold at the European Championships, has his eyes on another prize and aims to finish his season in style at Sunday's Bupa Great North Run from Newcastle to South Shields.
