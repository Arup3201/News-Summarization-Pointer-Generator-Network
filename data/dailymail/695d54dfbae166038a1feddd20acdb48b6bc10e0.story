This is the moment a tiny French bulldog  raises its paw in a fascist salute when its owner says 'Hail Spain!' and then plays dead when it hears the name of a left-wing politician.

The 13-second video uploaded on YouTube shows a French bulldog, named Benito, raising one of his paws when his owner says 'Arriba España' (Hail Spain!) - a slogan which was used among supporters of fascist General Francisco Franco's Nationalist side in Spain's  Civil War.

The clip then shows the tiny dog rolling over and playing dead when his owner mentions Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Spain's up-and-coming left-wing Podemos party.

Benito has now become something of an online celebrity with the video garnering more than 51,000 hits since it was uploaded yesterday. 

While some  saw the funny side, others were not so impressed, with one YouTube member writing 'An intelligent dog for a fool master'. 

Mr Iglesias has apparently not taken offence and has since expressed his amusement at Benito's antics, tweeting that he laughed aloud when he saw the video.

'They've named him after Mussolini and his owner must be a right fascist, but this dog is great,' said a tweet on the left-wing leader's account, which is followed by 688,000 people. 'I laughed a lot.'

In the video, the dog lifts one of its front legs in a fascist salute and then when he hears 'the pony-tailed one is coming' - a reference to Iglesias's long hair - Benito rolls over and plays dead.

While the Podemos leader has taken the Benito video with a dose of good humour, the rapid rise of the party has coincided with a number of threatening comments posted about the party.

Podemos, which translates as 'We can' was founded by pony-tailed academic Mr Iglesias in January, and was polled as the current most popular political party in Spain in a recent survey.

Podemos has plugged into the discontent many Spanish people have with the big establishment parties, threatening an end to a two-party political system that has dominated Spain since its return to democracy in the 1970s.

Spain's next general election is due late next year.
