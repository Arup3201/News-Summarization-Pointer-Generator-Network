Relatives of a deceased Washington state man were appalled at his funeral on Monday when they opened the casket to say their last goodbyes and discovered another man's body.

Making the troubling find even more heartbreaking, the man who was in the casket had a plastic bag over his head.

The mix-up appears to have happened when Brown Mortuary in Longview - about 80 miles north of Portland, Oregon - took possession of Jerry Moon's body after his death.

Around that same time, the mortuary also took possession of the body of a 97-year-old man who died in hospice care. Somehow, the bodies were mixed up.

'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com.

According to family members, Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket.

'I turned around and said to myself three times, '‘That’s not him, that’s not him, that’s not him,'” son Randy Moon told the station.

Inside the casket was the other man - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin.

Making things even worse, Moon was terrified of being cremated. But because of the mix-up, the funeral home cremated his body thinking it was that of the other man.

Brown Mortuary said were directed by their parent company, Houston-based Service Corporation International, not to comment on the case.

SCI runs roughly 1,400 funeral homes in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 400 cemetaries.

The only other thing I can say is we know where he really is,' Randy Moon said. 'We’re a believing family, and we believe he is in heaven.'
