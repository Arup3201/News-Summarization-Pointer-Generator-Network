By joining the club which spawned Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Gauld ensured one thing. His old nickname was never likely to gain much traction.

‘I’ve managed to escape from the ‘Baby Messi’ tag, which I’m quite glad of,’ said Sporting Lisbon’s £3million summer signing.

‘It was a little bit strange and came about just because I’m small and left-footed. That’s the comparison and it was made only after about four or five games for Dundee United.’

That was all it took for Gauld to become a YouTube sensation. Four games, five at most.

At the age of 11 he was one of the kids who flooded onto the Tannadice pitch at the end of a pre-season friendly with Barcelona. He claimed Lionel Messi’s autograph and hung it on his bedroom wall. Within weeks of being handed a first-team debut for United at the age of 17 his own scrawl became coveted.

Not since Andy Murray dragged his stick thin frame through the early rounds of Wimbledon in 2005 had a young Scotsman been burdened with a level of expectation to match it.

Gauld was fortunate. Wafer thin, modest and unassuming Scottish football’s great white hope – less white than he used to be after a couple of months in Portugal – was brought up in Laurencekirk. He remains well-spoken, grounded and remarkably normal for an 18-year-old almost submerged by the tsunami of speculation and headlines last season.

‘I’m really glad that I’m away from the hype which surrounded me,’ he conceded after signing a raft of autographs and posing for selfies with SFA performance school kids in Glasgow on Wednesday.

‘I’d only played just a few games for United when there were rumours and stories about other clubs being interested. It didn’t really affect me but it was beyond belief it was happening after just a couple of games. 

‘To be over in Portugal now and starting again is really good for me. The main reason I chose to go abroad was the style of football is something I’ve always really liked. I also wanted to learn another language and see how things are done elsewhere.’

No one knows him as Baby Messi in Lisbon. At Sporting they have a tradition of breeding precociously talented young players. A £3m fee was big news here, but less so in the Portuguese capital.

Gauld is part of the club’s Champions League squad, but has yet to play a game for the first team. His early weeks have been spent acclimatising to living abroad, alone, in his own flat.

Satellite television and a wifi connection are all a young man needs to stay connected with home these days but homesickness has been unavoidable at times.

‘It did take me a wee bit of time to settle in, but I really like it now,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘Most of the team can speak English which is good for me. I just try to fill my time learning new things and every day after training I have my Portuguese lessons which helps too.

‘I try and keep myself occupied. To begin with I missed family and friends, but now I’ve been there a few months I’m dealing with it fine. 

‘I knew before I signed that I’d miss everyone but I also knew that I could deal with it long-term.’

For Scots teenagers the horizons rarely spin any further than the white cliffs of Dover. Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal watched him, but his height – or lack of it – put English clubs off.

Physically slight, if durable and resilient to tough challenges, Gauld was also tracked by Real Madrid and Juventus and made up his mind at an early stage to go abroad.

Asked what the biggest cultural shock has been he responded: ‘The intensity of training. That’s been a big difference.

‘In Scotland you get a lot of time off - but in Portugal there are less days off.

‘I do notice that physically I’m a lot sharper and the individual programs have brought me on.

‘The training at United was great - but training at Sporting is a lot more demanding and no-one gets away with not giving 100 per cent every session.’

In a nation where young players fall into the trap of believing their own hype, Gauld knew there were grounds for improvement. Towards the end at United his form dipped. 

‘I knew I wasn’t playing as well as I could,’ he said. ‘I like to set high standards for myself so I tried different ways to address why it just wouldn’t click for me as it had done at the start of the season.

‘But then I realised I’m still young and maybe that’s just something that’s going to happen, a dip in form.

‘I tried to do work in the gym on the physical side of things to try and help me counteract what I was coming up against. I also looked at whether it was a tactical or mental thing.

‘I came to the conclusion that I was getting man-marked more, so that was down to the tactical side learning how to deal with it. There was the physical side as well, so there were a few reasons I found.

‘I’m still addressing some of them. I’m doing a lot of work and as far as international football goes, the physical side is really important. So I still need to improve on that.’

He’s not the finished article yet and admits it. Still, Gordon Strachan asked him along for the double header with Georgia and Poland to form an opinion of just how close he is.

Left-back Andrew Robertson, Gauld’s former Tannadice teammate, is playing first team football in the English Premiership with Hull and looks destined to spend the next 10 years as Scotland’s left-back.

Gauld’s inclusion in either of the two games coming up would be a surprise. Yet, he insisted: ‘If I’m picked I’ll be ready. We’ve prepared the whole week for this.

‘I’ve dreamed about a Scotland call-up for a long time so I feel that I’m ready.

‘At the end of the day you don’t know when a chance like this will come for you again so you have to make the most of it.

‘All the senior players have been brilliant with me this week. Someone like Darren Fletcher has played at the highest level, Scott Brown has played in the Champions League too. It’s great to have players like them around.’

He expected a bit of ribbing. Some ‘baby Messi’ chat has been spared so far.

‘No-one in the Scotland squad has said anything about it yet - which I’m quite glad about,’ Gauld said. ‘I thought something might have been said. There’s been no initiation ceremony yet either. I’ve not had to sing a song or anything like that. I wouldn’t look forward to that.’
