Nadine Dorries made nearly £4,000 for appearing on a TV quiz show for charity - but the good causes she went on there to raise money for received £1,000.

The Tory MP, who was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2012 for appearing on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, took part in the channel's The Chase gameshow.

Bedfordshire MP Ms Dorries appeared on the celebrity episode with darts player Eric Bristow, Emmerdale actress Sammy Winward and comedian Ed Byrne.

But she only managed to answer three out of nine questions correctly and she left with her appearance fee of £3,000 plus £1,000 winnings which she donated to the Bedordhsire and Luton Community Trust so they could support young carers.

Ms Dorries didn't know who sang Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours and she couldn't remember the French word for race track.

She also didn't know Jenny Agutter was in the Railway Children and said Daniel Craig had appeared with a bulldog rather than a corgi at the Olympics opening ceremony. 

A register of member's interests shows she was paid £3,800 for appearing on the show which was screened at 7pm on Saturday, November 30.

The cash was paid to a company called Averbrook which she set up for her outside earnings, reports the Mirror.

For her controversial appearance on I'm a Celebrity, she was paid £6,960 for 12 days in the jungle and also earned £13,268 for TV appearances, interviews and photoshoots in connection with the popular show.

The 56-year-old also picked up £1,440 for an appearance on Have I Got News For You.In
 November, Ms Dorries was ordered to apologise to Parliament for 
refusing to say how much she earned as a contestant on I'm A Celebrity 
Get Me Out Of Here.

Speaking
 today, the MP said she uses money earned for TV appearances to fund her
 personal expenses rather than claim from the taxpayer.

She said: 'I don't claim expenses so I use my outside earnings to subsidise my role as MP.

'I don't claim any expenses, I pay for my travel costs, I don't claim personal expenses. I did win £1,000 for charity on The Chase which went to the Bedford and Luton Community Trust and it was given to young carers in the area.

'Everybody gets lots of questions wrong. Sammie (Winward) did the same thing and she went out with £1,000.'

The maverick backbencher failed to 
inform the Commons authorities about the money she received for eight 
media appearances, including taking part in the ITV reality show a year 
ago.

Despite accusing 
investigators of a 'witch hunt' she told MPs she apologised 'fully and 
unreservedly for what was a genuinely inadvertent breach of the rules'.

She has been censured by the Commons Standards committee, which also complained about her attitude towards the investigation.

The Mid Bedfordshire MP caused a storm in Westminster when she jetted off to Australia without getting permission from Tory party bosses in October last year.

She claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions, discussing important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit.

Ms Dorries insisted the money had been paid to her company, Averbrook Ltd, and did not need to be declared.

She said she had 'no obligation to answer for what payments are made by whom to Averbook' and would only register earnings if Averbook paid her anything.

But the committee said it was 'hard to believe' that she would have been asked to take part in the show if she were not an MP, and as a result the earnings were linked to her role in parliament.
