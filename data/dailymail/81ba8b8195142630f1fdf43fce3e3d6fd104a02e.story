Robbie Fowler has been holding court, discussing the past, the present and the future when Emile Heskey’s name enters the conversation.

Liverpool’s FA Cup tie with Bolton on Saturday evokes memories for Fowler, not least the night 22 years ago when Graeme Souness’ side were dumped out in a replay at Anfield by opponents who were then in the old second division. That was the first time Fowler had been in a Liverpool squad.

He will be in the stands on Saturday when Neil Lennon’s squad come to town but when he looks on to the pitch Fowler will see Heskey – a player with whom he shared a number of big successes at the turn of the century – and not be able to believe his eyes.

‘I didn’t even know (he’d signed for them),’ says Fowler, his eyes wide in amazement. ‘I’ve been in Australia. When did he sign?! I played in a charity game in Singapore with Emile not long ago and, I’ll be honest with you, I’m actually surprised they’ve signed him.

‘I don’t mean that in a bad way. I love Emile. I think he’s a great lad but I think if any of the Bolton scouts had seen him in that game they would have left the contract at home I think! We won but Emile got caught offside about 20 times.

‘Seriously, though, I’m really pleased for him. Obviously, like myself he’s wanted to carry on for as long as he can. Have I retired? You never retire from football. Good luck to Emile. He deserves it, he’s been a fantastic player.’

Lennon has been happy to give Heskey one last chance in the game he adores and that is something Fowler can understand. He has unveiled plans to open an education and football Academy on Merseyside, with the aim of helping young players who have been released by clubs.

Fowler has teamed up with Brian McGorry, who became an education specialist after having a journeyman career in the lower leagues following his release from Liverpool in the 1980s, and the ambition is to get 60 youngsters on a Football and Sports Science course, starting in September.

‘I’ve had a good career and it is a clichéd answer but it is me giving back,’ said Fowler, explaining the idea behind the venture. ‘I’m not in it for medals. It was an idea put together and it sounded good. I know many have tried it but I just thought let’s give it a go again, get involved with Brian.

‘I’m not in it for any accolades, I just hope it works for the kids in Liverpool. I am passionate about it. I’ll be honest, I’m not going to be there every hour God sends. I will be there if and when needed. I will be there as much as I can. I want it to work.

‘This Academy gives kids the chance to get back into the education side. If we are not going to be professional footballers it gives everyone else a start in life, to go to University, get jobs and further education and possibly play football again.

'The stats are there to see. Four per cent go on to play football, but only one per cent have an excellent career. Brian knows more than I will ever know about education so it’s great to have him on board.’

Given the staggering rate Fowler scored goals when he was a schoolboy, there was never any question he would make a living out of the game and he remains one of Liverpool’s most revered former players.

The journey to the top, though, started inauspiciously. It often gets recalled that Fowler was launched on the route to stardom in a League Cup tie away at Fulham in September 1993 but Souness actually had ambitions of playing him much sooner.

He considered Fowler to be progressive enough to name him on the bench as a 16-year-old for a game that Liverpool were expected to breeze through. They had come from two goals behind at the old Burnden Park and it was envisaged the replay would be a formality. It was anything but.

‘At that time Liverpool were going through a massive transitional period,’ Fowler recalls. ‘Maybe it wasn’t a bad thing because it gave everyone a little bit of a chance to see that we needed to change and we saw over the next couple of years that there was a lot of change at Liverpool.

‘I was lucky because I made it. I suppose it’s a case if you want something really bad you can get it, but the same applies in education. There was nothing I thought about but football. This offers an avenue to kids that was not there when I was younger.’
