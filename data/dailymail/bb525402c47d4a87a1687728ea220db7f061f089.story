Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel has been appointed coach of Spanish second division team Real Betis until the end of the season, the club announced on Saturday.

It is the second time Mel has taken over as manager of the side he also played for as a striker, where he netted 50 times in a four year spell from 1989 to 1993.

'Betis have chosen Pepe Mel as trainer of the first team. The coach from Madrid will take charge of the Betis squad ..with the aim of seeking promotion,' Betis said in a statement on their website.

Mel was West Brom boss for four months, leading the club to only three wins in 17 games 

Betis, who were relegated from La Liga last season, lie fourth in the Segunda division, six points behind leaders La Palmas.

The 51-year-old Mel led Betis to promotion into the top flight in 2011 and they qualified for the Europa League at the end of the 2012-13 season. 

Mel was manager at The Hawthorns for only four months, leaving in May 2014.

He guided The Baggies to Premier League safety by three points, but the midlands side won only three in 17 under his guidance.
