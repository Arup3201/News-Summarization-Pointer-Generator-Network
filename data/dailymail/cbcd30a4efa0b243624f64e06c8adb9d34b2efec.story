Five men held on suspicion of raping and murdering two teenage girls who were found hanging from a mango tree in India will not be charged with any offences, investigators said today.

Young cousins, Murti and Pushpa, aged 14 and 15, were found dead in the village of Katra in northern Uttar Pradesh state in May this year.

Their killings provoked national outrage after it emerged that police in the village initially refused to investigate due to the girls' low-caste status.

The girls were reported to have been gang-raped and murdered after going into the fields to relieve themselves because their homes, pictured, like most villages in the district, did not have toilets 

Three brothers, Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh - who are members of the dominant Yadav caste, to which most of the local police belong - were quickly arrested and later admitted attacking and killing the young girls.

Two police officers were also arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims' parents when they reported that the girls were missing. 

But now the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's top investigative agency, has said it would not 'as yet' file charges against the men. 

Announcing the news today, the CBI said there was a lack of evidence to carry out a prosecution.

But a spokesman for the agency - which took on the case after it was initially investigated by state police - did not rule out future charges.

Kanchan Prasad said: 'Based on our investigations so far, we are not going to file the charge-sheet at this stage. However, no one has been given a clean sheet as yet.' 

 

Police and locals had to guard the tree after the girls had been found. The investigation was initially led by state police but was moved to the CBI, India's top investigatory body

Protests took place in the state, demanding the girls' killers be brought to justice

Despite the national outrage, one leading officer said the deaths could have been honour killings by the girls' families. A further investigation found there was no evidence of sexual assault

After they were found, the girls were reported to have been gang-raped and murdered after going into the fields to relieve themselves.

They had gone to the fields because their homes, like most in their village in Badaun district, did not have toilets, their families said. 

A local post-mortem examination also confirmed multiple sexual assaults and death due to hanging. 

But when the case was handed over to the CBI, a forensic investigation into clothing and swabs concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted.

At the time, locals said they were worried they would be targeted for retribution by the police and other high-caste people

India's Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) reported that it found no proof of sexual assault on the girls' clothes.

Even before the CDFD report surfaced, regional police had cast doubt on whether the girls had been sexually assaulted.

The head of police in the UP state instead suggested they could have been victims of so-called 'honour' killings. 

Anand Lal Bannerjee claimed only one of the cousins had been raped and they had in fact been strangled before their bodies were strung up on the tree.

He said: 'According to the postmortem report of the deceased, one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case of honour killing. We are probing the matter.

'We will conduct a lie detection test on all the accused who have been arrested. If needed, we will take the accused to Bangalore for the test and get the results.'  

The men are expected to be released on Friday after 90 days in detention, the maximum time that a person can be held without being charged in India. 

At the time, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he was 'especially appalled' by the alleged rape and murder of the two girls.

Their deaths led to protests in New Delhi and other Indian cities, in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012.
