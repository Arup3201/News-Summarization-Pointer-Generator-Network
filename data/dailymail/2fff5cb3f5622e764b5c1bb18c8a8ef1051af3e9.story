The former girlfriend of a gunman shot dead by police after he went on a shooting rampage along a Hollywood street has described how she woke to 14 text messages informing her of his death.

Alicia Alligood, 24, had broken up with her boyfriend of four-and-a-half years Tyler Brehm, 26, just days before he went on the spree that left one man in critical condition and two injured.

But she was unaware of his involvement in the shooting until she woke at 7 a.m. the following day to 14 text messages - some from the shooter himself.

Happier times: Tyler Brehm and ex-girlfriend Alicia Alligood are believed to have broken up four days before he went on a shooting rampage through Hollywood. The couple had been together for more than four years

Brehm, who neighbours said struggled to get over the December 1 breakup, sent messages minutes before he stood on the Hollywood intersection and shot at passing vehicles.

He had also left Alligood a voicemail hours earlier, telling her he loved her.

But Alligood described her former boyfriend 
as a 'humanitarian', and someone who was 'extremely motivated to change 
the world for the better', even managing a non-profit organisation for a
friend.

Speaking to KTLA, she added he had been 'really stressed out lately'.

He had met a woman he thought was a 
pharmaceutical saleswoman who had given him some kind of pills, Alligood
said.

He began taking the pills, which Alligood found alarming as he had never taken 'hard' drugs before.

After the breakup, he had moved to his own apartment half a mile from the scene of the shooting, she said.

Neighbours said Brehm had been 
struggling to overcome the separation.

‘He wasn't a bad guy, he just got fed up,’ friend Christina Mesropian told KNBC. ‘He was like “Ah, I'm over it, I'm over it,” but I could tell he wasn't over it.’

Ramon Hernandez, who lived in the 
apartment next door to Brehm, said the couple had recently moved out. He
told KABC-TV he had heard them arguing.

Together: The couple had lived together until early December. Alicia Alligood said her former boyfriend had uncharacteristically started taking pills and was 'really stressed out'

‘I could tell that he was an unstable person,’ Hernandez said, ‘but I don't know the details on what actually made him snap.’

Police have not yet announced a motive for the crime, but Alligood said she believed the breakup was the trigger.

Brehm, who was Hispanic and dressed in
a white sweat vest, walked down the middle of Sunset Boulevard on Friday, firing 
on motorists and in the air until he was shot and killed.

Passers-by initially thought he was an actor from a movie being filmed nearby – until he was 
shot dead by a policeman.

Brehm
wounded three people – one critically – before he was killed by an 
off-duty officer working as a security guard on the neighbouring film, 
believed to be a gangster thriller starring Sean Penn.

He was filmed from an office block as he stood in the middle of the road firing on pedestrians and motorists.

Victim: John Atterberry remains in critical condition after being shot through the jaw and neck as he drove to the bank. The top music executive has worked with The Spice Girls, Brandy and Jessica Simpson

Shot: Atterberry, who now works as a film producer according to friends, is seen being taken to hospital

In the video, he can be seen pacing 
back and forth near the busy intersection with Vine Street, firing close
to 20 rounds from what appeared to be a .40 caliber handgun.

One victim has been named as John Atterberry, a 
former music industry executive who has worked with artists like Brandy, The 
Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson.

The 40-year-old driver of a 
Mercedes-Benz, who now works as a film producer, was shot in the jaw and
upper torso on a routine trip to the bank.

He was taken to hospital and remains in critical 
condition.

Witness Micah Williams said he 
thought the suspect was part of a movie. ‘Then the third bullet 
ricocheted right by our head and I was like, “Dude, they’re shooting at 
us,” ’ he said.

Another bystander, Gregory Bojorquez, 
said: ‘At first it seemed like a movie but then I heard the sound of the
bullets hitting metal. It was bizarre, like something from a cop show. 
You get so used to seeing filming in LA that lots of people were 
watching it thinking it was for a film.’

It is thought the gunman ran out of bullets and had pulled a knife from his belt when he was shot by the policeman.

‘He was screaming he was going to die and that he wanted to die,’ Bojorquez, a photographer who captured images of the shooting's aftermath, told the Los Angeles Times.

'He was just kind of shooting spontaneously,' witness William Wiles told The Baltimore Sun Times, recalling what he saw as he watched incident from his bedroom window.

'He didn't really have any mission or purpose or anyone in particular,' Mr Wiles continued.

One man suffered a grazing wound to his left thigh when a bullet passed through his car door. Another man had minor cuts from broken glass after bullet struck the driver door where it met the window.

Another witness, Chris Johns, said: 
'This was like a serious mad man. He snapped and he's going to try to 
kill as many people as possible,' Mr Johns said.

He continued shooting at vehicles and in the air when he was confronted by the officers.

They
ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He was shot when he pointed his
weapon at the officers. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Blasted: The gunman fires into a vehicle before producing a knife after running out of bullets

A truck and another car were struck by bullets, and two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.

Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling's crime drama, Gangster Squad, is being filmed nearby.

It is unknown if the actors were on set during the real-life shooting, but they would have heard the gunfire.

In
the Los Angeles area, every movie production is required to have a 
permit, so if there is shooting,  for a movie, locals are notified for 
any loud noises and big signs are placed on street corners.

The
area was cordoned off and the gunman lay under a white sheet in the 
street hours after the gunfire, leaving traffic tangled on busy 
Hollywood streets, an area is packed with stores and restaurants.
