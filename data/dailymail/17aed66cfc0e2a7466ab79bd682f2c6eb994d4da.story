Two tearaway brothers aged just 12 and 14 are believed to be the youngest siblings in Britain to be slapped with criminal ASBOs after terrorising their neighbourhood for three years.

Thomas Wood, 12, and his older brother Paul, 14, kicked footballs at cars, placed objects in the way of traffic and used verbally abusive language in a number of racially-aggravated incidents.

The brothers caused havoc in Worcester and they have now been barred from playing 'chicken' in the street, making rude hand gestures and spitting in public.

Paul Wood, 14, and his younger brother Thomas, 12, are believed to be the youngest siblings in Britain to be slapped with criminal ASBOs after terrorising their neighbourhood for three years

They have been told to stay away from two sets of shops in the West Midlands city and must not play ball games on two roads in the area for the next two years.

Under the terms of their CRASBOs they have also been prohibited from being verbally abusive and shouting or swearing in a manner that is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress.

The order was granted at Worcester Magistrates Court following an application from West Mercia Police who said their actions 'impacted significantly' on their local community.

A CRASBO is a criminally sought Anti-Social Behaviour Order and if it is breached, the maximum penalty is five years in jail for an adult or a two year Detention and Training Order for juveniles - 12 months of which is custodial.

PC Paul Slaymaker, of Arboretum and Claines safer neighbourhood team, said: 'These CRASBOs indicate West Mercia Police's priority of protecting people from harm and bringing those who cause distress in local communities to justice, regardless of their age.

They were barred from playing 'chicken' in the street, making rude hand gestures and spitting in public as part of the order granted at Worcester Magistrates' Court

'The order means that for the next two years they have to comply with a number of conditions aimed at tackling the issues they have caused.

'If they are found breaching any of the conditions of the order they commit a criminal offence which, if successfully convicted, could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.'

The force said they had taken the unusual step of naming and shaming the boys and releasing their images in order to inform the community of their crimes.

Superintendent Kevin Purcell, policing commander for South Worcestershire, added: 'When releasing photographs of young people I am always mindful of the impact this can have on them.

'There has been the need to balance the volume and scope of their anti-social behaviour with their needs and the need to notify the community of these orders so we can properly enforce them.'

Baby-faced Paul Wood, 14, and his little brother Thomas, 12, were handed the two-year Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (CRASBOs) last Wednesday (14/1).

A court heard the siblings caused havoc in their local community and were involved in a string of anti-social behaviour incidents and racially-aggravated public order offences.

A CRASBO is a criminally sought Anti-Social Behaviour Order which exists to protect the public. 

It is an order made on conviction in criminal proceedings and will have a set of prohibitions unique to the case to prevent anti-social behaviour re-occurring.

This could ban the individual from:

Breaching the terms of a CRASBO is a criminal offence. The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment for an adult or a two year Detention and Training Order for juveniles, 12 months of which is custodial.
