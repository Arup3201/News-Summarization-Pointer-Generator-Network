She opened it, ripped away the packaging and found a number of letters inside. 

After initially saying 'aww' she starts to take them out, but as she does he asks her to spell them as she removes it.

A woman sitting in her living room on Christmas Day opens a present given to her by her boyfriend called Cody. She says 'aww' when she notices they are letters 

As she picks them out one-by-one, her boyfriend urges her not just to look at them but to read them out

At first she looks confused, but then collects them in her hand and starts to read them.

The first word reads 'will' and the second says 'you', and after realizing what it is going to say, she starts to break down in tears.

Her boyfriend then gets down on one knee while she is crying hysterically and proposes.

He doesn't get the answer straight away but as she catches her breath, she says 'yes' before they embrace. 

The adorable video was then posted on YouTube and has received more than 18,000 views.

After realizing that the first words say 'will you', she breaks down in tears and starts crying hysterically, guessing what is coming next 

Still overwhelmed by her boyfriend's proposal, she initially does not respond, but through the tears she says 'yes' and the pair embrace
