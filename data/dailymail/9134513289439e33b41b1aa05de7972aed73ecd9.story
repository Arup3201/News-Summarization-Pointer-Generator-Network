James DeGale will risk his guaranteed world title shot against Carl Froch when he takes on Marco Antonio Periban next month.

The London super middleweight faces the experienced Mexican on the undercard of Nathan Cleverly’s rematch with Tony Bellew in Liverpool on November 22.

Periban lost a majority decision to Sakio Bika for the WBC strap last year but is now without a win in three after drawing with Badou Jack before losing to J’Leon Love last May.

A James DeGale slip up would relinquish his mandatory challenger status to Carl Froch’s IBF crown

Should DeGale slip up, he will relinquish his mandatory challenger status to Froch’s IBF crown.

‘This is like a second final eliminator as if I don’t beat him, I don’t box for a world title,’ said DeGale. ‘It’s a good test, he took Sakio Bika close and he had J’Leon Love all over the place and should have finished him off.

‘He’s not a typical Mexican, he can box on the back foot and he’s going to come to fight and that will bring out the best in me. I am looking forward to it, it’s on a great show so roll on November 22. 

DeGale was last in action in May when he stopped Brandon Gonzales at Wembley in a final eliminator  

DeGale stopped Gonzales in the fourth round to earn shot at four-time world champion Froch 

‘I didn’t want an eight round keep busy fight, I wanted a name that will impress people when I win in style and it will set up a fight with Carl. It’s not about me fighting Carl though, it’s about me getting my shot at the world title and making history becoming the first British gold medallist to win a world title.’

Periban, meanwhile, is determined to ensure it is he who earns a shot at Froch.

‘I appreciate this opportunity and will be putting in a huge effort into training, to win and to put on a great show in the UK,’ he said. ‘I lost a close decision to Bika for the WBC title and I want another shot. When I beat DeGale I hope for a shot at Carl Froch but first I am focused on November 22 and taking him out.’
