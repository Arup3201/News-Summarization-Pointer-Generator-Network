They are photographed by thousands of tourists every year and taken for granted by busy Londoners getting from A to B.

But now the capital’s bridges are getting their own exhibition to celebrate London's most famous river crossing of the all – Tower Bridge.

The iconic opening bridge will celebrate its 120th anniversary this summer and to mark the occasion, the Museum of London Docklands has collected images of London’s bridges to show how they have changed the city over the years.

A mixture of contemporary and historical pictures will go on show to present the structures as design icons as well as the source of inspiration for artists and photographers, past and present.

One of the highlights will be a rare photograph of the Hungerford Bridge, built by one of the UK’s most famous engineers, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The picture was taken by photographic pioneer William Henry Fox Talbot.

From Hungerford to Blackfriars and Westminster to Millennium, the exhibition will also look at how London’s bridges allow people to move around and experience the city.

From Hungerford to Blackfriars and Westminster to Millennium, the exhibition also looks at how London¿s bridges allow people to move around and experience the city. This photograph of the rush hour, taken from the south side of London Bridge was taken by Barry Lewis in 1978

Earth has not anything to show more fair:Dull would he be of soul who could pass byA sight so touching in its majesty:This City now doth like a garment wearThe beauty of the morning: silent, bare,Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the sky,All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.Never did sun more beautifully steepIn his first splendour valley, rock, or hill;Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!The river glideth at his own sweet will:Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;And all that mighty heart is lying still!

Designer of the new London double-decker bus, Thomas Heatherwick’s ambitious ‘Garden Bridge’ proposal, which plays with the ideas of destination and crossing will be on display.

Artwork featuring bridges will feature alongside the photographs and technical drawings.

‘To cross a London bridge is to really see the city. London’s bridges give a view of the capital impossible to appreciate from its jumbled medieval street plan,’ said The Museum of London’s senior curator, Francis Marshall.

‘Most of the time we are in a maze of streets and the city reveals itself in fragments. On a bridge, however, the full iconic panorama is laid out. And no one sums up this idea better than William Wordsworth in his sonnet, Upon Westminster Bridge.’

The museum’s director, Sharon Ament said: ‘London’s bridges are multifaceted in their form and function. They are among the city’s most compelling iconic designs.

‘Tower Bridge’s unmistakable silhouette is an image synonmous with London; just like the Eiffel Tower screams Paris. Yet bridges are also crucial to the way in which people move about the city and offer unique vantage points for seeing – and feeling – the capital.’

The free ‘Bridge’ exhibition will run from 27 June until 2 November at the Museum of London Docklands.

The combined bascule (drawbridge) and suspension bridge that crosses the River Thames was built between 1886 and 1894.

The bridge is 800ftt (244m) in length with two towers each 213ft (65m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200ft (61m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass.

The bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers.

The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower.

It was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife.

Its present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, 
white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it 
was painted a mid greenish-blue colour.

Five companies built the bridge, which cost £1,184,000 at the time, or £114million in today's money.

Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction.

Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance.

The original raising mechanism was steam-powered but was largely replaced in 1974 by a new electro-hydraulic drive system.
