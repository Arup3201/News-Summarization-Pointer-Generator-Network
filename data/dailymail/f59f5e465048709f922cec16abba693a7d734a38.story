New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner has emerged unscathed from a minor car crash on a busy Manhattan highway.

Weiner's spokeswoman says the car he was riding in was involved in a three-car pile up Saturday morning on the FDR Drive, which runs along the borough's east side. According to the fire department the crash happened at about 8:30am.

The spokesman said everyone is in the car was OK, but wouldn't say who Weiner was traveling with at the time.

It wasn't immediately clear where Weiner was headed or if he was on official business.

A Fire Department of New York spokeswoman says no one was hurt in the crash. She says it happened near East 96th Street.

Weiner is seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor. The primary is September 10 and he is currently fourth place in the polls in light of a recent sexting scandal.

Weiner stepped down from his position as a U.S. Representative for New York in 2011 after he accidentally tweeted a naked picture of himself which led to several women coming forward claiming the married man sent them similar pictures online.

His wife Huma Abedin, a former aid for Hillary Clinton, stayed with him after he stepped down from office.

His political career was on the road to being salvaged when he announced earlier this year that he would be running for mayor and was an early favorite to win the race.

But it seems that Weiner didn't give up his digital indiscretions.

More women came forward with evidence that Weiner continued to send lewd pictures to them even after he stepped down from office, including aspiring political blogger Sydney Leathers, 23.

Since then, public support for Weiner has dramatically decreased as fellow politicians, including disgraced former governor Eliot Spitzer, call for him to drop out of the race.
