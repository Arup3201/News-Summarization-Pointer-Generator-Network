The UN has finally condemned Syria for shelling a Turkish border town in an attack that left five civilians dead.

The UN Security Council released a joint statement two days after the assault took place on the border between the two countries.

The delayed response comes as Syrian warplanes and artillery 
continue to pound the cities of Homs, and Aleppo - killing and injuring civilians.

Destruction: Damage from shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city of Aleppo.
The Assad regime's military campaign has shown no let-up despite escalating tensions with Turkey

Survivor: A Syrian civilian, wounded from shelling on a refugee centre by government forces, receives treatment at the Dar al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo. The city has been a focal point of the conflict since mid-July

Victim: A badly injured Syrian civilian is treated for his wounds in Aleppo. Civilians and children have become regular casualties during the ongoing conflict

The reported tank, mortar and airstrikes come alongside a push by government forces on the embattled northern city of Aleppo.

The UN response to the cross border shelling was reportedly delayed after Russia, an ally of Syria, blocked an earlier draft of the statement.

The statement said the attack showed the impact the Syrian crisis was having on peace and stability in the region.

An earlier draft, blocked by Russia, included the phrase 'international peace and security,' the BBC reports.

Ankara's parliament on Thursday 
authorised cross-border military operations following the Syrian attack.

Turkey's planes pounded targets inside Syria for two days in retaliation for the killings.

Although
both Damascus and Ankara moved Thursday to calm tensions, the 
parliament's approval of the cross border operations made it clear that 
Turkey is retaining a military option if threatened.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned Syria in a speech in Istanbul on Friday not to make a ‘fatal mistake’ by testing Turkey’s patience as the Turkish army retaliated for a third day running after more mortar rounds from Syria landed on its soil.

Loss: A man grieves the loss of his relatives killed in the shelling of Aleppo. Forces loyal to the government had promised the 'mother of all battles' to clear the city of rebels

Speaking to a large crowd in the 
Turkish capital, Prime Minister Erdogan warned that although Turkey do 
not want war, they will not be intimidated by Syria.

‘We are not interested in war, but 
we're not far from war either. This nation has come to where it is today
having gone through intercontinental wars,’ Mr Erdogan said in his 
speech.

‘Those who attempt to test Turkey's deterrence, its decisiveness, its capacity, I say here they are making a fatal mistake.’

At least two mortar bombs fired from 
Syria landed in farmland in Turkey's southern Hatay province on Friday, 
one of them around 50 metres into Turkish territory, and a military unit
responded immediately, Hatay Governor Celalettin Lekesiz was quoted as 
saying by the state-run Anatolian news agency.

Turkish broadcaster NTV said Syria 
had given the order for its warplanes and helicopters not to enter an 
area within 10 km (six miles) of the Turkish border and had ordered its 
artillery units not to fire shells in areas close to the border.

There was no confirmation of this from the Syrian authorities.

In the United States, representatives from the White house have expressed support for Turkey’s retaliation against Syria.

‘The United States condemns the 
violence and the aggressive actions of the Syrians,’  a White House 
spokesman told reporters travelling with President Barack Obama to 
Cleveland.

‘The Turks have taken some actions 
that are designed to ensure that their sovereignty is no longer violated
by Syrian aggression and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them as 
they take those actions. They are certainly appropriate.’

The
stepped-up pace of Syrian government attacks on rebel-held areas nevertheless suggests that 
the Damascus regime's forces have not been distracted by escalating 
tensions with Turkey.

Activist
Mohammed Saeed, who is based in the Damascus suburb of Douma, said 
rebels captured an air defense base in the Eastern Ghouta area near the 
capital.

A
video showed dozens of gunmen outside an area where smoke was 
billowing. One of the gunmen says that a 'missile air defense battalion'
was captured. Another video showed missiles inside a room.

Mr Saeed
said the rebels claimed to have captured the base on Monday.

If confirmed, the capture of a stock 
of working anti-aircraft missiles would be a boost to a lightly-armed 
force.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday's attack on Homs is the worst on the city for five months.

The
Observatory, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said
the bombardment had hit the city's Khaldiya neighborhood.

'Around dawn, the regime went crazy and started shelling hysterically,' a Homs-based activist known as Abu Rami said on Friday.

'An average of five rockets a minute are falling.'

Abu Rami was speaking from the central rebel-held old quarter known as Old Homs.

He said the government forces are 
mainly firing rockets and heavy mortars at the rebel-held neighborhoods 
of Old Homs, Khaldiya, Qusour and Jouret el-Shayah.

Abu
Rami also said the Assad regime's forces have been shelling villages 
around Homs and the rebel-held town of Rastan, just north of the city.

The
Observatory also said the Syrian military has been shelling the 
neighborhood of Sakhour in Aleppo as government forces battle rebels in 
the country's largest city.

State-run Syrian TV said that government forces 'cleansed Sakhour of terrorists and mercenaries.'

The transformation of the conflict into an open war has attracted in foreign fighters and extremists, analysts say.

The
uprising against President Assad erupted in March 2011 and gradually morphed into
a bloody civil war which has so far killed around 30,000 people.

Turkey deployed troops along the border with Syria today - with soldiers seen patrolling the area on foot and in armored personnel vehicles.

People
in the border town of Akcakale, where the Syrian shell landed on 
Wednesday, feared more violence in the volatile border area.

Halil Deniz, who lives in Oncul, says
he still fears for his life.

Oncul is a village on the Turkey-Syria 
border where people fled from Akcakale.

'We do not know if we will live or die,' Deniz said.

'Children go to other villages in the evenings, and return back when the next day dawns.'

'Our store owners, our citizens and our children are all very concerned.

'We did not sleep until morning,' said Ahmet Sabritur, who lives in Akcakale.

He
praised Turkey's military response to the Syrian shelling, saying that 
Damascus should be made aware that deaths of Turkish civilians will not 
go unpunished.

'If our government had not retaliated, maybe it could have been worse,' Sabritur said.

'They [the Syrians] could have attacked this town a second time,' he said.
