How far would you go to help a friend in trouble?

Four unsuspecting members of the public were put to the test to see how they would react when asked to cover up a violent crime for a loved one.

Using actors posing as police, hidden cameras, and  rooms wired up with secret microphones, each person was lured to a central London location and told that the friend, who was in on the plot, desperately needed their help.

Four unsuspecting members of the public were put to the test to see how they would react when asked to cover up a crime and hide evidence, including bundles of money, for a close friend

They were each told there had been a violent incident the night before, directed to a 'bloody' shirt, and asked to hide it. This unsuspecting prank victim stuffed the shirt in a bag and hid it behind the sofa

This woman was clearly shocked by the discovery of her friend's incriminating evidence hidden under the sink, but still helped cover up for her loved one

They were each told there had been a  incident the night before, directed to a 'bloody' shirt, and asked to hide it - with all of the four doing so with barely a second thought.

Bundles of cash and incriminating evidence were quickly concealed, or shoved into a bag by the friends, who then either hid them or made to leave the apartment clutching them.

But before they can make their escape, the police knock on the door, asking for the whereabouts of their loved one.

Each lies to say they do not know. 

But while two of the 'accomplices', quietly go with officers to the station for questioning, the other two make a break for the stairwell. 

The fake police give chase - pursuing them out on to the pavement where they are met by those who set them up. 

Each of those who set up their friends told them through a 'desperate phone call' saying they were n serious trouble and needed their help

However, the real test comes when the police knock on the door, asking for the whereabouts of their friend

While each lies to say they don't know - two of the experiment victims make a break for the stairwell when the fake officers tell them they need to be taken in for questioning

The truth is revealed when they are led down the stairwell by police - and greeted by the laughing pranksters who reveal it has been little more than an elaborate experiment.

It comes after recent research revealed that a third of Britons would be willing to do jail time to protect a loved one, with over half admitting they would lie to the police to help their friends. 

The experiment was filmed to mark the new drama series How To Get Away With Murder, which premieres exclusively on the Universal Channel tonight at 10pm.

When it comes to protecting loved ones, people are most likely to break the law for their children (42 per cent), closely followed by their partner (27 per cent) and their parents (13 per cent). 

The research shows that men are more likely than women to protect their spouse, with 32 per cent prepared to break the law for their partner compared to 21 per cent of women.

The experiment used actors posing as police, hidden cameras, and rooms wired up with secret microphones

Emma Kenny, Behavioural Psychologist, says: 'Human beings have an extremely powerful instinct to protect the people they love from threats and dangerous situations; this is particularly prevalent in parents who have a unique maternal or paternal instinct to protect their children.

'We all like to think of ourselves as law abiding citizens but this research shows how more than a quarter of us are breaking the law because we know we can get away with it. 

'In today's society, the lines seem to have become blurred with some Brits seeing petty crimes as completely justifiable.'
