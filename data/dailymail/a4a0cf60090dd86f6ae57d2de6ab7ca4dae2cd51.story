Raheem Sterling became the 13th player to be sent off for England when he was dismissed against Ecuador in Miami.

The Liverpool winger saw red following a clash with Antonio Valencia, who reacted furiously to a wild lunge by the 19-year-old. Valencia also walked for his part in the incident.

Sterling was consoled as he walked down the tunnel by Steven Gerrard - who, as it happens, is one of the other 12 players to be sent off while on England duty.

The first player to see red as an England player was Alan Mullery, in 1968 against Yugoslavia.

Alan Ball was next, in Poland five years later, and then came Trevor Cherry, the only other England man apart from Sterling to be shown a red card in a friendly.

Ray Wilkins was the first England player to be dismissed at a World Cup, against Morocco in 1986 and he compounded the offence by throwing the ball towards the Paraguayan official and hitting him with it.

That was it until the most famous red card in England's international history. In St Etienne in 1998, David Beckham was felled by Diego Simeone and instinctively and petulantly flicked his leg back at the Argentine, who went down rather theatrically.

Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen sent off Beckham, England went out on penalties and effigies of the Manchester United star, who would go on to captain his country with distinction, were burned.

That began a spate of sendings-off (in relative terms) at the end of the 1990s. Beckham's former United team-mate Paul Ince was dismissed against Sweden in 1998 and a year later Paul Scholes saw red against the same opponents and should have seen red earlier in the match for an horrendous challenge on Hakan Mild. David Batty met with the same fate later that year against Poland.

We were two years into the new millennium before the next England player was sent off, Alan Smith for a ludicrous late challenge during a draw with Macedonia.

Three years later Beckham had the dubious honour of being the first England player to be sent off twice for his country when he had to go after picking up two bookings in two second-half minutes against Austria.

Next came another famous case of the World Cup red mist. A barely-fit Wayne Rooney saw his frustration boil over against Portugal and he went after stamping on a sensitive area of Ricardo Carvalho - with a wink from Cristiano Ronaldo to send him on his way.

The next sending-off was nowhere near as crucial, as Rob Green was given his marching orders within the first 15 minutes of a dead rubber in Ukraine, which the home side won 1-0. He did, however, become the first England goalkeeper to be dismissed.

Rooney joined Beckham in the double red card club when he famously and ridiculously kicked out at Montenegro defender Miodrag Dzudovic during a turbulent time in his personal life. The dismissal meant Rooney missed the first two matches of Euro 2012.

And finally, Gerrard was given two yellow cards against Ukraine in 2012.

Now Sterling has become the unlucky 13th - at least he is in some illustrious company.
