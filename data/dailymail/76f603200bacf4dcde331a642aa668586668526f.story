She is renowned for her remarkable strength and endurance.

But the Queen surpassed even her own reputation yesterday, as she arrived in Canberra after a 22-hour flight that would exhaust someone half her age – and went straight to work meeting wellwishers.

The Queen, 85, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 90, smiled broadly and waved as they stepped off the specially chartered British Airways Boeing 777 to cheers from the  waiting crowd as they began their official tour of Australia.

And if there were any republicans among those gathered on the tarmac at the military airfield, they kept a low profile.

Happy: The Queen and Prince Philip arrive in Canberra, Australia, today after a gruelling 22-hour journey from Britain for an 11-day tour of the Commonwealth country

Wave of recognition: The elderly couple made the long-haul trip to open a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Perth next week

The monarch looked genuinely touched 
by the warmth of the welcome – as well as the weather conditions – on 
her 16th visit to the Commonwealth country.

There appeared to be little sign of the cold that forced her to cancel a visit to the British Museum in London last week.

Many royal commentators have predicted
 this will be the last time the Queen is able to make the gruelling 
journey to Australia, but Buckingham Palace aides have rejected that 
suggestion.

‘Her Majesty has more energy than the lot of us put together,’ one said.

Looking remarkably fresh after the 
flight, the Queen was dressed in an aqua Stewart Parvin military coat 
and wore her Wattle brooch, a yellow and white diamond gift from the 
people of Australia presented during her visit in 1954 – the first by a 
reigning monarch.

A deafening 21-gun salute boomed out 
as the Queen took her place on a dais and received a royal salute from 
Australia’s Federation Guard.

After inspecting the troops, she 
received armfuls of flowers from children and wellwishers. One bouquet 
came from Margaret Cunningham, 64, who, as a six-year-old, gave the 
monarch a bunch of flowers on her first visit.

Afterwards Miss Cunningham, a retired 
teacher, said: ‘There was a glint in her eye, she looked at me with 
those same blue eyes from all those years ago, they never change, a 
steady warm gaze, honest and sincere.’

The Queen was also officially greeted 
by Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, who in the past has said the
 country should become a republic after the present monarch’s reign.

But
 yesterday Miss Gillard described it as an honour to welcome her back.

‘Many Australians can recall Her 
Majesty’s previous visits as landmarks in their own lives. Queen 
Elizabeth can expect another warm welcome when she steps out once again 
as Queen of Australia,’ she said.

The royal couple will remain in Canberra for much of their 11-day stay, but will also travel to Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.
