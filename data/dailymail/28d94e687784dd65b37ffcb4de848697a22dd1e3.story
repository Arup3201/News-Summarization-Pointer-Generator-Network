Hedgehog numbers have declined by more than a third in the past decade, research reveals.

The fall is being blamed on their access to food being reduced by a loss of hedgerows, larger field sizes and greater use of garden fencing.

Between 2003 and 2012, surveys by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species found that sightings of hedgehogs in towns and cities across Britain had fallen by 37 per cent.

Worrying: Sightings of hedgehogs in Britain have declined by 37 per cent between 2003 and 2012

The amount of prey available for the mammals to feed on has fallen due 
to the use of pesticides, while in urban areas, tidy, sterile gardens 
has also contributed to their demise.

Experts ALSO believe the decline in numbers is
linked to the loss of permanent grasslands and the 
intensification of agriculture.

‘Over the last 20 years or so, the world’s tiger population is thought to have halved,’ said surveys officer David Wembridge.

‘Although they are very different animals and there are many fewer tigers left in the wild, the fact that we are losing hedgehogs in Britain as quickly should ring alarm bells as loudly.

'We are very concerned. Hedgehogs are quite not fussy feeders, so they should be able to get by even in a bad year.

'So a fall in numbers suggest a bigger problem, particularly with the diversity of creatures in our soil and the health of the land.

'The biggest issue is the loss of habitat, such as hedgerows, and bigger intensively-farmed fields. In urban areas, the use of fences makes many gardens inaccessible, while paving and decking are not good hunting ground.'

In an effort to gather further data about hedgehogs, the trust is appealing for volunteers to take part in the Hedgehog Hibernation Survey which starts on Friday 1 February.

'Continuous monitoring each year is vital to help us build a more complete picture of the state of the UK's wild mammal populations,' said Mr Wembridge.
