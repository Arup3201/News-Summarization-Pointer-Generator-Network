Manchester City have confirmed that they have finally landed Eliaquim Mangala from Porto, with the player adamant he's ready to win trophies immediately.

City's pursuit of Mangala has been the most protracted transfer of the summer and they are believed to have paid £32million to land their man, who has penned a five-year contract. 

The central defender will wear the number 20 shirt at the Etihad Stadium, and also revealed that the arrival of Porto team-mate Fernando at City has helped.

The heart of the Premier League champions' back four has remained an ongoing concern for Manuel Pellegrini who felt he needed a more consistent partner for Vincent Kompany. 

Their problems in the centre of defence were laid bare during the 3-0 Community Shield defeat against Arsenal on Sunday, with Mangala a shrewd capture.  

'City is a top club in Europe,' Mangala said. 'For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this. I am ambitious and this is why I am here.

'I'm very happy to come to England because for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world. It is a very intense and very aggressive competition. There are plenty of goals, so it is also really nice to watch and I can't wait to get started.

'The fact that Fernando is here is better because I played with him at Porto but there is also other players that I know like Sagna, Clichy and Nasri.' 

Landed his man: Manuel Pellegrini identified the centre of defence as a problem area for the champions 

Pellegrini said: 'I'm delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim's quality in the squad ahead of the new season.

'He is already a fine player but in my opinion, he has all of the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe's very best defenders.

'Eliaquim is a player I believe will make an immediate impact in the Premier League, thanks to his physicality, his reading of the game and quality on the ball.

'I think he will prove to be a great signing for us.'
