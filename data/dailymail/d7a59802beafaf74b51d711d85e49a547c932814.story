Anxiety: Stephanie Bottrill, 52, walked out in front of a lorry last year after she was told to 'move house' because of the 'bedroom tax

The brother of a woman who walked out in front of a lorry and killed herself because of 'bedroom tax' has said she wasn't willing to 'give somebody else a chance' in a housing system that requires people to 'take turns'. 

Grandmother Stephanie Bottrill, 52, walked across a motorway on May 4 last year after her local council allegedly told her she had to move out of her three-bedroom terrace house in Solihull, West Midlands, because of the spare room subsidy.

A coroner has today recorded a verdict of suicide  saying the Government's housing policy had caused her 'considerable anxiety and stress'.

But after the inquest, her brother, Kevin Owens - joined by Ms Bottrill’s sister, Josephine Trueman - told reporters she 'wasn’t prepared to give somebody else a chance' of a larger home.

He said: 'For social housing to work it needs for everybody to take a turn.'

'When you’re adequately housed by successive governments, and your needs are met, you must give somebody else a turn.

'It’s terrible that people in this country are cramped into one and two-bedroom flats with children while other people sit on three-bedroom houses.

'Our thoughts go out to the lorry driver whose life has been blighted by this, and we just wanted to pass on our thoughts to him.'

Mr Owens also disputed the claim his sister had made about being given half an hour to 'make a decision' on a house.  

He added: 'Much has been written about "bedroom tax" pushing her - it wasn’t, because prior to that she’d attempted suicide before and that hadn’t been reported before.

'It might have been the catalyst to push her but was it just an excuse she was looking for? - That’s all I’ve got to say.' 

During a hearing at Birmingham Coroners Court today, the Black County coroner, Zafar Siddique, said: 'Given the evidence of notes left of her intention, I am satisfied she intended to take her own life.'

The case of Ms Bottrill, from Solihull, West Midlands, made headlines after son Steven Bottrill, 28, claimed that she had blamed the Government’s housing policy for death in a suicide note.

The former postal worker, who lived alone in the three-bedroom terrace home, had agreed to go and see her GP the day before her death after her concerned daughter-in-law telephoned to make the appointment.

Mr Siddique, summing up the evidence of Dr Bindu Nair, said that when Ms Bottrill attended - accompanied by her daughter Laura Bottrill - she had been 'clear-headed' and given a frank account of a history of anxiety.

'She informed me she had called her children in the early hours of May 3 2013, saying she couldn’t cope with the stress and wanted to end it all,' the GP said, in his statement to the coroner.

Dr Nair added: 'She expressed unhappiness at being pushed by the housing department to make a decision in half an hour, in reference to being made to move into a smaller property.'

He added that Ms Bottrill was 'happy to move but it was the way in which she was forced to make a decision' which had caused her 'considerable anxiety and stress'. 

Medical notes revealed Ms Bottrill had been seeing both a neurologist and her GP since 1993 with 'stress and depression from her life circumstances', her doctor said.

Summarising, Mr Siddique said that in 2005 she took an overdose of anti-depressants over concern about her family.

Then in June 2010, she was prescribed diazepam over a dispute with her neighbour after a fence was removed.

Today’s inquest into Ms Bottrill’s death heard she had the option of a move from the three-bed address where she had lived for 20 years, to another a smaller property in Sheldon in Birmingham.

Both her son and later her daughter had then moved out, leaving her alone.

'She was still coming to terms about whether to move or have to pay extra to stay in her current property,' said her GP, Dr Nair.

He added that 'she felt she wasn’t given the time to make her decision'.

The GP concluded she was 'not clinically depressed' and 'had shown insight into her problems', agreeing to come back to see the doctor a few days later.

However, he was later to learn she had taken her own life. 

Reason: Mr Owens added that 'bedroom tax' may have been the catalyst that pushed her to walk in front of a lorry (not pictured) and questioned whether it was just the 'excuse she was looking for' 

In notes left for family members, summarised by Mr Siddique, Ms Bottrill had made clear her anxieties 'particularly in relation to the house move'.

In one of the notes, addressed to her son Steven, 28, she wrote: 'Don’t blame yourself for me ending my life. The only people to blame are the Government.'

Mr Siddique added: 'She also expressed the fact she did not blame her family and loved them very much but because of the housing changes she felt under considerable anxiety and stress.'

A spokesman for Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council said there was 'never a requirement for Ms Bottrill to move'.

The council said houses were not imposed on people; rather, householders selected from a council list of available properties, made bids on their choices, and in Ms Bottrill’s case she had been successful with two properties.

'The last contact we had with Ms Bottrill was that she wanted to talk about moving,' the spokesman said.

'It was never a situation where she would have been asked to make a decision in half an hour.'

The council said Ms Bottrill had also been eligible for a discretionary housing payment of £3,000, a type of grant aimed at covering the costs of moving home.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'This is a tragic case and our sympathies are with Mrs Bottrill’s family.

'The council was working closely and supporting Mrs Bottrill with the changes. This includes offering advice on extra funding available through discretionary housing payments and giving priority help to move with a number of properties being identified for her.

'There’s often complex reasons as to why people commit suicide and we wouldn’t comment further on this.'
