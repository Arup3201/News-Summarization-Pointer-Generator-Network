Lauren Pope has been showcasing some 
serious style credentials in Marbella, quickly earning herself a 
reputation as quite the TOWIE fashionista.

And now, the reality star is helping fans channel her look by unveiling her first-ever high summer collection for e-tailer Inthestyle.co.uk.

The tropical-inspired range features an eclectic mix of dresses, jumpsuits, skirts and co-ord sets.

New range: Lauren Pope, who is currently filming for TOWIE in Marbella, has unveiled her high summer range for Inthestyle.co.uk (trousers, £29.99)

Speaking about the 26-piece range, the model and DJ told MailOnline: 'It is full of key pieces and items you would see me wearing. I'm really excited for people to see it.' 

The designer, who models the whole range herself, explained that she's added a lot more colour and softer fabrics, as well as sharp tailoring to the collection.

Marbella style: Lauren says that her new 26-piece range is perfect for emulating her Spanish summer style - she's even been spotted wearing a few of the pieces during filming there (jacket, £29.99)

Staying true to her style: Speaking about the 26-piece range, the model and DJ said it's full of key pieces and items you would see her wearing herself (dress, £27.99)

Posing up: Lauren would absolutely 'love' to see Victoria Beckham, Nicole Richie and Blake Lively wearing her designs (maxi dress, £34.99)

Speaking about her inspiration, she said: 'I always look to catwalks for inspiration and to fashion bloggers and some celebrities but once I see something I like, I tend to give it a little twist of my own, we don't want to be a copy of anything else out there.'

Lauren, who cites her favourite designers as Balenciaga, Balmain, Celine and Saint Laurent and loves to shop at Zara, Oasis, River Island and Missguided on the high street, says she finds it hard to describe her personal style.

'It's hard to describe as I tend to chuck different styles together and if I like something I will wear it. I love keeping it chic with an edgy twist,' she said.

Perfect for a festival: Speaking about her inspiration, she said she looked to catwalks and fashion bloggers for ideas (kimono, £26.99)

Lauren, who is currently coveting tailoring, crop tops and midi skirts, says her beauty icons are 'effortlessly cool' Nicole Richie and Blake Lively, who 'always get it right and never look try hard'.

As for fashion, she is inspired by bloggers such as Peace Loves Shea and The Blonde Salad, rather than celebrities.

However, she would absolutely 'love' to see Victoria Beckham, Nicole Richie and Blake Lively wearing her designs, which are priced from £16.99.

Something for everyone: The tropical-inspired collection features an eclectic mix of dresses, jumpsuits, skirts and co-ord sets (skirt, £19.99)

Speaking about her future plans and budding empire, she said: 'We start filming again soon, kicking off in Marbella and I have a big music-based project I'm working on that will be launched around the same time, which is really exciting.

In five years time, I will hopefully be married with a lovely family and happy with whatever I'm doing. I would love to stay in the fashion and beauty industry and build my Hair Rehab London brand up even more and, of course, work on more clothing collections.'
