The wife of outspoken Labour MP Austin Mitchell has defended her husband against claims that his Twitter outburst at a Tory MP proves he is a sexist.

Mr Mitchell, who has been an MP since 1977, admonished chick-lit author and politician Louise Mensch for contradicting her husband about why she was quitting parliament.

The left-winger MP tweeted: ‘Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics.’

Austin Mitchell's wife Linda McDougall said she was standing by her man after he took to Twitter to tell Louise Mensch to 'shut up'

Mr Mitchell’s remarks provoked fury and calls for the MP to be expelled from the party.

Critics – including his wife, the journalist Linda McDougall who describes herself as a hardline feminist - called for Mr Mitchell to withdraw the tweet.

But Mr Mitchell’s wife insisted her husband is not a ‘dinosaur’.

She told the Daily Mail that she blamed herself as she had alerted her husband to the article about Mrs Mensch after she ‘dispatched him to fetch the Sunday papers’.

Ms McDougall said: ‘We were sitting across from each other on the train and before I knew it he was tweeting it on his I-phone.’

The broadcaster and filmmaker also revealed that she knew Mrs Mensch after  ‘I employed her to do a film’ about some political awards.

She added: ‘She was very nice and I really liked her. This has not changed my opinion of her. Austin has long been a great admirer of hers.’

She added that while she did not approve of the tweet, she was standing by her man: ‘I am the Tammy Wynette of Grimbsy. Austin is the kindest and hardest working man.

‘I wouldn’t describe him as a feminist as he likes his jokes but I am proud of him. No one would stand up more for the hard-pressed women of Grimsby than Austin.’

Ms Mensch was forced to deny allegations made by her husband Peter in a newspaper interview that she quit her role as an MP because she didn't think she would win at the next election

Ms McDougall – who said she had been a feminist since she ‘emerged from the womb 71 years ago’ - said she was upset at the Twitter abuse aimed at her husband. ‘About 80 per cent of the Tweets have been ageist. It may be terribly upsetting for Louise Mensch but it’s OK for us elderly.’

Despite the criticism from all sides, Mr Mitchell, issued an even more inflammatory tweet yesterday.

He said on the social networking site: ‘Calm down dears. Irony may be a low form of wit but it's clearly above my level. And yours. So my wife has banned me from tweeting today.’

He added: ‘Wife,three daughters,one granddaughter and Labour press office all demand that I withdraw my tweet. No chance of front bench now.’

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Austin Mitchell has made clear the tweet was a joke, not a serious comment. It’s not funny, it’s understandable that people find it offensive, and it is not the view of the Labour Party.’

Mrs Mensch also called on Ed Miliband to ‘repudiate’ Mr Mitchell, pointing out Tory MP Aidan Burley’s twitter tirade at the Olympics Opening Ceremony as ‘leftie, mult-cultural clap trap’ had been called ‘idiotic’ by David Cameron.

Mrs Mensch also took a swipe at deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman took to Twitter to say: ‘H Harman's silence speaks volumes. Don't talk to me about standing for women.’

But Tory MP Nadine Dorries took a swipe at her former colleague, accusing Mrs Mensch of ‘deserting her post’.

Ms Dorries said: ‘It’s disappointing that Louise did not do what every other MP has to do. The decent thing to do would have been to stick in there and battle to the end.’

The controversy started when Peter Mensch told a Sunday newspaper that his wife was quitting British politics because of ‘Louise’s belief that she was only going to be an MP for three more years.’

He said: ‘She thought, and I wasn't going to argue with her, that she'd get killed at the next election. So, to her, it seemed much more short-term than my job as a manager, which is going to go on for another 20 years.

‘And listen, they hadn't promoted her yet, and it's not like she thought she had a future because perhaps she felt she was too outspoken. She was doing her own thing regardless and maybe wasn't

'Conservative party enough' to move up the food chain.’

Mrs Mensch, who is taking a job as a newspaper columnist in New York, took to Twitter to explain her side: ‘Can honestly say I had no fear whatsoever of defeat at next election since had already decided not to stand again,’ she tweeted.

‘However: nothing, repeat nothing, influenced decision to resign other than inability to hold family life together away from him.’

The seat of Corby is set for a byelection on 15 November 15. Senior Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has commissioned polling which shows the Tories are on course to lose to Labour.
