Britons staying in areas of the Kenyan coast have been warned to leave unless they have an essential reason to remain.

The Foreign Office alert comes after a spate of attacks by militant Islamist group Al Shabaab which have left at least 87 dead.

Last week 22 people were killed in raids in the village of Hindi in Lamu county and the Gamba area of Tana River county, the Kenya Red Cross said.

Warning for tourists: Last week 22 people were killed in raids in the village of Hindi in Lamu county and the Gamba area of Tana River county

And last month an attack by gunmen in the coastal town of Mpeketoni left 65 dead.

The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to Lamu county and parts of Tana River county north of the Tana river itself.

Its advice adds: ‘If you are currently in an area to which we now advise against all but essential travel you should consider whether you have an essential reason to remain. If not, you should leave the area.’

In May ten people were killed when two explosions hit the capital Nairobi. It prompted tour operators Thomson and First Choice to cancel all flights to Kenya until October 31.

In May, hundreds of tourists were evacuated from the coastal region fearing further terror attacks
