Former Labour minister Alan Milburn said young people were being left behind in the recovery

The next generation will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment, the Government's social mobility Tsar has claimed.

Former Labour minster Alan Milburn said the recession had condemned those in their twenties to 'the wrong side of the divide' between those with good jobs and their own homes and those stranded on low pay.

He revealed wages for the under 30s had fallen by 10 per cent since the recession pricing people out of buying their own home. Wages for those in their twenties are back to where they were in 1998 – 16 years ago.

Half a millions young Britons were still out of work six years after the recession hit, Mr Milburn added.

He said the jobs crisis had even put an end to the traditional Saturday job for students. The proportion of 16 to 17-year-olds in full-time education who also work has fallen from 37 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade.

Mr Milburn told The Observer: 'It is depressing. The current generation of young people are educated better and for longer than any previous one. But young people are losing out on jobs, earnings and housing.

'This recession has been particularly hard on young people. The ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates was just over two to one in 1996, compared to just under three to one today.

'On any definition we are nowhere near the chancellor's objective of 'full employment' for young people. Young people are the losers in the recovery to date.'

The average pay of a 22-to-29-year-old is now £9.73 an hour, 10 per cent lower than it was in 2006. Eighteen to 21-year-olds meanwhile are on just £6.73, is 8.8 per cent lower than six years ago.

Both are at the same wage level as they were in 1998.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that those aged between 22 and 30 are now earning 15 per cent less than before the recession.

The proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds in work has fallen from 65 per cent at the start of 2007 to 60.8 per cent today.

Chancellor George Osborne is failing to achieve his goal of full youth employment, the Government's social mobility advisor Alan Milburn said

Despite recent falls in unemployment, the real value of people's stagnant wages are being eroded by inflation

The Government claims its 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year

Mr Milburn said: 'Youth unemployment is still higher than before the recession and by the time of the next election around half a million young people will still be without work, enough to fill Wembley stadium five times over.

'Urgent action is needed to prevent this generation of young people faring worse than their parents' generation.

'Social mobility relies on young people having better opportunities to progress. Investment in the skills and employment of young people today is money saved in social security and the costs of poverty tomorrow.'
