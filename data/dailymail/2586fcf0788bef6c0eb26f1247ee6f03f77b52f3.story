Fearful: After the bombings, Tsarnaev's mom says he laughed off her concerns, but later called to say he and his brother were being chased by police

Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev took time during his final moments to phone his mother as he engaged in a furious gun battle with police early on Friday morning, it has emerged.

'The police, they have started shooting at us, they are chasing us,' Tsarnaev told his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva.

At the time he was hurling pressure cooker bombs at officers in the suburb of Watertown as he and his brothers fired more than 200 rounds.

Then, finally, before hanging up Tsarnaev said: 'Mama, I love you.'

When he ran out of bullets, police say he charged at police, before officers tackeld him and he was finally run over by his brother Dzhokar.

Days earlier, reports The Wall Street Journal, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva had called her son after the bombings, concerned about his safety.

Shockingly, he'd merely shrugged off her concern.

'Mama,' laughed Tsarnaeva, 'why are you worrying?'

This was not, however, the first time the young man dealt in troubling telephone calls.

Zubeidat
 and her husband Anzor Tsarnaev have claimed that their oldest son 
received a call from the FBI accusing him of the attack, to which he 
responded: 'That's your problem.'

Tamerlan Tsarnaeva,
 who was killed following a shoot out with the police on April 19, 
called his mother two or three days after the marathon bombings to tell 
her about the call from the FBI, his father said.

Family: Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev have also said their son claimed the FBI called him to accuse him of the bombings

The claims, reported by Channel 4 News, reveal how Tsarnaeva,
 26, believed that the FBI was watching him. His mother previously said 
he had been followed by the FBI for five years.

Channel 4 News suggested that, while it was unlikely the FBI had called the suspect to accuse him of the heinous crime, it was perhaps his way of preparing his parents for the news of his involvement.

While it seems unlikely, if the claim is true, it raises questions over how the FBI handled the case.

The agency has already come under fire for reportedly failing to stop the brothers before they planted two bombs at the finish line of the marathon.

It has emerged that Russian authorities alerted the FBI about their concerns over Tsarnaeva's links after he was spotted speaking to an Islamic militant six times at a mosque in Dagestan last year.

Hiding out: Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of the bombers, said his son claimed the FBI were on to him

Now his parents are planning to visit the U.S. to see their surviving son, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a boat following his older brother's death.

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told ABC World News in a tearful phone interview that she fears her son will receive the death penalty.

‘I lost two sons,’ she said through tears over the phone. ‘My family is in the dirt.’

The grieving mother did not say when she and her husband, Anzor Tsarnaev, plan to travel to the U.S.

She
 told an ABC reporter based in southern Russia that she fears she will 
be unable to do so, despite her having an American passport, because she
 is now the parent of a suspected terrorist.

The couple spent the day hiding from the crowd of journalist that flooded their neighborhood in the remote Russian region of Dagestan, according to ABC News.

Neighbors who did speak to the press said the Tsarneav family had no noticeable ties to Islamic fundamentalism or terrorist factions.

One neighbor said that there was no fanaticism among the family members living there and that the father was not too religious.

In her phone call with ABC News reporter 
Kirit Radia, Tsarnaeva reiterated the wild claims her husband has made 
in previous interviews that their two sons were framed by the U.S. 
government.

She said her oldest son Tamerlan, 26, was investigated two years ago by the FBI only because ‘he loved Islam’ and that he ‘didn't do anything bad.’

The FBI said in a statement released Friday that it had investigated Tamerlan Tsarnaeva in 2011 at the request of a foreign government. The FBI did not reveal which country’s government that was.

‘The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups,’ the FBI statement said.

The FBI said that in response to the request the bureau culled through its databases and interviewed both Tamerlan Tsarnaeva and members of his family, but were unable to find any evidence that he was connected to a terrorist organization.

‘The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011. The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government,’ the bureau’s statement read.

‘They were all afraid of Tamerlan’ his mother told ABC News referring to the U.S. government.

‘They wanted to eliminate him as a threat because he was in love with Islam. For the last five years they were following him.’

Tsarnaeva said the anxiety of losing both her sons has caused her to feel so sick she needs to call for an ambulance every two and a half hours.

‘I don't know how to live like this,’ she said.
