Two men died and three others were injured when a plane crash landed on top of a car in South Africa.

The pilot and his passenger, both aged in their late 30s, were killed instantly when their small Cessna aircraft plummeted out of the sky and nose-dived onto a Mazda hatchback.

But the motorist and his three passengers miraculously survived the bizarre smash, which happened yesterday on a busy rush hour road close to the country's capital Pretoria.

Police spokesman Samuel Kilian said 
the car passengers had watched in horror as the plane dropped out of the
sky towards their vehicle.

He said: 'The two-seater Cessna aircraft took off on a routine flight just before 6.30pm but very quickly got into trouble.

'It seems the pilot wanted to make an emergency landing on the road but he came down straight onto the car.

'The
driver of the car was concentrating on the road so didn't see anything 
until he heard a bang from above as it hit the top of his vehicle.

'Apparently some of the passengers had seen the aircraft coming down rapidly and shouted "plane" in the moments before impact.

'Sadly the two people in the plane died at the scene but those in the car escaped with their lives.

'It is something of a miracle that they survived.'

Paramedics rushed to the scene of the accident on the busy R55 near the town of Centurion, south of Pretoria.

Vanessa Jackson, who works for the private ambulance firm ER24, said the pilot and his passenger were pronounced dead at the scene.

She
said: 'When paramedics arrived, the small aircraft was in pieces and 
the plane had also crashed into a hatchback that had been travelling on 
the road at the time.

'Sadly
both of the occupants of the plane were deceased upon arrival of 
paramedics as they had already succumbed to the extensive injuries that 
they had sustained.Â 

'There was nothing further that could be done for them.'

Ms Jackson said one of the four men in the car escaped unhurt and the other three suffered minor injuries.

All four were treated for shock.

She
added: 'The three men who were in the hatchback suffered only minor 
injuries and after thorough assessment by paramedics, they decided that 
they would leave the scene with private transport and would see further 
medical attention at a later stage if it was necessary.'

Officials last night launched an investigation into what caused the accident.

It is believed the small plane had taken off from a private airstrip near Pretoria to take pictures of the region from the sky.

Air accident investigators are looking into what caused the pilot to apparently attempt an emergency landing ahead of last night's accident.

The car, a cream Mazda 323, was badly damaged in the smash.

Police confirmed the vehicle's windscreen was shattered, roof seriously dented and side smashed.

The accident caused the partial closure of the busy road, a secondary route which runs between Pretoria and northern Johannesburg.

Officials said it led to tailbacks for 90 minutes after the smash as teams worked to clear the debris from the tarmac.
