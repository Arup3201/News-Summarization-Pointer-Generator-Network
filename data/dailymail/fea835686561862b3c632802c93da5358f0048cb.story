Father's Day can be a bit tricky. First of all men always seem harder to buy for and this year I am determined to avoid the whole tie, cufflinks, socks and whiskey thing.

Adding to the pressure, it's my husband's first Father's Day as a qualifier and I want it to be really special.

As for the whole gifting process, the two non-lingerie arenas certain to exite him, electronics and power tools, I have utterly abandoned as I always seem to get it wrong, spending far too much money on contraptions that seem massively useful to me but are met with pretend enthusiasm and fake smiles. 

Give Dad a real surprise this Father's day by getting him something other than cufflinks!

Thus I have compiled a useful guide if like me; you still have some shopping to do:

A Baby Gadget He Will Actually LOVE

A car seat that turns into a pushchair in 10 seconds?  Be the first dad on the block to own the brand new Doona.  It's the first car seat ever to transform into a travel system in less than ten seconds (7 clicks).

It also fits down the aisle of an aeroplane. Suitable for newborns up to 13kgs. It's availlable for pre-order from Mamas  & Papas July 1st. £299

For the Father Who Looks After Himself

Knightsbridge based facialist Linda Meredith looks after some rather yummy Fathers such as Colin Firth, Rupert Penry Jones and Trevor Eve.

This year for Father's Day she has created a Gentleman's Collection, comprised of three select products designed to clean and hydrate and are ideally suited to a man's skin.  www.lindameredith.com £69 

Colin Firth and Rupert Perry Jones are known fans of Linda Meredith

The Back Rub you never have time for

Two words: Gel Shiatsu. That kind of sold it for me. This is a back and shoulder massager that promises a smooth but effective ride. Deep kneading HoMedics gel shiatsu massage relieves tight knots and it has a programmable remote control.

Pricey but…..wow. £249.99 available from www.Amazon.co.uk

Family Pictures that Look Good

No good pictures of everyone all together? Flytographer is new to the UK and is set up so that anyone can have professional looking family photos that don't look boring. 

You book online and a photographer meets you at whatever location you want. The group can be surreptitiously snapped having a walk by the river, during an afternoon game of football or even having a family lunch.

Flytographer's team have shot for publications like Vogue and Harpers' so they know how to find your good side. 

Once booked, you're assigned a shoot concierge to manage and organise. Available in 70 cities worldwide including North and South America, Europe, Asia and Ausralia. A 30 minute shoot with the photographer is £150. www.flytographer.com

The Face Saver

Something he can use every day – and besides, what's sexier than a close shave?  Braun CoolTecshaver, uses some kind of fancy cooling technology (they call it a mini fridge) inside the shaving head to cool the skin.

This reduces irritation and adds a little technology (gadget alert!) to the mundane. The best part, they are offering half price between now and Father's Day. £115 (regular RRP: £230) Available at Boots www.boots.com

From Baby

The Piggy Bank friendly option. Yes, my name is Ashley and I love Poundland. This year the bargain giant have some sweet frames and coffee mugs that say fantastically cheesy things like World's Greatest Dad.

Perfect to dad from baby. And at £1 you certainly can't complain about the price. 

For a pocket money budget try Poundland for some sweet Father's Day gifts

For Baby

As the baby grows he or she will more often than not be carried by dad. I love the new i-angel carrier which has a really unusual and kind of unique seat on it. The baby actually sits on it rather than hanging freestyle.

The carrier can be used in front or as a back pack. It alters the weight distribution to help dad's back and make for a comfy ride – it also protects against hip dysplasia. Works from birth until 3 years old. £89.99 www.dinkydragon.co.uk

Sporty Dad

I'm not wading into all the World Cup memorabilia on offer, because to be honest it feels completely overwhelming, like shopping at the Marble Arch Primark on a Saturday.

But if he is a football fan and you know his team, this gift is fun.  A personalised football from www.yoursportsid.com, a website that allows you to personalise a selection of Premiership footballs. 

You can choose their colours and use the 3D tool to rotate the football adding a name and a Happy Father's Day.  £14.95

A personalised makes the perfect gift for a footy mad dad!

Posh Leather

I have struck out twice now on wallets for my husband. Apparently some men are fussy about what they do with their coins. I think I've cracked it this year.

The Financial Times has commissioned luxury leather goods brand, Dom Reilly to create some high quality travel gear and I love the travel wallet. It's pricey at £195 but I think it's sure to please. It even has a hint of 'FT pink' in the lining.  www.ft.com/domreilly

Ashley thinks she has finally found the perfect wallet for her man

Everyone likes a good read

This pretty fancy and is about as far into ‘tech' gear as I go. Kindle Fire HDX has all kinds of amazing features I didn't completely understand but I did note the HD camera and reduced glare for reading in the sun.

It's light and has a Mayday button which puts you in touch with an Amazon expert to help you with anything, 24/7, 365 days a year.  You can watch movies on it and it has all-day battery life. The 7" Kindle Fire HDX is £199. The 4G version is £269 www.amazon.co.uk

Be Good to Yourself

If he still can't quit cigarettes, how about a pointed hint. A recent study showed that smokers are 60% more likely to kick the habit with the help of an e-cig. Furthermore, electronic cigarettes don't emit anything other than vapour, so they can be used around a baby.

A recent study for the UK Department of Health has shown that 98% of children whose parent smokes wishes that they would quit.

Damien Scott, from Gamucci, one of the UK's E-cigarette brands said: 'We would like to encourage more fathers to kick the habit this Father's Day. We would love to hear the stories of fathers who are dedicated to going smoke free for their kids, using the hashtag #QuittingforKids.' To buy see www.gamucci.com

Ashley suggests giving your dad an incentive to quit this Father's Day
