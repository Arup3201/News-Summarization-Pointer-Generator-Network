An Australian socialist organisation hit with a fierce wave of backlash over the cover of one of their publications has been forced to withdraw the offending image.

Red Flag, an online newspaper published by the Socialist Alternative, recalled a cover which featured the Prime Minister with a razor to his throat, the headline 'One cut we'd like to see' splashed below.

The cartoon is based on a poster by Michael Callaghan from 1977, which sees former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser with a blade to his neck with 'Give Fraser the razor' written underneath.

This image of Tony Abbott with a razor to his throat sparked outrage on the Socialist Alternative's Facebook page and they were forced to withdraw the cover

The poster was prompted by Fraser's decision to block supply which ultimately led to the Whitlam government's dismissal in 1975.

In a statement released by the Social Alternative on Tuesday morning Red Flag editors defended the message sent by the cover but said they were forced to withdraw it citing 'legal concerns'.

'"Give Fraser the razor!" was chanted by demonstrators in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane at mass rallies and strikes... The slogan appeared on placards, posters, and graffiti. It was even set to music,' they wrote.

'Tony Abbott’s budget, and the Liberal plans for slashing welfare and cutting wages, is far worse than anything that Fraser carried out when prime minister.'

News.com.au report that before the original post with the image of Tony Abbott was pulled down off the Social Alternative Facebook page, it recieved hundreds of comments against the 'violent' image.

The cover was inspired by Michael Callaghan's 1977 poster which featured former prime minister Malcolm Fraser with the slogan 'Give Fraser the Razor'

'Oh ... not cool. I’m no fan of the LNP — policies, parties, associates or leader — but this seems unnecessarily violent,' wrote one user, while another said 'dreadful picture. DO NOT CONDONE violence to anyone. Even Abbott. You LOST me off this page and as a supporter.'

However the Red Flag deny that they were trying to incite any physical forms of violence with the image.

'The razor was and is clearly metaphorical. Just as cartoons that depict Bill Shorten knifing Julia Gillard in the back are not suggestive of an actual physical attack but merely are visual representations of perceived betrayal, so the razor in both our cover and the original poster suggest that the prime minister should be cast aside.

Red Flag deny they tried to incite any violence with the cover, but make no apology for the statement they made with the image

'It is the height of hypocrisy to make a song and dance about an allegorical newspaper cover, while defending a government which just last week announced that it wishes to deport asylum seekers who have anything less than a 50/50 chance of being tortured or persecuted if they are returned to their “home country”.

Red Flag editors Corey Oakley and Ben Hillier closed the statement with 'The difference between this threat of actual violence and an allegorical cover could not be plainer,'  reiterating that they make no apology for the cover.

Historically, the razor is considered to be a symbol of Australia's corrupt past, and was also used by gangs as a violent weapon during the Depression.

The original poster featuring Fraser was sparked after the 1975 Constitutional Crisis - also known simply as the Dismissal.

Fraser came in to power as the 22nd Prime Minster of Australia after he played a key role in the dismissal of Gough Whitlam.
