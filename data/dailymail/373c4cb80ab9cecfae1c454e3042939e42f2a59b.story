Senior store managers at Tesco have been left outraged after being told their annual bonus will be slashed by more than 80 per cent.

Around 5,000 store managers and executives were sent a letter by boss Phil Clarke last week warning them that their annual performance-based rewards would be dramatically reduced following a dire year.

Last year the managers received 100 per cent of their bonus pot entitlement with many receiving on average £12,000, but this year it will drop to 16.9 per cent the equivalent of between £2,000 and £3,000.

Drop: Thousands of Tesco store managers and executives were sent a letter from boss Phil Clarke warning their annual performance-based rewards would be dramatically fall following a dire year

Most employees had been braced for a cut in their bonuses after the retailer posted a profit warning in January – its first in recent history - but the scale of the drop has taken many by surprise with morale said to be at rock bottom.

Cut: Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke has written to around 5,000 store managers and executives telling them their annual bonus will be slashed

Next week the retailer, which is the third largest in the world, will reveal the scale of pay and rewards for its board directors in its annual report.

In the current climate where fat-cat greed is firmly under the spotlight, Tesco managers want to see that board directors have been treated in the same way.

Over the past few months the retail giant has lost ground to its rivals amid fierce competition in its home market.

It’s big price drop campaign has been widely seen as a failure trounced by others who have attracted more customers with vouchers and fresher stores.

Tesco’s share-price has tumbled 21.42 per cent over the past 12 months.

In a letter seen by the Daily Mail, Clarke, who has taken over the running of the troubled UK stores, said: ‘Last year was a difficult one despite delivering another record set of results.

‘The group missed its profit targets and had a mixed performance across our six corporate objectives - we missed the threshold for UK return on capital employed and our UK like-for-like sales target.

‘Following a review of our performance for 2011/12, the executive committee has approved an award of 16.9 per cent of your maximum bonus.’

Succession: Phil Clarke last year took over as Tesco chief executive from Sir Terry Leahy who had been in the role since 1997

Staff are understood to have reacted badly after learning they will be entitled to the lowest proportion of the ‘short-tern bonus pool’ for 20 years. The rewards are closely linked to performance.

The letter was sent last week to senior store managers up to the level just below the board.

A spokesman for Tesco said: ‘Tesco’s top 5000 leaders, including the executive directors, all have genuinely performance linked incentives and these are closely aligned.

‘We will announce full details in our annual report published later this month and those at the top of the company will take their share of the impact of last year’s results.’

The issue of executive pay has become a lightning rod for investors who have seen share prices go south as bosses continue to reap fat-cat rewards.

Clarke, who succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive, posted a one per cent drop in annual profits from its UK stores to £2.5bn last month and denied that the supermarket giant is in trouble.

Between December and February underlying UK sales dropped by 1.6 per cent, and during the whole year they fell by 0.9 per cent.
