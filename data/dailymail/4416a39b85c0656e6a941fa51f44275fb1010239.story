England's manager, speaking at a supporters' q&a in Miami, said: 'That was his full debut.  He’s got to be very satisfied with it.

'I was anxious to play down the expectations, seen too many young players lifted to the stars, the new Keegan, the new Hoddle, the new Gascoigne, the new Terry, the new Rio, every time someone has a half a good game, they are the new star. 

'We believe in him but people shouldn’t be suggesting our World Cup should be hinging on his performance. He should be an England player for many years to come.'
