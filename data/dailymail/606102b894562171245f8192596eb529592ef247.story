The BBC1 adaptation of JK Rowling's novel  The Casual Vacancy has triumphed in the head-to-head battle of Sunday night dramas.

The Casual Vacancy, starring Michael Gambon, Rory Kinnear and Keeley Hawes, and Channel 4's 'epic' period drama Indian Summers, featuring Julie Walters in the lead, were pitted against each other at 9pm.

The small-screen version of Rowling's first novel for adults won the most viewers, peaking with 7.3 million.

The TV adaptation of JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy had an average of 6.6 million viewers last night

The drama, set in the seemingly idyllic, fictional English village of Pagford, where residents are at war with each other, enjoyed an average of  6.6 million viewers and a 27.5% share of the audience.

Indian Summers, set in the foothills of the Himalayas during the decline of the British Raj and the birth of modern India, attracted a peak of 3.4 million and an average of 2.9 million (13.4%) including viewers catching up on the plus one channel.

The latest instalment in ITV series Mr Selfridge took 3.5 million (14.5%) with plus one.

None of the three big-hitting 9pm dramas could better long-running Call the Midwife though, which drew in an average of 8.9million viewers.

It was screened on BBC1 at 8pm - pitting it against Top Gear on BBC2 and All Star Family Fortunes on ITV. 

Channel 4 said that they were delighted with the launch of their 10-part series, which  more than doubled its slot average and was the 'highest drama launch since Elizabeth I' in 2005.

The broadcaster's chief creative officer Jay Hunt  said: 'I'm thrilled that three million people were hooked by Indian Summers' unique mix of political intrigue and raw passion. It's an epic drama, uniquely Channel 4 in tone.'

It was revealed last week that The Casual Vacancy's ending has been changed for the small-screen to feature a 'redemptive moment', after its scriptwriter decided the novel's conclusion was a little too 'grim'.

Despite the tweaks, Harry Potter author Rowling has said that she is 'thrilled' with the TV adaptation.

ITV series Mr Selfridge brought in more viewers than Indian Summers - with 3.5million tuning in

None of the three 9pm dramas drew in as many viewers as long-running Call the Midwife - starring Emerald Fennell, Charlotte Ritchie, Helen George  and Linda Bassett - which was seen by nearly 9million people

Sunday evening has repeatedly seen some the largest viewing figures of the week - leading major channels to screen their best-loved shows.

The battle reached its peak two years ago when Call the Midwife - still screened at 8pm on BBC1 - and ITV's Downton Abbey were both screened on the same evening.

The two channels have previously put the results shows of their two hits Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor against each other on Sunday evening.
