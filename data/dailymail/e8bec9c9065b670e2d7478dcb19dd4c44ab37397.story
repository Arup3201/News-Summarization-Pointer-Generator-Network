Kobe Bryant is a man used to dominating on a basketball court, and he was up to his old tricks in China.

The five-time NBA champion showed no mercy when taking on a fan in a 1-on-1 battle in Shanghai during his tour.

Bryant was shown performing some of his signature moves and sinking jump shots on the court, something which he hopes to do more of with the Los Angeles Lakers this season.

Ambition: The 35-year-old will want to help the Lakers turn their poor 2013-14 campaign around

The 35-year-old is pleased to be healthy again after seeing his last year ruined by a knee injury.

But Bryant is ready to bounce back in the 2014-15 campaign as the Lakers begin a new era under recently appointed head coach Byron Scott.

Speaking last month in Brazil, when he attended the World Cup, Bryant said: 'I'm 100 per cent'.

The Lakers finished an abject 2013-14 campaign bottom of the Western Conference's Pacific division with a record of 27-55.
