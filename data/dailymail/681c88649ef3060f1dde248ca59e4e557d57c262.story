Hidden away on street corners or lined up next to bank branches, cash machines never grab a passer-by's attention, unless they need to withdraw money.

However, ATM's in Sydney may earn a few more side glances, as they have received glamorous makeovers.

The redesign by bank ANZ, was commissioned in time for the Australian city's world famous Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras

Glitter: The cash machines around Sydney have been given a makeover to celebrate Mari Gras

Fluffy: The holes-in-the-walls have been adorned with different textures and materials to celebrate the LGBT culture in the Australian city

Denim trim: Artists who were commissioned to design the machines added some fashion influences

A group of artists were commissioned by the company to 
transform ten of the bank’s hole-in-the-walls into GAYTMs.

The end 
result is a spectacular array of colours, patterns and fabrics.

Despite the fashionable overhauls, the bank has been forced to defend itself after a it was criticsed for profiting from civil rights issues.

Mark
 Hand, Chairman of ANZ Australia’s Diversity Council and the brains behind 
the operation, told news.com.au: 'We create a customer base that 
represents a diverse constituency.

'If you want to be a big, successful company in Australia there’s no way you can be as successful as you want to be if you pushed 10 per cent of the population aside.

'That to me just doesn’t make any sense, we have to make sure that we do things that appeal to every section of society.'

Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (SGLMG) is the non-for-profit member-based organisation that organises the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade and Festival as well as number of other events throughout the year.

Shop front: Most of the cash machines are outside ANZ branches. The festival finishes next month
