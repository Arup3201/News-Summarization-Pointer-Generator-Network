Klu Klux Klan members may have infiltrated groups supporting Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, it can be disclosed.  

Supporters for Darren Wilson have removed a photograph from their Facebook page in which activist group Anonymous claim to identify three members of the Ku Klux Klan.

Anonymous seized two of the Ku Klux Klan’s twitter accounts yesterday after the Klan distributed fliers threatening the use of ‘lethal force’ should violence erupt in the wake of Ferguson Grand Jury’s decision on whether to indict Wilson.

Now, as part of Anon Cop Watch, the group has circulated numerous photographs ‘unhooding’ Klan members.

Among them is one showing 13 members of the St Louis Klan. It is set shown alongside an image of a rally held in support of Darren Wilson rally in which, they claim, three Klan members feature prominently.

Tensions: Michael Brown (left) was shot dead in August by officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri, sparking massive protests over the death. A grand jury is deciding whether to indict him

One of them appears to be Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri and the man behind the recent fliers.

It is just the latest escalation of the racial tensions that were ignited this summer when officer Wilson shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18.

Protesters adopted the slogan ‘Hands Up Don’t Shoot’ - a reference to witness accounts claiming that Brown had his hands up when Wilson let off his fatal volley on August 9.

Less than two minutes elapsed between Wilson, 28, stopping Brown and friend, Dorian Johnson, as they walked down the middle of Canfield Road which snakes down from the main drag of West Florissant, and shooting Brown dead.

In the three months since that day Ferguson has been riven by violence, protest, gunfire and looting.

Brown’s own parents have consistently distanced themselves from the violence that saw protesters and police clash as battle lines were drawn near the scene of the shooting across night after night of riots.

But, with the Ferguson Grand Jury expected to deliver its verdict on whether or not to indict Wilson on a murder charge this week, the FBI have described violent civil unrest as ‘inevitable.’

Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown

Flashpoint: Ferguson is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations

Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death

Governor Jay Nixon’s decision to declare a State of Emergency and activated the National Guard on Monday was seen by many as confirmation that a decision from the Grand Jury is imminent. And prosecutor Bob McCulloch has always maintained that a verdict would be reached by mid to late November.

But leaks reported by the St Louis Dispatch, which suggest that the officer will not be indicted, have only heightened the likelihood of violent reprisal.

As MailOnline reported, ‘militant resistance group’ the Black Rebels has boasted of being ‘war ready,’ and stockpiling high caliber ammunition. While the Ku Klux Klan leaflets distributed in Ferguson and the surrounding towns suggest a similar readiness for violence.
