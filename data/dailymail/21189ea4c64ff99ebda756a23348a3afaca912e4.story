They say every picture tells a story and that's certainly true of a new time-lapse video that reveals 100 years of Iran's history with the help of a beautiful model. 

The '100 Years of Beauty' clip shows Iranian-American model Sabrina Sarajy being given a number of make-overs and then posing with a look that sums up the style of each decade.

The pictures show how fashion and beauty trends have changed over the years with iconic hair styles such as the finger waves of the Twenties and beehive of the Sixties.

The first look in the 100 Years Of Beauty video shows model Iranian-American model Sabrina wearing a white hijab with a monobrow and no make-up. Iranian women at this time had few rights

By the Twenties, women are gaining greater freedom, the hijab is a vibrant purple shade and exposes more of the hair which is styled in finger waves fashionable around the globe at the time 

But beneath the hair and make-up is a serious reflection on how the turbulent politics in Iran have influenced the appearance and role of women in society. 

The video begins with Sabrina make-up free with her long, frizzy hair lose around her shoulders. She is then given a 1910 makeover which means wearing a white hijab.

She does not have any make-up on to reflect the fact it was not worn by Iranian women at this time but her eyebrows are penciled in to create a monobrow, which many women had at the time as plucking, threading or waxing their eyebrows was not an option.

Women at this time had few rights and were excepted to be subservient to men - as reflected in Sabrina's sombre expression. 

In the Thirties, the hijab was banned shown by Sabrina ditching hers for a hat

The Iranian look of the Forties was one also popular in Britain and America - wavy hair and red lips

After 1910, the Iranian women's movement was established and the first Women Journal was published by women as they began to campaign for more rights and freedom.

This hopeful uprising is reflected in the fashion at the time. By the Twenties, women are still wearing a hijab but now it's a vibrant purple shade and exposes more of the hair.

Sabrina's look reflects the global trend at the time for finger waves in the hair while her eyebrows have now also now been styled. 

In the 1930s, the female movement really took off as Reza Shah Pahlavi came into power and banned the hijab. He believed that the headscarf was suppressing women.

The ban is shown in Sabrina's Thirties pose as she ditches her veil for a jaunty hat - fashionable at the time - over a curled hairstyle also in style across the world in the Thirties. Her red lipstick - another Thirties global trend - shows how make-up is starting to be embraced by more women. 

For the Forties look, Sabrina again shows how Iranian women at the time where influenced by style in the west. Her loose, curly hair and vibrant red lips would were replicated at the time by women in Britain and America. The model's broad smile as she poses shows how women at this time felt free, happy and hopeful.

The bold lipstick remains in the Fifties but the hair is more prim in the post Word War Two years

The iconic beehive was embraced by Iranian woman in the Sixties as well as feline flick eyeliner

In the post World War Two years in the Fifties, Sabrina's style is more subdued than in the Forties, the make-up remains but the lips as toned down to pink and the hair is curled but pinned back to look more prim and demure.

The Sixties look is another iconic style that would have been seen in capital cities in Europe and America as well as in Iran. This was the decade of the beehive and Sabrina's hair is piled up to create the look. Meanwhile her heavy make-up also reflects the trend for a feline flick of eyeliner to make the eyes appear bigger. 

Women at this time in Iran were being given greater freedom, respect and power. They were beginning to establish careers with Farrokhroo Parsa becoming the first woman to hold a cabinet position as Minister of Education in 1969.

In the Seventies, the heavy make-up remains with smokey eyes while the hair is Charlie's Angels inspired with long, loose waves. Sabrina again looks happy and flirtatious as she flicks her hair over her shoulder. 

During the Seventies, Iranian women were granted equal rights in marriage and divorce and it appeared their oppression was coming to an end. 

But this all changed in the Eighties, as reflected in Sabrina's look which is more reminiscent of the 1910 pose.

After the 1979 Iranian Revolution the hijab was enforced again and women were stripped of many rights 

In 1979, the Iranian Revolution took place and the status of women regressed. Wearing the hijab was enforced, many of the rights they had been granted were withdrawn and Parsa was executed.

Sabrina's look reflects the repression of the time as she wears a black headscarf that completely covers her head and neck - save for one strand of loose hair which she obediently tucks out of sight.

She's stripped of make-up and her face is downcast and unhappy.

By the Nineties, she's smiling again. The hijab remains but now it's a vibrant blue shade with spots and it doesn't cover her forehead as much so her parted hair can be seen. She clasps her hands as if praying for a better future.

The Green Revolution is shown in the 2000s look with Sabrina wearing a green hijab and war paint

Sabrina's next look reflects the Green Revolution in Iran and their ongoing struggle to attain human and civil rights.

The model dons a green hijab with the front strands of her hair loose around her face and she applies green war paint across her cheeks.

She rises her hand - also covered in green paint - in a V sign and her eye make-up is muted shades of green as she stares defiantly into the camera.

For the final look , Sabrina's hair is long and loose around her shoulders and then loosely covered with a bright red hijab which she later pulls down so it rests on her shoulders. Her make-up is pretty but subtle and she confidently smiles at the camera before walking off screen. 

The clip is the fourth in The Cut's series of time lapse beauty videos. In previous videos, they have shown how women's style and fashion in American has changed over the past 100 years.
