The mayor of a Los Angeles suburb has died after being shot multiple times in the torso by his wife during an argument - but she has been released without being charged.

Lyvette Crespo, 43, shot her husband Daniel Crespo, 45, to stop him from beating their 19-year-old son, who had intervened as the couple fought at their home in Bell Gardens at 2.30pm on Tuesday.

Mayor Crespo was pronounced dead at hospital, Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. His wife was detained and questioned, but later released without being charged.

Family members said the couple, who had been married since they were teenagers, had recently been fighting about money, KTLA reported.

Sheriff's homicide detectives 'determined that no arrests will be made at this time' after interviewing Mrs Crespo, the department said in a statement late on Tuesday.

'The facts of the case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office who will determine if criminal charges will be filed.'

Paramedics were called to the couple's Bell Gardens condominium shortly after 2:30 p.m.

Crespo and his wife had gotten into an argument in the master bedroom of the home, Hernandez said. Crespo's brother, William, told KTLA that the mayor had wanted to sleep but his wife wouldn't let him. 

'He was tired, he was working all night, and working the days,' he said. 'He wanted to sleep. She wouldn’t let him sleep.'

Their son, Daniel Jr., 19, tried to intervene and Crespo got into a struggle with him. Crespo then punched his son in the face, NBC LA reported.

His wife then grabbed a gun and shot Crespo several times in the torso. He died en route to a hospital, Bell Gardens Fire Department officials confirmed.

Crespo's  son was taken to a hospital for injuries to his face from the struggle and was then questioned by authorities.

Crespo and his wife were high school sweethearts who married in 1986. They met in New York, according to a biography on the city's website. 

The couple then moved to Bell Gardens and they had a daughter in 1987 and a son in 1994.

'I couldn't believe it - I still can't believe it,' Crespo's brother, William Crespo, told NBC Los Angeles. 'I have a sick mom and now my brother is gone. He loved (his family) more than life. He loved his wife a lot, he always loved his wife.'

State lawmakers said they were shocked and devastated by the news of Crespo’s death. 

State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and state Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) released a joint statement on Tuesday night, saying that the shooting death of Crespo 'is shocking and a tremendous loss for our close-knit community'. 

'Mayor Crespo was a respected public servant who dedicated his life to protecting and helping others in southeast Los Angeles and throughout the region.'

The city's website on Tuesday night had an image of a black bow and a statement from Mayor Pro Tem Priscilla Flores and three council members that said the shooting doesn't appear to be related to Crespo's mayoral activities.

Tragedy: The shooting stemmed from an afternoon quarrel between Crespo, 45, and his wife, Lavette, 43, that escalated when their 19-year-old son, Daniel Jr., intervened

'Our thoughts and prayers should be with Mayor Crespo's family at this tragic time,' the statement said. 

Bell Gardens, a suburb of about 43,000, is located about 18 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Crespo was elected to the City Council in 2001. The council is a part-time job and members take turns serving as mayor.

Crespo, who had been a county deputy probation officer for the past 15 years, was first elected to the City Council in 2001, according to the bio posted on the City of Bell Gardens website.
