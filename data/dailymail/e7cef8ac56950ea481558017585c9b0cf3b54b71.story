A Pennsylvania groom who spent his wedding night behind bars after getting into a bloody brawl with the boyfriend of a pregnant teenager got some good news today, as most of the charges against him were dropped.

Mark Williams, 33, arrived in Pittsburgh Municipal Court this morning holding his wife's hand as he learned he would not be charged with riot, harassment and resisting arrest as a result of the events that took place at his wedding reception.

He does still face being convicted of disorderly conduct and criminal mischief, much lesser charges.

The groom and his wife, Edyta Williams, both seemed happy with the result.

'This was a significant misunderstanding. I never doubted Mark once,' the bride told KDKA.

The waitress and her boyfriend claim they did not want to deal with the 'drama' of going forward with these charges. 

Williams was accused of getting 'touchy-feely' with an unnamed 19-year-old pregnant waitress at his Aug. 31 wedding reception aboard a Gateway Clipper cruise down Pittsburgh's Monongahela River.

The waitress alleged Williams even tried to pour liquor down her throat, and grew so uncomfortable around him she called boyfriend Tyler Smith, 20, to come pick her up at the end of the cruise. 

That is when the bloody brawl broke out.

Smith confronted Williams at around 1 am on Monday, Sept. 1, and when they started to trade punches, Williams' brother David and groomsman Brian Taylor jumped in the melee.

Taylor, 31, who is a member of the Sto-Rox School Board, punched through a car's window. 

David Williams, a 35-year-old Pennsylvania State trooper, ignored orders to back down and eventually assaulted two Pittsburgh police officers who were called to the scene,according to authorities.

All three were taken to Allegheny County Jail.

Breaking it down: 'I would say this was an alcohol-fueled event,' said the groom's lawyer, William Stockey (above)

Since then, Taylor and the groom have paid for damages to the car, and all charges were dismissed against David Williams earlier today.

'There are two sides to every story… and this one here, we felt the facts as they were presented in the criminal complaint were wholly inaccurate,' said David's defense attorney, David J. Shraeger. 

Mark's defense attorney William Stockey may have put it even better though, telling reporters, 'I would say this was an alcohol-fueled event.'
