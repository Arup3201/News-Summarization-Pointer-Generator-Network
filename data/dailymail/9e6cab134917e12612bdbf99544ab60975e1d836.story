Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter could be planning a comeback via Twitter.

The former glam rock artist, 69, appeared to send a message from a new account @LeaderIsBack along with the message: 'Fans and music lovers await the return of GG.'

The message was accompanied by a photo which purported to show the disgraced musician in his living room wearing sunglasses, a fedora hat, a cream suit and carrying a red umbrella.

'Fans and music lovers await the return of GG': disgraced singer allegedly sent tweet along with image purporting to be of himself standing in his living room

The new Twitter account was set up on October 29th but has attracted just 91 followers

While the account is still active this afternoon, the tweet has now been deleted.

The message has provoked outrage from other users of the social networking site, with many asking for the account, which was set up on October 26 and has just 91 followers, to be taken down.

One user, who calls herself Mandy, messaged Scotland Yard saying: '#stopchildabuse Please have this removed from Twitter.'

Another user called Chris Brown added: 'Go back under the rock you came from! There are no second chances for individuals like you.'

Glitter, a former glam rock performer, was convicted of possessing child porn images in 1999 and of molesting two girls in Vietnam in 2006. He now faces fresh child abuse allegations after the Savile inquiry

While a hoax Gary Glitter page was 
exposed two years ago after apparently messaging news of another 
comeback, according to The Sun on Sunday Glitter's ex-bandmate Gerry 
Shepard's widow Claire is running the new account with his consent.

However any return to performing could be cut short this week when Glitter learns if he is to face fresh charges of child abuse in connection with the Jimmy Savile investigation.

Glitter was convicted of possessing child pornography in 1999, and was found guilty of molesting a pair of girls aged ten and 11 by a Vietnamese court in 2006.
