Investigation: Detectives from Scotland Yard were today interviewing an Australian woman  Lauren Martell in connection with sex abuse allegations levelled against entertainer Rolf Harris

It was reported earlier that two Scotland Yard officers had travelled to Australia in March in relation to the Harris investigations.

But it was learned today that two officers are still in the country, although it is not known if these are the original pair.

One is the officers has been identified as Detective Sergeant Gary Pankhurst from Scotland Yard's Specialist Crime Directorate, Child Abuse Investigation Command.

Mr Pankhurst, whose photo was published in Australia today by Sydney's Daily Telegraph as he walked with an Australian Federal Police Officer, told he paper he could make no comment on the investigation because it was still continuing.

Inquiry: Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia

Harris has already been interviewed twice in Britain but no charges have been laid and he has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.

He was questioned as part of Operation Yewtree, sparked by the numerous claims of sexual abuse by Jimmy Seville.

Neither is it known at this stage whether Mrs Martell once lived in he UK.

Police began interviewing her at noon in Australia (3am London time today).

Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia as part of their on-going investigations into the claims against Harris. 

Future: Mrs Martell said the two Scotland Yard officers had indicated to her that they might fly her to London to give evidence, should the investigations lead to a court appearance

She also said that the two Scotland Yard officers had indicated to her that they might fly her to London to give evidence, should the investigations lead to a court appearance.

Just what Mrs Martell told the police during the lengthy interview at her home has not been revealed.

They put questions to the former accountant  over two and a half hours.

The detectives have given no indication who they intend to interview next - or where their inquiries in Australia will take them.

The trip to Wisemans Ferry, some 45 miles north west of Sydney city centre, took the detectives into one of the most picturesque regions of New South Wales.

It is described as a rustic village on one of Australia's most famous waterways, The Hawkesbury River.
