Hint? Rupert Murdoch tweeted today that the Scottish are 'better people than to be dependants of London' as people believe his newspapers will back independence

Rupert Murdoch was today accused of readying his newspapers to back Scottish independence and his 'old friend' Alex Salmond.

The media tycoon, who owns The Sun and The Times and a Scottish-based Sky TV call centre, said today: 'Scots are better people than to be dictated to by London'. 

His latest tweets are the biggest hint yet that his Scottish newspapers will side with the 'Yes' campaign, and admitted himself he is 'wrestling' with the idea.

Mr Murdoch, who has Scottish ancestors, has previously described Alex Salmond as the ‘most brilliant politician in the UK’ and two years ago tweeted: ‘Let Scotland go and compete. Everyone would win.’. 

Critics have suggested the break up of the United Kingdom would be his 'revenge' for the damage caused to him and his businesses by the hacking scandal. 

He tweeted today: 'Scots better people than to be dependants of London. Hard choice with real pain for some time. Maybe too much.

'Wrestling with Scottish vote. Scottish Sun No. 1. Head over heart, or just maybe both lead to same conclusion'. 

In a further message Mr Murdoch also suggested Scotland had declined because of being part of the UK, saying it was 'sad' that the fishing village his 'forefathers' came from are 'now totally silted up'.

His grandfather, Patrick John Murdoch, left Aberdeenshire for Australia in 1884 and he would qualify for citizenship if he wanted it.

Critics have accused him of trying to influence next Thursday's poll and expect his Scottish papers to back the Yes campaign.

Labour MP Tom Watson told MailOnline: 'Here we go again, Rupert Murdoch and his old friend Alex Salmond. 

'This is new politics just like the old politics. Murdoch is trying to dictate the agenda’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband brushed off Mr Murdoch’s remarks, suggesting the media tycoon does not want what is best for Scotland. Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: ‘As far as I know he doesn’t want a social democratic paradise.’ 

Supporter: Mr Murdoch, who has Scottish ancestors, has previously described Alex Salmond, together in 2007, as clearly the ‘most brilliant politician in the UK’

Other Twitter users have also turned on Mr Murdoch's tweets in recent days, even those who back the yes campaign.

Yes supporter Misssy M wrote: 'Typical of Murdoch. Sniffs the wind and pretends it's him who changed it. Get tae, Rupert. We don't want you nor need you. This is our vote'. 

Labour activist Taylor James Scott said: 'Genuinely who cares what Rupert Murdoch's view is on Scotland's future? Given his actions in recent years I imagine the answer is no one'.

Cameron Calder ‏said: 'Natz (nationalists) actually believe Murdoch cares about Scotland rather than getting revenge on UK'.

One of his papers, the Sunday Times, published a poll at the weekend that showed the nationalists had pulled ahead of no voters. 

The Scottish Sun, which is Scotland’s best-selling daily newspaper, backed Mr Salmond’s SNP in the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections, but it did not support independence.

At the weekend, following news of the YouGov poll for The Sunday Times, Mr Murdoch tweeted ‘everything up for grabs’.

He added: ‘Scottish independence means huge black eye for whole political establishment, especially Cameron and Milliband (sic).

‘Scottish poll reflects world-wide disillusion with political leaders and old establishments leaving openings for libertarians and far left'. 

Some have claimed that his interest in the break up of Britain is based on revenge for the hacking scandal

Andrew Neil, a former editor of The Sunday Times, wrote on Twitter that he thought Mr Murdoch was preparing to support a Yes vote.

He said: ‘Strong indications from Murdoch and Salmond sources that Scottish Sun will back independence, despite protestations of London Sun editor.

‘He thinks hacking scandal was revenge of the British establishment on him. Break up of Britain would be his revenge.’
