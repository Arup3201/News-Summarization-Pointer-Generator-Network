Ben Stokes smiles as he contemplates a reputation as the wild child of English cricket that not even early displays of rare class have enabled him to shed.

Last winter saw the extremes of a maiden Test century in the toughest of circumstances in Perth and a broken wrist suffered while punching a locker in frustration for a man who was once sent home from a Lions tour in disgrace.

It is the more positive side of a gifted cricketer who should be at the forefront of the England team for the next 10 years that Alastair Cook and Peter Moores want to see as they begin their build-up to February’s World Cup.

Stokes is hoping to be an integral part of the England squad for next year's World Cup

Stokes joined England at Loughborough on Tuesday for a three-day training camp ahead of their one-day tour of Sri Lanka later this month and insisted that the self-inflicted indiscretions that have hindered his progress are a thing of the past.

‘I now know you can’t let emotion get the better of you,’ said the all-rounder who guided Durham to the Royal London Cup last summer.

‘Everybody knows I lost my temper easily when I was a kid and tended to look away from the game itself. Now I can manage that to make sure I’m getting the best out of myself.’

The locker incident, which came in Barbados as Stokes struggled to end a run of low scores, cost him his place at the World Twenty20 and at the start of a summer where he failed to nail down a regular place in all formats.

But he insists it was not a symptom of a bigger problem for a 23-year-old who has invited comparisons with Andrew Flintoff as much for his off-field habits as for his exciting all-round performances on it.

‘That incident was totally from wanting to do so well,’ said Stokes. ‘It wasn’t like I had lost my mind and become a psycho. It was completely my own fault, but I never want to lose my emotion. I now know that I shouldn’t punch lockers. It’s just about dealing with failure in the right way.

‘Mind you, the opposition could be scared of me, thinking, "I don’t want to get on the wrong side of him." I could just give them the "psycho" eyes then! I don’t think angry is the right word to describe my attitude but sometimes I have been overly competitive. When I don’t do what I want it can become frustrating.’

It will be a more grown up Stokes, he insists, who is about to embark on a prolonged spell of one-day cricket he hopes can help England upset the odds at the World Cup in Australia and his native New Zealand. Not least in his attitude to the prospect of the arrival of his second child.

His partner Clare is expecting their daughter on February 21, just two days before England face Scotland in Christchurch where Stokes was born and bred before his family emigrated for Cumbria when he was 12.

It provides a quandary that Stokes has a mature approach to. ‘If I can get back and the baby comes at a time when it doesn’t affect the cricket I will do but I don’t want to miss any big matches,’ he said.

‘We have talked about it and Clare completely understands my job and the situation. She actually said ‘if we tell our daughter you missed her birth because you were playing for your country I reckon she will think that’s quite cool’.’

That match in Stokes' old home town will see him come face to face with his county captain Paul Collingwood, who this week rejoined the Scotland coaching staff. ‘I’ve played with him for a long time and he’s a great captain and coach but it will be nice to beat them and rub it in his face,’ smiled Stokes.

More mature, perhaps, but clearly still with a competitive sense of mischief.
