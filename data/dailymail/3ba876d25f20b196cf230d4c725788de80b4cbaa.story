An 18-year-old threatened to burn down his family home and knife his mother after she bought him the wrong kind of trainers for Christmas.

Jake Wilder leaped for a kitchen knife, screaming 'I'll jab you!' in front of his younger siblings after opening his present from under the tree.

When the teenager said he was going to burn down the house in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, his mother, Rachael Anderson, called the police, a court heard.

Today, Wilder was banned from visiting his mother, and handed a suspended 21-day jail sentence for the 'extremely hurtful' attack.

Magistrates heard that Wilder, his older sister and two younger siblings were at home with their mother, Mrs Anderson, for Christmas Day.

But the festivities came to a halt when Wilder opened his mother's present towards the end of the day.

He broke into a rage, advancing on his mother in front of his siblings.

On Boxing Day, officers arrived to arrest the teenager and he admitted common assault in a police interview.

'An argument broke out over some trainers she had bought him and there were young children present,' said prosecutor Clare Barclay.

'He was aggressive towards his mother and threatened her with a kitchen knife, saying 'I'll jab you'.

'He also threatened to burn the house down and she called the police.'

Howard
 Wilson, mitigating, told the magistrates in Oxford that Wilder was now 
living in the same road as his mother, with a friend.

'He has apologised to his mother and sister for the words he used, which must have been extremely hurtful,' he said.

Wilder wore a white baggy jumper and grey tracksuit bottoms and smirked at two friends during the hearing.

Presiding magistrate David Simmons told the teenager: 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious offence.

'The use of a knife in a domestic setting makes this a very serious incident and the fact that young children were present to witness it makes it worse.'

Wilder was sentenced to 21 days in prison, suspended for one year, and ordered to pay £85 pounds costs and a £60 pounds victim surcharge.

He was also made the subject of a restraining order banning him from visiting Mrs Anderson.

Mr Simmons added: 'You need to get some help for the problems you are having in dealing with aggression and in particular towards family members.'
