With the recent influx of foreign footballers plying their trade in the Premier League, English clubs have been subject to heavy criticism for not fielding enough homegrown players.

The days of a full starting XI of Englishmen are well and truly gone at the top of the table, as on average only 3.5 make it into their respective strongest first teams.

Leading the way with the most Englishmen in their starting XI are Liverpool - who have six England players making the strongest team.

Manchester City however, only have one regular English starter in goalkeeper Joe Hart, and his only compatriot in the squad, James Milner, is often overlooked in favour of foreign team-mates.

Three Lions: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere at England's London Colney base on Monday

Liverpool: 6

Formation: 4-2-3-1.

Mignolet; Johnson, Sakho/Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Lallana, Sturridge; Balotelli. 

Brendan Rodgers' philosophy of buying and nurturing English players has paid dividends to the club's recent success with six players making the starting XI.

Raheem Sterling was sensational for Liverpool last season, a product of Melwood training academy which has also produced the likes of ex-England captain Steven Gerrard who is still a regular starter for the Merseyside club.

Southampton: 5

Formation: 4-3-3.

Forster; Clyne, Fonte, Yoshida, Bertrand; Ward-Prowse, Schneiderlin, Davis; Tadic, Pelle, Rodriguez.

Boasting a highly successful training academy, Southampton have earned a reputation for churning out impressive young English players such as Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Ward-Prowse to name a few.

Although only the latter is still at the club, Saints have replaced academy players that have left with English players such as Nathaniel Clyne, Jay Rodriguez and Fraser Forster.

Arsenal: 5

Formation: 4-2-3-1.

Szczesny; Chambers/Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Wilshere, Ramsey; Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud/Welbeck.

Four English players: Calum Chambers, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and new signing Danny Welbeck make the Arsenal strongest XI when fully fit.

Arsene Wenger’s recent £12m capture of versatile defender Chambers from Southampton has proved a shrewd acquisition, as the young Englishman has settled in to the team well with inspiring performances at both full back and centre back this season.

New man: Danny Welbeck has signed for Arsenal for £16million from former club Manchester United

Changing their ways: Arsenal now have five likely starters who are English, including Calum Chambers (right)

Formation: 4-2-3-1.

Howard; Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines; Barry, McCarthy; Mirallas, Barkley, McGeady; Lukaku. 

Everton: 4 

Leighton Baines, Gareth Barry and hot prospect Ross Barkley all make the starting XI of Roberto Martinez.

Barkley is widely regarded as a potential England starter for Euro 2016 due to the 20-year-old's assured performances in the Premier League at a young age.

Nationality: When he returns from injury, Ross Barkley is one of four likely English starters for Everton

Tottenham: 3 

Formation: 4-2-3-1.

Lloris; Dier, Vertonghen, Kaboul, Rose; Capoue, Bentaleb; Lamela, Eriksen, Townsend; Adebayor. 

Mauricio Pochettino’s purchase of Erik Dier from Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon takes the total number of Englishmen who make the starting XI to three.

Although Andros Townsend was left out of Roy Hodgson’s squad for the qualifier against Norway, Danny Rose’s inclusion follows an impressive start to his Premier League campaign, keeping new signing Ben Davies out of the team despite coming to the club this summer.

Manchester United: 3

Formation: 3-5-2.

De Gea; Jones, Evans, Rojo; Valencia, Shaw/Blind, Herrera, Di Maria, Rooney/Mata; Van Persie, Falcao.

Although boasting the new Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney, this Manchester United side under Louis Van Gaal only boasts three starting Englishmen.

A far cry from the class of ’92, with only Phil Jones, Luke Shaw and Rooney making the XI assuming every player is fit. 

Captain fantastic: New England skipper Wayne Rooney is one of just three likely English starters for Man United

Chelsea: 2

Formation: 4-3-3.

Courtois; Azpilicueta, Cahill, Terry, Ivanovic; Matic, Ramires, Fabregas; Willian, Hazard, Costa.

The only two English players which make Chelsea’s starting XI are centre-back pairing Gary Cahill and John Terry.

Apart from the defensive duo, Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea don’t have a single other English player in their full squad, meaning they have the second fewest in the top eight.

Manchester City: 1

Formation: 4-4-2.

Hart; Zabaleta, Mangala/Demichelis, Kompany, Kolarov; Yaya Toure, Fernandinho, Navas, Silva; Aguero, Jovetic.

Man City’s sole English inclusion in their best starting XI is No 1 Joe Hart.

Hart bucks the trend of Englishmen being replaced by foreign players by holding the City No 1 jersey for the last four seasons, making 190 appearances.
