The Union Flag is to be plastered across big money projects paid for by the UK taxpayer to show the public where their taxes are spent.

Ministers will announce tomorrow the plan to brand roads, flood defences and broadband hubs with the message 'Funded by the UK Government.

It will be used on projects across the UK, but will prove provocative in Scotland where the move to highlight UK spending will be seen as a challenge to supporters of independence.  

The new logo will be unveiled by ministers tomorrow, and will be used on any project funded by the UK taxpayer

Treasury minister Danny Alexander, who is a Scottish MP, will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area 'from Cornwall to Caithness'

Treasury minister Danny Alexander, who is a Scottish MP, will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area 'from Cornwall to Caithness'.

Under the plan, any firm who wins a UK government contract will have to agree to display the logo on the finished work.

Treasury insiders insist that the logo is not designed to challenge Scottish nationalists, but promote the need for investment across the UK. 

'It is just a reminder to people that this is where their money is going.' a source said. 

The use of the logo will seek to emphasise that major investment in big money projects is only possible thanks to the strong economic growth, and Scotland as a result of remaining in the UK.

However, some areas of infrastructure are devolved, so will not apply in Scotland. 

The logo will also draw comparisons with a similar image used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by Britain.

It copies a long-standing Brussels agreement which sees the EU flag displayed on infrastructure which it has funded.

The Treasury says that there is £466billion of new projects in the pipeline, which the Government is helping to fund using public money.

Mr Alexander said: 'I've prioritised infrastructure in this government because only long-term investments will support UK businesses and get the public finances and economy on a firm footing.

'It's only right that we recognise the contribution of the UK taxpayer in supporting this economic growth, which is why I'm delighted to launch these Union Jack plaques, which will proudly adorn infrastructure investments from roads in Cornwall to broadband in Caithness.'

The plan has been drawn up with Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who said: 'As part of our long term economic plan, this government is investing in our nation's physical and digital infrastructure.

'Whether it's High Speed 2 investment in the Northern Powerhouse or superfast broadband connecting Cornwall and Wales, all future infrastructure projects funded for by UK taxpayers will carry this simple UK flag branding.'

In 2012 a similar logo was introduced for foreign aid funding, which included the Union Flag and the words: UK aid from the British people'.

Under official rules, its use is not optional but 'is a condition of accepting funding from DFID'. 

Despite the insistence that the logo is not designed to counter Scottish independence calls, ministers are understood to be concerned about the rise in support for the SNP since voters in Scotland rejected independence in the historic referendum held in September.

The use of the logo is seen as a small step in shoring up support for the UK north of the border, with the SNP set to make big gains in May's general election.

In the event of a hung Parliament, Labour could be forced to depend on nationalist MPs for support, raising the prospect of a second referendum on independence.

SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie described the plaques as a 'silly gimmick' which did not disguise the coalition's cuts to overall infrastructure spending and Scotland's capital budget.

He said: 'Putting a sticker on projects is a silly gimmick by Danny Alexander and his Tory bosses, which can't cover over the fact that his government at Westminster has slashed infrastructure spending - destroying jobs and delaying economic recovery - including cutting Scotland's capital budget by a quarter.

'Despite this, the Scottish Government is delivering over £11 billion of investment over the three years to 2015-16. Instead of the huge cuts imposed by Danny Alexander and the Tories, people across the UK would prefer more infrastructure investment, and fewer gimmicks.'
