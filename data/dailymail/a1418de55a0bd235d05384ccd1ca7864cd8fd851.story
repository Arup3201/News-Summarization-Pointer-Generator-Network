Catfight: Marjory Ramson, 83, has had a solicitor¿s letter demanding £500 compensation for a bite inflicted by a cat which she no longer consider hers (file photo)

When her cat decided to move in with the neighbours, Marjory Ramson assumed he was no longer her responsibility.

Not in the eyes of the law. The 83-year-old has had a solicitor’s letter demanding £500 compensation for a bite inflicted by Henry the ginger tom.

The victim, Linda Close, says the wound was so deep she had to spend four days in hospital and faced possible amputation.

The grandmother-of-six-says she has never had any problems before and said the cat was well-behaved ever since her late husband bought it three and a half years ago.

After being confronted by Miss Close after the incident, Mrs Ramson agreed to have Henry put down – much to her distress as the cat was a reminder of her late husband, Bob, who passed away aged 85.

The grandmother of six, who works part-time in a charity shop, said: ‘The cat was a great comfort to him when he was dying so it was always nice to see him around.’

But as cats often do, after the death of its owner, Henry left Mrs Ramson’s home and became something of a ‘neighbourhood pet’.

Shortly afterwards he was taken in by a family who lived behind the Ramsons’, who renamed him Cyril and let him sleep at the end of their bed.

Earlier this year, however, the family moved home, letting the property to Linda Close and her two teenage children who agreed to continue taking care of him.

But on the day they moved in the 46-year-old full-time carer says she was bitten so badly the doctors said her hand may need to be amputated.

She subsequently captured the cat, took it to the vets and discovered it had been micro-chipped and belonged to the Ramsons.

It was then that she consulted Ralli Solicitors, who wrote to the 83-year-old.

The letter demand she pay £500 for Miss Close’s medical report and stated: ‘The reason we are alleging fault is that you are negligent and/or breached your statutory duty pursuant to the Animals Act.

‘We allege that your cat exhibited characteristics which were known to you as its owner and that you failed to take sufficient steps to prevent the attack.’

But Mrs Ramson said: ‘I was so shocked to receive the letter, at first I didn’t even believe it was for me. I thought it must be some mistake.

‘I liked seeing Henry every now and then and would leave milk out for him, but as far as I was concerned he had moved on as cats often do.

‘I haven’t been able to sleep ever since and I just don’t know what to do. When I first received the letter I was worried that they’d send me to prison,’ she said.

‘If it is true what happened to this lady, it is very unfortunate, but it honestly has nothing to do with me.

She added: ‘The only time he ever bit me was when I stood on its tale once and it gave me a nip, but I didn’t draw blood.’

However, Miss Close, who is a full-time carer for her mother and father who live next door, said she believed Mrs Ramson knew about the cat’s alleged aggressive behaviour.

‘I love cats and have them as pets and this has never happened to me before,’ she said.

I lent down to give him a stroke, he rolled onto his back and was purring then he suddenly bit into my hand with both paws.

‘It left two marks on my hand, which by the morning had swelled up like a balloon and I couldn’t move my thumb.’

She said she couldn’t drive because of the swelling and had to call her friend to drive her to A&E, after her local GP told her the infection was serious.

Miss Close said she has ‘never been so scared in her life,’ adding that doctors told her they feared she may have to have it amputated.

‘I was worried I wouldn’t be able to care for my parents,’ she said.
