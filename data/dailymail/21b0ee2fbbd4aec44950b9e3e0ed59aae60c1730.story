Killed: Former mechanic Ross Waters (pictured) led police in a 110mph chase along two motorways

A father-to-be was killed as he ran across a motorway after telling his fiancée 'it ends tonight' during a 110mph police chase, an inquest heard.

Former mechanic Ross Waters, 33, sparked the 30-mile pursuit after a heated row with two friends at the home he shared with Laura Swarbrick in Blackpool, Lancashire.

He tried to follow them home and rammed their car outside a police station before escaping onto the motorway, evading tyre spikes and a police roadblock before continuing, fatally, on foot.

An inquest in Preston, Lancashire, heard Mr Waters had been suffering the effects of a devastating brain injury he had received in a 2004 car crash.

The incident had left him unable to remember his family, where he lived or what he liked to eat.

After he met Ms Swarbrick they moved in together in Blackpool. She fell pregnant with his child, and they were due to marry.

But on November 10 last year, events took a fatal turn after Mr Waters had a row with his fiancée's visiting friend Carl Noblet and his wife Tammy.

The couple left to go home at around 8.30pm and spotted Mr Waters tailgating them in his Ford Focus Sport, they told the inquest.

Mr Noblet said: 'At first it was close enough that I couldn’t see its headlights. Obviously when a car is that close it’s a little weird.

'I didn’t know who it was. Then the car backed off enough to see the number plate and it was Ross Waters’ car.

'When I realised it was him I decided to keep driving and not go to my home because I wanted to avoid confrontation. I travelled around for a while and he continued to follow.'

Mrs Noblet then received a warning text message from Mr Waters' fiancée.

'It said "Ross is in the car behind you. He is threatening to ram you off the road."', Mr Noblet said.

'I told Tammy to phone 999 and then we went to the police station, but he drove into the rear driver’s side of my car.'

Pleading: Fiancée Laura Swarbrick (left arriving at the inquest) told the hearing she spoke to Mr Waters (right) 'the whole time' on the phone. She added: 'He kept repeating "it ends tonight," "enough is enough"'

Fatal night: How the chase unfolded, first within Blackpool and then for 30 miles down the M55 and the M6

Mr Noblet jumped out of his car in a bid to restrain Mr Waters, but the passenger door was locked - prompting the former mechanic to try and mow down Mr Noblet's wife. 

She was thrown onto the bonnet as Mr Waters continued driving, and only rolled off when he turned right at a junction. 

Mrs Noblet told the inquest jury: 'I stopped and screamed to Carl to get the kids. I heard an engine and lights and that is all I remember apart from screaming.

'I remember seeing his face when I was on the bonnet. I was looking at him and still on the phone to the police. But when I came off the car it’s a daze.'

Officers inside the nearby South Shore police station heard the commotion and gave chase, scrambling the force helicopter.

They tried to stop Mr Waters as he returned home but he escaped - jumping a red light before driving onto the M55 and then the M6 towards Wigan.

For the entire chase he was on the phone to his fiancée, who said he was 'very agitated' and 'worked-up'.

She told the inquest: 'I was trying to diffuse the situation and was on the phone to him whole time - even when he hit Tammy. I heard the screams from Tammy.

'He was saying that he knew he was in trouble, "enough was enough" and he could not handle prison.

'I said I would wait for him if he went to prison. After that was a running commentary of speed, what he had done and what he was doing.

Ms Swarbrick told the inquest: 'He was screaming. I was screaming. I had been begging him to stop'

'I know Ross, he would just disappear and deal with his anger in a sense. For him it could have been in any forms. Because of the argument which occurred I just though he was disappearing.

'I took [the argument] to be about our relationship. He knew he was in trouble. He was screaming. I was screaming.”

'He kept repeating "it ends tonight," "enough is enough." I had been begging him to stop.'

Police tried to lay tyre spikes in the carriageway but Mr Waters veered across two lanes to avoid them, running over traffic cones and driving at motorway patrol officer Gary Holliday.

'I heard an extremely loud bang,' PC Holliday said. 'My partner was screaming at me to get out of the way.

'We were showered with debris. I ran back toward the police car. I described the sensation as standing on a platform when a very fast train comes past.' 

PC Glen Hilton added: 'It passed within a second of Gary clearing the carriageway. I said to Gary: "I think he has just tried to kill you."' 

Officers then tried in vain to stop Mr Waters using a rolling block involving several patrol cars.

But when one patrol car pulled out in front, Mr Waters clipped the back of it - sending the car careering into a field.

Sgt Tracey Ward, who was in the car, said: 'We felt we were airborne for what felt like ages but probably only a few seconds. At that point I didn’t know whether we were going to die or not.'

By this point his car was left with just three fully working wheels, and one bare metal rim.

Police pulled back and allowed the force helicopter to track the Focus, which Mr Waters eventually stopped near the M6 Charnock Richard services, just north of Wigan.

He tried to run across all six lanes of traffic - but was fatally hit by a passing Mitsubishi 4x4 on the opposite carriageway.

He suffered multiple injuries and died instantly, the inquest heard.

His final words to his fiancée were: 'I have stopped. Are you happy?'   

The inquest continues.
