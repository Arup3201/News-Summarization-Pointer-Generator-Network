Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews shows off his recent weight loss in new topless pictures, which he achieved in just a week through intensive detox and workout at a boot camp.

The Eton educated star has lost over a stone in total, losing 13lbs in the first three days alone.

Spencer, 25, admits he looked at little flabby and out of shape in the 'before' picture taken on arrival in Ibiza, admitting he had 'let himself go' due to the recent turbulence in his love life.

Spencer lost over a stone (but gained a tan!) in the course of just a week at the boot camp in Ibiza

Spencer dropped the pounds through intense exercise regimes, which he confesses he found hard, combined with a strict diet

The training, which combined cardio with strength training, lasted for 8 hours a day and was over seen by ex-military trainers to insure the intensity never dropped

The character we love to hate on the hit channel 4 reality show, Spencer ended his two year relationship with co-star Louise Thomas in the latest season.

As well as seeing her move on with his friend Andy Jordan, Spencer had his emotions further bruised by being rather unceremoniously dumped by Lucy Watson who he had begun to date. 

He lost more than a stone in weight at No 1 Boot Camp, a diet and fitness retreat which co-star Binky also used to shed unwanted pounds.

He says: 'You have to look good in my career and obviously I've been failing miserably in that recently.

Spencer claims that his turbulent love life in the most recent season of Made in Chelsea had caused him to become 'beastly'

The boot camp involved long walks and runs in the hills of Ibiza as part of the eight hours daily exercise

'In recent episodes of Made In Chelsea I looked quite beastly, I'd let myself go.

'Being in a relationship for so long, you end up getting lazy, ordering pizzas.

'The
 turbulence of falling in and out of love has made it difficult not to 
go out a lot and when you're socialising you're drinking - and I've not 
been thinking too much about my health and weight.

'There is absolutely no moderation in my life.'

Spencer
 got back in shape during a punishing week at No 1 Boot Camp where he 
cut out the alcohol, ate very little and trained intensively for eight 
hours a day.

The camp is based in a villa situated in the north-west of the island near to the tranquil resort of Santa Eulalia. 

The change in his body is obvious, but he admits the process behind this achievement was not easy

Spencer explains: 'It was amazing. The boot camp trainers had me up at the crack of dawn doing punishing work-outs and then in the afternoon we would do four-hour hikes up the hills and coastline of Ibiza.

'It was beautiful and also very tiring, but the end result was great.

'I lost just over a stone in a week. In fact, I lost 13lbs in three days!

'We trained very, very hard and ate very little - it was a brilliant kick-start to get myself back to fitness.'

The
 camp uses ex-military trainers to really keep the guests motivated, 
combined with a diet of low-fat food cooked by Michelin-starred chefs.

The stunning surroundings and weather must have made the harsh workouts and diet a little easier

Spencer says he is pleased with the results of the week and the changes to his body, but claims there is room for improvement and he will repeat the boot camp soon

Spencer  - now happily settled with his 22-year-old Made In Chelsea co-star Lucy Watson again - admits that when he starts exercising it quickly becomes an addiction.

He says: 'There is absolutely no moderation in my life, I'm afraid, but the only real addiction I get is going to the gym.

Spencer booked for a week after his Made In Chelsea co-star Binky Felstead,22, lost a stone at the  camp's sister site on the North Norfolk coast.

Spencer is delighted with his results in his appearance, saying: 'My jawline has started to reappear!'

He is enjoying life with his latest 
love interest Lucy - and has no regrets about the bitter split with 
co-star, 22-year-old Louise.

He
 says: 'What I learnt from my last relationship is that if you want to 
sleep with other people, you should end things because it's not going 
anywhere. I should have split with Louise six months ago.'

And Spencer isn't finished with his make-over, insisting he can look better.

'I'm
 going back to No 1 Boot Camp when we finish the filming of this series 
of Made In Chelsea. I need to finish the job and get seriously ripped!' he says.

Spencer blames the turbulent nature of the last season for his weight gain

In the latest episode of the new season to air Lucy Watson tells Spencer she's not interested in him, although they are now together
