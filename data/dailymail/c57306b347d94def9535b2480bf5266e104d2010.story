The body of 12-year-old Pierre Barnes is thought to have been found off the Riviera Coast - five days after he went missing while exploring a holiday resort.

Divers discovered the body this afternoon on the seabed on the French island of Porquerolles at 4pm British time.

It is understood to have been identified by his parents after being recovered following an extensive search of the island.

His British father Stephen Barnes, a company director from Grantham, Lincolnshire, and his French mother Florence raised the alarm after Pierre failed to return as night fell in 100mph winds and mountainous seas.

More than 100 French firemen, Gendarmes and soldiers plus volunteers scoured the island for three days without finding any sign of the boy.

His cycle with its chain derailed and one of his shoes were found near a cove which he had told his parents he wanted to visit.

Mayor of the town of Hyères on the French
mainland Jacques Politi said this afternoon that the theory that Pierre
met with an accident was the most probable in what he described as 
‘hostile weather conditions’.

Prosecutor Xavier Tarabeux revealed that sniffer dogs brought in to search for him had all led their handlers to the sea shore close to where the bike was found.

This led them to believe that Pierre had probably been swept out to sea by a wave.

Pierre was the youngest of four children who had gone to the island for a week’s half term break and were staying in rented accommodation. 

In a television interview Mr Barnes 
said this week that three days after his disappearance, the family were 
starting to come to terms with the fact that he was probably dead.

He described his youngest son as a ‘cheerful little fellow' who was doing well at school and loved Doctor Who.

When he went off on his bike ride he was wearing his favourite dressing gown , a rugby shirt and jeans.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph before his body was identified, 57-year-old Mr Barnes said he
was confident the body would prove to be that of his missing son.

He told the paper: 'I have been informed by the police that they have found a body on the island.

'I will go and identify it within the next two hours but I have no doubt it is Pierre.'
