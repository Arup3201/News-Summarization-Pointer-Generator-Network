Police are hunting a group of exhibitionists who had an orgy on a beach in front of shocked onlookers. 

Up to five men and women performed sex acts in broad daylight on Jersey’s Le Saie beach, a popular beauty spot, over the course of five and a half hours.

Officers have questioned four people and are yet to make any arrests, but believe there are more witnesses who have not come forward.

Officers said the incident happened 'between noon and 5.30pm' on Tuesday, August 5, on a secluded stretch of beach near Le Mont De Rozel on Jersey’s north east coast.

The beauty spot in Saie Harbour is described by World Guides as one of the best in the Channel Islands, known for its 'tranquil' and 'untouched' beauty.

The four or five participants were seen engaging in various 'acts of gross indecency' which sparked complaints.

Officers particularly want to hear from anyone who was on the beach when the incident began.

A spokesman for Jersey Police said: 'Police are currently investigating an incident that occurred during the afternoon of Tuesday 5th August 2014 on Le Saie Beach, Le Mont De Rozel.

'The incident involved four or five adults engaging in acts of a sexual nature on the beach.'

It is not known whether the participants were locals or holidaymakers.

Police have also declined to say what type of sexual activity is believed to have taken place, or how many witnesses there were.

However, the incident comes in a summer which has seen Britons hit the headlines for public sexual activity at European holiday resorts.

Earlier this week a young man and woman were filmed apparently having sex in the sea, in full view of families in the Spanish resort of Magaluf.

While some onlookers were shocked, others cheered and applauded the two lovers.

A British girl was filmed in the same resort last month performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar in just two minutes as part of a bar crawl.

In events which prompted outrage at the bar crawl's organisers, the 18-year-old was allegedly told she would win a 'holiday' which turned out to be a £4 cocktail of the same name.

Jersey's legal system defines 'gross indecency' as any deliberate act which 'right-thinking members of the public would regard as grossly indecent'.

One Jersey resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'You hear about this sort of thing happening in boozy Spanish holiday resorts but not on Jersey.

'You expect a better class of people here, but then nothing seems to shock you these days.

'It’s a secluded spot and quite a hike to get up there - that’s possibly why they chose the area.'
