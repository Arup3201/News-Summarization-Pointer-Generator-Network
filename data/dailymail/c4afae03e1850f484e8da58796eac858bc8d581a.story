Princess Mary of Denmark put on her best comfiest casual attire to hit the green and show off her royal putting style at a recent charity golf bash in Denmark.

The 42-year-old was having a ball on her day out on her own without husband Prince Fredrick Denmark and their four children - Christian, Isabella, Vincent and Josephine.

Clearly very proud of her moves, a very relaxed princess broke out in a spontaneous jig of jubilation to the impressed onlooking crowd at the Asserbo Golf Club on Tuesday.

Not even the pressure of all eyes on the Princess of Denmark's every move could wipe the smile from her face during the light-hearted match.

Princess Mary attended the event to hand out awards to the junior club members for selling lottery tickets to the benefit of the Children's Aid Day in Frederiksvaerk.

Her appearance comes as rumours stating that Australia's Princess Mary is to be crowned the Queen of Denmark as the current Queen nears abdication have been slammed by the royal family.

Woman's Day claimed that the coronation of Mary and her husband, Prince Fredrick, could be announced in 'just weeks', in their latest publication on Monday.

The magazine said the reason Queen Margrethe was stepping down was due to her 'bad back' which has prevented her from attending many royal functions recently.

However, a Danish publication ended the rumours however, with a comment from a Royal House spokesperson who described them as 'nonsense'.
