Tragic: PC Andrew Bramma, pictured, died after his car crashed into a tree when he was responding to an emergency call

This is the police officer who was tragically killed on duty when the patrol car he was driving while answering a 999 call crashed into a tree.

Pictured for the first time, PC Andrew Bramma - who was was attending reports of a road accident - died at the scene after the crash at 7pm yesterday in the village of West Tanfield, near Ripon, North Yorkshire.

North Yorkshire Police said PC Bramma, 32, who was married and had two young sons, only transferred to the force from Greater Manchester Police four months ago.

North Yorkshire Police say that an online book of condolence has been started for people to pay tributes to the officer.

Shadow home secretary and Yorkshire MP Yvette Cooper said: 'This is terrible news. The officer was working to help others and keep people safe, in this instance responding to an emergency call.

'All our sympathies and thoughts go out to his family and friends.

'Police officers across the country put their lives at risk every night so we all can be safer and more secure, and they deserve our deep gratitude.'

He was described by Temporary Chief Constable Tim Madgwick as having 'everything you would hope for in a young officer.'

The popular officer had worked on the beat in Greater Manchester for four years before transferring to North Yorkshire Police.

He
was based in Harrogate and worked as part of a local safer 
neighbourhood policing team. He had been helping out his colleagues from
Ripon when he died. It is unclear why PC Bramma transferred.

Speaking
at a press conference outside Harrogate Police Station, Mr Madgwick said: 'It is with deep sadness 
and regret that North Yorkshire Police announces the death of a serving 
police officer.

'He worked in Harrogate as part of the safer neighbourhood policing team and was a valued part of it.

'It is terrible and tragic news and the thoughts of everyone at North Yorkshire Police are with his young family.

'He was held in high regard and has been a much valued colleague since joining the force just four months ago.

'Andrew was a great transfer and we were looking forward to him spending the rest of his career with North Yorkshire Police.

'He had everything you would hope for
in a young officer. As a Chief Constable it has left me with a deep 
sadness and almost a sickly feeling.

'I just sense he was someone who wanted to be here and wanted to be part of our team.

'He
extolled the virtues of what we are looking for in North Yorkshire 
Police, he cared about the community, he wanted to do his job and 
protect people and he did it for the very best reasons.

'He
was a man of integrity and he was popular with his colleagues and as 
Chief Constable I cannot ask for more of a young officer.

'I believe he was on 
patrol when he received the call about the RTC. While he was based in 
Harrogate he was helping his colleagues in Ripon on this occasion.

his loss.’

Tributes were paid to PC Andrew Bramma on Twitter today

PC Bramma's former colleagues from the B relief team at GMP's Rochdale division issued a joint statement to express their sorrow at the death of an ‘A* standard’ officer.

They said: ‘Last night we received the worst news any police officer could wish to receive - that a close colleague and friend, PC Bramma, had been taken from us in tragic circumstances, whilst doing the job he loved of helping people in their hour of need.

‘Andrew was a great police officer and a loving family man. For anyone who knew him, Andrew was meticulous in everything he did, nothing would ever beat him and he would leave no stone unturned to find his answers. Every job he dealt with was always done to A* standard.

‘Andrew leaves us all with many lasting memories - from being such a great friend, to the large amount of hand gel and protective blue gloves he used to go through at work that we teased him about daily, to being a very proud and true Yorkshire man.

‘We were all proud to know and work alongside Andrew and hope to lead by the high example he set for us to follow. Our thoughts are with his wife, two lovely sons and other family and friends at this time.’

Anyone who was in the area at the time and saw the vehicle or witnessed the collision is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101.
