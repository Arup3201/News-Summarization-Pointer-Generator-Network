They are words of comfort from a mother to her daughter, assuring her never to forget how she is loved, even in her 'darkest of times'.

And, as Erica Lafferty struggles to deal with the death of her mother and the letter's author, Dawn Hochsprung, never before has she needed the loving words more.

Mrs Hochsprung, the Sandy Hook Elementary School principal, became one of Adam Lanza's 26 victims on Friday as she heroically charged towards him in a bid to save the school's children.

Lafferty, her youngest daughter, has now revealed that her mother would write her 'Just Because' letters to tell her what the young woman meant to her.

Missed: Sandy Hook school principal Dawn Hochsprung, who died in the massacre on Friday, would write letters to her daughter, Erica Lafferty (right), to tell her how much she loved her

Struggling to contain her emotions, Lafferty read one of the letters on the Today show on Tuesday.

'Today I stopped and thought what a wonderful daughter I have,' the front of the card reads. 'And I thought I'd tell you.'

'My dearest Erica, you are and forever will be my sweet baby girl,' Mrs Hochsprung wrote. 'You 
possess a piece of my heart and soul and I will never be complete 
without you.

'Remember this in your darkest times. You are never alone. Your mum.'

On another page, she added: 'Be safe. Be well. Be happy. No one deserves it more.'

Loving: One of the cards to her daughter bears the now poignant message: 'Be safe, be well, be happy'

Letter: Lafferty said she came across her mother's heartfelt note in the aftermath of her killing

Lafferty read out the heart-breaking letter after she discovered it while searching for photographs in the aftermath of her mother's killing.

She explained it was written after 'the first time I moved out. I went back and forth [to home] a couple of times because I was a mumma's girl and always needed her close.'

Smiling, Lafferty also paid tribute to her caring, selfless mother as she spoke to Today.

'To say she was a wonderful person is the understatement of the century,' she told Savannah Guthrie as her fiance, Christopher Smegielski, stood beside her in Newtown, Connecticut.

'She put her life into making everyone else's lives so much better. Her 
smile lit up every building she walked into.

Support: Lafferty, who weds this summer, appeared on the show with her fiance, Christopher Smegielski

'She made an impact on 
everyone that she's ever come across. Every adult, every child - 
especially the kids. [They were] the light of her life.'

Lafferty added that she was finding it 'tough' after her mother's death. Hochsprung, 47, died as she tried to stop Lanza, 20, from entering the building, where he fatally shot six adults and 20 children.

'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on.

'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

As Lafferty struggled to control her tears, her fiance stood beside her.

Traumatic: One of the third grade students said 
that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that 
she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say 'put your hands 
up'

Happy: George Hochsprung said he and wife Dawn planned to spend 
years together at a house they had built

'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter,' Smegielski said. 'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible.'

The mourning family has also seen support from across the country, and even from President Obama, who posed for photographs holding Hochsprung's granddaughter.

Obama met with families of victims ahead of an interfaith memorial ceremony in 
Newtown on Sunday night, and Hochsprung's daughter Cristina Hassinger posted images of him and the baby to 
Twitter.

'My mom would be SO proud to see
 President Obama holding her granddaughter,' she wrote alongside the photograph. 'But not as proud as I am of 
her.'

Mrs  Hochsprung's husband has also spoken about how his world was shattered in light of her death.

Devastated: Her daughter tweeted the picture and expressed her grief at losing her mother

George   Hochsprung said that the 
initial anger he felt after hearing that his wife confronted LanzaÂ  has
 gone away since he heard from two of the teachers that she helped save.

'Dawn
 put herself in jeopardy and I have been angry about that - angry - until 
just now, today, when I met the two women who she told to go under 
shelter while she confronted the gunman and she could have avoided that,
 but she didn't and I knew she wouldn't,' Mr Hochsprung told CNN.

I'm not angry anymore, I'm just very sad.'Dawn 'ran out, and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes from, Dawn was five-foot-two.'

Though the specifics of the timeline of events inside the school are still being ironed out by investigators, it is thought that Mrs Hochsprung was the one who may have thought to turn the intercom system on so that the entire school would be immediately alerted to the impending danger.

Emotional: George got choked up and Erica began weeping during an interview about the principal's life

One of the third grade students said 
that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that 
she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say, 'Put your hands 
up'.

Tales of her heroism are helping Mrs Hochsprung's relatives process their grief, but only slightly.

'Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,' Mr Hochsprung said.

'And the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be Dawn's house: I was going to die because I'm much older than Dawn, it was going to be Dawn's house.

'Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful.

'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me - I don't think I can do that.'

Crime scene: Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning

Mr Hochsprung met Dawn when she was his boss, working as the assistant principal in the area middle school while he was teaching seventh grade math.

It was actually one of his students who told him the devastating news on Friday morning.

'One of the kids came up with a computer and said: "Something's happening at Sandy Hook school and you're wife's been killed",' George told CNN.

The Hochsprung family is made up of George's three daughters from his first marriage, Dawn's two daughters from her first marriage, and their collective 11 grandchildren.

A tearful Erica said that if she was given the chance to say one 
final thing to her mom who she called 'my rock', it would be simple: 
'Come back, just come back.'
