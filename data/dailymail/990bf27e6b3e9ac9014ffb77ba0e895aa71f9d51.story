A cosmetic surgeon who put patients in danger by teaching nurses how to administer Botox illegally has been banned from the medical profession for a year.

Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses £400 a day for training courses on injecting the toxic drug at his Harley Street clinic.

Showing a ‘cavalier’ attitude to safety, he told them to give Botox to patients without a prescription.

He admitted the practice was ‘naughty’ but said regulation was so lax they would get away with it.

It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a £4million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than £1million from the scam.

But Harrison, managing director of Harley Aesthetics, was exposed by an undercover BBC investigation in which a journalist posed as a trainee nurse to film him secretly.

Yesterday he was condemned for his ‘flippant, cavalier and deplorable’ attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing.

The Fitness To Practise panel found him guilty of misconduct by encouraging the nurses to break the law and suspended him for 12 months.

Botox is normally administered by a doctor to a patient with a valid prescription after a face-to-face consultation.

But Harrison found a loophole in the law at the time that allowed remote prescribing in exceptional circumstances, and he authorised nurses to perform the procedure by speaking to them on his mobile.

He charged £30 for each ‘consultation’ and offered one-day training courses at his practice for nurses who wanted to administer Botox.

The 2012 BBC investigation alleged Harrison told nurses to use Botox prescribed for one patient on another and actively encouraged them to not pay adequate regard to a patient’s medical history before administering the jabs.

The millionaire – who also owns a six-bedroom Gloucestershire mansion with a nearby private stable for his seven polo ponies and properties in the French Alps including a £1million chalet and a hotel – boasted in his company newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions, suggesting he made £1.5million from the phone calls alone.

His company, one of the UK’s largest purchasers of Botox, charged patients from £200 for a treatment.

He was filmed telling nurses: ‘Strictly speaking, a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No. It is not legal but it’s what everybody does, doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name – it’s not policed at all.’

Harrison also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before giving Botox they should go ahead and he would authorise it afterwards.

Suspending him following a hearing in Manchester, the panel said: ‘The findings against Dr Harrison are wide-ranging, some are repeated and involve the potential to place patients at risk of harm. His conduct... could properly be described as deplorable.’

In a letter to the panel, Dr Harrison said: ‘I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable.

'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it. I do not encourage nurses to do that.’

In the wake of the investigation into Harrison, the GMC has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation.
