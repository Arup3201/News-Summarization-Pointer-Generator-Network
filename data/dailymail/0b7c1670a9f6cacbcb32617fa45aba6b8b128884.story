A machete-wielding bank robber chose the wrong time to rob a bank after he was floored by a cage fighter and bouncer who were waiting in the queue.

Steve Harris, 32, pushed his daughter to one side before leaping on the man who was threatening staff and customers with a 15-inch blade.

Bouncer Darren Frost, 42, then joined in and grabbed the man while the pair scuffled on the floor.

Meanwhile a pub landlady, well trained in dealing with brawls, pinned his hands to the floor and called the police.

Rugby player Mr Harris said his training from the sports field and the cage came in handy during the drama at Lloyds bank in Taunton on Monday.

He said: 'I saw him in the corner of my eye and I could see he had a weapon of some sort - I thought it was an iron bar.

'When he was around four feet away from me, I pushed my 15-year-old daughter to one side and tackled him.'

The 6ft former bouncer - who is a tree surgeon by trade - added: 'It happened so quickly, I was making sure he did not hurt anyone including my daughter.

'I tackled him to the floor and others helped restrain him while I put him in an arm lock until police arrived.'

Bouncer Mr Frost, who is 6ft and weighs more than 17 stone, added: 'People were shouting and screaming; it was sheer panic.

'I was not going to let Steve deal with him on his own so I helped out - it was very quick and very spontaneous.

'I didn't really think much of it at the time, and it was only when I was sat on him that I realised it was Steve, who I had worked with in the past.

'When the guy came in it was mostly families and old dears - I think the next day he probably realised coming in when me and Steve were there.'

Beverley Higgins, landlady at the Black Horse and King's Arms pubs in Taunton, said she held the man's hands once he was pinned to the floor before calling the police to the lunchtime drama.

'I am trained in dealing with confrontation so the situation seemed to be under control,' she said.

Bystander Robert Pink, who was cashing a cheque at the town centre branch, said he initially thought it was a training exercise because of the swift action of his fellow customers.

He added: 'It was the girls behind the counter who were most affected by it all.

'It is very open-plan in there so it was quite scary.'* A 32-year-old man has been charged with attempted robbery and possession of a bladed article and will appear at Taunton Crown Court later this month.
