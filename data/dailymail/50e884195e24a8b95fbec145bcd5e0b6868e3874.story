WEALTHY criminals are being given millions of pounds in legal aid, an investigation has revealed.

It uncovered almost 50 instances   over the last three years of millionaire defendants receiving an average of £300,000 in taxpayers’ money after exploiting a legal loophole.

In one case, two defendants were handed legal aid of £100,000 each to defend themselves against charges that they had masterminded one of Britain’s biggest ever tax frauds –  although they lived in homes worth millions of pounds.

In another trial, a fraudster received more than £5million of taxpayers’ cash, despite owning a £6million property in Mayfair, Central London.

However, the scandal may extend even beyond these shocking cases. The quango which presides over legal aid, the Legal Services Commission, refuses to reveal the exact amount handed in legal aid to rich criminals on the grounds that the information is ‘private’.

Scandal: Tax fraudsters Shakeel Ahmad (left) and Syed Ahmed (right) were worth millions but still managed to claim huge sums in legal aid by using a loophole

Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald QC is among those who are now demanding reform of the legal aid system.

He said: ‘It’s completely wrong. The taxpayer shouldn’t have to pay the defence lawyers for wealthy criminals.’

The loophole is a result of controversial legal rules, under which assets that have been frozen by the authorities cannot be used to pay defence bills.

This allowed VAT fraudsters Syed Ahmed and Shakeel Ahmad to plead poverty during their trial and each receive £100,000.

Disgrace: Syed Ahmed said he was penniless but while on trial was living at his £4.5million home at Wellington Court in Knightsbridge (pictured) - one of the most exclusive blocks in London

At the time, Ahmed lived in a £4.5million flat overlooking Hyde Park and Ahmad lived in a £2.2million home in Middlesex.

The two were members of a gang which set up fake companies to claim millions in VAT back from the taxpayer fraudulently.

Investigators found that they owned a string of luxury properties and expensive cars.

Ahmed and Ahmad were jailed for seven years in 2007 and given additional jail terms of ten years in 2010 after they had refused to reveal where they had hidden their fortunes.

Fraudster Virendra Rastogi, who received £5million in legal aid despite owning a seven-bedroom home in Mayfair, was chauffeur-driven to court on every day of his trial, while yacht-owning multi-millionaire fraudster Raymond May was handed more than £400,000 in legal aid.

In theory, the loophole in the rules is to enable assets to be preserved so that they can be confiscated after conviction.

But in many cases criminals are successful at hiding their assets from the court, and escaping without financial sanction.

Convicted criminals owe more than £1billion in unpaid confiscation orders.

Leading legal figures told a joint investigation by the London Evening Standard and BBC1’s Inside Out that the rules should be changed to stop taxpayers being cheated.

Lord Macdonald said: ‘The Government has got a real blind spot, because we have a situation where fabulously wealthy people are not being required to spend their own money on legal representation and are instead getting legal aid. I am talking about people worth tens of millions of pounds getting money from the state to fund representation in criminal cases.

‘Legal aid has been cut for people who have housing problems, it’s been cut for people who have welfare problems, people right at the bottom of the pile.

‘It’s not fair that very rich people are getting legal aid and very poor people aren’t.’ Michael Turner QC, the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, criticised the Government for refusing to release the figures which would reveal the full extent of the scandal.

‘This is something we have been concerned about for some time,’  said Mr Turner. ‘This is another example of the taxpayer being made to take the burden when there are potentially funds there to ease that burden. That would allow legal aid money to go to those who need it most,’ he added.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Offenders who can afford to contribute to the cost of their defence should do so.

‘Reforms to asset freezing are being considered to ensure that both proceeds of crime and legal aid costs are recovered.

‘We want to collect more money, not just change how the money we currently seize from criminals is distributed.’
