Former Southampton midfielder Matt Le Tissier took to Twitter to complain after having his sign confiscated at the World Darts Championship on Saturday night.

Le Tissier used his sign to show a Premier League table, in which Southampton lie fourth, having beaten Arsenal last week to open up a two-point gap.

But the Saints legend was annoyed to find that security deemed the sign inappropriate, taking it away from him.

'Can't believe I had my sign confiscated at the darts last night,' Le Tissier tweeted, following it with the hashtag #killjoy.

Fans at Alexandra Palace are encouraged to write their own messages on the signs during the matches.

However, as Le Tissier later confirmed on Twitter, the venue has a policy of 'no football signs' which led to his card being taken away. 

Top seed Michael van Gerwen crashed out of the competition on Saturday night to Gary Anderson, while Phil Taylor beat Raymond van Barneveld in the second semi-final.
