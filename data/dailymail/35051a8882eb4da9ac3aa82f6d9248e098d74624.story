The son of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro today described the severe beatings he received when he was a child and expressed relief that his father will never be able to hurt anyone again.

Anthony Castro appeared on the Today show this morning, a few days after his rapist father accepted a plea deal which will see him spend the rest of his life in prison for the kidnap and repeated sexual assault of three women.

He said: 'I cannot express how happy I am that my father will never be able to hurt anyone again. Behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life. I have absolutely nothing to say to him.

'What he did still haunts me. I have the same name as him and when I look in the mirror I see the resemblance and I think about what he did and how horrible it is and I am overcome with that.'

Speaking out: Anthony appeared on the Today show this morning a few days after his rapist father accepted a plea deal which will see him spend the rest of his life in prison

Describing his upbringing at the hands of his father, he said: 'He was incredibly strict, he had a temper. I mean he wasn't a monster 24/7 but if you crossed him there would be consequences'

Anthony said: 'He's been lying to his family for the past ten, 11 years at every possible turn. I have no trust in him. I can't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again'

Describing his upbringing at the hands of his father, who on Friday blamed porn and child abuse on his sickening crimes, he said: 'He was incredibly strict, he had a temper. I mean he wasn't a monster 24/7 but if you crossed him there would be consequences - more often than not they were physical.

'I would cry myself to sleep because my legs were covered in welts from his belt and I had to watch my mom get beat up. No one should ever have to see their mom crumpled in a heap on the floor beaten.'

By accepting the deal on Friday, Castro escaped the death penalty and withdrew his previous not guilty pleas in all 977 counts against him.

It also means his three victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus will not have to testify about their more than ten-year ordeal in front of a jury.

Anthony Castro told the Today show the fact his father will never see the light of day again is justice for his mother, who would have turned 50 this week.

He also said he has no plans to go and see his father in jail.

'He’s been lying to his family for the past ten, 11 years at every possible turn. I have no trust in him,' he said. 'I can’t see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again.'

In a MailOnline exclusive after Castro's three victims were freed, Anthony revealed his dad padlocked the doors leading to his basement, his attic and his garage and never allowed his family inside.

'The house 
was always locked,' Anthony said. 'There were places we could
 never go. There were locks on the basement. Locks on the attic. Locks 
on the garage.'

Among his infrequent contact with his father one conversation particularly stood out in his mind that occurred around mid-April, when Castro asked him whether he thought police would ever find Amanda Berry.

When Anthony said he thought Berry was likely dead because she had been missing so long, Ariel responded: 'Really? You think so?'

On Saturday, Amanda Berry made a surprise 
appearance at the day-long concert RoverFest in Cleveland, walking on stage with her family and waving at the cheering crowd
 before reemerging later again to join rapper Nelly.

Wearing
 sunglasses and dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt, Berry smiled 
broadly while acknowledging the applause, but she didn't address the 
crowd.

The announcer called for 'a bigger round
 of applause and cheer...than any of the acts that are here' and said 
after she arrived on stage: 'I told her she had a little bit of time to 
make up on the partying and you guys could help her out tonight'.

Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday

Guilty: Under the plea deal, Castro, 53, will spend the rest of his life behind bars plus 1,000 years, without the possibility of parole

Castro said at his hearing: 'There 
are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems 
throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights 
and the sentence'

All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support

On Friday, the 
judge asked Castro if he understood that he would die in prison and there 
would never be a possibility he would be released.

He replied: 'I do understand that and I said because of the sex crimes I knew I would have the book thrown at me.

'There 
are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems 
throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights 
and the sentence.'

He said he read and signed the plea deal and understood it though 'my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has taken a toll on my mind' that sometimes caused problems with comprehension.

Offering some form of an explanation for his despicable crimes, he said: 'I was a victim as a child and it just kept going.'

The judge cut him off and told him to save his story for his sentencing hearing.

The 53-year-old spoke clearly and intelligibly, answering all the judges questions with clarity. This is in stark contrast to his previous appearances when he has kept his head down, closed his eyes and refused to interact.

Plea Deal: Ariel Castro, 53, walks into the court room with his head down for a pre-trial hearing on charges including rape, kidnapping and murder in Cleveland, Ohio July 24, 2013

Prosecutors said if evidence of additional crimes came to light, Castro could still be indicted on future charges that included the death penalty.

Castro's
 lawyers have said for weeks that they would consider an agreement under
 which the former Cleveland school bus driver would plead guilty to some
 charges in return for his life.

Castro,
 53, has been charged with 977 counts including kidnapping and repeated 
rape. He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law 
for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry.

Gina
 DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27 were freed from 
Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland in May.

The three women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Each said they had accepted a ride from Castro, who remained friends with the family of one of the women and even attended vigils over the years marking her disappearance.

The house will be torn down, it was revealed last week.
