Criticism: Jemima Khan, who previously supported Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, became the first of his backer's to criticise him

Jemima Khan became the first celebrity backer of Julian Assange to publicly criticise his decision to jump bail and seek refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.

She said his ‘instantaneous rock-star status’ made him feel he was ‘above the law and exempt from criticism’, even likening him to Scientologist L Ron Hubbard.

Nearly eight months after the WikiLeaks founder took up residence in the diplomatic building, Miss Khan, who put up bail money for Assange, laid bare her frustrations at his attempts to dodge extradition to Sweden where he is wanted over rape and sex assault allegations.

She gave an extraordinary insight into how Assange, whose whistleblowing website angered Washington by releasing thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010, has alienated some of his staunchest allies.

In a reference to fictional spy Jason Bourne, she said: ‘I jokingly asked if Assange was the new Jason Bourne, on the run and persecuted by the state.

‘It would be a tragedy if a man who has done so much good were to end up tolerating only disciples and unwavering devotion, more like an Australian L Ron Hubbard.’

Miss Khan, 39, described how she had previously supported Assange - even after he was arrested over the claims in late 2010.

But the socialite and former wife of cricket star Imran Khan now says that his female accusers have ‘human rights’, too, and that she had gone from “admiration to demoralisation” on the subject of WikiLeaks.

She said in the New Statesman: ‘The timing of the rape allegations and the issuing of the Interpol arrest warrant for Assange in November 2010 initially seemed suspicious to many, including me.

'They came just two days after the release of the first batch of embarrassing state department cables.’

Rock star status: Miss Khan referred to Assange's ‘instantaneous rock-star status’ and likened him to founding Scientologist L Ron Hubbard

She went on: ‘It may well be that the serious allegations of sexual assault and rape are not substantiated in court, but I have come to the conclusion that these are all matters for Swedish due process and that Assange is undermining both himself and his own transparency agenda – as well as doing the US department of justice a favour – by making his refusal to answer questions in Sweden into a human rights issue.

‘There have been three rounds in the UK courts and the UK courts have upheld the European Arrest Warrant in his name three times.

‘The women in question have human rights, too, and need resolution. Assange’s noble cause and his wish to avoid a US court does not trump their right to be heard in a Swedish court.

‘I don’t regret putting up bail money for Assange but I did it so that he would be released while awaiting trial, not so that he could avoid answering to the allegations.’

Asylum: Julian Assange making a speech outside the Ecuador Embassy in London where he has sought political asylum

Miss Khan did not reveal how much bail money she put up for Assange although it has previously been reported she promised as much as £20,000.

In August last year, two months after he went into hiding at the Ecuadorian Embassy, the fugitive, 41, emerged on the building’s balcony to portray himself as a martyr for free speech who faced oppression from a ‘war on whistle-blowers’.

In a rambling speech, he accused the US of a ‘witch-hunt’ that threatened freedom of expression.

Undermining: Miss Khan, who is associate editor of the New Statesman, said Assange is 'undermining both himself and his transparency agenda'

Ironically, he then thanked a roll-call of Latin American countries, most of which are routinely criticised for their appalling track record over freedom of speech and human rights.

It was the first time he had been seen in public since he walked into the embassy last June to claim asylum.

Miss Khan, who is associate editor of the New Statesmen, said: ‘The problem is that WikiLeaks – whose mission statement was “to produce . . . a more just society . . . based upon truth” – has been guilty of the same obfuscation and misinformation as those it sought to expose, while its supporters are expected to follow, unquestioningly, in blinkered, cultish devotion.’

She said that in August last year, she tried several times to ask Assange to address points about his extradition battle which had been made by a New Statesman colleague, but he snubbed each attempt.

‘I was told that Assange was “very busy”, though I was invited to visit the Ecuadorean embassy, where he had recently taken refuge to avoid extradition, for a photo opportunity, which I declined,’ she said.

‘I have seen flashes of Assange’s charm, brilliance and insightfulness – but I have also seen how instantaneous rock-star status has the power to make even the most clear-headed idealist feel that they are above the law and exempt from criticism.’

Assange was arrested in Britain in December 2010 on an extradition warrant from Sweden.

After losing a protracted legal battle to avoid extradition, which went all the way to Britain’s Supreme Court, Assange jumped bail and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London last June. He has been inside the building ever since.

In October last year, a number of Assange’s supporters were ordered to forfeit £93,500 in bail money after the WikiLeaks founder skipped bail.

Ms Khan was executive producer of a documentary film about WikiLeaks entitled “We Steal Secrets” which recently premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States.

She said the film, directed by Oscar-winning documentary maker Alex Gibney, sought to present a balanced view of the WikiLeaks story but Assange had denounced it before seeing it.
