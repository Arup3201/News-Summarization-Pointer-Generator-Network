Speaking briefly to San Diego's CBS 8 from her hospital bed, Dang, who was spending the afternoon with co-workers at the mall when approximately 15 Al-Qaeda-affiliated gunmen opened fire, said that, 'I'm okay, I'm very grateful to be alive.'

However, her father Steven said today that two of his daughter's friends perished in the hail of bullets unleashed on unsuspecting shoppers at the upmarket mall.

Having required surgery on wounds to her chest, arms and legs following the terror outrage that has killed at least 62 people and injured over 170 more, including five Americans, Dang added that, 'I'm also very grateful or the Kenyan people, everyone was so helpful and supportive.'

Dang works for Eat Out Kenya and a photograph that she posted to Twitter yesterday shows her in her hosptial room in Nairobi along with the message, 'Proof that I am Ok - hanging out with some of my best friends in Nairobi'.

Using her Instagram account, Dang offered up heart-felt messages of thanks to her friends and family following her survival from the terror outrage, which according to Kenyan sources, could have been perpetrated by up to 15 terrorists, including three possible American citizens.

'I am overwhelmed by all of the love and support from friends, family and professors!' wrote Dang.

'I will be OK, but please send your thoughts to so many injured, still held hostage. This incident has shown me people are amazing and in moments of true chaos - the impossible can happen.'

Having seen her photographed as one of dozens of stunned and shocked survivors outside the mall following the shooting, Dang's father spoke to media outside his home to update them on his daughter's progress.

Steven Dang told 10News he believes his daughter Elaine Dang suffered injuries to her chest, arm and leg.

'The chest … something metal came in her chest and then the arm and the leg,' he said.

Dang, 26, graduated from Torrey Pines High School. According to a LinkedIn profile in her name, she went on to UC Berkeley and then taught underperforming kids through Teach for America.

Asked what his emotions were when he first heard of his daughter being at the attack he said, 'I cried and then I'm afraid....Scary, but I'm happy right now...she do OK.'

This comes as Mohammed Ali, Chief Investigations Editor at KTN, tweeted a picture of people that may be the attackers. It is CCTV footage of two men, carrying guns. They are not in army fatigues.

If indeed it is the terrorists, it is one of the first images of the deadly attack and carries haunting echoes of the terror attack carried out in Mumbai in 2008, which left over 160 dead and injured more than 600 people.

Kenya’s Chief of Defence Forces, General Julius Karangi, said fighters from several countries had participated in the attack, but would not specify which ones.

‘We have an idea who they are, their nationality and even the number,’ he said, adding that the militants were ‘clearly a multinational collection from all over the world’.

‘We have also have an idea that this is not a local event,’ he said. ‘We are fighting global terrorism here and we have sufficient [intelligence] to suggest that.’
