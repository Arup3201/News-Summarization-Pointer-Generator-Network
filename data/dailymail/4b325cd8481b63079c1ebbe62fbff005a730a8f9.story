Lord Laird has referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs over his contact with a fake lobbying company

Westminster's new ‘cash for questions’ row deepened last night after a second politician admitted being caught up in the sting that forced Tory MP Patrick Mercer to resign the party whip.

Ulster Unionist peer Lord Laird confirmed that he had been approached by two BBC journalists posing as consultants for fictitious consultancy firm Alistair Andrews Communications.

The Mail on Sunday understands he will feature with Mr Mercer in a Panorama exposé due to be broadcast this week.

The former PR executive insisted he had not broken any rules because he had never agreed to act on the fake consultancy’s behalf, nor accepted any money.

But Lord Laird revealed he had referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs and to Black Rod, the House’s senior official. 

Lord Laird said last night: ‘In recent days, I have been the subject of a scam operated by journalists masquerading as communications consultants. 

‘This has led to allegations that I have broken the rules of the House of Lords.

'I wish to make it clear that I did not agree that I would act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services to the Society of Friends of Fiji.

‘I do not believe that I have broken any rules.

‘However, I have referred myself to Black Rod’s office and to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards, and I will be making no further statement until I have received their ruling.’

Mr Mercer, a former Tory frontbencher, resigned the party whip last week after he was accused of taking £4,000 to lobby and ask parliamentary questions on behalf of Fiji.

The MP for Newark is also accused of agreeing to provide a parliamentary pass for a fictional member of the Fijian government.

Mr Mercer said he was taking legal advice on the allegations but had resigned the whip ‘to save my party embarrassment’.

He announced he would stand down at the next Election but is facing pressure from Tory colleagues to quit now – even though a by-election could mean losing a rock-solid seat to UKIP.

The row has led to fresh calls on David Cameron to introduce a ‘right of recall’ allowing voters to sack misbehaving MPs and to set up an official register of lobbyists.
