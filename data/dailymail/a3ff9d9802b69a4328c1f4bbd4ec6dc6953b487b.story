A fundraising page started to support the grieving family of a Gold Coast man who died protecting his wife and children during a lightning storm has raised $26,000 overnight, as strangers and friends alike pay tribute to the 'devoted' father of two.

Kane Bennett, 39, was killed on Saturday after he, along with his wife Mary Mourgelas, their 22-month-old son Max and 12-week-old daughter Bella, were all hit by lightning during an electrical storm in Worongary.

The family had taken shelter in a gazebo after voting in the Queensland election when the lightning struck, killing Mr Bennett, who took the impact of the blow to protect his two young children and partner of 19 years.

He was pronounced dead several hours later after being rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital, while Ms Mourgelas and her two children were released with minor injuries.

Friends and family of the Bennett's reflected on the loss of Mr Bennett, labelling him a loving father and devoted husband who thrived when he was with his loved ones.

'Kane was truly devoted to Mary. They had been together for 19 years after meeting in 1996 and had just celebrated their nine-year wedding anniversary,' said a family spokesperson.

'The couple travelled extensively before settling down to have their family. When Kane was with Mary and his kids he was at his happiest. His pride and love for his family was clear for all to see.'

A crowdfunding page, set up on Monday, to support Ms Mourgelas, Max, and Bella, said that 'Kane's final act was to ensure that he took the full force of the lightning storm so that his family was safe.'

'This page is to raise funds to support Mary, Max and Bella as they grieve the loss of a wonderful husband and Dad.'

The page was initially set up with the goal of raising $10,000, but has surpassed expectations, raising over $26,000 in less than 24 hours.

Family friend Steph Julian set up the crowdfunding page to help ease the financial burden of Mr Bennett's death.

'Kane was in the middle of renovating their house when he passed away,' Ms Julian told AAP.

'So Mary's brought babies home to no kitchen cupboards and a half-finished cubby house.'

The donations, along with messages of sympathy, have flooded in to the page, ranging from pledges of $10 to $3000.  

'I don't know you Mary, but your family has been in my thoughts since I heard of this terrible tragedy. I am so sorry for your loss - my heart goes out to you and your beautiful children,' said one donor.

'I am sure you are so proud of your husband and I know he will be looking out for you from above,' said another.

A statement from the family released through Queensland Police detailed Mr Bennett's active service in East Timor with the Australian Defense Force between 1994 and 2004, including peace-keeping missions, reported The Brisbane Times.

The statement also revealed Mr Bennett's generous heart and passion for helping youth during his career as a social worker and educator.

'Kane thoroughly enjoyed motivating young people and helping to build confidence in those who lacked it'.

Mr Bennett was involved with the Get Set For Work Programme on the Gold Coast for at-risk youth, and also worked with the  Cerebal Palsy League, before working with Charlton Brown in Brisbane.

The 39-year-old worked to help train students to gain disability support and community service qualifications.

The loss of the father of two resounded with many who donated, and one called his death 'a tragic loss of a beautiful man'. 

'Its just so unbelievable. My thoughts and prayers are with you at this awful time,' said a donor.

'It is very clear that not only have you lost your soulmate, but the world has lost a very kind and generous soul,' said another.

Ms Mourgelas said through the statement that she had been touched by the support the Gold Coast community had shown her and her young family.

'Mary knows that much of the Gold Coast, especially those who witnessed the accident at Worongary on Saturday, have been expressing their grief and she has been truly touched by their actions,' the statement said.

'She wants to thank the local community and the media for their respect for the family’s privacy and expressed wishes for this to continue.'
