Patricia Parris was awarded a six-figure pay-out when her son tried to hang himself - but did not declare it

A mother handed a £112,500 payout for her son's injuries after he tried to hang himself while on remand has been convicted of benefit fraud.

Patricia Parris received the compensation as a trustee for her son who died just weeks after receiving the money.

Her son Robert, 23, suffered serious brain damage after he tried to hang himself at Glen Parva detention centre's healthcare unit, Leicestershire, in October 1999.

He had been referred to the unit because of concerns about self-harm.

The Home Office was sued through his mother, of Radford, Nottingham and the case centred on what preventative steps medics could have taken.

Despite the Home Office denying liability, a judge approved the settlement, and the money went to his mother when he died.

Mother-of-three Parris was claiming income support, housing benefit and Job Seeker’s Allowance legitimately, but after receiving the compensation she did not declare it.

Nottingham Crown Court heard she had claimed to the benefit authorities that, after expenses, she had only £10,000 of the cash left.

But they delved deeper into her finances, finding she had invested her full ISA allowance and bought an annuity with £58,000.

She unlawfully pocketed £47,591.65 in benefits over seven years.

The 50-year-old admitted not informing
Department of Work and Pensions or Nottingham City Council about the 
capital, which would have affected benefits claims.

Her barrister, Gregor Purcell, said it was an exceptional case and she had not been properly advised regarding her investments.

If she had put the money into a discretionary trust for her children, she could have claimed the benefit.

'This isn’t a case that merits a custodial sentence,' said Mr Purcell.

'She has repaid all she can. She is almost penniless and without a home. In my submission, she has been punished enough.

'She will continue to repay the money by direct debit from her bank account. Whatever money she had has been taken from her.

'Had she put the money in a trust, legally removing her entitlement to it, she would have got the benefit.

'She was advised by the bank.

'She may have thought she could do that while still receiving those benefits.'

He said Parris visited her son in a nursing home everyday for five years as he lay in a vegetative state.

She wiped away tears as Recorder Adrian Redgrave QC gave her a probation supervision for six months.

He said: 'It's quite apparent that you have had far more than your fair share of tragedy over the years.'
