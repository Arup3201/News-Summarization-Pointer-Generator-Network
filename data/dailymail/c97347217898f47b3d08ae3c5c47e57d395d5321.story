A gas explosion has ripped through a crowded Syrian refugee camp in Jordan today.

The fire sent black smoke rising over the 
Zaatari refugee camp in the Jordanian city of 
Mafraq, near the border with Syria.

Authorities said the blaze damaged 35 tents but did not result in any death or injuries.

In December, the U.N. said around one million Syrians have registered as refugees in
neighboring Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt since the uprising against President Bashir Assad began two years ago.

Since December the exodus has picked up, with some 7,000 fleeing Syria every day.

Several 
hundred thousand more have fled the country but haven't signed up with the 
U.N. refugee agency.

Most are living in camps. Zaatari, one of Jordan's largest, is home to some 120,000 people.

Refugees have been struggling with 
harsh desert conditions, including cold and floods in the winter, and 
scorching heat, along with snakes and scorpions, in the summer.

in December, several dozen refugees rioted 
in Zaatari early, destroying 
tents and medicine and leaving scores of refugee families out in the 
night cold.

Jordanian men also are moving the 
other way across the border - joining what intelligence officials have 
estimated to be around 2,000 foreigners fighting alongside Syrian rebels
trying to topple Assad.

In one incident, a Jordanian border guard was wounded after 
armed men exchanged gunfire at the northern frontier.

In response to the crisis, Turkey
has reinforced its border with artillery guns and deployed more fighter
jets to an air base close to the border region.

It followed an errant Syrian 
mortar shell killed five people in a Turkish border town last year and 
Turkey retaliated with artillery strikes.
