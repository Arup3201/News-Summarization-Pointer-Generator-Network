A Texas father has been reunited with his family after he was wrongly accused of abusing his baby daughter, but it turned out she has a rare bone disease that causes her fragile bones to break.

Andrew Huber was changing little Kenley's diaper in August 2012 when he heard a pop. He and his wife Bria Huber rushed the child to a Dallas hospital where doctors discovered she had a broken leg, but also noticed other broken bones and Mr Huber was eventually arrested for child abuse.

Both parents were in shock.

Wrongly accused: Andrew Huber, right, was arrested after breaking his and wife Bria's daughter Kenley's leg in August 2012 while changing her diaper

Rare disease: But it turned out Kenley, pictured left, has a rare bone disease that causes her fragile bones to break. Finally, Mr Huber, pictured right in his mug shot, was cleared

'Halfway through my police interview, they told me that they believed that Andrew had been systematically abusing Kenley and her fractures were at varying stages of healing,' Mrs Huber told KHOU.com. 'I had been married to this monster that I never met.'

But this conclusion just didn't make sense, particularly as Kenley's pediatrician had never seen any problems and the family's nanny reported seeing no signs of abuse.

'I had to step back and intellectualize and say could this have even happened,' Mrs Huber said. 'Let me not be blinded by my love but let me go through and make sure I'm doing everything to protect our daughter.'

Confused: Mrs Huber, right, didn't believe that her husband, left, was a monster when police told her of the alleged abuse

Sad: Mr Huber was kept away from his daughter, Kenley, for 14 months while police investigated why her bones were breaking

So while Mr Huber was in and out of court, she took Kenley to specialists across the United States, searching for answers.

Eventually, the family came across another mother named Rana Tyson whose twin girls had been removed from her until a geneticist named Dr. Golder Wilson diagnosed them with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or EDS.

'One of the main symptoms is the underlying structure of the body, including the bones and joints, is fragile. So you get more fractures,' Dr. Wilson told KHOU.

Relief: Now the family is all back together after the diagnosis

'And therefore, just handling a baby routinely, like any parent would do, can lead to a fracture.'

Kenley and Mrs Huber were both diagnosed with EDS, though the mother said she had never heard of the disease.

Thankfully, the discovery also set Mr Huber free, after more than a year spent away from his wife and daughter.

'Right now it's just a joy to be back home and have the house,' Mr Huber said. 'That's far outweighing the anger. The happiness to have my girls back.'
