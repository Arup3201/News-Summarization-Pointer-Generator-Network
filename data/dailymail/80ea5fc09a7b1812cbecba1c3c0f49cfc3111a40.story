BBC Rogue Traders presenter Dan 
Penteado faces jail after pleading guilty today to benefit fraud to the tune of £24,000.

Penteado, 40, who co-hosts the 
programme with Matt Allwright, admitted eight offences of dishonestly or
knowingly claiming council tax and housing benefit while not declaring he earned thousands
from the BBC for the show.

Penteado, from Bournemouth, was granted bail while a pre-sentence report is prepared.

The case was adjourned until July 17 at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court.

Kerry O'Neill, prosecuting, said the 
offences went back to 2007 when Penteado filled out his first claim form
and failed to declare he had another bank account.

The court heard that Penteado repeated the fraud in subsequent years up to 2011.

In that time he failed to tell 
Bournemouth Borough Council he had been paid more than £56,000 for his 
work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011.

Miss O'Neill said: 'On the 17 October 2007 the defendant completed a housing 
benefit and a council tax benefit application form and on that 
particular form he failed to disclose that he had another bank account 
with Nationwide.

'On 1 March 2008 he again signed further forms verifying and clarifying that he didn’t have other bank accounts.

'On 14 January 2009 he signed another verification form stating that 
information until this date was true and accurate. It was not true as he
had failed to disclose the Nationwide bank account.'

Miss O’Neill told the court that in 2008 the council became aware that 
Penteado had received more than £16,000 from the BBC but had 
failed to let them know.

She said: 'Between 16 April 2008 and 15 September 2008 it became known 
to the borough council that the defendant received £16,551.30 from
the BBC but the defendant failed to disclose this information to the 
borough council.'

Penteado continued to fail to tell the council about payments from the 
BBC while still completing forms for housing and council tax benefit.

Between 24 July 2009 and 1 May 2010 Penteado received £15,605.27 for his work on Rogue Traders.

He received an additional £18,016.92 from the 2 July 2010 until 7 January 2011.

Miss O’Neill said: 'On the 28 May 2010 the defendant completed a 
verification form for housing and council tax benefit application, on 
this form he failed to disclose that he had been receiving payment from 
the BBC or that he had contracts for them.'

He also received £6,259.50 between 4 May 2011 and 2 September 2011 but failed to notify the council.

As a result Penteado received £24,077.60 of housing and council tax benefit that he wasn’t entitled to.

Miss O’Neill said: 'Since March 2012 three payments of £70 have been paid back in respect of the sum owed. That leaves the outstanding sum of housing benefit and council tax benefit which he is not entitled to as $23,867.60.'

The court heard the council, which 
brought the prosecution, would be seeking to recover all the cash.

No mitigation was put put forward by his solicitor, Terrence Scanlan, at the hearing.

The Portuguese-born presenter, who 
was wearing a white shirt, black tie, black trousers and a black jumper 
and carrying a black biker jacket, left court without comment.

He started working with Mr Allwright in 2001.

He is familiar to viewers of Watchdog as 
one half of the motorbike-riding team of investigators who chase down 
unscrupulous tradesmen and bring them to justice.

In the last series of Watchdog, the pair confronted eight business owners who they felt were ripping off the public.

Earlier this month it was reported that he had failed to respond to letters of inquiry sent to him by Bournemouth Council.

As a result he was sent a court 
summons to appear before magistrates but he failed to show up and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

It is understood Penteado handed himself in on June 14.

At the time he said: 'It’s all a 
misunderstanding that’s causing a lot of grief for my family. There is 
no arrest warrant. I’ve been to the police station and I’ve not been 
arrested.'
