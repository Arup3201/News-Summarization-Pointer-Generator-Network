It was one catch this hungry white tiger was not going to let get away. 

The rare beast springs out of out of the water before devouring his dinner.

Having caught the airborne chicken, the great predator lands with a satisfied splash,

These stunning photographs were taken by Singapore photographer Manoj Kumar Tuteja, 26, at the Singapore Zoo during evening feeding time.

'I had the privilege of standing at the right spot when it was time for feeding,' says Manoj.

'It's the strength of the white tiger which is attractive, and seeing just how high it can jump is spectacular.

'The way he opens his jaws so aggressively to catch the meat is amazing to watch.'

With two adult tigers being fed at the same time, this hungry big cat made his way from land to the water to find the best position to catch his dinner.

Standing only around 30 feet away from the animals, Manoj patiently watched the tigers for twenty minutes before feeding time began.

The hungry tiger keeps a careful eye firmly on its meal - the animals are fed by keepers  every evening

The photographer was stunned at how high the great predators could leap to catch their dinner

Manoj says: 'All these shots have been taken instantly, as there is no scope for trial and error when it comes to feeding time in the tiger enclosure.

'The keepers throw the meat into the open enclosure and, since they are only fed once a day, this is your only chance to catch the action.'

Singapore Zoo spans 69 acres and features 315 species of animal, including the white tiger.

The tigers' eye-catching pale colouration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pigments that normally produce the orange colour

The white tiger is a rare variant of the Bengal tiger and is found in grasslands and forests of South Asia and some parts of India.

Its eye-catching pale colouration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pigments that normally produce the orange colour.

However, they still produce the pigment, and so are not considered to be albino.
