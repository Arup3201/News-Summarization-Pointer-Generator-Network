A hospital chief executive on a £170,000 salary, who dressed as Superman to impress his staff, spent £50,000 on his NHS credit card over a three-year period, it has emerged.

Phil Morley made the headlines last year when he dressed as Superman and sent a cringeworthy video of him dancing around a hospital to his staff to boost morale.

Dubbed the 'real life David Brent' due to the video, Phil Morley’s credit card statements show he has spent £50,000 of tax payers’ money on fine dining and luxury hotel stays during his time as chief executive of Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

In 2012, he even spent £4,454.31 on hotels and car hire during a controversial trip to Florida with fellow hospital bosses Jayne Adamson Amanda Pye - which even included a sunset cruise on a luxury yacht.

The former hospital boss frittered £50,000 on his NHS card at a time when staff at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital were under intense pressure to make savings of £95m.

His statement shows he paid £817.50 to stay at the five-star Royal Horseguards Hotel in London and £1,284.05 to stay at the four-star Montague in London as well as a Greggs bakery bill for £17.88.

Interim chief executive John Saxby who has taken over from Phil Morley after he resigned in April, has ordered staff to hand back their cards and has condemned the way staff have been spending.

John Saxby said: 'Almost all of the cards have been withdrawn and we will end up with two, one held by IT and one held as a corporate card for when tickets need to be bought for, say, someone travelling to London.'

John Saxby, who does not hold an NHS credit card, said the trust had been 'less than careful' about signing off credit card purchases but rules had now been tightened up and staff have been asked to stop travelling first class and to use budget hotels if staying overnight on NHS business.

John said: 'My rule of thumb is Travelodge.

'I want people to restrict themselves to spending no more than it would cost in Travelodge.

'All I’m asking is for people to be sensible, as this is public money at the end of the day. I encourage staff to think, if they could do it cheaper, then that’s what they should do.'

Bumbling 'Superman' boss Phil Morley joined the trust in October 2010 and he rejected a salary of £190,000, claiming it was 'too high'- taking home a £170,000 salary instead.

However, his NHS credit card was used to pay for meals at some of East Yorkshire’s finest restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Pipe and Glass in South Dalton.

Following his resignation in April, £1,343.23 was refunded to the credit card after a booking on getaroom.com made on March 8 was cancelled, Mr Morley's interim replacement John Saxby does not use an NHS card

While Mr Morley left the trust in April, his credit card shows a refund in the May statement of £1,343.23 from getaroom.com, relating to a booking made on March 8 this year.

In 2011, his credit card was used to pay for hotel bills of £3,898.20, and £1,605.14 on restaurant bills, including ten visits to the Mill House in Skidby.

His credit card was also used to pay for £281.43 of shopping at Waitrose and his overall bill for his first year as chief executive was £6,376.02.

Morley’s credit card was also used to pay online retailer Amazon £495.05, including a £14.50 digital download.

Last year, Phil Morley’s credit card was used to foot hotel bills of £6,818.49, including the stay at the Royal Horseguards Hotel.

John Saxby said: 'There are lots of NHS organisations that use credit cards but we didn’t have credit cards in my last two organisations. I have never had a credit card and that is a moral position you take.

'For some reason, a number of credit cards were approved for use by people.. Most of them had pretty small amounts of money on them. In some cases, it was to do with purchasing around IT.

'People had been less than careful about the signing off. That has now been introduced. I just think too many had been issued. My advice is we do need to be careful about how this is perceived.'

John Saxby said credit cards had been used in the past to make it 'quicker and easier' for staff to purchase goods, including software for tablets and educational courses at external venues.

He pointed out although credit cards had been used to pay restaurant bills, the cost was claimed back from professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians, and did not come out of the NHS or trust budgets in 'many instances'.

He said: 'It is not possible for me to comment on why my predecessor paid for certain items with a credit card.

'What I am clear about, however, is my view that we should not be using credit cards unless it is absolutely necessary and we have taken steps to significantly reduce the number of cards the trust holds.

'Furthermore, when we are spending public money and using credit cards, we must take every step possible to ensure we are getting the best value for money.

'Our processes are far more robust now than they were previously. All chief executive spending is now countersigned by the chairman and chief finance officer.'

Mr Morley said his £190,000 proposed salary when he joined in October 2010 was too high and cut it by £20,000, however he used his NHS credit card to eat in five star hotels and Michelin star restaurants 

The trust said Mr Morley has given assurance to auditors that his credit card was used for legitimate expenses.

Phil Morley was approached about the transactions but declined to comment.

Ray Gray, regional officer of trade union Unison, said he was alarmed by the amount of money spent on all the trust credit cards.

He said: 'I think the amount spent on hospitality is ridiculous.

'Staff are struggling to pay their own bills when they go to the supermarkets and I can’t see them being happy about this.'

Mr Gray said reducing the amount of people holding trust credit cards was 'the right way forward'.

Andy Silvester, from the Tax Payers’ Alliance, said: 'This is a disgrace, and taxpayers will be outraged.

'Money doesn’t grow on trees, and every penny frittered away on swanky meals and upmarket hotels is a penny that can’t be spent on doctors and nurses.

'Mr Morley - and the NHS officials who signed off the spending - have serious questions to answer.'
