Prehistoric hunters in Greenland lived through a 'Meteorite Age' where they mined metal from fallen space rocks to make weapons, according to archaeologists.

Danish researchers have found evidence that suggests ancient cultures in Greenland were making tools from a meteorite they found on the ice more than 1,200 years ago.

This was nearly 300 years before Norse settlers from Iceland arrived in Greenland and are thought to have brought iron with them made from ore on Earth.

With no metal naturally accessible in Greenland, the discovery suggests that the meteorite was responsible for kickstarting the Iron Age in the country and allowing the native hunters to develop new metal technology.

The meteorite is thought to have crashed into the Greenland ice sheet around the Cape York Peninsula in north west Greenland, around 10,000 years ago and split into at least eight large pieces.

Greenland is one of the largest frozen landscapes in the world, with much of the land covered with giant ice sheets.

The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC, and was repeatedly colonised by waves of immigration from the islands north of Canada.

The first Paleo=Eskimo cultures to arrive on Greenland were the Saqqaq culture, who appear to have intermittently inhabited the western reaches of the country island between 2500BC and 800BC.

Two other unique cultures, known as the Independence Cultures also arose on Greenland over the same period until the Dorest Culture arrived in 700BC.

They continued until 1300AD, although the early Inuit Thules began arriving around 1100AD.

It is thought that the Thule's take over of the trade in meteorite iron is thought to have been partly responsible for the demise of the Dorset culture.

The Norse began settling in the southern part of Greenland in around 980AD before spreading and bringing with them iron from elsewhere in Europe.

Among them was an enormous lump of iron known as Ahighito, or the Tent, which weighs around 31 tons, a 22 ton piece called The Man, a 2.5 ton chunk called the Woman and the Dog, weighing half a ton.

These are now all housed at the American Museum of Natural History after being transported there by arctic explorers in the 19th century.

However, archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark have now found evidence that the native 'Paleo-Eskimos' who lived in the area had been knocking fragments off these boulders for hundreds of years.

They found piles of basalt stones weighing up to 40kg (88lbs) that had been carried to the locations where the meteorites were found where they were used to hammer pieces off the meteorites.

The metal was then used to forge a knife or harpoon blade.

Dr Martin Appelt, an archaeologist from the National Museum of Denmark, told online magazine Polarfronten: 'We knew the locations because what we have here are large scientific objects, but the story of the meteorites as the whole area's source of iron have sunk into oblivion.'

Together with a team of archaeologists from Denmark and Greenland, Dr Appelt and his colleagues discovered huge piles of hammer stones. 

Mikkel Myrup, an archaeoloigst from the Greenland National Museum, measured the piles using a drone and estimates that they may contain up to 70 tonnes of hammer stones.

The Agpalilik fragment, also called the Man, of the meteorite now sits outside the Geological Museum in Copenhagen (seen above) but the iron rich space rock brought new material for weapons to Greenland

The 34 ton Ahnighito meteorite fragment was mined for centuries before it was moved by American polar explorer Robert Peary, seen above posing next to the meteorite in its original location, to the United States

This would suggest that huge amounts of iron had been mined from the meteorites over the years.

'They did a heck of a lot of hammering,' said Dr Jens Fog Jensen, another archaeologist involved in the research from the National Museum of Denmark.

'The blacksmiths would start by knocking off a small piece, thoroughly beating it flat and giving it a sharp edge, then hardening it further so that it could serve as an arrowhead or flensing knife.'

Analysis on iron tools from the area show that it had come from these meteorites as they have a distinctive chemical signature that includes traces of nickel.

It is through early Eskimos, also known as the Dorset people, began exploiting the iron in the meteorites in the mid eighth century. When the Thules, an early Inuit people, arrived in the 12th century, they took over the trade in meteorite iron.

Weapons made from the meteorites have been found as far away as Canada.

In southern Greenland, which was the first area to be occupied by the Norsemen, just one single fragment of the meteorite has been found.

It is thought that they had no need to use the meteorite iron as they had access to iron from terrestrial ore.

Dr Appelt added: 'It has been traded over large distances and testifies to the significance of the meteorites from the Thule as a source of iron in the Eastern Arctic.'
