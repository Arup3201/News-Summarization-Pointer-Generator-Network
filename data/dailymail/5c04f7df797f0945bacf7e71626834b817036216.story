Sir Ian Botham has told of his heartbreak at deciding to end visits to his dementia-suffering father while he was in a care home.

The former England cricketing great has opened up about losing his 'bright and clever' father Leslie to Alzheimer's in 2005 and the agony of watching his condition deteriorating.

The 58-year-old, England's leading Test wicket taker, revealed how Leslie's behaviour became increasingly 'awkward' as dementia took hold putting a huge strain on his family.

Eventually the pensioner became a patient in a care home - but the former bowler revealed he was so distressed by seeing his father ravaged by the condition that he could no longer face visiting him.

Talking to the BBC's Inside Out programme, he asked people not to 'judge' him for his decision, describing the situation as 'horrendous'.

During an emotional interview he revealed his mother was under so much strain looking after her husband that she suffered a heart attack. Leslie passed away in a care home in Somerset in December 2005 at the age of 82.

Initially Sir Ian, now a cricket commentator at Sky Sports, would visit his father with his mother but in the end he said he felt there was 'no point in going'.

'He had to be sedated to have a shower, he got violent, he lost all his bodily controls, he was totally dysfunctional and I did not want to see my dad like that,' he said.

'All I was looking at was a cavity of what was my father and I said "Mum you've got to stop going" and she said "no I can't". 

'I said "Mum, you come back, it's tearing you apart, you sit there, you're in tears he doesn't know who you are any more". 

'We would walk in and he would come up and he would have someone on his arm and he would come up and say "Are you here? Are you staying here?" 

'He would have no idea who I was or who my mum was and I said "Mum, I'm making a decision here, I've got so many great memories of my father I am not going any more".

'I said "I really wish you wouldn't because it isn't doing you any good. And I'm not going because it's destroying everything I loved about my father and I don't want to have to see him like this in this vegetable state". And I refused to go.'

Sir Ian, who has helped to raise millions of pounds for charity over the years, said that the experience of seeing his father in this state was 'horrendous' adding: 'He was fit, healthy, bright, clever, a sportsman, father, grandfather.

'He would be horrified to see himself and I wasn't prepared to keep on looking at him like that and seeing this person who did not even know who he was - so that's why I didn't go.'

Sir Ian, also known as Beefy, captured the imagination of the British public when he almost single-handedly defeated Australia in a 1981 series that later became known as 'Botham's Ashes'.

Outside cricket he has been a prolific fundraiser, undertaking 12 long-distance charity walks including from John O'Groats to Land's End.

Alzheimer's, a physical disease affecting the brain, is the most common cause of dementia. By 2015, it is predicted there will be more than 520,000 people in the UK with the condition.

People with the disease will often experience lapses in memory and have problems finding the right words.
