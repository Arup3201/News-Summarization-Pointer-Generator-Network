Australian prison authorities have reportedly moved convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika to a different Victorian prison, fearing he has been promoting extremism from jail.

Benbrika, also known as Sheik Abu Bakr, is serving a 15 year jail term after being convicted in 2009 for his role leading a terrorist group that planned to attack Melbourne's Crown casino and bomb the MCG. He was previously held in the high-security unit of Barwon Prison.

Authorities believe Benbrika has been communicating with jihadist recruits from behind bars after a number of his followers travelled to Syria to join the extremist Islamic State group after visiting him in prison,News Corp Australia reports.

It's reported Benbrika sees himself as a spiritual leader of new Australian extremists, similar to jailed Indonesian cleric Abu Baku Bashir, the 'spiritual leader' of the Bali bombers.

Convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika is believed by authorities to have been influencing jihadist recruits from prison

In 2009, Benbrika was the first person in Australia to be convicted of leading a terrorist organisation. He planned to attack Melbourne's Crown casino and bomb the MCG

Algerian-born Benbrika has been described as a self-proclaimed Islamic cleric and was previously President of the Algerian Society, which focused on assisting Algerian refugees.

He was one of 17 men arrested in Sydney and Melbourne in 2005 in one of Australia's largest counter terrorism operations, Operation Pendennis, and was the first person in Australia to be convicted of leading a terrorist organisation. 

Prosecutors alleged the group was committed to violent ‘jihad’ against those they perceived to be the enemies of Islam. During his trial, the Victorian Supreme Court heard how Benbrika instructed his followers in how to kill a person with a knife.

 'You put your hand here, like this. And you put ... a knife here, and you open. This is training. You have to learn it,' were his words to three of his followers, caught by a secret police bug in the lead up to his arrest. He added that the victim will groan 'and then you strike.'

According to News Corp, authorities are reviewing Benbrika's prison entitlements, including his access to computers and books, and the number of visitors he can receive.

It is believed about 60 Australians are fighting in Iraq and Syria with groups such as Islamic State.

Last month, Australian Police conducted dawn counter terrorism raids across Sydney and Brisbane after receiving intelligence that Islamic State supporters were planning a public execution on Australian streets.

At least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in the anti-terror raids in Sydney and Brisbane in September and 15 people were arrested. 

Last month, fifteen people were arrested when police swooped on homes across Western Sydney and South Brisbane in the largest counter terrorism raids in Australia's history. 

The raids were sparked by intelligence that Islamic State supporters were planning a public execution in Australian streets.   

'Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention, and had started to carry out planning, to commit violent acts here in Australia,' AFP Acting Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters in Sydney at the time. 'Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public,' he said. 

The plot involved abducting a member of the public in Sydney and beheading them.

One of the men arrested, Omarjan Azari, was found in Court to have conspired with a different Islamist militant, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, to carry out an attack which was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community.'

Baryalei, who had previously worked as a bouncer in Sydney’s Kings Cross nightclub district and  played a role in the Australian TV series Underbelly, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.
