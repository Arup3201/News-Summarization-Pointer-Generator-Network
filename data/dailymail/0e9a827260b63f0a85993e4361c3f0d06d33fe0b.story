Police in Tennessee are investigating whether human remains found in Decatur County woods on Sunday may be that of murdered nursing student Holly Bobo, whose body has not been found since she disappeared over three years ago.

Officials say two people out looking for ginseng came across a human skull in the area, which is 10 miles from the home of Zach Adams, one of two men charged with kidnapping and murdering the 20-year-old.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to tell whether the remains could be linked to Bobo, who was last seen on the morning of April 13, 2011, walking into woods with a man in hunting clothes near her family's home in Darden.

'This is someone’s missing loved one but at this point we don’t know who,' District Attorney Matt Stowe told WSMV.

Charged: Zachary Adams (left) and Jason Wayne Autry (right) are suspected of kidnapping and killing Bobo

Adams, 29, and Jason Autry, 39, were both charged with kidnapping and murder in the Bobo case in February.

In May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence.

Jeffrey Pearcy allegedly showed a friend cell phone footage of Bobo tied up and crying before her murder.

The friend, Sandra King, testified at a preliminary hearing in May that she saw Zachary Adams in the footage.

Mrs King also claimed that Jeffrey Pearcy told her that his brother Mark had filmed the incident.

'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court, WMC reported.

'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.'

King said it appeared the blonde in the video was about to be sexually assaulted, but she did not see.

'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has not seen the video.

Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone.

King worked with police to try and have Pearcey acknowledge the video in a phone call.

'I said to him, "You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you in that video, I would have watched it," and he said, "Yes I know",' King said.

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011

Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

Both men have pleaded not guilty.

Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder.

Autry,was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges.

TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing.

Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5.

'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.' 

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams.

Adams, was arrested and charged shortly afterwards.

Adams appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him.

Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing.

Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.
