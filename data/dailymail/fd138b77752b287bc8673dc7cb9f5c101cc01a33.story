A pair of brothers have escaped up to seven years jail after they were accused of glassing and punching a restaurant owner in Bali.

Scott and Tim O'Hehir, from Perth, are expected to touchdown in Australia on Monday after charges laid against them were dropped by restaurant owner Wayan Mudipa on the Indonesian party island.

Mr Wayan alleged he had caught the brothers urinating on his religious shrine in the first week of their three-week holiday, 9News reported.

The owner of Apa Kabar Restaurant, in North Kuta, said the brothers then attacked him.

Mr Wayan claimed Scott, 32, punched him while Tim, 27, hit him over the head with a glass bottle.

The pair then ran away but were later arrested and held in custody over the weekend.

Police said the brothers had consumed alcohol when the incident took place, 7News reported.

'I want to apologise to Mr Wayan on behalf of myself and my brother,' Scott said.

'I would also like to apologise to Mr Wayan's family, the island of Bali and the entire Indonesian archipelago for the trouble that we've caused.'

Scott and Tim were released from jail overnight on Sunday after they reached an agreement with Mr Mudipa, according to 9News.

The elder O'Hehir is a director of a Perth-based human resources company called Checkside, while the younger O'Hehir is a dentist who works in Singapore, The West Australian reported.
