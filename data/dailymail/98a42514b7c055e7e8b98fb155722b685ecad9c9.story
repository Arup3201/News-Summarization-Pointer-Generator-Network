A fake charity worker who toured pubs dressed as a clown has been exposed as an unemployed conman.

Colin Smith put on the fancy dress outfit, including a multi-coloured wig and red nose, and claimed to be collecting money in aid of cystic fibrosis victims.

But when a landlord grew suspicious of the clown's 'scruffy' outfit, he called the police - and it soon emerged that Smith could not even remember which charity he was supposed to be collecting for.

The fraudster has now been sentenced to a 12-month community order at Bury Magistrates' Court, and will have to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Busted: Colin Smith was arrested while claiming to collect money for charity dressed as a clown

Smith, 52, travelled 40 miles from his home in Liverpool last month to the Roebuck Hotel in Rochdale, where he asked landlord Anthony Dearden if he could carry out a collection in the bar for cystic fibrosis.

Mr Dearden agreed, but when he asked the man for photographic identification Smith was only able to produce a handwritten Red Nose Day form.

The landlord asked Smith to leave, and radioed town centre security warning other business owners to be careful of the bogus charity worker.

Mr Dearden told magistrates: 'A gentleman came through the door dressed as a clown carrying a bucket.

'I asked him what he was collecting for, and he said cystic fibrosis. He was dressed as a clown, but he looked really scruffy.

'He didn't seem to me like he was doing it with any enthusiasm, like he meant it. He didn't look like somebody who wanted to be collecting for charity.'

Punishment: The serial fraudster was handed a community order and sentenced to unpaid work

Police arrested Smith in the Rochdale town centre, and in a subsequent interview he insisted he never said he was collecting for cystic fibrosis and was in fact seeking donations for Red Nose Day - which took place in March.

'I can't remember saying I was collecting for cystic fibrosis, but it had been a long day - I may have said it,' he told officers. 'I have collected for cystic fibrosis before and raised money for them.'

Prosecutor Karen Saffman asked jobless Smith why he did not have time to collect money on Red Nose Day itself, and questioned why he had spent such a large chunk of his Â£78-per-week in benefits on a train ticket to Rochdale.

He said: 'I was going to collect money for Comic Relief - I was going to do it for a whole week across the North-West but this put the kibosh on it.

'If I walked out of my house dressed as a clown, I'd get attacked by the kids where I live.'

Defending, Jeremy Hawthorn retorted: 'There are people who go up Mount Kilimanjaro for Cancer Relief - well, that's an awfully long way from home. Why can't they go up Scafell Pike?'

It emerged during the trial that Smith had a series of similar convictions between 1996 and 2006 for fraud, which involved the forging of documents and fake collections in the name of cystic fibrosis.

Smith was found guilty of being in possession of articles for use in fraud - namely a clown suit, collection bucket and charity collection form.

Inspector Umer Khan said: 'This man has tried to abuse the trust and generosity of the town centre businesses and visitors for his personal gain.

'I hope this conviction will cause him to reflect and learn from his wrongdoing.'
