Wen Ruchun, the secretive daughter of former Chinese PM Wen Jiabao, is said to be behind a £3.7m endowment to Cambridge University

One of China's most senior political families is bankrolling a professorship at Cambridge, despite the university denying any link with the country's government, it was claimed today.

Wen Ruchun, daughter of China's former prime minister Wen Jiabao, is said to be behind a £3.7million endowment from the secretive Chong Hua Foundation that funded Cambridge University's Professor in Chinese Development.

Cambridge has always denied any links between the post and Beijing, saying only that the foundation was set up by two wealthy individuals who wished to remain anonymous.

But the university now faces claims that China is buying influence at the world famous university after a new report suggests that the foundation is run by Ms Wen.

The new claims come from a previously unpublished interview with Chinese businesswoman Vivien Wang, founder of the EtonKids nursery chain, in which she made a link between Ms Wen and the Chong Hua Foundation.

Discussing giving a 29 per cent stake in her business to Miss Wen, the Beijing entrepreneur said: 'We gave the shares to her charity organisation.  The charity Chong Hua owns the shares', the Daily Telegraph reported.

If the claims are correct, the suggestion that a powerful political family in China might have bought influence at Cambridge will raise concerns.

One academic told the Telegraph that it seemed as if a foreign government had appointed a professor at Cambridge.

They said: 'How,
 if the foundation's money came from the family of the head of 
government of the People's Republic of China for over a decade, and if 
the foundation was able to name the first occupant of the chair, can 
Cambridge demonstrate academic independence?'

The professorship is currently filled by Professor Peter Nolan, who is well-known to the Wen family and who has held the post since it was created in 2012.

An international authority on China, Professor Nolan has co-written a book on China with Ms Wen's husband, Liu Chunhang, and is said to have acted as a tutor to Ms Wen.  He is said to have identified the foundation as a possible sponsor for the post.

Ms Wen belongs to China's ruling elite, 
and her family is known for its wealth and power, though she is so 
secretive, she has been described as 'Wen Jiabao's mysterious daughter'.

Ruling elite: Ms Wen's father, Wen Jiabao, was China's Prime Minister for a decade and is known for his wealth

She studied at Harvard and the University of Delaware in the United States, before working on New York's Wall Street using the pseudonym, Lily Chang.  She then moved to the UK when her husband began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, where, it is said, she was tutored by Professor Nolan.

Her father was China's Prime Minister for a decade until March last year, while her mother, Zhang Peili, is a jewellery expert and leading figure in the lucrative diamond trade.

When the professorship was created in January 2012, Cambridge University said that the endowment had come from the Chong Hua Foundation which was registered to a trust in Bermuda.

The foundation has no website, and trusts registered in Bermuda are legally able to keep their details private.

The new report raises questions over whether China can be accused of trying to buy influence in academia

Today, however, Professor Nolan declined to speak to MailOnline, while his university insisted that the donation - which some suggested might threaten the university's academic independence - was above board.

A
 Cambridge University spokesman said: 'The donation from the Chong Hua Foundation was fully 
verified and approved by the University of Cambridge Advisory Committee 
on Benefactions.

'No more details will be released as the donors, as is common practice, have requested complete anonymity.'

This afternoon the subject of China's 'intrusions' into English-speaking universities was the subject for discussion at London think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society.
