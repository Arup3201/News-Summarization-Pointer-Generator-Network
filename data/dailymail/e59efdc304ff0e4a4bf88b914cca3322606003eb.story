A man who had his ten-stone testicles removed says he is looking for love after getting his life back.

Wesley Warren Jr, 48, carried his swollen scrotum around for five years until four surgeons spent 13 hours removing the mass in April.

He had to wear a hooded top on his legs instead of trousers to accommodate his testicles, could not work, and struggled to walk or drive.

Wesley Warren Jr's operation to remove his ten-stone testicles has left him hopeful that he will find love one day

His penis was buried so deeply within his groin that he had to urinate on himself instead of going to the toilet normally and could not enjoy a fulfilling sex life.

Now, Mr Warren, from Las Vegas, says a romantic relationship could help him be happy again.

'I cannot express how ecstatic I’m feeling about the future,' he told the Sunday Mirror.

'And if some way somehow or another I can stumble upon love – any kind of love – I think I will finally be happy.

'I’m very thankful that I’ve been given my life back.'

Mr Warren could only sit down with a milk crate between his legs after his scrotum swelled up, and said he missed simple everyday activities, such as going to the supermarket and post office.

He had accidentally squashed his testicles getting out of bed, but antibiotics failed to make them return to their normal size.

Doctors diagnosed him with scrotal lymphoedema, a severe build-up of fluid.

The extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and south-east Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world.

Mr Warren was so desperate to escape the 'freak show' his life became that he considered auctioning his enormous testicle sac on eBay to raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for complicated surgery.

The 48-year-old bachelor from Las Vegas had his surgery two months ago and was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary

He raised about $2,000 in donations after appearing on U.S. television, but social security officials stepped in and stopped his benefits.

The testicles were getting heavier by the day and Mr Warren's health was deteriorating and he feared he could die on the operating table.

Then Californian consultant Dr Joel Gelman offered to perform the procedure free of charge as long as Nevada's Medicaid system covered the cost of using a hospital theatre.

He boasted that he had never lost a patient or testicle in similar operations.

'There are a lot of shows about makeovers, but this is a real makeover,' said Dr Gelman, the head of the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the University of California.

'He's basically a new man.'

The operation, which saw 132.5lb of tissue cut away from Mr Warren's groin, was filmed for Channel 4's Bodyshock series and will be shown in Britain tomorrow night.

Mr Warren could not wear trousers, instead using the arms of a hooded top to cover his legs and zipping the body over his scrotum

Doctors rebuilt his genitals with skin grafts. But Mr Warren was unhappy that he was left with an inch-long penis instead of returning to what he had before his illness.

He told the Sun: 'I do feel a great sense of comfort that the weight is no longer between my legs. It got to the point that it was a danger to my health.

'But when I look down at what’s here now it’s not the same as what it was. It’s totally different.

'My natural look prior to the growth is not what came out of surgery. What came out of surgery is a nub an inch long and it doesn’t get any larger.'

Mr Warren will have another operation later this year, and said he hopes to be loved again one day when he has recovered from his ordeal.
