Curriculum reform: Michael Gove will drop large parts of the EU from the classroom

Michael Gove yesterday dropped the European Union from the school curriculum – as EU laws were blamed for helping to sink his flagship plans to scrap GCSEs.

Pupils will no longer be required to learn about the organisation in geography lessons while citizenship classes will merely specify studying the UK’s ‘relations with the rest of Europe’.

The move is part of the Education Secretary’s far-reaching overhaul of the curriculum for primary and secondary schools aimed at restoring knowledge and rigour and reversing a trend for politically-correct causes to creep into lessons.

Youngsters will study a broad sweep of history, leave primary school with a basic mastery of grammar and learn all their times tables by the age of nine.

But on a day of major education announcements, Mr Gove was forced to abandon his plans to replace GCSEs in key subjects with tough English Baccalaureate Certificates.

He admitted that a key plank – allowing just one exam board to set tests in each subject – was currently unworkable.

Fears the move would fall foul of EU procurement laws are said to have played a part in Mr Gove’s decision to shelve the changes, as he was said to have been reluctant to become mired in legal wrangling.

While the name GCSE will remain, many of his other changes remain intact, including toughening up the exams, scrapping bite-sized modules and minimising coursework and internal assessment.

As Mr Gove told the Commons his reforms had gone a ‘bridge too far’ and he had ‘cut his losses’, it emerged his proposed new geography curriculum for secondary schools would no longer require pupils to learn about the EU.

Labour’s 2007 curriculum required pupils to study ‘different parts of the world in their wider settings and contexts, including the European Union’, and the impact of enlarging the EU on large-scale migration.

Lesson plans for citizenship classes included ‘UK’s relations with the European Union and the rest of Europe’.

However, Eurosceptic Mr Gove’s new curriculum says simply ‘relations with the rest of Europe’.

Last night a Department for Education source said: ‘The EU is a political and economic entity rather than a geographical phenomenon, so we and our expert group agreed that teaching about it should not be specified in the geography programmes of study.’

Mr Gove said the revamped GCSEs would be introduced in key subjects in September 2015 with the first exams being taken in 2017.

League tables will be overhauled so they no longer rank schools according to the proportion of pupils achieving five A* to C grades, amid concerns that teachers are encouraged to concentrate on pupils on the D/C borderline.

In a further reform, every year a random sample of pupils will be given tests in an attempt to gauge whether national standards are rising or falling.

Meanwhile the new curriculum is intended to give every pupil a bank of core knowledge and replace what Mr Gove described as the ‘vapid happy talk’ in the current documents.

It will be compulsory only in schools maintained by local authorities.

The failure of comprehensives to give pupils a grounding in a core of traditional subjects – exposed in new Government figures – lies behind Mr Gove’s reforms.

At A-level, about a quarter of state schools and colleges – more than 500 – failed to equip a single pupil with top grades in three academic disciplines last summer.

And at GCSE, just 23 per cent of state school pupils were even given the chance to sit GCSEs in six academic subjects, and even fewer – 16 per cent – gained C-grade passes in them all.

In a powerful speech this week, Mr Gove said his ‘English Baccalaureate’ league table measure – the percentage of pupils achieving Cs or better in six academic GCSEs – had shown ‘how poorly served so many state students were’.

‘Just six GCSEs. At C. A pass you can secure in some papers with just 30 per cent of the questions correct,’ he said.

Criticising a ‘lack of ambition’, he lamented that just a quarter of secondaries – 766 – responded to a Government initiative which enabled them to send pupils to visit a top university.

He said the education establishment had reacted with ‘visceral horror’ to attempts to promote traditional subjects, branding them ‘elitist’ and ‘backward-looking’, even though parents paying for private schools demanded these subjects as a right.

Poorer pupils were being denied opportunities open to a privileged elite, he warned.

A memo from Mr Gove’s department to the Commons select committee defending his plans to replace GCSEs in core subjects said many of the world’s highest performing countries insisted on a core of academic disciplines until pupils reached 16.

It said the goal was to provide ‘students with the level of knowledge and skills expected in the highest-performing jurisdictions’.
