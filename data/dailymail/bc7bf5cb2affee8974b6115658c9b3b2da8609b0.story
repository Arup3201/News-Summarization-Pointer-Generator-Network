Charles Dickens's classic novel A Christmas Carol is the book that parents want their children to read more than any other.

Other selections that would please mothers and fathers were JK Rowling's Harry Potter books and JRR Tolkien's timeless The Lord of the Rings trilogy, a survey by the University of Worcester revealed.

One in five parents and guardians would be happiest if their child chose to read Dickens's Victorian tale, with the more modern series following in second and third places.

Iconic romance novelist Jane Austen came next with Pride and Prejudice, followed by Lewis Carroll’s fantasy adventure Alice in Wonderland and political satire Animal Farm by George Orwell.

The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, which is being released as a Hollywood blockbuster later this year, comes ninth and another political story - To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - is tenth.

Anne Hannaford, Director of Information and Learning Services at the university, said: 'It is interesting to see that most of the popular books to pass down the generations have strong moral messages entwined in them.

'The books that feature in the top 10 all provide thought-provoking content and characters, so it is clear that parents value these books for providing challenging thoughts which can last a lifetime.'

The survey took place to mark the opening of The Hive in Worcester - Europe’s first joint university and public library.

Ms Hannaford added: 'It
is great to see that parents want to share their love of reading and 
their favourite books with their children and we see this every day at 
The Hive with parents reading with their children in the library.'

Alice in Wonderland is the country's most-read book, with 41 per cent of the 2,000 adults surveyed having read it.

1. A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens 2. The Harry Potter series, JK Rowling 3. The Lord of The Rings trilogy, JRR Tolkien 4. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen 5. Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll 6. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, CS Lewis  7. Animal Farm, George Orwell 8. Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens 9. The Hobbit, JRR Tolkien 10. To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee

More than a third have read CS Lewis’ iconic The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, Kenneth Greene’s much-loved The Wind in The Willows and Roald Dahl’s whimsical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

The survey also revealed that one in five 18 - 24 year olds would pretend to have read a book to impress someone and that 35-44-year-olds are the most avid library visitors - nearly half say they visit the library.

More than half percent of adults said they missed reading, with a third admitting they have not read a book in ages.

One in five adults are unsure of where to look for a good book and believe they would read more if they knew which they would enjoy - 27 per cent of adults therefore choose a book by its cover.

Ms Hannaford said: 'Time is so precious nowadays that many people don’t have the luxury to read as much as they used to, therefore making the right decision on what to read is more important than ever.

'Investment in libraries and in particular, children’s libraries is vital for literary development of the next generation and visiting a modern library such as The Hive in Worcester provides an ideal opportunity for both adults and children to sample a range of literature without having to commit to buying a book.

'In addition, library staff are always happy to help people choose books to read while the space itself provides a quiet sanctuary away from the busyness of everyday life to allow readers to escape into books.

'This is crucial to help those who say they miss reading and don’t know what to read, get back to the joy of losing themselves in a good book and help parents and children share a love of literature together.'
