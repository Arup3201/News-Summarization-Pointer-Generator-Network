A Mississippi woman was sentenced to life in prison today for murder after injecting a woman with illegal silicone buttocks.

Tracey Lynn Garner of Jackson was sentenced Tuesday in Hinds County Circuit Court.

Garner was convicted Friday of depraved heart murder and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was sentenced to five years on the wire fraud charge.

Garner was charged in the death of Karima Gordon who, prosecutors say, was lured to Jackson by Garner to perform the injections.

Gordon, an Atlanta-area resident, died eight days after receiving the injections in 2012.

Prosecutors say Gordon and a friend were referred to Garner by Natasha Stewart, an adult entertainer also known as Pebbelz Da Model.

Stewart was convicted of manslaughter in February and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.

The prosecution said Stewart told Gordon that Garner was a nurse.

During the trial, defense attorney John Colette suggested that Gordon wanted exactly what Garner had to offer. 

'She wanted this underground, bargain basement butt enhancement,' Colette said.

He
 also stated that Gordon had other injections that could have caused her
 death, and argued that the silicone found in Gordon's body didn't match
 silicone seized from Garner's Jackson home.

'We don't know how much she'd gotten before she ever came to Mississippi,' Colette said.

'What silicone caused her death?'

The defense rested Friday without calling a witness after the prosecution finished its case.

Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside her makeshift cosmetic business, was described as a cross-dressing man and at first showed up to court registered as a man.

She was at first identified as Morris Garner.
