Jean Hughes, 77, was accused of dropping the computer despite insisting the damage had happened when opening it

When Jean Hughes needed a new laptop she ignored cheap online deals and went straight to her local John Lewis because of its reputation for excellent customer service.

But the pensioner’s faith in the company was rudely shaken after it disputed the cause of a crack that later appeared in the screen.

Staff accused her of dropping the computer despite the 77-year-old grandmother insisting the damage had happened when opening it.

After a David and Goliath battle lasting more than a year, she has finally been awarded a replacement after taking her claim to the small claims court.

An independent expert’s report she commissioned suggested there was a design fault and a judge found in her favour. John Lewis’s case was further undermined in a humiliating blunder when its legal representative presented statistics for the laptop’s reliability – only for Mrs Hughes to point out they had got the wrong model.

‘For the last three or four months I have had a lot of stress which has affected my skin and eyes,’ said the widow, who lives near St Albans, Hertfordshire.

‘People I have spoken to about this just can’t believe it. You can hear the surprise in their voices.

‘People should be wary of the customer service experience. It is not quite as positive as I’d thought.’

Mrs Hughes bought the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga at the Welwyn Garden City branch in August 2013 for £399.95. Five months later, she opened it and discovered an eight-inch crack around the edge of the screen.

When she took it back to the store, she was told she must have dropped it and should contact Lenovo direct. Surprised but undeterred, she wrote to the manager asking for the two-year warranty to be honoured.

She was told the laptop would have to be sent away for the fault to be investigated but it was not until June last year that it was returned to the store.

Mrs Hughes was then told she would have to pay £452.64 for a repair – more than the device cost in the first place.

Incensed at her treatment, she went to the store to complain on three more occasions before being offered £200 as a goodwill gesture, which she rejected. The offer was repeated at a legal mediation meeting and again at Hertford County Court on Monday, moments before her case was due to be heard.

The cracked screen (pictured on the top right corner) thought to have happened because the hinge was too tight and the screen was put under pressure when opened from the side

Mrs Hughes insisted on going ahead with the hearing and was astonished to see evidence presented by John Lewis which claimed it had sold 2,500 units and cracked screens had been reported in just six cases, with all the customers accepting it was caused by accidental damage.

The mother-of-two pointed out that the statistics were for the laptop that replaced her model, adding: ‘The woman didn’t know what to do then. We really did surprise her with that.’

A report Mrs Hughes commissioned from an engineer said the damage was likely to have occurred because the hinge was too tight and the screen was put under pressure when opened from one side.

She also presented evidence of conversations in online forums where people had discussed the same fault with the same laptop.

Mrs Hughes was using the computer on a project she was doing involving voluntary work with children. She won her case after taking it to the small claims court and will be given a replacement and paid court costs

The judge ruled on Monday that Mrs Hughes, who was using the computer on a project she was doing involving voluntary work with children, should be given a replacement device and awarded her £55 to cover the court fee and £54 for the engineer’s report.

A company spokesman said yesterday: ‘At John Lewis we always try our best to reach a happy outcome for our customers. The original assessment was carried out by the manufacturer, Lenovo. We believe that the manufacturer is best placed to determine the cause of any fault with an item.

‘However, we fully accept the judge’s ruling and are in the process of replacing Mrs Hughes’ laptop and will cover all of her costs.’
