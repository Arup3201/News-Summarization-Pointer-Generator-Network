This is the moment a man is hit by instant karma after laughing at his pet dog slipping and sliding in the snow.

Dan Chamberlain filmed his pooch gliding through McGolrick Park in Brooklyn, New York, as he struggled to maintain balance wearing winter booties on ice.

At first, Chamberlain gleefully chuckles as he watches the animal in action. But all of a sudden, swift payback strikes and he also falls flat on his bottom.

The camera suddenly drops down as Chamberlain falls to the ground.

One of his sneakers can be seen in the bottom corner of the frame.

His dog scoots off to play and ignores him. 

Chamberlain had decked the canine out with booties to protect his feet from salt pellets on the ground. 

To date a video of the duo falling has been watched more than 300,000 times.

Chamberlain titled the clip 'karma'. Next time he had better be more sympathetic to his dog's plight.
