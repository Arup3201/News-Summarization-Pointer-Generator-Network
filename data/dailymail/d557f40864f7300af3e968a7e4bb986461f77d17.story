'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies

A wife who was allegedly tortured by her husband for ten years today told a court that all her horrific burns and bruises were 'accidental'.

Stephanie Lizon testified at a preliminary hearing today after she arrived at a domestic abuse centre last month with terrible wounds allegedly inflicted by her husband Peter - who is said to have kept her chained while he tortured her.

Mrs Lizon, 43, arrived at the shelter in Leroy, West Virgina, with mutilated feet and burns on her back that appeared to have a come from a frying pan.

But she today claimed that her feet were injured in a farming accident and the frying pan injuries were frrm accidental contact during an argument with her husband.

She said: 'It was an accident. My husband and I were arguing. We collided with each other.'

When she was shown a picture of her foot injury - allegedly caused when her husband intentionally ran over her - she said farming was dangerous and her husband did not know the tractor was close to her feet.She said she did not seek medical treatment. 'I didn't think it warranted it,' she testified.

However prosecutor Katie Casto said the causes of the bruises were obvious.

'It is plain to a reasonable person that this was intentional,' Casto said. 'It's not an accident.'

Miss Lizon, fled her husband while they returned farm tools to a rental shop.

Staff at  Bosley Rental & Supply said she came into their office while her husband was in another part of the building and told the staff: 'I'm trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few minutes.'

Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want
to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic 
violence shelter and called it, the store employee said.

She also called family to ask for 
money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a
Western Union office and the shelter.

The
woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the 
store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad.

The employee also told investigators that 
the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her 
her husband had broken her fingers.

Mr Lizon did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said.

At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint.

The wife said her family was from Alexandria, Virginia.

Stephanie Lizon's father declined to discuss the case when contacted by the AP. Relatives of her husband didn't immediately return messages.

Investigators said they have 45 photographs showing burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying pans, and scars on her wrists and ankles.

Now her husband is in jail and authorities are investigating what Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tony Boggs called one of the most terrible cases he's seen.

'This appears to go beyond abuse to what I would consider torture,' he said Wednesday.

The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account:

She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan.

She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things.

The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room.

The wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm.

Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention.

She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh.

Boggs of the sheriff's office said state child-welfare authorities have been notified, but Peter Lizon's attorney said the child — a one-year-old boy — remains with his mother.

The complaint says investigators confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to document her injuries.

A Sunbeam iron was among the items seized during a July 5 search of the couple's home. Lizon was arrested that day.

Shawn Bayliss, attorney for Mr Lizon, compared the charges to the childhood game of 'telephone', where something whispered from one person to another ultimately bears no resemblance to reality.

'This is a situation where a person has taken a nugget of information, taken an acorn and tried to turn it into a tree,' he said. 'And the tree won't support this story.'

Back in Leroy, only a handful of houses dot the side of the approximately two-mile road where the couple lives.

In the front yard, signs read 'No Trespassing' and 'Guard Dog on Duty', although no dog could be seen.

One of two brightly colored barrels 
was filled with dozens of empty bottles of imported beer near a black 
van with no license plate.

Nobody answered the door at a neighbor's home. Nearby, screen doors were open and music could be heard coming from inside.

Cliff Boggess, 62, has lived in the 
area since 2005 and rode his all-terrain vehicle past the home Wednesday
evening. He said he was shocked by the news and said he's never noticed
any human activity at the house.

'Nothing. And I guarantee, that's the
same answer you'll get from everybody around here,' Boggess said. 'This
guy, whoever he (is), I've never seen him.'

Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were 
arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for 
cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet.

Court records also show that Mrs 
Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore 
County. She pleaded guilty and got probation.

The West Virginia Division of 
Corrections said it had no history of criminal actions by either spouse,
and Boggs said the sheriff's department had no previous contact with 
them, either.

Lizon is being held in the South Central Regional Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail.

Jackson County Deputy Sheriff Tony Boggs said: 'This is a case that is 
tenfold of what our average domestic is and maybe more than that. It 
comes down to what appears to be slavery and torture.

'It's amazing 
what one human being can do to another, and that should not ever happen 
or be allowed to happen.'
