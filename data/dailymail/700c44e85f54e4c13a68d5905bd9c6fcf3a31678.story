Rickie Lambert does not need to take a polygraph test to verify how much he is hurting after Liverpool’s Champions League exit. It is etched all over the striker’s face as he talks about the need to put things right against Manchester United on Sunday.

Lambert knows his emotional return to Anfield this season, 17 years after he was rejected as a Liverpool trainee, has not been a triumphant homecoming so far.

Like the club’s season in general, Lambert is in the middle of an anguished spell, which reached its low point on Tuesday night when he was substituted at half-time against Basel and forced to watch centre-back Martin Skrtel operate as a target man in his absence.

To be fair to the 32-year-old, he does not try to hide his pain, nor the team’s, after a 1-1 draw that saw them eliminated from the elite competition and consigned to the Europa League.

‘The mood was down when we got back into training on Thursday and we have been trying to get the spirits going again, put everything to bed and get fired up for the United game,’ said Lambert.

‘Everyone in that dressing room is hurting just as much as me. It wasn’t nice.

‘We’ve just got to look forward to Sunday now. Obviously there’s more pressure on us to get the win. If we can’t get up for this, we can’t get up for any game.’

It was not meant to be like this. Lambert’s £4million move from Southampton was one of the feelgood stories of the summer.

He was the Kirkby boy who left Liverpool at 15 to work in a beetroot factory and start a new playing career in the lower leagues with Macclesfield, Stockport and Rochdale.

Eventually, he ended up getting a fairytale move back to Liverpool as one of nine signings made by manager Brendan Rodgers to offset the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the summer.

But the reality has well and truly kicked in now with Liverpool’s top-four challenge faltering on a lack of goals, with Lambert and Mario Balotelli held chiefly responsible.

Lambert has scored just twice all season while Liverpool’s leading Premier League scorers — Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard — have managed only three goals apiece.

To put those statistics into context, Suarez hit four goals in one game against Norwich last winter.

‘All those cliches and thoughts of living the dream quickly got eradicated a few months after I joined,’ said Lambert.

‘Just because I’m a Liverpool fan doesn’t mean it’s nice when we’re not playing or not winning. It’s probably worse.

‘It’s hurting me personally and I have to try to get it out of my system. Let me be a player. A few of us didn’t play that well on Tuesday and we want to try to rectify it.’

The good news for Rodgers, also under pressure with many of his signings struggling, is that Lambert has been here before.

Right at the start of his career, he signed for Stockport from Macclesfield in a £300,000 deal that represented a lot of money for the club, and scored only twice in 32 games in his first season there.

He said: ‘I’ve had a lot of experiences that will help me. I’ve always believed in my ability and that I can score goals. I’m more than confident that I can start scoring.

‘I’ve been doing well in the last month, though I didn’t have a good game the other night. I know I can do better.

‘As a team, I wouldn’t judge us too quickly. Wait until Danny Sturridge is back and all our signings have completely gelled, then judge us. I believe we will start going on a run.

‘Common sense tells you if you’re looking at an entirely new back four and an entirely new attacking line, it is mistaken to think we would carry on the same as last year or anywhere near it. It was always going to take time.’

As a boyhood fan, it is inevitable today’s trip to Old Trafford — regarded by Koppites as the biggest match of the season — will be special.

Lambert was in the crowd when United won the 1996 FA Cup final and Liverpool’s players were dubbed ‘Spice Boys’ for wearing white Armani suits as they strolled around Wembley before kick-off.

‘It’s a fixture I’ve always watched. It’s brilliant — the atmosphere, the intensity of the game,’ he said. ‘There’s a lot of respect but a bit of hatred as well.

‘It’s everything we want in a game. Two good teams, two top clubs going head to head. I’m looking forward to it.

‘I went to Wembley when Cantona scored the winner. I’ve been to a few at Anfield as well but I’m trying not to look at it as a fan any more. I’ve got a job to do whether I’m starting or on the bench.

‘We’ve got to be very respectful of the attacking aspect of United. They’ve got one of the best in the country, but we’ve got to feel confident that we can attack them, too. We’re different as well so we’ve got to go there with a game plan.’

Last March, Liverpool beat United 3-0 at Old Trafford. Lambert, then a Southampton player, recalls being ‘animated’ as he watched on television.

This time the game means even more, as a player rather than a fan.
