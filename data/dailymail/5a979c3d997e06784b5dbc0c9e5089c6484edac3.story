Doctors say 24-year-old Ashley Caughey has only months to live after malignant bone cancer spread unchecked throughout her body.

She worries she won't see her daughter Paisley's first birthday, the little girl she refused chemotherapy treatment for in order to give birth to her last year.

CNN reports she  had just gotten engaged to her now-husband Jonathan when she faced a gut-wrenching diagnosis - a cancer called osteosarcoma had developed in her leg.

Agonizing decision: Ashley Caughey refused chemotherapy to give birth to her baby daughter Paisley, and doctors say she has only months to live

Caughey had suffered aches in her knee since 2012, but it wasn't until the pain sent her to the hospital that the invasive bone cancer was discovered.

'The doctor that I went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something wasn't right probably cost me my life,' Ashley says, adding, 'I could have had more time.'

She was sent to surgery to remove her knee and femur, and doctors advised her to begin chemotherapy treatment.

Caughey refused, as the treatment would have put her 10-week pregnancy at risk.

'I'm not going to kill a healthy baby because I'm sick,' she says. 'There's nothing wrong with her.'

She gave birth to a daughter, Paisley, in June, but shortly after the delivery, she received more bad news that the cancer has spread throughout her body and even to the brain.

Treatment: After the birth, Caughey went on radiation treatment, but at that point a scan showed the cancer had spread throughout her body

Wedding: The couple pushed up their wedding date to November, with Caughey's 6-year-old son Braiden walking her down the aisle

'When they told me that, I think "Oh my gosh, I am really dying. I'm not going to beat this,"' says Caughey, who  tries to stay hopeful in the face of unrelentingly bad news.

After the diagnosis, the couple sped up the wait for their wedding, getting married this past November. Caughey's six-year-old son Braiden walked her down the aisle.

She began radiation treatment after the birth, and though doctors say she now has only a few months to live, Caughey is making the short time she has count, and documenting everything on camera.

'I love that my kids are actually going to see me fighting instead of it being like, you know, "Your mom was this. Your mom was that. Your mom fought as hard as she could,"' Caughey says.

'They're actually going to see my love for them,' she added. 'Paisley is going to know how much I love her.'
