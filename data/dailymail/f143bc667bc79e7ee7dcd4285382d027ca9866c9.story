Devastated: Lee Rigby's fiancee Aimee West wore full uniform at his funeral. She is reportedly leaving the army

The fiancee of murdered soldier Lee Rigby is reportedly leaving the army because she has been unable to cope after his death.

Ms West has told friends she can no longer serve in the Royal Military Police.

She and Fusilier Rigby met through the Army - where she was a cadet at the time - after he split amicably from his first wife Rebecca, 30, with whom he had a two-year-old son Jack.

She was later posted to Afghanistan, which she left to make a tearful return in May to lay flowers at the spot where her husband-to-be was killed in 
Woolwich, south east London.

A friend told the Sunday Mirror: 'Aimee and Lee met through the army and it was always at the centre of their life together.

'Serving their country was so important for them. They shared their experiences and helped each other.

'But without Lee she finds it too difficult trying to focus on a career in which he played such a big part.'

Fusilier Rigby, who served in Cyprus, Jordan, Germany and Afghanistan, had proposed to Ms West just a few months before his death.

His funeral at Bury Parish Church was attended by both his fiancee and his widow, with whom he had been on good terms.

Killed: Lee Rigby died in May, just months after proposing to his girlfriend Aimee West

The pair were due to run the Paris marathon together and Aimee, who was given compassionate leave after his death, has been training to run the race in his memory in aid of the armed forces charity SSAFA Forces Help.

A Ministry of Defence source told the paper Aimee remains in the army reserves, but did not comment further.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, and Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, have pleaded not guilty to Fusilier Rigby's murder.

They are due to stand trial from November 18.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
