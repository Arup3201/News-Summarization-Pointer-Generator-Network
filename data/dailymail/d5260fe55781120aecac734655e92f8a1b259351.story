The captain of the South Korean ferry that capsized three days ago with hundreds of schoolchildren aboard today defended his decision to delay its evacuation.

Police charged Lee Joon-Seok and two of his crew early in the morning. All three have been criticised for leaving behind hundreds of passengers, while abandoning ship themselves.

But Lee insisted he feared the outcome could have been worse if he had given the order to man the lifeboats too early. 'At the time a 
rescue ship had not arrived,' he said. 'There were also no fishing boats around for
 rescues, or other ships to help.

'The currents were very strong and the water was cold at that time in the area. I thought that passengers would be swept far away and fall into trouble if they evacuated thoughtlessly.'

Their arrests came as divers fighting 
through rough seas finally reached the sunken vessel and began pulling 
the bodies of drowned victims from inside.

Lee has been charged under maritime law with negligence and failing to secure the safety of passengers. Thirty-two have been confirmed dead so far, and a further 273 are still missing.

Most of them are schoolchildren who were on a high school holiday trip.

As the arrests were being made, dive teams who had spent two days vainly battling powerful currents and near zero visibility, finally made it to the passenger decks of the 6,825-tonne Sewol.

'Civilian divers spotted three bodies through a window,' a senior coastguard officer said. 'They attempted to get in and retrieve them by cracking the window, but it was too difficult,' he said in a briefing to relatives of the missing.

Relatives of the missing passengers, 
who have been sleeping in a gymnasium on Jindo island near the scene of 
the disaster, were shown video footage from one dive.

Even
 with a powerful underwater flashlight, visibility was measured in 
inches as the diver was seen groping his way blindly along the side of 
the ship with the help of a pre-attached rope.

Captain Lee was arraigned this morning along with the two officers in charge of the bridge at the time. Dressed
 in dark raincoats with their hoods pulled up, the three kept their 
heads bowed as they were paraded before TV cameras in a police station.

Experts have suggested many more 
people might have escaped if they had moved to reach evacuation points 
before the ship listed sharply and water started flooding in.

The
 relatives camped out in the Jindo gym - most of the them parents of 
high school students - have sharply criticised the pace of the rescue 
operation, accusing officials of incompetence and indifference.

Only 174 were rescued when the ferry sank and no new survivors have been found since Wednesday.

Nam
 Sung-Won, whose 17-year-old nephew was among the missing, said the 
clock was fast running down on the hope that some may have survived.

'We don't have much time. Many people here believe this is the last possible day for finding trapped passengers alive,' said Mr Nam. 'After today, hope will be gone.'

For those relatives ready to accept the worst outcome, the coastguard had set up a tent near the gym to take DNA tests to facilitate eventual identification of recovered bodies.

Standing in the queue to give a sample was Han Mi-Ok, whose teenage son is listed as missing in the disaster. She told AFP: 'Up until yesterday, I was still hanging on to some hope. But today I'm bracing myself for the worst.'

More than 350 of those on board were students from Kang's Danwon High School in Ansan city just south of Seoul.

The unfolding tragedy was compounded by the apparent suicide yesterday of the school's vice principal, Kang Min-Kyu, who was seemingly overcome by guilt at having organised the trip, and surviving the sinking.

It is understood that a note was found in his pocket which read: 'Surviving alone is too painful while 200 remain unaccounted for. I take full responsibility. I pushed ahead with the school trip.

'I will once again become a teacher in the afterlife for my students whose bodies have not been discovered.' 

South Korea's Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries has released a transcript of the conversation between Jeju Vessel Traffic Services Centre (VTS) on Jeju Island and the Sewol, the ferry that sank on Wednesday. Originally in Korean, the transcript has been translated by The Associated Press. It starts off from the first distress call made by the ferry.

Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, do you have reception of the Sewol?

Jeju VTS: Yes, Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju

Sewol: Please notify the coast guard. Our ship is in danger. It's listing right now.

Jeju VTS: Where's your ship? Yes, got it. We will notify the coast guard.

Sewol: The ship has listed a lot. Can't move. Please come quickly.

Sewol: We're next to Byeongpung Island.

Jeju VTS: Yes, we got it.

Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju. Do you have reception? Sewol, Harbour affairs Jeju.

Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, this is Sewol

Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju. Channel 21, please.

Jeju VTS: Sewol, this is Harbour affairs Jeju.

Sewol: Jeju, Sewol here.

Jeju VTS: What's the current situation?

Sewol: Currently the body of the ship has listed to the left. The containers have listed as well.

Jeju VTS: OK. Any loss of human life or injuries?

Sewol: It's impossible to check right now. The body of the ship has tilted, and it's impossible to move.

Jeju VTS: Yes, OK. Please wear life jackets and prepare as the people might have to abandon ship.

Sewol: It's hard for people to move.

Jeju VTS: Yes, got it.

Sewol: Harbour affairs Jeju, do you have reception of Sewol?

Jeju VTS: Yes, this is Harbour affairs Jeju, Sewol.

Sewol: What's going on with the coast guard?

Jeju VTS: Yes, we have notified the coast guard. Currently we are calling Jindo VTS and Wando VTS. Please hold for a moment.

After this, Jeju VTS notified other ships and Wando VTS.

Initial questioning of the captain has focused on what actually caused the ferry to sink. Tracking data from the Maritime Ministry showed the vessel made a sharp turn just before sending its first distress signal.

Some experts believe a tight turn could have dislodged the heavy cargo manifest - including more than 150 vehicles - and destabilised the vessel, causing it to list heavily and then capsize.

Captain Lee confirmed he was not at the helm when the ship ran into trouble.

The ship was being steered by a 55-year-old helmsman identified by his surname Jo, under the supervision of the female third officer. Reports suggested it was the first time that the sailor had navigated those waters.

'It may have partly been my fault,' Jo said at the arraignment. 'But the steering gear rotated unusually fast.'

Three giant, floating cranes are now at the rescue site, but coastguard officials stressed they would not begin lifting the multi-deck ferry until they were sure there were no survivors inside.
