Fantasist: Menachem Youlus pleaded guilty to fraud after he obtained almost $1 million by inventing Indiana Jones-style adventures

A Jewish charity founder who claimed he travelled the world as a 'Jewish Indiana Jones' to rescue holy scrolls has admitted he was a $1 million fraudster.

Menachem Youlus told the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, New York he lied about making risky trips to obtain vintage Torah scrolls in Europe and Israel for six years.

The texts are sacred to the Jewish faith, and followers believe they contain the rules that God intended mankind to live by.

Among the fantastical tales Youlus invented were detailed accounts of recovering Torah lost or hidden during the Holocaust, including at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.

Youlus, 50, who owns the Jewish 
Bookstore in Wheaton, Maryland, allegedly boasted that he had been 
'beaten up, thrown in jail, and gone $175,000 into debt, to bring these 
holy scrolls out of less-than-friendly places, back to safety and a new 
life.'

The court heard he had fabricated 
various exploits between 2004 and 2010 in order to obtain funds from his
Save a Torah charity and some of its contributors.

'I know what I did was wrong, and I deeply regret my conduct,' Youlus said yesterday.

Prosecutors
claim the would-be adventurer defrauded his charity and its donors out 
of $862,000 (£544,000), and are calling for him to serve up to five 
years and three months in prison.

During his guilty plea, Youlus said his lies included telling prospective buyers that he had personally retrieved parts of one scroll from a metal box at Auschwitz, which he located and unearthed using a metal detector.

A buyer who believed this tale paid about $32,000 (£20,000) directly to Youlus' bookstore to buy the Auschwitz Torah, then donated it to a Manhattan synagogue which staged a large ceremony to honour its resettlement.

Youlus also falsely claimed to have discovered a Torah in 2002 that had been hidden under the floor of a barracks at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany during World War II.

This lie was debunked by a historian at the Bergen-Belsen Memorial Museum, who told prosecutors the bookseller's 'rescue' was impossible because the barracks was completely destroyed by the British Army after the camp's liberation.

Priceless: Torah scrolls contain Jewish religious teachings, and are items of huge significance in the Jewish faith. Many were destroyed and desecrated by the Nazis during the Second World War

U.S. Postal Inspector Greg Ghiozzi, who prepared the criminal complaint against Youlus, said he told the president of his charity that he had borrowed over $150,000 (£94,000) and over $200,000 (£126,000) on his credit cards and against his home to acquire and repair 15 Torah that were facing rapid deterioration or destruction, including 10 from an unspecified Russian general and five from a monastery in Kiev, Ukraine.

The complaint said Youlus had distributed Torah he bought from American dealers to synagogues and congregations across the country, sometimes at inflated rates.

It said he put nearly a third of the $1.2 million (£760,000) collected by the charity into his personal accounts, spending $90,000 (£56,000) on private school tuition for his children and on personal expenses, including meals and healthcare.

Fictional adventurer: Harrison Ford played action hero Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and relic-hunter, in George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's cult film franchise

The publicly-stated mission of the charity was to locate and acquire Torah that survived the Holocaust or had been taken from Jewish communities worldwide and repair them so they could be used in communities that need them.

But authorities said Youlus rarely left the U.S. during the years he had claimed to be unearthing Torah.

Youlus apparently dubbed himself 'the Jewish Indiana Jones' at a Torah dedication in 2004, referencing the treasure-hunting adventure hero played by Harrison Ford in the 1981 Stephen Spielberg film 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. 

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said of Youlus: 'He chose poorly in allegedly exploiting an excruciating chapter in Jewish and international history to perpetrate a brazen fraud that played on the heartstrings of the people for whom the painful memories of that period will never die.'

Youlus' lawyer Benjamin Brafman has said he will seek leniency at the bookseller's sentence hearing on 21 June, describing him as 'a good man with the best of intentions who ultimately strayed into fraudulent conduct that he now accepts full responsibility for'.

The Torah is the first part of the Jewish bible, the most important document in Judaism.

It is made up of five books, which Jews believe were dictated by God to the prophet Moses on Mount Sinai.

The ten commandments are among the writings contained in the texts, which in Judaism provide a guide to God's laws. 

Torah scrolls are handwritten in Hebrew on parchment from a kosher animal, usually a cow.

The teachings are so sacred that it is said that if a scroll is accidentally dropped in the synagogue, the whole congregation must fast for 40 days.

Persecuted Jewish communities have often gone to great lengths to preserve the Torah, which are items of huge symbolic and physical importance to the faith.

Strict Jewish law forbids the sale of Torah scrolls unless the seller uses the proceeds to marry or to study Torah - and even then, they must have nothing else to sell.
