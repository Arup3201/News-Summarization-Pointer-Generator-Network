Playing dirty: Robert Hartshorne, former top scorer for non-league Glossop North End, controlled a gang who moved cocaine and other drugs around the north-west

A semi-professional footballer who lived a Premier League lifestyle while leading a £1m drugs ring has been jailed.

Robert Hartshorne, former top scorer for non-league Glossop North End, was also the leader of a seven-strong criminal gang who moved cocaine and other drugs around the north-west.

The 28-year-old, who plied his trade at several non-league teams, owned six houses worth over £600,000, while organising the gang in Hyde, Greater Manchester.

When police stormed Hartshorne’s home 
in Hyde, they found wardrobes brimming with expensive designer clothing,
over £30,000 worth of designer jewellery and photographs of his many 
luxury holidays.

The footballer was then arrested, and has since been jailed for 11 years.

Officers tried to arrest Hartshorne 
earlier as he met with someone at a takeaway in Hyde, but he ran away by
jumping over nearby gardens and fencing.

His car was searched, where £5,000 in cash was found along with a passport.

In a separate search, police stopped a car driven by another gang member on the A556 in Cheshire, and found £77,000 in cash stashed in a specially-modified boot compartment.

Hartshorne was sentenced along with eight other gang members for supplying cocaine.

Alan Page, 35, was the last member of the gang to be jailed after a long police investigation.

The gang were sentenced to more than 
54 years in prison, after police seized over £900,000 worth of drugs and
£110,000 in cash in a long investigation.

All members of the gang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine.

Haul: Police recovered cash, including this stash of £77,000, during a long-term investigation into Hartshorne and his gang

Alan Page, Michael Gaskell, Sean Cannon, Michael Tingey, Douglas Merron and Stephanie Merron were sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court.

The investigation was launched in November 2010 when police stopped a car in Stockport and recovered a large bag of cocaine, which had a street value of more than £95,000.

The fingerprints of Michael Gaskell were discovered on the bag, and the investigation uncovered the dealings of the gang led by Hartshorne.

Officers swooped on houses and cars during the investigation, uncovering huge amounts of money and cocaine - up to £345,000 worth at one time.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Rick Williams from Greater Manchester Police’s Force Drugs Unit said: 'This case clearly illustrates that GMP will go to great lengths in order to bring to justice criminals such as these, who seem to think they are beyond the reach of the law.

'Over many months, this group were evidenced running a highly organised drugs supply business, whereby high quality cocaine was diluted with cheaper adulterants in order to maximise profits and fund the lavish lifestyles of the ringleaders.

'It was the actions of Hartshorne and his criminal associates that caused misery to the lives of the law-abiding members of the local community, and it is for that reason that I take great satisfaction in the sentences handed down to them.'

Superintendent Neil Evans from GMP’s Tameside division said: 'Drugs are a major driving force behind many other crimes such as burglary, robbery and vehicle crime and so by targeting dealers, we are making our streets safer.

'These sentences just go to show that crime really does not pay and work will continue in Tameside through hard-hitting drugs operations to tackle those involved in this industry.

'We will also take back from them the money and assets they have made from their criminal dealings.

'If you have information on anyone who may be committing crime in your area, please call police in Tameside on 101.'
