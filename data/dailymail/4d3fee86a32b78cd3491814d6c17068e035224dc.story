A part-beagle named Buddy didn't wait for an invitation to see his 85-year-old master at a Texas hospital.

The dog hitched a ride on the outside of an ambulance transporting his owner, Mason County rancher J.R. Nicholson, to Fredericksburg.

Ranch hand Brian Wright said on Friday that he summoned the ambulance on October 26 when Nicholson started feeling dizzy.

The ambulance had been driving for about 20 miles before another motorist flagged down the driver to say there was a dog on the side step.

All aboard: Buddy the four-year-old part-Beagle was found on the bumper on an ambulance transporting his owner to hospital 20 miles into the journey after the ambulance driver was flagged down by a motorist

Buddy was then put into the ambulance with the patient.

'It was a crazy ordeal,' Tanner Brown, an emergency medical technician, told The San Angelo Standard-Times.

'We didn’t have anything else to do but to load the dog up and put him in the ambulance and take him to the ER with us.

Brown said he had never seen anything like it. 

'It was kind of weird,' he said.

'I guess the dog wanted to be with his owner.'

Wright drove separately to Hill Country Memorial Hospital, where medical staff told him what Buddy did and the dog was still in the ambulance. 

Loyal: Buddy and his owner went home from hospital together after the interesting incident

Wright retrieved the dog, then later drove his boss and Buddy home the same day after Nicholson was released.

Nicholson said he only got Buddy, who is four, about four months ago from the pound after his previous two dogs had to be put down.

'He’s now a member of the family,' Nicholson told the paper.
