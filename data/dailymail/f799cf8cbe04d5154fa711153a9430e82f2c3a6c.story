An Indiana State Police Trooper is being sued over claims that he questioned a woman about her religious beliefs and presented her with church materials during a traffic stop.

'It's completely out of line and it just — it took me back,' plaintiff Ellen Bogan told The Indianapolis Star.

Bogan is being represented by two attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.

'I'm not affiliated with any church,' she also said. 'I don't go to church. I felt compelled to say I did, just because I had a state trooper standing at the passenger-side window. It was just weird.'

Stopped: Ellen Borga has alleged Trooper Brian Hamilton gave her a church pamphlet during the August traffic stop 

The lawsuit alleges that 'After conducting a traffic stop at which Indiana State Police Trooper Brian Hamilton presented Ms. Bogan with a warning ticket, Trooper Hamilton prolonged the stop by asking Ms. Bogan, among other things, if she had accepted Jesus Christ as her savior and then presented her with a pamphlet from the First Baptist Church in Cambridge that informed the reader that he or she is a sinner, listed God's Plan of Salvation, noting that the person must realize that "the Lord Jesus Christ paid the penalty for your sins; and, advertised a radio broadcast entitled "Policing for Jesus Ministries."

The lawsuit goes on to allege that 'The actions of defendant Trooper Hamilton violated Ms. Bogan's rights under both the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Ms. Bogan is entitled to her damages.' 

'The whole time, his lights were on,' Bogan told The Indianapolis Star. 'I had no reason to believe I could just pull away at that point, even though I had my warning.' 

Her lawsuit alleges Hamilton's behavior was 'coercive,' 'unwarranted' and 'extremely upsetting.'

'Unconstitutional': Borga's lawsuit alleges that Hamilton's behavior was in violation of First and Fourth Amendments 

MailOnline has reached out to the Indiana State Police for comment.

Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law professor Jennifer Drobac told The Indianapolis Star 'The police officer is representing the government... so that means, as a representative, this person, while on duty, while engaged in official action, is basically overstepping and is trying to establish religion.'

However, Micah Clark of the American Family Association of Indiana told the newspaper 'I have people pass out religious material all the time. Mormons come to my door all the time, and it doesn't offend me. [This case] might not be the most persuasive time to talk to someone about their faith, but I don't think that a police officer is prohibited from doing something like that.'
