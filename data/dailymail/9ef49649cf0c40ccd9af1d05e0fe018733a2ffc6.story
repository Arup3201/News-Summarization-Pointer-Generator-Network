Basildon mayor Mo Larkin, 66, has ended her relationship with John Handley, also 66, after it was revealed that his illustrious past was a fabrication

A mayor's consort who boasted of a distinguished past serving as a diplomat and in the armed forces is actually a TV repair man turned cleaner, it was revealed today.

John Handley, 66, who accompanied Basildon mayor Mo Larkin, also 66, to official functions during their four-year relationship, told people he had helped the peace process in Palestine after being hurt in 'friendly fire' while serving in the Gulf War.

But Handley, who was also called 'Dr' on official council correspondence because he said he had a PhD in law, was today exposed as a fantasist  - and dumped by his Conservative mayor lover.

Rival Labour councillors are now calling on Mrs Larkin to quit and have asked Essex Police to investigate whether the mayor and her grey-haired lover, whom she met in 2006, had committed misconduct in public office.

Mrs Larkin, who this summer was criticised after she was pictured looking at her phone during an Armed Services Day ceremony, issued a statement distancing herself from Mr Handley after it was revealed he he had lied about his past.

She said: 'Following allegations and rumours that have been circulating for some time about John Handley, I would now like to make it public that I ended our relationship last week.

'I will always put the reputation of Basildon borough and that of the office of the mayor above my personal feelings.'

Mrs Larkin insisted that her ex-boyfriend had not influenced her political work for Basildon Council and said it was 'up to him' to deal with any further accusations.

Mr Handley, who lives in Southend, said: 'I am just a member of the public.  We are not a couple any more so it's not an embarrassment to her.

'I have never been a part of the council or a Conservative.  I have only ever driven Mo to places and enjoyed her company. 

'I adore the woman, but that's it.'

As the mayor's consort, Mr Handley accompanied her to official engagements including meeting the Essex High Sheriff Julia Abel Smith, in white trouser suit, left, and former star footballer Sir Geoff Hurst, right, in jeans

As the mayor's consort, Mr Handley drove her to functions where he rubbed shoulders with celebrities, politicians and dignitaries ranging from singer Will Young to football legend Sir Geoff Hurst.

At official engagements he boasted of his illustrious past, telling people he served in the Royal Navy before working on the peace process in Palestine.

He told a reporter at the Basildon Echo that US President Barack Obama had asked for his help on the Edward Snowden scandal, and boasted that he had worked for Hillary Clinton, helping her fight a smear campaign suggesting she was a lesbian.

Nigel Smith, Basildon Labour group leader, said: 'He and the mayor have led me to believe as recently as July he was a naval officer, worked with the United Nations, Foreign Office and Tony Blair and still exchanges Christmas presents with David Miliband.'

After the Royal Navy confirmed they had 'no records for this individual', and the UN and Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the same, Mr Smith said: 'It is disgusting he could say he is a distinguished person and war hero.'

Rumours about Mr Handley's past not being what he said it was began circulating this summer after he posted a tweet in June boasting: 'Saw Obama and Clinton today, legal work in the States is going viral. #hush! butIamricherstill [sic].'

A reporter asked him about his work there, and Mr Handley said he had been helping Mrs Clinton on her election campaign and had even been invited to join her team of legal advisers.

He also claimed to have worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the aftermath of the Kenyan mall shooting, helping to get the bodies of British victims home, although the FCO said there was no John Handley working for them.

The mayor's lover told the same reporter he was told he would 'never walk again' after being injured by US bombs in the Gulf War, and implied he had killed in action, saying: 'It's the most unnatural thing to do and you suffer in your heart and mind...

'Each time you kill it gets worse.  I have been there, done that, worn the t-shirt.  There is nothing glamorous or heroic.

'I don't want anyone to say what a heroic man I am - I don't feel like that at all.'

When told the Royal Navy had no record of him, Mr Handley said: 'No, they won't have - that's why I don't go public.

'But I'm not going to go into it.  Whose business is it, really?'

He said he gained legal qualifications at 'London University', but later admitted his PhD came from an online, unaccredited, company called Camden University USA, which is not recognised as an educational institution.

Mr Handley said the institution was accredited when he did the online course in 2007, and hoped his qualification could be transferred to another university so that it could be registered and accepted in the UK.  A certificate he produced to back this up bore the name of 'Ashley University' in the US.

A former colleague of Mr Handley's in his home town of Ramsgate, Kent, said he had worked for a TV rental repair chain until it folded in 1988, before setting up a cleaning firm.

Paul Young, 59, who said he worked with Mr Handley from 1971 to 1981, said: 'If you said you had a Jag, he said he had two and he had got them before you.'

A Basildon Council spokesman said: 'Although Mr Handley has no official council position, we recognise as the mayor's partner he has supported her and helped her carry out a very considerable amount of good work.

'Allegations being levelled at him are a private matter.  They are not related to council policies and should therefore in no way reflect on its reputation.'
