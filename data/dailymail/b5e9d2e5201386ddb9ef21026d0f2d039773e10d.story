Hot yoga has become the one of the most fashionable forms of exercise, with a celebrity following including Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Coleen Rooney.

Pouring with sweat from contorting their bodies into difficult positions in sweltering heat, it's devotees swear it improves flexibility, aids weight loss and can even relieve the symptoms of common ailments like depression and arthritis.

But now, one doctor warns it could have an ugly side effect: thread veins.

The news comes after U.S. research dispelled one myth about hot yoga, finding people who practiced the craze didn't burn any more calories or work harder than than in regular yoga.

Dr Peter Finigan, Medical Director at Dr Newmans Clinic and a specialist in thread vein removal, says the number of patients he has treated for thread veins whose hobby is hot yoga has gone up by 25 per cent year on year.

He said: 'Hot yoga is definitely an exacerbating factor in making facial thread veins more obvious. 

As the body temperature rises, blood vessels dilate allowing blood to flow near the surface of the skin to help cool it down.'

He added: 'Two years ago, we didn’t treat any patients who did hot yoga. One patient had recently qualified as a hot yoga instructor and had developed more facial thread veins over the 18 months that she had been teaching.'

He advised hot yoga fans to limit the number of sessions they do per week.  

And it's not only hot yoga that can bring about thread veins, the unsigthly red or purple wiggly lines that develop as we age and our skin and blood vessels become less elastic.

They can come about from washing in either very hot or cold water.

This causes the blood vessels in the skin to dilate or clamp shut – which over time can trigger thread veins – as the skin flushes as it reacts to cope with the extremes in temperature.

Dr Finigan said: 'I would advise patients against washing in extremely hot or cold water for a prolonged period of time, which I would say is about 15-20 minutes, on a regular basis.'

Fillers and rhinoplasty

They are also a common side effect of facial fillers and rhinoplasty - or nose reshaping – as the skin reacts to the 'trauma' of the injection or the procedure.

Dr Finigan said: 'We have a key number of patients who regularly have fillers, who come and see us to have their thread veins removed – usually once a year – as they reappear when the fillers are injected.'

'It's a vicious circle because they want to have the fillers to plump out the creases in their face but then they get thread veins.'

Much of the increase has been parallel to the general rise in people having fillers. According to Whatclinic.com, demand for dermal fillers in 2013 increased by 93 per cent in the UK.

As a direct consequence, Dr Newmans Clinic has seen a rise of 15 per cent amongst patients, usually women aged 35 or older, seeking treatment for thread veins after having dermal fillers.

Procedures such as facelifts can result in thread veins - and as they tend to appear around the temples and in front of the ears - they are a clear giveaway that the person has had the procedure. In this instance, the thread veins are caused by a reaction or irritation of the skin.

Dr Finigan added: 'Thread veins are a recognised side effect of facelifts, and they can reoccur due to the traction of the skin over time.'

While the majority of patients Dr Finigan treats are women, he is now seeing some children in the clinics who want to get rid of a specific type of thread vein called a 'spider naevi'. 

Thread veins are unsightly red or purple wiggly lines that develop as we age and our skin and blood vessels become less elastic

Hot yoga is the new fashionable exercise - but sweltering in a room heated up to 43°C could cause thread veins, as heat causes blood vessels to dilate which allows blood to flow near the surface of the skin

This is a red dot with tiny thread veins coming out of it, usually found on the the face, hands and shoulders.

'We see a handful of children at each clinic throughout the year, who have spider naevi treated' he said.

'However, the majority of patients are adults. Some patients have an underlying cause such as hormonal changes due to pregnancy, or liver disease – but some people just get them.'

'We tend to treat more women than men, but this is probably due to women exposing these areas more than men.'

Dr Finigan treats thread veins and spider naevi using 'thermocoagulation'. This uses microwave technology to heat fine blood vessels and destroy them quickly, without scarring.

They can also be treated using laser treatment or sclerotherapy. This treatment uses a tiny needle (smaller than a sewing needle) to inject a solution (scelerosant) that causes microscopic damage to the cells lining the vein. 

The vein gradually shrinks and disappears over a period of about eight weeks.
