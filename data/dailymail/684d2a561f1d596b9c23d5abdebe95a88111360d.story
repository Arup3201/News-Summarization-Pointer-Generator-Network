Over 300 million people use Instagram every month - making it more popular than Twitter.

The site, owned by Facebook, also revealed more than 70 million photos and videos are shared by its members every day.

CEO Kevin System today said: 'We’re proud to announce that there are now more than 300 million Instagrammers,' as the firm overtook Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg posted this picture to the site to celebrate the news.

Facebook finalised the purchase of Instagram in September 2012.

The social networking site bid $1bn (£628m) for Instagram in April, and was given the green light for the deal from US regulators at the end of August.

But, after the sharp fall in Facebook shares since the firm went public in May, the cash plus share offer ended up being worth nearer $700m. 

'We’re proud to announce that there are now more than 300 million Instagrammers,' CEO Kevin Systrom said.

'Over the past four years, what began as two friends with a dream has grown into a global community that shares more than 70 million photos and videos each day. 

'Instagram is home to creativity in all of its forms, a place where you can find everything from images of the Nile River to the newest look from Herschel Supply or a peek inside the mind of Taylor Swift.'

Systrom told the Wall Street Journal the firm was key to Facebook, which bought it in 2012.  

'Instagram can engage generations of people that may not be on Facebook yet. 

'I think that’s true with WhatsApp and I think that will be true with things like Oculus rift, the virtual reality headset firm).'

'Mark [Zuckerberg] is very good at understanding that you have to have multiple offerings. 

Systrom also said the firm was planning to expand dramatically in the advertising space.

'But our real value in the long run is going to be in the advertising space. 

'We’re doing advertising in a fairly unique way'.

The rise of Instagram: The firm launched in October 2010, and reached a million users by December 2010, before its growth exploded - adding 100m users since March of 2014.

The firm last week revealed its top snaps -  with a picture taken during Kim Kardashian's nuptials with Kanye West has made history as the most liked of all time on Instagram.

The image of the couple kissing, posted by the reality TV star bride after her Florence ceremony, has been given the thumbs up by 2.4 million users.

Now, it says it will focus on helping users find more people to follow - and begin authenticating users and cutting back on spam. 

'As Instagram gets bigger, we’re focused on helping you discover photos and videos from people who you care about, whether it’s a friend or your favorite musician. 

Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg also joined the celebration, posting this picture

According to Instagram, the most liked image during 2014 was Kim Kardashian’s wedding post in May (pictured) that received more than 2.4 million likes. It is also the most liked image ever posted on the four-year-old app.

 'Today, we’re excited to announce verified badges for celebrities, athletes and brands, making it easier for you to connect with the authentic accounts you’re looking for.

 The firm also pledged to cut down on spam. 

'Keeping Instagram authentic is critical—it’s a place where real people share real moments. 

'We’re committed to doing everything possible to keep Instagram free from the fake and spammy accounts that plague much of the web, and that’s why we’re finishing up some important work that began earlier this year.
