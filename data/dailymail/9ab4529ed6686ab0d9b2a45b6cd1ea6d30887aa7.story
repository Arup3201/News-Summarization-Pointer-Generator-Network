Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard is officially the best dribbler and most creative player in the Premier League this season.

According to statistics from WhoScored.com, the 24-year-old has made 67 chances for his team-mates, level with team-mate Cesc Fabregas and three more than Stewart Downing in third.

He has also completed far more dribbles (112) than any other player in 2014-15, well clear of Arsenal pair Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (76) and Alexis Sanchez (74).

Hazard has also been fouled the most times (74) - Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is second (60) - and made the most key passes in open play (61), ahead of Southampton's Dusan Tadic and Sterling (both 53).

He's also completed more passes in the final third (714) than anyone in the Premier League this season, well ahead of his team-mate Fabregas (573) and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla (555). 

The Blues star man has benefited from his good form by signing a new five-and-a-half-year deal at the club worth £200,000-per-week.

And Hazard sung the praises of manager Jose Mourinho and the Chelsea fans upon penning his new deal this week.

'The manager has helped me improve a lot, the fans have been fantastic and I have an amazing understanding with my team-mates,' Hazard said.

'I always try to give pleasure to the supporters with my style of play and it is nice to know they appreciate my work.

'I hope we can repay that support by winning lots of trophies, beginning with the Capital One Cup at Wembley, and after that, we can push hard towards the end of the season.'

Mourinho added: 'I am very happy that Eden has signed a new contract.

'It shows he believes in the club's coaching staff and players to help him become the best player in the world.

'He is already a top player and his evolution has been fantastic. He is still very young and he can become the best.'
