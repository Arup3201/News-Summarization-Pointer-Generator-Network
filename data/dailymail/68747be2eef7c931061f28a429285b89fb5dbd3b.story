A Texas student killed by a campus cop during a traffic stop last year was nearly twice the legal limit when the officer shot him five times, an autopsy has revealed.

Cameron Redus, 23, had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was stopped for driving erratically and killed by Corporal Christopher Carter outside his San Antonio apartment on December 6.

Redus' family have said that despite their son's mistakes that night, the severity of these mistakes did not warrant the treatment he suffered at the hands of Carter.

The autopsy, released Thursday, revealed all of the five shots fired by Carter were at close range.

Killed: Cameron Redus, who was described by friends as not being aggressive, was shot five times at close range by a campus cop who had pulled him over for driving erratically last December

Details of the medical examiner's report, released to Kens5, showed the University of the Incarnate Wood student had gun shot wounds to his left eye, upper chest, back, left elbow and right hip.

Confrontation: Corporal Chris Carter fired several times at the student

The shot to the back became lodged in Cameron's heart and was 'the most immediately lethal,' the medical examiner reported.

A shot to the eye could also have been lethal, the report added.

The student's family say he was never aggressive or confrontational but, according to Corporal Carter, Cameron tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically.

His parents, Mickey and Valerie Redus, and their other sons, released a statement saying they were 'devastated' by the autopsy findings.

'We are stunned to learn that Cameron was
 shot in the back from very close range. The report also shows that the 
shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle, again from very close
 range,' they wrote.

'That knowledge, coupled with information from the earlier police 
report indicating that Cameron died on his back with his legs underneath
 him, has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core.'

The family added that they did not 
condone his decision to drive while under the influence, but said they 
were 'thankful' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on 
the night in question.

They added: 'Cameron’s mistakes do not negate the 
amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving, encouraging and 
compassionate person that he was.

'While mistakes do bear consequences, 
the extreme and brutal results of Cameron’s encounter with Officer 
Carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes.'

Fatal: An autopsy report shows Cameron was shot at close range and in the back

Crime scene: Police investigate the street outside Cameron's apartment, where he was shot dead

The
 Incarnate Word student was in his final year at the San Antonio 
university and had been celebrating the end of the fall semester with 
friends when he was shot outside his apartment.

In a press conference after the shooting, Chief
 Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department, said Cameron had 
wrestled Captain Carter's baton from him and hit the policeman in the 
head and arm with it.

Captain Carter eventually got the baton back and told Cameron four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot.

That's
 when the student allegedly turned around and charged at Captain Carter 
with his arm raised to strike, and Captain Carter fired six shots, 
hitting Cameron five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh.

While
 the camera on the police cruiser 
was out, audio was still working which captured Captain Carter warning 
the student 56 
times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his 
back and three times that he was under arrest, the police claimed.

Heartbroken: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil. The family were shocked by the contents of the autopsy

Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting

Shortly after his death, Cameron's parents said: 'Our family does not believe the 
officer’s report ... For him to confront a police officer would be completely out of his character.'

In the statement, reported in KVUE, the family said: 'We are grieved by the tragic and unnecessary death of our son Cameron.'

Friends and professors of Cameron told his parents 'just how much they admired and respected Cameron and expected him to be a success in life'.

Mr and Mrs Redus added: 'We expect all official reports to confirm that Cameron’s death was unnecessary and unjustified.'

The
 family said they knew their son would have been unarmed and added that 
the police had searched his apartment and cleaned up the scene before 
they arrived.

Police are investigating the shooting but the family said they 
questioned the campus officer's decision to follow an unknown person to 
an off-campus apartment.

'Even if Cameron was driving erratically,
 he presented no threat to the campus police officer or anyone else once
 he parked his truck,' they said in the statement.

Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot

The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university.

More than 200 people - including the student's 
mother and father - attended a vigil to mourn the UIW student 
and remember his short life.

Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Cameron for three years.

'He
 was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have 
heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' 
he said.

'There's just an 
outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people 
in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, 
another friend, told KENS 5.

'Our
 thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer 
involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said.

Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May

Cameron had moved to San Antonio from
 Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated 
as co-valedictorian.

His academic success continued at 
UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time 
anchor for the school's student newscast.

'I
 grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they 
are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones.
