Daytime TV treasure, Lorraine Kelly, has taken to the fashion circuit to in a bid change older women's approach to style.

The ITV presenter has today been announced as the brand ambassador of fashion retailer JD Williams, beginning her role as the brand relaunches in July for the autumn season.

Lorraine will also dabble in the world of design for Spring of next year when she launches her own fashion collection for the brand that will be available from January 2015.

The partnership will also see Lorraine feature in a brand new TV advertising campaign in a bid to cater for women in their 50s who feel as though other clothing retailers have let them down.

For the daytime TV star - who is famous for her figure flattering outfit choices - this seems like the perfect partnership so it's a wonder she didn't do it sooner. However, Lorraine reveals that it has always been on her to do list.

'Designing a fashion collection has always been a dream of mine and I
 am delighted to be working with JD Williams' said the presenter.

The over 50 female fashion market in the 
UK is currently worth £2.5 billion per season, and is the fastest 
growing fashion sector, so it is surprising that it is so under-catered 
for.

However, Lorraine is hoping that her work with JD Williams might 
help to change that.

'It's more than just 
creating clothes though, I want to help women realise that they don't 
have to give up on fashion once they hit 50; these days, age should not 
be a barrier to looking terrific' she added.

Lorraine, who is 54, said she had met many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that both flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish.

'As we 
get older our bodies naturally change, and I receive so many questions 
from women who want to feel stylish, but who get frustrated by the lack 
of choice, size and fit on what's out there, and I'm now really excited 
to be able to offer them a stylish solution.'

In 
addition to modelling and designing her own fashion collection, Lorraine
 will be providing JD Williams' customers with regular tips and fashion 
advice through social media, and other communication channels throughout
 the year. 

Chief Executive of N Brown Group plc, Angela Spindler, said that when it came to choosing a brand ambassador, Lorraine Kelly was the perfect fit.

'I can't tell you how excited we all are. When we 
looked at who we'd like to work with on a new collection Lorraine came 
top in all our customer and colleague research. She's aspirational yet 
accessible and always perfectly dressed, the prefect role model,' said 
Angela.

Angela added that they wanted to making fashion less of a stress for the older woman.

'We're 
excited to be able to offer our customers great quality fashion at 
affordable prices. Our mission is to make fashion easy and enjoyable 
regardless of size or age. There's a real gap on the high street at the 
moment, as no one seems to offer the over 50 woman the latest looks that
 are designed to create a comfortable flattering fit.'

Lorraine for JD Williams will be available in sizes ten to 32, with prices ranging from £20 for jewelled jersey top to £150 for an embellished party dress.
