Spirit Airlines forced six passengers off a flight last week because stewardesses were reportedly 'intimidated' when they heard the group speaking Russian.

The passengers, from San Diego, were on their way to an anniversary party in Las Vegas when they were told to leave shortly after taking their seats.

A steward demanded that they leave, saying that the travelers had ignored requests to lower their voices.

No fly zone: These three passengers, from San Diego, were also kicked off the flight because a stewardess allegedly found them 'intimidating'

The group told News 10 that they did not hear requests to keep the noise down.

One of the passengers Sana Bitman, who was kicked off the flight with her husband Dmitry, told the TV station: 'He [the steward] just said, ''This row needs to get up and leave now.'' It was humiliating to be treated that way.'

Among the passengers who were removed from the flight were a business owner, teacher and accountant.

The group said that they were later told by a Spirit Airlines employee that flight attendants had been intimidated when they heard the foreign language.

Grounded: The passengers missed their party and now plan to sue Spirit Airlines

The airline contends that the party had not listened to requests for them to keep quiet.

In a statement to MailOnline, Spirit Airlines said: 'We are conducting a complete review and reaching out to the customers.

'Our preliminary review shows that the customers were asked to deplane for loud and disruptive behavior.'

The passengers now plan to sue the airline.
