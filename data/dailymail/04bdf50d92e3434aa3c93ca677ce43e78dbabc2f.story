HMRC bosses knew about the HSBC tax scandal eight months before the bank's chairman was appointed as a Government minister, it emerged last night.

The agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011.

Labour said it 'beggared belief' that HMRC would not have reported to the Chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion.

Today, HMRC will be grilled over its treatment of tax avoiders. Chief executive Lin Homer and top officials Edward Troup and Jim Harra will meet the Commons public accounts committee.

HMRC was asked to vet Lord Green before his appointment, but only about his personal tax arrangements.

That was despite a formal investigation by HMRC into the HSBC accounts from at least as early as October 2011.

But Downing Street insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when David Cameron made Stephen Green a Tory peer and then trade minister.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the BBC the Government was 'in an utter state of confusion' over the issue.

Accusations: Ed Balls said it 'beggars belief' that HMRC would not have informed the Chancellor in 2011

He said: 'Something on this scale and of this seriousness, in my experience of many years in the Treasury, it beggars belief that HMRC would not have told the Chancellor of this systemic problem. It's also staggering that Lord Green could be appointed to government . . . without apparently anybody discussing whether or not that was appropriate, given these ongoing allegations.'

Mr Cameron has said Lord Green was an 'excellent' trade minister, and ministers insist there is no evidence he was involved in any tax evasion.

The billionaire paedophile friend of Prince Andrew was among HSBC offshore investors named in the leaked account files.

The data links Jeffrey Epstein to several private accounts in Geneva, including one in his own name which held £2.3million.

Epstein, above right, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls, was last month accused of employing teenage ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, who claimed he made her sleep with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Buckingham Palace has denied the Duke of York had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts’ and Epstein has called her claims ‘outlandish and offensive’.

The disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of HSBC’s private banking arm in Geneva known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary.

Miss Roberts, now 31 and a mother of three, has said she met Mr Clinton twice but was never ‘lent out’ to him. She claimed Epstein told her: ‘He owes me some favours.’

Epstein gave $25,000 (£16,400) to the foundation in July 2006, the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14-year-old, the Guardian reported.

Another HSBC Geneva client, restaurateur Richard Caring, transferred $1million to the foundation, seemingly in return for Mr Clinton’s attendance at a charity ball in 2005.

It is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax. The foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully.

Sajid Javid told Channel 4 News there was 'no evidence of any conspiracy'. The culture secretary insisted that HMRC is 'independent of day-to-day government'.

But the revelation that thousands of 'black' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage.

Bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007, but did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities.

Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details.

Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered.

The Guardian reported Dave Hartnett, HMRC's then head of tax, as saying that the taxman was required to 'provide an indication of reputational risk for appointments of peers in relation to their tax compliance history only'.

In a letter to George Osborne yesterday, Labour frontbencher Shabana Mahmood wrote that, if ministers knew about the claims, 'failure to ask probing questions would have to be seen as wilfully negligent. As chairman of the bank, Mr Green would either have been aware of malpractice or, if not, surely questions would arise as to why not.'

Yesterday Downing Street initially said that neither Lord Green, who stepped down as a minister in 2013, nor any other member of the Government, had 'any knowledge that HSBC may have been involved in wrongdoing' until it was reported in newspapers and by the BBC in recent days.

But the comments were at odds with claims by Treasury minister David Gauke, who told the Commons on Monday that information about HSBC had been 'in the public domain since 2007'.

Downing Street later said it had 'no record' that HMRC told ministers about apparent HSBC involvement in 'wrong-doing relating to its Swiss banking arm'. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Treasury select committee that HMRC had not passed on details of the allegations before they appeared in the media.

HMRC chief executive Mrs Homer said the data was given to the tax authority under conditions which stopped it from sharing the information.
