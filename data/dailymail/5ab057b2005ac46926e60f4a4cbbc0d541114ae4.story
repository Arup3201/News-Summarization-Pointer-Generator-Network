Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to scrap the controversial fixed-term parliament act

David Cameron is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the Government's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years.

The minister who oversaw the legislation said it would make it all but impossible for either Mr Cameron or Labour leader Ed Miliband to run a minority government if they fail to win a Commons majority next year - as polls currently suggest is likely.

Mark Harper, speaking ahead of a debate on the issue by MPs, said few had appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which means prime ministers no longer have the power to call an election when opinion polls are favourable.

Instead, they need to win the support of a 'super majority' of two-thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would be handing a decision on timing to his or her opponents. 

Critics say the legislation, cooked up to keep the current coalition together, is therefore a recipe for never-ending coalition government.

Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, who will lead a revolt in the Commons in a debate on Thursday, insisted his party should commit to scrapping the legislation. 

'We've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility,' he said.

'It was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition, supposedly to stop one party walking off, rather than any good constitutional innovation. Five-year parliaments are too long. We should repeal it.'

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Harper, who was in charge of constitutional reform as Nick Clegg's Conservative deputy at the Cabinet Office, and was appointed as work and pensions minister in Mr Cameron's last reshuffle, said: 'In the past, you could run a minority government for a short period of time and then have an election.

'The problem now is that you need to be able and prepared to govern on that basis for an entire five-year parliament. You can't run a minority government for a short period of time and then hold another election. You would either have to do a coalition again, or at the least a formal arrangement that could last for five years with a smaller party.

'I don't think a lot of people have cottoned on to this fact.'

Mr Harper's warning is a blow to senior figures in both the Conservatives and Labour who are determined to prevent another coalition after next year's election, despite polls indicating another hung parliament is likely.

MP Mark Harper said few had appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which means prime ministers no longer have the power to call an election when opinion polls are favourable

Supporters of Boris Johnson have floated the idea of trying to install him as Tory leader in the event of Mr Cameron again failing to win an overall majority, with the intention of running a minority Conservative government and holding another election a few months later.

Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the shadow Cabinet, meanwhile, suggest Labour should not enter coalition with the Liberal Democrats if it emerges as the biggest party but does not secure a majority, also with the aim of calling a rapid second general election in the hope of winning outright.

While this was always possible in the past, Mr Harper said the fixed term parliament law passed by the coalition - designed to be a 'lock' on the Government to prevent either the Tories or the Lib Dems walking and triggering an election - would make such a course politically perilous today.

'You now need to have MPs representing two-thirds of seats - not just the MPs voting - wanting to have an election. If you look at history back to World War Two, that means you would have to have the opposition and the governing party agreeing at the same time to call an election - something not likely to happen.'

Other than gaining the support of a super majority of two-thirds of all MPs, the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence. 

But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held.

'So if you try to run a minority administration, there's then always the chance that somebody else can put together a government,' Mr Harper added.

The minister said that simply scrapping the Act would not be a solution. The old right a Prime Minister had to call an election when he or she wanted was a prerogative power granted by the Queen, and once abolished these cannot be resurrected without new legislation.

'If you simply repeal the Act, you are left in a position where there is no power for anyone to dissolve Parliament,' Mr Harper added.

'You would need detailed legislation setting out new rules. Even if the previous system was better, the idea that you could actually argue as the governing party that it was better to give yourselves the exclusive power to call an election back again, and that everybody else would go along with that... I just can't see it happening.'

The minister said the fixed term parliament reforms that had been introduced were a 'recipe for coalition or for parties winning majorities'.

The suggestion that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some MPs who had not appreciated their long-term implications.

Some senior Tories, including at least two Cabinet ministers, believe Mr Cameron should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in May 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in October of that year.

One Conservative MP sceptical about the coalition said: 'The coalition was a mistake in the first place, and now Cameron and Clegg are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders.'
