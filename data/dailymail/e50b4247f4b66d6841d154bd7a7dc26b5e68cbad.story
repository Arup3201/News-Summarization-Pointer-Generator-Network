A holidaying family stumbled upon a huge 17-foot Burmese python as they picnicked in the Everglades.

The collosal snake, one of the mostly deadly in the world which kills by asphyxiating its victims and swallows dead prey whole, was shot by the Park ranger after it emerged from the bushes.

A video shows the dead snake seeming to go on forever as it is dragged into the open. Those watching comment that they believe it was pregnant - with one adding: 'We really wanted to get it before it laid all its eggs'.

The Burmese python, like the one pictured, was spotted by the family as they picnicked in the Everglades, Florida

The snake was spotted in the Florida beauty spot by the Blount family, from Arkansas.

Bryan Blount said they came across the python about 3pm  on Wednesday and his father, Richard, took the pictures and video of the snake which he sent in to wesh.com.

The park ranger confirmed it was a Burmese python and shot it with a shotgun.

Florida is holding a Burmese python 
hunting contest beginning in January where a grand prize of $1,500 will 
be awarded to the person who kills the most pythons, and $1,000 will go 
to the person who bags the longest one.

But despite the game visitors to Florida and the Caribbean were warned earlier this year to watch out for giant Burmese Pythons after they began moving into areas popular with tourists.

In Florida, the main Burmese Python colony has for decades been 
Everglades National Park in the west of the state and it was hoped that 
the surrounding saltwater lakes and waterways would provide a natural  
barrier to stop them moving east.

But reptile experts found that even newly-hatched pythons - which can grow to 20ft long and weigh 200lbs - can survive in seawater for up to a month.

Although they are not considered a threat to humans, Burmese Pythons are vicious and can eat anything from birds to large mammals.

In October 2011, a 16-foot python was found with a 76lb deer in its stomach after it was shot dead.

A six-foot American alligator was found protruding from the mid-section of a 13-foot Burmese python in the Everglades National Park in 2005. The effort to eat the alligator killed both animals

And in 2005 another Burmese python was discovered split open with a 6ft alligator in its stomach.

Florida’s problem with the reptiles dates back decades and has become so severe that residents have been banned from keeping pythons as pets. 

The cause of the epidemic has been blamed on either importers bringing them in from their native south-east Asia or Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed a number of facilities which were holding thousands of Burmese pythons.
