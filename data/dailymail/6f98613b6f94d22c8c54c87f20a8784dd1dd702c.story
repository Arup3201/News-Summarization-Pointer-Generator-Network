The two Malaysia Airlines' disasters in 2014 have had a 'significant impact' on the numbers of Britons holidaying in Malaysia.

Malaysia has dipped from ninth place last year to 16th this year in a list of best-selling destinations compiled by Kuoni.

In March last year Malaysia Airlines MH370, with 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard, disappeared in the Indian Ocean.

Travel to Malaysia has slipped from ninth in the list to 16th in data released by Kuoni in their projections for long-haul holidays for 2015

The Malaysia Airlines' disasters, including the MH17 that was shot down over Ukraine, has seen the number of Britons visiting Malaysia fall 

Then on July 17 the carrier's flight MH17 was shot down over war-torn Ukraine, with the loss of 298 lives, including 10 Britons.

Kuoni said today: 'The Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash in July last year following the missing plane has impacted significantly on sales (to Malaysia).'

Publishing its long-haul destination report for 2015, Kuoni said the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico and Cambodia were the fastest-growing long-haul holiday destinations for British travellers.

The Dominican Republic moved from 38th place last year to 23rd place in the list of top destinations, while Cuba, at seventh, is at its highest-ever placing. 

Other emerging destinations for 2015 include Ethiopia, which has been added to Kuoni’s 2015 touring programme for the first time, and the Philippines, which are now more accessible with a direct flight from London to Manila. 

The Maldives was once again the top destination, followed by Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka.

Kuoni's managing director Derek Jones said: 'This has been one of the busiest January periods I can remember.

'In our 50th year of operating in the UK market, we can clearly see how travel trends have changed over the decades.

'Destinations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, which were once the domain of backpackers, have become popular for mainstream travellers of all ages who want adventure combined with comfort and style.'

Top of the tree for where Britons will holiday to in 2015 on long-haul trips is The Maldives, and it's easy to see why

Thailand, with its endless white sand beaches and pristine crystal blue waters continues to be a big hit with holidaying Britons

Now in its 50th year of operating in the UK market, Kuoni launched its first trends report in 1980. The annual travel barometer maps the ups and downs of destinations around the world and their varying appeal for British holidaymakers.

This year’s report also tracks changes in the way people research and buy worldwide holidays.

Cambodia, with it's spectacular sites such as Angkor Wat, is going to be a popular travel spot for Britons this year according to research

Although outside the top ten travel destinations for Britons in 2015, the Dominican Republic is becoming much more popular
