Indonesian tourism operators will push Australians to holiday in places other than Bali after fears the party island is being overrun by tourists.

A Balinese travel fair taking place this week will encourage visitors to explore outside of the usual hotspots of Kuta and Seminyak beaches.

But one expert said authorities need to go further and designate Bali as a transit from which tourists would be expected to move on.

Tourism operators are trying to steer more people out of Bali to prevent the party island from being overrun

Nyoman Sukma Arida, of Udayana University, has been warning for 10 years that Bali tourism is approaching saturation, pointing to signs of environmental stress all over the island.

A moratorium on new hotel developments was ineffective, he says, and the government should urgently discuss how to save Bali from its own success.

'I've written that Bali should be used as a hub, as the distributor of tourists all over Indonesia,' Professor Nyoman told AAP.

'When I went to Perth recently, I saw that people there still see Bali as their only option.

'It's just that their knowledge of other places in Indonesia is very limited.'

I Ketut Ardana of the Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies disagrees the sector is growing unsustainably.

'I don't agree with using Bali only as a hub, but I agree that other tourist destinations in Indonesia should be selling in Bali,' he said.

Australian tourists would be prime candidates to visit other destinations in Indonesia, he says, because their average length of stay in Bali is 10 to 14 days, compared to four to five days for Asian tourists and seven days for European tourists.

These concerns come as documentary series What Happens in Bali, airs on Australian television, capturing all of the antics experienced by intrepid tourists of the party island.

One Aussie larrikin on the show that has sparked outrage amongst viewers is former Newcastle rugby player Todd Gisondi who is a self-confessed sex addict.

He claims to have had sex with 100 women since moving to Bali four months ago and has turned his sexual prowess into a job, becoming a gigolo following advice from his own mother.
