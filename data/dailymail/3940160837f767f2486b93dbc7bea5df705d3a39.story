The best basketball player in the world is up for grabs. After guiding the Miami Heat to back-to-back NBA championships, there's now a real possibility that LeBron James could leave south Florida for a new challenge this summer... on a free.

James opted out of the final two years of his £12.3million-a-year contract with the Heat to become an unrestricted free agent. The 29-year-old was joined by Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the other two members of Miami's big three. 

Could you even begin to imagine such a situation in football? Just think of the shockwaves that would be send through the football world if Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta, for example, all decided to opt out of their Barcelona contracts and be open for all.

Up for grabs? LeBron James is free to join any team he wants after opting out of his Miami Heat contract

Peak of his powers: Lionel Messi recently signed a lucrative new contract with Barcelona

There would be a huge scrum from the world's biggest clubs to sign up the superstars. And what about from Barcelona's point-of-view? To see three core members of a team leave without a penny in return.

It's a striking situation, but one the Miami Heat are faced with. The spine of their back-to-back championship winning team are now exploring other avenues.

What's brought about this change? Losing to the San Antonio Spurs in such a one-sided NBA Finals series, and the realisation that the Heat were no longer top dogs. Miami were well beaten, their hopes of three titles in a row dashed, and they recognise they need to strengthen to compete for another championship next year.

Homecoming? One option for James is a return to his first team Cleveland, who drafted him in 2003

Just because James and Co have opted out of their contracts, it doesn't mean they will be leaving Miami this summer. One possible scenario could be that James, Wade and Bosh agree between themselves what contracts they want next season, and how much of the salary cap that NBA teams have to abide by (which will rise to around £37million next season) they chew up. 

But, LeBron might choose another avenue in a quest for more titles. In 2010, he had the big decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team that drafted with the No 1 overall pick in the 2003 draft, to join Miami and it has turned out to be the right decision.

But James wants to be able look back at his career with more than two NBA titles to show for it. The great Michael Jordan won six titles with Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant is a five-time champion with the Los Angeles Lakers. Those are players that James compares with but, at the moment, his trophy cabinet is considerably smaller.

The greatest: Michael Jordan won six NBA championships with his dominant Chicago Bulls team

Modern day legend: Kobe Bryant is a five-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers

Floyd Mayweather - £61.65m

Cristiano Ronaldo - £46.97m

LeBron James - £42.45m

Lionel Messi - £37.99m

Kobe Bryant - £36.11m

Should he decide to leave Miami, James 
could hit the West Coast and join the Los Angeles Clippers, teaming up 
with Chris Paul at the Staples Center. Will the city be big enough for 
both him and Bryant?

Then there's Chicago, who are looking to rebuild their franchise, the opportunity to link up with fellow free agent Carmelo Anthony at whichever franchise they feel like, or maybe even return to his first team and go home back to Ohio by rejoining Cleveland.

Teams can officially negotiate with James from July 1, and not sign him before July 9.

Just imagine if the summer transfer window opened, and Messi had a choice of any club in the world. That is the situation James finds himself in. He is an athlete at the peak of his powers both on the court and in terms of financial power (he was rated as the third highest paid sports star behind Floyd Mayweather and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013), and now he has his future in his own hands. That is the situation every sportsman dreams of.
