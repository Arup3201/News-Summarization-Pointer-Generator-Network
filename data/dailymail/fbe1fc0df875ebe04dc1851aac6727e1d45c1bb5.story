Even the greatest stage needs a memorable performance to bring it alive and Noble Mission delivered an award-winning one on Saturday to produce the most thrilling and emotional victory of the 2014 Flat season on Champions Day at Ascot.

Two years after the great Frankel had ended his career with victory in the Qipco Champion Stakes for the late Sir Henry Cecil, his little brother, trained by Cecil’s widow Jane, lifted the same Group One prize.

For a few strides well inside the furlong, it looked as if jockey James Doyle’s efforts to make all the running would be in vain as Noble Mission was headed by Al Kazeem but the 7-1 shot refused to buckle as he bravely thrust his head back in front.

The cold nuts and bolts of the result are that Noble Mission’s neck success bagged over £770,000 for Lady Cecil’s stable, more than twice the total managed by the rest of her horses in Britain this season.

But this was about much, much more. It was an emotional and overwhelming justification of Lady Cecil’s decision to continue to run her husband’s Warren Place stables in Newmarket.

To suggest a little intervention from above helped lift home the horse he used to train may be overly sentimental but if Sir Henry was looking down on the corner of Berkshire he ruled as a trainer, he would have no doubt done so with contented smile.

Lady Cecil, struggling to hold back the tears, said: ‘I think I am going to wake up and realise that I’ve been dreaming. I was interviewed before the race, which I didn’t really want to do, and I said it would be a fairytale to win and it absolutely is.

‘We knew he was in the form of his life but we hardly dared to dream it could happen. It was a tough race and he toughed it out. 

‘I had my head in my hands. I was so scared he wasn’t going to hang on.’ 

Racing can seem obsessed with making sure it doesn’t accentuate the positive.

It happened again ahead of Champions Day at Ascot. The ground was heavy, not ideal for horses bred to run like the wind, but the going has seemed even tougher for the meeting’s organisers.

As high-profile names headed by dual Derby winner Australia joined the list of absentees, a familiar question surfaced. Is a Saturday in late October the right stage for the most valuable day’s Flat racing in Britain?

Given a blank piece of paper, British Champions Series would choose a different day but British racing’s major meetings must be arranged in conjunction with other European nations, who can veto anything they believe would have an adverse effect on their programmes.

That means moving British Champions Day is a non-runner. But what we are stuck with is not bad. Almost 30,000 spectators were at Ascot to watch 17 Group One winners.

Sure, more needs to be done — Ascot and BCS must see if there is a way to cover the track to shield it from the worst of the autumn weather.

Sir Henry used to raise the family standard above Warren Place whenever he had a Group One winner and it will be flying proudly again this morning as his widow maintains the tradition. 

Lady Cecil, who took over the trainer’s licence when Sir Henry died shortly before 2013 Royal Ascot, certainly has reason to treasure Noble Mission.

Lady Cecil’s first full year in charge has not been easy but Noble Mission has also won two other overseas Group One prizes — the Tattersalls Gold Cup in Ireland and the Grand Prix de Saint Cloud in France.

What the five-year-old now does has yet to be decided by owner Prince Khalid Abdullah but it will be a big surprise if he does not join Frankel at stud.

Doyle appeared to execute a perfectly timed ride to hold off Roger Charlton’s Al Kazeem — a horse he usually rides.

But there was a sting in the tail. He received a £10,000 fine and a seven-day ban for using his whip above the permitted level.

Third was Dermot Weld’s Free Eagle, while 7-4 favourite Cirrus Des Aigles was fifth.

Noble Mission’s win gave British Champions day the big result it needs and one that the Queen’s Estimate was unable to supply. The 2013 Gold Cup winner could not cope with the heavy ground and trailed in last in the Long Distance Cup behind Weld’s Forgotten Rules.

The £240,000 Night Of Thunder’s second place in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes should be more than enough to secure Richard Hannon a first trainers’ title in his first season since taking over from his father.,

Half-length winner was Charm Spirit, ridden by Olivier Peslier and trained by Freddie Head, whose sister landed the Arc a fortnight ago with Treve.
