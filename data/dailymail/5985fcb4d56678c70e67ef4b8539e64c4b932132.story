A U.S. diplomat was expelled from Russia on Tuesday after the Kremlin's security forces said that he tried to recruit a Russian agent.

The FSB counter intelligence service claimed Ryan Christopher Fogle was caught red-handed seeking to recruit a Russian 
intelligence officer.

The Russian agency displayed evidence that they claimed to have found on Fogle including wigs, packets of cash, a knife, map and compass, and a letter promising millions for 'long-term cooperation'.

Seized: Ryan Christopher Fogle was arrested and taken to FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, Moscow, and later handed over to the U.S. embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols

Capture: A man named as Ryan Fogle sits at the receiving office of the Federal Security Service in Moscow on Monday

The FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, identified the diplomat as Fogle, a third secretary at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, detaining him briefly overnight.

It alleged Fogle was a CIA officer trying to recruit a Russian counter-terrorism officer who specializes in the volatile Caucasus region in southern Russia, where the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects had their ethnic roots.

Fogle was handed over to U.S. Embassy officials, declared persona non grata and ordered to leave Russia immediately. He has diplomatic immunity, which protects him from arrest.

The State Department would only confirm that Fogle worked as an embassy employee, but wouldn't give any details about his employment record or responsibilities in Russia.

Some officials also referred inquiries to the CIA, which declined comment.

Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade.

While relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident.

Arrested: The U.S. diplomat - suspected by Russia of being a CIA agent - was named as Ryan Christopher Fogle

Seized: The FSB claimed a third secretary in the political section of the U.S. Embassy had attempted to recruit a Russian secret services official

The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul to appear on Wednesday in connection with the case. McFaul said he would not comment on the spying allegation.

Russian officials expressed indignation the U.S. would carry out an espionage operation at a time when the two countries have been working to improve counterterrorism cooperation.

'Such provocative actions in the spirit of the Cold War do nothing to strengthen mutual trust,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Russia's Caucasus region includes the provinces of Chechnya and Dagestan. The suspects in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings - Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his elder brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a manhunt  are ethnic Chechens.

Tamerlan spent six months last year in Dagestan, now the center of an Islamic insurgency.

U.S. investigators have been working with the Russians to try to determine whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev had established any contacts with militants in Dagestan.

Despite the end of the Cold War, Russia and the United States still maintain active espionage operations against each other.

Last year, several Russians were convicted in separate cases of spying for the U.S. and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences.

But Tuesday's case had espionage elements that seemed more like Spy vs. Spy than Ludlum and le Carre.

Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained

Russian state TV showed pictures of a
man said to be Fogle, wearing a baseball cap and a blond wig, lying 
face down on the ground.

The man, without the wig, was also shown 
sitting at a desk in the offices of the FSB, the Federal Security 
Service.

Two wigs, a compass, a map of Moscow,
a pocket knife, three pairs of sunglasses and envelopes of 500 euro 
notes (each bill worth $649) were among the items the FSB displayed on a
table.

The FSB also produced a typewritten 
letter that it described as instructions to the Russian agent who was 
the target of Fogle's alleged recruitment effort.

The letter, in Russian and addressed 
'Dear friend,' offers $100,000 to 'discuss your experience, expertise 
and cooperation' and up to $1 million a year for long-term cooperation. 
The letter also includes instructions for opening a Gmail account to be 
used for communication and an address to write. It is signed 'Your 
friends'.

'If this is genuine, then it'll be 
seen to be appallingly bad tradecraft - being caught with a 
''How-to-be-a-Spy 101'' guide and a wig.

'He would have had to have been 
pretty stupid,' said Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University 
who studies the Russian security services.

Samuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King's College London, called the evidence bizarre.

Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB

Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB

'I wouldn't have thought that spies 
gave each other written instructions,' he said in a telephone interview.
Greene also noted that the FSB had displayed Fogle's official 
diplomatic ID, suggesting he was carrying it along with the spy 
paraphernalia when he was detained.

'Maybe this is what the CIA has come 
to, maybe the propaganda folks in the Kremlin think we are this stupid, 
or maybe both,' he said.

A five-minute video produced by the 
FSB and shown on state TV showed a Russian official speaking to what 
appear to be three U.S. diplomats who had come to pick up Fogle in the 
FSB office.

The official, whose face is blurred, 
alleged that Fogle called an unidentified FSB counterintelligence 
officer who specializes in the Caucasus at 11.30pm on Monday

He then said that after the officer 
refused to meet, Fogle called him a second time and offered 100,000 
euros if he would provide information to the U.S.

The Russian official said the FSB was
flabbergasted. He pointed to high-level efforts to improve 
counterterrorism cooperation, specifically FBI director Robert Mueller's
visit to Moscow last week and phone calls between President Obama and 
Russian President Vladimir Putin.

'At a time when the presidents of the
two countries are striving to improve the climate of relations between 
the two countries, this citizen, in the name of the U.S. government, 
commits a most serious crime here in Moscow,' the official said.

State Department spokeswoman Jen 
Psaki confirmed that an officer at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was 
briefly detained and released.

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security'

'We have seen the Russian Foreign 
Ministry announcement and have no further comment at this time,' said 
Psaki, who was in Sweden with Secretary of State John Kerry.

Little was immediately known about 
Fogle. A third secretary is an entry level position at the State 
Department, the lowest diplomatic rank in the foreign service.

Putin has stoked anti-American 
sentiments among Russians in recent years in what is seen as an effort 
to build support at home. He also appears to have a genuine distrust of 
Russian nongovernmental organizations that receive American funding, 
which he has accused of being fronts that allow the U.S. government to 
meddle in Russia's political affairs. Hundreds of NGOs have been 
searched this year as part of an ongoing crackdown by the Russian 
government.

Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine

Galeotti said the public exposure of 
Fogle suggests a political purpose behind the detention. He said these 
kinds of spying incidents happen with some frequency, but making such a 
big deal of them is rare.

The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia.

Famously,
10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of 
pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the 
country.

The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S.

In
the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter 
of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was 
shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany.

One
of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an 
American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot.

'More often, the etiquette is that 
these things get dealt with quite quietly — unless they want to get a 
message out,' Galeotti said.

'If you identify an embassy staffer 
who is a spy for the other side, your natural impulse is to leave them 
be, because once you identify, you can keep tabs on them, see who they 
talk to and everything else.'

'There's no reason to make a song and dance, detain them, eject them,' he said.

Greene said Fogle's detention should 
be seen as part of Putin's confrontation with the opposition and not as 
something likely to have a major impact on U.S.-Russia relations.

'I think this is mostly for domestic 
consumption in Russia so that people say, ''look at these naughty 
Americans trying to meddle in our internal affairs and spy on us,''' 
Greene said. 'But everybody's got spies everywhere so I don't see this 
as a major issue.'

In Washington, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell also said the incident was unlikely to hamper U.S.-Russia relations.

'I'm not sure I'd read too much into 
one incident one way or another,' he told reporters, and pointed to 
Kerry's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sweden on
Tuesday evening.

'We have a very broad and deep 
relationship with the Russians across a whole host of issues, and we'll 
continue to work on our diplomacy with them directly.'

Alexei Pushkov, who heads the 
international affairs committee in Russia's parliament, wrote in a 
Twitter post that the spy scandal would be short-lived and would not 
interfere in Kerry and Lavrov's discussions aimed at bridging deep 
differences over the civil war in Syria.

'But the atmosphere is not improving,' Pushkov commented.
