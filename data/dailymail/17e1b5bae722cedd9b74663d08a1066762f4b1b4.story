Thousands gathered this morning to pay their respects to fallen Jersey City police Officer Melvin Santiago, who was killed in the line of duty this week in what has been described as an 'ambush'.

Governor Chris Christie, state Rep Albio Sires and former Gov Jim McGreevey were among those who attended the funeral held this morning at St Aloysius Catholic Church.

Current Mayor Steven Fulop eulogized Santiago at the somber ceremony, calling the 23-year-old rookie his 'hero'.

Outpouring: Thousands of Jersey City residents lined the streets to see the procession of Santiago's cakset to the church

'Melvin Santiago was everything we would want in a police officer. He was hard working and conscientious, good and courageous, strong and considerate,' Fulop said. 'To quote the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., "It was not how these officers died that made them heroes; it is how they lived."'

Fulop referenced an essay Santiago's brother Alex wrote this week titled 'My Hero'.

'Well Alex, Melvin is also my hero and I'm quite certain he's also the hero of quite a few people in this church,' Fulop said.

Fulop led the procession of more than a thousand police officers from McLaughlin funeral home to the church.

Hundreds of residents lined the streets to see Santiago's casket, draped with a flag that flew over the ruins of the World Trade Center, make its way to the church.

Santiago's death has sparked tensions in the divided New Jersey community and led to threats of violence from the Bloods gang, who vowed to get revenge for Santiago's killer's death.

'Watch the news later,' Campbell told a witness just moments before police arrived. 'I'm going to be famous.'

After killing Santiago, other officers returned fire and killed 27-year-old Campbell.

In the aftermath of the shooting, tensions between police and Campbell's community have been risen after the mayor ordered a large makeshift memorial to Campbell torn down overnight.

However, his defiant family put it back up again.

After Campbell's death, his widow Angelique Campbell told News 12 New Jersey that he should have killed more officers if they were planning to shoot him. She later apologized for these comments, however, and added that her husband had recently fallen back into drug addiction and 'got back with the wrong crowd.'

'Both
 families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let 
Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told 
The Associated Press on Tuesday.

'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't
 want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's 
gone, that's it.'

The funeral today was held just two days after local authorities received threats of vengeance from the Bloods gang.

A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.'

An
 internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New 
Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey 
City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police 
officers and law enforcement.

'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.'

It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang.

A
 law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been 
issued following three shootings involving police in the city.

It seems that local authorities are taking the threat seriously since Santiago's wake was heavily patrolled by police officers armed with firearms and even a tank.

At the wake, current MayorFulop honored Santiago by promoting him to the rank of detective 
and awarding him a Medal of Honor. 

Melvin Santiago was everything we would want in a police officer. He was hard working and conscientious, good and courageous, strong and considerate. To quote the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., "It was not how these officers died that made them heroes; it is how they lived.

Melvin had always wanted to be a police officer. I've been told that as a boy he'd travel with his uncle to the precinct to learn about the Jersey City Police Department.

From family and friends, we've learned that Melvin kept that dream alive in his heart and worked diligently in high school and his years in college to qualify as a police officer. And, when the time came to serve, he repeatedly requested to serve in the West District so that he could guard the community which was his home, which was his family.

He was assigned to the West. Captain Mike Kelly describes Melvin as squared away in his work and manner, intent upon learning, and always trying to be better. Mike told me how Melvin would just watch the older guys, watch and learn, that he wanted to bring pride to the West, and bring honor the profession of law enforcement. Kelly would try to encourage Melvin to relax and smile. I personally think that the "Eagles" cap that Melvin wore to work put Mike a bit off.

In the year since Melvin came on the West, he participated in patrols and police work, he chased down perpetrators and arrested them, he was on the front lines of the district and handled everything that came his way. 

And whether it was neighbors' yelling, domestic disputes, or the threat of gun violence, Melvin was intent upon good prevailing over evil, protecting the vulnerable, and order maintained in our community.   

Melvin represented the best of that thin blue line which protects and defends civilized society from the indiscriminate violence which human beings are capable of. 

Melvin understood that serving as a police officer is dangerous, but he also knew that it was the highest calling of service.

And as Melvin's family knows, it was not only his willingness to make the supreme sacrifice, but his daily commitment to service, his quiet, dogged determination to be a force for good, and to give the protection of the law to the entire community -- including those who would tear it down.

Melvin never excused himself from the standards that he was commanded to enforce. The self-discipline and principled behavior, which Melvin always showed, is what makes a police officer so unique, and it is also what makes the brother and sisterhood that is law enforcement so sacred. 

While we ask you to protect and serve us all, we also ask you to hold yourselves to the highest standards, on the job and also in your private lives. This was a part of his service which Melvin approached with a determination which was exceptional even among police officers.

This morning, in this sacred place, we as a community express our eternal gratitude for the life and legacy of Melvin Santiago, and that of all law enforcement.

Last week when Alex wrote an essay about his brother, he expressed his gratitude in the title, "My hero." Well Alex, Melvin is also my hero and I'm quite certain he's also the hero of quite a few people in this church.

As every police officer will honor his memory each time they don the uniform, let all of us take a moment deepen our appreciation for Melvin's life and sacrifice.

Let us also consider our larger struggle to carve out a space of order and security in this world for ourselves and our families.

Melvin's service and sacrifice are a special part of that struggle, and in light of his courage, let us return to it with a renewed determination and commitment which meets his high standards.

May eternal rest grant unto Melvin, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him.

May his soul and all of the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.
