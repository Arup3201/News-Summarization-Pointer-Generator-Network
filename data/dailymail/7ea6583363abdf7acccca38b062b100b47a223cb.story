Inspirational: David Cameron with overall winner, Dr Ronan Moran, 62

They work tirelessly to give their patients the best possible care, going far beyond the call of duty with no thought of reward.

But last night, five of the NHS’s unsung heroes finally got the recognition they deserve.

GP Ronan Moran was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s first Health Hero Awards, in association with Lloydspharmacy and ITV’s This Morning.

He and four other heroes met David Cameron at Number 10 before going on to an awards ceremony and dinner hosted by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford at the Marriott Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square.

Celebrities including Esther Rantzen took a back seat as they listened to the inspirational stories of the men and women who have gone the extra mile for their patients.

All five Health Heroes were nominated by our readers for the prestigious accolade, which aimed to highlight positive and inspiring stories at a time when there are so many reports of neglect and carelessness.

Dr Moran, 62, received his nomination from Greta Armitage. Dr Moran, whose practice is in Feltham, West London, cared for her late husband, John, after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 

In Mr Armitage’s last weeks, Dr Moran would visit the couple at home every day, often late in the evening.

Mrs Armitage said: ‘It was because of this really exceptional support [from Dr Moran] that I was able to fulfil John’s ambition which was to die at home.’

When her husband passed away, Mrs Armitage rang the locum doctor on call as it was late at night. Instead, Dr Moran arrived.

Mrs Armitage described how his presence was a great comfort to her, and how Dr Moran helped wash her husband and change his clothes and bedding.

She said Dr Moran told her he wanted her husband to leave his home with dignity.

That level of service, dedication and care was said to be typical of Dr Moran, described by colleagues as an ‘inspiration’. 

Last night he was presented with the award, and a £5,000 holiday, by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

Accepting it, Dr Moran said: ‘I am very humbled. I think it is a great privilege.’

His fellow heroes included Margaret Cameron, a nursing assistant for dementia sufferers in Doncaster. 

She was nominated by Mary Beardsley, a senior nursing sister, for her dedication and compassion.

At 69 she still works full-time, helping to run three day care centres for dementia sufferers.

Colleagues said her ‘understanding and natural warmth set her apart’ and that patients often ask for her by name when she is not working, despite having severe memory problems.

They said she encouraged her patients to engage in therapies thanks to her ‘strength of personality’, and scoured car boot sales looking for objects to help stimulate her patients.

David Albert, 57, an ear, nose and 
throat surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, was nominated by Cheryl 
Towse, from Essex, for his treatment of her son, Theo. 

She
described how he gave Theo his personal phone numbers, would come in on
his days off to treat him and sing to him when he was  scared.

Ron King, 79, a retired bus driver in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, is a volunteer who takes cancer patients to hospital for treatment. He was nominated by Roger Hilliard, whose father has leukaemia.

Cathy Ryan, 56, a community matron in Southwold, Suffolk, was nominated by Marian Proctor for her work setting up a charity that has improved the lives of countless carers and their patients, including Marian’s mother.

Mr Cameron said: ‘The Awards provide an ideal opportunity to highlight what our National Health Service is about and why we should all be proud of the care it provides.

‘The number of people nominated for the award shows there are unsung heroes dedicated to the task of providing compassionate care in hospitals, surgeries and clinics across the country.’
