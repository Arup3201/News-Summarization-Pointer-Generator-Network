Norway starlet Martin Odegaard was thrown straight in at the deep end during his first ever training session with the Real Madrid first team.

The 16-year-old sensation was paired up with Gareth Bale for a sprinting exercise at the club's training ground on Thursday morning.

The Wales forward was pictured speeding away from the youngster during the drill but later appeared to offer some words of encouragement for Odegaard as he was snapped with his arm around his shoulder.

Norway international Odegaard insists he signed for Real Madrid for sporting reasons, not financial

Position: Attacking midfielder

Clubs: Stromsgodset (2014-15), Real Madrid (2015-

Odegaard is expected to spend the rest of the season playing for Real Madrid's B team Castilla but will train regularly with Ancelotti and the first team players.

The Norway international signed a staggering £40,000 per week contract with the Champions League winners but insisted on Monday his decision to sign for Real was purely a sporting one.

'It [money] has not been an issue at all for me. It was not an issue in my discussions with various clubs,' Odegaard said. 'I chose what was best for me in sporting terms.'

Having visited a number of Premier League sides before deciding to switch to the Bernabeu, Odegaard is set to start his Real Madrid career in the reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla, coached by legend Zinedine Zidane.

'It was a process where I visited several clubs, which was reported. A decision was made after that,' he added. 

'[Zidane is] one of the world's best footballers of all time.'

Meanwhile, Real could face the same transfer ban imposed on Barcelona after Fifa opened an investigation into their signing of under age players. 

The club presented Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva this week just three days after making a huge financial commitment to sign 16-year-old Martin Odegaard and the suspicion in Spain is that the club are preparing for the worst after Fifa’s merciless exclusion of Barcelona from the transfer market for the next 12 months.

The investigation into Madrid focuses on two 12-year-olds brought to Madrid from Venezuela in 2012. Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach River Plate and Milan, Madrid snapped them up via an intermediary who has a soccer school in the Spanish capital.

The first was signed by Madrid in 2012 and the second of the two players signed aged 14 in 2013. He is currently in the youth system of Rayo Vallecano.

Madrid have a month to file all relevant paperwork to Fifa and demonstrate they have not contravened the governing body’s Article 14 whic only allows the signing of Under 18s from outside the EU if the player’s parents have had to relocate to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons.
