Walter Powley, 85, died after suffering severe burns when he fell and became trapped between a wardrobe and a radiator

An 85-year-old grandfather-of-four died from severe burns after falling at his care home and becoming trapped between a wardrobe and a radiator.

Walter Powley was unable to reach the emergency buzzer in his room after he became trapped against an unprotected radiator pipe for several minutes.

Mr Powley suffered severe burns to his legs and died in hospital eight days later.

His care home, Western Park View, in Leicester, was fined £100,000 with £35,000 costs after it admitted breaching health and safety rules.

Mr Powley was only due to be at the care home for a couple of weeks until further arrangements could be made, and was admitted on the advice of an occupational therapist because of his risk of falling.  

His son Colin Powley said: 'We're still devastated not only by our dad's death but also how it came about.

'The fact he died from injuries sustained as a result of, in our view, inadequate care in a place where he was supposedly safer than at home is heart-breaking.' 

The widower was admitted to the home for respite care in May 2012, but Leicester Crown Court heard that four days later, on May 8, the grandfather fell in his room and became trapped.

He was there for several minutes before being discovered by a carer at 7.30am, having suffered severe leg burns from an unprotected pipe and valve below a radiator as well as superficial burns to both legs from hot water leaking from the valve. 

Although the radiator was covered by protective safety insulation, the 70C pipe below it  was not.  

Tim Green, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said: 'The care home failed to insulate the pipe and valve.

'Three of the home's 50 other bedrooms also had similar exposed pipes and it could have been avoided had they assessed the foreseeable risk.'

The care home admitted the failing.

Recorder Roger Evans said: 'Walter Powley's family had every right to expect he was going to be cared for in a safe environment, which it wasn't.

'The exposed pipework was a risk and danger which should never have been allowed.

'I accept [the care home] had a good record for safety and care.

'The defendants were well aware of the 43 degree centigrade limit (the limit recommended in care homes).'

Colin Powley added: 'My dad's stay at Western Park View was only to be for two weeks respite while we explored all the options for his future care.

'We had supported and cared for Dad daily and managed to keep him safe in his own home for six years following a stroke.

'Now we've lost valuable time with our dearly loved dad and his young grandchildren have lost the time to build their relationship and memories of him.

The care home admitted its failing and was fined £100,000 at Leicester Crown Court (pictured)

'We sincerely hope the lessons learned with regard to exposed pipework and acceptable temperatures for hot surfaces in care homes will prevent other families having to experience what we have.' 

Speaking after the case, HSE Inspector Richenda Dixon said: 'Walter's death could have been prevented, had the hot pipes and valves been covered or boxed in.

'This was a foreseeable and a preventable fatal incident.'

The care home issued a statement, saying: 'Western Park View Care Home and our staff were devastated by the tragic death of Walter Powley.

'We operate in a highly regulated industry and are inspected on a regular basis to make sure that we are providing the safest environment to those persons under our care.

'We are very sorry we did not recognise that a short section of exposed pipework underneath the wall hung radiator in the corner of Mr Powley's room presented a danger to him.

'We are grateful that the judge recognised the company's good safety record and that this was not a cost-cutting exercise, rather that this was a case in which the risk went unnoticed. This issue has now been addressed.'
