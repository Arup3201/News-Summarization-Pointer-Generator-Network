James Anderson has had a chastening week but had something to cheer at Lord's on Thursday when he became the highest wicket taker in Test matches in England.

The England opening bowler, charged with a Level Three offence on Tuesday by the ICC following an alleged altercation with Ravi Jadeja at Trent Bridge, had Shikhar Dhawan caught at third slip by Gary Ballance.

This took the Lancastrian on to 230 wickets on home soil, one more than Fred Trueman.

Test wickets in England:

James Anderson - 232 wickets

Fred Trueman - 229 wickets

Sir Ian Botham - 226 wickets

Bob Willis - 176 wickets

Alec Bedser - 167 wickets

Anderson is almost peerless in English conditions and the green top at Lord's will have made his eyes light up on Thursday morning.

The 31-year-old later had Virat Kohli caught behind and surpassed Sir Ian Botham as the highest Test wicket taker at Lord's.

He did not get the chance to bowl at Jadeja but added another wicket when he trapped Stuart Binny in front.

Now Anderson has Botham's England Test record of 383 wickets firmly in his sights.

He will hope that he can make a serious dent in that record in this series, although he could be banned for four Tests if found guilty of pushing Jadeja at Trent Bridge.

James Anderson - 71 wickets

Sir Ian Botham - 69 wickets

Stuart Broad - 64 wickets

Fred Trueman - 63 wickets

Bob Willis 47 wickets

England captain Alastair Cook thinks India's complaint is a tactic to at the very least distract Anderson and possibly to get him suspended.

‘We’re surprised it’s come to the situation it’s come to,’ Cook said. ‘But we can’t let it be a distraction to us. For Jimmy, all the lads can rally around him – he’s a stalwart of our side, an outstanding bowler with a fantastic record.

‘It’s probably a tactic a little bit from India if we’re being honest, and we just can rally around him. Hopefully he can get this ball swinging at certain times in this Test match and Jimmy can let his cricket do the talking.’
