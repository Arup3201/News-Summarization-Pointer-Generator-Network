Case: Nick Venn was unfairly dismissed from his job running security for a company who used their technology to spy on him, a tribunal heard

A security expert has been handed £38,000 in compensation after his bosses used the CCTV system he ran to spy on him before giving him the sack, a tribunal has ruled.

Ex-Army bomb disposal man Nick Venn had worked at the £230 million Princesshay shopping centre in Exeter, Devon, until he was unfairly dismissed after three years there.

The 51-year-old earned commendations from the police and planned security for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee visit but then fell out with his bosses at Europa Facility Services Ltd.

They wrongly used CCTV to monitor his movements, but were unable to find him doing anything wrong, it emerged during the case.

Mr Venn told his employment tribunal that his problems started when a fellow security worker made threats against him because of an issue over paternity leave.

'It came to my attention that X had threatened to go to the local gypsy camp to pay people to beat me up, wreck my car and burn my house down. Naturally I was extremely concerned by these threats and accordingly reported them,' he said.

He said there was no investigation by the company, Europa Facility Services Ltd, into his allegation, the worker was not suspended and so Mr Venn reported the matter to the police a week later.

The tribunal judge ruled that the outcome of this was that Mr Venn was himself 'on the wrong end of the disciplinary procedure' and suspended from work before he was sacked in February 2013.

The worker X made counter allegations which 'were then pursued to the exclusion of the original complaint', said the judge.

Mr Venn claimed unfair dismissal and the judge ruled that it was not a fair dismissal and awarded him the £38,000 compensation.

He had told the tribunal that his former bosses said that most of the security team were 'useless' and 'needed replacing'.

He said: 'I was held responsible for acting on a "hit list" compiled by the company

'Despite the pressure from management to dismiss security officers for little more than their face was not fitting, I ensured that I only investigated where there were credible issues to be investigated.'

He said the 20 strong team gave him the nickname 'hatchet man' but said most of the people on the hit list were still working there when he was sacked.

Mr Venn said he suffered ill health after his sacking and said his marriage almost broke down due to the financial strain.

He said: 'I went from hero to zero. My name ended up on that his list. There was a culture of getting rid of people. There was massive turnover of staff, crazy dismissals.'

His Exeter based solicitor Terry Falcao who represented him at the tribunal which Europa Facility Services Ltd did not attend, said: 'Europa's senior management failed to act when he blew the whistle on a subordinate who made serious threats to assault him and to burn his house down.

'Instead management pursued trivial complaints against him by one of his subordinates, misused the CCTV in Princesshay to spy on him and other employees and unjustly dismissed him.

'This was a very difficult year for my client who was brave enough to take on and win a claim against a company employing 4,500 workers and turning over £180million.

'He lost his career and his life was turned upside down. Yet Mr Venn was by all accounts a model employee.'

Europa Facility Services Ltd has so far failed to comment.
