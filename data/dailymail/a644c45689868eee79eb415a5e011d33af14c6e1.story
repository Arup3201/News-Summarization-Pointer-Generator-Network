A blistering review of Guy Fieri's new Times Square restaurant is having a surprising effect - transforming the chef's ailing venture into the hippest spot for 'ironic dining' among New York locals.

Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, a massive 500-seat venue  in Times Square, has been doing a busy trade, according to reports.

Last month New York Times food critic Pete Wells slated the restaurant with a harsh review which asked: 'Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?' and deemed a margarita a 'combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde'.

The ironic choice: Guy's American Bar & Kitchen in Times Square has had crowds of New Yorkers eating there to decide for themselves if a scathing review was really true

However rather than sink the latest venture of millionaire restaurateur Fieri, the review has hard-to-please New Yorkers flocking through its doors to sample the cuisine - albeit in an ironic manner. 

Locals have been venturing into 
the touristy, midtown hub to eat at Guy's place on West 44th Street, checking themselves in on Facebook, Twitter and FourSquare while uploading pictures of food and cocktails to Instagram.

Alex Brena, 24, who works in advertising sales and lives on the Lower East Side, went a week after the Times review ran with two friends who also live in New York.

Miss Brena told MailOnline she went to the  restaurant mid-week for lunch and described it as 'busy but not packed'.

She said although there were tourists, other people appeared to have gone to sample the food following the review with 'lots of pictures being taken'.

The group shared appetizers of fries, mozzarella sticks, tacos and wings. Miss Brena told MailOnline that the fries were the 'weirdest' as they were covered in hot sauce, had no potato in them and were just the shell.

The mozzarella sticks were 'fine' while the tacos and wings were 'nothing special but edible'.

She added: 'It's a lot of fried food and hot sauce. I didn't feel too good after leaving.'

Guy Fieri is a one-man brand of books, merchandise and TV shows who also co-owns five restaurants in California.

Unknown until 2006 when he won the second season of The Next Food Network Star, Mr Fieri now ranks as the 10th highest paid chef in the country, according to Forbes.

However his first solo venture in New York, which opened in September, has been such a flop 
that one Uproxx reviewer said: 'If Kris and I die of food poisoning 
you’ll know that these did us in,'  referring to the Sashimi Tacos.

In the New York Times, Mr Wells questioned whether Mr Fieri, 44, deserves his chef credentials and widespread praise from cable network fans.

He asks in a roll-out of blistering questions: 'When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WELCOME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads?

'Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?

'What exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes Guy’s Famous Big Bite Caesar (a) big (b) famous or (c) Guy’s, in any meaningful sense.'

And finally: 'Hey, did you try that blue
drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita?
Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and 
formaldehyde?'

The scathing review attracted so much attention that Fieri appeared on the Today Show to defend himself.

He said: 'To me it's impossible to 
come in and have a dining experience and have every single thing wrong, 
unless you come in with a different agenda and you want to 
sensationalize something and you want to blow it out of the water.'

Fieri added that the food critic had gone 
'overboard' to raise his own profile but did admit that his restaurant 
needed some fine tuning.
