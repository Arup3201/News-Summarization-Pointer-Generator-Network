With her flawless tanned skin and a perfect smile, Kim Kardashian has become a poster girl for Hollywood.

And although she has confessed to 
having Botox and was filmed doing so for an episode of Keeping Up With 
The Kardashians, she denies ever having had surgery, claiming that her 
looks come courtesy of good genes, expensive beauty products and a great team of make-up artists.

But what if Kim didn't have the luxury of all the beauty products and stylists that fame brings with it?

Just your average girl: A design team decided to create what they think Kim Kardashian would look like if she wasn't famous - and the results are startling

One company decided to look into what some of the
 biggest celebrities would look look like if they hadn’t found fame - and the team of hair stylists, make-up artists, plastic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package.

The design 
team created some concept images 
using existing pictures of a selection of Hollywood celebrities showing 
what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world.

The design team focused on features on 
the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally 
worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his pearly Hollywood smile and Kim and her 
perfectly shaped eyebrows.

Not such a bad gal now: Rihanna looks fresh-faced and innocent in the design team's 'non famous' version of the singer

Sharon, is that you? Mrs O, who has admitted to having plastic surgery, looks much older with her grey hair and winkles in the images

The best makeunder of the bunch is undoubtedly 33-year-old Kim Kardashian. With her dark rimmed spectacles, blotchy skin and bushy brows, the star is virtually unrecognisable.

Rihanna too has been treated to a believable transformation.

Images of Nicholas Cage, Tom Cruise and Sharon Osbourne, meanwhile, are slightly more ridiculous.

Tom Cruise and his crooked teeth resemble a hillbilly, while 50-year-old Nicholas Cage looks almost double his age with a bald head and wrinkled skin.

Taking it too far: The design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his perfect teeth

Haggered: Nicholas Cage, 50, looks old beyond his years in the virtually adapted image

Speaking about their work, www.vouchercodespro.co.uk, who helped create the images, said: 'Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips?

'No wonder the A-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the Hollywood elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet. 

'This got us thinking, what would some of the biggest celebrities look
 like if they hadn’t become famous? Would they even still look 
recognisable without the teams of hair stylists, make-up artists, 
plastic surgeons and fashion consultants?.'
