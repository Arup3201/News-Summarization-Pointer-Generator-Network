I had mixed emotions at the end of Glasgow Warriors’ victory over Montpellier on Sunday. The main feeling was one of disappointment that Glasgow didn’t gain the bonus point after failing to get over the line for a fourth try. But it just proves how far the side have progressed that a convincing win over a top French side is regarded as a disappointment.

They dominated large parts of the game and really should have got the bonus point - but maybe not by the way they went about it.

Game management is vital; it is what all stand-offs need to be good at as it falls to them to ensure their team plays in the right areas of the pitch.

But game management comes from the leadership within the team, too, and this is where I felt Glasgow got things wrong in the first half.

Everyone knew they needed to win the game by scoring four tries to give themselves a better chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals - and the intent was there at the start of the game.

It worked initially as they got the first try after 12 minutes but it was what happened next that was the problem. They squandered many kicks at goal, choosing to kick to touch and try to get more tries, but they just didn’t come.

It is a nightmare scenario for Josh Strauss as captain because, once you have made the decision to go for the tries, and they don’t come, what do you do next? Keep going or revert to kicking the points?

Glasgow kept going but their accuracy and execution let them down. In ideal conditions for throwing in, the lineout malfunctioned, which didn’t provide any platform.

The irony is that last week against the Scarlets, with a howling crosswind, the lineouts were impeccable. That made yesterday’s display more surprising.

When you chase the tries early, well before the game is actually won, it changes not just the tactics used but also the mindset of the team. This may be one of the reasons that the lineout didn’t function properly; they were thinking about how they were going to score before they had secured the ball first.

The reality is that if they had scored one more try before half-time, everyone would have been happy but they didn’t and these are the fine margins that you need to deal with at this level.

Glasgow scored the third try with 10 minutes to go, so they had a chance to make it a successful day all round but they just could not find that spark to get the all-important fourth.

Bonus points are key to qualifying for the knockout stages and, especially in the early rounds, you don’t know how important they will be if you miss one until you get down to the business end of the process.

They will definitely have to beat Bath at the Rec and, depending on other results, they might now need to win with four tries - much harder.

They might also have to do this without their captain and talisman Strauss, who was stretchered off on Sunday and it didn’t look good.

Meanwhile, Edinburgh missed a golden opportunity to qualify for the knockout stage of the Challenge Cup with one game to spare when they narrowly lost to Lyon in France.

All is not lost as, if they beat Bordeaux Begles next week at Murrayfield, they will top the group and be in the quarter-finals. Edinburgh have shown huge improvement over the last month or so and I expect them to win that game next week.
