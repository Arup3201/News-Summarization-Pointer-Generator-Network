He only just found out about the baby: Adrian Peterson receives a hug Friday from an unidentified person during an NFL football practice

Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson first met his recently deceased son while he was on life support after the beating that eventually claimed his life.

It has been revealed that the NFL star only learned of the child as recently as two months ago after the boy’s mother started having paternity tests done to try to find his father.

Once told of the young boy, Mr Peterson didn’t even question the possibility he was the father, instead offering to help any way he could, according to TMZ.

The now-married footballer was actually planning a trip to South Dakota to visit his son later this month, sources told the site.

When word of the vicious assault on the boy reached the former MVP, Mr Peterson was on the soonest flight to Sioux Falls that he could find, the site reported.

Word of Mr Peterson's link to the beaten child surfaced after reports he missed practice to attend to a personal matter came to light.

Unfortunately, Mr Peterson’s only contact with his son came while he lie in bed dying from a beating that came at the hands of Joseph Patterson, the mother’s boyfriend.

Mr Peterson has never met the man, the site said.

The running back plans to suit up for Sunday’s home game against the Minnesota Vikings.
