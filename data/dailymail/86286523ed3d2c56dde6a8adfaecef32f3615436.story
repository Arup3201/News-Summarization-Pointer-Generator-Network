Guests at formal dinners may be accustomed to seeing napkins folded into attractive designs.

But this talented artist can manage much more than a few stylish swans.

Joan Sallas, 47, takes table service to another level with his fantastical sculptures of mythical beasts and mountain ranges.

The Catalan artist - the world's leading authority on historic linen folding - has created a vast landscape of intricate folded fancies for his first UK display in Bath.

The centrepiece is an elegant pagoda and fountain, flanked by a griffin and a lion rearing up on their hind legs.

Turkey dinner: Each piece is based on original designs from the banqueting tables of Renaissance Europe

Nice curves: A three-metre-long snake will also form part of Joan Sallas's first UK exhibition

A mountain range made out of linen. Mr Sallas says much of the interest lies in 'deciphering the fold'

It is surrounded by a seven-metre-long display, including a 3m snake, elaborate peacocks, turkeys, crab, turtle and a medley of vegetables.

The unusual designs would all have graced the tables of courts and high-society gatherings competing to have the grandest feasts across Europe from the 14th-17th Century.

Mr Sallas's only guides are old engravings and documents describing imperial and royal banquets.

The 'virtuoso folder' has almost single-handedly revived the extraordinary art, which first appeared in Renaissance Italy and reached its zenith in German speaking lands in the 1600s.

He and his assistant are now hard at work constructing the dazzling array of spectacular structures.

There are eight folding techniques - including fans, rolls and lilies - which Mr Sallas used as keys to decode the historic works.

Turtle: Mr Sallas learned to fold from his grandfather, and believes the skill is therapeutic

The remarkable creation will go on display at the Holburne Museum in Bath, on Saturday.

It will be the first time that such an exhibition has been held in the UK and the first time Mr Sallas has worked here.

'The heart is not the objects that are here on display but the research,' said Mr Sallas, according to AFP. 'My favourite piece is always the one I haven't deciphered yet, the one I don't know how to fold yet.'

But he has no difficulty with discarding his dirty linen at the end of a show.

'This ephemeral quality is part of life,' he added. 'We are only here for a short time.'

Mr Sallas, who is also a cartoonist and makes his own folded creations, learned to foldhttp://molwps.andweb.dmgt.net/begin.html# paper from his grandfather as a child, and the passion stayed with him.

He now teaches in prisons and schools, believing that folding paper and fabric can be therapeutic.

The artist's elaborate designs will be shown in the Holburne’s grand 7.5m long table 
display in the Ballroom Gallery amongst the Museum’s decorative arts 
collection.

The Folded Beauty show will then move to Waddesdon, near Aylesbury in Bucks, in May.

The Holburne Museum said: 'Located in this beautiful space, the 
scale of the linen creations will vividly recreate the drama of the 
dining experience in the Baroque age and will relate to our 16th 
and 17th-century ceramics and silver.'
