This is the moment a wild grey seal appeared to be enjoying a hilarious joke - as it was photographed laughing uproariously.

The image was taken at St Mary’s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, by local amateur photographer David Renney, 54.

Although the animal appears to be doubled up in laughter, it is probably just yawning as, despite their incredibly expressive faces, seals do not outwardly exhibit human emotions such as joy, sadness or amusement. 

Mr Remney, who regularly takes photographs of wild animals in the area, said the wild seal had only just woken up and was resting on rocks close to the lighthouse when he took the photograph.

Seals are a common sight on the coastline near Whitley Bay, with several hundred estimated to live in the area.

Last summer lifeboats and divers from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue organisation were called in to help an underweight seal pup which got into trouble. The public has previously been warned to stay away from the wild seals during the autumn mating season.
