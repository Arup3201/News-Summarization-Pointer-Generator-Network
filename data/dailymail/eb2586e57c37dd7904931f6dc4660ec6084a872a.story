Cumbersome and slow cash machines with clunky buttons and tiny hard-to-see screens could soon be a thing of the past thanks to a range of next-generation ATMs.

Ohio-based security firm Diebold has created a touchscreen cash machine that works like a tablet computer, uses facial recognition and QR codes to identify and authenticate users, and has built-in safety cameras.

While German-based engineers at Wincor Nixdorf have developed a machine that remembers the user's withdrawal history to offer more personalised options.

Ohio-based security firm Diebold has created a cash machine that works like a tablet computer, pictured. The touchscreen ATM connects to smartphones by scanning QR codes, or uses facial recognition technology, instead of bank cards

Diebold's ATM connects to a user's mobile device when they scan an onscreen 
QR code. 

This syncs the device through a cloud-based service and is able to confirm the user's identity without a bank card. 

The transaction screen then appears on the smartphone screen and the customers can select withdrawal amounts.

A unique one-time code is sent to
 the phone, which the customer must enter into the ATM to authenticate the 
transaction and get their money. 

Diebold's ATM can also set up a transaction in advance to make it possible to can send money to a third person.

The 
customer inputs the payment amount and the recipient's contact information, 
which can be selected directly from his or her contact list.

The 
recipient then receives a one-time code he or she can use at an ATM or 
branch to receive money.

This will let users send cash to their children, for example, when travelling or away from home.

These ideas are just some of the concepts recently showcased at the ATM conference in London.

The tablet-inspired cash machine has been developed by security and software company Diebold.

The Millennial design looks and acts like modern smartphones and tablets, with similar navigation menus and controls. 

It is paperless, and receipts are sent via text message or email to a user's phone. 

The first ATM Diebold demonstrated at the London conference - originally debuted at CES in Las Vegas in January - connects to a user's mobile device when they scan an onscreen QR code. 

This syncs the device through a cloud-based service and is able to confirm the user's identity without a bank card. 

The transaction screen then appears on the smartphone and the customers can select withdrawal amounts.

Diebold's second demonstration showcased how the ATM can set up a transaction in advance that can send money to a third person.

The 
customer inputs the payment amount and the recipient's contact information, 
which can be selected directly from his or her contact list.

The 
recipient then receives a one-time code he or she can use at an ATM or 
branch to receive the cash. 

After a user scans the QR code on the Diebold machine, it syncs with the mobile device through a cloud-based service. A unique code is then sent to the phone by text message, which the customer must enter into the ATM to see the transaction screen, pictured

Diebold's portable touchscreen ATM is two-thirds of the size of a traditional cash machine and is Wi-Fi enabled.

A
 built-in camera lets users see who is behind them while they withdraw their cash and facial recognition could also be used as an alternative to the QR code.

The company hopes to bring the ATM to market in the next 18 months.

Another concept was showcased by German firm Wincor Nixdorf .

Chief Technology Officer Reinhard Rabenstein told the BBC that it is no longer acceptable for people to have to wait for their cash.

The Wincor Nixdorf ATM displays a customer's personal 'profile' each time they enter their bank card.

It shows their most recent transactions, including amounts, and personalises the options available to suit this history.

For example, if a customer regularly withdraws £20, this amount will be the first option presented to them.  

Wincor Nixdorf is also said to have created its own app store to work with mobile payments.

Other ATM prototypes included machines with live link video screens to put them in direct contact with customer services, as well as drive-through cash machines which are already available in the U.S.
