This extraordinary flower is almost identical to children's cartoon character Shrek - with its green 'skin', horns and brown waistcoat.

The rare orchid looks as if it is giving a huge grin with outstretched arms, just like the misanthropic ogre who reveals a secret soft side in the beloved film series.

The flower, called Ophrys Apifera or bee orchid, was pictured in Spain by British photographer David Chapman.

The truth: the Orphys Apifera is named for its resemblance to a bumblebee

The university lecturer from Cornwall caught sight of the remarkable flower while out walking through the Pyrenees.

The 48-year-old, who is also a wildlife photographer and writer, spotted the orchid in a book years ago and had been hoping to see one for real ever since.

'This is a very special species of flower, I remember having seen them in my wildflower guidebooks and longed to see one in the flesh,' he said.

'When I first saw one I was amazed by how clever their mimicry is and how beautiful the flowers are.

'Despite the bee orchid being very colourful it is extremely difficult to spot because it is tall and thin and grows amongst tall grasses.'

David has also snapped the orchids in the UK - although they are harder to find here.

He said: 'The quirkiest location I have photographed them is on a roundabout on the A30 near Hayle in Cornwall.

'It is thought that they grow there because their seeds were imported when soil was brought in to make the road embankments.

'I've never found bee orchids in the UK without prior knowledge, as they are quite rare - but I have found them on the north coast of Spain.'

The flower gets its name from its resemblance to a bumblebee, which is thought to entice insects to land on it and transfer its pollen to other plants.
