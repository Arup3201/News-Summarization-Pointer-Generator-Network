A disorientated swan brought rush hour traffic to a standstill on a motorway today after losing its way in thick fog.

The hapless bird landed in front of a shocked female driver on the M9 near Linlithgow early this morning.

Cars were left queuing behind the male swan, which is thought to have become confused by the fog as it made its way to Linlithgow Loch, as it waddled around the carriageway for around 30 minutes.

In a bit of a jam: The confused swan waddled down the middle of the M9 motorway during the morning rush hour today after losing its way in thick fog

Bizarre scene: Cars were left queuing up behind the swan, which wandered around the carriageway for around 30 minutes before it was eventually rescued

Animal protection officers from the Scottish SPCA dashed to the scene, halting traffic to allow officer Connie O'Neill to rescue the bird.

Drivers watched as she and a team of rescuers managed to herd the dazed bird off the busy carriageway and onto the embankment, before bundling it safely into their van.

The swan is now safely back in the waters of its original destination, Linlithgow Loch.

Queues: Drivers stuck in traffic watched as Scottish SPCA officer Connie O'Neill gathered up the swan and carried it across the carriageway to safety

Ms O'Neill said: 'I was called to rescue a swan which landed in front of a car on the M9 at Linlithgow earlier this morning.

'The bird was on the central reservation when I arrived but it ran back onto the motorway when I tried to catch it.

'Thankfully, I was able to rescue the swan before it came to any harm and its been released at Linlithgow Loch.

Rescue: The Scottish SPCA was called to the scene where the swan caused traffic chaos on the motorway at rush hour

Operation: When animal protection officers arrived the swan had waddled onto the central reservation

All in a flap: The swan darted back onto the motorway when officers tried to catch it, but they managed to shoo the bird onto the embankment

'Itâ€™s possible the thick fog this morning caused this bird to become disorientated and land on the busy motorway,' she said.

Ms O'Neill said the female driver 
who reported the swan after it swooped down and landed in front of her 
car was so relieved to hear it had been rescued she burst into tears.

The
swans at Linlithgow Loch are a popular tourist attraction for visitors 
to Linlithgow Palace, the birthplace of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Lost: Connie O'Neill captured the swan and released it back in to the waters of Linlithgow Loch in Scotland

Safe and sound: The officer said the woman who reported the swan on the motorway cried with relief upon learning it had been rescued
