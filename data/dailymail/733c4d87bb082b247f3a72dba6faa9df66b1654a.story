Scrooge, this man is not.

Sammy Nahas, 38, from Staten Island, New York has told how he's splashed $60,000 on Christmas decorations alone this year, stuffing his home with hundreds of over-sized ornaments and adorning it with thousands of lights.

He revealed to TIME.com that the obsession took off after his divorce three years ago and it helps spread cheer at an otherwise depressing time of year. 

A nativity scene appears in his garage doorway with Wise Men and a lamb surrounding baby Jesus.

New interest: His obsession with festive decor took off after his divorce three years ago

Inside Nahas' house there are dozens of larger-than-life characters cluttering the place, including giant snowmen, nutcrackers and a life-size Santa Claus.

Nahas admits that it's 'hard' living in such a tight space but it's all worth it. 

'You wait 365 days for this one day. Jesus is born, family comes over, you eat like pigs, you’re merry, it’s a good day,' he exclaimed. 

The divorcee's extravagant display takes a year of planning and this year, he tied down final preparations in November. 

Packed: Inside Nahas' home there are hundreds of over-sized ornaments, which can be hard to manoeuvre

Year-long project: There are also thousands of lights - luckily Nahas works as an electrician 

Festive display: Nahas says he has around 50 animated figures outside along with up to 15,000 lights

Nahas turns his lights on every night around dusk and welcomes the public to have a look around. 

'If I am home you are welcome to come in and see where the real good stuff is kept!' he writes on Facebook.

He says he has around 50 animated figures outside along with up to 15,000 lights. 

In total, he converts four  rooms in his property into festive grottos.

Luckily Nahas works as an electrician so he can fix any broken circuits. 

Obsession: He estimates that over the years he's spent close to $400,000 on Christmas decorations

'It’s like Harley Davidson meets Christmas,' Nahas said, likening his festive obsession it to a manly hobby

Open to all: Visitors are welcome to stroll around Nahas' home and garden 

He estimates that over the years he's spent close to $400,000 on Christmas decorations.  

'It’s like Harley Davidson meets Christmas,' Nahas said, likening his festive obsession it to a manly hobby.

'Would I picture me doing this? No. I sew for God’s sake. If you asked me ten or 15 years ago if I could sew, I’d say you were out of your mind.' 

No doubt, next year will be bigger and brighter for Nahas. 

He says his young niece is the biggest fan of his work.
