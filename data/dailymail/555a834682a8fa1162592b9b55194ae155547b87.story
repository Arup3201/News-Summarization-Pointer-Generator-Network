Jailed: Cresentla Ragonton was today sentenced to two years in prison for stealing 'Study for Light' by Ed Ruscha from her employer

A housekeeper who stole a £100,000 painting from an Italian financier in a bid to clear her debts and renovate her 'cold' house was jailed for two years today.

Cresentla Ragonton, 58, took the ‘Study for Light’ by Ed Ruscha from the Belgravia home of Giuseppe Ciardi in central London.

She tried to sell the artwork at top auction house Bonhams, with an estimated price of £80,000 to £100,000, but police intercepted the sale before it could take place.

Southwark Crown Court heard the Filipino cleaner needed cash to clear her debts and also had designs on a refit of her own home.

Guy Saul prosecuting said: ‘She removed the painting which was valued at the amount mentioned, and put the painting to be auctioned at Bonhams.

‘When she was arrested, she claimed to have debts of £15,000 and also said she wanted to renovate her house because it was very cold.’

Ragonton worked as Mr Ciardi’s housekeeper at his home in Chester Square, Belgravia, for six years, and would often look after his children, the court heard.

Mr Ciardi, 59, who made his fortune as the founder of hedge fund Park Place Capital, bought the art work in New York in 2004 for $65,000.

Before founding Park Place in 1992, he was a Partner in BNP’s Investment Group and Lazard Brothers’ Capital Markets Group - Global Equities.

He began his career at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York in 1980.

His wife Alexandra was tragically killed in 2005 when she was hit by a speed boat while on holiday in Sardinia.

She was swimming to join her husband on a boat at Calle de Volpe, near to the ‘millionaires’ playground’ of Porto Cervo.

Their three children all witnessed the tragedy.

Ragonton, who has lived in the UK for six years, stole the painting on August 6 this year.

The court heard there was ‘no actual loss’, because the painting was recovered before it could be auctioned off.

Ragonton, from Canning Town, east London, admitted one count of theft.
