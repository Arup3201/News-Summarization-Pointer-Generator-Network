EA Sports continued their countdown of the best FIFA 15 players on Friday night, with Wayne Rooney, Neymar and Angel Di Maria all entering the list in places 30-21.

Manchester dominated this section of the line-up, with two players from each of the Premier League giants represented.

£60 million United man Angel Di Maria (25) and Wayne Rooney (23) stand for the red half, while Sergio Aguero (24) and Yaya Toure (22) are the Manchester City players in this stage of the list.
