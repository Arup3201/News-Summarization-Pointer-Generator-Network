Two former Syracuse ball boys filed a suit saying that both the wife of the team's former assistant coach Bernie Fine and another coach’s wife regularly had sex with players.

Accuser Bobby Davis, 40, has previously said that Laurie Fine initiated sex with him when he was 18 years old, but in the latest court filing, he goes a step further and says that it was well-known that she had sex with a number of basketball players while her husband worked as one of their coaches.

She was also heard talking with the wives of other assistant coaches about performing oral sex on the boys, as well as evaluating their 'specific size and physical attributes'.

Telling it all: Bobby Davis (right) recorded his conversation with Laurie Fine (left) when she said that she knew Bernie molested boys but she didn't do anything, and Davis just detailed her sexual history in the affidavit

Mr Davis details a number of Mrs Fine’s affairs with the students in an effort to show that it was commonly known that players were sleeping with the coaches’ wives throughout Jim Boeheim’s tenure as head coach.

Apparently Mrs Fine's relationships evolved in a similar pattern with each young man, as she would begin by paying them special attention and doing them favors like washing their laundry or lending them her car.

She also gave them money and jewellery, and turned their special bond into 'an intimate relationship'.

Mr Davis tells the specific stories of Mrs Fine’s trysts with four unidentified players- not including his own personal sexual encounter with her- in which he would drive Fine to the players’ campus housing units.

In the first assignation listed in the affidavit, Mr Davis drove Mrs Fine to Player 1’s house and he saw her go into his dorm room.

Mr Davis ‘later saw Player 1 come out fist-pumping the air and bragging about how he had just had sex with Laurie.’

This is just the first of four specific relationships that Davis describes in the affidavit, and he says it was common knowledge that the coaches wives were not off-limits for the basketball players.

'Players used to joke openly about it as a
known fact - that Laurie Fine gave (good oral sex) and was great in 
bed, and that anyone could 'do the coach's wife,’ The New York Post 
reports regarding the affidavit.

Mr Davis continues by saying how often he would drove Mrs Fine and another- unidentified- coaches’ wife to a student housing unit where at least two players lived, who are called Player 2 and Player 3 in the court records.

During the car rides, the two women discussed different players’ sexual preferences, and evaluated their respective partner’s physical attributes.

Though Mr Davis never explicitly knew that Mrs Fine had a sexual relationship with the final young man, Player 4, though he believes that she did ‘because of the way she acted with him’.

In spite of all the focus on Mrs Fine in the filing, the true target of the lawsuit is Coach Boeheim.

The drama started when assistant coach 
Bernie Fine, 66, was fired in November after ESPN released a taped 
conversation it had obtained between Mr Davis and Laurie Fine in which 
Laurie said that she knew that her husband molested his players but she 
did not do anything about it.

Drawn in: The lawsuit charges Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim (pictured) with defaming Bernie Fine's accusers by calling them money-seeking liars

The two accusers in this suit- Mr Davis and his stepbrother Michael Long- say they were forcibly touched multiple by Bernie Fine in the 1980s.

Syracuse administrators immediately fired
Bernie Fine in November after ESPN released the nearly decade-old 
tapes, but Mr Boeheim publicly defended his former assistant, saying 
that his accusers were liars and simply bringing the topic up to make 
money.

'Players used to joke openly about it as a
known fact - that Laurie Fine gave (good oral sex) and was great in 
bed, and that anyone could 'do the coach's wife,’

-according to the affidavit

'I believe Boeheim deliberately chose to ignore what he knew was improper behavior, or actually knew precisely what was happening and did nothing to intervene,' Mr Davis writes in the affidavit.

By bringing the widespread nature of 
the rumors about Laurie Fine's sexual activities with players into the 
legal field, the accusers are undoubtedly hoping to discredit Mr 
Boeheim's defense that he did not know about the sexual abuse that was 
going on.

Because Mr Davis 
and all of the other players mentioned were 18 years old when they had 
sex with Laurie Fine, she cannot be accused of statutory rape.

'It is not only Fine’s relationship with 
me and other boys that would have tipped Boeheim off. For years, Bernie 
Fine’s wife Laurie Fine had sexual relationships with basketball team 
players. Players used to talk openly about it as a known fact,' the 
affidavit continues.

New focus: Her husband was the original focus of the police investigation, as they are seen going through Bernie Fine's bags, but now the relationship Laurie Fine (left) had with players is cause for concern

Another controversy surrounding the suit is the location of the inevitable trial.

Gloria Allred, the lawyer for the accusers- Mr Davis and his stepbrother Michael Lang- filed the defamation suit in New York State Supreme Court which is in Manhattan.

Mr Boeheim wants the trial to take place in Onondaga County upstate, which is where he lives.

The accusers fear that there is too much support for the Syracuse coaches there and if the trial were to take place in the school's backyard, they feel they would not be given equal treatment.
