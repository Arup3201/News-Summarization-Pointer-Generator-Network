A teenager who holds a world record for eating 10 cheeseburgers in under two minutes and trains for his sport by eating 50 Weet-Bix in one sitting is on a mission to be the best competitive eater on the planet.

Isaac Harding-Davis, from Ourimbah, on the New South Wales Central Coast, said he has always been a big eater - with the 90kg, 185cm tall boxer and rugby player claiming to be 'always hungry'.

But it wasn't until the 18-year-old entered an eating competition at his local Lone Star restaurant just over a year ago that he realised his full potential - as well as just how valuable his extreme appetite is.

'I play a lot of sport, so I’m always hungry and try to eat healthy,' he told the Central Coast Express Advocate.

'I always knew I was a big eater but I didn’t realise I had a talent until I entered a competition to eat a two-foot long hot dog at Lone Star restaurant in Tuggerah just over a year ago.'

During that competition, he broke the restaurant’s record and has completed the challenge 10 times since.

After his hot dog success, he then beat hundreds to make the top ten of a Monster Burger challenge on the Gold Coast.

'I was up against the world record holder. The record was 18 minutes and I did it in nine,” the teenager said.

As a result of that win he has amassed hundreds of dollars in prize-winnings from competitions all over the country.

But, just like his appetite, he isn't satisfied with that - and wants to conquer the world with his talent.

'They say in life you should always pursue something you love and are good at. And for me, that’s eating. I’ve never failed a challenge yet,' Isaac said.

Isaac works out between 10 and 15 hours and week and also plays basketball.

When training for an event, the high school senior said he can wolf down 50 Weet-Bix in one sitting.

The only things he won't put in his mouth are anchovies and olives - but he said taste rarely plays a part in his mind when he is competing.

His dream is to head to the US to enter more competitive eating challenges in order to claim the world number one title.
