A barbecue, a few shots of vodka and a friendly judo match are key elements of a plan by maverick senator Jacqui Lambie to mend relations between Russia and Australia.

It comes after Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier this month vowed to shirtfront the Russian president when he visits Australia for the upcoming G20 meeting, drawing derision and anger from the Russian media.

The Palmer United Party senator met with Russian ambassador Vladimir Morozov on Tuesday and handed him two bottles of Tasmanian vodka and a t-shirt from the state's Ulverstone Judo Club.

The club wants to hold a fundraising judo fight between the two leaders, and Senator Lambie believes this will do wonders for international relations with the nuclear superpower.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will question Russian leader Vladimir Putin face to face at the G20 summit

'They have put their money on President Putin,' the Tasmanian told the senate on Wednesday.

'A barbecue, beers and a couple of vodkas ... would also be on the agenda.'

Club members want the t-shirt to go to Mr Putin 'with their best wishes' in appreciation of his promotion of the sport.

They also want him to accept an honorary membership.

Ms Bishop says the investigations have been 'very frustrating... on the ground in eastern Ukraine the rebels from time to time have prevented access to the site'

Putin agreed to Bishops plea to help scientists return to the crash site, as well as assisting with the investigations into what was behind the crash

The relationship between Russia and Australia has been fragile since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky above eastern Ukraine.

Russian-backed rebels are assumed responsible for the crash, which killed 38 Australians.

Mr Putin angered many Australians with his handling of the incident and the delay in assisting international access to the crash site.

Two-thirds of Australians support Prime Minister Tony Abbott confronting Vladimir Putin over the shooting down of MH17, after he pledged to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the tragedy. 

A Newspoll earlier this month found 63 per cent backed Mr Abbott taking a tough stance against President Putin at a G20 meeting in Brisbane next month, while only 27 per cent opposed it.

The prime minister grabbed global headlines after pledging to shirtfront Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting, comments he later backed away from.

Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin.

But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart.

'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' the prime minister said on Monday.

'I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.'

Abbott clarified his comments, explaining that he would hold 'robust talks' with the Russian president over the 'murder' of 38 Australians who died when MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine. 

Mr Abbott also said he would demand that Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation into the MH17 disaster and if evidence is required from the nation, it should be provided. 

Bishop says the investigations must be executed before the heavy snow typical of Ukrainian winter bury the site and hamper investigations.
