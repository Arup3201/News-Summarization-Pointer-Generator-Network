Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a raid by Pakistani military this morning

An Al-Qaeda leader accused of planning to bomb the London Underground and New York Metro has been killed during a raid in Pakistan, the country's military said.

Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for the terrorist group, was killed along with two other suspected militants in Shinwarsak, South Waziristan, early this morning.

The 'most wanted' terrorist was found hiding in a compound after fleeing from a  North Waziristan tribal district where the army launched a major operation against militant bases in June.

'The al-Qaida leader, who was killed by the Pakistan army in a successful operation, is the same person who had been indicted in the United Stated,' said a senior Pakistani army officer.

Shukrijumah, who lived in the US for 15 years, was accused of playing a role in plots against the London Underground and trains in Norway that never came to fruition.

He took over a position once held by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, who was captured in 2003. 

Federal prosecutors in the U.S. allege Shukrijumah recruited three men in 2008 to receive training in the lawless tribal region of Pakistan for carrying out attacks.

The New York indictment links him to the Manhattan plot and a similar never-executed scheme to attack British subways.

There had been a £3.2million reward available for information leading to his arrest. 

Pakistan military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a tweet that five 'terrorists' were also arrested during the raid.

After the September 11 terror attacks, Shukrijumah was seen as one of al-Qaida's best chances to attack inside the U.S. or Europe, captured terrorist Abu Zubaydah told U.S. authorities. 

He lived in the US for 15 years but rose to a prominent position in Al-Qaeda and took over a position once held by the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks

He studied at a community college in Florida but when the FBI showed up to arrest him as a material witness to a terrorism case in 2003, he already had left the country.

The US authorities believe he visited Trinidad and London on his way to al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he started with lowly camp duties.

The FBI has been searching for Shukrijumah since 2003 but moved him up their wanted list when three men accused of plotting suicide bomb attacks on New York's subway system last year named him as their key liaison in Pakistan.
