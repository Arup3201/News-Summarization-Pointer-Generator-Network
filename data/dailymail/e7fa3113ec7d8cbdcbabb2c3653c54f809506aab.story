Neighbors of Erika Murray, the Massachusetts mother accused of hiding the death of three of her children, said they would see poorly dressed infants playing outside her home which they described as 'squalid'.

They described the smell at 23 St. Paul Street in Blackstone as atrocious and said that the home, which was discovered by police to be infested with vermin and soiled diapers, was a mess for years.

'I don't know how many times I've seen those children outside no shoes, no clothes on, eating out of a cracker box and drinking soda. This was 6:30, 7 o'clock in the morning,' said Marie White to NECN in an exclusive interview.

Murray was arrested on Thursday after detectives already investigating reckless endangerment discovered the bodies of three children inside her home.

Four other children aged 13, 10, six and three months were taken into protective custody afterwards.

Murray has been charged with fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child.

She is being held without bail.

Meanwhile, the search continued for more possible bodies at the filty, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, Massachusetts where four other children previously were removed into state custody.

The two youngest children have been also receiving medical treatment after showing signs of long-term neglect.

Neither child has birth records. The three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds, the Boston Globe reported. A six-month-old baby is extremely sensitive to sunlight. 

The father of the children apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators.  

Ms Murray appeared disheveled as she was arraigned in Uxbridge District Court on Friday morning.

Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arraigned on Friday for charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths of the three babies found at the Massachusetts home

Murray's attorney said that her client is mentally ill. A not guilty plea was entered on her behalf today during her arraignment at Uxbridge District Court

The judge agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance on reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month.

Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, pointing to the conditions in the home, suggested that his client was mentally ill. 

She was held without bail, NECN reported and is due back in court on October 14.  

Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies on Thursday at the house in Blackstone, about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. 

Four other children had been removed from the home two weeks earlier. 

Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arrested on charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths.  

Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in 'deplorable condition.' He said authorities don't know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. 

The body of one infant was found inside a closet, police said. The two other babies were found on Thursday.  

Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment on Friday. She is being held without bail and is due back in court on October 14

The infants were found dead inside the home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Thursday where four children were removed by authorities last month

Prosecutors said Murray, 31, would be arraigned on Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney.

A spokesman for the Blackstone Police Chief  told the Boston Globe today that Murray is believed to be the mother of all seven children.

The search of the home, which is just a couple hundred feet away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days.

The four other children, ages 13, ten, three and six months old, were removed from the house on August 28 after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions. 

The prosecutor said one of them approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn't stop crying. Early said the six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed.

Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits.

'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.'

Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years.

'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.'

She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. 

She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch.

Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad.

Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts

The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in.

'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said.

Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children.

The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect.

Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. 

Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'.

Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police.

He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed.

The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody. 

On Thursday, 31-year-old Erika Murray was arrested in connection with the appalling living condition but not over the children's deaths.

Murray is facing several charges, including witness intimidation. She will be arraigned on Friday.
