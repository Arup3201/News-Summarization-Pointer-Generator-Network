A speedboat driver drowned in the River Thames last night after the vessel capsized when three men took it for a high-speed test run.

Police divers were tonight trawling the murky water for the man's body after the tragedy which happened near the spot where two men drowned last year.

The man's father told bystanders that his son, who was apparently not wearing a lifejacket, could not swim.

High-speed horror: The driver of this sunken speedboat drowned in the River Thames at Shepperton, Surrey, after it flipped over when he and two other men took it out for a test run following repairs

'Thrown out': The 12ft fibreglass boat is believed to have capsized when the driver accelerated on a bend

His friend, who had been tipped into the river with another man, managed to keep his head above water but had to let go as the strong currents threatened to drag them both under.

Rescuers pulled the sunken speedboat to the river bank so police could examine it.

The drama happened as the three men revved up the 12ft fibreglass speedboat during a test-run on the Thames at Shepperton, Surrey last night, following repairs.

Witnesses on the idyllic stretch of the river spoke of the small craft passing their moored boats at speed, before they asked the driver to slow down.

As he reached a bend further on, the man was believed to have opened the throttle on the powerboat.

Pleasure boater Jim McCutcheon said: 'The current was very, very strong indeed when I saw a speedboat came up here with three men in it.

'They were going at speed. I told them to ease off because they were coming through a mooring and the skipper said "just testing" because they had done some repairs to the engine and were giving it a trial run.

'He did slow down and went through nice and slow and I remember saying: "You wait until he gets to the bend. He’ll open her up - and he did.

'Unfortunately, I think they were to one side and they were thrown out.'

He said throttling up while turning into a strong current would have been like turning into a brick wall.

'That’s the mistake,' he said. 'The biggest mistake of the day was nobody was wearing lifejackets.'

He added that he and other boaters had learned the man’s father had arrived at the scene from his home in the New Forest, Hampshire, at around 10pm last night.

'He had a word with a woman,' said Mr McCutcheon. 'He was in a terrible state. He told her his son couldn’t swim.'

David Green, a local boat builder, was carrying out repairs to his vessel near the scene and had also been passed by the boat.

He said: 'It was just a little speedboat, about 12ft. I think if went over because they were all sitting on one edge and the river’s been running really strongly lately.

'I didn’t take much notice when they went past because so many people go above the speed limit because it’s just four knots here.

'It happens because people get big engines and they want to see how fast the boat can go.'

He said the first he knew something was wrong was when he heard shouting and looked over to see an upturned hull.

'I just thought it was a sailing dinghy,' he said.

'The (missing) guy’s mate had him in the water. He was holding him up but he had to let go because he couldn’t hold him any longer.'

He added: 'The other one had swum to the other bank. He started shouting and freaking out and saying he was in shock but what can you do? The river’s so strong.'

He said that man was rescued by the fire service, who deployed their boat and used specialist underwater equipment to search for the missing man.

The other survivor was helped by a group of youths, who took a lifebelt from its stand and threw it to him, before pulling him from the water.

Mr Green was one of several people to comment on the fact that the trio were not properly kitted out.

'If they had been wearing life jackets the guy would still be alive. I think it should be mandatory.'

Dog walker Duncan Macduff, 38, from Shepperton, was at the scene minutes after the accident.

He said it was common for speedboats to throttle up as they rounded the corner. I’ve seen it happen a few times here, he said.

'When they get to the corner they open up round the bend.'

Police divers were sent into the water and also used a camera on a pole to search the upturned boat and the banks and river bed.

Meanwhile, a police helicopter with a thermal imaging camera hunted for any signs of body heat along the stretch of river.

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'Surrey Police was called to Russell Road in Shepperton at just before 6pm yesterday to reports that a boat had capsized and three people had fallen into the River Thames.

'Officers attended the scene where a teenage boy and a man in his 40s had managed to get to safety, however a third person, a man believed to be in his 40s is still missing.'

The trio were believed to have taken to the water in their boat in nearby Walton-on-Thames.

Music executive Keith Lowde and Dr Rex Walford drowned in the River Thames at Shepperton in January last year as Mr Lowde was ferrying himself and five friends from a river island dinner party at his home to the shore in pitch darkness.
