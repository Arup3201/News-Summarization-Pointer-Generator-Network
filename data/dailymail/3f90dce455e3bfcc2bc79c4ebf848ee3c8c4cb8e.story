These pictures show the terrifying moment an unconscious skydiver hurtled towards the ground after he was knocked out seconds after jumping from a plane at 12,500ft.

Experienced skydiver James Lee, 25, was hit from behind by another skydiver and knocked out, just after he made jumped at the Skydive ground in Netheravon, Wiltshire.

He was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who, having seen what had happened, postponed pulling their own cords and instead dived towards Mr Lee, grabbing hold of him and deploying his parachute.

These pictures, taken on Mr Lee's head-camera, show the other divers making signs to check he is OK before realising he is not and taking the action that saved his life.

You OK? This picture, taken on Mr Lee's head-camera, shows another skydiver asking the unconscious man if he is alright.

Mr Lee only regained consciousness as he drifted safely down to the ground, where he landed safely and with no memory of what had happened.

He said: 'I've been skydiving for five years and this was my 1,050th jump.  There were 12 people in this skydive, with others leaving the plane just after we jump off.

'One of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin.

'They were falling faster than I was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force, knocking me out.'

He went on: 'I am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realised something was wrong.

'They chased after me and fortunately I roll into a more stable position - still quickly drifting in the sky.

Mr Lee regained consciousness as he floated down, with no memory of the accident

'At first the other skydivers give basic hand signals that we teach our students to correct their body position and find I am still not responding.

'They manage to get hold of me to try and stop my body tumbling again as we get closer to the altitude where, as a group we separate to deploy our parachutes.

'They signal to the other jumpers to get away as they were unaware of what was happening. They then deploy my main parachute. Once I was clear they deployed their own.'

It wasn’t until Mr Lee was under the canopy that he began to regain consciousness, and he landed safely on the ground with no memory of the drama that had unfolded seconds earlier.

He was taken to hospital where he was treated for an injury to his head, and then given the all-clear and discharged.

Now he says the accident, which happened last July, 'has not put me off at all.'

Mr Lee added: 'I am very glad that everything unfolded how it did.

'This is not something you are taught to do or practise for as it is very uncommon. I think my mum and girlfriend are more relieved than I am.' 

Help arrives: This head-cam shot shows one of Mr Lee's friends grab his arm to steady him before pulling the cord
