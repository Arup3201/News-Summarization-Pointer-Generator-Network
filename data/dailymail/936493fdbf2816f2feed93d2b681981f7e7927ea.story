Usain Bolt has taken on a two sessions a day training regime in a push to perform somewhere close to his peak for Jamaica at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The six-time Olympic gold medallist has undergone the intense preparation to speed up the recovery process having taken nine weeks off training after recent foot surgery.

'It’s been rough, but I’ve been through it a couple times so I know what it takes to get back so I’m just pushing on and working towards what’s necessary for this season,' Bolt said.

While Bolt won't be expected to run as fast as his own world record, he determined he can do a job for his country.

'I really wanted to run at the Commonwealths Games over the years,' he said. 'And although I got injured I see where I can run the 4x100. I see where I’m getting back into shape to actually compete in the 4x100.

'I’m going there for my fans and I’m going there to show that I’m getting back into shape and they can look for great things now and for the years to come,' he said.

Bolt could have pushed for a place in the individual 100m or 200m but said he didn't want to take the place of another athlete who had won their place at the Jamaica national trials.
