The selfie craze has even reached the animal kingdom, it appears.

Students at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey have revealed these amazing images captured life in the park from the animal's point of view.

Cameras were installed in animal proof boxes and put in enclosures as part of the project.

While a female played with the camera, a grumpy looking male silverback called Bodongo sat grumpily in the background.

The pair came up with a tossed a camera into the gorilla enclosure after encasing it in a reinforced box.

The box contained raisins, so the gorillas lifted the box over their heads to shake out the food and in the process recorded themselves and their family members. 

They even managed to sum of life in the gorilla enclosure perfectly - while a female played with a camera, a grumpy looking male silverback called Bodongo sat grumpily in the background.

Created by American students Eloise Sherrid and Zoe Lohmann, they are part of an art project the pair developed.

'They are from an ongoing video project Zoe and I are working on to promote the Trust's conservation methods and education programs,' Sherrid told Dailymail.com.

'We're both very passionate environmentalists, so as artists we decided to put our skills to use helping Durrell get recognition for the extraordinary work they do around the globe.'

Sherris admitted that the gorilla picture was a particularly tough one to capture, and at one point the she was shouted at by Bodongo, the silverback, for getting too close to his son.

'I was too aggressive with my attempts to film the baby, Indigo, so his father shouted at me a few times to back off.'  

Jon Stark, a Senior Ape Keeper at Durrell, did an experiment a few years ago where he tossed a camera into the gorilla enclosure after encasing it in a reinforced Pelican box, so the pair used this approach. 

'Together we recreated the scenario with HD video, and were able to record the silverback, Badongo, his mate Kahili, and their son Indigo. 

'The box contained raisins, so the gorillas lifted the box over their heads to shake out the food and in the process recorded themselves and their family members.'

Female orangutans Annette and  her offspring Jantho seemed keep to try and eat the raising hidden in the camera box.

Kea, the parks 'miracle' orangutan, born to a mother who had been declared 'infertile' was also part of the experiment.

'Some of the animals, like the Livingstone fruitbats, were very comfortable being filmed up close with keeper supervision,' the pair said.

'To get to the hard to reach places, we mounted a GoPro camera to a broom handle and raised it up to the ceiling to capture them hanging from an angle not usually accessible by humans. 

'The bats actually reached out a few times and tried to climb onto the stick.'

The pair also went to Sorel Point, where the photographed sheep.

The team created a range of cameras for the project, ranging from a protected camera for orangutans and gorillas to a pole camera for sheep.

'On this occasion we also got to meet the local flock of sheep, who were decidedly more interested in finding out if our camera equipment was edible than they were impressed by our repeated arm brandishing and attempts at scaring them off.'

They are now working on editing the video footage from the experiment, which is set to be released later this year. 

'We've found that documenting animals and humans really isn't that different,' they said.

'We have collected many great and memorable moments. 

'However, we have also collected about 30 hours of footage along the way and are facing the daunting task of sifting through it all and finding just the right pieces to create our final collection of videos. '
