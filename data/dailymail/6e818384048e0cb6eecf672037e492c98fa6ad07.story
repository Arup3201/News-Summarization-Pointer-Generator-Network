Samantha Cameron opted for subdued but smart High Street style for her husband’s keynote speech today.

The Prime Minister’s wife likes to keep her look simple when it comes to supporting David at key events, and often chooses affordable off-the-peg pieces to show supporters that she isn't immune to the national tightening of the purse strings.

But while her ASOS.com dress said 'I'm one of you', the designer belt that she chose to wear it with shouted 'not really, only pretending!' thanks to the price tag being almost five times that of the polyester dress.

At least Samantha, 42, was recycling: she cinched the waist of her £42 stretch teal dress with one of her favourite Emilia Wickstead belts.

The £196 croc-effect belt has been worn to several high profile events, including a trip to see the Obamas in 2012.

Prime Minster David Cameron (R) arrives with his wife Samantha Cameron before delivering his keynote speech on the last day of the annual Conservative Party Conference at Manchester Central.

Samantha is a firm fan of Emilia 
Wickstead and is often seen donning her designs, which are also favoured
 by the Duchess of Cambridge.

The fashion fan seems to have packed away her summer wardrobe as she 
teamed the knee-length shift with a coat from Cos that she has 
been spotted in throughout the conference.

On
 Wednesday she wore the same coat with tones of grey and nodded to her
 fashion know-how by finishing off the look with stylish touches such as
 a Peter Pan collared shirt, a dove grey travel wallet and chunky patent
 heels.

Today’s look is 
simple but effective and while it isn’t the first lady’s finest fashion 
moment it will be a hit with working women everywhere, and the wool 
Crombie-effect coat is a sure-fire sell out.

David Cameron told wife Samantha he was 'incredibly proud' of her as she watched him make his keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.

The Prime Minister singled her out near the front of the audience as he hailed the 'national heroes' who drive the economy by setting up their own businesses.

'To all those people who strike out on their own, who sit there night after night, checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up, I say I have so much respect for you.

'You are national heroes,' he said.

'I'll never forget watching Samantha do just that - winning her first customer, sorting out the cash flow, that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed,' he said.

'I was incredibly proud of her then - and I am incredibly proud of you now.'

Mrs Cameron's first business designed shop window displays, interiors and packaging and one of her clients was luxury stationers Smythson. She later joined and became creative director.

She stepped down from that position into a part-time role shortly after Mr Cameron entered Downing Street as premier in May 2010.

As he received an ovation from activists at the end of his speech, he brought Mrs Cameron onto the stage to share the plaudits.

Being the former creative director 
for a luxury leather goods brand Smythson and ambassador to the British 
Fashion Council, it's no surprise Samantha Cameron takes her role as 
first lady of fashion extremely seriously.

She may have been wearing a high-street dress but David Cameron's wife added a designer touch to her outfit today with an Emilia Wickstead belt.

Belted up: Samantha opted for an Emilia Wickstead belt with her ASOS dress

The £196 Black Crocodile Embossed Leather Waist Belt (down to £98 in a recent sale) comes complete with an adjustable double gold-tone stud fastening.

It's not the first time that Samantha has donned the design.

She was spotted wearing it on two occasions in March last year during her trip to the States - and she clearly likes it so much, she even snapped one up in navy as well as black.
