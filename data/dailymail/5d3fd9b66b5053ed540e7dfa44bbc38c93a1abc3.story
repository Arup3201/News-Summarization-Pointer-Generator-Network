She's been pictured out and about all over the place during fashion week so it's a good job supermodel Irina Shayk is well connected in the designer shoe world.

The 28-year-old Russian beauty's latest advertising campaign sees her appearing in a brand new spring/summer photo shoot for Spanish shoe brand XTI.

The pictures show her draped around the shoulders of heavily tattooed British model Stephen James, casually holding onto her pretty summer sandals of course.

We're sure her boyfriend, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who Irina has been dating since May 2010 isn't the jealous type - just as well as the two half naked models look very close in these campaign shots.

And in the pictures she's not sharing with Stephen - the campaign shows exactly why Irina has rocketed to supermodel stardom, showcasing her stunning figure in revealing outfits.
