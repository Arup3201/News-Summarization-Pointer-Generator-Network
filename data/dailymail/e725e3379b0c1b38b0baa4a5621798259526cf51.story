Share prices have hit levels not seen since before the start of the financial crisis, offering some respite to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of the Budget on March 20

Share prices last night hit levels not seen since before the start of the financial crisis.

The FTSE 100 index closed in London at its highest point since January 2008. It was up 86 points to 6,432 – taking its gains this year to £135billion.

In New York, the Dow Jones hit the highest point in its 117-year history.

The rally is a boost to pension pots and savings and suggests investors are regaining confidence in the world economy following years of crisis and recession.

It will also offer some respite to George Osborne ahead of the Chancellor’s Budget on March 20 – and could foster confidence among businesses and households.

But experts remained cautious about the prospects of a recovery in the wider economy. Paul Atkinson, an analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ‘With luck, we will see a recovery take hold in the second half of the year.

‘The question now is whether we are seeing a stealth rally in danger of running its course or whether we have the conditions for further market gains.’ A report by financial research group Markit suggested the economy would grow by 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2013.

This would be enough to prevent a third recession in quick succession but it would still not be enough to reverse the 0.3 per cent slump in the final quarter of last year.

‘While the UK may have avoided a triple-dip recession, the underlying picture is one of a modest and hesitant upturn,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

The stock market rally was hailed as a milestone for investors who saw swathes of their wealth wiped out when the near collapse of the global banking system sent shares into freefall in the Great Panic of 2008 and 2009.

‘It has been a long time coming,’ said Richard Hunter, head of equities at UK stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. ‘It has been a very strong start to the year and is improving pension pots so it really does matter.’

Chris Low, chief economist at FTN 
Financial in New York, said the Dow’s record was ‘particularly 
significant because this economic cycle has been so challenging’.

Recession beaters: Stock markets around the world have steadily risen since the start of the year

The rally has been fuelled by the hundreds of billions of pounds of emergency cash pumped into the financial system and economy by central banks such as the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve.

Investors fed up with miserable returns elsewhere, due to record low interest rates, have been encouraged to plough money into shares amid hopes the powerhouse economies of the US and China will lead a recovery in the global economy.

The FTSE 100 index has broken through a peak of three weeks ago to take it to five-year highs.

Fears of an imminent collapse of the eurozone have also eased – despite the political unrest in Italy – while the UK economy looks set to avoid a triple-dip recession by the skin of its teeth.

The FTSE crashed from a pre-crisis peak of 6,732 in mid-2007 to a low of 3,512 in March 2009 – a fall of nearly 50 per cent. The collapse of US investment banking giant  Lehman Brothers in the autumn of 2008 sent the financial markets into meltdown.

The crisis also forced British taxpayers to rescue banks including Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS owner Lloyds.

The surge in share prices on both sides of the Atlantic suggests that after more than five miserable and turbulent years, when global capitalism looked to be teetering on the edge, business confidence is finally returning.

Almost unnoticed, the Dow Jones Industrial Index has reached the highest level in its history – dragging Britain’s FTSE 100 index and other global markets ever higher.

The surge in shares, after a long drought for investors, provides a glimmer of hope to savers with pensions, investment and unit trusts and individual savings accounts with large equity holdings.

The timing of the rally, which has carried shares indexes some 10 per cent higher since the start of the year, is remarkable given recent economic and political news.

There was despair only last week when Congress and the White House failed to agree on a US budget and ushered in automatic cuts and tax rises – in the shape of the ‘sequester’.

In Europe, the stalemate in the Italian elections looked to signal another period of crisis for the euro.

Remarkably, however, international investors fed up with the very low interest rate returns on cash accounts and government bonds have decided that putting money back into business, through the stock market, is a better option.

Investors have also been encouraged by better economic developments.

In Britain a recovery in the services sector, which accounts for 70 per cent of total output, has raised hopes that a ‘triple dip’ recession can be avoided.

Indeed, with revised numbers showing the economy having expanded by 0.3 per cent last year there are serious questions as to whether there was really a ‘double dip’ at all.

The improving growth outlook is reinforced by the latest information from China, that has promised to maintain an ambitious growth target for 2013, and signs that America is showing great resilience with industry recovering and employment prospects the best for nearly seven years.

Stock markets are generally regarded as a significant indicator of the economic future, often rising six months to 18 months ahead of a full recovery.

But they are not infallible. The Nobel-prize winning American economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped that the ‘stock market has forecast nine out of the last five recessions’ – a testimony to its historic unreliability. Nevertheless, the move of smart money out of cash and bonds into shares ought to boost the investment returns of all of our long suffering pension funds that have been badly holed by a long period of low interest rates.

It should also underpin the confidence of business. The higher the share price the more freedom directors have to plan investment and recruit staff.

For the moment the recovery is being stimulated by the financial ‘cocaine’ of low interest rates and printing of money.

The test will come when central banks decide this help is no longer needed.
