Manchester City playmaker David Silva believes the Barclays Premier League champions have got to stop Barcelona scoring if they are to have any chance of pulling off a miracle at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night.

Silva and his team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and head into the game having been written off by just about everybody.

However, the Spanish international believes Manuel Pellegrini's team can progress if they manage to become only the fifth team — and the first in the competition — to stop Luis Enrique's team scoring.

It is a task easier said than done to stop Barcelona, led by Lionel Messi, from scoring at home

'We need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against Roma and Bayern Munich in the group stages,' Silva said.

'The most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult.

'Strange things can happen. Everybody wrote Schalke off before they played Real Madrid but they won 4-3 and could have scored again which would have put them through. Nobody predicted that.

'Not many thought PSG could beat Chelsea, especially with only 10 men for so long, so I know that everything can happen, not only in the Champions League but in every game.

'Everyone is expecting Barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we don't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away.'

City travelled to Spain at this stage last season, having lost the home leg 2-0. This time they are slightly better off following Joe Hart's last-minute penalty save from Lionel Messi at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago.

'We played well in the second leg against Barca last season and played with freedom so we will see,' added Silva.

Revered in Spain, where he played for first Celta Vigo and then Valencia, Silva has long been coveted by Barcelona and indeed Real Madrid.

The 29-year-old has insisted, however, that he isn't thinking about a move away from City and has enjoyed playing further up the field under Manuel Pellegrini this season.

'I have played closer to the box in a more advanced position this season and that's why I'm scoring goals,' he said.

'It's more about the team than individuals. If we are good as a group we can make the difference. I always have freedom in the pitch but now we need all the players at their best if we are to go through

'I have four more years on my contract and I'm very happy here — I have always said that. The way the supporters are with me is something I'm very proud of and it inspires me to play my best and I'm humbled to have that kind of appreciation every time I play.'

City will train at their own base in Manchester on Tuesday morning before flying to Barcelona early in the afternoon.
