The fate of Flight FU 9525 that was deliberately crashed into the Alps has chilling similarities to a number of other aircraft  believed to have been downed by flight crew.

Germanwings pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the Airbus A320 into the mountain at more than 400mph, killing all 150 on board.

The  final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'.

It echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight MH370 - which vanished last March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.

Recent analysis of satellite data taken from the lost Malaysian Airlines flight indicates the aircraft may have been deliberately flown off course - suggesting the pilot took actions similar to Lubitz's.

Other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, who was captain of Moza LAM flight 470 that crashed in Namibia in November 2013.

Air crash investigators think the Embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet, killing all 27 passengers and six crew.

Fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death. 

When his co-pilot went to the toilet, flight data information recovered from the scene found that Fernandes manually changed the aircraft's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level. 

He also pushed the aircraft's throttles back to idle and selected the jet's maximum operating speed.

Chillingly, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door, similar to Captain Patrick Sondenheimer's attempts to regain access to the flight deck.

It emerged today that co-pilot Lubitz made similar changes to his autopilot system - entering a new target altitude of just 96ft moments before the crash. 

The first relief officer of an EgyptAir flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic approximately 30 minutes after leaving John F Kennedy Airport in New York on October 31, 1999.

The Boeing 767-366 had 14 crew and 203 passengers on board.

The National Transport Safety Board who investigated the disaster blamed the crash on the flight's relief first officer.

Captain Gamil al-Batouti said he would relieve the current pilot - even though he wasn't due on the flight deck for a further three hours.

The co-pilot remained with al-Batouti, but when the co-pilot went for a toilet break, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea, killing everyone on board.

The cockpit flight recorder heard al-Batouti claim in Arabic 'I place my fate in the hands of God' before the aircraft hit the ocean.

El-Batouty even shut down the aircraft's engines, which prevented his co-pilot from saving the aircraft.  

According to the NTSB 'the probable cause of the crash of EgyptAir flight 990 was the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs. 

'The reason for the relief first officer's actions was not determined.' 

In December 1997, a Boeing 737 with 97 passengers and seven crew crashed into the Musi River in southern Sumatra, Indonesia.

The NTSB investigated this crash as it involved a US-built aircraft and determined that the jet crashed due the 'direct flight control inputs' of the pilot, probably the captain. 

However, in both cases, Egyptian and Indonesian authorities do not accept that either of their pilots would have deliberately crashed their own aircraft.
