The 24-year-old gained huge popularity during the 2014 World Cup as a video of her showcasing her skills went viral.

Castillo is pictured sitting on the floor doing numerous keepy-uppies, as well as showing off her shooting skills as she scores goals aplenty on the half-volley.

Castillo is more than confident in her own ability, in the past claiming she would beat Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi in a freestyling contest.

As well as this Castillo claims she beat 800 men at freestyling on Ipanema beach in Brazil - proving she is more than a match for her opposite sex.
