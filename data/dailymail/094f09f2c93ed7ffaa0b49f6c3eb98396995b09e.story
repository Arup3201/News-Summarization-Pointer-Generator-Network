In 1967, a 13-year-old Oklahoma boy sent his mother a postcard. This past Feb. 15, that postcard suddenly decided to arrive.

Forty-six years ago, Bert Jacobson went on a family trip to the east coast to buy trucks and equipment for the family’s concrete business.

Mailbox Mystery: 46 years after he sent it, Bert Jacobson's postcard to his mom mysteriously arrived

Along the way, it seems the family visited the Old Country Store Museum in Hereford, Pennsylvania.

‘It was an awesome trip,’ Jacobson recalled to Oklahoma’s KWTV.

Like any 13-year-old, Jacobson wanted to let his mother know what a great time he and his father and cousins were having.

‘Mom, Hi. We've been having a great time,’ Jacobson read aloud to a news crew while examining the perplexing postcard.

Unlikely story: 'This is one in a billion' says a now grown up Jacobson, who sent the card from Penn. in 1967

Tattered and yellowed, Jacobson’s curlicue cursive is still legible and a picture of a country store and a pot belly stove are clearly visible on the reverse.

A 1967 postmark and Abraham Lincoln stamp carrying the price of four cents are also perfectly preserved.

Wherever the postcard was all those years, it was protected from damaging elements.

Still legible: Jacobson's cursive can still be read and the Abe Lincoln four cent stamp and USPS postmark from 1967 are still quite clear

However, no one has a clue where the place was.

‘Under a piece of machinery? I don't know,’ Jacobson wondered.

But how the card suddenly went from lost to history to delivered like an everyday bill is a mystery.

Unsolved: No one in the family knows how or why the card finally showed up, delivered as if it was an everyday parcel

‘I have no idea,’ Jacobson mused, shaking his head.

All those years ago, Jacobson addressed his childhood shoutout mom to the family business post office box.

Miraculously, the family still uses that same PO box today and that, of course, is where the mystery card ended up.

Jacobson’s sister, Marilyn Hubbard, said it was a company employee who first picked up the parcel.

‘This can’t be,’ was the shocked secretary’s response, Hubbard said.

So what was Jacobson’s mom’s response to her son’s suddenly surfacing card?

‘She wasn’t really surprised that Burt had written her a card,’ Hubbard said, smiling, ‘but she was very surprised that it took years to get here.’

As for cool-headed Jacobson, he seemed to think such freak occurrences are bound to happen to someone.

‘Sure this is one in a billion,’ he said, ‘mine just happened to be one of them.’
