A tense diplomatic standoff between Kiev and the Kremlin over a convoy of 'humanitarian vehicles' attempting to travel from Russia into Ukraine has continued today.

Around 280 white trucks, which President Vladimir Putin says are carrying aid packages for the people of Luhansk, are still stationed at a military base near the Russian city of Voronezh today.

Officials from the two nations exchanged colourful insults late last night over the convoy, with Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov telling Putin where he could stick his aid.

The tense situation continued today amid reports that at least 12 Ukrainian activists have been shot dead after a bus was attacked in Dontesk.

Russia claims the trucks contain aid packages for the people of the Luhansk region but have refused to cooperate with the Red Cross in delivering the supplies, leading to suspicions from Ukraine

Attacked: 12 Ukraine Far Right militiamen were allegedly shot dead in an attack on this bus near Donetsk

 The shuttle, owned by the Ukrainian Right Sector, was allegedly ambushed by pro-Russian separatists this morning in what was billed as an anti-terror operation. 

Many others on board were wounded and taken hostage, the Kiev-based party claims.

It comes a day after Kiev reports claimed six military officers were killed and 31 left wounded after fighting broke out in the region.

The Far Right party's leader Dmytro Yarosh claims the bus held one of their combat groups travelling outside the rebel-held city of Dontesk, which is under siege by government troops.

A spokesman for the radical nationalist movement Artem Skoropadskyi told Ukrainian News Agency: 'While being seated here in Kiev we don't know a great deal. 

'I know that 12 our activists were killed, some more were wounded; I think details will appear throughout the day.

'There is a suspicion that the wounded will be treated very harshly and could be shot,' he said.

The Right Sector volunteer battalion does not formally operate within the government armed forces but coordinates its activities with the security services and the Defense Ministry.

It comes as government troops advance on the rebel-held city with the support of the Ukrainian Far Right

Right Sector played a marginal if highly visible role in the street uprising that culminated in the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych in February. 

Its far-right affiliations have made it a target of substantial lurid reporting in Russia state media, which has sought to cast the leadership that took over from Yanukovych as an extremist cabal.

Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said Wednesday that 11 servicemen were killed in the previous day's fighting, but he could not immediately specify whether that figure included the Right Sector militiamen.

Inside Donetsk, at least three people were killed overnight Tuesday as the government intensifies its shelling campaign.

Associated Press reporters saw two bodies lying in a street Wednesday morning in the city's southwestern Petrovsky district, 11 hours after the rocket fire ended. The city government reported three deaths.

Residents said the intermittent artillery barrage lasted around two hours. One high-rise building appeared to have been struck five times.

City authorities said 10 residential buildings and the wing of a hospital were struck.

Donetsk city council spokesman Maxim Rovinsky said the shelling Tuesday night was some of the heaviest the city has seen.

Government troops have laid siege to Donetsk and nearby rebel holdings in their push to quash the pro-Russian insurgency. They have largely refrained from street-to-street fighting, favoring often inaccurate rocket fire.

Damage to power generation plants and gas pipelines has left large parts of the city without electricity and gas.

Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has been meeting with government officials in the now Russia-held Crimea as

He has come under fire today as Russia's controversial 'humanitarian convoy' headed for the Ukrainian border today - and faced a barrage of social media attack suggesting its true purpose was sinister.

Moscow has insisted that the 280 trucks contain only aid for the war-ravaged residents of Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

But both Kiev - which said it would not be allowed in- and the West have expressed fears it contains military equipment, an accusation strongly denied as 'absurd' by Vladimir Putin's officials.

Russia says the convoy, which left a military base near Moscow on Tuesday, is carrying about 2,000 tonnes of water, baby foods and other goods.

But this afternoon it stopped in central Russia and is now at a standstill near Voronezh, 185 miles from the proposed crossing.
