Blackpool wants to use new anti-lout powers to ban 'inappropriate dress' on stag and hen weekends.

The seaside town – once famous for its 'kiss me quick hats' – says public nudity during the daytime sends out the wrong message.

But critics say the move would be the equivalent of criminalising women for showing too much cleavage or wearing a short skirt.

The Daily Mail reported last month how Town Halls were being given sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life.

Ministers insist the so-called public spaces protection orders (PSPO) are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging.

But the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of 'nuisance parking', children playing ball games and parents parking outside schools.

Council officers can put up signs banning an activity in a specified area, either round the clock or during specific hours.

Anybody flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally ranging from £70 to £100, issued by a police officer, PCSO, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall.

Refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person responsible in court.

Yesterday, Blackpool Council cabinet member Gillian Campbell said PSPOs could be used to target the dress of stag and hen parties.

Blackpool Councillor Gillian Campbell said PSPOs could be used to target the dress of stag and hen parties. This would involve a restriction on 'public nudity' or inappropriate dress in the daytime

This would involve a restriction on 'public nudity' or inappropriate dress in the daytime.

Josie Appleton, of the Manifesto Club, said: 'This move to regulate public dress - and to make it a criminal offence to dress inappropriately - represents a worrying move of the state into questions of fashion and mores.

'There are laws against public disorder - a measure such as this will make the mere showing of cleavage into a criminal offence.

'And who in the council will be appointed the judge of what is and is not inappropriate dress? Will there be official measures issued for the length of ladies' skirts?

Blackpool has been trying to change the town's image .

Earlier this year, tourism boss Graham Cain originally said 'kiss me quick, stag and hens' should 'go somewhere else' – suggesting Manchester or Liverpool as alternatives.

The way Blackpool would like to see itself portrayed - as a glamorous holiday destination

Amid an outcry from tourism firms, Mr Cain later clarified that he only wanted to deter the more unruly groups who behave in a lewd and drunken way, putting off other visitors.

The town also rebuffed a bid by TV reality show Geordie Shore to come to Blackpool and restrictions have been placed on its lap-dancing clubs, insisting dancers do not remove all their clothing.

In a statement, Mrs Campbell said yesterday: 'We have a strong record of tackling anti-social behaviour, however, we know that doing so is a never ending process and we cannot rest on our laurels.

'We won't hesitate to use and test these new powers to send a message loud and clear; anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in Blackpool.'

PSPOs replace three existing kinds of order: gating orders, which allow for the closure of alleys used for anti-social behaviour; Designated Public Place Orders (DPPOs), which allow for the confiscation of alcohol; and Dog Control Orders, which can prohibit dogs or require that they be on leads.
