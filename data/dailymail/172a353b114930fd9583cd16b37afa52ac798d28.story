Ed Davis never expected to see his dog alive again after she wandered off on February 6. 

When his pooch, a blind 11-year-old Labrador retriever named Madera, strayed from home in Ester, Alaska, a cold front had dropped the temperature to 40 degrees below zero.

Madera, who is completely blind because of an autoimmune disease, usually would come right back inside when it was that cold.

For some reason she stayed out and got lost, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported.

Davis' wife was home at the time.  

When Davis returned from his job at the trans-Alaska oil pipeline on February 19, he was not hopeful about finding Madena.

He said: 'My best hope was to walk those trails and look for a track that might be hers.

'My best hope was to find a frozen dog.'

He never did find Madena, but another man did - and she was alive.

Constantine Khrulev was on a trail about a half mile away from Davis' house with his own dog last week. 

Khrulev's dog was wearing a bell and when Madena heard it ring, she let out a loud whine. 

After venturing about 100 yards off the trail, Khrulev found Madera under a tree, a location where she 'was not going to be found accidentally', according to Davis.

Madera was healthy but she did lose about 14 pounds.

Davis was offering a $100 reward for Madena. 

Khrulev asked for the money to be given to the Fairbanks Animal Shelter Fund and Davis ended up donating $250 because he was impressed by the request.
