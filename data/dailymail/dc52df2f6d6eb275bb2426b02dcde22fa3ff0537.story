A Second World War air raid shelter buried for more than 70 years has been discovered at a primary school by a pupil - and it was so well preserved the light bulb was still working.

The iconic Anderson shelter was unearthed at Stoke Community Primary School, in Medway, Kent.

Youngster Harvey Cotton, ten, had been taking part in a school activity when he saw a block of concrete at the back of what used to be an orchard in the school grounds.

School caretaker Chris Poulter was sent to investigate and was amazed at what he found.

He said: 'We cleared away some of the vegetation and saw the steps down to the shelter.

'After more clearance work we were able to get to the entrance. It was bricked up most of the way and there was a wooden door behind it.

'We knocked through the bricks and it opened up into the shelter.'

Once inside Chris and parent helper Martin Blackwell discovered a crate of dusty old milk bottles and other items that had lain untouched for decades.

The pair were even more surprised when they ran an extension lead down to the shelter and switched on the light and the bulb still worked.

It's thought the shelter was used during the Blitz by pupils at the school and local villagers from nearby Lower Stoke.

The school now plans to restore the shelter so it can be used for hands-on lessons about the Second World War.

Volunteers from National Grid have agreed to connect a power supply and help with some of the clearance work to create better access to the shelter.

Head teacher Anita Meggs said: 'We feel very privileged to have such a wonderful resource in the school grounds.

'There is so much history in the school, which has been here since the 1800s. In September we plan on doing a project on the Second World War that will run all term.

'We hope to use the shelter for lessons and invite older villagers, who may have used the shelter, into the school to tell their stories about the war.'
