A lifelong San Francisco Giants fan is watching a series of games he might never remember after a brutal beating in 2011 left giant holes in his short-term memory.

Bryan Stow, 45, was the victim of a beating by two fans at Dodger Stadium parking lot in 2011 that pushed him into a coma and left him scarred for life.

'I know they won it,' the 45-year-old Stow told the paper of his favorite team's two championships in 2010 and ‘12.

Big win: Martin Rodgers of USA Today watched the Giants win over the Cardinals with Stow on Thursday night putting them one step closer to the World Series, one Stow may not remember 

'But I don’t really remember it. I want to see it happen again.'

Martin Rodgers of USA Today watched the Giants win over the Cardinals with Stow on Thursday night putting them one step closer to the World Series.

'The way they never give up,' Stow said.

'I love that. Loooove it. It is really real for them and for me. I love these guys. I feel connected. They make me feel like part of the team.'

The New York Post reports that Stow's attackers Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood were both sentenced to eight years in prison.

Unfortunately, Stow will have to spend more than eight years of his life experiencing just a portion of what he once did.

Stow is a divorced father of two who can barely take care of himself let alone his children.

Stow lives with his parents Dave and Ann who look after him.

He is also looked after by his sisters Erin and Bonnie and by professional caregivers.

'There are holes in his memory,' his mother told USA TODAY.

'Some things he remembers, some things he needs reminding of, some things he knows happened because he has been told about them.'

Even though he won an $18 million settlement from Dodgers stadium because they didn't provide enough parking lot security, he may not see most of that money for a very long time.

Stow requires extremely expensive 24-hour care.

'Bryan has made progress to a certain point because he is a fighter,' one of his attorneys, Tom Girardi said.

'But his mind and body are never going to be the same again. That is what was taken away from him,' he added.
