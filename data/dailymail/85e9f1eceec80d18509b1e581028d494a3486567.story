Jailed: Youth offending team boss Peter Nicholson, pictured, led a gang of fraudsters who claimed wages for bogus employees at Newham Borough Council in east London

A youth offending team boss honoured by the Queen with an OBE has been jailed for five and a half years after stealing almost £300,000 from one of Britain’s poorest councils to fund his lavish family holidays.

Peter Nicholson OBE, 58, fronted a gang of fraudsters who created ‘ghost’ employees at Newham Borough Council in east London and pocketed the wages.

Nicholson had arranged trips to Canada for himself and relatives, all at the expense of the taxpayer, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

On one occasion he and 10 others enjoyed a 10-day break to Canada worth £4,000 in February 2005.

Nicholson claimed the council ‘rewarded’ him with the holiday after he was made an OBE, a title he is now likely to lose.

But investigators rejected his claims as the trip was booked before the New Year’s Honours List was announced. 

Nicholson previously booked a nine-day break to Canada for himself and his daughter using council funds in 2002.

The con took place while he was head of the Youth Offending Team at Newham Council between May 20, 2000 and August 31, 2007. 

Nicholson's job there was to turn around children with criminal records.

On Friday he was found guilty of five counts of conspiracy to defraud after an eight-week trial.

The court heard Nicholson authorised three ‘ghost’ employees to be paid by the local authority when they did not exist, in order to syphon off the cash.

The payments were arranged by his finance officer, Shirin Bazrcar, 51, the manager of staffing agency Excel Employment, which received payments worth more than £65,000.

Bazrcar’s firm hired David Tuck, 52, who ran Lads Construction Ltd and was paid thousands of pounds by the council for fronting bogus building projects.

Nicholson was jailed for five and half years and Bazrcar was jailed for four years after being found guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud and two counts of money laundering.

Victims: Newham is one of the poorest boroughs in Britain and the gang siphoned away crucial taxpayers' money

Tuck, said to have been ‘brought into’ the scam by Nicholson and to have played a lesser role, received an 18-month prison sentence after being convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and a single count of money laundering.

Passing sentence, Judge Neil Sanders said Nicholson abused the ‘very 
high degree of trust’ placed in him by the council by setting up the 
‘sophisticated’ scam.

‘For all of you, this was the result of greed.

‘It’s clear the effect of these convictions will go beyond each of you as individuals and impacts greatly on your families.

Aide: David Tuck was part of the gang and he was also jailed on Friday for his part in the fraud

‘But I consider that given the seriousness of the offences, an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate.’

Prosecutor Alexander Goudie said the total amount stolen from the taxpayer was £281,771.90.

He added that payments for bogus employees were put into accounts held by Bazrcar’s 16-year-old son, Ali.

The address given for one ‘ghost’ was registered in the name of Nushan Mostani, Bazrcar’s sister.

Scott Wainwright, defending Nicholson, said he was now a ‘broken man’ and had lost everything as a result of the scam.

‘During
his tenure at the council he did some very positive work, with the 
Youth Offending Team being taken from the bottom to the top of the 
league.

‘The OBE will doubtlessly be removed and he will be stripped of the pension he has contributed to.

‘He acknowledges that if it were not for his actions, David Tuck would not be sitting where he is now.

‘He is aware of the effect his greed has had.’

Martin
McCarthy, for Bazrcar, told how she suffered from a ‘troubled’ mental 
state after the trial, requiring her to undergo treatment.

Nicholson’s
sister-in-law, Kerry Butler, 46, was found not guilty of a single count
of money laundering but will face a retrial in November in respect of a
charge of conspiracy to defraud, after the jury failed to reach a 
verdict.

His ex-wife, Sheila Butler, was cleared of involvement in the scheme on Judge Sanders’ direction.

Nicholson, of Bexleyheath, Kent, denied misconduct in a public office and five counts of conspiracy to defraud.

Judge Neil Sanders directed a not guilty verdict against Nicholson on the misconduct offence.

Bazrcar, of Hook, Hampshire, was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of money laundering.

David Tuck, of Bexley, Kent, was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of money laundering.

His wife Lorna Tuck, 45, of the same address, was cleared of two counts of conspiracy to defraud.

Christopher Smith, 48, Erith, Kent, was cleared of a single count of conspiracy to defraud.
