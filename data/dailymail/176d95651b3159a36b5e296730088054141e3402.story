At one point they were so close they slept side by side, but Mokwena the black rhino has gone walkabout and his human pal is desperate to track down his two-tonne chum.

Lyndsay Hunt has put out an appeal for the missing rhinoceros who has known for more than a decade.

The South African says he developed a bond with the animal when he first stomped into his life at the age of two after being mauled by a rival rhino in Solole Game Reserve on South Africa’s western cape.

Just the two of us: Lyndsay Hunt aboard black rhino Mokwena who he developed a bond with after he helped to nurse him back to health

The buffalo breeder then developed a bond with the leathery-skinned mammal during the years he spent nursing it back to health.

The animal grew to trust Mr Hunt so much that he let him feed, ride and play with him.

According to the rhino adopter Mokwena became so tame he would come like a puppy-dog when he was called by name and nuzzle him at the farm where he recovered.

Mr Hunt said: ‘When I went to visit him he immediately accepted me and I fell asleep outside his holding pen and woke up with him licking my hand.

‘He would come up and lie down next to me he knew me and was very affectionate.’

Eventually returning to health, Mokwena was released into the wilds of the Solole Game Reserve in 2006.

Each year Mr Hunt would return to the reserve to track down and play with his friend as these images show.

But it has now been nearly a year since he has been able to track Mokwena.

Mr Hunt added: ‘He's a wild rhino running around 4,000 hectares of bush.’

‘He was very curious last time I saw him - he recognised me and reacted to my presence

‘I came up to him and scratched him and he scratched me back

‘I saw his tracks a week ago but I didn't see him and he is hard to find now.’

Bath time: Rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and Mr Hunt said Mokwena interacted with him on his own level

Rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and Mr Hunt said Mokwena interacted with him on his own level by bumping against him so he could climb on the rhino’s back.

He added: ‘He would sometimes get excited and run towards me at full gallop in open savannah with something for me to climb up to get safely out the way.

‘So instead of worrying about dodging out the way I would swing onto his back.

‘He was only being playful and there was no aggression.’

Mr Hunt is eager to find his friend, who is now 12, so he can finally mate. He believes the animal is timid around females after the traumatic injury he received from another bull when he was very young.

But Mr Hunt said he is still determined to find a suitable mate for Mokwena before he is too old.

‘Rhinos are very intolerant of one another and will fight and even kill their own young. There are a lot of aggression issues but you need to find the right temperament,’ he added.

However the mission to mate Mokwena is a difficult one - the few black rhinos there are for sale can cost up to £150,000 and many are aggressive towards both males and females of the same species.

‘I'm looking for the right personality in a female, between six and eight years old,’ he said. ‘If she hates humans or rhinos we've got a problem, you can't just nip off to Tescos and grab one.’
