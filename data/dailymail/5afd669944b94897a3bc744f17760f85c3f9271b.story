It was one of the biggest spectacles of its day attracting hundreds of society's best dressed men and women.

As enormous gas-filled balloons floated across the sky, onlookers at the exclusive Hurlingham
Private Members Club would have been astonished at the cutting edge technology. 

Now more than a century later pictures of the event showing hundreds of immaculately turned out gentlemen preparing their balloons are to go on sale.

They show the deflated balloons being filled with gas and taking off in front of hundreds of spectators.

Here you can see immaculately turned out gentlemen preparing the balloons for a race that would have been a spectacular event at the time

Women can be seen watching the event dressed in
Victorian-style floor-length gowns and shading themselves from the May sunshine
under parasols.

The point-to-point competition, held at the Hurlingham
Private Members Club in Fulham, south west London, was staged by the Aero Club
of the United Kingdom.

Ten British flyers took part in the race as well as three
balloonists from Germany and a Belgian.

The 14 pilots took off at 3.30pm on May 22 and the winner
was the person who could land nearest to a designated site that was to be determined
on the day.

The winner was awarded an ‘objet d’art’ or £80 prize money
while the runner up won a lesser antique or £20.

Spectators who were non-members of the Aero Club could
purchase tickets for 10 shillings each.

Some 175 Verascope glass slides showing the event are being sold by Dominic Winter Auctioneers for an estimated £1,000

The ballooning craze was a gentleman's pass time but was watched by hundreds

The balloons were filled with gas rather than powered by a propane burner

Although the pastime became hugely popular in Victorian
England, the craze was born across the Channel.

But it wasn’t man who first took to the skies in a balloon – fittingly for the French, it was a cockerel.

The Montgolfier brothers experimented by sending up the
bird and it is also understood he had company in the form of a sheep and duck.

The passion for flight soon exploded across France and even the
visiting American president Benjamin Franklin was present at one flight. Asked what
use the contraptions could be, he famously replied: ‘Of what use is a new-born
baby?’

The early balloons used gas to float but it was not until
the 1960s that the US Office of Naval Research paid for research into a hot-air
balloon system that experts came up with the propane-burning system we see today.

It was the French who invented hot air ballooning as we know it, but as these pictures show it soon spread across the world

Hot air balloon races were a huge society event attracting hundreds of spectators

The glass plates are are expected to fetch up to £1,000 at auction

The event is a world away from the famous Bristol
International Balloon Fiesta, which is Europe’s largest ballooning event and
attracts over 150 hot air balloons.

It was launched in 1979 and regularly attracts 100,000
visitors with teams from around the world taking part in mass ascents where up to
100 balloons can set off simultaneously.

Modern hot air balloons are also capable of covering
extraordinary distances, as Richard Branson showed with his Virgin Atlantic
Flyer when he crossed the Atlantic.

Some 175 Verascope glass slides showing the race at Hurlingham
are being sold by Auctioneers in Cirencester for an estimated £1,000.
