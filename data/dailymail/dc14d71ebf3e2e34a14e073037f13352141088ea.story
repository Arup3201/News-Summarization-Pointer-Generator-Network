Monica Lewinsky's claims that she was mistreated by FBI agents and lawyers as they tried to make her testify against then-President Bill Clinton have been backed by a never-before-seen government report.

Lewinsky, who attained global notoriety for her affair with Clinton while working as a White House intern in 1998, had long claimed  agents tried to bully her into wearing a wire against Clinton after news of her romance with the world's most powerful man blew up.

Her voice cracked as she relived the encounter before a large crowd of millennials at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia on Monday morning during her first public speaking engagement in more than 12 years.

In her own words: Monica Lewinsky, 41, delivered a speech about bullying in the digital age at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in which she also relived the interrogation

She told how the 12-hour interrogation began in the food court of Pentagon City shopping mall, in Washington DC, before moving on to the adjoining Ritz-Carlton Hotel after she was tricked into going there by Linda Tripp - the colleague who had been secretly recording conversations with the young intern. 

Lewinsky, now 41, maintained that the agents and lawyers, working for Kenneth W. Starr's Office of Independent Counsel, mistreated her, even threatening her and her mother with criminal prosecution if she did not bend to their will.

'It was just like you see in the movies,' she said. 'Imagine, one minute I was waiting to meet a friend in the food court and the next I realized she had set me up, as two FBI agents flashed their badges at me.'

'Immediately following, in a nearby hotel room, I was threatened with up to 27 years in jail for denying the affair in an affidavit and other alleged crimes. Twenty-seven years. When you're only 24 yourself, that's a long time. Chillingly, told that my mother, too, might face prosecution if I didn't cooperate and wear a wire. And, in case you didn't know, I did not wear the wire.' 

Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998

Rare appearance: This is one of Monica Lewinsky's few public speeches, she last  spoke publicly 13 years ago

Not ashamed: Lewinsky told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with President Clinton as a 24-year-old woman straight out of college 

Now, the hitherto classified 100-page 'Report of the Special Counsel Concerning Allegations of Professional Misconduct By the Office of Independent Counsel in Connection with the Encounter With Monica Lewinsky' provides a highly detailed account of Lewinsky's first encounter with Starr's lawyers, based on documents and interviews with those involved.

According to the report, written in 2000 but unveiled by The Washington Post after it was declassified, a prosecutor who confronted Lewinsky 'exercised poor judgment and made mistakes in his analysis, planning and execution of the approach.' 

Written by two lawyers charged with investigating the affair by Robert W. Ray, Starr's successor as independent counsel, concluded that the 'matter could have been handled better.'

It also asserted that the interrogation quickly went into a tailspin as Lewinsky - barred from calling her lawyer or parents - grew increasingly hysterical. 

It said that when the agents first approached her in the food hall and asked for her cooperation she told them to 'go f*** yourself'. But after they persisted she finally agreed to talk to them.

Ken Gormley, dean of Duquesne University's law school and author of 'The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,' said that the report is one of the few key documents from the Lewinsky episode that had not been made public.

Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia 

He said it is 'an important piece of history' that 'finally vindicates that [Lewinsky's] version of events checks out.'

'One person people seem to forget a lot about during this crisis for our country was Monica Lewinsky,' Gormley told the Post, 'She was just this foil in the clash between Clinton and Starr. 

Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment.

After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.'

'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. 

'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' 

She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black.

She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence.  

'I have observed that as more information has gotten into the public domain, that people grow more sympathetic with her position, which was unwinnable.' 

The report concluded: 'We find that OIC conduct was influenced, and indeed largely driven, by the poor judgment Michael Emmick (the lead prosecutor on the scene) exhibited in his formulation and execution of the approach to achieve Lewinsky's cooperation.

'The Department requires far greater respect for an individual's choice of attorney, for attorney-client relationships, and for the role of defense attorneys in the process than that exemplified in this case.'

It comes as Lewinsky used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying as she described her vilification following the Clinton scandal.

She joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the 'scourge of harassment in the digital age.'

'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,' Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop.

Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. 

'Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,' Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion. 

'I lost my public self, or had it stolen,' she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late-night comics. 'In a way, it was a form of identity theft. 

'In 1998, 'public Monica, that Monica, that woman' was born. I was publicly identified and someone I did not recognize.' 

Looking back on her experiences, Lewinsky explained to the 20- and 30-somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s, there were 'gossip, news and entertainment websites' that latched onto the Clinton scandal, relishing each detail with gusto.

'Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went,' she recalled, according to Forbes. 'A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly 'social media.''
