A coroner burst into tears after hearing how a Special Forces officer was shot dead during a botched raid on a Taliban compound.

He said that Captain Richard Holloway’s parents should be proud of their son who ‘died with a rifle in his hand doing a job that he loved and protecting freedom’.

An inquest into the officer’s death two days before Christmas Day last year heard dramatic details about the night-time ambush of the Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan.

The Special Boat Service solider was hit by two Kalashnikov bullets fired by a waiting enemy soldier as the elite team approached the compound.

Capt Holloway’s commanding officer rushed to help his colleague as gunmen continued to spray bullets in their direction.

He lifted the 29-year-old and carried him down the mountain on his back, but his valiant efforts were in vain as Capt Holloway was already dead.

Coroner Andrew Tweddle broke down in tears later in the inquest as he  recalled the death of his own son in a car crash.

Addressing Capt Holloway’s parents Neil and Jacquie the coroner said: ‘He died with a rifle in his hand, doing a job he loved and protecting freedom. I have difficulty saying this.

‘My son died some years ago in a car crash. If someone had said to me what that officer had said, I would feel very proud.’

Mr Tweddle concluded that Capt Holloway died from gunshot wounds sustained while on active operational duty in Afghanistan.

Capt Holloway’s family, from Hamsterley, Durham, were also reduced to tears at the conclusion of the hearing. 

The disastrous raid, in which the team was reportedly targeting a Taliban commander, has previously been described as an ‘embarrassing failure’.  

As well as capturing an array of specialist equipment, including assault rifles, grenades and a night vision camera, the insurgents also injured another soldier.

The animal - named DaGarwal, the Pashto for Colonel - became an unlikely prisoner of war when it was paraded as a trophy by bearded gunmen following the attack. 

The raid was carried out by a Special Forces unit called Task Force 42, which includes members of the SBS and SAS.

Troops travelled to the compound, located outside Kabul, on Chinook helicopters but were immediately ambushed by a large group of opposition fighters.

As the intense firefight broke out, Capt Holloway was hit in the thigh and pelvis, before the soldiers eventually retreated. 

His commanding officer, who was referred to during the inquest in Crook, County Durham, as Officer C described carrying him off the mountain.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, he said: ‘Rich died with a rifle in his hand, he died doing the job that he absolutely loved and he died protecting the freedoms the Afghan people enjoyed, like the people in the UK.’

 Before joining the Special Forces, the soldier was part of the Royal Engineers.

Paying tribute after his death, his parents, brother Luke and girlfriend Sandy described him as a ‘perfectionist’ and ‘exceptional young man’.

They said: ‘He was a dedicated and totally committed member of the armed forces, relishing the excitement and challenge but always serious and reflective about his duties and responsibilities to those with whom he served.

‘Wherever the action was, he wanted to be part of it - and that is where our beloved son, of whom we are so very proud, lost his life.’

His commanding officer, who was not named, also called him a ‘natural leader’ who was ‘revered by the Afghans whom he mentored tirelessly’ after the incident.

He added: ‘His tactical ability commanded wide respect; his judgment was un-erring, his enthusiasm was infectious and his standards never dropped.

Former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also said at the time: 'It is clear from the tributes that have been paid to him that he was an officer who set the highest of standards and was liked and respected in equal measure by his colleagues and commanders.

'His great contribution and, indeed, his sacrifice will not be forgotten. 

'My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Captain Holloway’s family, friends and colleagues at this most difficult time.' 

Hundreds of mourners lined the streets of Durham in silence to pay their respects at Captain Holloway's funeral, which was held at the city's cathedral in January. 

At the start of the inquest Mr Tweddle said the Ministry of Defence had made an application to him for Officer C’s evidence to be made from behind a screen so he could not be identified, having regard to ‘the operational effectiveness of the UK Special Forces’.
