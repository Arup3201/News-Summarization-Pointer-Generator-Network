We've long been told that the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes is obesity. 

Now, however, scientists have discovered a lack of sunshine increases the risk of diabetes more than weight.

A new study has warned people who have low levels of vitamin D are more likely to be obese and more likely to have type 2 diabetes.

They are also more likely than people with normal vitamin D levels to have pre-diabetes - a condition which means a person's blood sugar is elevated.

If left untreated, they are likely to develop type 2 diabetes within a decade.

A lack of the 'sunshine' vitamin D - rather than being obese -  raises the risk of diabetes, researchers say. The vitamin plays a role in how the body metabolises sugar

Their risk of metabolic syndrome - a medical term for a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity - is also increased.

Metabolic syndrome puts a person at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels.

The new Spanish study found it was a deficiency in vitamin D - dubbed the 'sunshine vitamin' - rather than what a person weighs that increased their risk of diabetes.

This is because there was a direct link between low vitamin D levels and how the body metabolised glucose.

Obese people who did not have diabetes or another blood sugar disorder had higher levels of vitamin D than the participants with diabetes.

Likewise, lean participants with diabetes or another pre-diabetes disorder were more likely to have low levels of the nutrient.

Vitamin D helps control calcium that keeps bones and muscles healthy and regulates the immune system, which could help prevent diseases such as eczema and asthma.

Vitamin D is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight, but small amounts are also found in foods like eggs and oily fish. One billion people worldwide are estimated to be deficient in the nutrient

Most of the nutrient is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight, but small amounts are also found in foods like vitamin-D-fortified milk, oily fish and eggs.

Yet one billion people worldwide are estimated to have deficient levels of vitamin D due to a lack of exposure to sunshine.

Dr Manuel Macías-González, of the University of Malaga, Spain, said: 'Our findings indicate that vitamin D is associated more closely with glucose metabolism than obesity.

The number of children with vitamin D deficiency has soared by more than 200 per cent in five years because parents are unaware how important it is for health, a study revealed.

It also exposed a ‘worrying’ lack of knowledge by GPs and health workers about the Government’s guidelines on the vitamin.

Public health officials are advising parents to give their children supplements and fortified foods.

This is to avoid a return to ‘Victorian’ levels of vitamin D deficiency, when the bone-softening disease rickets was common, they said.

Foods such as oily fish, eggs and mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D, but many cereals and some dairy products are fortified with the vitamin. 

Skin exposure to sunlight from March to October also produces vitamin D. 

'The study suggests that vitamin D deficiency and obesity interact synergistically to heighten the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders.

'The average person may be able to reduce their risk by maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough outdoor activity.'

The study, published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, clarifies the connection between vitamin D, obesity and diabetes.

Mercedes Clemente-Postigo, of the same university, added: 'The major strength of this study is that it compares vitamin D levels in people at a wide range of weights, from lean to morbidly obese subjects, while taking whether they had diabetes into account.'

It compared vitamin D biomarkers in 148 participants who had their BMI measured and tested for diabetes, pre-diabetes or no blood sugar disorders.

Researchers measured levels of vitamin D in the participants' bloodstreams and levels in fat tissue.

Obese people who did not have glucose metabolism disorders had higher levels of vitamin D than those who were diabetic. 

Lean people with diabetes or another glucose metabolism disorder were more likely to have low levels of vitamin D.

Therefore, vitamin D levels were directly correlated with glucose levels, but not with BMI, the researchers concluded.
