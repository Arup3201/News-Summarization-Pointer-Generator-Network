A sex party dubbed ‘dirty Downton’ which was due to be held at a prestigious British manor house has been cancelled, after the historic property was taken over by new owners.

Bovey Castle, a 64-bedroom retreat in Devon, was to host five nights of naked pool parties and sex shows next summer.

Adult travel company shoesonly.com had hired the Grade II-listed manor house for its event, which had been billed as ‘Downton Abbey, only sexier’.

But a hotel chain has since taken over the 100-year-old property and they say the raunchy antics conflict with their ‘core values’.

US company Shoes Only chose the period drama-style setting because it is ‘steeped in romantic literature, a place of striking beauty and romance’.

But a spokesperson for Eden Hotel Collection said: ‘The booking was made as we were acquiring the hotel earlier this summer and at the time we were unaware of the precise details of the proposed event.

‘Having investigated further, we have taken the decision that the event in no way fits with the core values of our businesses and have taken immediate steps to cancel the booking.

Bovey Castle was built in 1907 on the banks of the river Bovey for the second Viscount Hambleden, William Frederick Danvers Smith, but is now a luxury hotel and golf course

‘Bovey Castle has always been a hugely popular destination for families and as the new custodians of the hotel we are very keen to maintain this and further enhance the experience for our customers.’

Bovey Castle was built in 1907 on the banks of the river Bovey for the second Viscount Hambleden, William Frederick Danvers Smith, but is now a luxury hotel and golf course.

The castle has hosted regular guests since 1930, when it was turned into a hotel by the Great Western Railway, before being sold to the British Transport Commission in 1948.

In the 1990s entrepreneur Peter de Savary refurbished the 64-bed retreat.

It was in September this year when it was revealed that Shoes Only had booked out the castle for summer 2015, shortly after hosting a similar event in July this year.

Around 100 couples had paid up to £4,800 to enjoy seedy romps inside the Jacobean-style manor and its 275-acre grounds.

Swingers who signed up for the event were also offered free cream teas with regulars to the site able to get discounts through the Lusty Loyalty Program.

At the time of advertising the event, the US firm's website boasted: 'We have arranged a private takeover of one of England's most spectacular and luxurious Castle Estates. Think a sexy and erotic Downton Abbey.

'Situated on 275 plush English green acres, our castle offers a dazzling array of pampering pleasures and exciting activities.

'We dare say that few have experienced the English Countryside in as romantic and sensuous a fashion that our 'Pleasure Castle' adventure in July 2015 will offer.

The real Downton Abbey (actually Highchele Castle: pictured) is not affiliated with the event, but the American travel company had hoped to draw on the glamour of the era

'Not only will all of the wonderful delights of the Castle be available to you but each day and evening will be filled with sensuous, fun and titillating events by day and night.'

The five-day night party includes a 'sexy Renaissance fair on the lawn' and an 'erotic Au Natural closest to the pin challenge' and even an erotic golf competition.

Guests can also enjoy tennis, hunting, fishing, an historic tour of nearby Exeter - as well as 'multiple playhouses including one with a dungeon and mistress'.

Shoesonlytravel.com, which prides itself on delivering 'classy nude and swinger vacations', defended the party as a private event for 'serious' travellers.

A spokesman said: 'Our criteria in selecting venues is to find beautiful five-star properties around the world which offer our members, who are all serious travellers, the opportunity to explore and visit wonderful and interesting places in a private setting.'
