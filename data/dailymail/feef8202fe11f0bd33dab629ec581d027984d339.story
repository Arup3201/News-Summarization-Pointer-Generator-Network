Apple and Samsung made bets on fingerprint scanning for their flagship phones but Fujitsu is taking a different route.

The Japanese firm has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes.

And its prototype can be used to log into Facebook, email or other web services.

Japanese firm Fujitsu has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes. The prototype (pictured) can be used to log into Facebook, email or other web services

The demo of the prototype is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

‘Fujitsu’s new authentication method uses iris recognition, which is hard to forge and convenient to use,’ the firm told MailOnline.

‘The screen can be unlocked simply by looking at it, which eliminates the trouble of having to use [your] hands when wearing gloves and can’t use a fingerprint.’

The end of the password? For its prototype (demo pictured), Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone.It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera

Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera.

Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina

These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology.

It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris.

The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge.

It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera.

This pattern is registered and linked to the user.

Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device.

‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline

‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require.

‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’

Iris authentication is a type of biometric authentication, similar to fingerprint scanners.

It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris, which is the ring around the pupil of the eye.

Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology.

It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices.

This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example.

Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with.

Previous versions of similar technology have been larger or not powerful enough for phones and tablets.

Fujitsu’s technology recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera.

This pattern is registered and linked to the user and each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device.

Fujitsu told MailOnline the sensor will work from ‘a standard smartphone viewing distance’, which is said to be up to 9 inches (22cm).

Traditional iris authentication systems work up to 3inches (10cm), for example.
