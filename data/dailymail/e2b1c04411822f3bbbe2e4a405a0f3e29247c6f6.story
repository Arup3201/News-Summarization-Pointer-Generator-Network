An Englishman's home may be his castle but this American's home genuinely is a fortress.

Brent Snr began constructing his own castle deep in the Appalachian Mountains of Carolina back in 1999 to protect his family from marauding hordes.

The father-of-ten believes that one day there will be a massive electromagnetic pulse, caused by either a solar flare or nuclear explosion, which will be so devastating it will shut down power across the world and throw society back hundreds of years to the Dark Ages.

Protection: Brent Snr believes the castle will protect them if civilisation is on the brink of collapse

Called Doomsday Castle, he and five of his children are now the subject of a new real life documentary series from the National Geographic Channel.

The show follows Brent Snr and five of his children as he puts the finishing touches to his fortress, which comes complete with a drawbridge, portcullis, battlements a giant catapult and a battering ram, in case they ever come under siege.

None of the family divulge their surnames and the castle's precise location is being kept a closely guarded secret.

Brent Snr told the show, which first aired on Tuesday, that in 1859 a solar flare wiped out the world's telegraph system.

He said: 'If that solar flare were to happen today it would destroy not only the US, but the world, and would put us back to the Dark Ages.

'That's a natural disaster that we've got no control over.'

In an interview with LiveScience he further elaborated on his theory which he says came to him amid the Y2K furore.

'I was worried the computers that control everything, from natural gas to electricity, would go down. When they didn't, I cooled off for a couple years because I didn't want people to think I was crazy, but then got back into it,' he said.

'A man with 10 kids has a godly obligation to take care of his children, and I've set up a 100-year trust so the castle can't be sold. Each kid will get the castle for five weeks every year.'

As the castle's imposing architect, the former army infantry training officer cuts a scary sight in full combat gear, however, he insists his project is about caring rather than anything violent.

Responding to skepticism around his theory, the father-of-10 adds: 'It's a real possibility. Nuclear explosions can create EMPs — if one was detonated in the high atmosphere, it could knock out power to one-fourth of the United States by destroying computers that run everything. Solar flares are also a risk for EMPs.

'Most people have enough food for about 10 days. If there are no trucks to replenish the food supply, though, that's a major problem. If the government isn't there to help them out, fighting and looting will eventually start — like you saw during Hurricane Katrina — and could eventually reach the countryside.

'The calmest person in the world will turn into a savage if he sees his baby crying and his children go hungry. I built the castle to defend against marauders and to have a place that could function without electricity.' 

His son Michael adds: 'We believe in the bible. [Armageddon] may not be in my father's time or our time but it may be in my kids time.'

His twin Dawn-Marie adds: 'Ever since I was little I have heard my dad talk about the castle - 'when's it going to get finished, how's it going to get finished'. He wants things to be done his way and he wants it done in a timely manner.'

'I know there's people who look at us and at my father and say 'this man's crazy' but it's the one thing he wants done before he dies and I am determined to play my part.'

'Ever since we were little my dad has put a crossbow in our hand, put a gun. I think the first time I held a gun I was probably six years old. He has taught me pretty every tool in the toolbox.'

Among his feats of strength Brent can be seen felling trees the old fashioned way with nothing more than an axe.

His five children have been trained in 
how to use bow and arrows effectively, and in one scene the five adults 
are filmed running through the woods armed with various lethal weapons, 
including a hatchet.

End in sight? Brent Snr has made the castle his life's work

In another scene, called The Army of Armageddon, Brent Snr plans a surprise attack on the castle, carried out by 20 of his friends, to demonstrate to how vulnerable it is.

The marauders, who are armed with paintball guns, arrive in trucks and start letting off explosions and smoke bombs to disorientate his offspring.

The family panic and can be seen running through the castle like scared 'mice'.

One by one they are brought down by their assailants, who also have German Shepherds with them.

Two of the girls jump out of the windows, but one is quickly apprehended. Another makes it into the woods, but is later caught by a man on a quad bike.

'None of them escaped,' said Brent Snr ruefully.
