Thanks to stylish gym bunnies such as Rosie Huntington Whiteley and Millie Mackintosh, sexy sportswear has become de 
rigueur as women strive to impress their classmates.

And now, one lingerie company is attempting to turn the gym into a Victoria's Secret catwalk with its latest offering.

Gossard has just unveiled its first-ever sports bra, which the brand promise will 'transform your work out from functional to fashionable.'

Fashion statement: Lingerie label Gossard has unveiled its first cleavage-enhancing sports bra

The £39 bra, which is available in black or neon pink, comes with a 'cleavage-enhancing' cup, underwire, breathable cups and a 'sexy plunge mesh detail'.

'Just because you’re working out doesn’t mean you should settle for anything less than fabulous in the fashion stakes,' says the brand.

'This gorgeous new bra does everything your sports bra does whilst performing like your fashion bra when it comes to aesthetics and cleavage-boosting qualities

'Whether you’re jogging in the park, pumping iron in the gym, or enjoying a relaxing yoga class, the Gossard sports bra promises stunning shape, superior support and sensational comfort,' they add.

A spokesperson for Gossard said: 'This bra is a revolution for women who like to work out whilst looking good.

'For years there has been nothing on the market for the fashionista who wants to combine on-trend style with the more practical need to protect your boobs whilst exercising.'
