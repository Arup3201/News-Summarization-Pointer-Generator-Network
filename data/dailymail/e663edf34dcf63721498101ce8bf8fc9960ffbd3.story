Ministers are examining proposals to create a new British Sikh regiment, reminiscent of the ones that fought in both world wars, it has emerged.

Speaking yesterday in Parliament, former defence minister Sir Nicholas Soames urged the Government to ‘do away with political correctness’, praising ‘the extraordinary gallant and distinguished service by Sikhs to this country down the generations’.

And Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, asked Armed Forces minister Mark Francois to look at a Sikh company within the reserves ‘as a starting point’.

Mr Francois said he believes the plan – which was dropped by the Ministry of Defence in 2007 for fear of being branded racist – ‘may well have merit’.

And the Tory frontbencher went on to reveal that the suggestion was being ‘looked at’, saying the proposed regiment would inherit many ‘proud traditions of Sikh regiments’ from the Army’s past.

Mr Soames told him: ‘You will be aware of the extraordinary gallant and distinguished service by Sikhs to this country down the generations.

‘Would you not agree with me that it’s high time to do away with the political correctness which infects some of this thinking and actually raise a Sikh regiment to serve in the country and make up a very serious gap in our Armed Forces?’

In 2007 defence chiefs abandoned plans to create a regiment of British Sikhs after talks with the Commission for Racial Equality.

Sikh leaders informed recruitment officers that they could easily find enough volunteers to form a 700-strong regiment.

But Lieutenant General Sir Freddie Viggers – who was responsible for recruitment at the time – is understood to have accepted race commissioners’ argument that creating the regiment would amount to ‘segregation’.

Leaders of Britain’s 500,000 Sikhs were supportive of the idea of a new regiment, arguing that it would be no different from the Scots, Welsh and Irish Guards or the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which recruits exclusively from Nepal and which is regarded as a model infantry regiment.

The decision to shelve the plans was at the time criticised by politicians, members of the Sikh community and soldiers, who claimed that the Army had fallen victim to political correctness.

Kuljit Singh Gulati, the general secretary of the Sikh Temple in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, said: ‘The Sikhs have a long and distinguished heritage of serving with the British Army.

‘I know there are many, many Sikhs who would join up and would serve wherever required.

'But if you want to get them in large numbers they need their own regiment, something they would take a huge amount of pride in.

‘They would regard it as very prestigious. It is a shame that it now looks as though it will never happen.’

Prince Charles has previously expressed an interest in the creation of dedicated units to boost the number of people from ethnic minorities in the services and to harness the military tradition of the Sikh faith in particular. 

The move comes after the Ministry of Defence  revealed plans to try and recruit more Muslims and ethnic minorities into the army after the rise of Islamic State and massacre in Paris.

Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers.
