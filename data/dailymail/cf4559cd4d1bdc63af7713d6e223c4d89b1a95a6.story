An Uttar Pradesh cleric has offered a reward of Rs 51 crore to 'any 'individual or organisation' behind the attack on French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were brutally slain by masked gunmen.

Addressing journalists in Meerut on Wednesday evening, Haji Yaqub Qureshi, who is also a former state government minister, said: “Any work against religion and the Prophet must not be tolerated at any cost. The French magazine was continuously committing a crime by targeting religion. This was the reason that its office was attacked and journalists were killed. We will give a reward of Rs 51 crore to any individual or organisation which comes forward and claims that they executed this attack.”

He added: “Whatever happened in Paris was absolutely justified.”

Later, Qureshi claimed his statement had been twisted - but didn't deny that he had supported the terrorist attack.

Reactions 

Reacting to his outburst, Naib Sheher Qazi of Meerut Jenur Rashideen said: “There is no place for terrorists in Islam. Those who are making wild statements to laud the attack on the French weekly must be condemned.” 

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Uttar Pradesh spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said: “The government must register a case against Qureshi and arrest him. He has been trying to terrorise society. His only place is in jail.” 

Known for declaring himself the most popular Muslim politician of India, the 54-year-old Qureshi has been dubbed a megalomaniac by many.

The controversial cleric was once a poster boy of Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party (SP), Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and former prime minister late Vishwanath Pratap Singh’s Jan Morcha.

Qureshi, who is always clad in terry-cotton fabric and sports white sneakers with a loose beard, hit the headlines on February 17, 2006 when he announced at a Friday prayer in Meerut that he would give Rs 51 crore to anyone for beheading a Danish cartoonist whose caricature of Prophet Mohammad had appeared in a newspaper in Denmark.

At that time, Qureshi was Minister of State for Minority Welfare and Haj in the Mulayam government. 

The politician again hogged the limelight when he was caught travelling without a train ticket on September 16, 2007 and attacked the railway authorities when they sought his ticket or pass. 

He was let off after paying a fine of Rs 14,056. During those days, he was often heard saying at public meetings: “As of date, I am the most known international Muslim leader.” 

He won the Meerut Assembly seat in 2007 on a United Democratic Front (UDF) ticket and then merged it with the BSP.

Although he was known for having little control over his speeches, BSP chief Mayawati somehow managed to contain him for a while. 

However,  in 2011 he caused controversy again by making a derogatory remark against the Sikh community. This infuriated the Dalit leader, who declared that she had suspended him from the party. 

The suspension proved short-lived, as Mayawati  fielded Qureshi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Moradabad with the hope that Muslim votes would take him to victory. In fact, he lost that election.  

Meanwhile, Omkar Singh, senior superintendent of police, Meerut, has said that they have started a probe into Qureshi’s statement.
