A teenager has become one of the fastest British men of all time just seven months after taking up professional running

And he thinks he could run even faster at this year's Olympics - where he faces the prospect of lining up against reigning champion and world record holder Usain Bolt.

College student Adam Gemili smashed the 100 metres World Junior Championships record as he won gold in Barcelona last night after just a few months of serious training.

His time of 10.05sec makes him the fastest British junior of all time - even beating Dwain 
Chambers' British junior record of 10.06sec in 1997 and the previous championship record set by Trinidadian Darrel Brown in 2002.

Golden boy: Adam Gemili from London ran the 100m in a remarkable 10.05second last night

Proof! Gemili stands next to his record breaking time and means he's one to watch at the Olympics

The Londoner, who is currently studying a BTEC diploma in sport at Barking and Dagenham College, only quit football last November to focus on running.

Before that the teenager's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track.

The former Dartford Grammar School pupil -  who is of Moroccan and Iranian descent - was signed up by Chelsea when he was just eight years old and spent seven years with the European Champions before switching to his local club Dagenham and Redbridge.

He spent part of last season on loan at nearby Blue Square Bet South side Thurrock, but was still training with Dagenham and Redbridge until the end of the year.

Gemili said last year that football would always come first but now he is less sure.

His remarkable win makes him one to watch at the London Olympics in two weeks time where he will compete in the 100 metres and the 4x100 metres relay.

Posting on Twitter this morning, Mr Gemili said: 'Literally the happiest guy in the world right now. Months of hard work have paid off and I'm now World Junior Champion!'

Speaking about his surprise win yesterday, he said: 'This is a massive stepping stone. It will help me a lot. I never thought I'd be a junior world champion.

'I was nervous. A world 
junior final in Barcelona, who's not going to be nervous? You've got to 
try to use the nerves in a good way, try to put them towards my run - 
and I did.

'I was trying to stay relaxed. I know if I tighten up I don't
 run as quickly so I was trying to stay relaxed and focused and enjoy 
the race'.

The 18-year-old was 0.12secs
 quicker than Aaron Ernest from the United States while Jamaica's Odean 
Skeen came third in a time of 10.28.

He also beat his previous best of 10.08, which he clocked in a low-key race in 
Germany last month.

The phenomenal run took place in the same Montjuic Stadium 
where Linford Christie became the oldest man and last Briton to win 100m gold at the 1992 Olympics aged 32.

Christophe Lemaitre is the only European athlete to beat his Gemili's time this 
year, with the Frenchman running 10.04secs in Rome in May.

Gemili hopes he can continue to improve and hinted he could run even faster in London.

When asked if he thinks he can clock a sub-10sec time, he added: 'I 
honestly do not know. I am feeling good and I am running well, I just 
feel there is a whole lot more to come.'

The 10-second barrier has 
historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best
 female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race.

The current men's world record is 
9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt while American Florence 
Griffith-Joyner holds the women's world record of 10.49 seconds.

Easy: Gemili cruised to victory in both the semi-final and final becoming one of the fastest ever Brits

Nippy: The youngster beat his previous best of 10.08, which he clocked in a low-key race in 
Germany last month
