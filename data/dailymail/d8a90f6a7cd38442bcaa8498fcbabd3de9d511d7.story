Steve Bruce insists Hull City must accept they will be one of the teams involved in this season’s relegation scrap.

The Tigers enjoyed their first win in 11 at Bruce’s former club Sunderland on Boxing Day to climb out of the drop zone.

They now have the chance to put nine points between themselves and bottom club Leicester City, who visit the KC Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Hull have the opportunity to put nine points between themselves and bottom club Leicester with a win

Hull (4-4-2): McGregor; Elmohamaday, Bruce, Davies, Rosenior; Brady, Livermore, Meyler, Quinn; Ramirez; Aluko 

And Bruce said: ‘It’s a bigger game for me than the cup final. Yes, I know that’s quite a statement, but that’s what it means to me.

‘If we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it’ s a big turnaround to be caught.

‘As we’ve seen, it’s been difficult enough to win one or two games, let alone turn around a three-game swing.’ 

He added: ‘We’ve only been in the division a total of four years in our history so we’re going to be in and around it at the bottom. We always expected to be.

James Chester is suspended, as is midfielder Tom Huddlestone, but Jake Livermore returns from his ban. 

Steve Bruce must decide whether to recall Nikica Jelavic - who scored in the win at Sunderland - or keep faith with Sone Aluko. 

‘The league is starting to take shape at halfway. The teams you think are going to be at the top are there – with one or two surprises like there always is.

‘And I could have called the bottom eight – and we have to accept we are going to be one of them.’ 

Gaston Ramirez scored his first for the club during the 3-1 win at Sunderland, and Bruce believes only now are they starting to see the best of the Uruguayan playmaker.

‘We got him on loan from Southampton after he went there for £12million and it does take them time,’ he said.

'At Sunderland, he looked a really good player because he’s been given time to adjust to the food, the culture, the cold and the language barrier. We have to let him adjust and find his way.’
