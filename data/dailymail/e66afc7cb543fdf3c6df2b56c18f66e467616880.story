A Pennsylvania couple have opened up about the grim hoarding habit that is tearing them apart.

Kyle and Lynn are the latest subjects of TLC's 'Hoarding: Buried Alive' and have told the reality TV show that, while they have been together for years, their relationship is now a big mess.

The once-happy pair moved into Kyle's four-bedroom duplex outside of Pittsburgh three years ago, and he had grand renovation plans.

'When I first moved in, it wasn't really my dream home, but I had a lot of ideas of how I'd like to fix it up,' he said in a clip of the episode aired on TODAY. He added that he initially wanted to live in one unit and rent out the other.

But those plans were scuppered when Lynn's trash and so-called treasures began cluttering up every room.

'This is kind of a front room/living room,' Lynn said as she attempted to give a tour of the place. 'I'm not sure what you'd call it.'

Kyle described the room as 'where I used to be able to watch TV before this mess got so bad.'

But while the collectibles all belong to Lynn, she blamed Kyle for the mess because he won't 'take the frickin' garbage out.' She also plucked a snow globe off the heaped floor and again said it was her boyfriend's fault.

'It's something that has to be put on a shelf in here, if I can get my shelves put up,' she snapped.

He shook his head, insisting it was Lynn's compulsive shopping that had resulted in the mounds of trash.

She disagreed but not even Kyle could understand her response.

'I couldn't understand a word you said, and I'm sure no one else could either,' he said.

Throughout the episode, which airs Wednesday at 10 p.m., subtitles are used so viewers can understand what Lynn is saying. Later on, it becomes clear why.

'I'm missing my teeth,' Lynn said of her dentures. 'I lost them. ... Somewhere, like around here, are my teeth,' she adds looking at the floor.
