An ambulance crew left the body of a dead man on the floor rather than take it to a mortuary, so they could finish their shift on time, an inquest has heard.

James Harrison collapsed and died in a Cambridgeshire street in the early hours of September 24.

The crew - who were due to finish their night shift at 6am - arrived at the scene at 5.30am, after he was found by a milkman.

They were unable to save him, an inquest held in Chatteris,Cambridgeshire, heard today. 

Instead of extending their 15-hour shift to transport Mr Harrison's body to the mortuary at Addenbrooke's hospital, the crew took him to nearby Ely ambulance station and left the body to be collected by an undertaker.

The undertaker never arrived and it was not until after 8am that another ambulance crew was sent to take him to hospital.

The ambulance crew, who were from across the border in Norfolk, claim they were told by colleagues it was 'common practice' in the Ely area to leave deceased bodies at the ambulance station - providing there was police consent.

An inquest into the death of James Harrison, 32, found his body was taken to Ely ambulance station and left overnight after he died and collapsed in a Cambridgeshire street on September 24

Opening the inquest, coroner William Morris rejected an application from lawyers for the East of England Ambulance Service to restrict the inquest to the death itself and not the circumstances which followed.

He said it was in the public interest to consider the 'indignity, distress and possibility of forensic evidence being compromised' by the delays.

Mr Morris concluded that Mr Harrison's death was an accident, the result of taking a cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants and insomnia medication.

Paramedic Steve Hibbitt, who investigated the incident, said crews in that area had failed to take bodies straight to hospital on seven previous occasions.

On two occasions bodies had been left on the floor and on five occasions in the back of an ambulance.

The inquest heard paramedics David Glenton and Ann-Marie Poole from 30 miles away in Downham Market, Norfolk, attended the incident along with first responder Dharamendra Narotam.

Mr Harrison was pronounced dead at 5.53am - just before Mr Glenton and Ms Poole were due to finish their shift.

Despite the fact they were already working overtime, the pair said they were happy to transport the body to hospital, Mr Hibbitt said.

But Mr Narotam suggested the body could be left at the ambulance station and collected later.

Mr Glenton did not question this decision.

He told the inquest: 'He made it sound like it was common practice.'

Mr Hibbitt added: 'The crew were not familiar with this procedure but were advised it was a normal local practice and several bodies had been left in this way before.

'The responder did not feel he was doing anything inappropriate and that he was doing something respectful by covering him in clean sheets.'

The inquest heard the ambulance crew were due to finish their 15-hour shift but were prepared to take Mr Harrison's body to the mortuary at Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured). But instead, a colleague told them it was 'common practice' to leave bodies at the station 

East of England ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients’ lives to meet response time targets.

The trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent.

This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes.

East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year.

At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a ‘do not resuscitate’ order.

It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases.

Managers made the calls ‘non-urgent’ when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window.

Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: ‘They are playing Russian roulette with patients’ lives.

‘What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients’ quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later.

‘Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones’ lives could have been extended by a few months.’

An internal investigation by East of England Ambulance Service found that in January and February last year managers agreed to downgrade calls involving terminally ill patients.

Rather than being sent an ambulance within eight minutes, these patients were made to wait between 20 and 50 minutes. And in some cases ambulances crews were not sent at all and relatives were just given advice on the phone.

The guidance had not been approved by the trust’s most senior management and was flagged up by concerned staff. Anthony Marsh, the ambulance service’s chief executive, said he immediately launched an investigation and ordered the reversal of the changes.

He explained it was not ambulance service policy to do this but it was not uncommon for local crews to follow different and sometimes outdated procedures which also depend on police and coroner's practices.

'This may be due to lack of knowledge of accepted practice but may also be due to staff taking short cuts,' he said. 

Mr Narotam said police agreed with the decision to leave the body at the station.

He said: 'I suggested that that we move the body out of the public eye and place it at Ely Ambulance Station if they were happy with that.

'There were many police officers of different ranks on duty.

'I mentioned that in the past we had removed deceased bodies back to Ely Ambulance Station without any problems.

'It was agreed with the police that we would do that. On arrival I opened the garage doors so the ambulance could back up to it.

'I put out clean sheets on the garage floor so we could out the deceased body bag onto it and covered it.

'At no point was the deceased left alone.

'The ambulance crew finished their shift at 6am. I believe the crew would not have had an issue had they have been asked to drop the body off at the mortuary.

'I was planning on taking the body to the mortuary but the day shift crew started at 8am so they were dispatched to take the body.' 

Mr Harrison's family were not informed about the incident until it was reported by the press when a whistle-blower claimed the body had been left by bins at the station.

Mother Diane Harrison said she knew her son was on prescribed medication.

She added: 'I was extremely shocked to learn he was dead.

'He would have not have done this on purpose, he would not have left me on my own.'

Tracy Nicholls, director of clinical quality at the East of England Ambulance Service, said: 'We apologise wholeheartedly to the family for the distress this incident has caused - it should never have happened.

'The trust has carried out a full investigation into this matter and it is clear that incorrect decisions were made and the trust's procedures were not followed.

'As a result of this we immediately sent out an instruction to staff that such a practice is not acceptable and must not happen.'

The members of staff involved are subject to an ongoing investigation, she added.
