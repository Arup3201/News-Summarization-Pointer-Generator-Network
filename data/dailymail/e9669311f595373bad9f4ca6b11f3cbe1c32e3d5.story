Child abuse charges: Pediatrician, Dr Dennis Jones, 68, of Council Bluffs, was arrested in May after a girl, 5, told her parents he 'tortures' her

Police found a ‘shocking amount of child pornography’ in the home of an Iowa doctor who was arrested for sexually abusing a five-year-old girl when she told her mom that he 'tortures' her.

Dr Dennis Seaborn Jones, 68, of Council Bluffs, who has been a pediatrician for 19 years - and has been used in the past as an expert witness in child molestation court cases, giving him access to photographs related to those crimes - was arrested in May after a parent filed a complaint against him.

The complaint came after the child told a parent that she no longer wanted to see Jones because of the ‘torture’ he inflicted. 

Court documents say further 
interviews indicated the child was the subject of inappropriate touching
while watching movies at Jones' home, according to ABC7.

During
the execution of a search warrant at his Skyline Drive home, 
authorities found large amounts of child porn on at least one computer, 
and several more digital items were confiscated.

Scene of the crime: The doctor allegedly touched the girl at his home in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Prosecutors say a 'shocking amount of pornography' was found in his home

That evidence will be allowed to be admitted in court when the case against Jones goes to trial in January.

Late last week, District Court Judge Richard Davidson denied a motion by Jones and his attorney, Mike Winter, to suppress evidence obtained during a search of the doctor's home in May as part of an investigation related to sexual abuse charges against the doctor.

‘A shocking amount,’ wrote Denise 
Timmins, prosecutor for the Iowa Attorney General's Office, which is 
trying the case because Jones has been an expert witness in the past for
the Pottawattamie County Attorney's Office, according to Omaha.com.

Defense attorneys Winter and Angela 
Campbell, had argued that authorities lacked probable cause in executing
a search warrant issued for Jones' Skyline Drive home, three vehicles 
and Jones himself.

Suspended: Jones was put on immediate suspension by Methodist Physicians Clinic-Council officials, where he worked as a pediatrician

Expert witness: Jones has been used in the past as an expert witness in child molestation and child porn court cases, giving him access to photographs related to those crimes

However, the Attorney General's Office argued that a suspect alleged to have sexually abused a child has a propensity to possess child pornography.

During the search of Jones' home, authorities seized two desktop computers and eight hard drives, including at least five external hard drives. It's unclear how many pornography files were seized or the nature of the pornography.

At the time of his arrest in May, Winter said the doctor was ‘devastated’ by the charges.

‘He is innocent and he intends to defend himself to the fullest,’ Winter said.

Jones, who worked as a pediatrician at Methodist Physicians Clinic-Council Bluffs, was suspended immediately after his arrest.

Jones is charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a Class B felony, and faces up to 50 years in jail.

His trial is set to begin in early 2014.
