A ten-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl who shot themselves may have intentionally pulled the trigger, police said today.

Kameron Asgari, ten, died from his injuries on Tuesday and the girl, who has not been identified, was left in a critical condition in a separate incident nine hours later.

Both are believed to have found the weapons at their homes in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The children did not know each other, 
according to spokesman Bill Cassell said. It was unknown whether the 
firearms belonged to their parents.

Kameron Asgari, was in the fifth grade at Helen Jydstrup Elementary School in Las Vegas.

It was unclear if he attended school the morning he shot himself, said David Roddy, spokesman for the Clark County School District.

Privacy laws prohibited school officials 
from disclosing whether Kameron had been involved in any disciplinary 
actions or requested counselling before the shooting.

Both incidents are under investigation. The medical examiner has not released an exact cause of death for 
the ten-year-old boy.

Counsellors were supporting Kameron's classmates and teachers.

School officials wrote to parents asking them to keep a close eye on their children's behaviour.

Grieving: Classmates and teachers were being offered counselling at the child's school in Las Vegas, Nevada

In a letter, Principal David Fydman said: 'Please monitor any signs of grief or behavioral changes in your child/children as this loss may affect them in unexpected ways.

'It is important to be honest with him or her and to allow them to express feelings of grief, anger and/or disbelief.

'Reassure your child that there is always someone with whom he/she can talk and that the many mixed emotions they might be feeling, and may feel for some time, are normal.'

Police spokesman Bill Cassell said the shootings should remind gun owners to securely store their weapons and to instruct children to avoid touching any gun found inside the home.

He said: 'When we have the awesome power of a firearm, we have to control it and protect everyone from an unwanted occurrence.'

Kathleen Sandoval, wife of Nevada's governor Brian Sandoval, said people should be made aware of government-backed counseling resources.

Mrs Sandoval said: 'I am extremely saddened to hear recent reports of youth suicide in our state and in our country.'
