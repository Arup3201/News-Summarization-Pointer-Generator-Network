A friendly rivalry has long existed between the U.S. and Canada and many Americans enjoy nothing more than poking fun at their neighboring nation.

But, with the exception of the War of 1812 two centuries ago, the two countries have stood side-by-side and are today the world's largest trading partners.

In a further boost to this mutual love-in, a poll has - rather surprisingly -  revealed that Americans rate Canada as their favourite country.

A landslide 96 per cent of U.S. citizens surveyed rate Canada favourably, a four per cent rise on this time last year.

Border crossing: Americans rate Canada as their favourite country, with 96 per cent signalling their approval for their next-door neighbour, according to a poll

More surprisingly, Australia came second in the Gallup poll with a 93 per cent approval rating.

Britain rounded out the top three, proving that the enduring 
'special relationship' between the U.S. and UK is supported by the 
American public too.

Germany and Japan came fourth and 
fifth respectively, followed by another unexpected choice in sixth place
with 75 per cent approval - France.

It has been less than ten years since relations between the U.S. and France were at a low.

In the second Gulf war against Iraq, 
the U.S. dubbed the French ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’ and 
re-branded French Fries as ‘Freedom Fries’ when the nation failed to 
support the 2003 invasion.

Popularity contest: Iran came bottom in the Gallup poll, hardly surprising considering the escalating showdown between the Islamic Republic and the West over its nuclear program

Equally surprising is the growth in favourability towards Mexico.

Ravaged by an ongoing war on drug 
gangs that has seen more than 40,000 people killed, six per cent more 
Americans than a year ago approve of the country.

This comes just days after the U.S. State Department this week recommended Americans avoid travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 Mexican 
states in the widest travel advisory since the country stepped up its drug 
war in 2006.

The advisory said U.S. citizens have been victims of drug violence, including killings, kidnappings and car-jackings.

Sydney Harbour: Australia came a surprising second in the survey of American opinions of other nations

Great Britain was named third most popular proving that the enduring 'special relationship' between the U.S. and UK is supported by the American public too

Less surprising are the countries that Americans most dislike.

The escalating showdown between Iran 
and the West over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program has led just 10
per cent of U.S. citizens to view the country favourably.

Second least popular is North Korea, with a 13 per cent approval rating.

A U.S. liaison will hold talks with 
North Korea on its nuclear program in Beijing next week, the first such 
negotiations since the death of the nation's long-time dictator Kim Jong
Il.

North Korea is followed by Afghanistan with 14 per cent approval.

How the American public's opinion of Pakistan, Afghanistan and North Korea has changed over the last decade. Pakistan has fallen three points to 15 per cent in the last year

Pakistan fell three points to 15 per 
cent, a predictable fall in popularity among the American public given 
the circumstances surrounding the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May last
year.

The unilateral American raid which 
killed the world's most wanted man in an army town led to a fresh wave 
of suspicion against Western diplomats by the Pakistani security 
establishment, which was apparently stung by the realisation that the 
CIA agents were operating in the country without its knowledge.

Tension remains after U.S. Defence 
Secretary Leon Panetta last month said Pakistan officials must have 
known that Bin Laden was holed up in a remote compound in Abbottabad.
