Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic is hungry for more after his match-winning double strike against Liverpool.

The Montenegro international is determined to make up for lost time and make his mark with the champions after an injury-ravaged first year at the club.

Jovetic managed just six goals in 18 appearances after his £22million move from Fiorentina last term but is now looking sharp after playing a full part in pre-season.

He underlined that return to form and fitness by scoring two goals in City's 3-1 win over  title rivals Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Monday.

Jovetic said: 'I was happy with pre-season and against Newcastle I played well but didn't score.

'Now I have scored two but I am going to forget this because in five days we have another game against Stoke and it won't be easy.

'This was a victory for the group, the team, and three points is the most important.'

Jovetic pounced on a defensive error by Liverpool debutant Alberto Moreno to fire City ahead after 41 minutes.

He doubled the lead by rounding off a fine move 10 minutes into the second half and Sergio Aguero came off the bench to add City's third after 69 minutes.

Liverpool pulled one back with a late Pablo Zabaleta own goal but City had underlined their superiority by then and the potential significance of a win over last season's runners-up was not lost.

Jovetic told City TV: 'It was a great game against a big team like Liverpool.

'I think we played very well and at the end this was a game of six points.

'I think Liverpool are going to be back for the title. It is important when you play against them to beat them.'

Zabaleta, who could do little about the own goal as Rickie Lambert's header cannoned back into him off Joe Hart, was impressed with Jovetic's contribution.

Full of praise: Defender Pablo Zabaleta paid tribute to Jovetic, and said he is excelling at the moment 

Jovetic missed out last season as Aguero, Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko thrived but Zabaleta believes he can really shine this time.

The Argentinian said: 'I can see him playing really well even in training. He is doing great during the week. He is very hungry to play games this season and score goals.

'We know we have four strikers in the team. We have a very strong squad.

'I think this is great for the team because we are going to play a lot of games this season and I think the manager will rotate players during the games. 

Competition: Jovetic will have to be picked ahead of Edin Dzeko or Aguero if he is to be a regular starter
