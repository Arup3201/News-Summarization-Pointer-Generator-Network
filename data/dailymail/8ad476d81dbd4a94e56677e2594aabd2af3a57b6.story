It's the sort of item that you'd more commonly associate with Ancient Egypt, but the sarcophagus is making a comeback as London runs out of burial space.

Erith Cemetery, in Bexley, south-east London, opened in 1894 but has been closed to fresh earthen burials for 20 years after it ran out of space. However, it has now opened a new memorial terrace.

This has created room for 600 new graves at the site, with the construction of a series of stone mausoleums and sarcophagi on a north-facing slope too steep for conventional burials.

Motif: A former construction engineer who have opted to be laid to rest in a sarcophagus helped design his - and has had the Parachute Regiment insignia carved into it

Purchase: Local resident Doug Taffs, 70, has paid about £35,000 for a 75-year lease on three raised grey granite sarcophagi for he and his family

Doug Taffs, 70, is among those who have opted to be laid to rest in a sarcophagus. He has paid about £35,000 for a 75-year lease on three raised grey granite sarcophagi for he and his family.

The grandfather-of-five, who served as a paratrooper in the Middle East, the Far East and Northern Ireland, said: ‘Before I would have had to go to Welling to be buried. I don't know Welling.

‘I haven't got a clue about Welling and I don't want to go where I'm not used to. I know it doesn't matter by the time you get in there and it seems a bit macabre but I'm delighted with what I've got.’

The former construction engineer has helped design the sarcophagi and has had the Parachute Regiment insignia carved into the central one.

The sarcophagus was used in Ancient Egypt as a stone case for a linen-wrapped mummy.

When a wealthy person died, they were buried in an elaborate and colorful sarcophagus.

Sometimes a mummy would be placed into a series of sarcophagi that fit inside one another.

Ancient Egyptians saw the sarcophagus as being a surrogate body for the dead.

Through the ages sarcophagi have most often been designed to remain above ground, but in Egyptian times some were concealed in tombs.

In royal tombs they were surrounded by food and riches to help the deceased in the afterlife.

Sarcophagi were carved out of wood in the Early Dynastic period (3100 BC to 2686 BC), and stone materials thereafter.

The structure will house him and his wife of five decades Jean, 68, and their daughter Toni, 47. The others are for son Matthew 44 and his wife Claire, 37, and daughter Rebecca Inwood, 36, and her husband Gary, 44.

The Taffs family plot is next to one reserved for the sisters of the La Sainte Union convent, based in Bexleyheath. Mr Taffs added: ‘I've got a few villains on one side and some nuns on the other so I'm in good company.’

Bexley Cemeteries Officer Jo Pardon said Erith Cemetery is the first in the borough to feature above-ground burials. 

The memorial terrace was built by sarcophagus and mausoleum specialists Welters.

Mrs Pardon added: ‘People appreciate they put their own individual slant on the design. Those who have a connection to the cemetery have now been given an opportunity to be laid to rest where they want to be.'

Last month MailOnline reported how the first Neolithic-style burial chamber built in Britain for 5,000 years was set to open - and 45 customers had already paid for their ashes to be stored there. With space initially for 2,400 ‘customers’, people could reserve a slot for £1,000 each.

The tomb, designed by farmer Tim Daw, was positioned to let the midwinter sunrise shine right down the length of the chamber where people’s ashes will be placed in urns set into the walls.
