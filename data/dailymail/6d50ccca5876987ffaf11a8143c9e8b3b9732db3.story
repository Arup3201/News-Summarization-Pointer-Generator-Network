You don't  restrict an artist. He's there to create, to entertain, to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering  how the hell he did it.

Louis van Gaal used Juan Mata as a 'false right winger' at Anfield six days ago, and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by David Moyes and Jose Mourinho.

The  two-time Chelsea Player of the Year showed good things come to those who wait, as Liverpool's 3-4-3 formation that snookered teams from January onward was lost on Manchester United.

It was, if nothing else, unexpected. Mata had gone unused, having played just 15 minutes across four Premier League games in February, and it was reminiscent of his bit-part role at Chelsea.

Mourinho considered Oscar a better fit as his No 10, believing Mata's defensive cover left a lot to be desired. He is not a tackler, nor is he the physical type. You don't buy a Jack Russell Terrier then expect it to behave like an American Pit Bull. Mata is a different breed. What he is, is an architect.

Since the start of the 2011-12 Barclays Premier League season, he has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder. Close behind is Manchester City's David Silva (63) and Yaya Toure (61), then Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard (both 58).

Yet his defensive discipline – or lack thereof – is what Mourinho considered his Achilles heel. It's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles (0.64), clearances (0.16) and duels won (14.29 per cent) per game when he, Silva, Toure, Hazard and Gerrard are compared, but that's not his job.

Mata left Chelsea for United in a £37m switch but manager David Moyes never got his money's worth

Only Silva (365) beats him in chances created out of the entire Premier League since the beginning of 2011-12, but Mata (291) has played 466 fewer minutes.

He's the creative kind, but would most likely still be warming the substitutes' bench at Stamford Bridge had he not swapped south for north.

It was Moyes that bought Mata from Chelsea, phoning him personally to explain what he wanted. Fluidity, assists and goals were the demands, and Mata agreed.

Two days later, he arrived at Carrington – by helicopter, no less – and it was confirmed. Chelsea made a tidy £13.5m from the Mata move.

Shrewd as ever, as they were with David Luiz (£31.6m profit), Andre Schurrle (£4m), Kevin De Bruyne (£11m), Romelu Lukaku (£18m) and Thorgan Hazard (£5.5m), among others. Moyes, however, never got his money's worth.

It was when he left Manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began.

He hadn't kept Sir Alex Ferguson's backroom staff. He failed to replace Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra.

His style of football was cautious, slow and predictable compared to his predecessor's attacking outlook. Another supposed error was wasting £64m on Marouane Fellaini and Mata.

Yet the new man at Manchester United is getting what Moyes couldn't out of both. 

Against Liverpool, Fellaini and Mata covered the most distance (11.6km each) out of everyone.

Mata had more touches (93) than anyone else, made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy, and made Hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player (3).

For a player without a shot on target in the Premier League since December 20, he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry. 

Alberto Moreno, lugging five yards behind for Mata's first and not tracking him for the second, was tormented by the man that goes by 'Johnny Kills' – a suitable nickname handed to him by former Chelsea team-mate Daniel Sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name.

Jan 31 vs Leicester - 13

Feb 8 vs West Ham - 0

Feb 11 vs Burnley - 0

Feb 21 vs Swansea - 11

Feb 28 vs Sunderland - 4

March 4 vs Newcastle - 8

March 15 vs Tottenham - 77

March 22 vs Liverpool - 90

Against Liverpool, right-back Antonio Valencia was used as cover, sprinting up the wing to allow Mata to abandon his post.

Those two exchanged more passes (55) than anyone else on Sunday, and worked in tandem.

Their average positions show Mata (No 8) stayed close to Ander Herrera (No 21), who was equally devastating at Anfield, while Valencia (No 25) pushed up, just short of the half-way line.

Mata played a similar role against Tottenham Hotspur the week before,  as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate. 

But he is not out of the woods yet. Mata is flirting with a first-team place, having replaced an out-of-sorts Angel di Maria, but the trick is to stay there.

He has been crying out for this, ever since he was phased out at Chelsea, and even more so now he has been dropped by Spain.

Mata has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons. Restricted, to say the least, when compared to former Chelsea team-mate Hazard, who has  5,461 minutes and  61 starts.

It's easier said than done to become a must-pick – £37m doesn't buy you that luxury these days.

Can it happen at Manchester United? If Mata can rip teams to shreds as he did against Liverpool, then how can it not? Trouble is, Louis van Gaal – like Jose Mourinho – is a hard man to please.
