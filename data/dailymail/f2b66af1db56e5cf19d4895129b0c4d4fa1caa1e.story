A Mormon doctor in Utah has been found guilty of the 'perfect murder' after forcing his wife to have a facelift so he could give her a lethal cocktail of drugs and then drown her in the bathtub.

Martin MacNeill half-smiled as the jury found him guilty early on Saturday morning of murdering his wife, Michele, six years ago.

Prosecutors claimed the father-of-eight tried to move his mistress into the family home shortly after his wife's death, and a previous lover told the court the doctor had claimed he could kill a person without anyone knowing.

As the verdict was read out at 1.10am his daughters, who had testified against him, let out a cry of relief and cried after winning their long battle to get justice for their mother.

Guilty: Martin MacNeill smiles as he thanks his defense team after he was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice early Saturday morning

'We're
just so happy he 
can't hurt anyone else,' Alexis Somers, one of his older daughters, 
said. 'We miss our mom; we'll never see her again. But that courtroom was
full of so many people who loved her.'The victim's sister, Linda Cluff, added: 
'We're thankful for the prosecutors who did such a good job and to the 
jurors who could see the evidence. We got justice today. I am just 
thrilled.'

Victim: Michele MacNeill's husband was accused of making her have a facelift so he could give her a cocktail of drugs and then her in the bathtub

Martin MacNeill, 57, showed little emotion when the verdict was read. He hugged his lawyer afterward and said: 'It's OK.'

He
faces 15 years to life for first-degree murder when he is sentenced on 
January 7. He also was found guilty of obstruction of justice, which 
could 
add one to 15 years. MacNeill was led by deputies back to Utah County 
jail.

Randy Spencer, one of his lawyers, said he was disappointed, before declining further comment.

The
chief prosecutor, Chad Grunander, said the largely circumstantial case 
was the most difficult he ever brought to trial and that many 
prosecutors wouldn't bother trying, especially with medical examiners 
unable to produce a finding of homicide.

'It 
was an almost perfect murder,' Mr Grunander said in his closing argument, 
asserting that MacNeill 'pumped her full of drugs' that he knew would be 
difficult to detect once she was dead.

Feeling the pressure: Martin MacNeill, who is accused of killing his wife, heard the closing arguments in his first-degree murder trial on Friday. If convicted, he faces life in prison

An early mistress of MacNeill's testified he once confided he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural.

After
deliberating for 11 hours, the jury issued its guilty verdict to murder
and obstruction of justice shortly after 1am on Saturday.

The
case shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, 35 miles south of 
Salt Lake City, and captured national attention because the defendant 
was a wealthy doctor and a lawyer.

The father-of-eight had a 
picture-perfect family and was a former bishop in his local congregation of 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Defense
lawyers contended that Michele MacNeill died of natural causes. They believed 
she had a heart attack and fell headfirst into the tub. They noted that the post-mortem examination showed she had an enlarged heart, a narrowing of the arteries, and liver and kidney deterioration.

'There's
simply no proof' of homicide,' Mr Spencer said. 'The prosecution has 
presented to you their cherry-picked portion of the evidence.'

He
called the testimony of a handful of prison inmates angling for early 
release doubtful. The men who spent time behind bars with the doctor 
testified he had acknowledged killing his wife - or suggested that 
investigators could never prove he did it.

Their
testimony was the only direct evidence of murder, Mr Grunander said. 
MacNeill's lawyers argued he would never admit murder to strangers in 
prison.

Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin 
MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying 
against him. They had an affair for more than a year before
the death

Former lover: Gypsy Willis, who had been having an affair with MacNeill for 15 months when his wife died, looks towards MacNeill from the witness stand during a recess in his trial on Thursday

MacNeill was medical director of the 
Utah State Development Center, a residential center for people with 
cognitive disorders, who moonlighted in other medical jobs, once 
consulting for a laser hair removal clinic. He had a law degree but 
wasn't known to practice law and has since surrendered his law and 
medical licenses.

The highlight of the 
three-week trial was a mistress who MacNeill introduced as a nanny 
within weeks of his wife's death. His older daughters quickly recognized
Gypsy Willis as his secret lover and said her mother had been arguing 
with her husband over the affair.

Mr Grunander told the Salt Lake Tribune one of the most damning pieces of evidence had been a government identification application MacNeill filled out for Ms Willis who had stated she was his wife, Jillian MacNeill.

On the section of the form asking for their wedding date, MacNeill had written April 14, 2007 - the date of his wife's funeral.

His daughters went to work uncovering what they call their father's secret 
life. They abandoned him while dogging authorities to open a murder 
investigation.

It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a 
federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved 
to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice.

Ms Willis
also served a federal sentence for using the identity of one of 
MacNeill's adopted daughters to escape a debt-heavy history. That 
daughter had been sent back to Ukraine, supposedly only for a summer.

For
a time, MacNeill's only family defender was his only son. Damian, a 
24-year-old law student, committed suicide in January 2010, according to
his sisters, who have said he was haunted by their mother's death.

Loss: Michele MacNeill, right, was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007. Prosecutors claim that her husband, left, left her there to die after giving her a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs

Prosecutors
said MacNeill might have got away with a perfect murder, but his 
erratic behavior the day of his wife's death and shortly afterward was 'dripping with motive'.

They reminded jurors 
about testimony that MacNeill stood in the bathroom yelling what 
prosecutors called phony grief, 'Why did you do this? All because of a 
stupid surgery,' as paramedics tried to revive his wife.

Family
testimony suggested it was MacNeill who insisted his 50-year-old wife, a
former beauty queen in her California hometown, get the surgery. 
Prosecutors said he used it as an excuse to mix painkillers, Valium and 
sleeping pills for her supposed recovery.

'Make no mistake, the defendant's fingerprints, if you will, are all over Michele's death,' Mr Grunander said.

Prosecutors
said MacNeill contrived a medical condition in the weeks leading up to 
his wife's death, telling many around him he was dying of cancer or 
multiple sclerosis to absolve him of any motive in the death. He also 
made use of a cane and could be seen limping at times.

Investigators
who subpoenaed MacNeill's medical records found he was in good 
health. And they discovered something else: MacNeill had been collecting
veteran benefits for decades, saying in an application he had bipolar 
or anti-social disorders.

MacNeill's arrest 
warrant contains a former girlfriend's explosive allegation - not used 
at the trial - that MacNeill killed a brother and tried to kill his 
mother long ago.

Utah investigators confirmed 
the brother, Rufus Roy MacNeill, was found dead in a bathtub in New 
Jersey. They determined MacNeill was never charged and found no 
indication he was ever under investigation for it.
