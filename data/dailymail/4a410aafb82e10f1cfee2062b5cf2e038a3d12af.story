Adam Lallana: £30million. This is the fee being demanded for a 26-year-old who was playing in League One just three years ago.

Southampton are playing hardball in Liverpool’s pursuit of their star player, but is he really worth that much money?

Andrei Shevchenko went to Chelsea from AC Milan for £30m. Ronaldo, the original one, went to Real Madrid from Inter for £30m. Rio Ferdinand went from Leeds to Manchester United for £30m.

Strength to strength: Liverpool are tracking Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana, but may have to pay £30m

£30m men: Manchester United and Chelsea respectively spent big on Rio Ferdinand and Andrei Shevchenko

At the time – the fees of course being relative to the economic climate when the transfers were made – these players were at the pinnacle of their respective positions.

Does Lallana deserve to follow at such a high price?

Well, yes, actually.

I was handed the assignment of following Southampton when they won promotion to the Barclays Premier League back in 2012 and have bore witness to a player who has gasped the opportunity presented to him in the top flight and torn it to shreds.

The truly remarkable thing is how the club managed to keep hold of him all this time.

I once covered a Southampton game when they visited Dagenham and Redbridge in January 2011, on their way to winning promotion from League One.

A certain Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 17 at the time, was almost on his way to Arsenal and would join them that summer, but Lallana was also lighting up the league. He scored that game.

Pitch-side after the match, I asked then-manager Nigel Adkins if he was confident he could realistically keep hold of Lallana as well.

He looked at me like it was the most ridiculous suggestion he had heard all season and insisted his star central midfielder was going nowhere.

I didn’t believe him at the time, but somehow, for so long, they managed to keep Lallana on the south coast.

The player has undoubted technical ability which only the top percentile of professional footballers possess, but what Lallana has developed over years of encouragement at Southampton is a positivity in his play to run opposition players ragged.

He is strongest through the middle, but roams freely on either flank, and plays with utter selflessness.Take his assist for Rickie Lambert against Tottenham at St Mary’s last December as an example.

Lallana had broken free on the right inside the box and had just the on-rushing Hugo Lloris to beat.With a seemingly supernatural sensory perception he took one touch before cutting the ball back behind him to Lambert, leaving the goalkeeper stranded, for a tap-in.

He did it without even looking, so aware of his surroundings that he knew Lambert was running in behind.

Redefining: Lallana has reinvented the legendary Cruyff turn, the brainchild of Holland great Johan

Many players would claim to be able to play with equal strength on either foot, but very few actually can. Lallana is one who actually can.

He scores with his left foot, his right foot, from inside the area, outside the area, with neat finishes from tight angles to pile drivers from distance.

Lallana has reinvented the Cruyff Turn. It is a skill which has become so common it is used ineffectively by any average Joe in Sunday League games up and down the country every weekend.

But Lallana does a proper Cruyff Turn. One which leaves one or two defenders for dead, thus providing Southampton with an extra man going on the attack. And he does this several times a game.

It isn’t flash, it’s not showing off, it is expertly unlocking opposition sides.

His ability to dribble past opposition players, to swerve and shimmy and shift the ball from right to left like it is magnetised to his feet is mesmeric.

The goal he scored against Hull last November, when he slalomed past four players, carrying the ball into the box on the left before accurately finding the far right corner from the tightest angle, was one of the goals last season.

Liverpool will only hope they can get the negotiations finished before the World Cup starts, when Lallana will have the opportunity to showcase his talents on the biggest stage of all.

He is more than ready for the step up.
