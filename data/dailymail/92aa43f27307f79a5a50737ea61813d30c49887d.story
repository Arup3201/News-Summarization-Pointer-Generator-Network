It can send any sports player running for the water bottle, but for one college soccer star, sweating can also send her to the emergency room.

Caitlin McComish, 20, from White House, Ohio, suffers from a severe form of a common condition called cholinergic urticarial - a hives disorder when her skin is exposed to heat and sweat.

It means that running on the soccer field gives her body an intense inflammatory reaction, which causes her to develop hives and her throat to swell, leaving her in need of immediate medical care.

The University of Toledo student first suffered a life-threatening anaphylactic shock from the allergy while on a run in her hometown in 2013.

'I had a really upset stomach, tingly palms and the bottoms of my feet,' she recounted to ABC News.

'I was really, really itchy. It hit me like uncomfortable heat waves. Then I could feel the swelling in my throat, and my tongue got tingly and thicker.'

She called her mother, who arrived with an ambulance as her throat was closing.

She underwent treatment but by the time she returned to school that fall, she had suffered a staggering 17 shocks - always when she was training.

The avid soccer player tried numerous different strategies to reduce her body's response to sweat, including wearing a cooling vest and taking ice baths before practice - but nothing worked.

Eventually, she saw Dr. David Lang, chairman of the department of allergy and clinical immunology at The Cleveland Clinic, who advised McComish to receive Xolair injections, an asthma drug.

'Somehow I got to see Dr. Lang, I think out of the grace of God,' McComish said.

McComish has noticed a 'dramatic response' and could head back to the soccer field - although an unrelated heart condition has since benched her again.

Cholinergic urticarial is actually very common - a survey of 500 high school students showed that 10 per cent had some form.

'It's a 
condition where people have itching and swelling and the major issue is 
heat or sweat as a provoking factor,' Dr Lang said.

'It's
 quite common in the general population, but in most cases, it's mild 
and patients either aren't aware of it or manage their symptoms well.'

For McComish, seeking help and getting to the bottom of her allergy has allowed her to reassess.

'I had a come-to-Jesus moment with myself,' she said. 'I wasn't really worried about my health and I wanted to play soccer. I thought if I pushed it under the rug and kept working hard, it would go away.

'The harder I worked, the worse I got, until my favorite coach said, "There is a difference between working hard and working smart." And I kind of had to realize that and simplify my life.'
