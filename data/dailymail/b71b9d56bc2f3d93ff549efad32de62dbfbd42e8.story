Manchester United are hoping for a breakthrough in discussions over the £35million transfer of Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal.

The Chile international shares the same agent as Alexis Sanchez, Fernando Felicevich, and talks are understood to have taken place on Friday.

Sanchez signed for Arsenal on Thursday in a £30m move and United hope his international team-mate Vidal could follow him to the Premier League.

Negotiating process: Vidal's agent is understood to have held talks with United on Friday

Vidal joined Juventus in 2011 from Bayer Leverkusen and has seen his stock rise after playing a central role in the club's three consecutive Serie A titles, making a name for himself as a player who is equally comfortable tackling tough or scoring and assisting goals.

The 27-year-old travelled to the 2014 World Cup with Chile despite having surgery on a knee injury in early May and helped his country reach the second round before they were defeated by Brazil on penalties.

Vidal signed a contract extension with Juventus in December last year tying him to the club until 2017.

United also have interest in Real Madrid's Angel di Maria but face competition from Paris Saint-Germain.

The Argentina international was injured during the 2014 World Cup quarter-final win against Belgium but made a return to light training on Thursday and could yet feature in the final on Sunday.

The winger has been linked with a move to Monaco in the past but stayed at the Bernabeu to help them win the Champions League at the personal request of former United favourite Cristiano Ronaldo.
