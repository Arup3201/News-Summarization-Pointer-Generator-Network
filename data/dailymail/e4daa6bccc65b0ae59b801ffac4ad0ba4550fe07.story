Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today compared Iraq's war-ravaged Kurdish breakaway region fighting ISIS – to Scotland.

Mr Hammond, speaking in Baghdad after meeting the country's new Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, said he hoped Scotland's decision to reject independence would inspire Iraq to stay united.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Mr Hammond said: 'I hope that the experience of Scotland will be a useful model for Iraq.'

His remarks come after Mr Hammond wrongly claimed that Britain was not considering airstrikes on Syria – a claim swiftly rejected by Downing Street. Mr Hammond was later forced to apologise and clarify his remarks.

Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan has vowed to hold a referendum on independence

Kurdish independence has soared in popularity with the Iraqi state on the brink of collapse following the dramatic gains by ISIS fanatics since June,

The breakaway region is being armed by Britain and other Western powers to hold back the fanatics' sweeping advance in northern Iraq.

But Mr Hammond said the Kurds should stay in Iraq – suggesting that, like Scotland, they are 'stronger' in a united Iraq.

Scotland voted to reject independence last month by 55 to 45 per cent, despite a last-minute panic following polls which showed the race tipping in favour of the nationalists.

Speaking in Baghdad today, Mr Hammond said: 'The Scottish people looked long and hard at the question of separation and they decided they were better off in the United Kingdom, stronger and safer in the United Kingdom.'

Mr Hammond also met Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, who took office last month at the head of a new administration intended to be more inclusive of the country's ethnic and religious groups.

Amid growing concern that Iraqi forces are unable to turn the tide on jihadist expansion despite foreign air strikes, Mr Hammond reiterated Britain's support, but ruled out a ground intervention.

'To beat ISIL, it is the Iraqi people, the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi government that will have to take the lead on the ground,' he said.

Mr Hammond said allied air strikes against Islamic State militants had halted the jihadists' advance in Iraq and degraded their military capabilities.

In a show of support for Mr Abadi's government, Mr Hammond said the UK was determined to 'play its part' in helping Iraqis combat the IS fighters - also referred to as Isis or Isil (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant).

Addressing reporters following the talks, the Foreign Secretary said: 'We've always understood that the air campaign alone was not going to be decisive in turning the tide against Isil.

'But it has halted the Isil advance, it has forced Isil to change its tactics and it is degrading their military capabilities.'

Confirming the UK Government's position that there will be no British 'boots on the ground' in Iraq, Mr Hammond added: 'The heavy work on the ground is going to have to be done by Iraqi forces.'

His visit came amid fears that the key Sunni province of Anbar in western Iraq could be about to fall to IS. The province's police chief was killed on Sunday when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb close to the capital, Ramadi.

Following last month's emergency Commons vote, RAF Tornado GR4 fighter bombers have been attacking IS targets in Iraq in support of the US-led coalition being assembled to counter the jihadi threat.

It was disclosed over the weekend that a small team of Army instructors from the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment is in the Kurdish capital, Irbil, helping to train the Kurdish peshmerga fighters to use heavy machine guns which the UK has supplied to them.
