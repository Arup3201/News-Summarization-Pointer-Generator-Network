TalkTalk has finally shaken its title as the most complained-about broadband provider, having been replaced by Orange, according to the latest Ofcom figures.

Complaints about Orange’s service spiked in September, apparently related to it withdrawing its free broadband offer unless customers bought line rental from the company.

TalkTalk was the second most complained-about broadband provider, with BT also generating above-average complaints, the regulator’s figures for July to September show.

Ofcom revealed that over 300 people a day are complaining about their broadband service - with Orange now the most complained- about service provider

Sky’s broadband service attracted the fewest complaints.

An Ofcom spokesman said : 'Overall, 
complaints levels are much lower for pay-TV and ‘pay-as-you-go’ mobile 
telephone services than for broadband services, landline telephone and 
‘pay monthly’ mobile telephone services.'

TalkTalk spokesman Charles Whitney claimed the firm had made 'significant improvements' during the year.

He said: 'Complaints about landline 
services are 50 per cent down year-on-year with broadband complaints 
down 36 per cent in that period.

'We have invested in our online 
customer support - which now accounts for over 70 per cent of customer 
contacts , and offer more support when people move home. 

'When issues do arise, we increasingly 
fix them first time.

'We will continue to look for ways to better serve 
our customers while continuing to provide the great value we are known 
for.'

Ofcom said it received an average of 300 complaints a day about the range of communications providers, after customers had been unable to resolve their problems in the first instance with the company concerned.

The seventh quarterly report, which aims to help consumers decide which service or provider to choose and incentivise suppliers, found TalkTalk generated the most complaints among landline providers, with complaints about BT also above the industry average.

Virgin Media and Sky jointly achieved the fewest number of complaints among landline providers.Among pay TV providers, Ofcom received the most complaints about BT Vision - which remained six times greater than the industry average.

Virgin Media also attracted above-average complaints, while Sky had the lowest number of complaints.
