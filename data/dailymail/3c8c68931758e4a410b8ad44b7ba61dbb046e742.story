Images showing an ISIS magazine being circulated in Indonesia have emerged, with reports that the magazines and accompanying brochures are being handed out at mosques in the province of Java.

The third edition of Malay language publication Al Mustaqbal was released last month by the jihadist group, and is based on the theme of 'Islamic State Undercover', according to the magazine's website.

The site, when translated to English, says the latest edition - which features a man waving the ISIS flag high above his head on the cover - 'explores history, development, creed and manhaj (the Islamic methodology by which truth is reached).

It also says the magazine is recommended for 'those who really want to know about ISIS', pledges to 'answer the myriad of questions and the rumours' circulating about the group, and talks about ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

However the inside pages of the magazine are much more grim, and feature spreads of photographs of ISIS militants in battle, fighters taking out executions and rows of what look to be the dead bodies of children.

Pictures of world leaders such as former President of the United States George Bush and former Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr also appear.

Many images of soldiers armed with heavy weaponry are also printed in the magazine, along with numerous photos showing dozens of ISIS members waving the black and white flag they are often seen with.

According to the Jakarta Globe, the Central Java Government recently discovered a chapter of ISIS which had been active in Malang, in the East Java Province of Indonesia, for over a month.

They have reportedly been using a village mosque in Sempu as their headquarters, and are calling themselves Ansharul Khilafah.

The Al Mustaqbal magazine's website says the publication is for those who want answers to the 'myriad of questions and the rumours' circulating about ISIS

A man from Malang told Jakarta Globe he was alerted to a meeting held by the group where the magazines were being distributed via social media.

'I was tagged about the establishment [of Ansharullah Khilafah] on Facebook, so my friends and I went [to the mosque]. There was a video screening and a sermon about ISIS.

'They handed out Al Mustaqbal magazines, brochures and vouchers for fried chicken,' Aji Prase told the Jakarta Globe.

This comes as Abu Bakar Bashir, who is currently imprisoned in Indonesia and has links to terrorist groups Al Qaeda, has apparently pledged his allegiance to ISIS.

Parallels between the publication and Inspire magazine which is circulated by al-Qaeda can be drawn

Late last month the latest edition of ISIS's English language propoganda magazine Dabiq was released, and according to Business Insider Indonesia was full of self justification of the extreme ideology the group follows.

It reportedly compares itself to a version of the story of Noah's Arc and the flood, and says in the way in which people had no choice but to believe in God to survive, people should turn to ISIS if they wish to survive.

These publications all draw similarities with Inspire, the English-language online publication of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

All use the power of the online world and social media to connect with their audiences and drum up support within their followers.
