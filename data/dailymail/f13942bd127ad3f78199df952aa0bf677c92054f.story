A rare prototype of the first American penny was sold for $1.175million at an auction in Baltimore, Maryland.

The pricey penny, which dates from 1792, is one of only seven Birch Pennies which are known to exist. 

The deal went down late Thursday and it was one of the highlights of a two-day sale of rare US coins, medals and paper money.

The 1792 Birch Cent - one of only seven known to exist - sold for $1.175million at an auction in Baltimore

The deal closed Thursday during the Whitman Coin & Collectibles Expo at the Baltimore Convention Center

Stack's Bowers Galleries of Irvine, California, organized the auction during the Whitman Coin & Collectibles Expo at the Baltimore Convention Center. 

The $1.175 million price tag included the buyer's premium.

The auction catalog read: 'The Birch cent is, simply, the first of a cultural phenomenon that is known the world over - it is the first American cent.' 

Vicken Yegparian of Stack's Bowers said he was happy with the sale price, the Baltimore Sun reported. 

Yegparian said: 'It's not every day you sell a million-dollar rarity. 

'The primary motivation is a love of history, a love of the beauty and the lore of the coin.

'In the top-tier pieces, some of it is just bragging rights: '"I have something you don't."'

The buyer was not identified, but the coin - which was engraved the year Congress created the US Mint, and nine years after the American Revolutionary War - was the second Birch Penny to be sold this year.

The man who ended up with the coin said he was from Texas.

The first was snapped up by a Beverly Hills rare coin dealer in January for $2.585million at an auction in Florida. 

Kevin Lipton, 55, had the winning bid for that penny.

He said: 'It's like our very first penny.

'It's such a spectacular coin. It's so important, so rare. 

'They are literally Mona Lisas of our coinage.'

The coin Lipton bought was previously sold in 1981 for $200,000.

Named for engraver Robert Birch, the penny sold on Thursday depicts Lady Liberty encircled by the words 'Liberty parent of science and industry.'

The flip side is engraved with 'United States of America,' 'One cent,' and the fraction 1/100.
