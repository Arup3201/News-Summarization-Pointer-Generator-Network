A great-grandfather was left for dead by an ‘evil’ young mother and her partner who attacked him in his own home.

Arnold Hilton, 88, had his life ‘destroyed’ when Aurelisa Galdikaite and Laurynas Dauksas broke in and inflicted ‘severe violence’ on him.

Mother-of-one Galdikaite, 23, ransacked ‘every drawer, in every room’ of the house while Dauksas repeatedly punched and kicked Mr Hilton. The Lithuanian couple then left their victim lying on his bedroom floor, covered in blood.

Galdikaite was jailed for nine years for the despicable crime, while Dauksas, 25, got 11 years.

The morning after the attack, Mr Hilton’s son Stuart found him bleeding on the floor with his belongings scattered around him. When he saw his son Mr Hilton said: ‘I’m not going to make it.’

The father-of-five, now 89, spent two weeks in hospital before he was well enough to be moved to a care home, but remains so traumatised that he barricades his bedroom door shut at night.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Galdikaite and Dauksas  inflicted ‘severe violence’ on Mr Hilton after they broke into his home in Upholland, Lancashire, on the night of March 20.

As Galdikaite raided the house, Dauksas, on licence after being released from prison for a motoring offence, repeatedly punched and kicked the former Bevin Boy – one of the thousands conscripted into the coal mines during the Second World War.

Jailing the pair, Judge David Aubrey, QC, said: ‘This was an evil, despicable offence on a man who was in the autumn of his life and prior to this sustained attack had enjoyed pottering and socialising with his friends.

‘You have, in effect, destroyed his life. He now remains confused, upset and distressed and his health has deteriorated.’

Paul Becker, prosecuting, had earlier told the court Mr Hilton was struck several times by Dauksas. He said: ‘There were nine areas where the bruising indicated direct force by punching and kicking. These included head, chest and shoulders.’

In police interviews, Galdikaite and Dauksas claimed they had been drinking and were looking for her missing dog when they stumbled across Mr Hilton’s home.

Police said they stole a cheque book and a Gurkha knife after attacking Mr Hilton. The cheque book was recovered but the knife has never been found.

The defendants were arrested within 48 hours of the attack after Galdikaite’s fingerprints were found on a biscuit tin in Mr Hilton’s home. They both pleaded guilty to one count of robbery. Both defendants, of Wigan, face automatic deportation on their release.

Detective Inspector Marc Nasser said: ‘Stuart Hilton called in to see his father as a matter of routine en-route to work and finding his father in that state must have been devastating.’

He added: ‘The level of violence used was beyond comprehension. Sadly as a result of this Arnold lives in a care home and will never be able to return home. He has lost much of his independence and confidence.’

So active: Mr Hilton's son Stuart described the 89-year-old as an active man who was well known in his local community before the attack

Distraught family members said the former glazing firm managing director has become a ‘shadow of his former self’.

Mr Hilton, 43, said his father was a keen golfer who has ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild, adding: ‘It is heart-breaking to see him like this.

‘He was a man in the last years of his life and they should have been peaceful but he has been destroyed. He is terrified of being attacked again and sometimes even puts a chair in front of his door because he thinks they are going to come back.

‘He was a well-known local character and loved to socialise with his friends. He was so active and fit and loved his sport, he played golf for years and enjoyed watching football and rugby. He’s gone from going out three or four times a week to living in a care home and having 24-hour care.
