Read how Matt Lawton's exclusively revealed West Ham's move for Teddy Sheringham

Teddy Sheringham has returned to West Ham as the club’s new attacking coach.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed the Hammers’ move for the ex-England international last week.

Manager Sam Allardyce has been told to implement a more attacking approach by the club’s hierarchy, with the introduction of new forwards coach part of those plans.

Hammer time: teddy Sheringham is set to rejoin West Ham, the club he played for between 2004 and 2007, as Sam Allardyce's new attacking coach

East End hero: Sheringham was part of Alan Pardew's team who celebrated promotion to the Premier League in 2005 after winning the Championship play-off final

Sheringham said: ‘It was far too good to turn down.

‘Being
 a West Ham boy and coming from the area, it fits nicely in all that I’m
 about, what with working alongside Sam and knowing a few of the players
 as well.

‘I know the environment, I know everything about West Ham. The players have got a lot of respect for Sam.

‘They speak very highly of him and to know that’s the case made me want to get involved.

Allardyce
 added: ‘Teddy was interested in coming into coaching at this stage so 
we’re obviously glad to have him on board to give us a new outlook on 
how we are working with our attacking players.

‘We hope he can give 
some individual expertise and one-on-one coaching with our attacking 
lads to hopefully help us to score a few more goals.

‘Everybody knows
 how long he played, into his forties, and he spent the latter part of 
his career at West Ham so he knows all about the club and we’re all 
looking forward to him joining us and being part of our very highly 
qualified staff.’

'Teddy
 is somebody who I knew as a very young apprentice at Millwall when I 
was playing there, so obviously from those days it was interesting to 
see how he developed into an outstanding individual in terms of what he 
achieved as a footballer.'

Sheringham scored nearly 361 goals in 959 games for club and 
country during a glittering 24-year playing career and played a key role
 in helping Manchester United winning the Premier League, Champions 
League and FA Cup - scoring in both finals.

Under orders: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has been instructed by the club's board to improve the attacking flair of the team that finished last season in 13th place

Leading the line: Should Sheringham take the role, he'll be working with England forward Andy Carroll (pictured alongside Mark Noble) at Upton Park

Allardyce added: 'I
 rang Teddy up to see if he was interested and he jumped at the chance. 
Obviously, he will come in and work specifically with the attacking 
players, so it's a part-time role to start with and we'll how it goes 
and develops after that.

'He
 brings many things - his experience and knowledge as a player, his 
technical ability and then the sort of things he might have done in the 
box to make that little bit more space.

Starting out: Sheringham began his career at Millwall in the 1980s

Big goal: Sheringham celebrates after equalising against Bayern Munich in the Champions League Final in 1999

'It's
 breaking it down into a very specific basis so the players can take it 
on board, learn from it and hopefully adapt it on the field to use those
 techniques to make space and put the ball in the back of the net.'
