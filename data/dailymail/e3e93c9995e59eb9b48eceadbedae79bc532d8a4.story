A former CEO at the BBC has been accused of saying women with children should not hold senior management positions because they are not 'focused'.

Mark Thomas, who had £200,000 a year role, allegedly began bullying a male employee who 'stood up to him' over the alleged sexual discrimination.

Byron Myers, who worked for Mr Thomas as an HR manager, is claiming he was bullied by him to a point where he had to quit his £77,000 a year job, a tribunal in Watford, Hertfordshire, said.

Mr Myers claims the reason why Mr Thomas, who was the Chief Executive Officer of BBC Studios and Post Production, turned against him in 2011, because he dared to speak up about what happened when a woman manager with young children wanted to work part time.

Mr Myers, 39, said that during negotiations with Katy Child, Mr Thomas told him women with 'child caring responsibilities' should not hold senior management positions because they were not 'focused.'

He claims the then CEO came up with the idea of offering her a job share with conditions of acceptance so 'onerous' that she would have to refuse the offer.

Mr Myers says the woman was unhappy when offered a job sharing role that required her to work around 10 weeks of the year full time and was 'unworkable.'

He alleges that at one point during his discussions with Mr Thomas about the situation, his boss told him: 'That b**** has had every guy in here wrapped around her fingers.'

The tribunal has heard from Mr Myers that he eventually turned 'whistle blower' and claimed he found himself being bullied and belittled by his boss in the months that followed.

Mr Myers, from London, is claiming unfair dismissal, constructive dismissal and breach of contract.

Giving evidence today Mr Thomas, who himself left the BBC in 2012, said he was appointed as CEO of the department in 2008.

Mr Thomas said he was in talks with the unions over planned department moves to Salford, redundancies and pension changes

He said he was involved in talks with the unions over planned department moves to Salford, redundancies and pension changes.

In January of 2011 he said he had a meeting with Ms Child, who was Head of Commercial Development.

He said the mother of two young children wanted to discuss her future and he said: 'I was very clear with her that I wanted to retain her talents within S&PP, that I rated her and it would be a good outcome to keep her in a different role.'

He said it was his suggestion that she consider the job of Operations Manager working in Digital Media Services.

Mr Thomas said she was already working part time and the new job had been conceived as a full time post.

However, he said she told him it was possible her husband could also be made redundant and, if that happened, she might consider doing the job on a full time basis.

He said he advised her to speak to the head of Digital Media Services, Clive Hodge as well as Mr Myers about the 'likely redundancy situation,' so she had all the facts.

He said: 'I do not discriminate against female employees or hold the view or perception that women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions as they are less focused on the job.

'A number of employees worked flexibly during my time as CEO to accommodate childcare responsibilities, including three women who have management positions.'

He said he was 'disappointed' that little progress seemed to be made in the negotiations with Ms Child in the weeks that followed and that Mr Myers had had little dealings with her.

Eventually, he said he learned she had come back with a proposal for the job to be shared and that she had identified a potential job sharer.

However, he told the tribunal, he did have concerns about the plan that Mr Myers and Mr Hodge had come up with for flexible working, especially since all three people involved in the job share had young children.

He said he had real concerns about the 'continuity of leadership' being maintained at all times and pointed this out to Mr Myers and Mr Hodge.'

'My concern was that no consideration had been given to how the job sharers would cover each other's leave.'

'I didn't think the proposed job share currently met the business needs and asked Mr Myers to revisit these issues with Mr Hodge and Katy to find a way through.'

He added: 'My approach as CEO was to minimise the risk to the business.'

He denied every saying Ms Child was a 'bitch' who wrapped men in the office around her finger.

He denied saying the remark about women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions because they were not focused.

He told the hearing 'I do not believe I treated Mr Myers in a detrimental way at any time. I did not bully or undermine him or isolate him in decision making.'

He added: 'I would need to chase him for information or to deliver on an action I has assigned.

'I would find myself having to ask questions about situations I would have expected Mr Myers to have already asked.

'I often provided feedback on Mr Myers' inter-personal skills, in particular his team working skills and how he interacted with colleagues.'

He said he found that Mr Myers could be rude to his colleagues and he would comment on it.

'I had noticed that when provided with feedback he didn't like it, he had a tendency to over react, dismiss or deflect it by twisting what was being said to him.'

He said at no time during May 2011 had he spread rumours that Mr Myers was on his way out due to making his disclosures.

Mr Thomas said he was 'shocked' at the way Mr Myers had 'twisted events.'

The tribunal continues.
