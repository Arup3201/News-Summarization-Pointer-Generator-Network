Two Australian 'crusaders without clothes' have stripped off beside some of London's most iconic landmarks in a project to promote nudity.

Sam Hatfield and Fiona Skelton bared all at Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.

They also offered their own interpretation of the iconic image of The Beatles by strolling across the Abbey Road crossing.

The stunts are part of their 'Nakedme' internet project - a 'worldwide crusade' to 'make nudity more acceptable'.

The London images were part of a short film they made for the project called 'Bare Rollin' in the Big Smoke'.

The duo, who call themselves 'the crusaders without clothes', said: 'We are here to make being comfortable with nudity cool.

'Being shameless about displays of nudity is our way of subtly challenging the shame complex that causes so many people to be embarrassed about themselves and fearful of other's nudity.'

The Australians posed naked outside a number of iconic landmarks including Buckingham Palace 

It is not the first time the two Australians have stripped-off in public.They rode a scooter across the Sydney Harbour Bridge wearing nothing but helmets, boots and gloves

They also danced naked with commuters on the suspended railway in the picturesque German town of Wuppertal.

In a statement on their website they 
added: 'By a twist of fate it has become incumbent upon us to lead this 
final battle for carnal freedom.

'Where others fail we will prevail, 
through audacity and wild abandon, for we are the successors of the 
revolution to storm this last bastion of Victorian cultural taboos.

'We shall ride the winds of change, while simultaneously feeling the wind on our nether regions.

'Because there’s one thing they didn’t count on: they can’t beat our shamelessness with shame. This is the Nakedme Show, and we are the crusaders without clothes.'
