Welcome to the Cool Grandmother Club! Believe me, it’s the place to be — not the slightest bit exclusive, but with terrific benefits.

From now on, I guarantee, you’ll have a fresh take on life and love.

Nowadays, grandmotherhood doesn’t conjure up pictures of white-haired old  ladies in rocking chairs. You and I are more likely to be in jeans and funky boots.

But still, this is a brand new phase of life. Suddenly, middle age becomes magnificent. Becoming a grandparent is an astonishing transformation, no matter who you are.

It happened to me last year when my grandson was born in June and my granddaughter in September.

Yes, two came along and I’m amazed by the way the small people have changed my life.

I’m not just referring to the inevitable demands on time and attention, but a jolt into a different way of being. You’ll find out now.

Already you’ve made a brilliant start. Most grandmothers rush eagerly to the hospital as soon as they can, but you wisely held back on the first day, knowing just how much William and Catherine wanted that quiet, private time with their new son.

When you walked into the Lindo Wing at last, you saw the eyes (and lenses) of the world focused on seeing the royal baby — who is also, first and foremost, your grandson.

It must have been daunting as well as exciting to realise how important your role will be in helping to shape his young life.

I remember my mother telling me that when you have your own child, you’re young, busy and stressed, but when grandchildren arrive, you have changed. You’re calmer, wiser and ready to give that precious commodity: time.

More than that, grandmotherhood can involve a subtle shift in your personality. Obviously, this doesn’t work for all women. But it has for me.

Nature has designed older females for a vital role within the family. Our child-bearing years are over and we possess the confidence of middle age, knowing who and what we are, with nothing to prove.

Now is the perfect moment to assume the all-important mantle of The Grandmother.

Mind you, the transformation is gradual. Of course, I made all the obvious noises of delight when the babies were born and naturally felt proud and excited. But you don’t necessarily fall in love with your grandchildren overnight.

Initially, your thoughts will be with your daughter — your own baby — wanting her to be happy, to cope, to grow into the role of parent and perform it brilliantly.

Then you look at the little bundle in your arms and realise this strange new creature is about to make demands on you — and for years.

That can make you anxious.

I found myself wondering if I could be as competent, energetic and self-sacrificing as my parents were when I had my children, Dan and Kitty.

What if I didn’t want to sit on the floor with a baby and a pile of plastic bricks? Would I (yuk!) get used to stinky nappies all over again? I hoped I’d grow into the role, but felt nervous. Maybe you feel that way, too.

The first lesson I learned was to keep quiet. Having brought up our own children, you and I think we know what we’re doing. But woe betide you if a view escapes your lips unasked for! Believe me, your daughter (yes, even serene Kate) will soon put you in your place.

The first time I took care of my granddaughter for the evening, I fed her and changed her nappy, then put her back in the wrong place in the crib. Imagine! I had to bite my tongue when Kitty demanded to know why. Remember, new mums are anxious.

If the first rule of grandmotherhood is not to say ‘I did it this way’ or ask ‘Why do you need to do that?’, the second rule is not to bridle.

Don’t endlessly bleat over the baby and blurt out opinions. This is their gig, not ours! That’s what I mean by a subtle shift in your personality. Even a control freak like me (and, I suspect, you) has to learn to step back.

When Catherine wants advice, she might ask for it, but sometimes you’ll feel irritated because she doesn’t realise she jolly well needs it.

Even if you murmur something loving, such as ‘Sweetie, don’t worry quite so much — it’ll be fine’, you’ll be wounded if she bites your head off. So step back and save yourself a stab of pain.

And when you make mistakes, just shrug and be relaxed. The new parents make the rules about food and bedtime, and we have to obey them.

With all the pressure on Catherine, it would be astonishing if in private she remains as unflappable as she seems in public. So it’s all the more important for you, as her mother, to be calm and quiet.Minimum instruction, but maximum reassurance.

Our daughters need strong support and don’t want us to neglect them in favour of the baby. It seems to me essential to remember that you are Mum first and Grandmother second. 

That’s why it’s important to tell your daughter how well she is doing as she gradually learns to play the most important role in the world: being a mother. Praise her. She’ll need it. But above all — enjoy!

As I write this, ten-month-old Chloe is on my knee because her mum, my daughter, is at an evening course and her husband is helping to bring in hay bales from our field.

To type this, I’m trying to reach around baby, who keeps banging the keyboard, so I have to delete her contributions. It’s hilarious.

Once, I’d have been frustrated by such a scene and want someone — anyone — to take the baby. Now, though, it makes me laugh.

I can’t tell you the delight of realising you want to work less and play more.

That’s the glorious thing about the Cool Grandmother Club — it’s a passport to optimism and fun.I’ve even learned to love that irritating pad of middle-aged spread on my hips, because I see what it’s for: a perfect seat for a baby.

There’s a new sense of usefulness and of youth, too.

In a moment, I will change Chloe’s nappy, give her a bottle and put her to bed — and I can’t wait for a goodnight cuddle.

The smell of my grandchildren’s heads takes me back to being a young mother . . . and so life moves in a wonderful arc. I feel completed — and I hope you do, too.

What else is there to say? Just this: that no matter his status from birth, the relentless public scrutiny or what the future holds, when snuggled in your arms he is just a lovely baby and you are just a normal, proud grandmother.

Build a fortress around that private love, Carole. He will need it.
