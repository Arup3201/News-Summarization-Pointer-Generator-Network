Relatives of a recently deceased 66-year-old woman have discovered the skeletal remains of two infants in a footlocker while cleaning out her mobile home in northeast Ohio, police have confirmed.

A man contacted investigators after he and a cousin found the remains on Monday in the locked container while cleaning out his mother's mobile home in North Canton, about 45 miles southeast of Cleveland.

Among the remains were a partial skull that witnesses say 'could fit in the palm of your hand'.

The woman died in on November 28, police said.

The remains of two infants, including a partial skull 'that could fit in the palm of your hand', have been found inside this trunk. The discovery was made by the son of a recently-deceased 66-year-old who was cleaning out his mother's mobile home in North Canton, Ohio

It's not clear how old the remains are, but it doesn't appear the children died recently, North Canton police Chief Stephan Wilder said.

Maitenance man Doug Lindower, who was working in the park on N. Main St at the time of the discovery, said he was there when the woman's son opened the blue trunk.

'I just ain't never seen anything like that in my life,' the maintenance worker told Canton Rep.

Lindower said the man was 'distraught' at the finding.

The remains were in a plastic bag that was in the worn, light blue locker with a small blanket and other items, Wilder said.

He said the bag also appeared to contain some sort of cloth that had deteriorated.

'It's a sad case to have to investigate,' Wilder said.

The gruesome discovery was made in this mobile home park on North Canton, Ohio, on Monday. Authorities say it could take several weeks to receive the results of a forensic and DNA analysis of the remains

Investigators searched the home but found nothing else noteworthy.

The Stark County coroner's office confirmed the remains were those of two infants, and the office plans to have them examined by anthropologists at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pa.

That examination and a DNA analysis could help address lingering questions, including the ages and gender of the children, but it's not clear if there is enough evidence to determine what happened to them, Wilder said.

The woman lived in North Canton for the past five years after moving from Louisville, and Wilder said police are not yet sure how long the remains were in the trunk or whether the woman had any knowledge of its contents.

Her son, who lives in California, has cooperated with investigators, the chief said.

'I think he was, you know, alarmed or shocked by what he found in his mother's belongings,' Wilder said.

Police are reaching out to other relatives in hopes of learning more about the remains.
