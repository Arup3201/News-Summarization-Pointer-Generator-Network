Offers for a Detroit fixer-upper reached a record of $135,000 before the intense bidding war caused the auction website to crash last week.

The palatial brick-colonial at 115 Chicago Street is one of hundreds of homes being auctioned off on the Detroit Land Bank's website, in hopes of bringing life back into the bankrupted city's ghost-town neighborhoods.

Interest in the 3,000-square-foot home surpassed the website's capabilities and the 142 frantic bids caused the site to crash at 5:30pm and it wasn't working again until the following morning.

Something to fight for: A bidding war over the above Detroit home caused an auction site to crash last week. Bids had reached a record $135,000 by the time the site went down

My house: Local DJ Carl Hollier (pictured) claims he won the property fair and square after outmatching fellow bidder 'tjeff' by $7,000

Dream home: Hollier posted this screen grab on his Facebook, showing the message he received from the site saying he won the property. He says he and his kids fell in love with the house, which is located just across the street from his aunt and uncle

Alexis Wiley, a spokesman for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, said the crash happened before a winner could be decided, but bidder Carl Hollier says he has proof the house is his.

Hollier, a local DJ, told the Detroit Free Press that he fell in love with the home, which is located right across the street from his aunt and uncle.

He thought it would be a great place to call home and raise his kids.

But on Friday, he had stiff competition from another user online who kept outbidding him by $100.

Hollier decided up the ante and put down $7,000, which he hoped would be too rich for his competitor's blood.

That's when he received a notification saying he won the property, and immediately he was overjoyed.

'I was so happy and excited,' he said. 'I called my parents and then I got a phone call around 6:35pm from the Land Bank saying there had been a problem.'

Despite getting an electronic confirmation of his real estate purchase, the Land Bank said the website crashed before the other user, with the screen named 'tjeff', could submit a bid and he called the city to complain.

'We wanted to make sure this is a fair and transparent process and that everyone has a fair shot,' Wiley said. 'We’ve corrected the error that led to this. We absolutely understand where Mr. Hollier is coming from. ...I’m hoping Mr. Hollier bids again.'

Hollider is
 enraged. He says he doesn't plan to bid again and is considering legal 
action against the bank for not living up to their electronic promise. 

From pictures posted online, it's easy to see why the home would cause such a commotion.

The
 Boston-Edison Historic district home starts off with a bang, as guests 
are greeted with expansive front patio bigger than many apartments.

Once
 inside, the home is filled with original details like a grand 
staircase, wood paneling, several fireplaces and  intricate molding.

Upstairs there's room for a large family with four bedrooms and 2.2 bathrooms.

However,
 the home does need a lot of work including complete replacement of the 
roof, doors and 60 windows. From there, upgrades to to the electrical 
system and plumping are recommended as well as interior waterproofing. 
They boiler system, kitchen, bathrooms and drywall should also be 
replaced.

Back on the market: The home will be auctioned off again on June 6

Mayor Duggan hopes 115 Chicago St and other properties like it will lure more people to the city, and bring life to long-abandoned homes.

The city currently has some 84,000 blighted homes, and plans to auction off 32 salvageable properties every weekend day through June 21.

Interest in the program is high, with 6,000 registered bidders on BuildingDetroit.org, the auction website.

Before last Friday's auction, the highest bid was for $87,100 on a another fixer-upper in the Woodbridge neighborhood. The cheapest home was sold for $5,100 and it was a 3-bedroom, 1.1bath brick colonial on the city's east side.

So far, 22 homes have been sold this way for a total of $720,700. The average price for a home is $34.319.05

Those who win the properties in auction are required to pay 10 per cent within three days, and depending on the price the rest within another 60 to 90 days.

They must produce a construction contract or receipts for rehabilitation materials within 30 days and a proof of occupancy in six months.
