MK Dons have joined the race for former Chelsea midfielder Filipe Morais.

The 29-year-old, who currently plays for Bradford, is attracting interest from a host Championship and League One sides following a string of impressive displays for the Bantams.

Morais signed a short-term deal with Bradford in the summer - but the contract is due to expire next month.

Bradford manager Phil Parkinson is hopeful of keeping Morais, but could face an uphill battle should those higher in the English football pyramid solidify their interest.

Morais has played a key role for the Bantams this season, but the club are yet to strike a deal to keep him.

Morais played in Jose Mourinho’s first-ever match as Chelsea manager in a pre-season friendly against Oxford in 2004.

Phil Parkinson is hopeful of keeping Morais, but could face an uphill battle in January 

He signed his first professional deal in 2005, but never made a senior appearance for the Blues before rejecting another 12 month deal ahead of leaving for Millwall in 2006.

‘It’s incredibly hard, almost impossible, for youngsters to break through at Chelsea,’ he said in 2007.

‘There was the offer of another year, but I knew it was time to move on. I had to get first-team football to improve myself.’
