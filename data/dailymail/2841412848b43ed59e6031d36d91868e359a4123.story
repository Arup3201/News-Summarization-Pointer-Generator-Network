A teenager from Leicester is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the second young British man to be stabbed while on holiday at the same Turkish resort in a fortnight.

Declan McNulty, 18, of Leicester, suffered damage to his liver in the attack in Marmaris, Turkey, which has left him in intensive care in the same hospital as Callum Copson, who suffered a similar attack two weeks ago.

Sports coach Mr McNulty is understood to have been attacked in the resort following an argument in a bar on Monday.

Witness Tanya Robinson said: 'I thought it was just pushing and shoving at first but as one lad ran off I realised that the other one was doubled over clutching his stomach and trying to hold his insides in.

'His friend gave over his T shirt to try and stem the bleeding and stop his intestines slipping out. It was horrific.'

Mr McNulty and his friend are understood to have stumbled to the seafront where locals called the emergency services.

He was rushed to the private Ahu Hospital where doctors worked round the clock to save him.

His parents maintained a 
round the clock vigil at the hospital where their son remained in 
intensive care following the attack in the early hours of Monday 
morning.

Speaking outside the hospital Mr McNulty's father said: 'He seems to be improving - thanks for asking.'

Josh Stevenson, 19, from Glasgow has been arrested in connection with the attack on Mr McNulty and remanded in custody.

Callum
 Copson, of Kennoway, near St Andrews, suffered a massive wound to his 
stomach two weeks ago after being slashed with a knife during a row over
 a handbag in a shop in Marmaris.

Callum Copson, left, was stabbed in the stomach two weeks ago when he went to a shop in Marmaris to exchange a bag with his girlfriend Erin Brown, right, who has been maintaining a round-the-clock vigil by his bedside

The 19-year-old was said to be on the 'road to recovery' after two life-saving operations, although doctors warned on June 24 that he was 'not out of the woods yet'.

Mr Copson is also still recovering at the hospital.

A 14-year-old local boy has been remanded in custody by a judge awaiting psychiatric reports, in connection with the stabbing of Mr Copson.
