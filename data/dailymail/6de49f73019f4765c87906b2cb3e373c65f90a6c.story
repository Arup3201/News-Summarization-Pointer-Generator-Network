France are out of the World Cup – did anyone notice?

For Les Bleus were Les Miserables as they bid a meek au revoir to the tournament; there was certainly no va va voom.

At least those who fell at the last-16 stage went down fighting.

World's end: France went down without a fight as they were beaten 1-0 by Germany

Winner: Mats Hummels' first-half header proved enough to book Germany's semi-final spot

The French, however, could not even summon the gusto to emerge with such honour.

They had promised so much during a group stage in which they scored eight times, adding two more in their second-round disposal of Nigeria.

But in Rio, against Germany, they surrendered, Mats Hummels' 12th-minute header proving enough to settle a largely staid affair.

In the subsequent 82 minutes - including injury-time - France found the target just five times.

Didier Deschamps was under pressure to drop Olivier Giroud and restore Karim Benzema to a central role, and that he duly did. Benzema, though, failed to repay his manager’s faith.

He 
completed just 12 passes in 90 minutes and, although he managed seven attempts on 
goal, a meagre two troubled Manuel Neuer.

His
 first-half performance - in which his eight touches was the least of 
all 22 players – was particularly subdued and he lacked conviction when a
 pair of chances did come his way, one header rebounding off a defender a shot side-footed tamely at Neuer.

But Benzema’s supporting cast did little to aid the attacking cause either.

Down and out: Benzema and Co barely threatened to reply and went out with a whimper

Too little, too late: Benzema came closest to levelling with a late strike which was saved by Manuel Neuer

Not enough: Benzema was a little more involved after the break but still couldn't find a breakthrough

Yohan Cabaye, the playmaker, created just one chance for a team-mate, while his passing accuracy in the opposition half dipped to 61 per cent compared to 81 in the comfort of defensive territory. The disappointing PSG midfielder was withdrawn when his team should have been chasing a leveller 17 minutes from time.

No French connection: Yohan Cabaye did not exert his influence in the right areas

Easy option: Cabaye was involved, but it was all inside the comfort of his own half

No impact: The playmaker's numbers in the final third make for poor reading

Antoine Griezmann was Giroud's replacement in the starting line-up but the 23-year-old did little to enhance his reputation. The winger's involvement was sporadic and just over half of his 22 passes found a colleague.

Paul Pogba, like Cabaye, failed to impact in the final third, while Mathieu Valbuena's crossing was woefully wayward and just one of his six deliveries located a comrade.

Blaise Matuidi, meanwhile, was unable to carve a single opening despite completing the full game.

Of those introduced in an attempt to snap France from their slumber, Giroud and Loic Remy did not muster one shot on goal between them.

Benzema was denied by Neuer's strong arm in stoppage-time, but it was too little, too late.
