A brutal Ethopian prison guard who tortured inmates with cattle prods in the 1970s has been arrested following a chance encounter in a U.S.restaurant by one of his victims, immigration chiefs claimed today.

Kefelegn Alemu Worku is also said to have beaten prisoners with rifle butts, whips and pipes during a period known as the Red Terror when up to 500,000 people died in a political purge by communist rulers.

Worku was previously known as Tufa when he worked at the notorious Higher 15 detention camp - the site of many executions - according to two former inmates who identified him in a photo line-up.

Arrest: The man was arrested in a cafe frequented by members of the Ethiopian community in Aurora, Colorado

He was spotted in the Cozy Cafe in Aurora, Colorado last May by a another former 
prisoner who recognized him.

Worku was a regular at the cafe, 
which is a hangout for Ethiopian immigrants in the Denver area, said 
restaurant manager Girma Baye.

Worku, who worked at a parking lot and had previous held a job at Denver International Airport, has been 
charged with unlawfully procuring citizenship or naturalization and 
aggravated identity theft.

Power: Mengistu Haile Mariam (pictured) was the most prominent officer of the Derg, Communist military junta that oversaw the Red Terror in Ethiopia during the late 1970s

If convicted of both, he faces up to 12 years
 in prison and fines of up to $500,000.

The Ethiopian who alerted the authorities claims he escaped from the prison in 1979, Homeland Security
 Agent Jeffrey Lembke said.

The three immigrants told authorities 
the man they identified as Worku participated in beatings and torture 
sessions that included a cattle prod, rifle butts, whips and pipes.

They
 also said he threatened at least one witness with an AK-47 at the 
prison where detainees were regularly beaten and executed.

The former prisoners had 'a very strong reason to remember, even though it was 30 years 
ago,' said federal prosecutor Brenda Taylor in court.

Federal public defender Matthew Golla said his client denies all of the charges.

The
 man entered his plea in federal court before being held without bail by
 a judge who noted that he is accused of using several aliases.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix also said the man faces serious accusations involving a detention center known as Higher 15.

It
 was established during the late 1970s in a campaign known as the Red 
Terror, which Human Rights Watch has called 'one of the 
most systematic uses of mass murder by a state ever witnessed in 
Africa.'

Years of suffering: An Ethiopian refugee camp in Ali Sabieh, Djibouti. Ethiopians have suffered terribly from the effects of war and famine during recent decades

Golla
 said his client has lived peacefully in Denver for eight years and 
should be released.

He said he has worked at Denver 
International Airport and is currently employed with a parking lot 
company.
