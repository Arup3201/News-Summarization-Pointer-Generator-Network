A 15-year-old girl without a driver's license took her father's SUV without permission before crashing the vehicle, killing three teenage boys, authorities have said.

The unidentified girl, who may have been speeding, is now facing possible charges in the crash, which killed Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney and Ryan Lesher, all 15, in Wayne County, Pennsylvania.

On Saturday morning, the girl, who was visiting Wallenpaupack Lake Estates from her home in New York, took the car with a 16-year-old friend and picked up four teenage boys to get breakfast.

As the group headed back to the development, the driver lost control on a bend and the vehicle flipped over multiple times.

Witness Marie Drobnicki, who lives nearby, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that she saw the SUV hit a patch of gravel and turn sharply around the bend before it careened out of sight. 

She heard a 'horrific' crash and the sound of shattering glass, she said.

When she walked to the crash scene, she saw a boy lying in the road, another teenager pinned beneath the vehicle and a third lying on her lawn. He appeared to be dead, she said.

Authorities said that Keffer was dead at the scene, while Digney and Lesher died on Saturday afternoon in hospital.

The three were all from Bucks County and were visiting the area. The Inquirer reported that property records indicate Lesher's parents own a house in Wallenpaupack Lake Estates. 

Crash: Witnesses said the SUV was speeding when it hit gravel and turned sharply just a mile from where the group was staying with family. The three boys were killed, while two girls and a boy were injured

The female driver, another girl and the fourth boy were treated and released from area hospitals.

The car, a 2001 Chevrolet Suburban, was registered to the girl's father. WNEP reported that the girl took the vehicle without asking for permission. 

Authorities have not said whether the girl, who was also visiting from Westchester County in New York, was taken into custody but said that any charges would be processed in juvenile court.

'This is a parent's worst nightmare and a terrible tragedy that the Pennsylvania State Police will investigate to the fullest,' Wayne County District Attorney Janine Edwards said.

The boys were all incoming sophomores at Council Rock South High School in Newtown.   

Sadness: The three boys were all incoming sophomores at Council Rock South High School in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Counselors were on site to help students when school started on Tuesday

‘It is with great sadness that we acknowledge the deaths of three sophomores from Council Rock High School South,’ Council Rock Superintendent Mark Klein said in a statement after the deaths.

'Council Rock offers its sincere condolences to the families of these students and to all who are grieving this terrible loss. We ask for your thoughts and prayers for our students and their families.'

Students returned to school on Tuesday and counselors were on hand to support and guidance for students and families.

The Pennsylvania State Police in Honesdale are investigating the crash.
