For those who love the idea of cycling around New York but are put off by the hectic traffic, a Dutch start-up company has created a solution which web users take a bike ride without leaving your sofa.

Entrepreneur Samir Bendida has filmed cycle routes around Central Park and along the Hudson River Greenway and uploaded them online.

The online service, called Cyclodeo, is synchronized with GPS data, allowing web users to check the safety of journeys they hope to cycle from the comfort of their own home.

Cyclodeo, created by Samir Bendidam, allows web users to take a virtual tour of New York and plan future bike rides

Videos uploaded to the Cyclodeo website allow users to see the routes online from the cyclist's perspective

As the Cyclodeo videos are playing footage of the journeys, a moving marker highlights the location of the video on a map.

Each section of the video is geo-coded, which means you can click anywhere on the route to show a visualization from the cyclist's perspective.

Each route uploaded to the website 
shows the duration, elevation and distance of the journeys to help users
plan their bike rides.

Mr Bendida told Mashable he created Cyclodeo as a community platform to help people share their cycling knowledge.

One of the routes users can follow is a bike ride down 11th Avenue from 50th Street in New York City, U.S.

Entrepreneur Samir Bendidam said one of the functions of Cyclodeo was to help users check the safety of routes

The internet sharing platform Cyclodeo syncs videos with maps so cyclists can plan journeys thoroughly

'I wanted to find a way to share my traveling experiences,' he said.

'Cyclists would put their own videos, which share their own cycling rides from all over the world.'

The site only works from desktops at present, but Mr Bendida hopes to develop the service for smartphones and tablets in future.
