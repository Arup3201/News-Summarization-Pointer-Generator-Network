A patient died at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital as she pleaded with nurses ‘Help me’, a disciplinary hearing was told today. 

The woman had got her head stuck between a bed railing and begged for help, but nurse Ann King told an auxiliary worker: ‘Sit down - she’s fine’, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard.

By the time she was checked on the woman’s face had turned purple and she could not be resuscitated, the NMC was told.

A patient died at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital as she pleaded with nurses 'Help me', a disciplinary hearing was told today

Mrs King’s case is the latest in a series of accusations against nurses at the hospital, where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

The nurse is also accused of failing to recognise that another patient, who subsequently died, was diabetic. 

Mrs King and ward manager Jeannette Coulson are accused of making a number of blunders while working in the Trauma and Orthopaedics ward between 2005 and 2010.

Their alleged failings came to light when a Healthcare support worker known as (HCSWA) and another nurse known as (SNA) blew the whistle.

The woman who died in the railings had been admitted to the ward with a broken leg was said to be an alcoholic, and 'appeared to be agitated due to withdrawal'.

‘Patient A was in a side room and could not move from her bed without assistance due to her injury - she was awaiting surgery,’ said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC.

‘During the handover HCSWA could hear Patient A shouting for a bed pan and for some assistance. HCSWA tried several times to get up and attend to Patient A but was repeatedly told to sit down by nurse King. She told him the patient was fine, and that she seen to her earlier.

‘Patient A continued to shout and seemed to be getting more and more agitated and at one point shouted “help me, help me.”’

Ten minutes later the woman became silent and the auxiliary went to check on her, it was said.

‘As he approached the door he saw a puddle of urine coming from under the door and when he entered the room he found Patient A at the bottom of her bed with her head wedged in between the bars in an extended section that pulled put on a trolley for taller patients,’ Miss Wood said.

‘Patient A’s head was swollen and purple and she was not moving. The alarm was raised and emergency CPR commenced, but Patient A could not be resuscitated.’

King did not respond to patient requests, prevented HCSWA from attending promptly to the patient and did not ensure the woman’s safety, it is claimed.

As ward manager, Mrs Coulson failed to ensure the patient’s safety, it is alleged.

As the auxiliary left the patient’s room, he was pushed up against the wall by another nurse, Karen Salt, who said words to the effect of ‘keep your mouth shut,’ it is claimed.

Mrs Coulson witnessed the incident and she looked over towards the assistant him as if to say she agreed with Ms Salt, the tribunal heard.

Both nurses are also accused of failing to recognise that another patient who died under their care, Patient B, was diabetic.

By the time she was checked on the woman's face had turned purple and she could not be resuscitated, the NMC was told. King's case is the latest in a series of accusations against nurses at the scandal hit Stafford Hospital where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly

The woman who had suffered from a stroke was admitted to A&E on April 1, 2007, and was transferred to the Trauma and Orthopaedics ward seven days later.

While in A&E a doctor stated that her blood sugar levels should be checked hourly.

Both Mrs King and Mrs Coulson deny ever being told the woman was diabetic.

‘If they had looked, they would have seen this information recorded in her notes,’ said Miss Wood.

Describing the lead up to Patient B’s death Miss Wood said she had been checked my another nurse had asked for her blood sugar to be tested, and noted that it was very high.

Due to a breakdown in communication Patient B did not receive her diabetes medication.

On April 10, 2007 the patient was found collapsed in her bed.

‘Tests revealed that her blood sugar was now so high, it was off the charts,’ said Miss Wood.

‘An agreement was made with her family that Patient B should not be resuscitated of she arrested again.’

The woman died later that night.

Both nurses had both failed to ensure adequate tests were carried out on the patient and failed to ensure adequate records of her care were kept.

King denies all allegations against her, while Coulson admits using inappropriate language and replacing a sign that stated what times relatives could speak to staff after it had been taken down.

She also admits refusing to accept a patient on the ward after surgery stating: ‘Get her off this f***ing ward’, and swearing at HCSWA when he was unwell.

Neither of the nurses is attending the central London hearing.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
