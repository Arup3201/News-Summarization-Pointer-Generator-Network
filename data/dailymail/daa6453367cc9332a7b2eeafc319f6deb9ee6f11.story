Unhappy: Stuart Lawrence, 35, is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification 'all the time'

Scotland Yard yesterday referred shock police racism allegations by Stephen Lawrence’s brother to the force watchdog.

Describing the claims by teacher Stuart Lawrence, 35, as a ‘very serious matter’, the Metropolitan Police passed his complaint on to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

In a strongly worded statement, the Met said it would not tolerate ‘any form of racism’ and promised strong action if any of its officers were found to have acted in a ‘racist manner’.

Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz said he was ‘astonished’ to learn of Mr Lawrence’s apparent treatment by police.

Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe ordered an investigation hours after Mr Lawrence claimed in yesterday’s Mail that he had been stopped by police up to 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin.

Mr Lawrence alleges officers from Scotland Yard have repeatedly targeted him as part of a sustained campaign of harassment.

The angry father of one, whose teenage brother was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, instructed lawyers to seek redress from the Met following his latest encounter with police in south London.

He said he was moved to act after he was pulled over by two officers who saw him driving his VW Scirocco near his home in Peckham.

Today we can reveal further details of the incident, which has sparked a new crisis in Britain’s biggest police force.

Mr Lawrence said that as he approached his flat on the afternoon of November 16, he looked at the driver of a police vehicle as he passed it and continued to his flat.

While driving down the road, he noticed that the police vehicle had turned around and it drove towards him at ‘great speed’, he said.

The police vehicle pulled up and two officers got out to check his details. When he asked why he was stopped, one officer told him he was ‘naturally suspicious’ of him, he claimed.

But later, he said, the other officer told him he had been stopped under Section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which gives police the power to pull over a vehicle.

Mr Lawrence’s lawyers said that although the law gives officers authority to stop a car, ‘it does not cover the reason for the stop’.

They claim the officers were trying, retrospectively, to ‘justify’ their decision to check his details.

A letter of complaint was sent to Sir Bernard on Tuesday, naming the 
officers allegedly involved in the latest incident and warning of future
 legal proceedings.

Mr Lawrence’s solicitor, Imran Khan, said his 
complaint related specifically to when he was stopped at 5.20pm on 
November 16.

‘That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ he said. ‘That was the
 culmination of a course of conduct over many years which amounted to 
harassment and discrimination based upon his skin colour, his ethnic 
origin.’

He added: ‘We are delighted that they [Scotland Yard] are pursuing it so quickly.’

Mr Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I 
am astonished at the way in which Stuart Lawrence seems to have been 
treated.

No citizen of the UK should be expected to face what appears to
 be a consistent campaign of stop and search.’

Scotland Yard said Mr Lawrence’s complaint would be ‘investigated thoroughly and speedily’.

‘Stop and search is an important tool to combat crime and is supported 
by the community if it is used professionally and fairly,’ it said.

‘The
 Commissioner has made it clear that he will not tolerate any form of 
racism in the Met.

‘Strong action will be taken against any individuals in the Met if they are found to have acted in a racist manner.’

Mr Lawrence’s brother was stabbed to death by a gang of five or six 
attackers in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993, at the age of 18.

The 
original investigation into his death failed to solve the case and was 
dogged by allegations of corruption and racism.

The Macpherson Inquiry later concluded that the Met was ‘institutionally racist’. Only two of the killers have been convicted.

Stuart Lawrence, who is engaged and has a two-year-old son, said he was 
‘angry and frustrated’ and felt there had been little progress in the 
way police deal with black people.

An IPCC spokesman said it was considering Mr Lawrence’s complaint ‘to determine the level of IPCC involvement’.

The watchdog could decide to launch its own, independent investigation, 
to supervise an investigation or to refer it back to the Met to carry 
out an internal inquiry.

Angry: Stuart Lawrence with his mother Doreen

Stop and search powers have been an issue of huge controversy since the Macpherson report branded the police ‘institutionally racist’.

But, while there has been a fall in the overall number of searches, figures suggest a black person remains far more likely to be stopped by police than somebody who is white.

Particular alarm has been raised over a police power known as Section 60. This allows officers to stop and search people and cars where they believe violence or disorder may be about to take place.

A study by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission found police are ‘significantly’ more likely to use Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act against black people than white people.

The power is used most often by the Metropolitan Police, which carried out three-quarters of the stops between 2008 and 2011 – 258,000 in total. The commission found that in 2008-09, the Met stopped 68 out of every 1,000 black people in its area. This fell to 32.8 per 1,000 by 2010-11.

For all ethnic groups in England, it was 3.3 stops per 1,000 people in 2008/09, falling to 1.3 in 2010/11.

The report also highlighted huge rates of ‘racial disproportionality’.

An officer in the West Midlands was 28 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person in 2010/11. In Greater Manchester the figure was 21 times, in the Met 11 times, and for British Transport police it was 31 times.

The most widely used stop and search power is Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. In 2010/11, it was used on 1,222,378 people.

The 2011 census found that 86 per cent of the population classified themselves as white. But, according to the latest Home Office statistics, only 66 per cent of those stopped across England and Wales were white. Some 15 per cent were black and 10 per cent were Asian.

The activities of the Met had a huge impact on the figures. In London (where just under 58 per cent of the population is white), only 43 per cent of those searched defined themselves as white. Three in ten were black, and 16 per cent were Asian.

If the Met’s figures are stripped out of the nationwide statistics, 84 per cent of searches were on white people – broadly in line with the ethnic mix of the country.

Last year, Dr Richard Stone, a member of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry panel, argued that officers who targeted suspects on grounds of their skin colour alone should be prosecuted for misusing public resources.
