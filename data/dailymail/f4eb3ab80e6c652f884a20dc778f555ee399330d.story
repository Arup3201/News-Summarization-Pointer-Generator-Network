Most people would expect to indulge a little over Christmas, but it might be surprising to hear the average person could have eaten a staggering 6,000 calories yesterday - nearly three times the recommended intake.

And festive revellers have been warned, they may not realise the Olympic lengths they need to go to compensate for their Christmas feasting.

A new study has shown you would have to exercise like a champion to burn off those extra festive calories.

Feeling full: A traditional Christmas dinner alone can contain 1,500 calories, just a quarter of the total amount some may have consumed yesterday

The study found it would take gold medal-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton 2,177 laps of the Olympic Velodrome to burn off the 6,000 calories some may have consumed yesterday.

While cycling hero Bradley Wiggins would have to ride 41 miles, the distance from London to Southend, to burn off the 1,500 calories found in an average Christmas dinner alone.

Eating too much over Christmas is a festive hazard but few people realise the Olympic lengths they need to go to to burn off the extra calories.

A new study shows that revellers must exercise like a champion if they want to compensate for their Christmas indulgence.

An average person could eat a staggering 6,000 calories on Christmas Day - almost treble the recommended intake.

Using up the excess energy is a challenge of Olympic proportions - it would take gold medal-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton 2,177 laps of the Olympic Velodrome to burn off.

Huge effort: It would take Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton more than 2,000 laps of the velodrome to burn off 6,000 calories

Olympic Gold medallist Victoria Pendleton however doesn't recommend tackling all that in one go.

She said: 'Some 2,177 laps of the Olympic 
Velodrome would be a bit too much, even for me 

'I recommend building in exercise to 
your everyday routine and making it fun. A cycle ride to the local shops
 is good for you, it also saves on petrol, there’s no struggle to find a
 parking space and it’s enjoyable too.'

The study found Christmas dinner alone - containing an average of 1,500 calories - would equate to Bradley Wiggins cycling 41 miles - the distance from London to Southend to burn off the calories.

The study for Halfords also found that at 600 calories a bottle of festive champagne would be the same as Mo Farah’s 10k run.

And the GB's volleyball team would have to play for a full hour to work off the 200 calories in a prawn cocktail.

Meanwhile, if he wanted second helpings, calculated to be an average of 500 calories, Greg Rutherford would have to spend an hour extra long jumping to compensate.

Halfords has also said a helping of Christmas pudding equates to a Michael Phelps-inspired 2,470 metre swim – 50 lengths of the Olympic pool.

Professional cyclist Rob Jarman, who has worked with the bike retailer to create a more viable fitness routine, said the key to shedding Christmas excess is a sustain plan that is quick and enjoyable.

He said: 'Burning 6,000 calories seems a scary challenge so it's more easily tackled over a longer period in a series of activities that burn 500 calories through the day - such as a 30 minute bike ride at a high intensity.

'What’s important is to get out and be active on a regular basis - we don't all have to go to Olympian lengths to shed the weight.'

Karen Bellairs, cycles manager at Halfords, said:'We know that more and more people are taking up cycling as a way to stay fit and have fun.

'So we wanted to see how cycling fitted into the Christmas fitness regime. It was amazing to find the lengths you have to go to, to burn off your Christmas dinner.'
