Steven Eatwell hanged himself following a trivial row with his girlfriend over dog food

A 28-year-old father-of-two hanged himself following a trivial row with his girlfriend over dog food, a coroner heard today.

Steven Eatwell flew into a rage at his partner Julie Napier over how much dog food to take with them on a trip away on holiday.

The couple exchanged angry words before she left the house in her car.

An inquest heard he then texted his girlfriend of four years saying he was going to kill himself and she rushed back to their home to find him hanging from the stairs.

The tragedy happened the day after cannabis addict Mr Eatwell had decided to give up taking the drug.

Miss Napier told a coroner she thought in hindsight Steven may have been suffering from depression before he took his life.

She said that the couple were planning a trip away to Somerset when they started arguing about how much dog food to take with them for their pet.

She stormed out of their house in Newbury, Berkshire, and the couple continued the row over the mobile phone and a number of texts.

However, when Mr Eatwell threatened to commit suicide, Miss Napier rushed home and found him hanging.

In a statement read out by the coroner, she said: ‘I found him hanging over the stairs.

'Steven was grey in his face and I thought he was already dead.'

Miss Napier said she called for an ambulance and tried to cut him down but he was too heavy.

Paramedics cut the man down and started resuscitation attempts before he was rushed to hospital.

The inquest heard paramedics managed to restart his heart with a defibrillator.

However, he suffered fatal brain damage and died in hospital two days later, on August 8.

Steven Eatwell, who was a regular cannabis smoker, decided to give the drug up the day before he died

Miss Napier said Mr Eatwell was a regular cannabis smoker but had decided to give up the drug the day before he died.

'Him not smoking the cannabis may have made him irrational and led to him taking his life over an argument over dog food.'

The inquest heard that Mr Eatwell had two children - one by Miss Napier and another from a previous relationship.

The youngsters were in Miss Napier’s car on the driveway when she rushed indoors and found him hanging at their home in Newbury.

A pathologist who examined Mr Eatwell’s body after he died at the Great Western Hospital, Swindon, Wiltshire, concluded that he died from hypoxic brain injury caused by self-asphyxia.

Anna Burnside, assistant deputy coroner for Berkshire, recorded an open verdict after saying she couldn’t be sure Mr Eatwell intended to kill himself.

She said: 'I’m not entirely sure whether it was possibly a cry for help rather than an act intending to kill himself.'

Miss Napier and his relatives did not wish to comment after the inquest.
