Click here to read Jon Dolan's assessment of whether former Arsenal man Fabregas will be welcomed to Stamford Bridge.

Arsenal will pocket £5.6million from the sale of former Gunner Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea.

The Spanish midfielder completed his return to London on Thursday in a £30m move from Barcelona, signing a contract in the region of £150,000-a-week.

But the deal will also boost Arsenal's already healthy £100million transfer budget and enable them to pursue striker Mario Balotelli who is among manager Arsene Wenger's summer targets.

In
 addition to the buy-back clause, Arsenal were also believed to have 
struck a deal entitling them to 50 percent of the profit from Fabregas' 
next move.

However,
 Sportsmail understands the payment made to Arsenal in relation to 
Fabregas' move to Chelsea will come from the acceleration of all 
performance clauses, as if they were achieved, from the original deal in
 2011.

Arsenal snubbed the chance to re-sign their former captain but will still benefit from the sale of the 27-year-old to their rivals.

And, in 
announcing his return to the Premier League, Fabregas was quick to 
underline the fact his former club rejected the chance to bring him back
 to the Emirates Stadium.

Fabregas came through the ranks at Arsenal, and went on to captain the side before returning to boyhood club Barcelona in 2011.

Arsenal secured a first-option buy-back clause as part of the £35million deal which saw Fabregas return to Catalonia.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had considered taking up the option once it became clear Barca were looking to sell the midfielder.

But
 with the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta
 and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain already at the club, Wenger decided his 
squad did not need another creative midfielder.

Wenger
 and Fabregas continue to have a close relationship, while it is 
understood returning to north London was Fabregas' preferred 
destination.

Despite
 the fact Fabregas' move to Chelsea has been mooted for several days, 
there remained an element of surprise that Wenger snubbed the 
opportunity to re-sign Fabregas from within the club yesterday.

And
 the ex-Arsenal captain was at pains to point out that it was Arsenal's 
decision to end any potential reunion, and not vice versa.

'Firstly
 I would like to thank everyone at FC Barcelona where I enjoyed three 
wonderful years. It was my childhood club and I will always be proud and
 honoured that I had a chance to play for such a great team.

Right move? Fabregas believes signing for Jose Mourinho's side was the 'best choice'

'I
 do feel that I have unfinished business in the Premier League and now 
is the right time for me to return. Yes, everyone knows that Arsenal had
 the first option to sign me. They decided not to take this option and 
therefore it wasn't meant to be. I wish them well in the future.

'I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice.

'They
 match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win 
trophies. They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible 
manager. I am fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start 
playing.

'It
 was extremely important to me that this transfer was completed before 
the World Cup so that my mind will only be focused on hopefully helping 
my country try to retain the trophy.'

A Barcelona statement confirming Fabregas' exit read: 'FC Barcelona wishes to publicly thank Cesc Fabregas fro his professionalism and dedication during his years at the club, which will always be his home.'
