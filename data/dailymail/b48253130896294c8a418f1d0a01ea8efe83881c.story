Honeytrap: Prostitute-turned-nurse Zhao Hongxia (pictured) secretly film herself having sex with a Chinese Communist Party official after being hired by a construction company to blackmail him

A corruption scandal involving Chinese city officials being secretly videotaped having sex with women hired by property developers - has widened.

Lei Zhengfu, a Communist Party district chief in the southwestern city of Chongqing was sacked last year after a video was leaked online showing him having sex with a young woman.

The images became targets of public derision and disgust over government corruption in China and Lei was fired.

Now state media has revealed that ten other district- and county-level officials in the city's government, party departments and state-owned enterprises who appeared in additional videos - have also been fired.

The films are believed to have been shot by women who were hired by developers to extort construction deals.

The news has further exposed the often shady ties between business interests and local officials in China.

'The incident in Chongqing is not accidental or exceptional,' said Liu Shanying, a politics researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.  'It should be said that it is rather common and that the problem is with corrupted lifestyles.

'The atmosphere of officialdom is far from the traditional morality of ordinary people. Many local officials have lower moral standards than ordinary people, and the power they enjoy makes it easier for them to do immoral things,' Mr Liu said.

The expanding scandal comes as China's newly installed leadership has vowed to crack down on rampant official corruption that threatens the party's legitimacy.

Even as China's new Communist Party chief Xi Jinping has repeatedly pledged to strike hard against corruption, authorities have been faced with a steady stream of bribery cases and other malfeasance.

In recent weeks, Chinese audiences have been riveted by revelations that some officials have amassed multiple properties using duplicate or fake identities.

Soaring real estate prices have pushed home ownership out of reach for many Chinese, so such scandals are especially infuriating to the public.

Zhu Ruifeng, a former journalist who released the first sex tape in the scandal, said at the time that the woman, whose face is not visible in the video, was hired by a construction company to sleep with Lei in return for construction contracts. The company later tried to use the tape to extort more business from Lei.

An official at the Chongqing city propaganda office referred questions about the scandal to reports by the local party newspaper, the Chongqing Daily, which carried a report by the state-run Xinhua News agency.

Revealed: Screenshots from the video showed Mr Lei, the party boss of Chongqing's Beibei District, having sex. Ten more officials from the city have been sacked after similar videos of them were released

Disciplined: The Communist Party held internal investigations into the videos before sacking those involved

Citing the city's anti-corruption 
committee, Xinhua described the developers behind the extortion as a 
'criminal ring' and said the company had 'hired women to seduce local 
officials, covertly filmed their sexual acts and used the videos as 
tools of extortion.' 

The girl filmed having sex 
with Lei was revealed last month as Zhao Hongxia, who was 18 at the time 
the video was filmed in 2007. She reportedly wrote on a blog that she was paid £5,000 
to sleep with Mr Lei which she used to pay for her father's medical 
bills.

Now a 23-year-old nurse, she said she was offered the money by the head of a property company.
