This is the dramatic moment a bare-chested tattooed man emerged from a stolen car and allegedly fired shots at police following a high-speed pursuit across Queensland on Thursday afternoon

NSW police, who had been alerted to the men's impending arrival, used road spikes to stop their car on the Pacific Motorway near the Tugun tunnel.

A Queensland police helicopter tracked the men in a blue Mitsubishi Lancer as they travelled down the motorway.

Police say when the car stopped, a 32-year-old man got out armed with a semi-automatic handgun and fired a shot at an officer.

'He then allegedly fired a number of shots at a passing car,' NSW police said.

Two men (pictured getting out of the car) have been charged with attempted murder after allegedly stealing three vehicles at gunpoint and hitting a police office with a car during their dramatic dash for freedom 

The gun was knocked out of his hand when he was struck by a car and the officer was able to arrest him.

Police say the car's other occupant, aged 20, was arrested without incident.

The two men have been charged with shooting with intent to murder, discharging a firearm to avoid arrest, attempted carjacking and Skye's Law, which relates to the police pursuit.

Both men have been refused bail to appear at Tweed Heads Local Court on Friday. Police in NSW and Queensland expect to lay further charges.

The men are alleged to have begun their crime spree in Caboolture on Thursday morning when they were pulled over by police in an allegedly stolen car.

Police say they fled, hitting an officer's leg with their vehicle. The men then allegedly stole two more vehicles at gunpoint.

The second vehicle, a 4WD, had a woman and a young child inside, with the gunmen reportedly demanding the woman remove the child before they drove off.

They are believed to have ditched the 4WD after realising it was low on fuel and stole a third car, the Lancer, then began their high-speed journey south.
