For almost two decades, school projects, presentations and homemade invites have been adorned with various clip art illustrations.

But as of this week, Microsoft is retiring this tool and replacing it with Bing Image search.

Customers can also still add images from their own files saved on their PC, SharePoint and OneDrive.

In a blog post, Doug Thomas from Microsoft wrote: ‘The Office.com Clip Art and image library has closed shop.

‘Customers can still add images to their documents, presentations, and other files that they have saved to their phones, tablets, and PCs.

‘Customers also still have the ability to add images to their documents using Bing Image Search.’

During the mid-1990s, T/Maker specialised in clip art and developed a library of more than 50,000 copyright-free images.

Microsoft didn’t add clip art files to its software until 1996. It began with 82 images and its library closed with more than 140,000 files.
