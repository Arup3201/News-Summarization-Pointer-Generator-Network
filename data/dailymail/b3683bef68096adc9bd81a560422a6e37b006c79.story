A community in Washington can breathe a sigh of relief: the 15-year-old girl who had been missing since Thanksgiving has been found.

Liz Doucette on Sunday said her daughter Jackie had returned home, although there weren't  details on her 10-day disappearance.

'Thank you all for you support, concern, prayers and help,' Doucette wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to finding the missing teen. 'Words can Never say how greatful we are. JACKIE IS SAFE AT HOME!

'We don't know any details at this time. But we will share them as we get them. Please be patient and understanding. Thank you.'

Search and rescue crews this weekend identified their search for Jackie, 15, who disappeared after she went to let the family cat out of the house on November 27 and never returned to her home in Cheney, just outside of Spokane.

'That's what caused the friction between her and her parents, she let the cat out and the cat got away,' Chief John Hensley, of the Cheney PD, told ABC News. 

'The thought is to avoid getting in trouble for not following instructions - she just ran off.' 

Worried relatives said Jackie had run away before but never for this long. The teen has mental issues and needs constant medication.

'Without the medication she can make poor choices,' Hensley told ABC News.

Relatives had been passing out flyers around the local cities while police searched with ATVs and canine patrols around the area.

'She's out in the cold,' Doucette had toldKVEW-TV.

'I'm afraid she's going to end up getting hypothermia.'

Doucette said the family is trying to remain strong.

'I'm extremely worried, I'm extremely stressed,' she told KVEW-TV. 'I try not to think about the worst, but with these cold temperatures, how could you not?' 

Jackie is described as 4-foot-8, 98 lbs., brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink hooded jacket, blue jeans and pink tennis shoes with purple polka dots.

Any information about Jackie's whereabouts can be sent to the Cheney Police Department at 509-498-9235
