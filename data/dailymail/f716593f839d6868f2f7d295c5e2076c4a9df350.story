This hungry heron has made a real frog's dinner of his morning meal.

The bird seemed unable to swallow the slippery amphibian after he grabbed it in its beak in Kitty Hollow County Park in Missouri City, Texas.

The frog tried to squirm free from its captor resulting in a ferocious tussle between the pair.

But it soon gave up and succumbed to its fate as the bigger bird gulped it down head first.

Heron-dous manners: This hungry heron has made a real frog's dinner of his morning meal

Photographer Nate Chappell captured the scene in his usual spot by the park's swamp.

He explained: 'Each evening for a spell a group of yellow-crowned night herons would fly in to feed on frogs and bugs in the swampy grass there.

'These images show a night heron which has caught a good sized frog.

Cheeky: The amphibian sticks out its tongue as the bird toys with it in its beak

'The heron had to flip the frog in the air several times in order to get it in right position to go down the hatch.

'Finally it was able to swallow the frog and you can clearly see the tongue of the frog sticking out as it awaits its fate.

'The night heron was preoccupied with eating his catch so it allowed me a close approach for some nice photographs.'
