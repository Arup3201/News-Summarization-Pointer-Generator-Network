 It has brought her derision from all angles and built up debts of more than £1million.

But it seems Gwyneth Paltrow is not ready to give up on her lifestyle website Goop just yet.

The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes.

Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity.

Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau.

Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise.

Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online.

‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’

'Conscious uncoupling': Gwyneth coined the term when she announced her separation from Chris Martin on the site - to much mockery

Miss Paltrow has stiff competition in the celebrity lifestyle market.

American actress Blake Lively, 27, recently started her own blog, Preserve, and took a dig at the Oscar-winning star in a recent interview, saying: ‘I’m not trying to show you the perfect life or the aspirational life. It’s real life. It’s not about me.’

Actress Jessica Alba, 33, is also moving into the lifestyle market and accused Paltrow of ‘catering only to the rich’.

And last month, American cookery author Martha Stewart, 73, said Miss Paltrow ‘just needs to be quiet’ about home economics, adding: ‘If she were confident in her acting she wouldn’t be trying to be Martha Stewart.’

Last week, financial reports revealed Goop has built up huge debts and falling shareholders’ funds, with a deficit of £177,788 in 2012 increasing to £523,200 last year.

The firm said its directors ‘are of the opinion that predicted profits will provide sufficient resources to enable the company to continue trading in the foreseeable future’.

In March, Miss Paltrow announced her separation from her husband Chris Martin.

She and the Coldplay singer – who have two children Apple, 10, and Moses, eight - have ‘consciously uncoupled’, she said.
