It was once a skill we all took for granted, but now it appears fewer than one in ten young people can change a plug.

Only eight per cent of 18 to 25-year-olds now say they could confidently rewire a plug without help or instruction, according to new research.

Moreover, only five per cent of young people would be confident unblocking a sink, while only six per cent said they would be happy to bleed a radiator.

Where does this wire go? Just 8 per cent of young people in the UK are confident enough to rewire a plug

An inept 17 per cent said they wouldn't even be confident hanging a picture, with only 12 per cent vowing themselves capable of using a power drill.

Just four per cent said they could put up wallpaper, and more than a fifth (21 per cent), doubted their own ability to assemble flat-pack furniture.

A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the survey, said: 'In the past electrical goods came without a plug attached so it was necessary to know how to wire one.

'Now though our toasters and TVs come with the plugs already fitted so it seems wiring one is becoming something of a lost skill.

'The Easter weekend is traditionally a time to tackle DIY tasks but it seems young people are content to sit back and let Dad take the strain. Let’s hope future generations don’t lose the skills their fathers and grandfathers took for granted.'

Left a bit...: An inept 17 per cenr said they wouldn't even be confident in hanging up a picture up

One man said: 'I still have to ring up my Dad for DIY help. I can just about manage to put a bookshelf together' (picture posed by model)

One young man who took part in the survey said: 'I still have to ring up my Dad for DIY help. I can just about manage to put a bookshelf together, but for anything more complicated I need his help.

'It’s not the end of the world that I’m unable to do certain DIY tasks, I mean, if it weren’t for people like me there’d be no work for plumbers and electricians.'

A woman who took part commented: 'It’s very unattractive in a man not to be able to do simple jobs round the house. Although I have to admit if there is a DIY task I can’t do my first response is to reach for the internet.'

Pretty as a picture: While only 12 per cent can use a power drill, women say they find men not able to do simple DIY unattractive
