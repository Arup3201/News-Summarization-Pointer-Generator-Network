A chronic lack of homes for sale is continuing to drive up house prices with a return of sealed bids and gazumping in some areas.

The number of homes on the market has fallen by 1.6 per cent in the past month, however there was a 2 per cent increase in buyers registered with agents, according to research by Hometrack.

The situation is giving sellers, particularly those in London and the South East, a strong hand, it said. This echoes a Rightmove report showing asking prices up by £220 per day in October to hit an average of £252,418 - largely driven by a London spike.

In demand: The number of would-be buyers looking for properties like these ones in Harrow and Brent, in north west London, has gone up six per cent month-on-month

Hometrack said the percentage of the asking price now being paid by buyers is up to 95.2 per cent, which is second only to the figure of 95.7 per cent seen at the height of the 2007 property boom before the crash.

There are fears that a new property bubble is being stoked by the addition of the Government's Help to Buy boosters to the cheap mortgage cash pushed by the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme.

The market in London and the South East are most at risk of seeing an artificial bubble as buyers, including wealthy foreigners with cash, battle for homes and flats before they are even built.

Nationally, prices have risen by 0.5 per cent in the past month, according to Hometrack. However, the figure is a higher 0.7 per cent in the South East and 0.8 per cent in Greater London. Prices have risen by 3.1 per cent over the past year.

It puts the annual rise in prices as lower than the Rightmove asking prices report, which showed them up 3.8 per cent over the past year. The most recent Land Registry monthly report showed house prices up 3.4 per cent in the year to September, while Halifax reported a 6.2 per cent rise and Nationwide a 5 per cent increase over the same period.

On the up: House prices are rising in more than a third of postcodes, while in most others they are stable and just 1.6% saw a decrease.

Demand from prospective buyers in London surged by more than 6 per cent month-on-month, helping to maintain the upward pressure on prices.

Houses in London take just over four weeks to sell on average amid continued demand from wealthy overseas buyers in the capital, compared with slightly more than eight weeks across England and Wales.

Sellers in the capital are typically achieving 97.2 per cent of their asking price, while the figure is 95.9 per cent in the South East. 

One of the major factors driving the turnaround in the property market this year has been a decline in mortgage rates and increase in availability. This has come as cheap money has filtered through banks and building society's from the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme.

For borrowers with the biggest deposits, two-year fixed rate mortgages have fallen below 2 per cent, while those with 25 per cent of a property's value to put down can fix their mortgage for five years at less than 3 per cent.

But savers have suffered as rates on accounts have plummeted due to lenders no longer needing to compete to get their cash in to fund mortgage lending.

A separate study published by the Halifax today found 70 per cent of the nation expects house prices to rise over the next year.

Hometrack said the North East was the only region not to see any change in prices over the month.

Prices
increased by 0.1 per cent in the East Midlands and the North West, by 
0.2 per cent in Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, by 0.3 per cent in 
East Anglia and the West Midlands, by 0.4 per cent in the South West.

The situation is giving sellers, particularly in London and the South East, a strong hand

A new phase of the Government’s flagship Help to Buy scheme launched this month is set to inject further activity into the housing market as lenders offer state-backed mortgages to aspiring first-time buyers and home movers with deposits as low as 5 per cent.

Lenders representing most of the mortgage
market have now come on board the scheme, although only state-backed 
lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of 
Scotland have unveiled their products under the initiative so far.

In a sign that house prices could push
up further amid surging buyer demand, the shortage of homes for sale 
continued in October as the number of new properties listed dropped by 
1.6%, while the number of new buyers registering with agents rose

Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said that a ‘chronic lack of supply’ has been driving house price growth.

He
said: ‘Growth in new sales being agreed is running at 4-5% per month 
and this is continually eroding the stock of homes for sale.

‘In
contrast, levels of demand have grown by 3% in the last two months. 
Improving confidence amongst buyers has been fuelled by low mortgage 
rates and positive news on a recovering housing market.’
