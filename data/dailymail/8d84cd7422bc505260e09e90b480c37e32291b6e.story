A university student who was harassed by an internet stalker for three years - which turned out to be her own boyfriend - says he has 'wrecked her life'.

Ruth Jeffery, who confided in Shane Webber during the horrific ordeal, contemplated suicide after being bombarded with sexually explicit photos and videos.

She also suffered the indignity of having naked images of herself posted on adult websites and distributed to family and friends, including her parents.

Ultimate betrayal: Shane Webber's online harassment made girlfriend Ruth Jeffery so ill she was prescribed anti-depressants

'Stressed': Ruth Jeffery was badly affected by her boyfriend's online abuse campaign

When police eventually uncovered the 
identity of her tormentor, 22-year-old Miss Jeffery was sickened to 
learn it was her own boyfriend.

School drop-out Webber launched his twisted campaign because he was jealous of Miss Jeffery’s life at Loughborough University.

He is now facing jail after a court heard how he also went online posing as  Miss Jeffery.

He contacted men saying she was 
sexually attracted to them and gave them her university address. One man
turned up at her student house and had to be turned away.

Unemployed Webber, 22, continued his evil campaign despite knowing he was making his girlfriend ill.

She was prescribed anti-depressants, 
developed symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and even stopped 
eating at times.

The abuse affected her so badly that she had to retake 
exams for her computer science course.

Clue: Miss Jeffery eventually realised that some of the detail in the messages could only be known to Webber

Online campaign: Images of Webber and his girlfriend. He hacked into her email account and sent a naked picture of her to her contact list, including her father

Webber pleaded guilty to causing 
harassment, alarm or distress at Southampton magistrates’ court, and 
will be sentenced next month.

Yesterday Miss Jeffery said she was still trying to have some of the naked pictures of her he posted on the internet taken down.

‘I want him to be put in prison because he has wrecked the past three and a half years of my life,’ she said.

‘We were really close. We did everything together. I would tell him everything.’

The couple met at school when they were both 11.

Evil campaign: Webber continued to stalk his girlfriend despite knowing that it was making her ill

They were teenage sweethearts but split up before reuniting in 2007, when Miss Jeffery was in the sixth form.

But Webber had dropped out of school 
at 14 and Miss Jeffery believes he may have been trying to stop her from
obtaining a degree because he had no qualifications himself.

He began his campaign of abuse by 
setting up multiple fake email addresses to pose as former 
schoolfriends. He used these to send sexually explicit photos and videos
to Miss Jeffery.

He then began impersonating her and distributing photos of her to family and friends, as well as online.

Miss Jeffery added: ‘It made me feel sick and so stressed because it was happening every single day.

‘There were times when I phoned up my mum and said, “I don’t want to be alive any more”.

'Possessive': Miss Jeffery believes jealousy could have been behind Webber's motive for harassing her. She is studying for a degree while he dropped out of school at the age of 14

‘I just didn’t want to do anything. The whole time I felt a person was watching me and finding out what I was doing.’

At one point Miss Jeffery became 
suspicious that her boyfriend was the culprit as only he had access to 
the photographs and certain information used in the emails.

But Webber, of Nottingham, convinced 
her that they had been stolen from his computer by a friend. Miss 
Jeffery reported the friend to police and his computer was seized.

When no trace of the emails or photos was found Webber came up with more lies about how they could have been taken.

He was eventually caught when police traced an email to his computer.

Miss Jeffery said: ‘Throughout the 
whole relationship, he was a bit controlling and possessive. If I 
didn’t go to see him the  moment I had some free time, he would 
complain.

‘I want people to realise it has not 
been me sending the photos and messages, and I want the case to put 
other people off from doing the same thing.’
