Mesut Ozil could be in line for an earlier comeback than the 2015 date Arsenal have scheduled him in for following an injury to his knee ligaments in October.

The World Cup winner was pictured heading to training on Friday alongside goalkeepers Wojciech Szczesny and Damian Martinez -  an image that will be an early Christmas gift to all Arsenal fans.

With the news that Aaron Ramsey will be absent for around four weeks with a hamstring injury, Ozil's potential return is a timely boost for Arsene Wenger with the hectic Christmas schedule approaching.

Ozil attended the match against Newcastle on Saturday as Arsenal appear to be building some momentum on the pitch ahead of the festive fixtures.

They followed up an emphatic 4-1 victory away to Galatasaray in the Champions League with another rout of the same scoreline at home to Newcastle, one of the Premier League's most in-form teams.

Striker Olivier Giroud powered Arsenal into the lead at the Emirates Stadium with a marvelous header before Santi Cazorla lifted the ball over the onrushing Jak Alnwick for a sublime finish early in the second half.
