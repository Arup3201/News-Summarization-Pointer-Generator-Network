Voters prefer the Tories to run the economy whether or not they believe it is recovering, a poll has found.

Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman, conducted the survey to test the idea that Britons might think differently about who they want in charge depending on the state of the economy.

But – in a blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls – voters still much prefer the Tories, regardless of whether they are told the economy is getting better or getting worse.

The Lord Ashcroft survey found that when the economy is in trouble, 45 per cent of voters including 20 per cent of Labour supporters, back Cameron and Osborne

With the recession over and the economy now recovering, 48 per cent trust the Tories to best manage the economy, compared to just 29 per cent who back Miliband and Balls

The poll asked whether people most trusted David Cameron and George Osborne or the Labour pair.

The sample was split, with half asked whom they most trusted ‘with our economy facing serious problems and challenges in the months ahead’; the other half, whom they preferred ‘now that the recession is over and the economy is recovering’.

Some have suggested that people might prefer the Tories when thinking about the tough decisions needed, or when reminded of the good economic news that was starting to come through.

On the other hand, they might be more inclined to go back to Labour if they felt the hard economic work had now been done and less was at stake.

Trusted on the economy: David Cameron, left, and George Osborne, came ahead of the Labour leaders for economic competence regardless of whether the economy was in a poor or good state, a poll said

Far behind: Ed Miliband, left, and Ed Balls, right, came either 17 or 19 points behind the Tories, depending on the question

In fact, the framing of the question made very little difference.

The question indicating the economy was still in dire straits saw the Tory pair take a 17-point lead (45 per cent to 28 per cent); while the more positive question led to a 19-point lead (48 per cent to 29 per cent).

Worryingly for Mr Miliband, more than 20 per cent of Labour voters prefer Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘This is clearly disturbing for Labour.’
