Southampton midfielder Jack Cork will delay a decision on his future until later in the season.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman has revealed that the club have offered the former Chelsea man a new deal.

His existing contract expires at the end of the season when he is free to join another club in a potentially lucrative move.

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman said Cork has been offered a new deal and has a decision to make

However, he is no rush to pen a new deal and is likely to wait and see what options become available before making a final decision.

Cork is working his way back to full fitness following an ankle injury that caused him to miss the hectic festive period.

Koeman said recently: 'The board of the club is talking to him and his agent, we've offered him a contract.

'He can stay. Jack Cork by himself has to say yes or no. We are waiting.'
