A 37-year-old man has been charged after allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl through her bedroom window - only to be chased down the street and tackled by the child's father and uncle.

Ethan Odom reportedly snatched the unidentified youngster after he leaned through her window at her family's  home in Santa Clarita, California, last Thursday and told her to 'come toward him'.

Donning a hooded top, he then ran down the street with the child, prosecutors claim. However, he was stopped when the girl's father and uncle - who had apparently heard a commotion - gave chase.

Once they caught up with Odom, the pair tackled him to the ground, it is alleged.

Charged: Ethan Odom (pictured in court, dressed in white and behind bars, with his face hidden) has been charged with allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl through her bedroom window in Southern California

Terrifying: The 37-year-old reportedly snatched the unidentified youngster after he leaned through her window (pictured) at her family's home in the Newhall area of Santa Clarita last Thursday and told her to 'come to him'

Now, Odom has been charged with kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and residential first degree burglary at a San Fernando court, according to Eyewitness News.

During his first court appearance on Monday, he denied the charges. Although camera crews were allowed into the courtroom, they were not permitted to take photos of the suspect's face.

Shockingly, Odom is also accused of attempting to kidnap a nine-year-old girl around a block away from the three-year-old's home - just hours before allegedly snatching the younger victim.

In the first incident, he had reportedly tried and failed to lure the girl away from her mother as they had walked down the street, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.

In the second alleged attack, at around 7pm last Thursday, Odom -  who was 'wearing a hoodie', family members said - allegedly pulled a screen off the girl's bedroom window and leaned in.

'He leaned in the window and then told her to come toward him,' the youngster's aunt, Adriana, told KTLA 5, adding that her entire family had been in the house during the 'frightening' attack.

The suspect then grabbed the child and dragged her away from the house in the 24200 block of Arch Street in the Newhall area of the city, before running down the street with her, deputies said.

However, after the girl's father and uncle heard a commotion and realized she was missing, they reportedly chased her attacker down the road until they were just feet away from him.

'I actually … ran behind him,' said the girl’s uncle, whose name is Jesus. 'I think he heard my footsteps and then he turned around quickly and asked me if this was my daughter.'

After Jesus told Odom that the girl was his daughter the suspect handed her back to him and tried to flee, her relatives told NBC.

Shocked: 'He leaned in the window and told her to come toward him,' the girl's aunt, Adriana (pictured), said

Emergency response: On Monday, Odom was charged with kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and residential first degree burglary at a San Fernando court, Above, deputies are pictured at the scene last Thursday

But he was stopped when the girl's father suddenly tackled him, knocking him to the ground before restraining him. When deputies arrived at the scene, they were able to take Odom into custody.

In the statement last week, the Sheriff's Department said: 'A male adult allegedly grabbed ahold of a 3-year-old female by reaching through a bedroom window at the female’s residence.'

The Department said the girl had been safely returned to her relatives and was startled, but not harmed. It added that deputies have set up a perimeter at the scene.

Official: During a press conference last Friday morning, Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Dubin (pictured) described the incident as a 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen' at the girl's home

During a press conference last Friday morning, deputy Joshua Dubin described the incident as a 'scary' and 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen'.

Although the name of the girl has not been released, officials have said there is no apparent relationship between her and Odom, CBS reported.

Odom, who has a long criminal history, faces up to 13 years and four months in prison if convicted.

On Monday, his bail was set at $285,000. He is expected to return to court on January 27.
