Chelsea captain John Terry revealed he advised referee Phil Dowd to send off Swansea's Chico Flores during the Blues' 1-0 win at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday.

Flores committed two cautionable offences within two minutes and after the second of these was dismissed following a lengthy deliberation by Dowd.

Chelsea players swarmed round the referee and Terry admitted: 'I told the referee, "That's a second yellow card for me.

'He gave him one a couple minutes before on the halfway line and that one just outside the box is probably even more a yellow than the other one.

'Fair play to Phil, the ref, it was a big decision to make and I thought he made the right one and credit goes to him for that.

'I'm speaking as a Chelsea player, but when we all sit back and look at it then it's definitely two yellows. It's simple as that.

'If it's a minute, two, five minutes into the game and it is a yellow or red card then it doesn't matter. Thankfully we managed to take advantage.'

Swansea boss Garry Monk added: 'For their bench and manager to [then] surround the fourth official, and their players surround the referee himself, and then the red card comes so [much] later on, it makes you wonder.'

Terry believes Chelsea have managed to keep the pressure on their title rivals with the victory.

Rodgers' men pull five points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier 
League table, but Chelsea cut that gap to just two points thanks to Demba Ba's second-half strike.

Terry told Sky Sports 1: 'We obviously knew about it and looking at the result, it's probably the one we wanted.

'It
 was important, as the manager said before the game, that we knew that 
regardless of that result if we don't win our games we'll make it very 
easy for them.

'But we've won our game and the pressure is still on the teams above and below us.

'I think patience was the key today especially after they had their man sent off not long into the game.

'Sometimes we weren't patient or at our best but we got the three points today and we'll take them home.'

Senegalese striker Ba, who scored the goal that ensured Chelsea's progression to the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, was pleased to make another winning contribution after spending much of the season on Mourinho's bench.

'Not a bad week,' he said. 'I'm happy for the team, for me and for my family.

'I never stopped believing. I knew that the manager always likes to keep three strikers and in a moment like this I knew I would get the opportunity to come in and do something.'
