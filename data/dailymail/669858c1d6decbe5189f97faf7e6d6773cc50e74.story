The son of Australia's richest woman, Gina Rinehart, has called his youngest sister an 'oxygen thief' in the latest battle over the family's multi-billion dollar trust, a Sydney court has heard.

The youngest Rinehart, Ginia, has sided with her mother against her siblings and the NSW Supreme Court heard on Tuesday that John Hancock had expressed contempt toward her.

But Bianca Rinehart, who temporarily fell out with Mr Hancock, defended his comments despite telling her mother in 2004 she was 'deeply concerned about (his) reckless bite the hand that feeds you approach'.

Bianca Rinehart, the eldest daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, appeared at Sydney's Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue why she should be allowed to take control of a $5 billion family trust

'(It's) not a personal attack,' Bianca told the court.

She added that her brother's drinking and gambling problems had been 'damaging in the past'.

'He doesn't want to see the family business left in the hands of someone ... he feels isn't up to the job,' she said.

The contempt Mr Hancock had for Ginia was born of worry about who would be 'assuming real and great responsibility of taking over the family company', according to Bianca.

She and Mr Hancock have since reconciled, with Mr Hancock backing her bid to take charge of the family's $5 billion trust.

The court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett an email encouraging him to convince  Bianca to withdraw her bid to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box', the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

He later forwarded the email to his friend Bianca.

The youngest Rinehart, Ginia, was not the only one who angered her older brother.

Bianca, Ms Rinehart's eldest daughter, said her younger sister Hope Welker 'was pretty much at her wit's end' and felt 'kicked in the stomach' after the way she was treated by Mr Hancock.

'All I feel is pain and anxiety. You are kicking me in the stomach,' Hope emailed her brother in February 2013, Bianca told the court.

Ms Welker has withdrawn from the protracted legal debate for control of the family trust, distressed at the way it was proceeding, and dealing with her own divorce.

Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their mother Gina acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her children as the beneficiaries

Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their mother acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her children as the beneficiaries.

So far, every proposal for a replacement trustee - including Bianca, Mr Hancock and independent trustees - has been knocked out of contention during lengthy court proceedings.
