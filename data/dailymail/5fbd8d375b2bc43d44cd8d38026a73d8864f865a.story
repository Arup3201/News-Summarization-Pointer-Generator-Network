Meanwhile, Diafra Sakho has recovered from a shoulder injury and is in line to make a welcome return to the squad for Saturday's Barclays Premier League match against Aston Villa.

The summer arrival from Metz was forced to sit out the 2-2 draw at Stoke over the weekend after suffering the knock in the recent victory over reigning champions Manchester City.

Stijn Vandenbrouke, West Ham's head of medical and sports science, has revealed Sakho will be back at Upton Park on Saturday.

'Diafra ran individually on Monday at Chadwell Heath and will be available for the game,' Vandenbroucke told the club's official website.
