Pensions minister Steve Webb has hinted the Government is going to extend the scheme to current pensioners

Ministers are expected to unveil plans in the Budget next month which would allow millions of pensioners to cash in their annuities.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb has given his strongest indication yet that the Government will launch a consultation into the radical proposal imminently.

The changes will give five million retirees the same freedoms as those who have not yet taken their pension.

Under reforms to be introduced in April, workers will no longer have to buy an annuity – an annual income for life – when they retire, and can instead cash in all or part of their savings.

But until now this freedom has not applied to existing pensioners who have already bought an annuity.

At a conference for the Association of British Insurers yesterday, Mr Webb hinted the Government was going ahead with plans to extend the scheme to current pensioners.

The changes will help people who are locked into low-paying annuities, who would rather cash it in and spend the lump sum.

Insurers would buy the annuity from the pensioner and, in return, the firm would be entitled to that person’s monthly income until they died.

Experts predict the Government will announce a consultation in the Budget to woo the ‘grey vote’ in the run-up to the General Election.

Around five million pensioners hold six million annuities, worth about £11billion a year, according to Government figures.

Mr Webb said early talks with pensions providers had been positive, saying: ‘I have not heard any compelling argument against the proposition [to allow annuities to be sold].’

He told the Mail there was ‘growing interest in how this will work’ and that he was working on the details.

The proposition, he said, was simple. ‘I have a stream of income. I would rather have capital. Someone then buys it from me – I envisage a financial institution rather than an individual,’ he said.

He denied that many people could be ripped off by insurers and pension firms, who may pay offer paltry sums for a valuable lifetime income, explaining: ‘Lots of these annuities were taken out, say, five years ago, when interest rates were way higher, so that stream of income would cost a fortune to buy now – that will make the deal more attractive.’

He added that retirees would need to be aware that transaction fees and consultation fees could soon erode a very small annuity.

Pensions expert Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was ‘very likely’ that the Government would announce a consultation about the sale of annuities, an idea which ‘sounds attractive in principle’.

But he warned: ‘There is, however, a significant risk of consumer detriment and mis-selling and the costs of any system like this may well outweigh any possible benefits.’
