A brother and sister were rushed to the hospital in critical condition after falling out of a ferris wheel at a Chelsea, Michigan fair.

Natasha McElrath, 16, was trying to stop her 8-year-old brother from falling out of the seat at the Chelsea Community fair when they both tipped out.

The McElrath siblings were taken to the University of Michigan CS Mott Children's Hospital in critical condition, but are now improving. Chelsea Fair Board President Rick Boham says their injuries are not life-threatening.

Accident: A brother and sister were seriously injured when they fell out of a ferris wheel at a Michigan county fair on Thursday

The incident Happened Thursday night around 9pm, when Natasha and her brother got into a ferris wheel chair.

Natasha, having recently suffered a leg injury, brought her crutches onto the ride and set them on the floor of the chair.

When the wheel started turning, the crutches got jammed in a bracket bar above their car and the two siblings tipped forward and fell about seven to 10 feet to the ground.

After the McElrath children were taken to the hospital, the fair shut down the ferris wheel while the state inspector looked over the ride.

The fair president said mechanical failure had been ruled out in the incident.

Natasha and her brother were last reported improving at the hospital, though the 8-year-old boy did receive cuts and lacerations to his face.

The McElrath's mother told WXYZ that the accident could have been prevented if there were better safety restraints on the bars.
