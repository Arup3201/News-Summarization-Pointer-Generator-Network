A puppy born with deformities in both his front legs has found a new lease of life after being fitted with specially designed 3D-printed prosthetics.

When Derby was born in August 2013, his original owners in Alabama had considered sending him to a shelter to be euthanized.

Instead he was taken in by Peace and Paws Dog Rescue, a non-profit dog shelter with a no kill policy in New Hampshire.

No stopping him now: Derby took to his new prosthetics immediately and he now wears them every day to run two to three miles with his owners

The puppy was born last year with deformities in both his front legs, but has found a new lease of life after being fitted with specially designed 3D-printed prosthetics

Derby was first fostered by Tara Anderson, right, who works for 3D Systems and then during the Summer he was he adopted by Dom and Sherry Portanova, left, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania

In April, Derby was fostered by Tara Anderson, who works for 3D Systems, a South Carolina-based company specializing in 3D printing.

Initially Derby was fitted with a cart that allowed him to move with some mobility, but Anderson told BuzzFeed that she wanted to see if she could print prosthetic legs to allow the high-energy dog to run and play more freely.

With the help of her colleagues at 3D Systems, she began designing and testing prosthetics for Derby.

A CAT scan was taken of his front legs which provided the data needed to turn thousands of layers of 2D photos of Derby’s limbs into the 3D geometry that would then be printed.

By June, Derby had been adopted by Dom and Sherry Portanova in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and Anderson regularly visited them to test out different designs for Derby's new legs.

After several experiments, Anderson settled on a design called ‘elbow cups’ and in November Derby tried his new limbs for the first time

His new limbs allow Derby the freedom and mobility to be able to play with other dogs

A process called MultiJet printing allowed 3D Systems to produce a prosthetic containing both the rigid and flexible materials needs to provide Derby with some comfortable to wear but durable enough to withstand his weight.

After several experiments, Anderson settled on a design called ‘elbow cups’ and in November Derby tried his new limbs for the first time.

Derby took to his new prosthetics immediately and he now wears them every day to run two to three miles with his owners. 

'The first time he was put on the prosthetics and he took of running he was just so happy. I was absolutely amazed,' said Sherry Portanova.

Anderson now hopes the technology can be used to help other dogs who have either had accidents or were born with deformities.
