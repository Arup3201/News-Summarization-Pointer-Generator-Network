Ever the romantic, Barack Obama used the opening moments of the first 2012 presidential election debate, to acknowledge his 20th wedding anniversary to wife Michelle.

The President opened with the words: 'Twenty years ago I became the luckiest man on the earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. I just want to wish, you, sweetie, happy anniversary.'

He promised that next year, their celebration would not take place before 40 million viewers.

Romney also had words of congratulations for the first couple before the debate got underway in Denver, Colorado.

Dressed to impress: Ann Romney in a white suit and pearls and Michelle Obama in a purple outfit with patterned blouse

Romney joked to Obama: 'I’m sure this was the romantic place you could imagine, here with me.'

MR PORTER.COM this week published an article on how politicians should be dressing for success. Here, the site's Style Director, Dan May, tells MailOnline what he made of the two candidates' style:

'It is evident that both candidates were dressed appropriately and expectedly for round one, towing their party lines by color - blue tie for President Obama, and a striped red for Governor Romney.

'Both men looked clean and handsomely dressed, they wore their campaigns right.

'A stylistic thing of note - less is always more - and President Obama’s smaller American flag pin was a nice-sized touch.'

Before their husbands attacked each other on stage, it was hugs and kisses between Michelle Obama and Ann Romney as they met last night, front of center-stage, ten minutes before the event.

Mrs Romney, 63, looked
relaxed in a knee-length, cream suit with long sleeves as she placed 
her hand on the First Lady's back while the pair firmly shook hands and smiled politely.

Both women opted for a block color, structured outfit.

Romney, a mother-of-five, looked suitably conservative having accessorized with pearls and bracelet watch for the event in Denver, Colorado.

Mrs Obama, 48, appeared regal in an indigo, three-quarter sleeve jacket and matching dress with floral print, silk bodice. The outfit comes from the Fall 2011 collection of London designer Preen where dresses can cost up to $2,250.

It was games backstage for the Republican camp as the Romney family indulged in a game of Jenga before the night's proceedings.

She was dressed in a belted, 
checked skirt and black vest top for the event on October 3rd - also her 20th wedding anniversary.

Both Obamas took to Twitter to send 
each other celebratory greetings, and Barack also tweeted a photograph 
of the young couple on their wedding day.

The President wrote: 'Twenty years ago today, I married the love of my life and my best friend. Happy anniversary, Michelle.'

Mrs
Obama replied: 'Happy 20th anniversary, Barack. Thank you for being an 
incredible partner, friend, and father every day. I love you!'

The First Lady admitted in an earlier interview that celebrating her wedding anniversary at a debate was not her ideal.

She said: 'I told Barack, ''This, you know, 
attending a presidential debate on my 20th anniversary is probably the 
worst way for me to spend (it).'' ... I get so nervous at these 
debates.'

Ann Romney said 
that she and husband Mitt have an 'emotional connection' during debates 
and that he looks for her after speaking, according to an interview with
CNN.

After months of attacking each other -
directly and indirectly - Romney and Obama faced off in the 
same room for the first time in a clash which could determine who 
occupies the White House for the next four years.

Mr
Obama also started by attempting to divert the argument away from his 
record over the past four years and towards America's prospects for the 
next four as he said the debate should concentrate 'not on where we've 
been but on where we're going'.
