A nursery is under investigation after a toddler apparently wandered out from the premises and ran across an 'extremely dangerous' dual carriageway.

The curious toddler walked out of Juneberries Day Nursery in Romford, Essex, and allegedly ran across three lanes of 50mph traffic on the A12.

It was only when a terrified passer-by saw the young boy, about 50 yards away from the nursery, that his adventure came to an end.

A spokesman for Havering Council said it was 'hugely concerned' about the incident, which allegedly took place on Friday last week.

The spokesman confirmed the nursery - which closed this week to have 'urgent construction work' - is now being probed by a joint team from Ofsted, the council and the police.

But amazingly, the nursery refused to publicly apologise for the mess - which could have cost a 
young child his life.

A spokeswoman at the nursery said: 'We have nothing to say, we do not want to apologise.'

The shocked motorist who spotted the boy said that it was lucky there were no cars coming.

She said: 'I saw him run across the road. He was about three.

The child was spotted on Eastern Avenue by a motorist who stopped to bring the young boy to safety

Havering Council has confirmed it is launching a joint investigation with police and Ofsted over the allegations

'Me and my daughter got out the car and screamed for him to stay.

'He fell to the floor and my daughter scooped him up. Time stood still - amazingly there were no cars coming.'

Parents of children who attend Juneberries were not informed about what happened.

Instead,
 a text message was sent to parents, saying the nursery would be closed on 
Monday and Tuesday due to 'urgent construction work for children 
safety'.

It is not known whether the young boy escaped through a gate.

The nursery, which according to its 
latest Ofsted report has 27 youngsters on the books, is housed on the 
site of a church, St John The Divine, about 15 yards away from the 
carriageway.

A Havering Council spokesman confirmed they would be working with police and Ofsted to establish the facts of the incident.

The spokesman said: 'We are hugely concerned that a child has been able to leave a nursery and find their way onto an extremely dangerous road.

'We will be looking into how this was allowed to happen so we can ensure the safety of all children in our nurseries.'

A spokesman for Ofsted told MailOnline: 'Ofsted is aware of the allegation and is working with the local authority, police and the provider to investigate the matter.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police was unavailable for comment.
