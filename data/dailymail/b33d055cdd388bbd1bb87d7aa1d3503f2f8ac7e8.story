He's the design supremo behind Louis Vuitton and two hugely successful labels of his own but it seems Marc Jacobs isn't content to confine his talents to fashion.

Buoyed by a string of top-selling perfumes, Jacobs has launched a beauty line in collaboration with Sephora that also includes a range developed specifically for men.

'I personally tested all the products,' the New York designer said of his new Boy Tested, Girl Approved range on his website. 'Witness my brow and my luscious lips'

His favourite: Jacobs loves the palladium tip of his new Rescue Concealer and says he will be using it

In a video released to accompany the launch, Jacobs is seen talking male would-be shoppers through his favourite products, which, adds the designer, are always to be found in his 'trousse de toilette'.

'There are products that I like to use personally and I felt could be unisex,' he begins before launching into his favourite: the Remedy Concealer.

'There's the Remedy concealer that has a really lovely palladium tip that really feels nice and cool to your undereye area, and God knows I can always use a bit of Remedy Concealer myself,' he explains.

'Then there's the brow tamer which has a lovely soft application wand and the formula itself is soft and smooth feeling rather than sticky and gooey or hard.

'[Finally] there's the Liplock which has a nice minty fresh taste. It's very important to have a nice moist lip so you're always ready to kiss and make out with that right person.

Highly groomed stars such as David Beckham and George Clooney have made male beauty more acceptable

Men's range: Like Jacobs, Tom Ford is also to launch a collection of grooming products for men

'Those are my three essentials, the ones I'll be using, the ones you can find in my trousse de toilette all the time.'

The range, which starts at £15, also includes a seven-shade eyeshadow palette  for £37.

Male grooming has become an increasingly lucrative part of of the beauty industry, with men apeing well-groomed stars such as David Beckham and George Clooney.

Unsurprising then, that the Marc by Marc Jacobs designer isn't the only fashion tycoon with his eyes on the lucrative male grooming market.

Next month, Tom Ford is to launch a range of male products, which will join his hugely successful women's beauty collection.

The new products will include a concealer, cleanser, mud mask and bronzer, as well as two new fragrances.

In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, John Demsey, group president of the Estée Lauder Cosmetics said the new range is 'aimed at enabling men to present their best self.'

'The man who’s shopping this category, in this distribution, feels very comfortable having this discussion,' he added.

'This is a serious, high-ticket men’s grooming line, with a couple of products with cosmetics benefits to be used in a very masculine way.'

And the male rush to the make-up counter has been noticed in British department stores too, including Debenhams who reported a 24 per cent rise in sales of male grooming products according to the Telegraph.

A spokesman added: 'Many are looking to achieve a groomed look rather than look too rugged.'
