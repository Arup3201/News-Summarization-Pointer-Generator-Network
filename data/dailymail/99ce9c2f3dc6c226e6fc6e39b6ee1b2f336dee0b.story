Robin van Persie demonstrated his skills on the football pitch by bagging a brace against Southampton - then showed his class by giving his shirt to a girl in the crowd.

The forward scored both of Manchester United's goals at St Mary's as Louis van Gaal's men left the south coast with a 2-1 victory on Monday night.

And after the final whistle the Dutchman walked over to the section of the stadium where United's travelling supporters were gathered and handed his shirt over to a lucky girl in the crowd.

Van Persie's brace came either side of a Graziano Pelle strike for Southampton as United managed to grind out a victory despite struggling to get their attacking game going.

The Red Devils have now won five games on the bounce and occupy third spot in the Premier League - their highest position since they won the title back in 2012-13.
