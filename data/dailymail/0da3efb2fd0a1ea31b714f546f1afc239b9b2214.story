The mother of a teenager with Type 1 diabetes has revealed how she’s sometimes too scared to go to sleep in case she misses checking her daughter’s blood sugar levels in the night – something that could be fatal.

Grace Chamberlain, 15, from Fort Worth in Texas, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2006. The disease caused her immune system to eat her own pancreas, which left her body unable to produce insulin, a hormone that helps the body use food for energy.

There is no cure for the disease and Grace could die in minutes if she’s not given the right quantity of insulin at the right time.

Her mother, Patricia, and father rotate getting up and midnight, 3am and 6am to check Grace’s blood sugar levels and their daily struggle to keep her alive has been turned into a film – called Midnight Three & Six. 

On the film, first shown by The New York Times, Patricia says: ‘Do I fear sleep? Yeah, if I’m on duty I do.’

Grace is also helped by a diabetic alert dog, Jackie, who can sense when her glucose levels are too low and give her a nudge to get them checked.

Since being diagnosed with T1D, Grace has endured 34,000 blood tests. 5,552 shots and 1,660 medical tubing injections, according to her fundraising page.

It’s been set up to fund artificial pancreases for Grace and other T1D sufferers.

The page emphasizes how the disease can affect anyone, regardless of health and lifestyle.

It says: ‘This disease strikes without warning regardless of diet or lifestyle, and can occur in anyone. There is nothing in the market to prevent T1D, and – at present – nothing that can get rid of it.

‘Too much exercise, wrong measurements of food or insulin can be fatal. Blood glucose must be monitored on average 8 - 12 times a day by pricking the finger for blood. Treatment kits are carried around the clock. Yet even all this cannot fully prevent organ failure, or a host of the disease’s more serious effects, such as blindness, nerve damage, heart attacks, strokes, and pregnancy complications.’

Despite her condition Grace tries to be philosophical and upbeat about life.

She says: ‘It’s just scary. One day I could here, and one day I could just not. So I guess I kind of appreciate the little things more.’

Dr Ian Campbell, from Park House Medical Centre in London, is optimistic that we will one day be able to manage Type 1 diabetes far more easily.

He told MailOnline: 'Type 1 Diabetes is a terrible disease that seems to strike at random and without warning. It may be viral. We don't know. But for those that suffer it, it means a sudden and complete failure of the pancreas to produce insulin and causes a rise in blood glucose.

'There is, sadly, nothing that we can do to prevent it from happening. Once present, insulin injections are the only treatment. I'm sure one day we'll look back at daily insulin injections and think of them as a throw back to the old days. We need to keep searching for a much simpler, safer, less intrusive way of controlling blood levels of glucose and insulin and helping people with Type 1 diabetes live normal, productive lives much more easily.'
