Manny Pacquiao swapped the boxing ring for the basketball court this weekend as he made his professional basketball debut on Sunday, just a month before he is set to defend his WBO welterweight crown.

Pacquiao started Sunday's game for the newly formed KIA Sorento of the Philippine Basketball Association.

The 35-year-old played only seven minutes and committed two turnovers in his team's 80-66 win over the Blackwater Elite at Philippine Arena.

Boxing icon Pacquiao, who joined the pro league team as a player-coach, played in a pre-season game earlier this month, finishing with one point and two turnovers after a 10-minute stint.

Pacquiao said after the game he would take a break from his KIA duties to focus on the defence of his WBO welterweight crown on November 22 in Macau against undefeated junior welterweight champion Chris Algieri.

At 5ft 6in tall, Pacquiao does not have the typical stature of a basketball player, but is a big fan of the sport.
