Two gunmen accused of murdering Anni Dewani on her honeymoon have been told they must remain in custody while a High Court decides whether the bride's husband Shrien will be extradited from the UK to stand trial with them, a South African court heard today.

Alledged gangsters Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, appeared in court charged with murdering Mrs Dewani, who was shot dead when her taxi was hijacked in Cape Town, in November 2010.

But South African authorities have asked for the pair to remain in custody and for a pre-trial hearing to be put back until a decision is made on Mr Dewani's appeal against extradition from the UK.

Senior state advocate Shareen Riley told Western Cape High Court in South Africa 
today that Mr Dewani would appear alongside Mr Qwabe and Mr Mngeni if his appeal is unsuccessful.

This would make him the fourth suspect involved in the case, after taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed after he admitted setting up the murder and claimed Mr Dewani offered to pay him Â£1,335 to take his wife 'off the scene'.

But the news comes as further delays in 
obtaining vital evidence for the trial were revealed - with DNA and 
blood samples still not gathered from the two accused, despite the pair 
already being held in custody since her murder 15 months ago.

Businessman Shrien Dewani is waiting to hear the result of his High Court appeal against extradition from the UK to stand trial for the murder of his wife Anni Dewani, 28, on their honeymoon in Cape Town

Shrien Dewani will be added as the fourth accused in the honeymoon murder of his bride Anni if he is extradited from Britain, a court heard today

Anni Dewani, 28, was travelling with her husband of just two weeks 
in a taxi through
an impoverished township just outside Cape Town when it was hijacked by two armed men.

Mr Dewani and the taxi driver were let go by the hijackers but Mrs Dewani was taken.

Police
claim that the gunmen, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, only 
carried out the hijack on the instructions of Shrien Dewani himself.

This,
the South African police claim, explains why both Mr Dewani and the taxi 
driver Zola Tongo were allowed out of the vehicle and only Mrs Dewani was taken.

She was later found dead from a gunshot to the neck in the abandoned car.

The
main evidence against the Bristol-based businessman appears to be the 
statement of taxi driver Zola Tongo who earned a seven year reduction in
his 25 year sentence for murder in return for making a statement about Mr Dewani's 
involvement.

Mr Dewani denies 
the accusations against him and his lawyers argue his life would be 
endangered if he were held in a South African jail and that Mr Dewani is 
too mentally unwell to stand trial in South Africa.

Last
April Mr Dewani was sectioned under the Mental Health Act to a 
psychiatric unit for his own protection, and in November he was 
sectioned again for a further six months following reports of a 
deterioration in his condition.

The
South African authorities have accused him of murder, conspiracy to 
commit murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and obstructing 
the administration of justice.

Mr Qwabe and Mr Mngeni are expected to appear in court again on 13 April.

Despite being in custody for 15 months, DNA nad blood samples have still not been taken from Xolile Mngeni, second right, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, centre, accused of Anni Dewani's murder

Cape Town High Court was full today with members of the public and press for the pre-trial hearing of South Africans Xolile Mngeni, left, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe,
