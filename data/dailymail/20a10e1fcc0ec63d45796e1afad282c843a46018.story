One of the two teenage hikers rescued last month after a five-day search of a Californian national park has been charged with felony methamphetamine possession.

Authorities found the drug in the vehicle belonging to 19-year-old Nicolas Cendoya while responding to his and 18-year-old Kyndall Jack's  disappearance.

The teenagers called investigators from Holy Jim Canyon on Easter Sunday, saying they were lost and their cellphone was dying.

Cendoya was discovered three days later, dehydrated and delirious. Jack was found the next day, hypothermic and confused.

Both recalled little from their ordeal, beyond hallucinations. Jack said that she had wild thoughts her 
parents had been sentenced to prison time, a python was eating her and 
that Cendoya, 19, had told her he was having visions of a tiger.

The search to find them required 1,900 man-hours and cost taxpayers an estimated $160,000. A deputy was injured while trying to rescue Cendoya. He faces up to three years in jail if convicted, reports The Orange County Register.

Jack was rescued shoeless and clinging 
to a mountain ledge on April 4 having suffered frostbite and cuts and 
bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her.

Kyndall Jack, one of two hikers lost for nearly a week in the Cleveland National Forest last month, revealed that they suffered from hallucinations during their ordeal

'I don't remember drinking anything,' said Jack to ABC News. 'I know I ate dirt. I tried to eat some dirt and rocks. I came to the hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that's all I remember.'

Describing her hallucinations, Jack said that the wilderness got to her, making her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion.

'My parents were in jail half the time, in my mind, and I was searching for my little sister, so that's all I remember,' said Jack.

'I was being eaten by a python. Like Nick saw a tiger, I was being eaten by a python half the time.'

Jack and Cendoya began their fateful 
trek on Easter Sunday in Trabuco Canyon in Southern Californian on what 
was their first date.

It was while at the top of a mountain that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they had exhausted the water supply.

'We wanted to touch the clouds,' said Jack. 'That's why we went up there. We wanted to be in the clouds at the top.'

And in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded, Cendoya sounds incoherent.

'We have fire I mean,' Cendoya told the 911 operator according to ABC News. 'I mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up. I don't know.'

The 911 operator can be heard to struggle with Cendoya as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost.

'Stop for one second. What is the address?' Cendoya can be overheard saying to Jack.

'I don't know,' she replies.

Jack told reporters that the battery on Cendoya's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the signal - and that is when they began to panic.

'I said just hold onto me. Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said Sunday after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.'

Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived.

Cendoya was found barefoot, shirtless and disorientated and Jack was found the next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat.

Following confusion over their accounts of how they became lost and separated, Cendoya said he was worried Kyndall Jack, 18, would blame him for what happened.

He said he had been told not to contact her and was concerned when she hadn't got in touch, but then she sent him a Facebook message insisting his words of encouragement when they got lost were 'what kept me going' and that she loved him and missed him.

'I heard a lot of really mean things 
that were being said about me... and when she was saved I hadn't heard 
from her and everyone was telling me not to call,' Cendoya told 
reporters outside Mission Viejo hospital. 'But then I get a (Facebook) 
post from Kyndall.'

Then he read out the heartfelt message.

'Hi Nick, all I think about is you. It's hard to make sense of it all and everything that has happened,' she wrote, before explaining how when she was rescued, she wasn't even aware that she had been hiking with him.

'Then I remember you telling me to calm down and that you were going to get me out of there and that's what kept me going,' she went on.

'Thank you so much and I love you and miss you more than words can describe. You are my hero Nicolas.'

Cendoya also described how he spent much of the ordeal in a dream-like state and even thought the search helicopters flying above him were hallucinations.

'The last thing I could tell you was going into a lucid dream,' he said. 'I can't even tell you when I woke up. I was in lucid dreams and hallucinations for days.'

He said that while he was wandering in the arid surrounds, he reflected on what he considered recent selfish behaviors, like focusing too much on himself and not enough on his family.

'So that's why when all this happened, I didn't cry, I didn't fear it. I just embraced everything. I said, "This is what I deserve,"' Cendoya said. 'I just knew I would get through it. I knew this wasn't my time to die. I knew that I needed this, to become the person that I'm supposed to be.'

The two teen hikers were just a couple of miles from a shopping mall, and were able to make out the Los Angeles skyline and hear the rumbles of downtown traffic from where they wandered off trail.

And although the sprawling expanse of Southern California suburbia is clearly visible from the forest's ridgelines, in the canyon where they were trapped the brush was so thick they couldn't find a road that was just 500 feet away.
