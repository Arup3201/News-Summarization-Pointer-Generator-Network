Tributes continue to flow for the two Australians killed when Germanwings flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and crashed into a remote region of the French Alps.

Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday. 

New photos of the 29-year-old have emerged, showing him as a political activist who campaigned for equality.

Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, enroute from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight

Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering

A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart'

Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial to a caring young man, with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues.

Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 

'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.'

Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others.

Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit.

'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said. 

The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer.

'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott both offered their condolences to the family of the two Australian victims

Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English.

Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering.  

'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said.

'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' 

His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled.

'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said.

'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights.

'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.'

The news came as the first pictures of some of those lost emerged - and search teams recovered the black box from the crash site, where wreckage, bodies and personal belongings were strewn across a large area on the mountainside.

'I don't think it gets any easier announcing the death of Australian citizens in a tragedy overseas,' Ms Bishop said.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this shocking tragedy. We extend our condolences to the governments of Germany, France and Spain and their people who appear to have borne the brunt of this tragedy.' 

Ms Bishop's prayers were echoed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. 

'This incident will be a very painful reminder of other disasters in recent times - whether it's MH370 or MH17 - this will be a very raw moment for many Victorian families who have had to live through those tragedies just in the space of the last 12 months,' Mr Andrews said.
