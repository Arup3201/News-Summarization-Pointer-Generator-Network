His name only seems to float into the wider consciousness every four years and, right on cue, Germany's Miroslav Klose is making the headlines once again.

The veteran 35-year-old has been named as the only out-and-out striker in Joachim Low's squad for the World Cup, giving him the opportunity to make a nice bit of history out in Brazil.

He needs two more goals to overtake Brazilian legend Ronaldo and become the record all-time goalscorer in World Cup tournaments.

Here we go again: 35-year-old Miroslav Klose has been selected as Germany's only out-and-out striker for the World Cup finals in Brazil

Chosen one: Coach Joachim Low (left) picked his final 23 names for the finals in Brazil on Monday and included Klose for his seventh major tournament

Goalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Roman Weidenfeller (Borussia Dortmund), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hanover 96)

Defenders: Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich), Kevin Grosskreutz (Borussia Dortmund), Erik Durm (Borussia Dortmund), Benedikt Hoewedes (Schalke 04), Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund), Per Mertesacker (Arsenal), Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich)

Midfielders: Julian Draxler (Schalke 04), Matthias Ginter (Freiburg), Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich), Christoph Kramer (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Sami Khedira (Real Madrid), Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Mesut Ozil (Arsenal), Lukas Podolski (Arsenal), Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund), Andre Schuerrle (Chelsea), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich)

Forward: Miroslav Klose (Lazio)

And Ronaldo magnanimously said he would be happy for Klose if he stole the honour in his own backyard.

'I am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken,' Ronaldo said. 'It would be nice to keep it for a while longer but I am cheering for someone to break the record. It will be good for the sport.'

Ronaldo's record is 15 goals in 19 appearances at the World Cup finals. Klose's stands at 14 in the same number of matches.

If Germany reach the latter stages, Klose will be 36 and, despite his incredible longevity, it's a safe bet to say he won't get another chance to claim the record.

He is also currently tied with Gerd Muller on 68 as the German team's all-time leading scorer and so could claim a double if he finds the net.

Record to beat: Klose has a chance to overhaul Ronaldo's record of 15 goals in World Cup tournaments

Top of the charts: Klose also needs one more goal to overtake Gerd Muller's all-time record of 68 goals for the Germany national team

1 Ronaldo (Brazil) - 15 goals in 19 games2 Gerd Muller (West Germany) - 14 in 13= Miroslav Klose (Germany) - 14 in 194 Just Fontaine (France) - 13 in 65 Pele (Brazil) - 12 in 146 Sandor Kocsis (Hungary) - 11 in 5= Jurgen Klinsmann (Germany) 11 in 17

Given the wealth of attacking midfield talent at his disposal, Low decided it wasn't necessary to take Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland alongside Klose as he named his chosen 23 on Monday.

Klose scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Lazio last season, half the haul of his previous campaign. Volland managed 11 goals and nine assists for Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga but the 21-year-old will undoubtedly get his chance in the future.

Klose's international record is beyond question, however, spanning 13 years, seven major tournaments, three managers and a good few strike partners.

It was Rudi Voller who handed him his debut back in March 2001, rewarded by Klose's first goal as Albania were beaten 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier.

Many will remember the hat-trick he scored in Germany's 8-0 demolition of Saudi Arabia under the Sapporo Dome at the 2002 finals, followed up by strikes in the other group matches against the Republic of Ireland and Cameroon.

Head over heels: Klose celebrates his World Cup goal against Cameroon back in 2002 in customary fashion

All the goals were headers and his front-flip celebration became something of a trademark as Germany finished runners-up to Brazil out in the Far East.

On his way back from a knee injury, Klose wasn't fully fit at Euro 2004 and Germany bombed out in the group stages.

Decent form in the friendlies leading up to the 2006 World Cup gave Klose, who at that time played for Werder Bremen, a chance to make amends for 2002 on home territory.

He duly scored twice in the opener against Costa Rica, two more against Ecuador and a crucial late equaliser against Argentina in the quarter-finals - enough to carry home the Golden Boot - but Germany suffered heartbreak in the classic semi-final with Italy.

Klose's good form after making a £12m move to Bayern Munich made him a cert for Low's Euro 2008 squad and he boosted his tournament goals tally by scoring against Portugal in the last eight and Turkey in the last four.

But for the second time in his career, there would be disappointment in a major final as Spain beat them 1-0.

Seven goals in qualifying helped Germany to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa and Klose again saved his best for the knockout stages, scoring the first in the 4-1 win over England and a double in the 4-0 rout of Argentina.

Klose moved from Bayern to Lazio midway through the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, but it didn't halt his regular goalscoring form as nine goals earned Die Mannschaft their spot in Poland and Ukraine.

A goal against Greece in the quarter-finals was all Klose had to show from the tournament itself as Germany again came up short in the semi-finals.

But with plenty still in the tank, Klose again spearheaded Germany's attack through another qualification campaign and, entering his seventh finals tournament, earned himself the chance to write himself permanently into the record books as he pens the final chapter of a long and successful career chock full of goals.
