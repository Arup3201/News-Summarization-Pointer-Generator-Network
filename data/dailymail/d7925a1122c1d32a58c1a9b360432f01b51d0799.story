Luke Shaw admits his performances since joining Manchester United have not yet justified his price tag but vows: ‘You’ll see my best soon.’

The England Under 21 left back endured a difficult night in the 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion, only his third club match following his £31million move from Southampton having picked up a hamstring injury and had questions raised over his fitness.

The result leaves United 10 points behind Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday and are seen by many as champions-elect. But Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion.

Luke Shaw admits his performances have not lived up to his £31million price tag at Manchester United

‘No not yet. It’s a long season so we’ll have to see what happens,’ he said. ‘We’re going to work hard this week and be ready for the challenge on Sunday. It’s a massive test. They’re flying at the moment.’

On his own form Shaw provided a commendably honest appraisal, having received some criticism over his defensive credentials. He was partly at fault for Stephane Sessegnon’s opening goal at The Hawthorns by getting drawn too central trying to win the ball.

Shaw, 19, said: ‘I know I haven’t been up to my full potential and I think maybe people can see that at the moment. They haven’t seen the best of me yet.

‘I am trying hard and it’s about getting used to everything. When you come to a club like this it’s never easy for a young player like me. But I’ll get myself starting soon and put in good performances.

‘I wouldn’t say I’ve been horrendous but I know I can do much better. And I need to do better. I’ve come to Manchester United and I know what they need. I’ve been working hard and the performances will come.’

Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title

Shaw, who broke into the Southampton first team two years ago, was told by Louis van Gaal to improve his fitness during pre-season. Roy Hodgson also voiced his concerns.

He had to wait for his debut until West Ham visited Old Trafford last month, and was withdrawn in his next match against Everton as a precaution over a knee complaint.

But during the international break he played 180 minutes as England Under 21s beat Croatia over two legs to progress to Euro 2015 and that action provided a psychological and physical boost.

‘It always helps and the main thing for me was it was two 90 minutes for fitness,’ he said. ‘I feel fit but like I said I haven’t played my best recently. That’s football. Hopefully I’ll come out of it now. I think I could still get a bit fitter from working hard in training. But I do feel pretty fit in training.’

At The Hawthorns, Van Gaal set up United in a third different formation of the season, having started with a 5-3-2 system before switching to a midfield diamond.

Against West Brom it looked more 4-1-4-1 with Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj hugging the wings. Shaw described the formation as 4-3-3 and insisted it relatively straight-forward to adjust tactics.

‘It’s not too difficult, we had a few days to work on it,’ he said. ‘We did a lot of work based on the 4-3-3 formation with wide wingers.

‘We knew what we had to do against West Brom but unfortunately we didn’t get the result. It’s definitely two points lost, we’re Man United, we come to win every game.

‘It’s two points lost because we were positive ahead of the game. They only had two shots on target (but scored twice) and that’s not good enough for us. We’ll focus hard this week and be ready for the game on Sunday.’
