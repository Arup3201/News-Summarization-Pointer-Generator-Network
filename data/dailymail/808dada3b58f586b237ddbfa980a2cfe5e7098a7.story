Lee Mason could be forgiven for taking next Christmas off after yet another festive refereeing row.

A week after upsetting Aston Villa by showing Gabby Agbonlahor a red card that was later overturned, the Greater Manchester referee was again under fire after this bruising encounter at Goodison Park.

Everton were furious that Mason only booked Jonathan Walters for dragging back Leighton Baines when he was clear on goal moments before awarding Stoke a decisive penalty when Bojan Krkic went down under considerably less contact from James McCarthy.

The little Spaniard took it himself and beat Tim Howard convincingly despite being targeted by a laser pen in the crowd, crowning a classy performance amid the driving rain and thundering challenges.

It was the second Boxing Day in a row that Mason has been involved in controversy. Last year, Brendan Rodgers was fined £8,000 for criticising him following Liverpool’s costly defeat at Manchester City.

Bojan went off with a back injury midway through the second half but, according to Stoke manager Mark Hughes, he had already answered any questions about his ability to perform in such testing conditions.

‘If people see any weakness in Bojan’s play, they say he’s not quite right for the English game,’ said Hughes. ‘I think he’s knocked those thoughts on the head.’

Everton, though, were furious over Mason’s decisions. The 43-year-old official certainly had his hands full on Friday. He had to add 10 minutes of injury-time in a first half that left with Stoke skipper Ryan Shawcross with a heavily bandaged head and Everton’s Ross Barkley with a bloodied nose. Indeed, at times it felt as though these two teams were taking Boxing Day a little too literally.

Shawcross was injured after an early collision with Romelu Lukaku who, to be fair, had his eyes on the ball when they were involved in a clash of heads which inflicted a nasty cut over his opponent’s right eye that required stitches at half-time.

John Stones was the next player to need treatment after a crunching tackle by Glenn Whelan which allowed Bojan to set Mame Diouf free on goal, but Phil Jagielka got back to make an excellent block.

Jagielka was injured shortly afterwards when he stumbled over Walters, and by then Barkley was making regular trips to the touchline for running repairs on his nose injury. At one point the two team-mates were stood side by side next to the dug-out with the home side temporarily reduced to nine men.

Everton’s response was robust. Marko Arnautovic needed treatment on his right ankle following a crunching challenge by Gareth Barry, and Steven Naismith was cautioned for a late tackle on Bojan. When Barry followed him into Mason’s notebook in the second half, he became the first player to reach a century of yellow cards in the Premier League.

Then came the turning point. Walters escaped with a yellow for grabbing hold of Baines as he moved on to Barry’s through ball, and soon after Bojan outpaced McCarthy down the left flank and just kept the ball in play.

You have to wonder if the Everton midfielder’s lack of match fitness after a month out played a part, as Bojan wriggled past him and then went down under the slightest of touches.

Up to that point, Everton’s best chance had fallen to Barry, who could not direct Kevin Mirallas’s corner into an empty net at the far post after the Belgian’s shot had been deflected inches wide. 

But they twice went close to equalising at the end of the first half. Asmir Begovic came out to punch a corner from Baines and Naismith’s follow-up header was nodded off the line by Steven N’zonzi. Then Naismith set up Mirallas, who had time to draw Begovic out of his goal before sliding a shot wide of the near post.

Jagielka’s ankle injury meant he did not appear for the second half and neither did Howard, a calf strain bringing Joel Robles off the bench to replace him in Everton’s goal.

The Spanish keeper had little to do except try to keep warm in the driving rain as Everton dominated the second half. Stoke were happy to drop deep and protect their lead, with N’zonzi particularly impressive in securing a valuable win.

‘In the second half we expected Everton to come back,’ said Hughes. ‘But I don’t think they gained any real momentum to ask any questions of us, and I thought we saw it out quite comfortably.’
