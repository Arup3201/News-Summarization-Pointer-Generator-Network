Joe Hart has revealed the image he will use for inspiration if faced with having to save a penalty at the World Cup in Brazil.

England's No 1 will picture David Seaman's penalty stop to deny Scotland's Gary McAllister during Euro 96 at Wembley if called upon this summer.

All smiles: England goalkeeper Joe Hart will use David Seaman's Euro 96 penalty save as inspiration in Brazil

'I wan't to have my own David Seaman moment which England fans will always remember,' Hart told the Sun.

'For David, it was his famous penalty save to deny Gary McAllister at Wembley during Euro 96.'

The
 27-year-old Man City stopper claims that particular game, a match also 
famous for Paul Gascoigne's exquisite volley which helped the Three 
Lions to a 2-0 victory, is his first memory of following England.

'That was my first memory of supporting England, the first time I really connected with the the national team.

'David
 Seaman's save was an inspirational moment and remains my first big 
football memory - although his psychedelic top might have had something 
to do with that.'
