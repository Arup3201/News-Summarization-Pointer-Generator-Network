Luke Shaw admitted he has struggled to cope with the demands of playing for Manchester United after he returned to the team against Chelsea.

Shaw has started seeing a psychologist in recent weeks as he comes to terms with his £28million move from Southampton to Old Trafford in the summer.

The left back, who had a decent game on his return to the team at Stamford Bridge, said: 'I am still young and coming to the biggest club in the world hasn't been easy for me.

'I wouldn't say it has been a hard three weeks but it has been a three weeks that I have been able to learn a lot more about myself, so it has been a nice three weeks in that respect and good to get on the pitch again.'

Shaw claims he had a minor back injury when he was substituted at half-time against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Old Trafford last month, but he was left out of the team by Louis van Gaal for the next four games. Shaw added: 'He has two sides to him, but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager.

'You have seen what he has turned United into in recent weeks but that is because there is a really focused side, where you have to give 100 per cent in every training session and game and be focused all the time.

'If you don't give that, he won't play you and that's what he is like.'

The 19-year-old has played 19 times in all competitions for United this campaign, after featuring in twice as many matches for Southampton last season.

'I haven't been playing and there have been a lot of negative comments about me,' he said. 'It is something that isn't nice and I've tried to ignore it but hopefully this is the start of me coming back.

'I saw a comment the other day saying I was taken off at half-time against Arsenal because I wasn't fit enough, but that's not true at all.

'This is coming from me and I know what the manager pulled me off for and it was not for my fitness because I could have carried on in the game.'

Mauricio Pochettino brought the best out of Shaw at St Mary's last season, and there was a real sense of paternal warmth between manager and player.

Despite his up-and-down start at Old Trafford, Shaw insists he has the full support of Van Gaal. 'Over the last three weeks I have learned a lot from the manager and credit goes to him for trusting me in a big game like this,' said Shaw.

'I have family and friends who are helping me on my journey and the manager has been unbelievable as well.'
