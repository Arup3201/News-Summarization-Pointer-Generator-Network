The number of men having breast reduction surgery on the NHS has over doubled since 2009, new figures reveal.

Cruelly dubbed ''moobs' - or man boobs - 200 men in the last five years have been so distressed by their chests that they have undergone operations on the NHS to reduce their size, according to data which emerged during a response to a parliamentary question. 

Between 2009 and 2010 only 18 operations were performed on the NHS but by 2013 to 2014 the number had risen to 39. Many more procedures are believed to have been carried out privately.  

The number of male breast reductions performed on the NHS has doubled since 2009 

Speaking to FEMAIL, consultant plastic surgeon at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, Kevin Handcock, explains that moobs, which are technically called gynaecomastia, can occur for two reasons.

'The two types are known as 'true gynaecomastia' and 'false gynaecomastia'.

'True gynaecomastia is when a man actually develops breast tissue, and usually presents in teenagers and young adults. Occasionally it can also occur later in life as a side-effect of drugs for various conditions.

'Where as in false gynaecomastia, no real breast tissue has developed and the appearance of breasts is purely down to fat.'

It is easy then, with the knowledge that the UK obesity crisis continues to get worse, to assume the rise in the number of 'moob' reductions is purely due to more overweight men developing fatty chests.

Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum told FEMAIL: 'Obesity is starting to get out of control in the UK.

Though men still only account for one in ten plastic surgery patients, figures are rising 

'This sort of thing will only increase in the future. We will see increase in treatments of many of the other conditions associated with obesity. It is something that specialists in this area are extremely worried about.'

However,  consultant plastic surgeon Kevin Handcock says this might not be the only reason for the increase.

'People are becoming more aware that there is treatment available for this,' he explains.

'Men who in the past would have suffered in silence, hiding under baggy T-shirts now feel able to come forward and do something about it.'

Now that there is less stigma attached to men having cosmetic surgery, it seems we might begin to see numbers of all procedures rise, although men still only account for one in ten cosmetic procedures according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.
