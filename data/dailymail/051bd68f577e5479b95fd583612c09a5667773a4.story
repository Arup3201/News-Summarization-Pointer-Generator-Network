Uber car service celebrated National Cat Day by delivering kittens to the doorsteps of customers in seven cities across American on Wednesday.

Customers paid $30 to snuggle with the adoptable felines at their homes and offices for 15 minutes with all proceeds going to participating offices.

The uber cute kitties showed up in offices and homes in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin, Washington DC, Seattle and Phoenix.

Loves to cuddle: Uber delivered kittens for 15 minute cuddle sessions in cities across America on Wednesday and one of the participating celebrities was model Coco Rocha

Popular promo: Offices like social marketing firm Spredfast in Austin, Texas jumped on the Uber Kitten bandwagon

Social media perfect storm: Twitter and Facebook lit up with posts tagged #Uberkittens along with photos of the visiting furballs on Wednesday

According to the Uber blog, local shelters worked with customers who wanted more than just their 15 minutes and hoped to adopt their kittens.

As the company predicted, the deal was too good to pass up as there were more customers than kittens in many of the participating areas. 

Photos of the snuggle sessions showed up on social media posts out of all six cities, where #uberkittens appeared to be especially popular among office workers eager for a break from routine.

In New York, the kittens showed up in the offices of publishers Condé Nast and Hearst.

At Condé Nast, one of the kittens was seen staring at a blown up magazine cover featuring actress Jennifer Lawrence. 

'Catness meets Katniss at @VanityFair' tweeted the ASPCA.

Celebrities also loved the event. Canadian model Coco Rocha seemed especially smitten.

'PURE GENIUS,' the 26-year-old tweeted along with a picture of her holding a grey kitten. '@ASPCA & @Uber teamed up to bring you adoptable kittens on demand.' 

This was the second year of Uber's promotion and was available in twice as many cities this time around.

Last October, only cat lovers in Seattle, New York and San Francisco could participate.

Animal rights advocacy group PETA's Senior Vice President of Cruelty Investigations Daphna Nachminovitch told MailOnline in an email:

'A kitten isn't for 15 minutes but for life, so hopefully, these interludes will lead to a real home for a real cat for the rest of his or her life. PETA urges careful screening of all adopters, just as should occur with the adoption of a human child.'

Uber's blog refers potential adopters back to their participatng local shelters, where the policies on screening adopters differ.

At Chicago's Anti-cruelty Society, for instance, adopters are urged to spend as much time as possible with the pet before making the decision to apply to take it home.

At the San Francisco SPCA, meanwhile, potential pet parents are required to attend a training class before they are sent home with a pet.
