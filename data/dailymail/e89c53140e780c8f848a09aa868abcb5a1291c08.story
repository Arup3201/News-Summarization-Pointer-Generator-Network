Four army bases are to be closed and another three scaled back in major shake-up of forces sites which will save £240million-a-year.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted the move would sever ‘historic ties’ between local communities and the army.

But he defied a Cabinet warning from Treasury minister Danny Alexander that ministers must not 'air dirty laundry' over cuts in public, by again speaking out against further reductions in the Ministry of Defence budget.

Cuts: Four army bases are to be axed, including Howe Barracks in Canterbury, Kent where the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion were stationed

Under the plans announced today, all British troops are to be returned from Germany a year earlier than planned, with them based at Salisbury Plain, Edinburgh and Leuchars, Catterick, Aldershot, Colchester, Stafford and the East Midlands.

But barracks in North Yorkshire, Canterbury, Edinburgh and Pembrokeshire will be axed as a result of a dramatic cut in the number size of the army.

‘The local communities in each of these areas have been hugely supportive of the military presence over many years,’ Mr Hammond told MPs.

He said it was a plan ‘that is driven by the army's requirement to generate military capability in the most effective and efficient way as it reconfigures for contingent operations, based almost entirely in the UK’.

Mr Hammond added: 'By setting out our plans to bring troops back to the UK we are not only providing our service personnel and their families with greater stability for their future, but also generating a saving of around £240 million a year in operational running costs.

'We are going to invest an additional £1.8 billion in our new basing plan, providing investment around the country, crucial jobs for local economies and the best possible accommodation for our soldiers and their families.

'This work also supports and enables the Army 2020 structure, announced last year, which will ensure that the British Army remains the most capable Army in its class, adaptable and ready to meet the security challenges of the next decade and beyond.'

Closures: The cost-cutting plan will see the end of Claro Barracks, Ripon, North Yorkshire; Howe Barracks, Canterbury; Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh; and Cawdor Barracks in Brawdy, Pembrokeshire. 
Parts of Redford Barracks, Edinburgh; Forthside Barracks, Stirling; and Copthorne Barracks, Shrewsbury will also be cut back

The bases which will be axed are: Claro Barracks, Ripon, North Yorkshire; Howe Barracks, Canterbury; Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh and Cawdor Barracks in Brawdy, Pembrokeshire.

Parts of Redford Barracks, Edinburgh; Forthside Barracks, Stirling; and Copthorne Barracks, Shrewsbury will also be cut back.

Around 11,000 British troops based in Germany will return home by 2016 under plans which will see nearly £2 billion invested in Army housing and bases. It is equibalent to 70 per cent of the total and ahead of the plan to have half out by that date.

The remaining 4,500 troops will be back in the UK by 2019, a year earlier than planned.

Around £1 billion of the funding being announced today will be go towards 1,900 new houses for service families and accommodation for 7,800 single soldiers. Another £800 million will be spent on infrastructure and refurbishment of bases.

However Mr Hammond used the announcement to launch another defence of his department's budget, despite warnings hours earlier that ministers should stop publicly scrapping over funding.

At this morning's session of Cabinet, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told ministers to stop airing 'dirty laundry' in public.

The senior Lib Dem said that this was 'no way to do business', adding: 'I would like to say it is really important that we do work together and that conversations between ministers are private. We should not air our dirty laundry in public.'

But hours later Mr Hammond told reporters at a press conference: 'We have some challenging efficiencies which we are driving through now, including in the front line commands.

'I have never said, and I would never say, that there are not further efficiencies that we can take and we are working right now to identify where we mighty find still further efficiencies across the defence budget.

'But really, if we go beyond what can be delivered from efficiency, there will have to be a reassessment of the output that is delivered.'
