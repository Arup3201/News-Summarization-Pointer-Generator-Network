Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has decided to go against the grain by suggesting neither Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi should not win this year's Ballon d'Or.

Van Gaal instead believes one of the six Germany players nominated should take the prestigious award due to their World Cup triumph in the summer.

The Dutchman, who himself has been named on the FIFA World Coach of the Year award, told Manchester United's official website: 'Most of the time it is always the well known players [who win the Ballon d'Or].

'I don't think you can compare players in different positions.

'It is more for the football world and outside world than for other things I believe. I think it will be Ronaldo or Messi but I want to say that you have to win something.

'And the best thing to win is the World Cup so I hope it will be a German player because they deserve it.

'In Germany, the level of the Bundesliga matches is also very high so I think it should be a German player.'

Six of Germany's World Cup-winning squad are in contention to win the award with Mario Gotze, Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm, Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer and Bastian Schweinsteiger all included on the 23-man shortlist.
