Two young boys killed after a rockslide poured over them during a school field trip to a Minnesota park have been pictured following the tragic recovery of the final boy's body on Thursday.

Ten-year-old Zack Mohamed Fofana, a fourth grader visiting Lilydale Regional Park in St Paul on Wednesday, was recovered one day after being buried in the horrific landslide to the heartbreak of family who never lost hope he was still alive.

Haysem Sani, a 9-year-old classmate of Fofan's at Peter Hobart Elementary School, also died on Wednesday after he and two others were initially rushed to a hospital for their injuries, KSTP reports.

The rain-saturated gravel swept over 
the group of children in the St. Louis 
Park burying one to the waist and another entirely, Fire Marshal Steve
Zaccard said.

St. Paul Assistant Fire Chief Jim 
Smith told reporters that crews found the body of the 10-year-old late in the morning after
they came up with a plan for resuming the search safely.

Police and firefighters dug frantically with shovels and their hands to get to the children.

One child with minor injuries was 
treated and released, and the other child remained in serious condition 
Thursday, Fire Marshal Steve Zaccard said.

The search resumed around 11am on Thursday as the boy's father and uncle stood nearby hoping for a miracle.

The boy's uncle, Mohamed Bah, told the Star Tribune while standing near the site that's known for its fossils that his nephew 'liked geology.'

His father said his little boy was so excited about the field trip that day.

'He came to me and said, "You know we have a field trip tomorrow? I'm so happy,"' his father Lancine Fofana told the Pioneer Press on Thursday.

Bah told reporters at the scene that he hadn't lost hope in seeing his nephew alive again.

Still, he said, 'We believe that 
everything happens the way God wants it to happen ... Whatever the 
outcome may be, we accept it.'

Lilydale Regional Park is a popular destination for school field trips because of the numerous fossils embedded in that part of the Mississippi River bluffs.

Partly for safety reasons, the city requires permits for fossil-hunting at the park, and requires applicants to sign a waiver releasing the city from any liability for injuries or property damage.

The park department's permit web site and the application form both specifically state that 'some of the conditions and locations within the Lilydale Regional Park area are hazardous to persons or property' and that park users must assume liability for any injuries or claims that might arise 'due to its unsafe conditions.'

On Wednesday night search crews 
proceeded cautiously through the gravel and light rain in a hunt that 
was described as a recovery effort.

Unthinkable: One child, a 9-year-old boy, was killed by gravel loosened from rain while he searched for fossils with classmates in St. Paul, Minnesota

Crews worked to make the scene safer, using fire hoses to wash away loose dirt before it could fall on searchers.

Digging had stopped earlier, and crews were setting up lights and preparing to search into the night,  Zaccard said.

‘Obviously we have a very tragic 
situation here today,’ Mayor Chris Coleman said at a news conference 
hours after the gravel slide.

Police
and firefighters dug frantically with shovels and their hands to get to
the children, Zaccard said. He estimated it took an hour to rescue a 
child buried to the waist, and another half-hour to reach the buried 
child as more workers and equipment were moved in.

As
news of the gravel slide broke, parents gathered at the school, located
in a western Minneapolis suburb several miles away, to await their 
children.

Zaccard said several days of rain had 
softened the ground at the park, but it and nearby Cherokee Park were 
open and available to the public Wednesday. Brad Meyer, the city's parks
and recreation spokesman, said it's rare to close a park ‘unless there 
is a major hazardous condition.’

Fears: Parents and their children leave the Peter Hobart Elementary School in St. Louis Park after the tragedy

‘We didn't have any indication that we should close the park or that it was unsafe,’ Meyer said.

The
area is popular for school field trips because students can hunt for 
fossils in the soft sandstone cliffs, said Michael Rutzick, who was at 
the park Wednesday and lives in nearby Mendota Heights.

‘It's all sandstone. Sandstone and trees,’ Rutzick said.

Tammy Olson, who lives two blocks away, was at the scene with her two young nephews Wednesday. She said she never considered the park dangerous.

‘I've been here six years, and my husband has been here 23. He said there's never been an issue with accidents down there,’ Olson said.

A firefighter also was injured by a falling rock but was expected to recover, Zaccard said. Another firefighter suffered a back injury, and both firefighters were back home, the fire department tweeted.
