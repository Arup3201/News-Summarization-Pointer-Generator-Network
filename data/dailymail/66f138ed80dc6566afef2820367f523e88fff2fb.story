The stepdaughter of a puppy breeder accused of shooting dead her mother, sister and four dogs on his farm shouted, ‘Why, why? I love you,’ as he appeared in court for the first time today.

John Lowe, 82, appeared confused as he stood in the dock and was accused of murdering the two women last Sunday at his farm in the village of Tilford near Farnham, Surrey.

The outburst was made by his stepdaughter, Stacy Banner, 38, who had travelled to the court to see him appear before magistrates.

The bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home

Lowe was helped into the dock at Guildford Magistrates' Court by security guards to face the double murder allegations.

He was accused of killing Christine Lee, 66, and her 40-year-old daughter, Lucy.

Their bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home.

Lowe was also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

During a brief and emotionally-charged, hearing, Lowe spoke to confirm his details. He struggled to hear what was being said, telling the court: ‘I'm a little bit deaf.’

Scene: Police called to a house outside Farnham, Surrey, found the bodies of two women and four dogs

The clerk said to magistrates: ‘I will ask you to send him to the Crown Court.

‘This court is unable to make a determination in relation to bail because you don't have jurisdiction.’

Richard Sawle, presiding magistrate, told the defendant: ‘We are sending you to the crown court today where you will appear before Judge Critchlow.’

Lowe was then led back to the cells before making the 50 yard journey to the higher court.

Following the discovery, Mrs Banner said her whole family had been ‘wiped out’ as detectives questioned Lowe about the bloodshed.

Her mother was found dead inside the dilapidated farmhouse, while her sister, Lucy, had been shot dead outside in a muddy yard.

Both the dead women had been shot with a long-barrelled shotgun and were pronounced dead at the scene.

Surrey Police confirmed the identities of Christine and Lucy Lee and said post-mortem examinations showed they died from gunshot wounds.

'I have lost everyone - my mum, sister…. This is a nightmare,' Mrs Banner told The Sun’s James Beal.

'I just can't get my head around what's happened. My family's gone and I'm absolutely devastated.

'I'm utterly heartbroken - we've been left in pieces.

'I just want to wake up and be told it's a dream. My mum and sister must have been so scared.'

A marked police van guarded the gates at the end of the drive of the detached house when they were called

A few yards away from the bodies, in a 
filthy kennel, police found a German shepherd that had been shot dead, 
while two other German shepherds and a labrador were also found dead 
nearby.Lowe was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston said the suspect was uninjured and remained calm when officers attended the house.

Detectives
 from Surrey Police are investigating whether one of the guns recovered 
at the scene was one they returned to Lowe last summer.

Surrey Police
 had had previous contact with parties involved in this incident and has
 referred a past contact to the IPCC, a spokesman said.

'In May 2013 a
 shotgun licence and a number of licensed shotguns were seized from the 
address however the licence and guns were returned in July 2013.

'We are in the process of establishing if one of these licensed guns was the firearm recovered on Sunday'.

An
 IPCC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have received a referral from 
Surrey Police and are considering what our involvement should be.'

The women's bodies bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home

Animal welfare officers were called to rescue animals living in at the property, Keeper’s Cottage Stud, after Sunday’s shooting.

In
 all, 14 dogs were taken away, including nine kept in filthy, crumbling,
 outdoor pens. Six horses were also found at the property where Mr Lowe 
lived alone following his partner’s death last year. Two in extremely poor condition were rescued from a yard covered in pools of liquid manure and strewn with rotting hay.

The other four emaciated animals remained in a stable with its roof hanging off. They were caked in mud.

Among scrap metal and tumble-down outbuildings, a dovecote could be seen where Lowe is said to have kept birds. 

It emerged that officials had regularly visited Keeper’s Cottage Stud over concerns at the conditions in which animals lived.

Lowe was also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life

Surrey Police and the RSPCA were called in last July over concerns about breeding at the farm, when 50 dogs were found.

RSPCA
 inspector Rob Jackson said last night: ‘I came to Mr Lowe’s property 
about six months ago responding to a complaint about the welfare of dogs
 at the farm.

‘I will not discuss that visit but previously he has 
bred a number of different breeds – beagles, labradoodles and German 
shepherds.’

An online petition set up last year calling on the RSPCA to close the puppy farm attracted 1,300 signatures.

Lowe
 denied wrongdoing at the time, saying: ‘There are no puppies here. The 
only dogs here are my four guard dogs. I have never heard of this 
petition and the things said on it are absolute rubbish.’

Neighbours
 described the suspect as a recluse. ‘The RSPCA was always up there and 
no sooner had they shut him down than he would spring back into 
business. They just couldn’t stop him,’ said one man, who declined to be
 named.
