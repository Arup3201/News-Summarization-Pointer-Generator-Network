Departure: Candy Crowley, the chief political correspondent and State of the Union host will leave CNN after 27 years

CNN's chief political correspondent and State of the Union host Candy Crowley is leaving the network after 27 years.

The 65-year-old confirmed that she will leave her job at the end of the month.

Her final appearance as host of State of the Union will be on December 21.

CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker heaped praise on the veteran correspondent and called her one of the most 'important and impactful journalists on air.'

He told staff at CNN in an e-mail: 'Crowley has made the decision to move on, so she can embark on the next chapter of her already prolific career. 

'As difficult as it is for us to imagine CNN without Candy, we know that she comes to this decision thoughtfully, and she has our full support.' 

Crowley said she doesn't yet know her next stop, but wants the 'chance to do something new, somewhere new.'

She joined CNN in 1987 and covered presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections as well as legislative developments on Capitol Hill.

In 2012, she took center stage and moderated the heated presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

Before joining CNN, Crowley worked as an anchor for the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network.

She was also a general assignment and White House correspondent for The Associated Press, before moving to NBC News' Washington bureau.

Zucker added: 'To say she lives and breathes politics is more than an understatement.

'She has an innate ability to sense its nuance, push its limits, and ask questions that others won't.'

'She is beloved in Washington even by those that she so skillfully takes to task on Sunday mornings. 

'And she's an award-winning journalist -- taking home everything from a Peabody and Emmys to an Edward R. Murrow award. She is a television news icon.'

Crowley will celebrate her 66th birthday the day after Christmas.

Career: Before joining CNN, she worked as an anchor for the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network, AP, and NBC
