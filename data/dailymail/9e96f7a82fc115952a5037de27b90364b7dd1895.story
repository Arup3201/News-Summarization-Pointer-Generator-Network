Fervent Manchester United fan and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has issued a decree ordering state television to broadcast Premier League football.

It is believed English football matches, featuring star-studded teams 
such as Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool will soon be 
broadcast across the nation following his decision.

The young leader is a long-time supporter of Manchester United and striker Wayne Rooney.

And it is his passion for the Red Devils and English top flight football that reportedly paved the way for football to be included in the country's viewing schedule shake-up.

However, it will also be illegal. Football clubs sell their video rights to broadcasters in deals that provide huge revenue and this is one way the league remains exceptionally lucrative.

A Premier League spokesman told the Daily Star: 'Nobody has the rights to broadcast Premier League football in North Korea so if this is happening then it is copyright theft, plain and simple.'

The 31-year-old assumed power in the repressed state following his father Kim Jong-Il's death in 2011 and has been quick to continue his father's legacy of total power.

His father's poor human rights record has also continued, with defectors and dissidents killed, disappeared or sent to working camps.

Living conditions in the country - which is shrouded in mystery and closed to communication with the outside world - are thought to be dire.

Reports of famine, cannibalism, exceptionally poor rates of income and political repression have emerged from the area for years.Â
