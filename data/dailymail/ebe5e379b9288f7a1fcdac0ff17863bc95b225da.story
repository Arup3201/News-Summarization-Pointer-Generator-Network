As a father of two young boys the one thing I dread is the infuriating battle of wills that breaks out whenever it is time to put on their coats and shoes to leave the house. 

So, when my wife suggested our first family skiing holiday the idea of kitting them out each morning in stubborn skiing boots, uncomfortable helmets, and easily lost gloves, goggles and lift passes made me develop a sudden enthusiasm for staying put in London and visiting lots of museums.

I was overruled, of course, and so we headed for the French Alps.

I was looking forward to saying 'I told you so' as the boys struggled at the equipment hire shop. 

My wife, Elizabeth, who is a much more experienced skier than me, was wondering what all the fuss was about.

Thankfully I was proved wrong.The local ski hire staff were both thoughtful and slick and Thomas, nine, and his seven year-old brother Jack were measured up and fully equipped along with a dozen other British children with astonishing speed and ease. 

Our boys were waiting by the hire shop door eager to get on with the holiday frustrated only by their dad who was still struggling to get his boots on.

We were staying at Esprit Ski's flagship four-star Chalet Hotel Les Deux Domaines in the charming resort of Belle Plagne.

This village sized, family-friendly destination benefits from the extensive facilities of the La Plagne resort of which it is a part, but is more relaxed and charming than some of the other more sprawling resort towns.

It is an ideal base from which to explore Paradiski, the linked areas of La Plagne and Les Arcs, offering 464 miles of pistes and 141 lifts.

The hotel is modern and well equipped but does not suffer from the jarring ugliness of other large hotels in some French resorts. Instead it nestles unobtrusively just a short walk from the atmospheric town centre.

David found it a delight to watch his boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning

The boys' room, with en suite shower was huge and sunny. Two balconies (both with reassuringly high safety rails) offered magnificent views across and down the pretty Tarentaise Valley and were a wonderful spot to enjoy afternoon tea.

Thomas and Jack chose to sleep together in a comfortable double sized sofa bed but there were facilities to sleep at least three more kids easily. There was plenty of room to hang damp ski clothes and to scatter toys brought from home. 

Elizabeth and I were in an adjoining en suite bedroom - also surprisingly large, with modern furnishings, contemporary decor and a large bathroom with shower and bath. 

We were on the third floor, conveniently just along the corridor from the boot room from which you can ski straight on to the piste.

Thomas and Jack were always keen to go swimming – even after a long day skiing - and I found it a great way to relax. 

The peaceful spa, which overlooks the pool has a steam room and sauna and two highly skilled masseurs, trained to melt away the aches and pains.

Evening meals are organised so that children eat separately from their parents. I have heard sneering criticism of this kind of arrangement - cited as evidence that unlike others in Europe we English don't really like our kids - what rot! 

Our children relished the chance to lark about and swap tales of derring-do with new pals they'd made in ski school and would have been dead on their feet had they stayed up late enough to eat with us.

To be honest after a long day skiing it was a relief to simply hand them over at the restaurant at around 6pm and leave the staff to shepherd them through the noisy and raucous meal knowing that we could enjoy a quiet and relaxing five course feast, with wine, once they'd gone to bed.

After dinner the fun continued for the children with lots of organised activities. You can sit back and let them run wild safe in the knowledge that they are loving every minute of it and are safe in the hands of the bright, young and enthusiastic staff who are all British. When it is time for the kids to go to bed a member of staff keeps a reassuring eye on them until you turn in yourself.

The ever present army of Esprit Ski staff are the hotel's greatest asset. It was a delight to watch our boys shepherded off to ski school in the morning too busy and excited for goodbye kisses and good luck wishes. 

And what a joy to see them just two days into the holiday snaking their way down a blue run, rosy cheeked and fearless. As I looked on I was puffed up with fatherly pride and dying to give them a hug.

I am not going to beat around the bush. If you are planning your first family skiing holiday and you want someone else to take the strain, you should stay here.

Our boys loved ski school in the morning and were happy to join us on the slopes after lunch. The nursery slopes are a good size for those who need to build confidence and access to them is easy and efficient. 

It was holiday packed with memories I will treasure all my life. On one exciting outing we took a trip up to the top of Bellecote Glacier at 3,417m to see the impressive ice sculptures in the Grottes de Glace, or ice caves. 

Jack loves polar bears and was overjoyed to come face to face with one carved into to ice.The run down was too difficult for me and the boys so we came down in the bubble car while my wife skied and met us for a hot chocolate lower down in the valley. 

This year I'm sure the boys will be racing down with their mum - I'll stick to the bubble car.
