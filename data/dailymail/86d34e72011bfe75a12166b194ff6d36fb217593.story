The SAS is set to axe its Land Rover fleet after five decades of frontline service in special forces operations across the globe.

After an outstanding record of service, the British Army has decided to retire the ageing Land Rovers and replace them with hi-tech vehicles which can offer better protection to soldiers.

It comes as Land Rover prepares to end production of the Defender model - on which military vehicles are based - after 67 years. Its planned replacement is yet to be launched.

Land Rovers were used and much-loved by Sir Winston Churchill and for many years the Queen - who also drives them - stood in a military Land Rover when she inspected troops at ceremonial events.

Adapted military Land Rovers were used by the SAS to help target Scud missiles during the Iraq war and heavily armed versions of the vehicle were used to hunt Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.

Now military procurement chiefs at the MoD’s Defence Equipment and Support Agency are to issue a tender for a replacement, which is expected to be based on the current Husky vehicle - used in Afghanistan.

Since it was first introduced the military have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the UK built Land Rover with the most famous being those used by the SAS in the desert.

They were nicknamed ‘pinkies’ after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes.

The Land Rover has been sold to armies 
across the world with the Australian and American special forces buying 
‘unique variants’ for front line operations.

Across the British Army, Land Rovers have been used in Malaya, at Suez and Aden while in Northern Ireland they became they spearheaded the internal security operation on the streets.

The Royal Marines mounted anti-tank guns on them, the artillery used a tracked version and during the Gulf war they were airlifted by helicopter into the desert.

But while the reliability of the Land Rover was never questioned, the reputation of the vehicle was tarnished when military bosses deployed so-called ‘snatch’ versions to southern Iraq.

These had been used as riot vehicles in Northern Ireland. But the Snatch provided little protection against improvised roadside bombs and after a series of fatalities was quickly dubbed the ‘coffin’ by soldiers.

A senior Army source said the Land Rover had served the military well, but after almost 50 years of service it was time for a change and a vehicle that was more relevant for today’s battlefield.

He added: ‘The Land Rover has been the work horse of UK armed forces, but I suspect Afghanistan will be its last operational deployment’.

The last of the current civilian Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December 2015.

The original Defender workhorse off-roader began life in 1948 as a £450 agricultural aid for farmers.

Astonishingly, some three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are still in regular use.

Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover also goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.

The Queen used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953, Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II’s tour of England in 1982.

And shortly after ending his love affair with young Princess Margaret in the 1950s, former battle of Britain pilot Group Captain Peter Townsend set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world in his short Wheelbase Land Rover Station Wagon which he completed in 1957 and chronicled in his book ‘Earth, My Friend.’

Land Rover said last night: ‘Current Defender production will end, due to legislation, mid-decade.

‘As a business, we are currently reviewing our options based on the clear company brand vision to develop three product pillars of Luxury, Leisure and Dual Purpose. We have stated our intention to replace Defender but have nothing to add at this time.’
