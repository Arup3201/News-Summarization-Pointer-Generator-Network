A nuclear power plant has been forced to shut down because of an infestation of jellyfish-like creatures.

Diablo Canyon, in California, was completely closed yesterday after a swarm of salp was found clogging filters meant to keep marine life out and the unit cool.

The slimy sea creatures were discovered as part of the Pacific Gas & Electric plant's routine monitoring system.

Tom Cuddy, senior communications manager, said: 'We made the conservative decision to ramp down the affected unit to 20 per cent and continued to monitor the situation.

'When the problem continued, we made another conservative decision that it would be safest to curtail the power of the unit.

'Safety is the highest priority. We will not restart the unit until the salp moves on and conditions improve. No priority is more important than safe operation of our facility.'

The San Luis Obispo County plant consists of two units and provides around 2,300 megawatts of power - enough to put the lights on in 1.5million homes.

Unit 1 was shut down previously because of refuelling and maintenance work and will not be functional for several weeks.

Similar to jellyfish they can grow to nearly four inches in length

Found in warm seas, they are more common in the southern hemisphere

As filter feeders, they pump water through a mucus net in their hollow bodies to trap microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton

Now that Unit 2 has been shut down because of the influx of salp, the Avila Beach plant has ceased all production.

The shutdown leaves California, at least temporarily, without nuclear power generation - which usually accounts for 14 per cent of the state's electricity supply.

But even with the Diablo Canyon plant out of commission, PG&E has pledged to continue production using other sources of power so that customers are unaffected by the closure.

The San Onofre nuclear plant, between Los Angeles and San Diego, has been closed since January.

Operator Southern California Edison is trying to solve the problem of 'unusual, rapid degradation' of tubes inside recently replaced steam generators.

Cuddy added: 'We've had salp cling to the intake structure before, but nothing to this extent.'

And he said that the plant would simply have to wait until the salp move on before they can resume production once the filers are clear.
