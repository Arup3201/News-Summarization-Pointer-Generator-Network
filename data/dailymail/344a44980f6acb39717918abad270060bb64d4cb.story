A care worker who burgled the homes of the elderly people she was paid to look after has been jailed today.

Michelle Williams, 30, used her own set of keys to gain access to the victims' homes as they slept, while her boyfriend Terence Fox, 22, stood guard outside.

Williams and Fox went on ’an appalling catalogue’ of burglaries, using some of the £1,910 they stole from their frail victims to buy a PlayStation.

Callous: Care worker Michelle Williams used her own keys to enter the homes of the pensioners she was meant to care for while her boyfriend Terence Fox stood guard outside

A court heard Williams would enter the homes of the elderly people she was meant to care for while Fox stood outside and held a torch to guide her as she carried out the thefts.

Their crime spree was not stopped until a neighbour caught them raiding the home of a 96-year-old woman.

Prosecutor Ian Ibrahim said: ‘Williams was trusted with keys to gain access without the frail occupants having to answer their door.

‘She let herself into their homes while the victims were sleeping and took money from their purses.

‘All the victims were aged between 59 and 96 years old.'

Disgrace: The pair, pictured playing up for the camera, raided a total of eight homes of elderly pensioners

Thief: During one of their raids, Williams took £770 from an 86-year-old woman and used it to buy a PlayStation

Cold heart: Michelle Williams was on sick leave at the time of the burglaries, but had still retained the keys to her clients' homes

He added: ‘Williams stole £770 from the handbag of an 86-year-old client - part of which was used to buy a Playstation.

‘The elderly lady had no idea Williams had been in her house - only discovering the money had gone later.’

Swansea Crown Court heard Williams was on sick leave from her job as a carer at the time of the eight burglaries last November.

The pair were finally caught after a neighbour saw them entering the home of 96-year-old Doreen Williams.

Guilty: Williams and Fox were both jailed at Swansea Crown Court after admitting to the burglaries

Mr Ibrahim said: ‘The neighbour watched in the early hours as Fox and Williams pulled up in a car outside the house of Doreen Williams.

‘He saw the two go inside and noticed a torch being used. When he asked care staff the next day they confirmed there had been no call-out in the middle of the night.’

Williams and Fox, of Morriston, Swansea, held hands and cried in the dock as the court heard they escaped with £1,910 from their frail and elderly victims.

Judge Keith Thomas said the pair had carried out ‘an appalling catalogue’ of burglaries, preying on vulnerable people in their 80s.

Williams admitted eight burglaries and one attempted burglary, Fox, pleaded guilty to seven burglaries and one attempted burglary.

Williams was sentenced to two years in jail and Fox was jailed for 20 months.
