Tragedy: Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, died while posing for photographs in her wedding dress in a river

A newlywed who drowned during a photo shoot in her wedding dress was purposefully in the water to take part in a popular ritual called 'Trash the Dress', it has emerged.

The practice, in which brides pose for pictures while playfully destroying their wedding gowns, had tragic consequences for Maria Pantazopoulos, when she was dragged under the water by the weight of her soaked dress.

'I can't anymore, it's too heavy,' she cried before letting go of the photographer and slipping under to her death, the Toronto Sun reported.

The 30-year-old  real estate agent, who had just bought a home with her new husband, was pulled into the Ouareau 
River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal, on Friday afternoon.

Her 
body was found about two-and-a-half hours later. Her bridal gown and high-heeled wedding shoes were later pictured lying on rocks along the river bed.

Ms Pantazopoulos had commissioned the shoot 
following her June 9 wedding and instructed the photographer, Louis Pagakis, to snap away while she was in the water.

'At one point, she told him, "I want you to take some photos of me floating in the water",' the photographer's wife, Anouk Benzacar, said.

But within moments of climbing in she realised that the weight of the soaked wedding dress was pulling her under.

Horror: Pantazopoulos' wedding dress and shoes remain on the rocks after she was dragged under water to her death while posing for pictures as part of a popular 'Trash the Dress' ritual

Killed: A scuba diver found her body around 30 meters from her original posing place

'She was screaming and scratching and trying to stay above water, Benzacar said. '[Louis] tried to swim with her, but she was pulling him down. She was too heavy. He couldn't breathe anymore.'

Pagakis told CTV Montreal that he did everything he could to save her.

'She
had her wedding dress on and she said, "take some pictures of me while I
swim a little bit in the lake,"' he said. 'She went in and her dress got heavy, I 
tried everything I could to save her.'

Leeza Pousoulidis told the Montreal Gazette her friend wanted 'Trash the Dress' photographs.

Struggle: Rescue teams attempted to save Pantazopoulos, but her body was found two hours later

Crime scene: Police found her body at 6pm on Friday after she failed to stay above water in the heavy dress

'She’s a really fun girl, and she just didn’t want her wedding dress 
sitting in a box in the closet,' she said. 'She said "I want to have fun with my wedding dress. I want to have great pictures and memories of me in my wedding dress."'

The soaked dress would have weighed at least 100 pounds, provincial policeman Jean-Michel Masse said. 'It was like an anvil,' he added to the QMI news agency.

Pantazopoulos had just bought a house in the picturesque city of Laval, Quebec with her husband, Billy, and they had planned on starting a family right away, friends told the Sun.

Ms Pousoulidis said her friend was 'a strong, tough girl'.

'She was very petite, but she was strong in character and in physical strength as well. She was very happy and caring. She had a big heart.'

Quebec provincial police spokesman 
Sgt. Ronald McInnis described the site as being elevated and rocky, with
water 'violently' rushing below.

Distraught: Photographer Louis Pagakis said that he did everything he could to save Ms Pantazopoulos

Plunge: She was pulled into the Ouareau River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal in Canada

'She
was doing the photo shoot in about six inches or one foot of water when 
part of her wedding dress got soaked and became extremely heavy,' Mr McInnis told MailOnline.

'She
started slipping and falling down when the photographer grabbed her but
she was too heavy that he couldn't pull her from the edge.

'Another person tried to grab her but also was unable to save her from falling into the river.'

Mr McInnis
said Ms Pantazopoulos, from Laval, a small Island north of Montreal, was 
found 100 feet from where she fell by a private diver who knows the 
river and volunteered to help with the search.

The
diver pulled the young woman’s body from an area of the river which was 20 feet deep.

Loss: Pantazopoulos, a real estate agent, had just bought a home with her new husband, Billy

Ritual: This file picture shows a bride taking part in the 'Trash the Dress' phenomenon

'She had sunk to the bottom,' Mr McInnis said.

Two witnesses, the photographer and an assistant, were hospitalised for extreme shock.

Mr McInnis
said the bride's husband was not present for the photo-shoot and 
neither were any family members. However, her cousins and her brother went to the site when they heard that she had died.

'It's horrible,' Mr McInnis said. 'This is the first time I've heard of a 
story like that. I told my partner, this is a story that is going to go 
all around the world.'

Ms Pantazopoulos's family has declined to speak to the media.
