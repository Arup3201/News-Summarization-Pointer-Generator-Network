The organizers of a high school reunion are embroiled in a tense war of words after they sent out invitations to segregated parties.

Ever since they graduated from St. Martinville Senior High School in 1973, alumni have attended separate receptions based on their race.

This year was supposed to put an end to the segregated parties, however, but the invitation was sent out before the changes were made so now people are outraged at the continually-outdated and offensive practice.

'This year, 2012, was going to be the first year that we were going to integrate it,' organizer Liza Chance told local ABC affiliate KATC.

'It needs to go forward, I don't understand why it went the way it did.'

The letter, which was sent to graduates by mail but also posted online, said that the 'After Game Get Together' that was scheduled to take place at an individual's house on Friday September 21 would be open to 'white graduates only'.

By contrast, the homecoming game at the school was open to 'all graduates'.

The principal of the school, which sits just outside Lafayette, Louisiana, says that while he feels that the segregated receptions damage the school's reputation, he has no control over the events since they are planned by an outside committee.

'We have our reception here at the school and all of the graduates are invited,' principal Michael Kreamer told the station.

'I'm just a little disappointed that something like this comes up. I don't think it looks good for the school but again as I said it has nothing to do with St. Martinville Senior High School so I hope people don't take it the wrong way.'
