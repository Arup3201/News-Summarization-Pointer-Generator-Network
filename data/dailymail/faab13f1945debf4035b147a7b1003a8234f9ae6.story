Luke Shaw thinks Manchester United are having a lot of bad luck with refereeing decisions and that Wayne Rooney's red card against West Ham was harsh.

The England captain hacked Stewart Downing with a cynical kick from behind while the Hammers midfielder was racing away from his own box in the second half.

However, Shaw feels the referee should have blown moments earlier for a handball.

'We haven't had much luck with either decision,' said the United left back.

'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza's red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn't stop play.' 

Shaw, who moved to United from Southampton for £31million this summer, put in a good performance down the left, where he combined well with club record signing Angel di Maria. 

And he added: 'When I started my debut (for Southampton) at Stevenage, I said to myself I want to be playing for the best teams in the best league.

'I've done that at the moment and now it's my chance to keep improving as a player. I feel I can do that now.'

Shaw has had an eventful three months at Old Trafford. Shortly after making his competitive England debut at the World Cup, Shaw incurred the wrath of Van Gaal for turning up to pre-season out of shape.

The Dutchman made Shaw train on his own on the tour of the United States and said: 'Luke needs to be fit and he's not very fit. He can't perform how I want.'

However, Van Gaal was so impressed with the 19-year-old's attitude in training, that he said the teenager was 'an example' to the rest of his star-studded United squad.

'For him to say I'm an example at a massive club like this is something to be really happy about,' the England defender said.

'He was right to say what he said about me in pre-season.

'We had a discussion then and the plan for me was to get my fitness up. It worked, apart from the injury.

'It was a bit of setback but I've worked hard in the last weeks and had some talks. He's been a great inspiration to me and hopefully I can carry that on.'
