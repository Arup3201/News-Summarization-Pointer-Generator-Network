Dubious Facebook 'friends' could stand in the way of you getting a loan thanks to new technology.

Savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their pals pay off their debts.

The tech start ups, including Lenddo, trawl through an applicants online friends in a bid to determine whether anyone in your network has failed to pay back a loan.

'It turns out humans are really good 
at knowing who is trustworthy and reliable in their community,' Jeff 
Stewart, a co-founder and CEO of lending start up, Lenddo, told CNN 
Money. 'What's new is that we're now able to measure through massive 
computing power.'

Traditional lenders, such as banks, rely heavily on official credit scores based on payment history.

But newer lenders believe social connections can also be a good indicator of a person's creditworthiness.

After a quick search, Lenddo can work out if any of your Facebook friends have been late paying back a loan to Lenddo. If so, they're less likely to offer you a line of credit. The situation gets even worse if the delinquent friend is someone you interact with regularly.

Another company, German-based Kreditech told CNN it uses eBay or Amazon accounts as well as Facebook to check whether a potential borrower is high or low risk.

Kreditech also gathers information from the manner in which a customer fills out the online application - if someone uses all capitals or no capitals they'll lose a few points.

The business can determines your location based on where your computer is, and therefore takes into account where you live or work - the posher area the better obviously.

The range of information about a would-be borrow doesn't mean much apart but when brought together it paints a pretty good picture of the applicant, Sebastian Diemer, a co-founder of Kreditech, told the news website.

Kabbage, an online service that offers cash advances to small businesses, says it can get 'much better, faster data' than a traditional credit score by checking PayPal, eBay and other online payment accounts for real time proof of creditworthiness.

The company told CNN it can determine whether someone is worth the risk and put money into their account in just seven minutes.

Most lending start ups currently attract niche borrowers, for example Kabbage wants to lend to small businesses who operate online, where as Lenddo and Kreditech target middle-class people in emerging markets where credit is hard to access.

But using social data to assess credit risk is on the verge of going mainstream, according to the report.

Kreditech has began selling its technology to national online lenders in Russia and the Czech Republic and Kabbage sees itself taking similar steps.

But the method has its critics.

John Ulzheimer, a credit expert at CreditSesame.com, claims Facebook friends aren't necessarily indicative of whether someone will pay back a loan on time. Where as the more tradition FICO considers factors that are all 'incredibly predictive of risk,' Ulzheimer said.

It is also easier for individuals to control their credit score, by ditching dubious friends on Facebook for example.

'To me, using social media is a little bit dangerous,' he said.
