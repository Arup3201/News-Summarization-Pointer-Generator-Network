Jailed: Timothy Deakin, 18, approached Luke Chadwick in a bar and pretended to whisper in his ear but then bit it off in an unprovoked attack

A teenage yob bit off a stranger’s ear in a random attack after he exploited cheap 'two for a fiver' spirit promotions to drink himself into a stupor.

Timothy Deakin, 18, had spent £30 on Jagerbomb alcoholic energy drinks and knocked back ten double brandies and cola on a night out at three different bars before attacking Luke Chadwick.

The victim, 21, who was at Pics Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester, thought Deakin was whispering something to him but then suddenly felt a 'strange sensation'.

He then saw Deakin spit something on the floor but had no idea what it was until moments later when other revellers asked why he was bleeding from the side of his face.

Police were called to the bar, arrested Deakin and had to search the club for the ear. The victim now suffers a 'significant cosmetic disability'.

Deakin woke up in a police cell claiming he could remember nothing of the incident. He recalled drinking in Yates wine lodge and neighbouring GCHQ bar but remembered nothing else.

He told police: 'I had been drinking in Yates in Bury. I went to GCHQ but from that point remember nothing - I woke up in a cell at the police station.

'I drank around ten double brandy and Cokes and spent £30 on Jagerbombs - they were two for £5. I wonder if my drink was spiked as the effects came on so fast. I do not know Luke Chadwick and if I have caused the injury I am very sorry.'

Details of the attack earlier this month emerged as Deakin, also known as Timothy Tibble, was jailed for four years and eight months after he admitted wounding with intent.

Bolton Crown Court was told Deakin, who already had 26 previous convictions and had been locked away when he was 13, went on his giant drinking spree on October 5.

Mr Benjamin Myers prosecuting said he approached Mr Chadwick inside Pic's bar and leaned over as if to ‘whisper’ something in his ear.

Black-out: Deakin was arrested after the attack at Pic's Bar in Bury, 
Greater Manchester, but had no recollection of the incident when he 
awoke in a police cell the next morning. He admitted he'd spent £30 on 
'two for a fiver' Jagerbombs and had also consumed ten double brandies with cola that night

'Mr Chadwick felt a strange sensation in his ear and at first didn’t know what had happened,' said Mr Myers.

'At that point he saw the defendant spit something out onto the floor. When he went outside people asked why he was bleeding from the side of his head.

'Police soon entered and the defendant was restrained and he said he hadn’t done anything wrong. An officer had to perform a search inside the club to see if he could find the ear.'

Mr Chadwick was said to have been left in deep shock by the incident. In mitigation Deakin’s counsel Michael Johnson said he had acted in a ‘moment of madness’, and undone any positive work he had been doing under the guidance of the authorities.

Mr Johnson added: 'He didn’t enjoy love and affection during his childhood,' he said. 'His parents had addiction issues. But there is potential for him to move forward when he is released.'

Sentencing, Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'With no provocation you approached another man with whom you had no grievance and in a very determined way you sunk your teeth into one of his ears and bit him until you succeeded in severing a significant portion of his ear and then spat it out on the floor.

'You didn’t have any explanation for what you did apart from you were drunk. You have a personal background which has resulted in a substantial disadvantage to your growing up.

'It is hoped that with assistance you will leave behind your troubled beginnings and as an adult you will go on to live a law abiding and responsible life.'

According to its Facebook page, Pic's Bar, which opens until 4am, sells two cocktails for £5 and offers 'half price Jagerbombs all night’.

This week GCHQ bar were advertising a Halloween event where drinks cost just £1. Yates were advertising two cocktail jugs for £10 and other drinks as little as £1.50.

Scientists have warned Jagerbombs - and mixing other alcohol with energy drinks like Red Bull - was more likely to trigger impulsive and often 'risky behaviour' than drinking traditional cocktails like a gin and tonic.
