A military veteran was left devastated after his beloved dog was shot dead by his neighbor.

Benjamin Wilson, a police officer, was returning home with his wife and children on Tuesday afternoon, when he claims his dog and his neighbor's dog were barking at each other.

The off-duty police officer said that Coty Calviera's dog Zeus stood by his car, trapping his family inside at their home in Carolina Forest, South Carolina.

Wilson, 25, told police that he managed to escape from the car and get into his home while avoiding the dog.

When he returned with his gun, Zeus had run off and the family were able to go indoors. He then went to bring his own dog inside when Mr Calviera's dog 'returned and was aggressive towards him', according to WMBF.

Wilson said that he fired a shot into the ground to scare the dog - but when it came at him, he fired three more shots and killed it.

He later said he shot the dog in self-defense and no charges were filed against the police officer of five years.

Mr Calviera, who was diagnosed with 
post-traumatic stress syndrome after he left the Army, was told by 
another nieighbor that a dog had been shot.

The veteran grabbed his gun for protection and went outside - only to make the horrific discovery that it was his pet dog Zeus.

Mr Calviera, 27, told the TV station that his beloved dog's blood was all over the neighbor's yard from  where it had been shot in the chest and back. Along with his family, he buried Zeus a few hours later.

The war veteran had adopted two dogs Zeus and Marly after finishing tour of Iraq because animals are recommended to veterans to help them cope with the PTSD.
