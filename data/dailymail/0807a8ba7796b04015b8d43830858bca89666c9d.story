Brainchild: The concept of bringing ice to a hot climate was the idea of Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor

Having ice cubes in your drink as you relax on a hot beach is an enjoyable, but not innovative concept.

But the idea of bringing ice to a warm climate was in fact the revolutionary idea of Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor. 

His vision was to carve frozen water out of a Massachusetts pond and send it to hotter exotic climates.

By 1805 ice had taken its place as a summertime luxury with the wealthy residents of Boston

During that year, it was suggested to Tudor, reportedly while he was at a party, that there was a market for overseas ice. 

The idea appealed to Tudor's entrepreneurial skills and he decided to set up a business of harvesting ice in tropic lands.

His supply of ice was obtained nearby from Fresh Pond, a reservoir in Cambridge.

His plan of a foreign ice trade proved difficult to put into practice - it failed many times as the ice melted while he shipped it to Martinique and Cuba, reports The Atlantic.

But Tudor was determined to bring his plan to fruition and realised he could minimise the melting by packing the ice tighter as well as insulating it with sawdust 
instead of straw.

His perseverance paid off and Tudor made his first profits by 1810.

But his good luck took a turn for the worst when he landed in debtor's prison after being swindled by a business partner.

His spell in prison did not not put 
him off and once he was released, he secured a loan from friends and 
family enabling him to continue with his obsession.

He
later summed up his determination at the front of his thick ledger 
which over the course of the years became his 'Ice-House Diary,' 
according to Ice Harvesting USA.

'He
who gives back at the first repulse and without striking the second 
blow' he wrote, 'despairs of success has never been, is not, and never 
will be a hero in war, love, or business.'

His business model proved to be simple but effective - at first Tudor gave away his ice 
for free, reasoning customers would return and pay for ice once they had experienced the new sensation.

After people tried their
drinks cold, they could 'never be presented with them warm again,' 
Tudor boasted.

The ice was laboriously cut by hand with saws, until Tudor hired a new foreman named Nathaniel Wyeth.

The Tudor Ice company continued to be a success and ship around the world until domestic electric refrigerators became available in the early 1900s

Wyeth developed a horse-drawn ice plough and a system cutting ice into blocks about two feet square.

His plan was to Tudor's advantage - the mass-produced ice was easier to transport and store, reducing his costs significantly. 

Wyeth also invented above-ground ice houses, with double walls for insulation.

As the Dictionary of American Biography states, '[I]t was said at his death that practically every implement and device used in the ice business had been invented by Nat Wyeth.'

But Tudor's real success came in 1833 when he set his sights to India and decided to transport ice 14,000 miles across the ocean. 

The large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to India by Captain Codman in the ship Nantasket, proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay.

In comparison to the slush residents were used to for only a few weeks a year, Tudor's crystal clear ice proved an instant hit.

The India Gazette thanked him for making 'this luxury accessible, by its abundance and cheapness' and Calcutta became his most profitable destination.

At one point in Tudor's incredible 
career, he had owned ice-houses all over the world - in Havana, Jamaica,
New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Galle, and 
Singapore.

According to iceharvesting.com, he died at 80 years old, worth about $12 million in today's rate.

Although he died in 1864, the Tudor Ice Company carried on the name for a number of years.

By 1900 nearly every family, grocer and barkeeper in the USA had an icebox.

During the early 1900s domestic electric refrigerators became available, and by the 1940s they were common in U.S. homes.

Frederic 'The Ice King' Tudor's dream was to bring ice cut from the frozen water of a Massachusetts pond to ship it to hotter exotic climates.

Tudor had labourers who would 
painstakingly cut out blocks of ice from the frozen Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during the winter using pickaxes and saws before transporting it in hay-lined carriages to
be stored in ice houses. 

But
once his ice was prepared, he faced an even bigger challenge - how to 
transport the ice, possibly for several months, and then store it in a 
hot country without it melting.

Tudor
had packed his ice in hay but later discovered sawdust was the best at 
preventing ice from melting.

Despite
finding a way to stop his ice from melting during the voyage overseas, 
he couldn't find a merchant willing to ship water - even if it was 
frozen - inside their ship.

Tudor
was eventually forced to buy his own brig called the Favourite for 
$4,750 and set sail for the Caribbean in 1806 with 130 tons of ice cut 
from a pond on the family estate outside Boston.

The ice survived the three-week voyage but melted away in Martinique because there were no icehouses to store it.

In 1825, Tudor teamed up with one of his suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, who invented a two-bladed, horse-drawn ice cutter.

Sea merchants refused to store water inside their ships so Tudor eventually bought his own brig called the favourite, similar to the one pictured above, to ship his ice cargo abroad

Previously, the ice had been laboriously cut with saws. Wyeth's horse-drawn ice plough sped up the process and meant ice could be cut into blocks about two feet square.

The device scored an ice sheet into a checkerboard grid of blocks that could easily be pried out with iron bars.

Tudor then took on his biggest challenge - a 16,000-mile journey from Boston to Calcutta in 1833.

The large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to India by Captain Codman in the another ship Nantasket, proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay.

The India Gazette thanked him for making 'this luxury accessible, by 
its abundance and cheapness' and Calcutta became his most profitable 
destination.

At one point in Tudor's incredible 
career, he had owned ice-houses all over the world - in Havana, Jamaica,
New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Galle, and 
Singapore.
