A Florida woman who climbed on top of a manatee and rode the creature while swimming at a Florida beach on Sunday has turned herself in - and she may be charged with a crime.

Manatees - large, underwater mammals also known as sea cows - are protected in the state and it is a crime to 'intentionally annoy, harass or disturb' the animals.

But that didn't stop Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez - dressed in a black and white bikini top, red boardshorts and a white cap - from catching a ride on one of the creatures at Fort DeSoto Park.

Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman 'riding' the animal. But when they arrived, the culprit had disappeared.

However, a quick-thinking onlooker 
managed to take photographs of the woman's joy ride.

After the photos of were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, the 52-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in yesterday.

She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong.

Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids 'activities may not, either intentionally or negligently, molest, harass, collide with, injure or harm manatees.'

Illegal: Under Florida law, it is illegal to 'annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee'

Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was 'outrageous' and warned people to leave the animals alone.

'This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them,' he said during a news conference.

'It's pretty outrageous when somebody does that.'

But the sheriff's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputyâ€™s presence.

Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney's Office.

'It's clear from the photographs that's what she was doing,' Gualtieri added.

'We are asking for the public's help in identifying this woman so that the deputies can place the appropriate criminal charges against her.'

The unlucky sea cow wasn't believed to have been hurt in the incident.

But the woman, if caught, will likely face a second degree misdemeanor charge for disturbing the mammal and possibly even prison time.
