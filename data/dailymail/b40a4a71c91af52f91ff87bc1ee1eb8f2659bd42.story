New York City FC will oppose any move from Manchester City to keep Frank Lampard at the Etihad Stadium for longer than his agreed loan spell.

Lampard has been a hit at City since his loan from their sister club in the MLS started recently, scoring once against Chelsea and twice in the Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday.

The 36-year-old’s impressive form has prompted suggestions that he may prove useful to City boss Manuel Pellegrini beyond the length of his current loan spell that is due to end in January.

Pellegrini has not ruled out the possibility of Lampard staying but sources in America stressed on Thursday that New York City FC expect their marquee signing to be in the States for pre-season training in the new year after building a marketing strategy around him and selling tickets due to his transfer.

While there is no suggestion that City and the MLS franchise it established last year are pulling in opposite directions, it would appear that City fans will have to make do with just five months of the former England star.

Asked about the Lampard stories on Tuesday this week, NYCFC coach Jason Kreis said: ‘There is no truth in this rumour at all.’

The MLS season doesn’t start until March and there is an argument that Lampard won’t need a pre-season if he has been playing with City. However, it is understood that officials in New York see Lampard as their big sell this season — even more so than fellow summer signing David Villa — and want him available for their training camp and a series of warm-up games.

Lampard steered clear of the issue on Thursday, saying he would let the two clubs make the decision.

‘I’m contracted here until the start of January and that is how it is at the moment,’ he said. 

‘More than that, I don’t know. The argument (about me staying) has only come up since I scored at the weekend. The important thing for me is to train well, play well and then see what happens.

‘I signed on here until January so that is all I can say. When I signed for Man City on loan, six weeks or so ago, it was always until January and that is the way it remains so I wouldn’t want to get too far ahead of myself.

The former England star signed for New York City FC in July but went on loan to City almost immediately 

‘It is not my place to do that. It would be a club decision, first and foremost. I will train and play as well as I can and the rest is up to the club.’

Lampard enjoyed a memorable night on Wednesday and found himself in an embrace with a young fan who ran on to the field five minutes from the end to take a ‘selfie’ with his favourite player. The 15-year-old was released on bail by Greater Manchester Police until October 19 after being arrested on suspicion of encroachment of the pitch. He is expected to be banned for three games by City.

Lampard had been at Chelsea for 13 years prior to joining City and it has clearly been a challenge to adjust to a new environment. ‘Yes, it’s been very different,’ he admitted. ‘I was at Chelsea such a long time you just go along on auto-pilot in the end. You know how it is, you drive in every day, you know everybody behind the scenes.

The 36-year-old was hugely emotional after scoring against his old club Chelsea on Sunday

‘It was a tester for me to come here. I didn’t have to make this decision but it was a very good opportunity for me to train and play at this level which arose.

‘And it is a personal test to come up to Manchester and be up here for this six months, or five months, whatever it is. I was very much in a comfort zone at Chelsea. I worked at Chelsea for 13 years, trained there, played there and now it is different. It is good to test yourself in life and all I can say is that I am enjoying it.

‘I’m very fortunate. Not many players at the age of 36 get the opportunity to come and play among these players. When you look around the dressing room there is so much quality and that is a real honour for me to come and play amongst that.’
