The severe weather, which has been described as the summer's second 'derecho', claimed the lives of two people. A derecho is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.

A prosecutor with the state attorney 
general’s office was killed after he was hit by scaffolding and bricks that 
fell from a church steeple that was struck by lightning in Brooklyn, New 
York, according to the New York Post.

Richard Schwartz, 61, was taken to Long Island College Hospital in Brookyn where he was pronounced dead.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman released a statement about the tragic death. 'I send my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Assistant Attorney General Richard Schwartz who was tragically killed last night as a result of the storm,' Schneiderman said in a statement.

'For over 25 years, Richard served the people of New York State with integrity as an expert antitrust lawyer in the Office of the Attorney General's economic justice division. New York is a better place because of Richard's commitment to fairness and legal excellence. Richard's loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers as we mourn the untimely loss of one of our own.'

Governor Andrew Cuomo also paid tribute to Schwartz, saying: 'His commitment to placing the needs of New Yorkers above all else will be remembered and cherished. His work ethic and his passion were an inspiration to all who had the privilege of knowing him.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues with whom he worked during his many years in State service.'

A woman who was camping in Genesee, Pennsylvania, near the New York State line, was also killed when she took refuge from the storm in her car and a tree then fell on it, John Hetrick, director of emergency services for Potter County, said.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared an emergency for Chemung County after a tornado touched down in the city of Elmira, in north-west New York State, at 4.15pm to allow the state to mobilize state resources to assist local governments.

'This state of emergency declaration 
will help the state get critical resources to communities that were hit 
the hardest,' Cuomo said.

A derecho is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.

It can produce destruction similar to that of tornadoes, while the damage typically is directed in one direction.

As a result, the term 'straight-line wind damage' is sometimes used to describe the phenomenon.

To be classified as a derecho, the line of storms must travel at least 240 miles and include wind gusts of at least 58 mph.

In one four-block neighborhood in 
Elmira, most homes had trees toppled upon them, street signs were bent 
in half and tree trunks had debris wrapped around them. Several cars 
were crushed by downed trees, while one two-story brick building had most of the second story torn off in the storm.

On Friday morning, most power remained out for the city's 29,000 residents.

As the storms sent black, menacing 
clouds rolling across Midwest and Northeast, hail ranging from the size 
of a dime to a quarter fell in some areas of Pennsylvania, 
AccuWeather.com said.

Meteorologists said 70-mile-per-hour (113-kph) winds were reported in parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma.

Hundreds of flights were cancelled and at least 300,000 homes suffered power cuts in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut after warnings of tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, hail and hurricane-strength winds along the East Coast. 

More than 900 flights in the U.S. were grounded with LaGuardia 
Airport in New York the worst affected with 162 planes unable to take 
off.

Around 32 million people were directly in the path of the storm yesterday including those
 in and around New York City, according to the Storm Prediction Center.

Skies darkened over Manhattan around 6pm with heavy downpours on the island and in the Bronx first, then rolling across Staten 
Island, Queens and Brooklyn.

City having 'unusually high chance' of tornadoes.

The outbreak threatened to be as bad as the derecho which left millions without powers for days in Washington, D.C. last month.

Authorities evacuated campsites across New York State. The Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation encouraged those in trailers, recreational vehicles and cabins to leave ten sites in the Allegany and Niagara regions of western New York and the Taconic and Palisades regions to the east.

Subway stations were shut down as water submerged tracks leaving many commuters  stranded.

Severe thunderstorms threatened Ohio and the lower northeast while areas from the upper Great Lakes and the 
Mid-Mississippi Valley northeastward to southern New England were at 
risk for severe weather development.

Elsewhere,
 hot and humid conditions coupled with continued instability led to 
chances of showers and thunderstorms along the eastern and central Gulf 
Coast. 

Monsoonal moisture 
and daytime heating will kick up areas of showers and thunderstorms in 
the Central and Southern Rockies through the afternoon and evening.

 in the Lower 48 states yesterday ranged from a morning low of 35
