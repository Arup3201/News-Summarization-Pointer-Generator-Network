Two brothers kidnapped a 16-year-old runaway and sold her for sex to as many as two dozen men every day, prosecutors in Miami said.

Bogacski Thomas and Tavarus Ballard, both 24, allegedly held the girl for two weeks, continually dosing her with drugs while they pimped her out to make money for hotel rooms, food and drugs.

They are said to have plied her with cocaine and MDMA, and threatened to hurt her family if she tried to escape. When she did try to flee, they beat her, court papers said.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said it was one of the worst cases she's seen. 'She to them was nothing more than a walking machine. No dignity, not a young girl. A cash machine,' CBS Miami quoted her as saying.

'She was forced to engage in sex, up to 24 men, up to 24 men per night,' Ms Fernandez Rundle said. 'That is a man every 30 minutes from 6am to 6pm at night. Only to repeat itself the next day and the next day.'

The local television station reported that Thomas faced so many charges he appeared unable to keep up as a judge read them aloud in bond court yesterday.

He and Ballard are accused of preying on the girl after she ran away from home, forcing her into prostitution for two weeks in January until she was able to escape.

To keep her subdued the pair allegedly provided her with cannabis, as well as spiking her food with 'Mollies' - a slang term for MDMA tablets - and lacing her cigarettes with cocaine.

They are said to have forced her to walk the streets of South Miami-Dade looking for Johns who paid just $100 dollars for full sex or $50 for a lesser sex act.

Thomas and Ballard also allegedly touted for customers as well, even visiting gas station bathrooms in their search for men who would pay to have sex with the underage girl.

'Thomas told the victim that if she tried to leave they knew where her family lived and they would shoot up her house and hurt or kill her family,' the warrant affidavit said.

Nevertheless, the victim made a number of attempts to flee that resulted in her suffering punishment beatings at the hands of both men, investigators said.

'Every time she tried to escape they would beat her up, grab her back,' Ms Fernandez Rundle said. 'In one case they picked her broken body up and took her back up into the motel.'

The girl was finally able to escape when she finished with a customer and realised Thomas was still in the bathroom of the hotel room where she was being kept, according to the warrant affidavit.

She is said to have fled on foot and took a bus to another part of town, but was soon spotted by Thomas and Ballard as she walked down a street.

Chased by both men, she ran into an abandoned house where they again subjected her to a vicious beating before themselves fleeing, according to the affidavit.

Thomas and Ballard are facing a string of charges including human trafficking, lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 16 and deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution.

Both men are being held at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, county records show. If they are found guilty they face life in jail.
