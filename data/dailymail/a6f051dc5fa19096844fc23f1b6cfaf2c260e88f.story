When my father cuts the grass, leaving neat parallel lines up and down the lawn, his two-year-old grandson — my son Milin — follows him with his toy mower.

Wherever Papa is, so too is his little shadow — copying, watching, unconsciously learning new skills from the grandfather he adores.

Milin can count up to 12: he has learned this with the gentle guidance of my father, a retired accountant, who bought him his first book of numbers.

Three generations of love: Kiran, Tony, Milin and Jasmin with Kiran’s selfless parents

My mother, a retired chemistry teacher, possesses similar patience. She has the capacity to distract my one-year-old daughter Jasmin with a puzzle or a picture book while spooning food into her mouth that she will not eat for me.

I had not realised just how valuable my own parents’ presence in my children’s lives would be until I moved back home with them — and brought my husband and two children with me.

I now appreciate the wonder of grandparents: they know how to quell an infant tantrum, how to cajole a reluctant baby into eating. This is because they have experience and wisdom. After all, they’ve practised with their own children.

Like so many 30 and 40-somethings, financial constraints mean my husband and I cannot yet afford a home in modern-day Britain. So, 18 months ago, we moved back in with my parents.

And the experience has taught me so much that I’m not sure we are in a hurry to leave.

Why? Nine years ago, my husband Tony and I decided to start a new life in New Zealand. For some years it was wonderful, but after my first baby, my heart began to ache with longing for my parents.

When they visited I was entranced by the way their smiling eyes would lock with my baby son’s. My mother had an amazing knack of soothing Milin. When he cried, she’d scoop him up and he’d instantly relax in her arms.

I had left my childhood home in Finchley, north London at 19 intending to forge my own path. I didn’t for a moment see myself returning to live with my parents again 15 years later, along with my own family.

But life doesn’t ever go to plan. If it did, the four of us would be making a home of our own, with Tony and I scratching our children’s heights on a door frame door.

Instead, we have joined the boomerang generation. We are back in the neat, four-bedroom, suburban semi where my parents raised my sister, Josleen, 31, and I.

And we’re not the only ones. Figures from the Office of National Statistics recently revealed that in 2013, more than 3.3 million adults in the UK aged between 20 and 34 — 26 per cent of this age group — were living with their parents, because of the economic downturn. This was almost 667,000 more than in 1996, the first year such figures were available.

So, how did Tony and I end up back home? I had read English Literature at Edinburgh University and while living there I met Tony, a graphic designer from New Zealand.

After graduating, Tony and I moved to his home country. Property was a third of the price it was in the UK capital, so for the cost of a two-bed flat in a dreary London suburb we could live in a spacious house with a garden.

Our careers flourished. I was working for a national newspaper, while Tony had a children’s book published and he’d become a freelance designer and illustrator. In November 2010, a few months before we married, we bought a home in Wellington for £250,000.

When Milin was born in December 2011, he made our house a home, I concluded. And yet when he turned one, and we had another baby on the way, the pull of my family in Britain had become wrenching. Tony’s parents are divorced and lived too far away to visit regularly. My parents had been to stay with us twice in Milin’s first six months. When it came for them to go back to London my heart almost broke.

The attraction of a life in England close to my mum and dad was stronger than the lure of our comfortable lifestyle in New Zealand. Duly, in January 2013, we moved back with only the sketch-iest of plans.

There was one thing we were sure about, though — we’d stay with my mum and dad until we found our feet. That was 18 months ago, and we are still no closer to having a home of our own.

Perhaps we will be ready to leave in a year. We do not really know.

Yet even as I contemplate leaving my parents, I feel ambivalent. If I do find work, if we find a home, we will still rely on them for childcare.

Without their help, we would be paying full-time nursery fees, making a home once again unaffordable.

But more than that, my parents’ constant presence in their grandchildren’s lives has enriched them immeasurably.

Almost three-quarter of a million British families have three or more generations living under one roof.

The other day Milin announced he knew his right hand from his left — ‘Papa taught me!’ And when he recites his numbers, and I watch my father’s proud smile, my heart does a little leap of joy.

Yet there are times when I feel, though my parents make no complaint, that we must have tried their patience. They should be enjoying their empty nest.

I look at the children’s playroom and know it should be used for entertaining. I look at the garden which we have converted into a mini obstacle course. We’ve taken the bedrooms on the first floor, and my parents had to retreat to the converted loft to sleep.

My parents are unfailingly tolerant, and despite the chaos, my mum has only once implored me to tidy up the children’s mess.

Caring for two young children is a young person’s job, so I know mum and dad must get tired, especially as the energy of a two-year-old boy is inexhaustible.

‘Let’s play football, Nanni,’ Milin will often beg, and my mother will dutifully spend the whole morning kicking a ball to and fro. After, I’ll beg her to go upstairs for a rest and she will insist she is ok.

But their energy does not flag. If Tony is not home in time for bedtime, Mum will improvise a story for Milin, who listens entranced.

Yet while I am moved beyond words by the bond between my children and my parents, I desperately wish we were making memories in our own home.

One day, our little family will have its own place. But from shared-living, I’ve learned that having the people you love around you when you are bringing up babies is immeasurably wonderful.

And Milin and Jasmin have gained most. I watch their daily interaction with their grandparents. I see my dad teaching Milin how to play golf in the garden, I watch my mother rock Jasmin to sleep in her arms.

Such inter-generational living is the norm in some families in my Punjabi culture, although it wasn’t a way of life my parents or I ever intended for ourselves.

But it has enriched us all. When I was exhausted after sleepless nights with a teething toddler, my mother was there to help. When Tony and I have looked at each other in despair, my father has been there quietly supportive, proffering advice if we needed it.

My parents’ magnanimity and generosity is humbling, and I am constantly amazed by the depth of their selflessness.

But Papa is 68 and my mother, 63. They should be downsizing to somewhere quiet and taking frequent holidays and entertaining friends for lunch and supper.

Tony and I miss our privacy and independence. We are sad, from time to time, about how life is.

But we are also hopeful. And above all, we are supremely, boundlessly grateful.
