Tragic: Bailey Ratcliffe died after mistakenly being given an overdose of anti-epilepsy medication

A five-year-old boy died after he was given an 'inappropriately high dose' of a drug when he was taken to hospital suffering an epileptic fit, a coroner has ruled.

Bailey Ratcliffe died after he was admitted to Dewsbury District Hospital on May 27 2009, an inquest has heard.

Yesterday, senior registrar Dr Helen Moore apologised in court for mistakes made when Bailey was given the drug phenytoin on her orders.

West Yorkshire Coroner Peter Straker gave a narrative verdict in which he said: 'Unfortunately, there were a number of individuals who did not recognise this error and, therefore, did not intervene and prevent Bailey from dying.'

The two-day inquest heard how Bailey had been fitting for three hours when he arrived at the hospital on May 27 2009.

He had been given other drugs by his family, paramedics and A&E staff to try and control the fitting but Dr Moore decided it was time to move on to phenytoin.

But the doctor admitted she made a mistake in the dosage instructions when she asked a junior doctor to prescribe the drug.

The court heard how other doctors and nurses were involved in the administration of the phenytoin and one nurse did question the large quantity of the drug she was being asked to prepare with Dr Moore.

But none of the medical staff stopped Bailey receiving a much larger dose than he was he supposed to.

Dr Moore told the court how she thought she got confused in her mind with the procedures for administering a different drug used in cases of severe asthma.

She said: 'I just made a mistake.'

Overdose: Five-year-old Bailey had been fitting for three hours when he was brought to Dewsbury Hospital

The court heard how Bailey was 
transferred to a paediatric ward in the hospital but, later that 
afternoon, he began to deteriorate and stopped breathing.

A full resuscitation team was called in but could not save his life.

The inquest heard Bailey died from phenytoin toxicity complicated by his epilepsy.

Bailey had six times the amount of phenytoin in his blood that was expected

Analysis of his blood after death showed it contained at least six times the expected level of phenytoin.

Mr Straker's narrative verdict stated: 'On May 27 2009, Bailey Ratcliffe was diagnosed with status epilepticus.

'At hospital, an inappropriately high dose of phenytoin was prescribed.

'There were systems in place to 
prevent such a prescription from being given but, unfortunately, there 
were a number of individuals who did not recognise this error and, 
therefore, did not intervene and prevent Bailey from dying.'

Bailey's mother, Carrianne Ratcliffe, 32, said: 'Since May 2009, my life has been turned upside down.

'My family and I have waited for over 
three years to finally come face to face with those responsible for the 
medication mistake and to get answers for what has tormented us since 
that day.'

Ms Ratcliffe, from Batley, West 
Yorkshire, said the family first thought her son had died of epilepsy 
and it was a number of months before they heard about the mistake.

She said: 'We are haunted by what happened.

'Not one, but four staff were involved
in Bailey's care and I still can't believe how they got the drug dosage
so badly wrong, but I am glad that this has been reflected in the 
coroner's verdict.'

Mrs Ratcliffe said: 'Bailey was such a special character who, despite his health problems, loved life.

Apology: Dr Helen Moore said she was 'sincerely sorry' for the mistakes that led to Bailey's death at Dewsbury Hospital

'He was a wonderful gift and he was 
snatched away from us. We will never get over losing Bailey, especially 
now when we should be looking forward to Christmas together.

'But I hope the hospital trust will 
ensure this never happens again so other mums don't lose their children 
in such horrible and preventable circumstances.'

The Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust has already admitted liability for his death in a civil claim.

The Crown Prosecution Service has already announced that no-one will be prosecuted in relation to Bailey's death.

Anna Bosley, from the law firm Irwin 
Mitchell, who represented the family, said: 'Carrianne trusted the 
hospital to look after her son and she was badly let down, but she is 
reassured that lessons have been learned and steps taken to ensure that 
accidental overdoses are avoided in future.

'This case is a stark reminder that one error can have such devastating consequences for patients and their families.'
