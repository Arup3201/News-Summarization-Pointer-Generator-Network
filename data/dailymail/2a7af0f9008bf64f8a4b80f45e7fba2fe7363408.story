Hot and settled weather is set to last into next week as Britain bathes in 30C sunshine ahead of the main school holiday getaway this weekend.

The recent warm weather has boosted the numbers taking last-minute trips in the UK, but Spain is said to be the number one continental destination.

More than two million Britons will head overseas this weekend, with 450,000 passengers expected to descend on London Heathrow Airport.

Forecast: Tomorrow will be dry and fine for most, but a few scattered heavy and locally-thundery showers could break out in the South in the afternoon

While today was warm and dry for most of England, a few thundery downpours were expected to develop in the South West.

The
 Met Office has activated a yellow 'be aware' weather warning for rain 
in Cornwall and Devon covering this afternoon and evening until 9pm.

The
 top UK temperature by 9am today was 23.5C (74F) in Porthmadog, Gwynedd,
 while it was 26.1C (79F) by 11am in Achnagart in Inverness-shire.

Tonight
 will see any isolated sharp showers across the South West fade away, 
leaving a dry night across the UK with clear skies for most.

Tomorrow will be dry and fine for 
most, but a few scattered heavy and locally-thundery showers could break
 out in the South in the afternoon.

There
 will be showers in Scotland on Saturday, with a few possible across 
Wales and the South West - but other parts of England will be dry and 
sunny.

The south coast will have the best beach 
destinations for warm weather, with 26C (79F) on Saturday from Poole, 
Dorset, along to Newhaven, Sussex.

The 2014 UK high was set last Friday 
in Kent at 32.3C (90F) - while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all 
set their own 2014 records yesterday.

This
 weekend around 295,000 passengers will be departing from London 
Gatwick, 140,000 from London Stansted and 79,000 from London Luton.

More
 than 100,000 will be leaving from Scottish airports with 50,000 from

And
 research from Kwik-Fit showed that British families will rack up a 
total of 15.7billion miles in their own cars during holidays this year.

Motorists
 in the West Midlands plan to travel the greatest distance in their own 
cars, with expected average mileage of 1,322 miles.

Looking forward, Billy Payne, a forecaster with 
Meteogroup, said August ‘should get off to a fairly dry and settled 
start’ with a build-up of high pressure.

He
 added that next week will bring a slight drop in temperatures but highs
 of 23C (73F) were still possible in the South on Monday.

Meanwhile
 a graphic from forecasters MetDesk showed what it called a ‘classic 
blocking weather pattern’ leading to beautiful conditions for Britain.

Brendan
 Jones, the company's forecast manager, told MailOnline: ‘The 
jet-stream, a ribbon of fast-moving wind high in the atmosphere, 
controls where areas of low pressure track across the Atlantic. These 
areas of low pressure bring with them cloud, wind and rain.

'The jet-stream looks set to dive southwards into Ireland and then across the UK this weekend, and thus it’s likely to become cooler and wetter in the north on Saturday, and then in the south on Sunday'

Brendan Jones, MetDesk forecast manager

'When the jet-stream is diverted to the north of the UK, the low pressure systems are diverted with it. This often allows areas of high pressure to build across the UK and high pressure often results in dry, sunny conditions with light winds.

‘The current position of the jet-stream is displayed on the graphic as areas of pink shading, showing how it is passing well to the north of the UK and allowing high pressure to build over much of northern Europe.

‘The jet-stream looks set to dive southwards into Ireland and then across the UK this weekend, and thus it’s likely to become cooler and wetter in the North on Saturday, and then in the South on Sunday.

‘We’re then likely to see the jet-stream closer to the UK through next week compared with recently, and thus there’ll be a greater potential for showers and breezier weather.’

This summer’s heatwave has boosted the happiness of Britons by 25 per cent, research claimed today.

The study found the glare of the sun waking us up, commuting in the warm weather and wearing less clothing have seen our stress levels drop.

The research also revealed three quarters of us feel healthier during the hot spell due to being more active and eating lighter foods such as salads.

Sporting a hint of a tan, leaving work on time and the prospect of our annual holiday also means we have higher spirits in the summer months,

One in five also said they get up much earlier and have a more positive approach to life, according to the poll for Garnier Ambre Solaire.

A spokesman for the brand said: ‘This research shows how the sunshine can give everyone a much-needed boost.

‘Living in Britain, we all get used to the cold winters and rainy days, so as a nation we all probably get over-excited at the first sign of summer.'

Making the most of it: People enjoying the sunshine at lunchtime in the City of London as the warm weather continues

The poll also found everyday tasks are better experiences in the summer - with driving, shopping and even working all being listed.

Two thirds of adults said they were happier in the hot weather, and half said they were more cheerful and relaxed.

A quarter said they had a lot more motivation and 14 per cent said they were fitter.

In fact, eight in 10 Brits said their mood is instantly lifted as soon as they know it’s going to be a nice day.
