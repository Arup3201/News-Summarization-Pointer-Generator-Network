A stunning set of images showing what it is really like to be a child in the circus have been revealed. 

The photographs capture both the banality of being backstage and the excitement of putting on a show - from a young boy having his hair tidied by his grandmother to a three-year-old snake tamer showing an audience how it's done.

The beautiful shots were taken by photographer Francisco Salgueiro in Portugal.

The 47-year-old visited 25 circuses over 70 times as he documented life behind the big top.

'Although I have visited all the circuses that operate in Portugal, this is an ongoing project because every time I visit a circus there is always a new story to be told,' he told Wired.com.

After Ivan's grandmother tidies his hair he takes to the stage and juggles in the background of one set, dressed in a red and gold waistcoat and wearing a crisp, white shirt

Three-year-old Dasi is a snake tamer. She races round and shows a small yellow snake to an avid audience during one show while she wears a red, embellished dress

Cassandra, 11, performs several acts  including being a clown where she dresses in baggy chequered trousers and large red shoes. She also helps to sell lightsabers during the intermission

Cassandra also acts as a snake tamer and goes around the audience in her sparkly blue outfit showing the young crowd snakes and serpents with her bare hands

One child, wearing only goggles and a dark t-shirt, is brave enough to jump through fire while a woman  looks on with her hands on her hips

Backstage provides a place where performers can gather their thoughts. Deisy (right) is running through her moves in her head before she takes to the stage for the first time 

Nereida, five, peeks round the edge of a heavy curtain to try and catch a glimpse of her father, who is sat in front of a mirror, during his show

The circus must move between Portuguese towns. Children play inside the big top and are oblivious to the hard work of their parents as the tent is slowly taken down for the move

Due to moving between towns a lot it is common for children to sleep over at different circuses because all of their friends live there. Three friends are pictured above chatting away on their mobiles as they sit at a caravan door 

A young clown, wearing yellow chequered trousers and a huge red nose, sleeps between sets on a plastic chair surrounded by elaborate costumes 

The 'strongest man in the world' waits in costume next to his weights on brown grass. Two girls stand outside their caravan trying to find something to do between shows

Two of the circus owner's children (right) go to bed in a tiny caravan that is also being used as a base for audio and video control. They are just feet away from a man with a painted face who works hard through the night to ensure everything goes smoothly 

From an early age the circus children create a very close relationship with the animals they work with, including this horse above, and do their best to treat them with respect 

Two boys race around the dirty outskirts of the 'Brasil' circus on bikes while their parents work inside the boundary

In Mr Salgueiro's experience small children are often not left alone and instead have to stay in ticket booths and other areas while their parents perform during the evenings 

Bruce, four, stuffs his face with candy-floss while sat on a fridge as his mother performs upside-down with a football on the stage just metres away

The children are so used to exotic animals that they barely pay attention to them - even when one of their fathers is trapped in a tank with a shark

One of the famous Hermanas Dias, dressed in a red, black and green sequinned onesie, prays before going on stage to climb up a ten-metre set of stairs

Twins, Deisy and Ivan, nine, practice jumps on a small trampoline outside a caravan so they can perfect them for one of their shows

Mr Salgueiro has visited the regional circuses well over 70 times so he can document circus life - taking photos whether it's sunny or raining

Artist Aniana Torralvo has to use a computer to do the audio and visual parts of her show while she is not performing, even with her little child in her arms

In small circuses everyone does a bit of everything. The young boy above takes care of the animals, makes popcorn and is also a clown during the show

During the summer, where the temperature increases to above 30 degrees, children fill up paddling pools in the spaces between caravans 

Cassandra, 11, helps her sister, who is in charge of the audio-visual elements of the show, while wearing a dressing gown

Ruben, 11, is one of the young boys who swims with piranhas in a tank. When he is finished his mother is on hand to help him to get out of the tank and get some air

Even in the breaks between shows housework has to be done very quickly. Pictured above is a young girl washing clothes in the back of a van 

A living room and children's bedroom, complete with pink duvet and large wolf toy, has been built inside this RV so the family can still have their own spaces 

A young girl peeks out of the window of her caravan while she waits for her moment to go on stage, which is behind her in a big red tent

Nereida, one of the youngest serpent tamers in the circus, stands outside with a donkey and a snake round her neck 

Artists are simultaneously popcorn and lightsaber sellers. Mothers also have duties to do, even if they are performing during one of the late night shows

Despite their unusual lifestyles the circus children have access to the internet - and like every child they are all very technologically savvy 

Jennifer Costa kisses her three-year-old son before going on stage. It is one of the only moments of peace before her hectic show
