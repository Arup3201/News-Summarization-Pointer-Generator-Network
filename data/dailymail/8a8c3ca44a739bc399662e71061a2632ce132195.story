A thief appears to have been caught red-handed stealing from a fashion boutique after the store's owner took the bold step of posting footage of the alleged crime on Facebook.

Shop owner Robyn Boyd was so outraged when she discovered four items were missing from her women's clothing store in Adelaide that she filmed CCTV footage of a woman appearing to stuff clothes into her bag and shared it online.

'Here is 3 minutes worth of yesterday thief! She stole 4 items in total! Please like and share! We want to find her! [sic],' she wrote on Facebook on Saturday.

Red-handed? A boutique owner shared footage of another woman taking dresses of their hangers

The almost four minutes of footage, filmed at the Liberty Boutique store in Unley Shopping Centre, in the inner-southern suburb of Adelaide, has been shared over 1000 times so far.

A dark haired woman can be seen looking up at the shop's security camera as she moves between a few clothing racks outside the store's entrance.

At one point she takes a long multi-coloured dress of a hanger, puts the hanger back on the rack and folds the dress up as she turns her back to the camera.

Some people questioned why she didn't stop the thief, as in the video Robyn seems to be filming the incident on her phone.

But she explained she had filmed the CCTV footage on a screen on her mobile so that she could post it online.

When asked why nobody stepped in she also said:'Unfortunately the staff member was working alone, and was preoccupied with loyal & paying customers in the store, who she was helping.

'The woman was in and out within 3-4 minutes with the garments - not once stepping foot inside the store. The other camera angles show that she was keeping an eye on the staff member.

'Unfortunately you cannot trust anyone these days, and the staff member was doing the right thing by assisting other customers who needed her help.'
