A chorus of naysayers is emerging with predictions that President Obama's plan to 'degrade and destroy' the ISIS terror group will fail unless he abandons his pledge that avoid a ground war in Iraq and Syria.

Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that 'there is no way around it.'

'American boots will be standing on sand,' he told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute. 'Americans will be shot at, and they will be shooting back. There is simply no other way to do this.'

Obama has already sent more than 1,600 military personnel into Iraq, but the White House and Pentagon refer to them as 'advisers' and 'security forces,' not soldiers.

Air power alone won't get the job done in Iraq and Syria, argued House Armed Services Committee chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican 

Pledge: President Barack Obama said Wednesday that America ground troops would not be fighting ISIS

'These American forces will not have a combat mission.' he president said during a prime-time speech Wednesday night. 'We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment.'

As the numbers of airstrikes and boots on the ground continue to rise, experts are wondering whether 'mission creep' will force Obama – sooner rather than later – to repeat the strategies of President George W. Bush, which he forcefully campaigned against in 2007.

McKeon acknowledged that 'it is dangerous any time we have our sons and daughters take to the skies, the seas, or the shores to defeat an enemy.' But 'the only thing more dangerous is waiting.'

He told the Orange County Register on Monday that the president should 'err on the side of more [troops] rather than less.' But he said successfully beating back ISIS wouldn't require tens of thousands of armed American combatants. 

'This will take troops,' he said Thursday. 'It will not take divisions.'

An army division consists of between 10,000 and 20,000 soldiers.

The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Obama's leading generals presented him with a plan this week that called for U.S. troops going into ground combat. 

U.S. Middle East commander Gen. Lloyd Austin advised the White House to 'send a modest contingent of American troops, principally Special Operations forces, to advise and assist Iraqi army units in fighting the militants,' the Post reported, citing two unnamed military officials.

The word 'assist' is key. That would have involved embedding American soldiers with Iraqi government troops as they engaged ISIS and took fire.

Obama ultimately decided to send 475 servicemen and women to Iraq, solely as advisers for training, intelligence and equipment. 

Writing under a pen name, a Defense Department official told The Daily Caller on Thursday that 'in both Iraq and Syria, the United States lacks a reliable, legitimate ground force that it can support with air strikes in order to defeat the Islamic State.'

Obama's plan for airstrikes combined with support for Iraqi forces and the Free Syrian Army, the official said, 'is a foolish strategy that is unlikely to succeed.' 

ISIS, short for the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, has mounted a fearsome campaign of terror and mass-murder across about half of the combined territories of Iraq and Syria. 

The group aims to establish a global caliphate that would enforce a hard-line variation of Islam called Shariah law. It has already threatened to mount direct attacks in U.S. cities.  

Retired Gen. David Petraeus, who led the Iraq 'surge' of U.S. troops in 2007, cautioned on Thursday that the U.S. shouldn't 'overestimate' the strength of the terror group's standing army.

'ISIL in Iraq should not be overestimated,' he said in Denver during a speech about the 9/11 commemoration.

'This, in many respects, is a – it has nowhere near the roots, the numbers, and the structure that al-Qaeda in Iraq and the associated Sunni insurgents had' before the surge, he said.

But the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency now estimates that ISIS may have as many as 31,000 fighters at its disposal.

ISIS 'can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, based on a new review of all-source intelligence reports from May to August,' CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said in a statement. 

The group's Syria contingent includes 15,000 foreign fighters – including 2,000 from Western nations.

Those numbers are making some experts doubt that it can be defeated by airstrikes alone.

Larry Johnson, a former CIA analyst and State Department counter-terrorism official, told The Washington Times that avoiding a ground game made Obama's strategy 'a waste of time.'

ISIS 'is an army,' he said. 'The air power is not going to get the job done. Until you put troops in and kill these guys, they're going to continue.'

An unnamed U.S. Army officer echoed McKeon's caution that a mid-sized contingent could get the job done.

'Air power alone cannot win wars,' the officer told the Times. '[Obama's] stated strategy ignores this widely accepted truth. But with troops on the ground, in very small numbers, we can team with Kurds and Shia to support those ground forces in rapidly defeating ISIS.'

Retired Army General John Keane added that defeating the terror group 'requires a ground counteroffensive to retake lost territory.' His preference, however, would be to continue the current effort 'led by the Iraqi army and the Free Syrian Army [and] supported by close air support.'
