A tech executive is suing Craigslist after an anonymous user posted a message on the site claiming he was a serial cheater and asking readers to inform his girlfriend via a listed email address.

In the post, the user allegedly accused John Goullet, 53, an executive in the IT staffing firm Diversent,  of sleeping with 'dozens of women', including some younger than his own children.

Claiming to be a friend of Mr Goullet's long-term partner, Theresa Olguin, they explained how they could not inform her of her boyfriend's betrayal themselves 'because we have people in common'.

Instead, they asked readers to tell Miss Olguin - and provided her email for them to do so, it is said.

'I cannot tell her because we have people in common. She deserves to know while he is screwing dozens of women even younger than his own kids,' the user explained on the classified ads site.

Following the posting - titled, 'Please tell my friend her boyfriend is cheating' - Miss Olguin allegedly received an email from a reader named Adam, accusing Mr Goullet of repeatedly cheating on her.

The 49-year-old wardrobe stylist, who has been with Mr Goullet for three years, was also sent a mysterious letter at her Trump Place apartment in New York last April, the New York Post reported.

According to court papers, the letter read: 'I know you have been with John for awhile. I feel you should know that I have seen him with another woman several times... It is not platonic.'

Mr Goullet, who lives in New Jersey, founded Info Technologies in 1994, before growing it into a $30million operation and eventually merging it with another firm to create Diversant Inc.

He has denied the allegations, saying that they are false and malicious. In the lawsuit, he states Craigslist should be forced to reveal the identity of the user who posted the cheating claims.

Speaking to The Post, he said: 'It’s a private matter and I don’t want any attention given to it.'

Mr Goullet, a Ursinus College graduate, and Miss Olguin are believed to still be together.
