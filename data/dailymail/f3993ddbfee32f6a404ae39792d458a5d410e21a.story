Two top £11,000-a-year independent schools have sparked outrage among parents by organising a Christmas trip to west Africa – just 400 miles from the deadly Ebola zone where even doctors have decided it is too dangerous to visit.

Teachers are facing a backlash from parents after arranging the trip to The Gambia for 25 pupils from Cheadle Hulme School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and Withington Girls' School, in Fallowfield, Manchester.

Parents are now urging the school to 'see sense' and cancel the week-long excursion, which costs £700 per pupil, branding it 'unnecessary' and 'very dangerous'.

The trip, organised by the geography department at Cheadle Hulme, is planned to give youngsters an insight into the country's way of life – but The Gambia is situated just a few hundred miles from the main concentration of the Ebola outbreak.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the worst affected areas to be hit with Ebola, where the death toll has reached almost 7,000. In total, more than 16,000 have been affected in the three countries alone since the worst outbreak of the deadly virus on record began 12 months ago.

With 500 new cases reported in west Africa each week, parents have expressed concern about sending schoolchildren to an area where they could become infected.

Dr Magdi Hanafy, a leading surgeon whose daughter was due to go on the field trip, has urged the 1,400 pupil school to cancel the trip after he and an international group of leading medics postponed a humanitarian medical mission to nearby Ghana because of the epidemic.

The 58-year-old and his wife Sue, 45, are also vowing to keep their 17-year-old daughter Laura away from school for the incubation period of 21 days if her classmates go on the trip.

Father-of-two Dr Hanafy, who has alerted the Department of Health and the Department of Education of his concerns, said: 'There is no necessity or vital need for the trip.

'In normal circumstances, yes, The Gambia is a good experience for them, but in abnormal circumstances why would you take the risk?

'The whole of west Africa is very dangerous and for the school to feel they are safe is naive.

'Even if they are safe they will be able to transmit diseases which could affect the community on their return.

'This is not only about my daughter it's about what will happen when they come back. They need to see sense.'

Dr Hanafy, based at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, has been a consultant surgeon for almost 20 years and is a member of Hernia International, a group which annually travels  to deliver self-funded humanitarian  surgery in poverty-stricken African nations.

He and a team made up of English, Canadian and German medical professionals were due to travel to Ghana this month to perform free surgery on patients suffering with hernias in the country, but were forced to cancel the trip over Ebola fears.

The school field trip is the ninth biennial trip to The Gambian High School, which last year featured the opening of new school buildings, new wells and a village soap making business.

Dr Hanafy met teachers to discuss his concerns regarding Ebola but was told staff had received advice from Public Health England saying it was safe to travel to The Gambia.

He added: 'In those countries there are no borders - nothing in the terms we understand here.

'People just walk around. The decision was based on the presentation the school had and I was possibly the only one who opposed the idea and on a show of hands many who agreed with going were students.

'It's an irresponsible decision for something so trivial. They could go next year or go somewhere else.

'They could go outside Africa - money is not an issue, whether we get that back or not. Our decision to postpone the aid trip wasn't taken lightly.

The Ebola death toll currently stands at 6,928, according to the World Health Organisation, with the total number of people infected having surpassed 16,000 in West Africa. Pictured: Health workers in Liberia

The health agency had launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by December

December 6, 2013 - Ebola claims the life of its first victim in Guinea, thought to be a two-year-old from a remote village. The toddler, scientists believe was patient zero, suffered a fever, black stools and vomiting.

March 25, 2014 - The Guinean authorities report the outbreak to the World Health Organisation after diagnosing the virus as Ebola. By this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to Guinea.

May 2014 - It appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing, as the death toll tailed off.

May 2014 - A very well-known woman from Guinea, a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus, Professor Piot said. Hundreds of people attended her funeral, travelling from three countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Dozens were infected and the disease spread across Guinea's southern border to both neighbouring nations.

July 2014 - The virus crossed into Nigeria as Liberian man Patrick Sawyer died en route back to the US. He had been at the funeral of his sister, who died of Ebola.

August 8, 2014 - The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

'We already had our visas and 40 boxes of medication. My daughter is too upset about not going to understand the danger and to understand we are protecting her.'

His wife Sue added that the school was 'gambling' by continuing with the trip despite the deadly outbreak.

She said: 'When Ebola erupted we changed our minds on the trip because there are a lot of unreported cases in African countries.

'We know they say there is no travelling between the three affected countries but that doesn't interest me because a lot of African people walk across the border.

'You can't guarantee it isn't there. The school said "if you don't want your children to go, that's fine, but the trip will go ahead".

'I tried to explain that the risk doesn't stop there and there needs to be a 21 day incubation period. I'm really not happy because what if any child catches the virus, how do you know?

'Even if they go and come back and nobody contracts the virus I will still be disappointed in them because they are gambling. They still took the risk.'

Sarah Cookhill, whose daughter goes to nearby Manchester High School, has also expressed fears for the community as pupils from fee-paying Withington Girls' School are also due to go on the trip.

She said: 'Manchester High School get on the same bus as Withington Girls', so everybody is concerned.

'There's just no sense for the school trip to carry on with the risk involved. If it is going ahead surely the children should be kept away for 21 days afterwards.

'For the sake of a school trip it seems an absolute farce. Either people are downright stupid or they're happy gambling with safety.'

There are 500 new cases of Ebola (above) reported in west Africa each week, according to the health agency

Founded in 1855, Cheadle Hulme School charges more than £3,500 per term and boasts BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson and newsreader Katie Derham among alumni.

Headteacher Lucy Pearson said despite a small number of pupils choosing to withdraw from the trip, it would still be going ahead.

She said: 'Cheadle Hulme School has a rigorous Risk Assessment procedure for every trip which takes place, taking into account the distinct circumstances of each visit.

'We have followed guidance from Public Health England, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Liverpool School for Tropical Medicine and the UN in carrying out the Risk Assessment for the forthcoming biennial trip to The Gambia, taking into consideration the specific concerns which some parents have regarding travel in west Africa at the current time.

'The official advice given indicates that the trip is safe to go ahead.

'We have held a special meeting with parents to explain, share and discuss this advice, understanding their continuing apprehensions, and gave parents and students the choice as to whether they still wished to continue taking part.

'A small number have chosen to withdraw yet all families bar one are happy for the trip to continue.'
