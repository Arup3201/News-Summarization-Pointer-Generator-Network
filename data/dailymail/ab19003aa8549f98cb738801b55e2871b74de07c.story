A brain-damaged man accused of starting a 1996 fire at an Ohio fireworks store that killed nine people died earlier this month at a mental health facility.

Todd Hall died March 8 in Athens where he had been getting treatment for the last several years, according to the Lawrence County Prosecutor's Office.

A cause of death for the 43-year-old couldn't be immediately confirmed Monday. 

Suspect: Todd Hall, center, miles before leaving court in Ironton, Ohio (2002 file photo).  Hall was accused of starting a 1996 fire at an Ohio fireworks store that killed nine people

Hall, of Proctorville, was 24 when prosecutors say that, as a prank, he threw a lighted cigarette on a shelf crammed with fireworks at the Ohio River Fireworks store in Scottown, about 100 miles southeast of Cincinnati. 

The blaze on July 3, 1996, killed nine people and eleven people were injured.

Five of the victims were from Ohio; the four others were from nearby West Virginia.

According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old

The Daily Independent reported that victims included 24-year-old Ryan Aldridge; 3-year-old Shelbi Cron; 21-year-old Misti Cron, 31-year-old Candy Lee, 14-year-old Matt Sansom, 8-year-old Ona Tolliver, 34-year-old Floyd Tolliver, 9-year-old Jason Wallace, and 71-year-old Kathlene Wilks. 

According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. 

Charged with aggravated arson and nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, he repeatedly was ruled incompetent to stand trial in the years since then.

In recent years, he had shown severe impairments in his ability to control his behavior, regulate his mood and take care of himself and was deemed incapable of living outside a facility, according to the last court-ordered evaluation a few years ago. 

The Daily Independent reported that Hall giggled and sang the Star-Spangled Banner in court. 

Authorities initially thought three friends challenged Hall to set the fire, but they all passed polygraph tests and were never charged. About 40 people were in the store at the time and ran for the exits when fireworks started going off.
