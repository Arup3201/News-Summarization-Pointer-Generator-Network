Twelve countries, five continents and 41,000 miles of pure luxury - if you've ever wondered what kind of holiday £1million would buy, this is it.

Luxury travel specialists Destinology are offering an outrageously opulent trip for two adults includes first class travel and accommodation in a selection of the world's most luxurious hotels and island resorts.

With an average cost of just over £11,900 per night, the dream trip is among the most expensive in the world.

Beginning with first class flights from London Heathrow to Dubai, guests will stay in the Royal Bridge Suite, Atlantis at The Palm for five nights – complete with a private chef, butler and  view of the Arabian Sea.

World-class hotels such as the One & Only Hayman Island Resort, The Langham Auckland, Rolling Stones' favourite Palazzo Versace in Brisbane, Coco Prive Kuda Hithi Private Island, the One & Only Cape Town and in the Maldives also feature on the itinerary.

The most expensive stop is the £25,000 per night Ty Warner Penthouse at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York, which features panoramic views of New York's skyline and interiors designed by renowned architect I. M. Pei.

Privacy is paramount, and there will be no other guests on the three private flights, two private islands, or private guest villa which customers will enjoy during the 84 days. 

Flying from New York to Barbados in a private jet, the holiday ends with a seven night luxury stay at The Great House, Turtle Beach, where guests can enjoy tropical gardens and experience the local cuisine.

Dominic Speakman, CEO of Destinology, said: 'Our customers enjoy tailor-made, unique trips that offer them a memorable experience not available elsewhere.

'The £1 million holiday is exactly that – a once in a lifetime experience staying in some of the most luxurious and private resorts in the world, complete with first class or private jet flights. 

'I think it's safe to say no one, not even Phillias Fogg, will have been around the world in 80 days in such style before.'
