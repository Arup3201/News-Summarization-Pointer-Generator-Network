Another nine airports have been asked to install full body scanners, bringing the total up to 19.

The scanners, designed to stop terrorists using bombs not made of metal, will be put in at Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle airports, among others.

However starting today passengers are able to opt for a full body search by hand rather than a scan if they would prefer.

Nine more airports are to get full body scanners, including Newcastle, Liverpool and Bristol. Trials at Aberdeen and Stansted are also being made permanent

The transport secretary Patrick 
McLoughlin said: 'The overwhelming evidence from airports is that nearly
all passengers accept the use of security scanners and find the process
quick and convenient.

'However, I appreciate a small minority may still prefer to request an alternative procedure for a variety of reasons.'

The search would require items of clothing to either be loosened or removed, he added.

The other airports getting scanners will be Belfast City, Cardiff, East Midlands, Glasgow Preswick, Leeds Bradford, and Luton.

The original scanners, which produced a nearly-naked image (left) have been replaced with ones which only show a stick-figure with danger areas highlighted (right)

Trials of the scanners at Stansted and Aberdeen will also be made permanent, while airports that already have the scanners are being asked to think about installing more.

All of the scanners in the UK will also use millimetre wave technology, which is similar to x-ray but with no known health risks.

Since the security measure was introduced the technology has been upgraded so that officials checking the images are shown simple stick figures with danger areas highlighted, rather than a shadowy naked figure.

Previously anybody refusing a scan would be stopped from flying, but that will only happen now if they refuse both a scan and a search.

Defending the scanners' use, Mr McLoughlin pointed to an attempted attack in 2009 when a man tried to ignite a device by injecting it with liquid.

He also cited an incident in Yemen in 2012 when an explosive intended for an aeroplane was recovered before the United States-bound flight took off.

Neither of the bombs would have been detected using conventional metal detectors.
