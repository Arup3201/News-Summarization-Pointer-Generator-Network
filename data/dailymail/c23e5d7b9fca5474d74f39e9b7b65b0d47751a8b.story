Andrew Mitchell is facing financial ruin after losing his legal bid to cut his £3million bill for failed libel action - adding an extra £100,000 to his tab

Disgraced Tory MP Andrew Mitchell is facing financial ruin after losing a legal bid to cut his £3million bill for failed libel action - adding an extra £100,000 to his tab.

The former chief whip, 58, was found to have called police officers 'f****** plebs' when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate in 2012.

He sued The Sun for breaking the 'Plebgate' story, but the MP for Sutton Coldfield was then counter-sued for calling on-duty officer, PC Toby Rowland, a 'serial liar'.

Mr Justice Mitting described the MP's behaviour on the night as 'childish' and said his version of events was inconsistent with CCTV footage in a hearing last November.

Today the same judge rejected Mitchell's bid to reduce his overall bill after the MP tried to claim that he should only have gone against one legal team, rather than two at London's High Court.

The single day's hearing today cost a staggering £70,000 with News Group Newspapers' lawyers billing for £49,917 and PC Rowland's team £20,064.

Mitchell has already paid £300,000 in 'interim payments' to The Sun and PC Rowland following the trial.

His full bill will be analysed by a specialist costs judge on a date yet to be determined.

After losing the libel trial in November, the costs of the entire litigation were unofficially estimated at £3million. 

The former chief whip was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character and claimed that the allegations were a 'web of lies'.

He told the judge from the witness box: 'I would never call a policeman a pleb, let alone a f***ing pleb.' 

It emerged in court that Mitchell had been accused of a pattern of insulting and high-handed behaviour towards officials on at least 16 occasions dating back to 2005.

Mr Justice Mitting rejected arguments that Mitchell should only pay for PC Rowland's costs, rather than The Sun's as well.

James Price QC, for Mitchell, had argued his client should not pay for lawyers representing The Sun, as this was 'duplication' and 'not proportionate'.

He said: 'Did litigating this issue really require two [legal] teams?' 'There should have been only one team - end of story.'

Mr Price argued PC Rowland 'had the whip-hand' over The Sun, and could have arranged to argue the case alongside The Sun, rather than separately.

Desmond Browne QC, for PC Rowland, said, 'If there is any substance to this point, it should have been raised before the trial.'

Mr Browne said his team had gone to 'scrupulous pains' to avoid duplicating work, but could not have worked as one with The Sun, due to potential conflicts of interest.

Nicholas Bacon QC, a specialist costs lawyer representing The Sun, said 'the sensible course' was to have two separate legal teams for PC Rowland and the newspaper.

He accused Mr Price of 'a classic application of hindsight' and pointed out Mitchell's legal team had run up more costs than that of either The Sun or PC Rowland.

'It is Mr Mitchell who has not assisted the court here', he said, 'He did not attempt to use the budgeting process to his advantage, so the sympathy which the court has thus far tentatively expressed [for him] does need to be looked at in the light of our submissions'.

Referring to an offer to settle with The Sun in September last year, Mr Justice Mitting said, 'If Mr Mitchell had accepted that offer, then he would have got what he now in fact seeks.

'There would have been a trial of the preliminary issue between him and PC Rowland only. Only one set of costs would have been incurred and would have been paid by him, if - as was the case - he lost.'

He said lawyers for The Sun 'were entitled to protect their interests in any reasonable manner which they saw fit. They made an offer which would have eliminated all risks of adverse costs findings, both for themselves and Mr Mitchell, at the trial of the preliminary issue.'

Mr Justice Mitting refused to direct that Mitchell should only pay one of his opponent's costs, saying, 'Accordingly, I decline to make the expression or view I otherwise would.'

After deciding Mitchell had 'lost' the hearing, he ordered another interim payment of £25,000, to be split between The Sun and PC Rowland's legal teams.

Negotiations regarding damages due to PC Rowland continue, and a trial will be held if the matter cannot be agreed out of court.

Andrew Mitchell has been accused of high-handed behaviour at least 16 times dating back to 2005. Those outlined to the High Court included:

NOVEMBER 2005:Mr Mitchell tried to cycle through a heavy gate into Black Rod's garden as it was being closed by a security guard. Lee Bryer shouted 'stop' several times but the MP ignored his requests and cycled through.

Mr Bryer caught up with Mr Mitchell and asked him why he did not stop. Mr Mitchell allegedly said: I'm an MP and I'm too important to stop for you. Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.'

MAY 2011: The MP arrived at the main gate of Downing Street on his bicycle and told officers: 'Let me in. I'm a Cabinet MP and I'm late for a meeting.' PC Bruce Smart had no idea who he was so phoned the control room at No 10.

He said: 'The custodian told me that although allowing him access this way was against security policy, denying him entry would be more trouble than it was worth, and so I should just let him in.'

JUNE 2011: For a second time Mr Mitchell had a confrontation with PC Smart at the Downing Street gates – but this time the officer refused to let him through due to 'security reasons'.

When Iain Duncan Smith arrived by car the officers had to open the main gate. They finally allowed Mr Mitchell through after a polite request from Mr Duncan Smith. As Mr Mitchell cycled through, he allegedly said: 'Bruce Smart, is it? You shall be hearing about this. Don't think you've heard the last of this – I'm going to make a complaint to the Commissioner.'

The MP demanded full disciplinary proceedings be brought against PC Smart. The officer said: 'During both my encounters with Mr Mitchell his behaviour was arrogant and rude.'

JUNE 2011: PC Joseph Withington was on duty at Downing Street when Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted 'chop, chop' as officers opened the main gate for him.

The MP is then alleged to have said: 'Always helps if you do this as rapidly as possible – we're all in a hurry.' PC Withington told the court Mr Mitchell used a 'condescendingly rude tone', adding: 'It's completely unnecessary, patronising and sarcastic to be spoken to like that.'

AUGUST 3, 2011: When Mr Mitchell arrived in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia, during his stint as International Development Secretary, he told his protection team he wanted to travel to Libya.

Inspector Duncan Johnston, who ran the team, told him such a trip was not possible as it would breach international law. Mr Mitchell allegedly replied: 'That's a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.'

Inspector Johnston said he found this 'rather insulting, discourteous and demeaning'.

AUGUST 17, 2011: Two weeks later Mr Mitchell 'launched into a foul-mouthed tirade' at members of his protection team when a trip from Kenya to Somalia was changed for security reasons.

Inspector Johnston said: 'He used a tirade of language that … was just swearing for the sake of swearing.'

Mr Mitchell demanded to know how many officers had been sent to Kenya in advance of him and allegedly accused them of treating it as a holiday.

He allegedly said: 'British taxpayers are funding this for police officers to sit by the pool.'

EARLY SEPTEMBER, 2012: On one visit to Downing Street Mr Mitchell had to cycle through the pedestrian gate, rather than the main gate.

He shouted to officers: 'I'm coming through that gate next time.' PC Michael Penton said: 'I found Mr Mitchell's behaviour to be rude and condescending.'

SEPTEMBER 18, 2012: On the night before 'Plebgate', Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: 'I'm the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.'

PC Gareth Bonds said: 'During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing.

'I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell's tone overbearing.'
