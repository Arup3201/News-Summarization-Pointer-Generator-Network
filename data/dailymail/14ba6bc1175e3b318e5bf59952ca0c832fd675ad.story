Locked up: A house owned by O.J. Simpson, pictured in May, is going up for auction online

The lavish Florida home where O.J. Simpson lived for nearly a decade before heading to prison will be auctioned off online, it has emerged.

A Miami-Dade County judge signed off the deal on Wednesday, two years after JP Morgan Chase filed to foreclose the disgraced NFL star's four-bedroom four-bathroom home in Kendall.

The bank will take possession of the house on Tuesday and it will go on sale online on a auction website on October 29, the South Florida Business Journal reported.

He had stopped paying his mortgage in 2010 and owed the bank $892,283.11, including the $660,000-principal, fees, interests and court costs. He also owed four years in taxes, the judge ruled.

Simpson bought the 4,334-square-foot house, which also has a swimming pool, in 2000 for $575,000, but was financially 
destroyed by court orders related to his acquittal for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1997.

While he was found not guilty, he was found liable and a Los Angeles judge ordered him to pay $33.5 million for the wrongful death of Goldman. The families are still trying to collect the money.

After the ruling, he moved to Florida and bought the home as the state's laws protected a primary residence from being seized to pay off a civil judgment, RadarOnline reported.

Lavish: He has not paid the mortgage on the four-bedroom four-bathroom $500,000 home since 2010

He bought the home after other communities in Coral Gables and Coconut Grove rejected his purchase of other properties.

The property is currently assessed by the county's property appraiser's office at $481,000.

Simpson remains behind bars in Nevada after being convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas in 2008. But last month he was granted parole for some of the charges, and he could get parole for the other charges within the next 18 months.

Simpson had appeared before a two-member parole panel to plead for leniency, expressing regret for his actions and saying that he has been a model inmate.

The 66-year-old was handed down a harsh 33-year sentence for the charges stemming from the incident - a holdup of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel.

'I just wish I never went to that room,' he told the parole board last week. 'I with I just said keep it.'

'I missed my two younger kids who worked hard getting through high school, I missed their college graduations. I missed my sister's funeral. I missed all the birthdays.

'I promised prison officials I would be the best prisoner they have ever had here, [and] I think, for the most part, I've kept my word on that.'
