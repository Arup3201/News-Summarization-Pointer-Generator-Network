A nurse sent this selfie of himself clutching an axe to a 14-year-old girl he planned to have sex with, behead and eat, a court heard.

This picture taken in Dale Bolinger's bedroom in Kent was messaged to the girl 'Eva Gonza' on a website called the Dark Fetish Network.

The father-of-four bought the axe with a three foot handle from Homebase in Ramsgate on the day before he went to meet the 14 year-old.

Bolinger wrote in a chatlog with Eva: 'It's big enough. And very sharp. How wide is your neck then?'

The following day in September 2012 he went to Ashford International rail station in Kent expecting to meet the girl but she failed to turn up.

A jury heard his plan was uncovered by the FBI who found him chatting on the internet about rape, murder and cannibalism calling himself 'meatmarketman'.

His chatlogs also included boasts he had already eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five year-old child.

The Crown said Bolinger talked about how much more tender the meat is from children and got sexual gratification from his fantasies about cannibalism.

But Bolinger told Canterbury Crown Court he had never murdered or eaten anyone and his online boasts were pure fantasy. 

He said he thought of 14-year-old 'Eva Gonza' as a 'man, probably in his 40s, sitting in a room somewhere surrounded by pizza boxes'.

Denial: Bolinger is said to have told police his cannibalism was 'less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger' during an police interview conducted when he was first arrested in February last year

When asked about Eva, Bolinger said he was only 95 per cent sure she was not actually a 14-year-old girl.

'Someone was asking to speak to a real cannibal so I thought I could play that role,' he said.

'I wanted to shock her and was going to meet her fantasies and then take them to the extreme.'

Initially Bolinger told police the axe was to chop two trees in his garden. 

But he changed his story and told the court  he bought the axe for Eva.

'Initially, I was thinking about getting one and they were also on sale,' he said. 'She [Eva] said she wouldn't come unless I bought one. She pushed me and I pushed her. We fed off each other.'

When Bolinger was asked if he would like to act out a beheading in reality he said: 'No, not only would it be murder but it would be very messy.'  

The jury has heard that he has already pleaded guilty to an offence of administering a poison or noxious substance 'with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy' on a woman in July 2, 2010.

He is now on trial accused of 'attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming', which he denies.

The trial continues.
