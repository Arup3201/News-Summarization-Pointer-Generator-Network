Frank Warren has opened negotiations for Tyson Fury to challenge new world heavyweight champion sensation Deontay Wilder.

If this agreement can be reached quickly, Warren might even be prepared to pay step-aside money to Fury's scheduled opponent Christian Hammer in their European title defence at the O2 Arena on February 28.

Warren will probably seek to book either Wembley Stadium or the Millennium in Cardiff for what he calls 'the biggest and most exciting fight out there in the world today, apart from Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao'.

Warren has just revealed the long-running talks for Wladimir Klitschko to honour his mandatory defence against Fury for the other versions of the heavyweight crown still remain difficult.

Fury himself said: 'The ideal for me would be to beat Hammer, take the majority of those belts off Klitschko and then meet Wilder to become the undisputed champion. But if Wilder says he will fight me next, I will take that rather than hang about waiting for Wladimir.'

Warren believes that Wilder vs Fury would be an even bigger box office sensation than a fight with Klitschko. 

'Deontay has brought the heavyweight division out of the doldrums, and back to life. Him against Tyson would be the most exciting event to promote for me, bar none.

'The plan is still to pin down Klitschko and not let him duck Tyson but Wilder would be huge. Him and Tyson lead the heavyweight renaissance in 2015.'

Warren confirmed that he has begun talks with Wilder adviser Al Haymon's team, via transatlantic telephone and that 'it is very promising'.

He adds: 'With the greatest respect to Christian Hammer, if Wilder were to confirm this week I would pay him off. In a way it's a compliment, because we would have to ask ourselves, why take the risk?

'Why do that before the biggest income, the biggest live gate from a biggest TV heavyweight fight that could possibly happen? It will fill any football ground.' 

Hammer sounded convinced when he said 'people in Germany think I am mad, travelling over here to fight Tyson but I believe I could beat him on points'.

Fury says: 'I don't think anyone in this room thinks he can beat me any more than I could beat Usain Bolt in a 100metre sprint. But running is not heavyweight boxing in which one punch can cause a big upset.'
