'Happy Valentine’s Day. There you go sweetheart,' he yells during filthy protest

A scorned husband wreaked Valentine's Day revenge on his wife by dumping a  tractor-load of horse manure into her beloved convertible after discovering she was was cheating on him.

The furious spouse filmed the incident and placed it on YouTube, after finding his partner's profile on a dating website for people looking for love in rural Britain.

He made the discovery after his wife, who he names as Becky Jones, 37, from Lincolnshire, left her email account open on their computer and revealed she was trying to meet men behind his back.

Her profile on Kissinggates.com, a website for single farmers, admitted she has been married for five years but that her husband is 'a complete idiot' and 'completely crazy.'

Revenge: A cheating wife has received a Valentine's Day gift she won't forget - a tractor-load of horse manure in her beloved convertible

Note: The scorned man waves a belligerent note after his protest: 'Happy Valentines! (Don't 'muck around' with me.)

After hitting out at her husband, who she said 'doesn't know I'm on here', she said that she only loved two things - her car and her horse.

So in retaliation the unnamed husband picked up a load of faeces, probably from her horse, opened up the roof of her Peugeot, and dumped it all in there.

'Unfortunately for you, I have the keys to your lovely convertible Peugeot. Let's see how crazy I am,' he says.

Nobody from Kissinggates.com was available for comment today, prompting accusations that the site has set up the row as a publicity stunt.

The film, which does not make clear when it was filmed, starts with the husband explaining that he was checking his emails before making the heartbreaking discovery that his wife was on a dating website.

Hurt: Becky Jones, pictured, calls her husband a 'complete idiot' on the profile and admits they have been married for five years

Passionate: The woman says her two loves are her horses and her car in the profile, which sent her husband berserk

Profile: The amusing video shows him saving his wife's car keys and says 'let's see how crazy I really am'

He reads her profile out loud and that she is looking for 'discretion' from like-minded people she would like to meet for romance.

After waving the keys to her convertible in front of the camera it then cuts to him driving his tractor scooping up a mound of horse manure.

Shouting over the noise of the engine he then dumps the manure with gusto into her maroon car, filling it to the top.

'So just pick up from your favorite horse manure, and let’s see what we can do there.

'So here you go, just about to get around to see the beautiful Peugeot. Happy Valentine’s Day. Okay. There you go, sweetheart.

'That should show how crazy I am. Oh dear, her pride and joy. What do you think to that? Not very cool, is it.'

Digger: The video the cuts to him behind the wheel of the man's tractor as he scoops up giant pile of manure

Oh dear: He carries the muck across the farmyard and heads straight for the vehicle with its roof wide open
