Jimmy Savile may have sexually abused patients at more than 40 NHS hospitals, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed this morning.

Mr Hunt said the number of hospitals investigating allegations of abuse by the late DJ and TV star had been extended amid a slew of new sex abuse allegations.

In a Parliamentary statement today Mr Hunt revealed that since the NHS Savile Legacy Unit was established in June, new allegations had been made about alleged abuse at 12 hospitals - including nine which had not previously been caught up in the scandal.

Savile is thought to have abused patients aged from just five to 75.

The nine  hospitals which have not previously been embroiled in the scandal include: Birch Hill Hospital, Rochdale, Scott House Hospital, Rochdale, Bethlem Royal Hospital, South London, Shenley Hospital, North West London, West Yorkshire Ambulance Service, St Martin's Hospital, Canterbury, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, Meanwood Park Hospital, Leeds and Calderdale Royal Hospital, Huddersfield.

Investigations were already ongoing regarding similar claims concerning three of the 12; Leeds Infirmary, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle.

The Legacy Unit has passed information from victims and the Metropolitan Police to the relevant NHS trusts.

The fresh claims have emerged since 28 investigation reports into Savile's activities on NHS premises were published in June, Mr Hunt said in a written statement.

Outstanding reports, including an investigation into Stoke Mandeville Hospital, have been delayed until later in the year at the request of prosecutors, the Health Secretary added.

Earlier this week, the High Court heard the number of people intending to make claims after being sexually abused by the disgraced DJ has risen to more than 200.

Savile – who worked at the BBC, where he presented Top of the Pops and was a Radio 1 DJ – was disclosed to have been a predatory paedophile after his death at 84 in October 2011.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said new allegations of abuse at 12 hospitals had emerged 

There have been indications of legal claims against other organisations Savile had been associated with – the BBC, a number of NHS hospital trusts and the charities Barnardo's and Mind.

In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: ‘At the request of the Crown Prosecution Service, the publication of the NHS investigations into Jimmy Savile is being delayed until the conclusion of ongoing legal proceedings.

‘Therefore, I wish to advise the House that there will be a delay in the publication of the outstanding NHS investigation reports. We now hope trusts will publish their reports in January 2015.’
