On trial: Andrew Batchelor, dubbed the 'Menace of Mayfair', posed as a jeweller to con wealthy victims into handing over their jewellery

A 'charming conman' who posed as a high class jeweller to dupe his wealthy customers into handing over their valuables has been jailed for the third time.

Andrew Batchelor, 54, known as the 'Menace of Mayfair', tricked clients, including company directors and lawyers, into parting with more than £7,000 of jewellery, including Cartier bracelets and Rolex watches.

Some items were third generation family heirlooms.

Batchelor, who is also known as ‘Glasgow Goldfinger’ after running similar scams in Scotland, was jailed for five years in 2009 after pleading guilty to 29 charges, including 22 fraud offences, and banned from operating in the jewellery business.

Within months of his release last year Batchelor broke the conditions of the order by working in the trade, carrying out deals for three women, and by entering a pawn shop.

Batchelor has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years at Southwark Crown Court for what the judge called a series of ‘fundamental’ breaches’.

The judge, Mrs Recorder Emma Arbuthnot said: ‘Within five months of leaving prison in September 2011 you set up a website to deal in luxury goods such as handbags and luggage but the site also showed images of jewellery.

‘Inevitably this attracted interest from members of the public who had fallen on hard times and needed to raise money by selling their valuables.

‘You called your site Park Lane Vintage, it was based in the heart of Mayfair.

‘A least two of the women said this address gave them confidence you were a legitimate businessman.

‘What they did not know was that you had 35 previous convictions for defrauding innocent members of the public of their jewellery.’

Prosecutors branded Batchelor a ‘charming conman’ over a nine-day trial during which he was heard to have pawned one client’s jewellery to fund his own lifestyle after promising to sell it.

He claimed he intended to pay the woman by borrowing from his friends and family.

Antony Swift, prosecuting, said today: ‘That’s not a business. If he were to appear on The Apprentice like that Lord Sugar would have words with him.’

Batchelor’s defence counsel, Gregory King-Underwood said: ‘It is as if he lived some kind of fantasy life.

‘He had the expertise but he did not have the ability to run a business.

‘He was less motivated by malevolence against the individuals and more by the fantasy life which he led.’

Batchelor was also jailed in 1999 for similar cons in London and Glasgow.

In 1999 he was jailed for seven years - later reduced to five-and-a-half on appeal - for conning customers out of nearly £400,000 of valuables at his jewellery shop in Royal Exchange Square, Glasgow.

'Conman': Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Batchelor duped four victims into giving him their valuables for him to sell on their behalf

Prosecutor Antony Swift told a jury at Southwark Crown Court last week: ‘The defendant really is nothing more than a conman, a knowledgeable one, a charming on, but a conman nevertheless.’

He added: ‘In broad terms, we say the defendant is a fraudster, a conman, he cons people out of jewellery and watches in order to make a profit for himself and put other people at risk of loss.

‘He’s operated in that way in breach of a court order made in 2009 which is intended to prevent him from working in the jewellery business at all.’

The well-heeled fraudster was said to have wined and dined customers at top hotels before pawning or selling their possessions and pocketing the cash between February and June 2012.

Among Batchelor’s alleged victims was businesswoman and school governor Eva Lewis, who lost a Cartier bracelet and bangle to him after she turned to him desperate to raise funds.

She told the court he had treated her to lunch at London’s five-star Royal Garden Hotel before disappeared with gold jewellery worth more than £1,000.

The court heard police managed to recover the bracelet but the bangle is still missing.

Batchelor told jurors her had sold Mrs Lewis’s valuables as a ‘personal favour’.

Expensive: The conman duped customers into parting with Rolex watches.

The conman, from Bayswater, west London, was found guilty of two counts of failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order and had previously pleaded guilty to a third identical charge.

He was found not guilty of two counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation.

The jury were unable to reach verdicts on one count of failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order, one count of attempting to breach a Serious Crime Prevention Order, and one count of fraud by false representation.

He was sentenced to 30 months behind bars and ordered to pay £2,675 in compensation.

A new five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order was also imposed.

Detective Inspector Karl Amos of the MPS Lifetime Offender Management Unit said: ‘Batchelor clearly pays little regard to the criminal justice system. No sooner had he been released from prison than he was again setting up a false business in breach of the Serious Crime Prevention Order.

‘The early enforcement of the Serious Crime Prevention Order allowed the police to make an early and decisive intervention, limiting his ability to commit further crime and preventing further members of the public from losing their belongings.’
