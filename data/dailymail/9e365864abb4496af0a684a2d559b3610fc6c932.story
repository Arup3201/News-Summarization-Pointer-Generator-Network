Britain’s summer heatwave triggered a surge in spending as shoppers splashed out on food, alcohol and clothes.

Sales in July were 3 per cent higher than the same time last year, the biggest rise for two and a half years.

Consumer confidence was boosted by the hot weather, the birth of Prince George and sporting victories including Andy Murray winning Wimbledon and the rugby Lions triumphing in Australia.

Heatwave: As temperatures soared to over 30 degrees, shops saw a surge in sales

As temperatures hit 30 degrees in many parts of the country, families rushed out to stock up on barbecue essentials fuelling a 2.1 per cent year-on-year rise in food sales volumes.

This increase was the highest since April 2011, with the amount spent on food rising by 5.7 per cent.

‘Feedback from supermarkets suggested that the sunny weather boosted sales across a range of products including food, alcohol, clothing and outdoor items,’ the Office for National Statistics said.

Department stores saw July sales surge 3.1 per cent on a year earlier, while sales of textiles, clothing and footwear were up 1.4 per cent. Supermarkets also reported higher sales of garden furniture.

Property boom: House prices are rising three times fast than wages, and in many areas have returned to their highest level since the financial crash

It is the latest sign of a growing economic recovery after employment figures yesterday showed a record number of people are now in work, hitting 29.7million.

It follows a flurry of figures showing house prices at their highest level since the financial crash and manufacturing output and car production also on up.

From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013.

New Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.

In July, the average amount spent each week hit £7 billion, up from £6.8billion in June 2013 and £6.7 billion in July 2012.

Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said shoppers were ‘lured outside by the sunshine’.

He said: ‘With consumer confidence on the rise and continued growth in employment, the retail sector looks set fair for the third quarter, even as the boost from the weather fades.’

Month on month, there were dips in sales volumes across department stores and textile, clothing and footwear retailers, but supermarket sales grew 2.5 per cent.

James Knightley, economist at ING Bank, said the retail sales data suggests a ‘decent increase’ in GDP in the third quarter.

But he added that, with the economy also creating jobs, interest rate hikes are likely to come much sooner than late 2016 as implied by the Bank.

The data tallies with recent official figures which showed steep discounting by fashion retailers helped drive a drop in consumer price index (CPI) inflation, to 2.8 per cent in July from 2.9 per cent a month earlier.

And it suggests Britain's high streets are recovering after a weather-hit start to the year and five years of economic malaise.

Shoppers' migration to the internet continued, with the average weekly amount spent online rising 10.7 per cent to £586.6 million.

The amount spent online accounted for 9.5 per cent of all retail spending excluding automotive fuel.
