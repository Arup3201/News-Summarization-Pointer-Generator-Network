Volte face: Alexandra Swann has expressed doubts over Ukip's increasingly hardline stance on migration and will not campaign for them

A young politician hailed as the 'future face' of Ukip has sensationally announced she will not campaign for the party any longer because of its tough rhetoric on immigration.

Alexandra Swann, a former National Deputy Chairman of Conservative Future, defected from the Tories in 2012, claiming the party had lost its core values.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage personally announced her defection at Ukip's spring conference in Skegness that year.

But now she has expressed doubts over Ukip's increasingly hardline stance on migration.

Her political turnaround was unveiled after she told a presenter on Headline London, a current affairs show on TV station London Live, that she didn't want to be introduced as a member of Ukip.

'The focus moved to immigration. It was difficult with the anti-gay marriage stuff. Now so much of their argument is anti-immigration which didn’t sit well with me,' she said.

'I haven’t officially left or fallen out with anyone but I can’t bring myself to campaign for them,' she added, in an interview with The Independent.

She added that she feels immigrants should be given or denied residency in the UK based on their skill level, as opposed to their nation of origin. She has not, however, quit the party.

The staunch libertarian stood as a Ukip candidate for Farnham North in the Surrey County Council elections last May, but was narrowly defeated by the Tory incumbent, Denise Le Gal, by just 43 votes.

A Ukip spokesman would not comment.

A statement on her website outlines why she initially quit the Conservatives for Ukip.

It says: 'I left the Conservative Party because I no longer believe it is the party of freedom, aspiration, wealth creation and individualism; because I believe Cameron is doing to the Conservative Party what Gladstone did to the Liberals; because UKIP is the only party that promotes the values that originally led me to the Conservatives and because this "Conservative-led" government submits to every liberal-left piety imaginable.'

Her announcement comes as the party celebrates Farage's victory over Deputy PM Nick Clegg in two televised debates.

Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year’s General Election after his success in the televised clashes with Clegg.

A poll for The Mail on Sunday in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader is considering standing as an MP in 2015, shows he could easily win.

Asked by pollsters Survation if they would vote for Mr Farage as their MP, 33 per cent of people in Folkestone said yes, just three per cent less than those who said they would vote for sitting Conservative MP Damian Collins.
