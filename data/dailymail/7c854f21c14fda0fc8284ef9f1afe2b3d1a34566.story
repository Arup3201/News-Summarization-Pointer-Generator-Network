China's first school for butlers has opened in a sprawling upmarket villa - and it is run entirely by westerners.

The International Butler Academy offers £11,000-a-head courses to youngsters desperate to cash in on the rise of China's super-rich and the 'Downton Abbey effect'.

Recruits in smart three-piece suits are whisked through a punishing eight-week regime which includes shoe-shining, table-laying and pouring wine before working for the East's rising elite.

Students pay £11,000 to join the butler course to cater for China's new super-rich who love Downton Abbey

The eight-week course teaches students how to shine shoes and pour wine for the new billionaire Chinese

The International Butler Academy is located in a mansion in Chengdu China which opened for business in July

The academy opened in July at a multi-million pound villa in Chengdu, China, which has a swimming pool, two saunas and a bar.

Behind the idea was Dutchman Robert Wennekes, once a butler for 'one of America's wealthiest billionaires' who served as head butler for the U.S. Embassy in Germany.

The 56-year-old, whose firm already runs a similar school in a 14th Century castle in the Netherlands, is cashing in on the desire for western customs and traditions from the super-rich businessmen of cities like Shanghai.

Western butler training schools had already been sending many of their graduates overseas to Chinese families.

Students learn how to lay tables and travel to some of Europe's great homes to learn first-hand how its done

As well as learning all the skills to become a butler, the students are also given their uniform to star work 

Graduates of the academy can expect to earn anything between £30,000 and £90,000 a year 

Now the 'academy' claims to be the first permanent, accredited butler school in China - and it is proving popular.

Young recruits pay £10,900 for their eight-week course, which includes a full uniform, field trips to grand homes in Europe and all meals during the training.

The budding butlers learn how to set tables using rulers, polish silver forks and crystal wine glasses, iron tablecloths and pour wine for their masters.

When they graduate classes given by tutors from Canada, the U.S., Belgium and Switzerland, the academy claims they can expect to earn anywhere from £30,000 up to £90,000.

While the Eurozone is still struggling to pull out of the longest recession in its history, China's economy is growing by more than 7 per cent every year and shows little sign of slowing down.

Graduates are taught by tutors from Canada, the US, Belgium and Switzerland who have years of experience 

Students are taught that attention to detail is everything when it comes to serving in a great house 

With the Chinese economy growing on average by 7 per cent a year, there is a huge market for butlers 

A manufacturing boom and the relaxation of some of the Communist nation's state controls has led to a new generation of super-rich investors.

They splash out on opulent homes - often in wealthy areas of London - fast cars, and sending their children to England's top private schools and universities.

Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at SOAS University of London, said using western culture had a lot to do with status symbols.

'The fundamental reason for all this is that Chinese people now have the opportunity to distinguish themselves from other people in the country,' he told MailOnline.

'It started with the way people dress, then it was hobbies, then foreign travel - it's one thing after another.

'It's now accepted that China has become a class society, which is strange because it's still a communist country, at least in name.

Super-rich Chinese see television shows such as Downton Abbey and think that they now need a butler 

Female butlers are in great demand in the Middle East and the Far East due to cultural sensitivities 

The academy said it is the first accredited institution of its type in operation in China 

'They seek to emulate what they see to be upper class life in countries like the UK, U.S. and elsewhere. You could compare it with what the U.S. went through half a century ago when there was a lot of imitation.

'English literature from the Romantic era still has an enormous appeal and China has millions of fans of shows like Sherlock or Downton Abbey.

'It betrays a certain lack of confidence in one's own culture, but in time this will change.'

Despite the reputation of British butlers, Mr Wennekes insists the best now come from Switzerland.

The academy's website adds: 'The French invented the butler and the Americans invented the modern butler. Most butlers are employed in the U.S. and in the Middle East.'

There is another stereotype which is fast dying out - that 'butlering' is a profession reserved only for men.

If a candle is being reused it is vital that the wax drippings are removed with a razor blade to avoid offence 

Before any formal dinner it is important that the napkins are ironed with a military-type precision 

The International Butler Academy in China advertises itself 'by royal appointment' 

Buckingham Palace advertised for its first female butlers in 2004 and many of the students at the new school in China are women.

'Female butlers are sometimes preferred, especially for work within Middle and Far Eastern families where it may be culturally problematic for males to work closely with females in a household,' the academy said.

'Western female celebrities may also prefer a female butler, as may households where the wife is driving the decision to hire a butler.' 

A good butler should ensure that there are no water marks on the crystal and never the remains of lipstick 

Students at the academy are expected to work a 14-hour shift - preparing them for life with the super-rich 

Before starting work each morning the students must clean the entire house from top-to-bottom
