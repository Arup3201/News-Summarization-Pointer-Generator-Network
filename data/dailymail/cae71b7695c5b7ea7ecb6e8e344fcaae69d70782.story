It's Sunday night, you're settling down to watch Dancing On Ice and hopefully see some witty banter from the judges.

So what does one judge have to say about the skaters? 'Across the ice and the Samaritans and speedo you.'

Or how about, 'Right is affecting their partnership. Pulled your ball up.'

These are just some of the strange subtitles that have appeared on the show.

And now, the National Deaf
Children's Society has slammed ITV for its 'bizarre and confusing'
captioning on the hit celebrity figure skating contest.

Presenter Phillip Schofield tells it like it isn't, to contestants such as Jennifer Ellison and Jorgie Porter

The programme has
attracted an audience of more than 7million but deaf viewers are outraged by
nonsensical wording claiming 'blasphemous' routines 'walk
straight in the fridge'.

Leading
campaigners who want a good quality of life for deaf adults and children said incoherent subtitles makes second-class citizens out of disability sufferers.

Campaigns officer
Ian Noon at the NDCS said: 'Shoddy subtitling shows that broadcasters are
not making access for deaf viewers a priority.'

Presenters
Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield usually give a polished turn but appeared
to fluff their lines when talking about contestants including Jennifer Ellison and
Jorgie Porter.

'They will
be toasted to the limits,' claimed This Morning presenter Phillip.

See, skaters? That's where you're going wrong. Good job you pulled your ball up

Muscle-bound Chico Slimani reveals the secret to his success on the ice with partner Katarina Witt

Could you say that one more time please, Phillip...?

At one point, Louie Spence - judge and dance teacher to
the stars - admitted he does 'do occulta diagrams'.

Meanwhile, muscle-bound
Chico Slimani has said on the show that the secret to his success on the ice with partner
Katarina Witt is an 'ageing achievement'.

Skating legend
Christopher Dean is an expert on the rink and performing routines to Olympic
gold medal standard - but the subtitles portray him as a confused amateur.

'The jump
just walk straight in the fridge. It's Sebastian and Brianne,' he
exclaimed.

Viewers can also
vote 'at the end of the shop' for their favourite ice-skating star.

Mr Noon added: 'Deaf young people all too frequently find that the subtitles for their
favourite shows are riddled with mistakes and hugely out of sync with speech.

'There's no
excuse for poor subtitles like this - even on live programmes. But ITV is not
the only channel guilty of bizarre and confusing subtitles.'

'Through
basic planning such as involving the subtitler in rehearsals and sharing
scripts and plans in advance, broadcasters could dramatically improve live
television for deaf viewers.'

Mr Noon also
revealed that ITV have been caught out before for their poor subtitling and he
secured a commitment to improve them on X Factor in 2010.

Explanation? An ITV spokesman said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster'

'After a
series of emails highlighting complaints from young people, ITV agreed that the
subtitles on X Factor were not of a good standard,' added Mr Noon.

'Now I
believe the production team send off a near-final edit of the programme the day
before which should improve the quality of the subtitles.

'ITV also
claimed they had committed to making sure that the repeats of the programme
have high-quality subtitles.'

Despite being a
heavily scripted live programme, the popular talent show - which puts celebrity
amateur skaters with professionals - has bizarre and out-of-context wording.

An ITV spokesman
said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live
subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster.

'We are now
also subtitling 70 per cent of the programmes on ITV Player, our on-demand
catch-up service.'

The drive to
improve the quality of subtitles for deaf viewers has been led by Action on Aid
who were formerly called the Royal National Institute for the Deaf.

An Action on
Hearing Loss spokesman said: 'We urge all broadcasters to monitor the
quality of their subtitling to ensure high standards and invest in technology
to reduce mistakes.

'We would
also like Ofcom to play a greater role in monitoring subtitling complaints and
we have called for new laws to ensure the provision of subtitles on all
programmes, regardless of whether it is traditional or catch-up TV.'

Meanwhile, at the blundering BBC...

The
BBC came under fire last October from groups for the hard of hearing for its 
increasing number of bizarre gaffes, which have included calling the 
Labour leader 'Ed Miller Band' and the Church of England leader the 'arch 
bitch' of Canterbury.

The 
blunders are understood to be caused during live events where either a 
stenographer types words phonetically or by speech recognition.

This sees a person talking into a 
microphone as they observe the broadcast and a computer then changes 
what they are saying to subtitles.

Error: This subtitle 'willies/wellies' mistake on BBC Breakfast became an internet sensation when an eagle-eyed viewer posted the shot, describing pigs, online last year

During the Queen Mother’s funeral, a solemn call for silence became ‘we will now have a moment’s violence’.

When
a BBC announcer revealed the Government was ‘making helpful decisions’,
deaf viewers would have been left wondering why politicians were 
‘making holes for surgeons’.

A report that mentioned pigs on a farm nibbling on ‘wellies’ became something much ruder.

One politician talking to the Daily 
Politics told presenter Andrew Neil was subtitled as saying he did not 
believe in ‘soliciting’ himself when what he actually said was 
‘shortlisting’.

Other gaffes have seen the Ireland rugby team renamed as Island and the sale of millions of 
puppies in Britain was not about the trade in live dogs but actually a 
story about people wearing poppies for Remembrance Day. 

The errors have become so common they have spawned their own dedicated website.

The BBC is the only broadcaster in the world that subtitles all of its programmes.

Groups for the deaf and hard of hearing 
have admitted they receive regular complaints about the issue and called
on broadcasters to monitor the ‘quality of their subtitling’ and reduce
mistakes'.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We recognise 
that  subtitling it a hugely important service, and we endeavour to 
ensure it is as accurate as possible.

‘There are occasions, particularly 
during live broadcasts, when mistakes will happen but we do all we can 
to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to improve 
accuracy.’
