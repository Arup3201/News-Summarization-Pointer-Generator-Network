New regulations from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) allowing Australian domestic airline passengers to use electronic devices from gate-to-gate are soon to be approved.

CASA's call for revised submissions already has Australian airliners cheering, including Virgin and Qantas which began pursuing the changes long ago.Â 

The changes could see passengers able to use smartphones and tablets weighing up to 1 kilogram in flight mode during take-off, landing and taxi mode.

Heavier items such as laptops will still be required to be held in overhead departments with fear they could be a danger to other passengers during high turbulence if they become air-borne.

Airlines have to complete a safety checklist before the regulations can be approved, however, which will include detailing how they will ensure passengers do not use their devices in a disruptive way, according to the Herald Sun.

They must also show their aircraft manufacturers approve of the change.

Training for cabin crews will also have to be revised with necessity placed on ensuring passengers still pay attention to flight announcements.

Virgin Australia wasted no time after the announcement, releasing a statement on Friday from the chief customer officer Mark Hassell which claimed that the airline company had already re-lodged their submission and were waiting for approval

'In-flight entertainment is a key driver of customer satisfaction and this application marks the next phase of that product evolution,' Mr Hassell said.

Virgin Australia had re-lodged their submission by Friday according to their chief customer officer, with the airline planning to implement the regulation change as soon as possible

'Virgin Australia will work to immediately implement the use of hand-held personal electronic devices from gate to gate and will have further updates for customers in coming days.'

A spokesperson for Qantas told the Herald Sun that as of July 16, passengers on Qantas flights across New Zealand and the US were already enjoying the perks.

'Qantas passengers travelling on the majority of trans-Tasman routes can already use personal electronic devices during all phases of flight provided the devices are in flight mode,' said a Qantas spokeswoman.
