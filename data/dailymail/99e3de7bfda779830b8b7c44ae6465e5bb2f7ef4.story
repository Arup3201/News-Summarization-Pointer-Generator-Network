The average Briton has endured a niggling medical complaint for a year before seeing their doctor, a study has revealed.

One in five people leave it until there is something 'seriously wrong' and more than half never, or very rarely, visit their GP for a check-up.

Of the 2,000 adults polled, men wait an average of 12 months and 27 days before getting apparently minor ailments checked out, and women wait 11 months and 12 days.

The average Briton endures a medical complaint for a year before seeing their doctor - men wait an average of 12 months and 27 days, and women wait 11 months and 12 days

The research also showed the average Briton suffers with eight troublesome conditions a year - from stomach bugs and colds to headaches and back pain.

Worryingly, the study revealed people don't start taking their health seriously until they are in their thirties.

Only 14 per cent thought those aged 20 to 27 need to pay proper attention to their health and well-being.

The poll, which was commissioned by the Spire 
Bristol Hospital,  found that 30 per cent of us claim to have at least one problem, injury or undiagnosed source of pain at any one time.

And a quarter admitted suffering with regular headaches.

Four in ten said they suffer with back pain and two per cent said they experience fainting.

Rob Anderson, of Spire Healthcare, said: ‘Regular headaches and fainting can be warning signs of 
something serious, so anyone suffering should talk to a healthcare 
professional directly.

A quarter of people admit to suffering from regular headaches but few have seen their doctor about the problem

‘Things
like back pain are extremely common, but there are simple things your 
doctor can advise you about to ease and eliminate discomfort.

‘As the old saying goes, it's much better to be safe than sorry.’

He added that millions of 
Britons could be storing up serious medical conditions.

He said: ‘The amount of time people wait before getting health problems checked out is really quite shocking.

‘Putting
off a visit to your doctor is never the answer. ‘It means serious 
problems can get much worse and even becoming life-threatening and 
routine ailments go on for much longer, causing unnecessary discomfort.

‘In the long-run neglecting visits to your GP can put a big strain on the healthcare system.’

He continued: 'Lots of people feel embarrassed or as if they are bothering their doctor with routine problems, but a good GP should make you feel relaxed and comfortable so that you can discuss your concerns and get the answers you need.

‘Ignoring health concerns doesn't make them go away and having a niggling worry about something for months could lead to stress and tension.

‘In many instances there is a simple and quick remedy or procedure that can deal with the problem and dramatically improve a patient's quality of life - and there are now a variety of ways that people can reach out to a health professional, even if they can't visit their GP in person.’
