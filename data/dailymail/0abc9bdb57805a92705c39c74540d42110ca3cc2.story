She is the former anorexic turned plus-size model who has made headlines for years for her fluctuating weight.

But Crystal Renn, now a size 8, is these days catching the world's attention for a different reason: by confessing her hopes of designing a clothing line 'with body diversity in mind', and by smouldering as the face and body of a number of high-end fashion campaigns.

The stunning 26-year-old's latest job sees her striking a pose for Net-A-Porter's digital magazine in seductive summer shoot.

Smouldering: Crystal Renn's latest fashion shoot was for net-a-porter's digital magazine and she smouldered in a black ensemble

Donning stylish black ensembles from 
Alessandra Rich, Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane, Nina Ricci, Emilio 
Pucci, Gucci, Giuseppe Zanotti and Stella McCartney, Crystal stuns in 
the shots by photographer Laura Sciacovelli.

As one of the most talked about models in the world, Crystal opened up to the magazine about her modelling career and all-or-nothing approach to life.

The model - who recently expressed a belief that sample sizes should all be size 8 - explained that when she has a goal she chases it with gusto - and fashion was always on her radar.

The supermodel revealed that she put up pictures by fashion photographer Steven Meisel in her teenage bedroom while peers were hanging posters of Leonardo DiCaprio, and judging by her burgeoning fashion CV, it sure paid off.

Svelte: Crystal, who hit the headlines for her fluctuating weight, revealed that she wants to be known for her work not her frame

She may have made a name for herself as the girl who suffered from an eating disorder while trying to maintain her
size 0 figure when she first started out, then shot up to a size 16, but Crystal would like her work, rather than her frame, 
to be the reason for her fame.

She said: 'I need to know if I should elongate my neck, put my
shoulders down. It's all about the details.'

Happy days: Insisting that she is happy with the way she looks now, Crystal has previously revealed that she doesn't let her body dictate whether she's content or not

In her book Hungry, published in 2010, she candidly chronicled her tale of living and working with anorexia.

It was only when she allowed herself to feel secure at her 'natural weight' and became healthy again - in both body and mind - that her career took off.

Since losing weight, Crystal has 
found success as a straight-size model, and has starred in campaigns for 
companies including Jimmy Choo and, most recently, Agent Provocateur.

Insisting she is happy with the way she now looks, Crystal has previously revealed in interviews: 'I don't let my body dictate whether I'm happy or not. The goal is to go live, and worry about the rest later.'

And Crystal added that regardless of her dress size, the most important thing is to eat healthily and maintain a balanced diet.

Fluctuating weight: Crystal, who suffered from anorexia while trying to maintain her size 0 (UK size 4) figure when she started out as a model, was forced to address criticism that she was pressured into losing weight

She said: 'It's about the healthy eating habits that you have, and wherever your body falls. Whether that is actually a 4 or an 18, doesn't matter.'

She now has grand ambitions for the future and explained that if she no longer wants to be behind the lens she has a few other ideas up her stylish sleeve.

She said: 'Photography, creative directing, styling, acting... I would never commit 
to just one.

'A big goal for me is to design a fashion line 
with body diversity in mind.'

And judging by her life motto ('I've always believed that anything is possible. Maybe that’s my secret') and current career successes, she will make that happen.
