With his lightning strike in the USA’s opening World Cup match, Clint Dempsey finally moved out of the shadow of his celebrated colleague Landon Donovan. The goal, scored just 29 seconds after kick off helping to secure victory over long-time rival Ghana, was the fastest ever by a US player.

But it was a gesture during his celebrations just seconds after the ball hit the net that gives a glimpse into the two tragedies in the player’s life that have driven the newly dubbed Captain America to success.

As he ran around the pitch he looked up and then raised his fingers to the sky.

Sign of love: Team USA's World Cup soccer superstar Clint Dempsey pays tribute to both his sister and his former friend, both of whom died young and in heartbreaking circumstances by pointing his fingers skyward

It is his unique tribute to both his sister Jennifer and his former friend – both of whom died young and in heartbreaking circumstances.

Dempsey’s rise to the top of US soccer - the only US player to have scored in three consecutive World Cup campaigns - is a remarkable rags-to-riches story that would be considered far-fetched if it were a Hollywood script.

Now 31, he was brought up in the family's trailer in the backyard of his grandparents' home on the outskirts of Nacogdoches, a small town in East Texas.

The fourth of five children, he and his older brother Ryan became hooked on soccer after watching Hispanic boys from his neighborhood kicking around a basketball with their bare feet on a dirt field.

Rolled-up socks were used as goalposts.

Forgoing traditional American sports, he threw himself into the game.

It was not long before his family recognized his talent, and when he turned 10 they decided to see if others saw it too. His father, Aubrey, a carpenter, drove him for three hours to Dallas to trials for a local club team called the Longhorns.

The manager threw a ball to the young Dempsey, watched him trap it and then juggle it with his feet, and immediately he also was a believer.

Two or three times a week the family embarked on the six-hour round trip and his dad sold his boat and guns to pay for the gas money.

His mother, a nurse, worked every overtime shift she could and the family forewent their annual holiday.

Special occasions were spent in McDonald’s, the five siblings sharing one meal between them.

'My parents were crazy,' said Dempsey told the Guardian. 'They just wanted to do everything they could for their kids.'

But the family had another budding sports star in their midst and something had to give.

His elder sister Jennifer was so good at tennis she was about to turn professional and the family made the difficult decision to pull him out of the league and direct resources to her.

The decision left the 12-year-old “upset and angry' but he accepted it because he was very close to his sister.

But that heartache was nothing compared with what was to come.

Soon after the decision,  his sister, then 16, had fainted and been rushed to hospital.

She had actually suffered a brain aneurism and needed surgery.

He arrived at the hospital after everybody else and was told that his sister had not made it through. “They tell you and your heart falls from your chest,” he told the Guardian. 'You hit the ground and you cry for hours. You cry until your head aches.'

While the tragedy still hurts today, it allowed him to resume his football career and made him even more determined to succeed.

Dempsey explained that he had earlier spoken to his sister about death and she had said that if she died “I will help you get the ball in the net.'

'And that's why I look up to the sky now when I score - to remember her,' he said.

He played with even more intensity when he returned to Dallas and won a place at Furman University, a small private institution, in South Carolina, on a sports scholarship.

Farshid Niroumand, his coach at Nacogdoches High School, said he was 'consumed’ by the game.

'He was playing two or three years above his age and yet it still was not enough. He always wanted to challenge himself.

'He was so hungry for success. I think he still is. There was a fire inside him.'

At about this time, he became close friends with a Hispanic teenager named Victor Rivera Jr.

'They started out as rivals but became friends,' said Niroumand. 'They were good for each other. They pushed each other.'

While Dempsey made the cut for university, Rivera just missed out and trained to be policeman.

It was to lead to the second major tragedy in Dempsey’s life.

Just days before he was to take up his post, Rivera accidentally shot himself in the head – his gun going off as he picked up an ear plug from the floor.

Once again, Dempsey was devastated, but once again he channeled the emotion to better himself at football.

And in tribute to his old friend he also holds up a finger after scoring.

'People just see Clint’s passion, they don't see how compassionate and caring he is,' Niroumand said.

'They don't realize what he has gone through.'

At Furman University, Dempsey thrived so much that the New England Revolution, based near Boston, signed him before he even graduated.

From there he became one of the first American outfield players to move to the English Premier League, considered by many to be the best in the world.

He started at Fulham, a small London based club, and had to overcome prejudice from sceptical English players and fans, who did not consider the USA a serious footballing nation.

He thrived so much that bigger rivals Tottenham Hotspur poached him.

But the tight, aggressive English game, did not always suit his maverick and flamboyant style.

By now married and with three kids he decided to return to the USA and joined the Seattle Sounders, where he currently plays.

Doug Allison, the English-born coach at Furman University, said: 'He was confident but he was also always working on his game.

'He was training, training, training. He was always challenging himself. He was always taking risks. II took him to London in his first year and we got tickets to see Fulham play Liverpool.

'Five years later he was playing in the same game and I watched as he scored the winner that kept Fulham in the Premier League.

'It was an amazing moment.'

Along the way he became a permanent member of the US team, making his World Cup debut in 2006.

But in the eyes of the American public he always played second fiddle to Donovan until now.

Despite his towering ambition he has always kept his feet firmly on the ground and put his family first.

When he won the Honda Player of the Year in 2006, he donated the truck to his father.

And when his sister Crystal’s wedding took place just before a crucial match for the USA in 2011, he told the coach he was going “regardless” of the consequences.

In the end, he flew back, the night before the match day and took part in the game.

Now that Donovan has been left out of the squad, Dempsey, wearing the captain’s armband, has come to the fore.

'I don’t think he actually realizes what he has achieved,' said Allison. 'This is his time. He is one of the greatest players the US has ever had. It has been a truly amazing journey that he has undertaken.'
