One woman died and at least 20 other people were seriously injured in a stampede today when around 5,000 prospective students rushed to register at a university in South Africa.

Officials at the University of Johannesburg said two of the victims were fighting for their lives in hospital after being caught up in the crush at around 8am.

The institution's vice-chancellor, Ihron Rensburg, said the tragedy happened as hopeful students and their parents pushed to get through the university's main gates for the chance to secure late registration for the new academic year, which starts later this month.

Addressing a press conference, he said: 'When we opened the gates this morning, the rush to get in created an unbearable crush on those at the front.

'The outcome was that there was a lady who was the front who was crushed and she passed away.

'Two other people suffered very serious injuries and we fear for their lives.'

Prof Rensburg identified the dead woman as the mother of a male prospective student who came to the university today to apply for a place to study.

He said: 'The situation was particularly tragic as the young man was inside the registration tent and had no idea that this had happened.

'We are offering counselling and support to those who have been affected by this.'

The university's security manager Roelet Hugo said several thousand students and their parents formed a long queue outside the institution's city centre campus from the early hours of this morning.

He said several people were injured in the stampede after officials opened the gates to ease pressure on those stuck at the front.

He said: 'At around 7.30am, we noticed a crowd outside the main entrance.

'We deployed security officers outside the campus, but those at the back started pushing forward and pushing people in front of them. We at that stage had no choice but to open the gate.

'But at that stage, it was too late for three people who were trampled.'

Bunting Road campus in Johannesburg's central Auckland Park suburb.

Meanwhile,
officials confirmed they had suspended the registration of prospective 
students while they decided how best to proceed following the incident.

Johannesburg emergency services spokeswoman Nana Radebe said the number of people injured in the stampede had risen to 20.

She added that emergency personnel would remain at the scene all day to ensure the situation remained calm.

She
said: 'The situation is that there are currently three people in 
critical, but stable conditions and 17 who suffered minor injuries.

'It is a hot day and we are worried that people might collapse as they wait outside to enter.'

Meanwhile, paramedic spokesman Jeffrey
Wicks confirmed at least one woman was put on a ventilator at the scene
and said another eight suffered injuries.

He
said: 'The full scale of the situation remains unclear, but we can 
confirm that one woman remains in a critical condition after she 
suffered severe head and chest trauma.'

Officials said today's stampede was caused by a desperation to access limited places at South Africa's universities.

Like universities in Britain, most students apply for places months in advance.

However spaces on courses at some 
institutions are offered at the last minute, usually to students from 
poorer backgrounds who achieved well in their final school examinations.

The lack of widespread internet 
access and poor careers advice in rural or township areas means 
thousands of prospective applicants are forced to turn up in person to 
register their interest in further studies.

Experts believe the problem is 
symptomatic of a higher education system which has failed to expand 
adequately to South Africans' growing demand for university places 
following the end of apartheid.

Before the advent of democracy in 1994, university places were limited largely to the white population and a tiny black elite.

However, students from all backgrounds
are now able to apply for further studies, with many choosing to do so 
in a country where poverty and unemployment remain common.

Some critics argue that standards at 
South African universities have fallen in recent years and suggest 
entrance criteria should be raised.

The
University of Johannesburg describes itself as a 'comprehensive' 
institution which offers courses ranging from diplomas to degrees.

Last year, it received more than 85,000 applications for fewer than 12,000 places on its undergraduate courses.

It is situated across several campuses in Johannesburg, the country's largest city.
