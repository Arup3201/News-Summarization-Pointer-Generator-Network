Revellers across America grabbed their green and took to the streets and bars to celebrate another St. Patrick’s Day.

Spotted in the nation's capital, President Barack Obama kick started his own observance of the holiday at a boisterous Irish pub with his
ancestral cousin from Moneygall, Ireland, at his side.

He wore no Kelly green as he sipped a pint of Guinness among the crowd but his jacket was pierced with a button that 
read, 'VIP GUEST — Tell 'em Danny sent you.'

Cheers: Wearing a moss green jacket and a button reading 'VIP GUEST - Tell 'em Danny sent you,' the president hoisted a pint above the crowd

Henry Healy, an eighth cousin to Obama and the closest relative to the president still living in Moneygall sipped along side him in addition to the Moneygall pub's owner, Ollie Hayes.

The Dubliner pub's owner, in Washington, Danny Coleman predicted that, at least on this day, Obama could count on the support 
of the millions of Americans who claim Irish ancestry.

After toasting with the pub's patrons - and finishing his pint, as the owner reported - the president stepped out to the streets, wading into a crowd featuring leprechaun hats and others in dyed green hair.

Just north, Vice President Joe Biden
attended Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's parade as part of Mr Obama's 
re-election campaign, greeting over 100,000 spectators who were expected
to turn out.

Bottoms up: The owner confirmed that the president finished his pint among the rest of the bar patrons

Support: The Dubliner's owner predicted that the president could, at least on St Patrick's Day, count on the support of the millions of Americans who claim Irish ancestry

Irish stash: In conversation with Ollie Hayes the president wiped some of the beer's thick foam that stuck to his upper lip in a thin mustache

In New York City, hundreds of 
thousands of people thronged the streets for a view of their own parade,
which has been held for the past 250 years.

They also took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather which averaged out at 60F/16C.

The 251st annual parade began at 11 
o’clock, making its way uptown along Fifth Avenue and past St. Patrick’s
Cathedral at 50th St, finally ending at 86th Street on the Upper East 
Side.

The iconic Empire State Building is also honouring the holiday while glowing green all week.

Vice President: Joe Biden, seen at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's parade, will join the president Tuesday to meet the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and attend a St. Patrick's Day lunch at the Capitol

People to see: Mr Biden greeted parade goers who were expected to turn out as more than 100,000 in number this morning

The Green House: In a recently new tradition for the White House, the South Lawn's fountains were dyed green, similar to Chicago's tradition which is the Obama family's hometown

Welcoming reception: Following the Irish Prime Minister's meeting Tuesday, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will host an evening reception at the White House

NBC’s Francis X. Comerford served as this year’s Grand Marshal. 

In Boston, parade-goers were encouraged by Mayor Thomas M. Merino to keep things safe and ‘family friendly.’

The mayor said: ‘It’s going to be a 
beautiful spring weekend, and we are working hard to provide a festive, 
fun, and family-friendly atmosphere for all to enjoy.’

New York: North of the president and vice president today, New York City celebrated their annual St Patrick's Day parade through Manhattan which is the biggest in the world

Parade route: Seen marching up along Central Park's East Side, the 251st annual parade followed along Fifth Avenue, past St. Patrick's Cathedral at East 50th St, before ending at East 86th Street

March: Green flags danced along the street that ran parallel to the city's famed Central Park seen on the right

Patiently waiting: Across the street from St Patrick's Cathedral, spectators waited eagerly for the parade as well as a glimpse of their new cardinal, Timothy Dolan

As such, bars and liquor stores will close early, and additional officers will patrol the streets.

Boston’s
parade will begin at 1pm – liquor stores will shut there doors at 4pm, 
and bars have been ordered to close no later than 7:30pm this evening.

Far down south in Savannah, revelers set out folding chairs before dawn, and by the 
time the parade kicked off about 10 am in Georgia’s oldest city, they 
were piled three-deep on the sidewalks. Lines of thirsty patrons were 
spilling out of downtown bars before the pre-parade Mass wrapped up at 
the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.

Appearance: Timothy Cardinal Dolan, Archbishop of New York made that appearance stepping out of the cathedral waving to the crowds

History: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg greeted the archbishop on the day's parade which first took place on March 17 of 1762

Inviting: With the New York weather blanketing the crowds in a cool 60 degree morning, every assortment of spectator appeared to come out

'It’s ridiculous for still
being in the am,' said Timmy Watkins, a utility worker from 
neighboring Rincon, who emerged from Pinkie Master’s Lounge with a beer 
in each hand after standing in line for 30 minutes. 'These are both 
mine. I waited in line long enough. I figured I’d get two.'

Started
in 1856 by settlers who immigrated to the Georgia coast, the St. 
Patrick’s Day celebration has grown from a local procession with 
religious roots to a sprawling street party that’s Savannah’s biggest 
tourist draw of the year.

Local officials expected this year’s party to 
be one of the biggest yet, with the holiday falling on Saturday and 
postcard perfect weather — a sunny 76 degrees in the morning that was 
forecast to rise into the 80s.

Neighbours: Next door to New York, law enforcement in Morristown, New Jersey, took to the streets in green beards and top hats

Lining up: Down south in Georgia, spectators eagerly waited a glimpse of Atlanta's 130th St. Patrick's Day Parade

St Patrick himself: A newly inflated St. Patrick helium balloon wafted in Atlanta's streets, waiting its parade debut

Cultural treat: An Irish dancer performed from toe to toe on one of the many parade floats in Atlanta

Northwest in Illinois, Chicago kept to 
its own annual tradition that brought out thousands of spectators to 
catch a glimpse of its river turned green.

Cheers erupted Saturday morning in the 
Windy City as a motor boat sped around in a circle and a man on board 
dumped the secret dye mixture that in minutes transforms the river into a
psychedelic, vivid green.

Thousands gathered Saturday morning along the Chicago River, some in 
shamrock-shaped sunglasses and others dressed as leprechauns with 
strap-on orange beards.

Seeing green: In Illinois, the Chicago River was dyed green with the help of several speed boats for their annual festivities

Eye catching: The river's dye drew thousands along its bank this morning, with a few kayakers paddling in the water, to get a glimpse of the bright green water

Process: The Marina Towers loom in the background of a green Chicago river while boats ride back and forth on the river between Wabash and Columbus Avenues dropping the dye into the river

Holding hands: Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny (left) walked Chicago's parade today with Mayor Rahm Emanuel

This year, the guest of honor was Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who 
appeared at City Hall with Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Both men sported green 
ties and shamrocks in their lapels.

Mr
Kenny says he's honoured to take part in Chicago's parade. He praised 
the city with a large Irish population for being so open and receptive 
to immigrants.

'It’s a real privilege for me, as leader of my country, to come to 
Chicago on this St. Patrick’s Day 2012 and participate in the parade,' 
Kenny said. 'And that’s a privilege that I shall remember for a long 
time.'

More than 
100 St. Patrick’s Day parades will be held across the U.S. today, though
New York and Boston boast the biggest and most elaborate celebrations.

The
often-besotted Hoboken parade in New Jersey was cancelled after city 
officials decided to move the event to a weekday in hopes of toning down
the debauched behaviour.

The celebration was notorious for partiers looking for an alternative to New York’s calm, family-friendly festivities.
