A bargain hunter who picked up an ultra-rare piece of pottery for just £2 at a car boot sale was stunned to see it go under the hammer for almost £5,000.

David Lambert paid for the unusual blue Royal Doulton figurine they spotted at a car boot sale in Stockport with a £2 coin. 

But Mr Lambert and his wife Helen, who are both fans of the brand, were puzzled after they were unable to find any information on it in their Royal Doulton books.

The Lamberts paid just £2 for a rare Royal Doulton 'Spook' ornament was produced in 1922

This figurine is thought to have a one-off prototype glaze, which helped boost its value further

They took it to valuers from BBC's Flog It programme, and were thrilled to discover they had bought a 1922 'Spook' figure believed to be worth around £300.

The excited couple, from Colne, Lancashire put the figurine up to auction and were shocked when bids reached almost £5,000.

Auctioneer, John Cook, who sold the ornament at Gerrard’s Auctions, Lytham St Anne's was surprised to see its blue colour and believes it is a prototype glaze.

He thinks the figure could be the only one in this colour and this is why the hammer fell much higher than expected.

The lucky couple from Colne, Lancashire, head to car boot sales in search of a bargain most weekends but have decided to save the cash they raised from selling the ornament.

Helen said: 'When David first came home with the piece I really didn’t like it.

'The auction was just unbelievable and I was shocked at the starting price let alone what it actually sold for.

'After the sale I rang David to tell him what had happened. He couldn’t believe it and I was shaking when I was telling him so I had to get the lady from the auction room to confirm the news for him.

'I think this sort of thing is a only once in a lifetime thing to happen to people and we don’t expect it to happen again.'

The Lamberts are loyal Royal Doulton collectors - but could find no trace of the Spook in their catalogues
