It will feel like -13C (9F) today as 60mph Arctic winds and snow sweep over the country creating ‘blizzard-like’ conditions.

Forecasters said more than three inches of snow could be dumped on the Midlands and the North this afternoon and tomorrow, with high ground in Scotland expecting nearly six inches.

Meanwhile temperatures will tumble from 10C (50F) in the North this morning to -2C (28F) tonight, and in Scotland they could drop to -4C (25F).

The Met Office issued weather warnings for today and tomorrow, warning of travel disruption as snow falls and the wind picks up.

Frank Saunders, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘An active cold front is expected to push southeast across the UK during today, introducing an increasingly cold and unstable air mass.

‘Showers will become frequent and heavy, falling primarily as snow and driven well inland by strong to gale force northwesterly winds.

‘Commuters and other travellers seem likely to face a variety of winter hazards, especially later on today and early tomorrow, although it’s likely that snowfall in some areas may be more patchy, particularly towards the East.’

Dan Williams, spokesman for the Met Office, said: ‘Where snow does fall, we could see blizzard-like conditions because of high winds. It could make for some difficult driving conditions.’

He added that the cold spell is due to last until the end of next week, although there is no more snow forecast after tomorrow.

'Alert and readiness': The Met Office has issued a cold weather alert from today to Sunday, warning of increased risk to vulnerable patients

Meanwhile Public Health England issued a weather alert, putting hospitals and GP surgeries in northern England on standby for a surge of patients. Their ‘level two’ alert, which covers Yorkshire, the North East, the North West, the Midlands and East of England, also warns social services to keep a close eye on the elderly and vulnerable.

Dr Angie Bone, head of the extreme events team at Public Health England, said: ‘Although many parts of the country have already seen colder weather this winter, it does look like we’re in for a further spell with bitter winds and snow showers likely to make it feel particularly cold.

‘In this sort of weather we know that older people and people in poor health tend to stay indoors. While this is sensible, it’s worth remembering these people may need help getting to a hospital or GP appointment, with shopping or prescription fetching, or just someone to talk to.

‘If you know someone in this situation, and most of us do, think about what you can you do to help out.

‘Contrary to popular belief, it’s actually working age adults who have most slips and trips outside in cold and icy weather, not older people, which is why it’s important to wear shoes with a good, slip-resistant grip to prevent any accidental falls.’

The bitter cold is being caused by the jet stream moving south of the UK, dragging cold northerly winds down from the Arctic. The snow and winds causing chaos in the US are part of a different weather system.
