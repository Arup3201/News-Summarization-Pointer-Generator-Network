James Wade began his challenge for the 2015 World Darts Championship with a 3-1 victory against Jamie Lewis on Sunday evening.

Sixth-seed Wade, who has twice been a semi-finalist at the Alexandra Palace tournament, raced out to an early one set lead against his Welsh rival.

Lewis, however, fought back to claim the next set but Wade showed his class to close out the next two sets for the win.

Wade is set to meet Stephen Bunting in the next round if he beats the winner of the qualifying match between Jermaine Wattimena and Robert Marijanovic on Monday.

Earlier in the evening, Dave Chisnall defeated Dutch debutant Ryan De Vreede 3-0 while Kim Huybrechts cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mickey Mansell.

John Michael beat Jani Haavisto by four legs to one in the evening’s opener in the preliminary game. 

But Michael’s winning feeling would be short-lived as Ian White dispatched the Greek 3-1 in the final encounter of the evening.
