A knife-wielding couple who raided a shop have been jailed after one of their own mothers shopped them to police.

James Clewes and his partner, Bernadette Chapman, stormed a Best One convenience store carrying a blade each.

Clewes held the terrified cashier at knifepoint and demanded cash while Chapman stuffed the money into a bag along with stolen cigarettes.

Behind bars: James Clewes, 32, and Bernadette Chapman, 27, have been jailed after holding up a convenience store at knifepoint

They fled the scene but, within a couple of hours, 27-year-old Chapman confessed what she had done to her mother, who immediately called police.

The pair were arrested later that day at a nearby pub and have now been jailed following a hearing at Bolton Crown Court.

Clewes, 32, of Bond Street, Bury, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars after admitting robbery, possessing a bladed article and two counts of threatening a member of public with a bladed article.

Bernadette Chapman, also of Bond Street, was jailed for two years and six months after admitting robbery and possessing a bladed article.

Detective Constable Mick Yates said: 'Clewes and Chapman armed themselves with knives and used the threat of violence to terrify staff at the shop.

'By their own admissions it was a desperate act.

'It seems the reality of what they had just done quickly dawned on them and Chapman in particular was quick to confess.

'Faced with this revelation and an extremely difficult decision to make, credit must go to Bernadette Chapman's mother, who without hesitation called the police.'

Clewes and Chapman raided the shop, in Bury, just after 7am on Thursday, May 23.

As they tried to escape through the front door following the robbery, a member of the public tried to hold the door shut from the outside.

After failing to get out through the back, the couple returned to the front and smashed a glass panel before running off.

They were later linked to the crime through clothes recovered during a search of their house.

Det Con Mick Yates said: 'I must reserve special praise for the witness who saw this robbery in action and bravely did everything he could to stop them escaping from the shop.'

He added that this member of the public and Chapman's mother showed that 'there are members of our community who will not sit by and watch something criminal happen and who will not sit back in the knowledge that someone is responsible for such offences and do nothing'.

He added: 'They have proven that the police and the public can work together side by side to bring criminals to justice.'
