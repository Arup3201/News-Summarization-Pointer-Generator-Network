They might have been forgotten forever.

But against all odds, 31 undeveloped rolls of film shot by one single soldier during the Second World War have finally been brought to light.

Along with them: two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital, another musing about the meaning of it all.  

The rare materials were discovered at an auction in Ohio late last year by freelance photographer and old film fanatic Levi Bettweiser.

Now, after months of work in his makeshift dark room (kitchen), he has developed the entire catalog of 70-year-old pictures.

And the results are breath-taking.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Discovered: 31 undeveloped rolls of film shot by one single soldier during the Second World War have finally been brought to light

Breathtaking: The images capture soldiers leaving church, waiting for trains, milling around a dock, or panning shots of snowy hills

Captured a moment: More quiet moments capture the soldiers' down time, with officers chatting on a dirt track next to a Coca Cola van

Bettweiser told PetaPixel: 'What I'm noticing is that most of the images are wide landscape scene shots. The photographer seemed to be really interested in capturing moments that had kind of a large significance to multiple people.' 

Nothing is known about the photographer except that he was American and had been posted to France before being sent home due to injury - facts gleaned from his letter written on American Red Cross paper. 

Each roll was labeled with a location - Boston Harbor, Lucky Strike Beach, LaHavre Harbor.

The images capture soldiers leaving church, waiting for trains, milling around a dock.

One shot shows women cheering from the railings of a harbor as soldiers on a ship pull in, with the sign 'Welcome home!'

Another features militia trampling through thick snow at what appears to be a prison.

More quiet moments capture the soldiers' down time, with officers chatting on a dirt track next to a Coca Cola van.

Also discovered: Two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital (right), another musing about the meaning of everything (left). The two pages were rolled around two rolls of film bundled in a water-soaked bag

Around the world: Each roll was labeled with a location across the globe - Boston Harbor, Lucky Strike Beach, LaHavre Harbor

Just another face in the crowd: Nothing is known about the photographer except that he was American and had been posted to France

The anonymous soldier was also sent home due to injury - a fact gleaned from his letter written on American Red Cross paper

Belief: Soldiers can be seen listening to a speech aboard a boat and a chef stands out in the crowd in his white uniform looking away

Global significance: Many of the shots are panning landscapes showing all soldiers together, resonating with the global experience

Amid global turmoil, the anonymous photographer paused to snapshot his colleagues making their way up a deserted road, with mountains behind them and a sole Christmas tree in the snow.

The letters are equally moving. 

The first, typed on a typewriter, muses about self-confidence, religion, and belief.

It read: 'Your greatest problem is yourself. You are also your greatest treasure.

'If you can get yourself determined upon --- find out what you are and what you are for ----- and if you can discover and develope (sic) the elements of value in your nature, your life will take on the beauty of orderliness and your need of the savings bank will be less and less, for you will be your own riches.

Marching on: It seemed the photographer always had his lens to hand to capture every little segment of their journey into Europe

France: Signs suggest he was in France when he took this picture near their 'latrine' (French for the toilets commonly used in barracks)

Another world: The breathtaking images which have lain undiscovered for 70 years show the eye-opening of a young American man

Typical European square: He had an eye for landscape shots, capturing stately French buildings that dwarf people into insignificance

On the road again: Grainy, black and white, and dark, the solitary shots of blackened roads with lone cars offer a bleak insight 

Difficult to develop: With many of the rolls water-damaged, it was hard for photographer Levi Bettweiser to develop all of them perfectly

Standing guard: While soldiers mill around a cabin, the photographer puts it into the context of France's delicate countryside

'I say if you can, for this procedure takes wisdom, and wisdom is a fruit which ripens slowly. 

'Perhaps you are not yet wise; perhaps you are still incapable of self-analysis; perhaps youare (sic) confused amid the surfaces and appearances of life; perhaps your code of conduct is of the alleged sages; perhaps you are disheartened and discouraged ---- even in frenzy of retreat before (sic) the things in you (sic) life which seem to oppose you and beat you back.

'But even so, this is but a condition or mood which is not final.

'The condition will right itself, the mood will pass! "I've missed the true meaning, the beauty and real purpose of life ---- and it's a little too latenow to recapture my youth, or to go back. I'm bewildered, confused to the point that I no longer know what to do with the debris of my life, what to salvage or to discard"

'When logic and reason and all else fails, there is only one thing left ---- to revert oto (sic) blind faith.

'It is just such faith upon which all religion is based ---- the unshakable belief that if one follows the course honest, generous and sincere living, all else will work out O.K.

Funeral: Crowds gathered in suits and uniform at a European-looking building for what appears to be a funeral

'Belief and trust in God, therefore, and a determined effort to live according to his will and The Golden Rule seems to be the only real solution for the turmoil of this world.

'You're an atheist anddon't (sic)...'. 

The following page has never been found. 

Later, he wrote a letter home from hospital. The beginning of this letter is also missing. It starts:

'...in a way to be back - but my return will also be poignant with regret.

'I've always had a lonesome life, dreaming of success and love and happiness I've never gained, but here in France I have had a few brief tastes of what life could have to offer to the lucky ones.

'I am thinking now of Hugett, and more recently, of lovely little Hugett Becker, and all the others I have seen over here.

Stepping back: Each image offers the bigger picture. A boy cycling past the crowd gives a sense of the wider European context

Looking on: Standing behind his fellow soldiers, the crowd looks out at a 'Welcome home' ship in the foreground, a battleship behind

Waiting: Sitting in the sun, dozens of men rest at a train station waiting to be picked up to move to their next destination

Idyllic: In the midst of turmoil and devastation, shots like this of a solitary path and luscious trees are a glimmer of joy

Incredible: These are the rolls of film that were put up for auction in Ohio at the end of last year and snapped up by an enthusiast

'Hugett is the loveliest sweetest little thing which ever happened to me, but it is so unfortunate for me that thousands of miles will separate us before the end of the year'.

Many of the rolls of film were water-damaged, making it questionable whether Bettweiser could develop them. 

He spent days and nights on end processing them with a cocktail of chemicals before attempting to open each one. 

It is part of his larger project, The Rescued Film Project, aiming to bring to light lost or forgotten photographs.  

The experience, Bettweiser explained, has been incredible. 

'When I pull the film out of my film developing tank, I'm the very first person who has ever seen that picture,' he said.

'They've never been enjoyed, they've never been remembered. And so it almost increases the weight of the importance of that photo because it's never had those moments.

'Even if the photographer's not around any more to remember them, we want to reveal the images to the world because the moments in time that were captured on these rolls of film were important to someone at some point.'

Painstaking: Levi Bettweiser, of the Rescued Film Project, spent months labeling each roll and working out how best to treat them

Analysis: Bettweiser said he took extra care to determine which rolls had been water-damaged before attempting to develop them

Experience: He said the feeling was incredible to be the first person ever to see all the pictures developed 70 years later
