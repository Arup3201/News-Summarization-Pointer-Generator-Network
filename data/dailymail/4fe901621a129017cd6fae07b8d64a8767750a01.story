Perhaps there is something to the predictions tucked inside fortune cookies after all.

After opening a cookie that promised he would 'soon come into a lot of gold', William Johnson promptly went out and bought a lottery scratch card - just in case.

Mr Johnson was stunned to discover he had scooped a $1million prize after he scratched the card in Southwick, Massachusetts.

A millionaire overnight: William Johnson bought a scratch card after a fortune cookie told him he would come into a 'lot of gold' - and promptly won $1million

Mr Johnson says he cracked open the fortune cookie after enjoying a meal with his wife, and was compelled to pick up the Massachusetts Millionaire Mania scratch card the following day.

He selected the cash option on the prize, meaning he received a one-time lump sum payment of $650,000, according to wcvb.com.

The Lottery said he and his wife are planning to buy a lake house with their winnings.

Colonial News on Southwick Street in Feeding Hills, where Mr Johnson bought the winning ticket, will receive $10,000 commission on the sale.
