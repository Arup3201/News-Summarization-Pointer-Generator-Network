These days it seems like there’s a Tesco on every corner. However, in one road, a determined woman is battling against the odds to stop the shopping giant’s relentless march.

Enid Jones is the last remaining resident on a street that Tesco wants to bulldoze to make way for a new superstore.

While the 58-year-old has seen all 11 of her neighbours agree to sell up and move out so that their homes can be demolished, she is making a lone stand and refusing.

Enid Jones, 58, has seen 11 of her neighbours agree to move out for their street, which is to be flattened for Tesco. She said: 'It's a matter of principle. I just don't want to leave my house'

Tesco and Marks & Spencer have signed a deal with developers and the local council to build a new shopping park in the seaside resort of Aberystwyth, West Wales. Mrs Jones will be the only resident left in Glyndwr Road, above

She said: ‘I’ve got it just the way I like it and I don’t want to leave my home.’

Mrs Jones lived in the same road as a 
child before moving away. But she bought another three-bed house in the 
terrace street nine years ago – and thought she would stay there for the
 rest of her life.

Developers have offered to buy or 
build another home for her if she will agree to make way for the new 
shopping park in the seaside town of Aberystwyth, West Wales. But she 
said: ‘I’ve settled down here and have made it my home.

‘I’m holding on to this  house because
 I love my home. It’s a matter of principle. I just don’t want to leave 
my house.’

Under the plans, the road will be flattened and redeveloped 
into a shopping park containing Tesco and Marks and Spencer, creating 
hundreds of jobs.

Tesco is planning a 25,000 sq ft supermarket on the site which also includes the neighbouring car park - while M&S wants to build a three-storey, 36,000 sq ft store. Above is an illustration of how it would look

This is when central government, a local authority or a private company has the legal right to buy or take rights over your property if it falls within a public or private development project.

Such projects range from large-scale airport expansions through to smaller scale expansions of sewer, water or gas pipelines.

In all cases, owners and occupiers directly affected by a project are served 'notice', and will be offered 'compensation' to reflect the losses and disturbance caused by a compulsory purchase or a 'statutory' scheme.

The shops have signed a deal with 
developers and the council and Mrs Jones fears they could use a 
compulsory purchase order to force her out of her home – but she has 
hired a solicitor to help her ‘fight  them all the way’.

She added:  ‘I 
am diabetic and my eyesight is deteriorating. The house is so 
convenient.’

She said talks between her, the developers and the council were now in ‘limbo’.

Tesco is planning a 25,000 sq ft 
supermarket on the site, which also includes the neighbouring car park, 
while M&S wants to build a three-storey, 36,000 sq ft store.

A Tesco
 spokesman said the firm was delighted to be investing in the town and 
planned to create 200 jobs.

A spokesman for Ceredigion County 
Council said: ‘Mrs Jones has been advised throughout the discussions 
that the developer may possibly request the council to consider the use 
of a compulsory purchase order.

‘The council has made it known that the preferred developer remains open to discussion should Mrs Jones’s position alter.’
