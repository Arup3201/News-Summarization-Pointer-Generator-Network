A community has been rocked by the tragic deaths of a high school student and three of her friends after their car slammed into a tree in northern NSW.

Samantha Enright, 17, and her friends Jessica Camidge, 22, Richard Wells, 19, and William Manton, 20, died on Wednesday morning after the car driven by Ms Camidge slammed a into tree at Newrybar, north of Ballina.

The occupants were travelling in a Hyundai Excel which was attempting to overtake a B-double on a stretch of the, before Ms Camidge swerved to miss another truck about 2am Wednesday.

The accident which occurred on the Pacific Highway north of Ballina almost split the vehicle in two

Police are now investigating whether speed and alcohol may have been a factor in the crash that killed four young friends - who were believed to have been travelling to buy a cigarette lighter.

Ms Camidge was driving the 40km-stretch needed to make the journey when the noise of the accident woke nearby residents.

Police Inspector Nicole Bruce said the force of the impact, which almost split the vehicle in two, would have been so severe that the four would have died instantly.

She said the driver attempted to pass a B-double truck over double lines while driving from Byron Bay to Ballina and then swerved to miss another oncoming truck.

'They missed the truck but lost control and heavily impacted with a tree almost splitting the car in half,' she told AAP.  'It was fairly horrific.

NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the accident was a 'tragedy beyond description.' 

'This is a tragedy that is beyond description,' he told Macquarie Radio on Wednesday.

'There is no way you can describe this - four young Australians are dead.'

Police commissioner Andrew Scipione told young drivers to be careful following the incident he found difficult to comprehend

The incident occurred along a stretch of highway which was undergoing upgrades in northern NSW

A Newrybar resident, near to where the accident occurred, said he was woken at 2am to a 'loud bang' and the sound of helicopters circling above.

'We were woken by a loud bang around 2am, then surrounded by helicopters for the next few hours,' Peter Siefken told AAP.

Mr Scipione encouraged parents to talk to their children about driving safely in the wake of Wednesday's multiple fatality.

'Get those that you know that aren't that experienced, sit them down and talk to them, have a look at those images (of the crash).'

'Let them know that lives will be changed forever as a result of a stupid act that happened late last night.'

'We all have to learn from these sorts of tragedies or the people that have died have died for no reason.'

The fatal smash occurred along an 80km/h section of road, which is undergoing a long-awaited upgrade.

The Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade, which will replace the deadly single-lane stretch of highway with dual carriageway, is expected to open in six months, Ballina Shire mayor David Wright said.

'This is a tragic loss of life and shows how imperative this highway upgrade is,' Mr Wright told AAP.

However, Mr Siefken said the roadworks had created a hazard for motorists.

Wednesday's crash is hauntingly similar to a crash in nearby Broken Head in 2006 that claimed the lives of four teenage friends and shocked the community.

Four years later, three friends in their 20s were killed on the Pacific Highway at Ewingsdale when their car collided with a B-double truck.

More recently, a 41-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman were killed in a crash at Woodburn, south of Ballina, on the Pacific Highway.

A resident claimed that the stretch of road, which is currently undergoing upgrades, is an unsafe road to drive on
