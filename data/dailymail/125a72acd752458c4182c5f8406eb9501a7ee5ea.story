Teresa Giudice and husband Joe are worried about their four daughters.

On Wednesday TMZ reported the Real Housewives Of New Jersey stars will ask a judge to stagger their prison sentences so that one parent can take care of their children while the other serves their time behind bars.

On Tuesday the couple pleaded guilty to several charges including bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and 
wire fraud, and failing to pay taxes.

Their children are all young - Gia, is aged 13, Gabriella, is aged 11, Milania, is aged nine, and Audriana, is aged five.

One of the couple's attorneys, Miles Feinstein, told TMZ he's 'confident' the judge will grant the reality stars' request. Their sentencing date is scheduled for July 8.

Under federal guidelines, 
Joe faces a potential sentence of 37 to 46 months and Teresa 
could get 21 to 27 months.

Also on Wednesday, RadarOnline reported Teresa will ask if she can serve her time under house arrest.

'Before Teresa is formally sentenced by the judge, she will meet with the United States Probation Department and a report will be prepared,' a source told the site.

'The report will outline recommendations for sentencing for the judge to consider and one of those items will include if house arrest is suitable for Teresa.'

If she does get to serve her time in the family's sprawling mansion, prosecutors will fight to band her Bravo reality show cameras from filming there, according to the site.

UsWeekly pointed out in their March 17 cover story that there's more trouble on the horizon for Joe who could get 10 years in jail for allegedly using his brother Pietro's ID in 2010 to secure a driver's license.

The couple arrived hand-in-hand on Tuesday and did not talk to reporters assembled outside.

They were asked by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas if they admitted their guilt, to which both replied: 'Yes, your honor,' according to NJ.com.

Their lawyer, Henry Klingeman, read a statement on Teresa's behalf after they left the courtroom.

'Today, I took responsibility for a series of mistakes I made several years ago,' she said. 'I am heartbroken that this is affecting my family â€” especially my four young daughters, who mean more to me than anything in the world.'

The plea deal comes after they pleaded not guilty last year to dozens of charges including bank fraud, wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud.

They were accused of exaggerating income while applying for loans before their Bravo reality show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after the first season aired.

They are also accused of submitting fraudulent mortgage and loan applications and fabricating tax returns and W-2 forms.

Joe allegedly failed to file federal tax returns for several years beginning in 2004.

Earlier this week it was reported the couple had struck a plea deal with the US Attorney's Office over the 41 counts of fraud.

Federal prosecutors previously said the couple faced up to 50 years in prison.

Joe
 likely will be given permission to remain in the country. Since he is 
an Italian and not a US citizen, he could have been deported after 
conviction, according to prosecutors.

The
 Giudices were charged with 39 counts of fraud last July plus two more 
counts in November. The charges allege that between 2001 and 2011 they 
engaged in conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud.

They
 were both charged with bank fraud, loan application fraud and 
bankruptcy fraud. Joe also is charged with failing to file tax returns 
for 2005-2009. They pleaded not guilty and the judge denied their 
request for separate trials.

Teresa
 has talked about her efforts to stay strong amid the legal trouble for 
the sake of her daughters.
