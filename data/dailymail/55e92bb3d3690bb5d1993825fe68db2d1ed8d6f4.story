Nokia has unveiled the handsets it hopes will help it take on Apple and Google in the smartphone war.

The firm launched two new handset running Microsoft's software, and also unveiled a recharging 'pillow' that does away with the need to plug in a cable.

However, the ailing firm saw its share price plummet before the announcement had even finished.

Nokia's Lumia 920, which was launched today, is the phone the firm is banking on to help it take on Apple and Google.

'This is the most innovative smartphone 
in the world,' said Jo Harlow, Senior Vice President of Smart Devices, 
as she held up the Lumia 920.

'This is Lumia, and it’s time to switch,' she told an audience in New York in a clear encouragement for users to desert their iPhone or Android handsets.

However, investors seemed to disagree.

Nokia's share price dropped by over 10 percent during the firm's announcement as investors remained unconvinced by the firm's mobile strategy.

An hour after the event began the share price was down 11.48 percent to $2.51 per share, suggesting the tie-up with Microsoft was poorly received.

The firm also revealed a midrange handset, the Lumia 820.

Styled to match the current Lumia 900 flagship, the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 both have a glossy polycarbonate frame that’s light and described as 'comfortingly warm to the touch'.

On the 820 the case is swappable for other colours.

The screens (measuring 4.3ins on the 820 and a palm-stretching 4.5ins on the 920) are both pin-sharp and high-resolution.

They even had a new app to offer effects like shop and restaurant names floating in the street as you look at the screen.

Nokia also boasts they can be used with gloves on.

Capacitive touchscreen displays respond to the electric conductivity in the human hand, so gloves have always been a no-no.

The Lumia 920, however, has Super Sensitive Touch which is designed so you can use it with ski gloves on your hands.

Nokia's Lumia 920 uses a pillow to charge, meaning no cables have to be plugged in

The Lumia 920 comes with wireless charging so you don’t need cables – just plonk it on a wireless charging mat like the Fatboy Charging pillow.

Nokia is using a popular standard of wireless charging so that multiple devices will work with these chargers.

When software updates, music and video can all be downloaded to the phone over the air, one day you may never need to plug it in.

The Lumia 920 includes PureView technology – Nokia’s name for its camera system.

The phone doesn’t match the 808 Pureview launched in the summer with its 41MP sensor and chunky profile, but at least this 8.7MP model is slim as a result.

Jo Harlow stressed that the Lumia 920 uses 'revolutionary camera technology' that it’s claimed will collect between five and ten times the light of many cameraphones.

'It’s better than most digital SLRs,' she insisted.

New camera software also made it easier to add extra effects as you shoot – very like Instagram.

There’s a very neat feature called Smart Shoot which is ideal when someone walks in front as you’re taking a shot.

The camera takes multiple snaps and allows you to remove moving objects like a careless passer-by.

Other effects allow you to add video elements to still shots and image stabilisation helps guard against blur.

The Lumia 920 also has NFC – Near Field Communication – the contactless data system used in door entry systems and the London Underground’s Oyster cards.

Though this technology has still to be widely used in mobiles, the plan is it will turn the phone into a wallet.

It can also be used with suitable speakers and headphones to transfer music playback with one tap.

The handsets revealed this afternoon are
slim, slick-looking devices with features to bring about the end of the
charging cable.

They look great: eye-poppingly bright
with high contrast and deep blacks and vivid colours.

The screen also 
promises blur-free scrolling of text and improved visibility in bright 
sunlight – something that defeats many smartphones.

The big question remains – will all this
be enough to drag people away from Android and iPhone?

The hardware is 
certainly deeply attractive, the processor seems nimble and responsive, 
the new screen is immersive and the camera has many neat features.

But 
Nokia may find the lure of the iPhone is hard to beat, especially with 
the iPhone 5 announced next Wednesday.

But just as important as the hardware is the software that powers the phones.

Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system was launched two years ago as an alternative to the all-conquering iPhone and Android systems.

But it has failed to dent their massive market share, capturing under 3 per cent of smartphone sales, according to research firm Gartner.

So today’s launch also showed off the new version of the software, called Windows Phone 8.

Microsoft’s mobile phone plans are dependent on the success of today’s launch, too.

Windows Phone 8 is strikingly different from Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android systems.

On the iPhone, to move from one app to another you need to quite one, return to the home screen and launch the other.

It’s a bit like walking from your bedroom to the bathroom but having to go via the front door.

With Windows Phone, the screen is populated with a ribbon of squares called Live Tiles which constantly refresh.

So the People Hub shows your Facebook and Twitter contacts, say, while one with your personal details updates every time a relevant addition arrives, like a text message, status update and so on.

Today’s announcement revealed more about the new version of Windows Phone, and Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer claimed today as an important 
milestone, with a user interface that’s 'truly unique' in what he claims
will be 'the year for Windows'.

The tiles are now resizable and capable of displaying more information such as how many messages are waiting from particular people in tiles dedicated to them.

All 100,000 Windows Phone apps will work on the new phones, but some yet-to-be-released apps may utilise new features incompatible with earlier models.

There are still dedicated Nokia Windows apps like a neat Nokia Drive program that turns the phone into a satnav with turn-by-turn directions but, unlike most others it works without costly data charges when used abroad.

The sister app Nokia Maps now has maps which can be downloaded in advance, and also used without data costs.

These apps can even calculate how long your commute will take. So you’ll have no excuse for being late.

New today is Nokia City Lens, which adds Augmented Reality effects.

Point the phone at a city street to see shop and restaurant names that seem to float in the air, overlaid on the display’s image.

These highly attractive effects can also be used in the maps apps.

Other new features include a much-demanded screenshot function, handy if you want to upload what’s on your screen to Twitter, say, or save the contents of the display so you don’t lose the information when going into a network-free area.
