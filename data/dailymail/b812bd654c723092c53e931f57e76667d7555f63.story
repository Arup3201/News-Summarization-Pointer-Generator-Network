A set of twin boys who were born joined at the chest have celebrated their first birthday with the doctors and nurses who successfully separated them.

Tyler and Tyson Proctor, from Laurel, Maryland, were reunited with the medical team that separated them at Washington's Children's National Health System when they were just two months old.

The healthy youngsters were treated to a Dr. Seuss-inspired cake and 'Thing 1' and 'Thing 2' mini-cakes while the doctors and nurses sang 'happy birthday', NBC Washington reported.

It marked an important milestone for the boys and their family. Tyler and Tyson were born attached at the chests and the stomachs and shared a liver.

After their birth, the medical team created a plastic model of the boys' bodies with a 3D printer, which helped the team plan the surgery.

The model allowed them to answer questions, such as where the boys' gallbladders fell in relation to where they joined. It meant that surgeons could operate without harming either of the boys.

Following their 12-hour separation surgery, Tyson also needed heart surgery before returning home to Tyler and their big sister and brothers.

Today, the toddlers are two happy and healthy boys, often crawling off in different directions.

Their parents, Takoya and Raymond, became emotional as they were reunited with the team.

'You can't do this kind of surgery without this kind of family,' Dr Anthony Sandler told NBC.

'You really need parents like this to do everything that they do. They're part of the team; in fact they lead the team. And without them, the surgery just wouldn't be able to be done.'

The boys were also joined by their 78-year-old great-grandmother, who called them her 'miracle babies'.

'I didn't think they would make it,' she said. 'I was scared. And they made it, and it's awesome. It's really awesome.'
