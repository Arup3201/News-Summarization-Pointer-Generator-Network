A jury decided Williams is eligible for the death penalty for the beating death of his 5-year-old daughter

A federal jury on Friday decided a former Hawaii soldier convicted of murder is eligible for the death penalty in the first capital case in the history of Hawaii's statehood.

Jurors will next deliberate on whether Naeem Williams should be sentenced to death or life in prison with no possibility of release for killing his 5-year-old daughter.

That phase of the trial begins Wednesday and will include a new round of opening statements and evidence.

The same jury last month convicted Williams in his daughter Talia's 2005 beating death. The drawn-out case has gained attention in part because it involves a capital offense in a state that doesn't have the death penalty.

Hawaii's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957, before Hawaii became a U.S. state in 1959.

But Williams was tried in the federal system- which allows for the death penalty- because the crime occurred on military property.

Lawyers for both the prosecution and defense declined comment Friday after the jury's eligibility decision was read.

Williams' defense team argued he was not eligible for a death sentence because of his low IQ. Mental health experts testified about intellectual impairments and low test scores.

The prosecution contended factors such as Talia's age and vulnerability made the killing so heinous that the death penalty was warranted.

Torture: Witnesses testified that Talia Williams, 5, was beaten with belts almost daily when her father became frustrated

Jurors 
decided Williams met all key conditions to be eligible for the death 
penalty: He was an adult; his actions were intentional that resulted in 
the girl's death; and the crime was especially heinous and the victim 
was vulnerable because of her youth.

One juror appeared to cry as jurors were polled.

Williams
 and Talia's stepmother, Delilah Williams, testified during the guilt 
phase of the trial that they beat her almost daily with hands and belts 
during the seven months she lived with them in Hawaii.

Naeem
 Williams blamed the beatings on the child's bowel- and bladder-control 
issues, coupled with frustrations he faced in his marriage.

His
 wife, Delilah, testified against him as part of a deal with prosecutors
 for a 20-year sentence. She provided graphic and disturbing details of 
abuse that included withholding food from the girl for days at a time, 
beatings while the child was duct-taped to a bed, pulling her so hard by
 the hair that she was left with a bald spot, and stomping on her until 
bone cracked.

Coverup: The signs of abuse on the girl's body became so bad that her father pulled her out of kindergarten so nobody would see them

The couple eventually took the kindergartner out of school so that others wouldn't see the signs of abuse on Talia's body.

Prosecutors
 say she died on July 16, 2005, after her father dealt a blow so hard it
 left knuckle imprints on her chest. Naeem Williams said he beat the 
girl that day partly because of toothpaste she spit onto the bathroom 
sink.

The
 resolution of the case also paves the way for Delilah Williams' 
sentence. Her public defender, Alexander Silvert, requested that she be 
immediately sentenced and moved to a mainland prison after she 
testified, satisfying terms of her plea deal.

But
 U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright ruled that Delilah Williams 
must wait until jurors in Naeem Williams' trial have been dismissed 
before she can be sentenced.
