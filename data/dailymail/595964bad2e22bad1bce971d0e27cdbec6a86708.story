Usually when space is short in a big city, developers build up.

But a group of New Yorkers are thinking outside the box with their plans to build a new park underground.

The subterranean public space will be called the Lowline, since it's based off a similar project - the High Line.

Think down: The Lowline is a proposed park to be built in an abandoned underground trolley terminal on Manhattan's Lower East Side

The future of parks: Since undeveloped land is had to come by in New York, one of the project's creators believes that the Lowline can be a 21st century answer to public spaces

Inspiration: The Lowline was in part inspired by the High Line - another recycled industrial space that was turned into a park in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Above, another mock-up of what the Lowline would look like

The High Line was originally built as a set of elevated train tracks in Chelsea. Instead of knocking the tracks down, they were saved and built into a green space.

The brains behind the Lowline have a similar goal for an abandoned space underneath Delancey Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side

Deserted: The abandoned space located on the highlighted area above on Manhattan's Lower East Side, used to be a trolley terminal for trains between Manhattan and Brooklyn but service ended in 1948

Former NASA engineer James Ramsey found out about the disused space on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 2009 from a friend who used to be a subway engineer.

'The Lowline can be the 21st century answer to traditional parks,' Mr Ramsey told The Sunday Times. 'There aren't a lot of empty plots of land in New York just waiting to be turned into new parks. Instead of building up, let's build down.'

No wasting spaces: The High Line was built as a set of elevated train tracks in Chelsea but was recently turned into an above-ground park

The 1.5 acre underground space was built as the Williamsburg Trolley Terminal which transported people to and from Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, but trains stopped running in 1948 with the creation of the J/M/Z subway line.

Since then, the space has been abandoned and now Mr Ramsey and business partner Dan Barasch, a Google marketing executive, want to recycle it into something all New Yorkers can enjoy.  

'Little does anyone know that 
underneath Delancey is this silent beautiful space,' Ramsey told The 
Sunday Times. 'We fell in love with the site because of its 
architectural details: old cobblestones, crisscrossing rail tracks, 
vaulted 20 ft ceilings and strong steel columns.'

But
 one of the biggest challenges to building the estimated $55million park
 a reality was convincing the city and financial backers that the public
 space wouldn't feel like a dungeon.

So
 they came up with an idea for transmitting light underground. They 
invented a technology which absorbs light from panels above ground and 
transmits the light waves under ground through fiber-optics. The
 underground light won't transmit ultraviolet rays which means visitors 
won't get sunburnt. But the light will be powerful enough to allow 
photosynthesis, allowing trees and other plants to grow.

Let there be light: The light produced underground won't have any ultraviolet rays which means visitors can't get a sunburn. But the light will be powerful enough to allow for photosynthesis meaning that trees and other plants can grow in the Lowline

In February 2012, a Kickstarter campaign raised $155,000 which allowed Ramsey and Barasch to build a full-scale model of the lighting technology.

A functioning example of the lighting technology was built and installed in an abandoned warehouse above the site last year. Over 11,000 people visited the exhibit to see proof of the concept.

After the exhibit, the project has gotten much closer to becoming a reality. 

This past summer, nine elected city, state and federal officials signed a letter expressing their support of the project.

The project has also gotten a lot of support from famous New Yorkers like Lena Dunham of HBO's Girls and actor Edward Norton, who himself helped propel the High Line into creation. Dunham and Norton attended the project's star-studded 'anti-gala' last week.

The next step for Ramsey and Barash is to get the transport authority's approval to use the space.

According to the Lowline's website, the group plans to have negotiations finalized, money raised and construction begin sometime between 2014 and 2017 with a 2018 grand opening.

The park is estimated to cost $55million and, if approved, the men hope to see it open sometime in 2018
