Finding an apartment in New York City is hard enough. 

Landing one like these? Nigh on impossible.

For Brooklynites downsizing and ever shifting further east, this throwback to 1970s brownstones will no doubt tug at the heartstrings. 

Many have oak wood floors, some have bay windows.

One is spacious enough for a child to swing around the staircase like a fireman's pole - something New Yorkers today could only dream of. 

In 1978 and 1979, photographer Dinanda Nooney visited around 200 Brooklyn homes, coming out with 2,000 pictures of interiors and the inhabitants.

Here are some of the results.
