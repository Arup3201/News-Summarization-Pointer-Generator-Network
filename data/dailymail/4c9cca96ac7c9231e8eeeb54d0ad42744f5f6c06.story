It is one of the most recognisable pictures ever taken and an image that not only defined a war, but defined the career of the man who took it.

Kim Phuc was just nine years old when she ran naked towards Associated Press photographer and Pulitzer prize winner Huynh Cong 'Nick' Ut screaming 'Too hot! Too hot!' as she headed away from her bombed Vietnamese village.

She will always be remembered for the blobs of sticky napalm that melted through her clothes and left her with layers of skin like jellied lava. Her story has been told many times over the last 40 years since the shot was taken.

But now, to mark four decades since Ut took the picture he has released more moving images that he took during the Vietnam war that chart the horrors of that fateful day in 1972.

Huynh Cong 'Nick' Ut took this picture just moments before capturing his iconic image. It shows bombs with a mixture of napalm and white phosphorus jelly and reveals that he moved closer to the village following the blasts

When compared with the first image it becomes apparent that Ut actually started heading towards the village following the napalm attack. The sign to the right of the picture appears larger while what looks like a speaker to the left of the road is no longer in shot.

As he headed towards the town and took the photo, which Kim Phuc has now found peace with after first wanting to escape the image, he would have been unaware the effect his picture would have on the outside world.

It communicated the horrors of the Vietnam War in a way words could never describe, helping to end one of the most divisive wars in American history.

He drove Phuc to a small hospital. There, he was told the child was too far gone to help. But he flashed his American press badge, demanded that doctors treat the girl and left assured that she would not be forgotten.

'I cried when I saw her running,' said Ut, whose older brother was killed on assignment with the AP in the southern Mekong Delta. 'If I don't help her - if something happened and she died - I think I'd kill myself after that.'

Spending so much time with members of the military he also got time to picture them having fun. Here he pictured youthful civil defence militiamen leap into the flooded Nipa Palm grove near Saigon on April 6, 1969

Never far from devastation, Nick Ut took this picture of journalists photographing a body in the Saigon area in early 1968 during the Tet offensive

Not all his images are full of death and destruction. This one taken on September 20 1970 shows a Cambodian soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in Vietnam

Back at the office in what was then 
U.S.-backed Saigon, he developed his film. When the image of the naked 
little girl emerged, everyone feared it would be rejected because of the
 news agency's strict policy against nudity. But veteran Vietnam photo 
editor Horst Faas took one look and knew it was a shot made to break the
 rules. He argued the photo's news value far outweighed any other 
concerns, and he won.Â 

A couple of days after the image 
shocked the world, another journalist found out the little girl had 
somehow survived the attack. Christopher Wain, a correspondent for ITN 
who had given Phuc water from his canteen and drizzled it down her 
burning back at the scene, fought to have her transferred to the 
American-run Barsky unit. It was the only facility in Saigon equipped to
 deal with her severe injuries.

Not all Ut's images were of death and
 destruction, however, and one taken two years earlier shows a Cambodian
 soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in Vietnam.

Another shows a group of youthful 
civil defence militiamen leaping into the flooded Nipa Palm grove near 
Saigon on April 6, 1969.

Ut became a photographer when he was 
just 16 shortly after his brother, Huynh Thanh My was killed. He joined 
Associated Press under the tutelage of renowned combat photographer, Horst Faas, who died last month.

This picture Kim Phuc running away from her bombed village when she was just nine is now instantly recognisable and seen as a defining image of the Vietnam war

Brought together by the iconic picture, Ut has met regularly with Kim Phuc since the image was taken 40 years after he insisted she be taken to a U.S. hospital

The pair were reunited yesterday at Buena Park, California, as part of celebrations to mark four decades since that fateful meeting

Soon after newspapers in the U.S. 
published is iconic photograph, president Richard Nixon spoke with 
frustration to his chief of staff Harry Haldeman calling it into 
question and suggesting it could have been 'fixed'.

Ut wrote when wires of that 
conversation were released 30 years later: 'Even though it has become 
one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President 
Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in 
the papers on June 12, 1972....

'The picture for me and 
unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo 
was as authentic as the Vietnam war itself. The horror of the Vietnam 
war recorded by me did not have to be fixed.

'That terrified little girl is still 
alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of 
that photo. That moment thirty years ago will be one Kim Phuc and I will
 never forget. It has ultimately changed both our lives.'

His life now could be no different to
 the time he spent charting the horrors of the Vietnam war. He works 
from the bureau's Los Angeles office in Hollywood and submits courtroom 
photographs of celebrities or high-profile legal cases, and his images 
continue to adorn newspapers and websites across the world.

He has paid tribute the 'Napalm girl'
 picture in the past, saying it was behind his being lifted from the 
killing fields of war to take pictures of war.
