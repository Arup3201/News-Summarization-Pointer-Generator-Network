A pensioner who has spent years verbally abusing staff at her local Post Office has finally been banned - after she was dubbed the 'rudest woman they have ever met'.

Angry Elizabeth Smith, 70, can no longer pick up her pension from her branch after she was barred for life her regular tirades.

Workers at the rural Post Office say Elizabeth has been using the shop since 2007 - and is always rude to counter staff.

They say she is 'unpleasant' and regularly 'shouts and screams' and subjects customers and postal employees to 'unfounded abuse'.

Paul Edwards, the postmaster in Porthleven, Cornwall, says she is 'very, very rude' and has finally tired of her antics - and banned her for life.

But the decision won’t come as much of a surprise to Elizabeth - she’s already barred from four local shops, including the cafe and the garden centre.

Mr Edwards said: 'She is very, very rude woman. She comes in and shouts and abuses my staff and they don’t need it.'She’s the sort of woman you can’t reason with. I don’t want her in the store upsetting the staff. I’m afraid it’s gone on too long.

'She even said she would never set foot in here ever again but every other day she was back in here shouting and screaming.

'We have worked really hard to make the store friendly and I think it was for the best that we banned her.

'She is the rudest woman we have ever come across, and I stand by that. She is quite a well-known person.

The 70-year-old was banned after a row over a £10 phone top-up

Elizabeth has been using the shop since 2007 and regularly complains about a number of issues including prices and her pension.

But things finally came to head last week after she launched a tirade of verbal abuse over a failed mobile phone top-up.

She became embroiled in a row at the store when she realised a £10 phone credit top-up had failed.

But despite phone company EE accepting it was at fault and even double her money as a goodwill gesture, the pensioner continued to blame the Post Office.

Paul said: 'She was shouting at 
everyone that we had conned her and were rip-off merchants. It’s just 
not good for staff or our customers.

Lizzie says it's 'ridiculous' to find herself banned from the post office, but admits she 'did get a bit cross'

'She
 staged various sit ins and shouted abuse at everybody. She came back 
and shouted unfounded abuse when we have explained to her that it was 
Orange that were at fault.

'The last straw was when she started telling everybody who came into the store we were rip-off merchants and conmen.'

Mrs Smith admits she 'gets a bit cross' but says the ban is unnecessary.

She said: 'I was told I must not walk across the floor from the door to the post office counter as I’m ‘trespassing’. I’m barred from the shop.

'They said, ‘If you don’t get out we’ll call the police’. I’m 70, with a stick and a dodgy ticker - I wouldn’t take a lot of evicting would I?

'I did get a bit cross I must admit. The following week I went in to get my pension in the normal way and the postmaster started shouting at me. All this over £10 - it’s ridiculous.'
