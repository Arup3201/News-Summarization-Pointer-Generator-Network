A grandmother has become one of the longest-surviving transplant patients in the country after 40 years living with a donated kidney.

Kathleen Hart, 70, underwent a kidney transplant in December 1973, with the organ expected to last for just five years.

The retired postal worker has stunned experts by living with the kidney for eight times as long, and is still the picture of good health.

She believes her good fortune is all the more remarkable because she had her transplant on the traditionally unlucky day of Friday the 13th.

She said: 'It is a wonderful feeling to have proved the experts wrong. And to be told that I am one of the longest survivors in the UK is a real honour and an accolade I am proud of.

'I haven't got a theory why the kidney has lasted so long - I don't have any special food, drink or activity to help things. I suppose I'm just a very, very lucky person.

'And I still feel in great health, hopefully there'll be a few more years in the kidney yet.'

Mrs Hart, of Sutton-in-Craven, West Yorkshire, became ill at the age of 25 but was not aware the problem was linked to her kidneys.

A few years later she was eventually sent to St James's Hospital in Leeds where renal failure was diagnosed.

Mrs Hart only had days to live before she was put on dialysis while an organ donor was found.

She said: 'While I was on dialysis I had to be very careful what I ate and drank, I could never go away on holidays - even in England - and was forced to live a very restricted life.

Mrs Hart has lived for four decades and seen the birth of her two grandchildren

'It was tough, for all the family, at times. But we supported each other, worked through it and it was never a problem as such.'

When a compatible organ became available, her husband Ken, 69, a local councillor, was reluctant for her to have it because he feared the risks.

But Mrs Hart responded to the operation well, and recovered in hospital for three weeks with family members allowed to visit in special sterile clothes.

She said: 'People will say to me 'ooh it's Friday the 13th this week you know' and I'll smile and say back to them 'I know and I can't wait'.

'It's most people's unlucky day but it's my luckiest day and I look forward to them every time one's coming up.

'Before the operation I was never allowed to drink coffee. And I remember after the operation one of the doctors told me not to drink any of the hospital's coffee and said he would go out and fetch me a proper one.

'The taste was divine, I'll never forget that.'

Eventually, when she was allowed home, the couple were able to lead a normal life, going on family holidays and eating out.

It meant that she was able to see her son Robert, 47, grow up and get married, and witness the births of Daniel, 22, and Jennifer, 20.

This week, to celebrate her achievement, she held a special party for family and close friends at the on the anniversary of her surgery.

She added: 'I'm living proof of how vital organ donation is. It really does allow people to live a full and normal life, like we have done. I've been given the gift of life.

'I'm hoping my story shows how important the kidney transplant programme is and that people should continue to donate.'

The Harts never discovered the identity of the organ donor, but they believe it may have been a local girl who died in a car accident.

Lindsey Ledden, of Kidney Research UK, said they had no statistics relating to the longest surviving transplant patients but a transplant usually lasted between 10 and 15 years.

She said: 'More than 6000 people, around 90 per cent of the total organ waiting list, are waiting for a kidney, but less than 3000 transplants are carried out each year.'
