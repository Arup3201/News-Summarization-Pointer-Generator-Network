A Maryland teenager who became paralyzed almost three years ago used a walker to make her mark on the runway during New York Fashion Week.

Megan Silcott's life drastically changed in August 2012 when she woke up paralyzed.

She told GMA 'When I was 16 years old, one night I was out with my friends and I had to come home, I didn't feel that great.

'I went to bed and I woke up in the morning and I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't walk.' 

Silcott had hoped to become a model, according to the news program.

A GoFundMe page for Silcott said the life-altering incident took place on August 16th, 2012.

'She was rushed to the hospital as she soon came to the realization that she was paralyzed,' it said.

The teenager was suffering from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), it emerged.

Silcott's GoFundMe page described it as 'an incredibly rare neurological disorder typically brought on from a viral or bacterial infection. She was unknowingly experiencing silent mono; the type of mono one does not know that they have.'

It continued 'ADEM involves an intense attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately damaging the myelin sheath. In the case of ADEM, the immune response is also responsible for demyelination, a process in which the myelin that covers many nerve fibers is stripped off.'

As part of her treatment, Silcott spent six days in a coma.

'In [an] attempt to decrease the amount of spinal cord and brain swelling to prevent permanent brain damage, there was no other option,' her GoFundMe page said. 

Silcott received treatment from Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute and continues to do so, GMA reported.

'I told myself I was going to heal from this and I was going to be able to pursue everything I wanted to pursue before,' she told the morning news program.

Physical therapist Lizzie Neighbors told GMA 'She started out kind of in the power chair, with not a ton of function in her arms or legs, and she’s progressed to walking with the walker.'

Designer Nina Perdomo revealed the reason she invited Megan to be one of the models, telling GMA 'I design for a woman that is strong and knows what she wants from life. And I feel like Megan is the perfect example of that.'

The New York Daily News reported that Silcott was the first one down the runway on Monday for the Arts Institutes show.

According to the newspaper, the crowd stood up to cheer for Silcott after she was done - and during the finale, Perdomo herself pushed Silcott down the catwalk in a wheelchair.

Silcott's GoFundMe page is seeking $15,000 for 'an FES RT 300 rehabilitation therapy system bike.' Over $12,800 has already been raised.

Silcott herself tweeted Thursday 'Hahaah I looked like an alien on the run way.'
