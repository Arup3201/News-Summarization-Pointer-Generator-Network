Millie Mackintosh reveals her top hosting tips

The glamorous Made In Chelsea star is always showing off her perfectly put-together meals and culinary conquests on social media.

And now Millie Mackintosh reveals her top tips for hosting the perfect dinner party this festive season exclusively to Femail.

Millie's advice comes in light of new research showing two thirds of people (64 per cent) are shunning pubs, restaurants and parties, to instead open their homes to friends and family.

However, this increase in generosity has led to a plethora of problems, with hopeless hosts admitting to a myriad of dinner party disasters.

Problems range from not being prepared enough with food, drink and room dressing (53 per cent) to leaving guests to their own devices while preparing food (28 per cent) and struggling to decide on recipes (15 per cent).

And with almost two thirds (62 per cent) of Britons more likely to host a get together in their homes in the run up to the festive season than during the rest of the year, dilemmas faced by the majority of people, such as what to cook (46 per cent) and planning drinks (26 per cent), is set to increase.

Seven in ten (69 per cent) said  they have had gatecrashers at their gathering (ie neighbours, friends or acquaintances turning up unexpectedly).

One in ten admit to passing off food (such as takeaways) as their own when hosting parties.

And British dinner party hosts revealed they frequently lose essential props such as toilet paper (7 per cent), milk (5 per cent) and seats (28 per cent). 

The poll from  Tassimo has spurred the brand to come up with an 'ultimate solution to the nation's hosting woes' with their Perfect Host panel.

In the run up to Christmas, John will be sharing his top seasonal recipes and kitchen hacks, Millie will tell everyone how to host the perfect gathering, and Hazel will give the low down on what to drink - when and why

Fashion designer Millie Mackintosh, chef John Torode and coffee expert Hazel Middleton have joined forces with the hot drinks machine brand to share their party expertise. 

In the run up to Christmas, John will offer his top seasonal recipes and kitchen hacks, Millie will tell everyone how to host the perfect gathering, and Hazel will give the low down on what to drink - when and why.

Millie said: 'I love this time of year when I have lots of excuses to catch up with friends and family.

'In fact, I'm hosting Christmas at my home for the first time this year. I have just moved into a new house and after appearing on Celebrity Masterchef, expectations from guests are high.'

But she's confident she can help 'the nation fix their hosting horrors,' adding, 'and hopefully I'll learn a thing or two along the way too.'

John Torode added: 'The run-up to Christmas can be a busy and stressful time of year, so I've created a number of delicious recipes and drink suggestions, which are easy to replicate and sure to impress any guest.' 

A Tassimo spokesperson said: 'We know the winter months are an important time of year, with friends and family more likely to catch up over a coffee this festive season than during other times of the year. 

'We are so excited to work with our Perfect Host panel to help Londoners with their drink and dinner dilemmas!'

My go to food when hosting friends is anything in pastry because it is easy and always satisfies everyone. Little pies, tarts, puffs, sausage rolls and those sorts of things work well because both adults and kids alike always love them.

There's nothing better than a coffee morning with a selection of great hot drinks, including cappuccinos and lattes and some lovely cakes and biscuits. 

Nothing complements coffee more than a delicious slice of cake or a crisp biscuit. I like to bake my own cakes for coffee mornings, and this can be done the day before to avoid panic on the morning.
