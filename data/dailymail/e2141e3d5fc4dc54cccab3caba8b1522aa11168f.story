Police are treating the death of a strangled 82-year-old man as a possible ‘assisted suicide’. 

His 75-year-old wife has been bailed while officers await instructions from the Crown Prosecution Service on how to treat the case. 

Thames Valley Police’s handling of the death appears to be unprecedented, as those taking the life of a victim are usually investigated for murder or manslaughter.

The body of the man, named by neighbours as John Sampford, a retired coach-painter, was discovered when police were called to a house at Bancroft Park, Milton Keynes, in the early hours of Friday.

Police arrested his wife, Sheila, but released her on bail until a date next month. They are not looking for anyone else in relation to the death which post mortem results indicate was caused by strangulation. The couple had been happily married for 50 years. Mr Sampford had been diagnosed with leukaemia and was said to have been given only three months to live. 

Assisted suicide – or actively helping someone to kill themselves – is illegal under the 1961 Suicide Act.  

Conservative MP Mark Pritchard, who is vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: ¿If a crime has been committed the police must investigate'.

Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘We are now consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service as to how this case should be carried forward.

Our focus is to establish the exact circumstances around the death to best understand what and how it happened.’ 

But MPs last night criticised Thames Valley Police for an apparent ‘positional shift’ in deciding how an apparent homicide should be investigated. 

Conservative MP Mark Pritchard, who is vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: ‘If a crime has been committed the police must investigate. It is not the police’s job to write the law, that is for Parliament. And it is not the police’s job to interpret the law, that is for the courts.’

Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who has also been campaigning on pro-life issues, said: ‘This case should be treated as murder. The law states that assisted suicide is illegal.’ 

New guidelines on how to handle assisted suicide cases were issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, in 2010.

The guidance, issued after MS-sufferer Debbie Purdy sought legal assurances that her partner would not be prosecuted for helping her die, states: ‘Assisted suicide refers to helping someone take his or her own life . . . taking someone’s life, as opposed to, helping them to take their own life, is murder or manslaughter.’

The CPS said: ‘We have had contact with Thames Valley Police, but we have not received the file yet.’
