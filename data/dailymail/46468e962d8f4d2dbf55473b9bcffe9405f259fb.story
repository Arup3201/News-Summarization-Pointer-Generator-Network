A prankster who took Ellen DeGeneres up on a 'dance dare' has launched a $5 million lawsuit against the NYPD after claiming he was thrown to the ground after performing behind them. 

Alexandre Nzebele alleges he was roughed up by six police officers after he filmed himself dancing Gangnam-style behind them as they stood behind a vehicle outside Grand Central.

Mr Nzebele, 22, filed a claim against the city and NYPD in the Manhattan federal court yesterday. 

Prankster Alexandre Nzebele has launched a $5 million lawsuit against the city and the NYPD claiming the officers threw him to the ground while he was performing a dare for a segment of Ellen DeGeneres' TV show

After noticing Mr Nzebele dancing behind them, the officers turned around and held him against their vehicle

He was shooting a video of himself for Ellen's 'Dance Dare' segment of her daytime television show; Ellen is pictured above during an episode of her show with actress Nicole Kidman  

He says he was shooting a video of himself for Ellen's 'Dance Dare' segment on her daytime show that urges 'people to film themselves dancing behind strangers without them being aware of it', when the incident happened. 

A video of the 22-year-old dancing behind people and eventually allegedly being pushed to the ground by officers has since gone viral. Mr Nzebele can be heard saying 'I'm sorry' during the altercation. 

Mr Nzebele claims the officers said: 'What the f— is wrong with you?', 'are you f—ing kidding me?', 'what are you dancing in the street for?'. 

The incident came at a time when police were on edge. It occurred just four days after two uniformed officers in Brooklyn were shot dead in their car and following the Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict an officer for the chokehold that contributed to Eric Garner's death. 

Mr Nzebele's lawyer Robert Tolchin told the New York Post that he understands some 'police officers were on edge … but that does not give them a right to manhandle the public or violate people's rights.'

The pranksters victims are generally completely unaware he is dancing behind them, and as they become suspicious he stops he stops; Mr Nzebele's lawyer says his client was was intimidated, insulted and thrown to the ground 'without any legal cause whatsoever'

Mr Tolchin went on to tell the newspaper that those incidents did not give officers the right to 'resort to street justice'.

He claims his client was intimidated, insulted and thrown to the ground 'without any legal cause whatsoever'.  

Mr Tolchin added: 'Dancing is not a crime. 

'People have the right to stand in the street and express themselves.'

Mr Nzebele, who also goes by the name 'Alexander BOK' online - says the officer involved in the incident never asked him to stop dancing, or to do so elsewhere.   

The city Law Department has reportedly said it would 'review the lawsuit once it is served.'
