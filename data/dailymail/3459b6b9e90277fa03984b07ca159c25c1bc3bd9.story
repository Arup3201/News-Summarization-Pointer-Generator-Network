A woman was diagnosed with a serious heart condition after her neck started pulsating violently.

The 33-year-old Canadian woman’s abnormal pulse alerted doctors to the fact she had a condition caused by a faulty heart valve

She was diagnosed with the heart condition tricuspid regurgitation.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition
 which occurs when the heart's tricuspid valve does not close properly, 
meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when
 the right lower heart chamber contracts.

The valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber.

When it is faulty the pressure in the blood vessels can change.

This can lead to the abnormal pulses seen in the Canadian patient’s neck, LiveScience reports.

The condition is usually caused by the 
enlargement of the right ventricle but can also develop if the valve is 
damaged by an infection.

A 33-year-old Canadian woman's neck started to pulsate as a result of a heart condition. She had a damaged heart valve which caused her abnormal pulse but she recovered after surgery to replace the valve

In this patient’s case, she had previously had MRSA.

The unnamed woman’s case was described in the New England Journal of Medicine.

She required an operation to replace her damaged tricuspid valve and has since made a full recovery.

The case was reported by researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, in Canada.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart's tricuspid valve does not close properly meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts.

The valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber.

The most common cause of tricuspid regurgitation is the enlargement of the right ventricle which pumps blood to the lungs.

The condition can also develop if the valve is damaged by a bacterial infection.

Symptoms include pulsing neck veins, fatigue, swelling of the abdomen and weakness.

If the condition is not causing many symptoms, no treatment is necessarily required.

In more severe cases, surgery is required to repair or replace the valve.

People with severe cases of tricuspid regurgitation have a poor prognosis if it cannot be corrected.

The unnamed 33-year-old Canadian woman had a damaged heart valve as a result of developing MRSA - the damaged valve caused an abnormal pulse

This made the blood vessels in her neck throb dramatically

Had to have surgery to replace the damaged valve and has now recovered
