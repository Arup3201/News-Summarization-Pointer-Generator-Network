Rory McIlroy could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build-up to the first round of the DP World Tour Championship on Thursday – and it showed as he made a blistering start.

The world No 1 had taken to social media to express his feelings. 'Just under 3 hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in 6 weeks. To say I’m excited is an understatement,' he tweeted, complete with the hashtag: imready.

Out on the course, the world No 1 looked more than ready, as he went round in a fabulous 66 to be tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry and lower still further his staggering stroke average on an Earth course that most players consider rather difficult.

Rory McIlroy has made a brilliant start to the DP World Tour Championship

In 21 rounds here, McIlroy is now a scarcely believable 80 under par, and he has never shot worse than the regulation figure of 72 – and there’s only been one of those. As for the other 20 rounds he has had: six 66s, five 67s, two 68s, two 69s and five 71s.

His start in particular on Thursday was mesmerising. You might have thought there would be a touch of early rust after an extended period of inactivity but not a bit of it.

One brilliant shot followed another and he stood on the sixth tee at four under par. Not just the Race to Dubai, but this tournament looked as if it was going to be all over bar the shouting long before the 72nd hole as well.

Not getting the fairly routine birdie four at the long 7th stopped the momentum, as a string of prosaic pars followed. Indeed, McIlroy had to show off a touch of magic around the green at the difficult par four 12th to prevent registering his first dropped shot.

The 25-year-old returned to the birdie trail by rolling in a nice 12ft putt at the 15th before notching his sixth gain with a similar length putt at the next hole.

Lowry is currently 52nd in the world and needs to break into the top 50 by the end of this event to secure a first appearance at the Masters. He has been on the cusp of making it for the last month but blew a great chance with a poor final round at the Turkish Airlines Open last week. ‘It has been on my mind for a while,’ he admitted.

Lowry made his score with a wonderful finish that saw him birdie four of the last six holes. The pair finished one stroke ahead of exciting Dane Thobjorn Olesen and Scot Richie Ramsay, while in-form Henrik Stenson, playing alongside McIlroy, shot a fine 68.

Comeback of the day came from Justin Rose, who was four over par for the tournament after a terrible first ten holes. But he played the next eight in five under for a gutsy 71.

Ian Poulter’s conversation about putting with Australian Greg Norman on Tuesday night produced no immediate dividend as he stumbled to a poor 75 – and his hopes of finishing the season with a first victory in two years are almost certainly over.

Young Englishman Tommy Fleetwood shot 69, while Lee Westwood shot 70. Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, Welshman Jamie Donaldson and US Open Champion Martin Kaymer from Germany had to settle for rounds of 72.
