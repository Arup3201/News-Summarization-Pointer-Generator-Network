Doctors may warn that processed meat is bad for your health, but one grandmother said it is the reason she has lived to be 105.

Pearl Cantrell, from Richland Springs, Texas, says eating bacon every day is the secret of her long life.

She is so passionate about bacon that she encourages people to eat more of it.

Mrs Cantrell told local TV station KRBC: 'I love bacon, I could eat it for every meal - and I do.

'I want other people to eat bacon. I tell them too. My kids all eat it.'

A local producer, who shares her love of processed meat, organised a treat in the food van, dubbed the 'Wienermobile', followed by a gift of even more bacon.

Abraham Luna, who works for Oscar Mayer's company, told the TV station: 'We have seen a lot of thing on the road but not quite like this one.

'We know she is an inspiration for the community and friends and family so we had to make a special stop here for her.'

Mrs Cantrell seems not to want to eat anything but bacon and will happily have a plate of fried rashers by themselves.Â

Mrs Cantrell's daughter Anno Richards said her mother was moved by the gesture, according to news.com.au.

She said: 'She had a hard life raising all of us, so she deserves all of this.

'And I think this today, will keep her going, she will talk about this for months.'

Unfortunately, Pearl's diet claims are not backed up by scientists.

In March this year, a Europe-wide study of almost half a million men and women linked processed meat to deaths from cancer and heart disease.

The research found that eating more than 20g a day of processed meat - equal to one rasher of cheap bacon - could be to blame for about one in 30 deaths.
