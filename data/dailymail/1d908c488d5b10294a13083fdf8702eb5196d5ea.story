A man charged with murder was accidentally released from a Los Angeles jail one month ago because of a clerical error, LA County Sheriff's authorities have now revealed.

Sheriff's Capt. Chuck Antuna says 32-year-old Johnny Mata was let out of the Los Angeles Inmate Reception Center downtown on April 4 and has not been seen since.

Antuna said Mata was charged with murder for an alleged gang shooting in Baldwin Park in 2010. However, the inmate was released before a clerk entered a hold for him.

On the loose: Johnny Mata, 32, charged with murder in a 2010 gang shooting, was mistakenly freed from a Los Angeles jail last month and hasn't been seen since

'Mata’s release should not have occurred because a murder charge had been filed by the District Attorney and a processing clerk had not yet entered it as a "hold" on inmate Mata,' a statement by the sheriff's department read.

Authorities say they realized the mistake the next day.

'The detectives were actively searching for him and finally decided to ask for the public's help today,' Nicole Nishida of the sheriff's department told the Baldwin Park Patch.

Antuna said authorities announced the error on Friday and sought the public's help after being unable to find Mata the past month.

Wanted: Mata, described as a Latino man, 6 feet, 1 inch tall, 197 pounds, is also heavily tattooed as seen here

Antuna says that since 2012 the department, which processes 150,000 inmate releases annually, has had seven similar errors.

'The thing is that all were immediately apprehended but Mr Matas is still outstanding,' Capt Chuck Antuna of the LA County Sheriff's Dept told KCAL.

Matas is described as a Latino man, 6 feet, 1 inch tall, 197 pounds.

Anyone with information about Mata's whereabouts are asked to call sheriff’s homicide detectives at (323) 890-5500. Anonymous tipsters call LA Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (8477), texting the letters TIPLA plus your tip to CRIMES (274637), or going to lacrimestoppers.org.
